Renewing his attack on the press, Mr Campbell said that Morgan should stand down if the photographs of Iraqi prisoners being abused by British soldiers were a hoax, because too much was at stake. \"If they are genuine, then it's perfectly reasonable. If they are staged for political or for commercial reasons, then that's unacceptable in public life. Mr Campbell - who was appearing before parliament's public administration committee as a witness into its investigation of the Phillis report, which examined the breakdown of trust between politicians, the media and public - implied that Morgan was acting beyond his duties and trying to take a political role. This, he said, meant he had to take responsibility for the effect of the torture story on troops in Iraq - and should be prepared to resign if necessary. \"When you decide it's no longer enough to be a national newspaper editor, and you want to be a political player... when you decide to be a player, then sometimes you have to face up to the rules of the political game as well. If it emerges that these pictures are false, staged, then his position is untenable\" said Mr Campbell, who once worked as a journalist on the Mirror. Mr Campbell also renewed his attack on the Daily Mail and its editor, Paul Dacre, who he once described as \"the most poisonous man in British public life\". \"The vast bulk, 90 to 95%, of what gets derided as 'spin' is put there by newspapers with an agenda,' he said in reference to the mid-market tabloid. The former government spin chief has fought an increasingly bitter battle with the Mail and Dacre since the publication of the Hutton report last year. Today, he returned to the battle with gusto, calling the Mail \"vile\". \"I would say the Hutton inquiry was the culmination of a systematic strategic campaign - led by the Conservative Party and helped by the Daily Mail - to plant in people's minds the idea that you can't believe a word people say.\" He dismissed the idea that his departure had led to the restoration of more cordial relations between No 10 and the press. Dacre, appearing before the same committee earlier this year, said that Mr Campbell's departure had \"drained quite a lot of the poison\" out of the relationship. Mr Campbell said that he had \"seen precious little evidence of the poison being drained from his pen, or that of his newspaper.\" He placed the majority of the blame for the breakdown in trust and growing voter apathy at the door of the media, saying they had their own agenda and were unprepared to look at their own role. He did, however, admit that the government spin machine should have been less controlling in the early years after Labour's 1997 election victory. The practice of announcing the same batch of funding several times, for example, should have been \"left at the door of No 10\", he said. But Mr Campbell insisted that the media would have to change if there was to be progress. \"If you've got the bulk of newspapers where news and comments are completely fused, it's very hard to find where news ends and comment begins. If some of them do develop an obsession with me, there will be some members of the public who will believe it.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
