The red-carpet event is expected to be attended by most of the cast \u2013 and no one will be more excited than three largely unknown British actors who are set to play a major role this season. Jessica Henwick, Toby Sebastian and Nell Tiger Free have all landed key parts in one of this season\u2019s most eagerly awaited plotlines \u2013 events in the much-discussed but until now unseen Principality of Dorne, where a substantial part of the new season is expected to take place. Given Game of Thrones\u2019 track record in spotting the stars of tomorrow \u2013 younger cast members have gone on to everything from big-budget blockbusters, such as the latest X-Men movie, to critically acclaimed independent fare \u2013 all eyes will be on Henwick, Sebastian and Tiger Free as their characters manoeuvre their way through the always tricky politics of Westeros. Of the three, 22-year-old Henwick, who starred in the CBBC adventure series Spirit Warriors before playing barrister pupil Amy Lang in the legal drama Silk, is probably the best known. She has been cast as Nymeria Sand, one of Oberyn Martell\u2019s daughters, a group of not-to-be-messed-with warrior princesses known as the Sand Snakes. \u201cWe\u2019d auditioned Jessica a lot \u2013 including for the new Star Wars movie [unconfirmed reports suggest she has a role in that film] \u2013 so I knew her pretty well,\u201d says Game of Thrones\u2019 casting director, Nina Gold. \u201cWe knew she\u2019d be a good fit.\u201d Relative newcomer Sebastian will play Oberyn\u2019s nephew, Trystane Martell, and is better known as a flamenco musician, though he has a small part in the forthcoming action comedy Barely Lethal with Hailee Steinfeld and Jessica Alba. \u201cWe knew Toby more because he\u2019d done a lot of music things in the past, but he has a really romantic feel that just worked,\u201d says Gold of the striking young actor, whose part is thought to have been significantly changed from the books. The third member of the British trio, 15-year-old Nell Tiger Free, takes on the role of Cersei Lannister\u2019s daughter Myrcella, last seen being sent to Dorne as part of a political marriage deal. She replaces Aimee Richardson in the role; no explanation for the change has been given. \u201cNell is really brilliant,\u201d says Gold. \u201cWe\u2019d seen her in [indie film] Broken and she had a great natural style. She\u2019s a very talented young actresswho\u2019s going to go far.\u201d While Game of Thrones has been celebrated for its astute casting of young unknowns, most notably Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner who play the show\u2019s beleaguered Stark sisters, it\u2019s not averse to the odd piece of big name window-dressing. Earlier seasons have seen the likes of Diana Rigg and Charles Dance take key roles and this season\u2019s star catch is Jonathan Pryce, hot off his turn as Cardinal Wolsey in Wolf Hall, which Gold also cast, and playing a very different man of faith with a mission that will have lasting repercussions for many in the capital of King\u2019s Landing. \u201cNow and then we have the opportunity to cast someone with more of a profile,\u201d says Gold. \u201cI\u2019d say each season we get one really great well-known actor, and getting Jonathan was really satisfying because he\u2019s someone I\u2019ve always wanted to cast.\u201d The other piece of eye-catching casting is that of former child star Keisha Castle-Hughes, Oscar-nominated at 13 for The Whale Rider, who will play the oldest Sand Snake, Obara. Castle-Hughes reportedly pushed for a role because she was a fan of Martin\u2019s books \u2013 and Gold admits they are inundated with requests from people desperate to appear. \u201cWe do get amazing messages from fabulous people saying they\u2019d like a part \u2013 I saw Danny Dyer saying he\u2019d been turned back three times. I honestly don\u2019t remember that but he must have been. People are really keen to be on the show.\u201dNot surprisingly, given the boost it can give a career. Former Soldier Soldier star Jerome Flynn banished two decades\u2019 worth of Robson &amp; Jerome memories with a swashbuckling turn as cynical mercenary Bronn, while established stars from Stephen Dillane to Iain Glen have carved out a part of Westeros to call their own. \u201cWe have so many conversations where we say, \u2018Oh he\u2019s very Game of Thrones but what role?\u201d Gold admits. \u201cGenerally we\u2019re looking for people who are going to bring something original to the part. With Jerome he hadn\u2019t been that keen to do stuff for a while, but the character and the world really appealed to him. Similarly, [Scottish actor] Rory McCann really took his character [the tormented royal bodyguard Sandor Clegane] and made it live.\u201d Does she worry about getting it wrong? \u201cWe get a pretty good brief and then it\u2019s largely about instinct. Young actors are a risk because there\u2019s so much growing up and developing to do, and the men are generally harder because those parts are so unlike 21st-century men. The trickiest was probably Oberyn Martell. We try not to get wound up by negative feedback and [Chilean actor] Pedro Pascal was really successful in the end, but he was the hardest to cast.\u201d Seasons one to four of Game of Thrones are currently available on demand through Sky Box Sets and NOW TV"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
