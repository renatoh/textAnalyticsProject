Darren Ferguson's Peterborough United played six games in March and this hugely convincing victory over the league leaders was win number six. Leicester are now four points clear with six games remaining after goals in each half from Charlie Lee and Chris Whelpdale condemned Nigel Pearson's side to their second defeat in 27 games. The only surprising thing about this win was that it was not by a greater margin, such was their dominance \u2013 particularly in a second half when both sides were given the opportunity to play the fine football they are capable of as the swirling gale that delivered sheets of rain throughout the first half subsided. In that first 45 minutes neither team looked equipped for the promotion to the Championship that looks more and more likely for both after this result \u2013 but the conditions exempt both from stern criticism as playing the ball in the air was made impossible by the wind and keeping it on the ground was not an option as the playing surface tore up underfoot. Charlie Lee compensated for the paucity of entertainment in the opening 44 minutes with a wonderful goal. The centre-half began as a trainee midfielder at Tottenham and he displayed some of that attacking nous when he collected Joe Mattock's weak headed clearance of Paul Coutts's corner, a nifty drag-back left Patrick Kisnorbo on his backside and created the space for the 22-year-old to curl his fourth goal of the season into the top left-hand corner. Craig Mackail-Smith has netted 19 times in the league, three fewer than Leicester's Matty Fryatt (who was anonymous here), but he missed very good opportunities in the second half when his pace twice put him in behind a Leicester defence pushed dangerously high up the pitch. His wastefulness was to go unpunished thanks to a quite majestic piece of play from the former non-league striker. Tight to the right-hand sideline, he controlled a 40-yard pass dead, as if the ball were a bag of sand tossed to him from 40 inches. He jinked to avoid a couple of hapless tackles before pinging a 30-yard crossfield ball into the path of Chris Whelpdale. The right-sided midfielder took one touch before striking a low, hard shot across Tony Warner from 16 yards. Ferguson was watching at this stage from the stands, five yards behind the dugout, after being sent off by referee Chris Foy. He later dismissed the incident, choosing instead to herald his team's act of revenge after December's 4-0 destruction at the Walkers Stadium. \"I spoke at length before the game about what they did to us down there,\" he said. \"How we felt after the game in the dressing room is a horrible feeling and it is chalk and cheese with how we feel today.\" Pearson had no complaints, admitting the better side won, and despite taking four points from the past four games, he thinks Leicester are still in the box seat. \"I've said from day one that it is where you are in May that matters and we've done very well this season to put ourselves in the position that we're in.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
