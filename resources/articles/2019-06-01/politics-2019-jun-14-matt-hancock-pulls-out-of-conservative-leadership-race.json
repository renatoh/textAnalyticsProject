Hancock, the health secretary, was the youngest of the seven contenders remaining after Thursday\u2019s first round, but announced on Friday he was withdrawing after coming sixth out of the seven. \u201cI ran as the candidate of the future, but the party is understandably looking for a candidate for the unique circumstances we face right now,\u201d he said in a statement, not saying who he might back next. Hancock will spend the weekend weighing up the merits of Johnson and Michael Gove, having declined an offer from Sajid Javid to form an alliance of \u201cchange candidates\u201d. Hancock was said to have feared that with Javid\u2019s support only just ahead of his own \u2013 the home secretary got 23 votes \u2013 he would be backing a candidate who might struggle to make it beyond Tuesday\u2019s second round. Hancock held a meeting with Javid on Thursday, but sources in the health secretary\u2019s campaign said the discussion had not been fruitful. Gove\u2019s team had also been making overtures to Hancock, believing their candidate could take on Johnson most effectively. The Johnson ally Gavin Williamson opened channels of communication with the Hancock camp on Thursday, as it became clear he had little hope of progressing further, the Guardian understands. Unlike Rory Stewart, Hancock has been careful not to criticise Johnson during the campaign \u2013 apart from repudiating reported anti-business comments. Hancock is a former adviser and longtime ally of George Osborne, whose Evening Standard editorial on Thursday appeared to be edging closer to supporting Johnson. The same newspaper ran an editorial on Friday praising Hancock as \u201cpart of the Conservative future\u201d and a candidate who had \u201claid out the home truths facing the new prime minister on Brexit\u201d. While he has staked his bid for No 10 on delivering Brexit by 31 October, Johnson has also stressed his pro-business credentials, and said in an interview on Friday he would pursue \u201cmodern, progressive Conservatism\u201d in office \u2013 similar language to that used by Hancock in his own campaign pitch. The next steps for Hancock, as well as Javid, are unclear. One Hancock supporter said a \u201cdream ticket\u201d somehow combining Gove, Javid and Hancock, could still emerge. Javid remains an outsider, and could struggle to reach the 33-vote tally needed to reach the next round. A supporter of the home secretary said part of his pitch would be to accept that Johnson would inevitably win and seek to persuade Conservative MPs to put him in the final two to be voted on by party members as a way of illustrating the Tories\u2019 new image. \u201cEven if you think Boris is a shoo-in, then you need to think about who\u2019s best placed to test him,\u201d they said. \u201cYou also might want to think: who else do we want on TV for four to six weeks, representing the party? How about someone who makes it look good, and look different?\u201d There is also the issue of whom Hancock\u2019s supporters might now back. One said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a unified view \u2013 some to Michael Gove, or Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt.\u201d May\u2019s former de facto deputy Damian Green is among Hancock\u2019s public backers. On Friday he tweeted: \u201cI am proud to have supported Matt Hancock and the values he stands for. He will be a great PM one day. Meanwhile, to all candidates, until Monday, Do Not Disturb.\u201d Hancock\u2019s pitch to his colleagues had been that he was best-placed to appeal to voters in the centre ground of British politics, but that meant appealing to a similar group of MPs to Stewart. The international development secretary received 19 votes but has said he is determined to continue with his quixotic #RoryWalks campaign, insisting he is the best person to take on his fellow old Etonian Johnson. Hancock told the Guardian on Wednesday: \u201cOf course we\u2019ve got to deliver Brexit; but then we\u2019ve got to win a majority by appealing to aspirational people in the centre ground of British politics, where there\u2019s a gaping hole.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are some candidates who won\u2019t be able to bring the Conservative party with them, and there are others who will find it more difficult to reach into the centre ground. I think I\u2019m best placed to be able to do both.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
