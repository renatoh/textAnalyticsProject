India, who have struggled to make an impact in their five previous World Cups, are now a slick outfit and lack nothing in terms of fitness, skill or fielding ability. Charlotte Edwards, only 25 but an old hand at international level, and Arran Brindle, a schoolgirl prodigy starting to make an impact, scored half-centuries for England, but there was precious little else by way of contributions from their team-mates as Jhulan Goswami took four for 27. Despite England's modest total it required a stout fourth-wicket partnership between Anjum Chopra and Rumeli Dhar to rescue India from 35 for three in the 20th over. The pair put on an unbeaten stand of 106 after England had dismissed the India captain Mithali Raj in thrilling fashion. Raj drove uppishly at Jenny Gunn and Brindle snatched a diving one-handed catch at extra cover. Anju Jain and Jaya Sharma followed but England's lack of back-up for their frontline bowlers - Lucy Pearson, Kathryn Brunt and Clare Connor - eased the pressure on India, who managed only eight runs in their first 10 overs. The England coach Richard Bates said: \"We didn't really get enough runs on the board. It was a blip but we're looking forward to good performances in the rest of our matches.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
