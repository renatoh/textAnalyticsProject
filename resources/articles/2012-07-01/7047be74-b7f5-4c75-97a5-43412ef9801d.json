In fact it has been around since at least the 15th century, as a discovery from a vault in a castle in East Tyrol, Austria taught us this week. Pants, not so much. It was only men who were supposed to wear them in those days, but \"breast bags\" or \"tuttensecks\" as they were then called \u2026 well, look at this picture. Not entirely unlike what you might have lurking in your second drawer down, having been through one too many non-delicates spin cycles. Honestly, you should see the one I have on now, held together with one rusty hook and literally in elasticated shreds with overuse. But then doesn't one always tend to have an old favourite? Isn't it a bit like a security blanket, the sort of thing you like to sleep with when you are alone? Should we be surprised that they've existed this long? I don't see why. If, like me, you've not exactly got cherry pips, you'll want to know why cave women didn't wear them too. There's the \"Hello, Boys\" idea that we wear them \u2013 and that they are sold to us \u2013 to make us objects of male gratification, yes, yes, blah blah blah \u2026 but isn't a bra's basic, over-riding function to strap the things down and stop them flapping all over the place, as opposed to putting them on display? Growing up in the 70s in Islington, I remember my mum having plenty of lefty friends who never wore bras. It went along with the whole Jesus sandal/bring your pet goat/mi casa su casa atmosphere she assiduously cultivated when my sister and I were growing up. Perhaps that is why I'm at my most comfortable being trussed up within an inch of my life. On a very primal level, going without a bra makes me feel nervous. Get them out in context, by all means, but on the tube, in broad daylight, with young people around? Friends can laugh away, and they do, but there's nothing that empowers me more, sets me up for my day than one of my nice \"polo neck\" sports bras. And, nothing, but nothing, in my book, looks worse than an ageing cleavage. There is evidence of even earlier bra-wearing. According to Beatrix Nutz, an archaeological researcher at the University of Innsbruck, women in early 14th-century France would put two bags into their dresses to go over each bosom, and then bind them down in place, hence the term \"breast bag\". To simulate the experience, you could always try doing the same with Baco Press'n'Seal sandwich bags. I suppose there will always be a market for push-up bras. Personally, I'm just waiting for that lady from Spanx to do a modern take on the Graeco-Roman breast band \u2013 a strip of fabric or leather wound round and round, bandage-style, to flatten rather than enhance. Maybe what I'm talking about is a wetsuit, though. Christa D'Souza on Twitter: @shithomemaker Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett The Wonderbra came to prominence in the 1990s, and by the time my generation hit puberty at the end of that laddish decade, we'd been convinced that bigger was better. The whole concept of the bra (and the amazing feats of engineering of which it was supposedly capable) had been fetishised to such an extent that we couldn't wait to get our hands on one, whether we were ready for it or not. Getting a bra was a sort of status symbol. My first bra, bought for me by my mother on my continued insistence, was superfluous. I was 11, and as flat as a pancake. I didn't need it (and still don't), yet I longed to have that dark line of cleavage that appears when breasts are smushed together by sturdy underwiring. It wasn't \"breasts\" that I was after so much as \"boobs\". Sexy, cheeky, man-pleasing mounds of balloon-like flesh. I blame Ginger Spice. No longer did girls stuff their bras with tissues. No: our generation had the benefit of gel-filled bras that claimed to boost your size to that of a Loaded cover star. Yet they came packaged with the worry that were a boy ever to put his hand up there, he'd be somewhat disappointed at what he found. At that age, the bra was tied up with the kind of plastic sexuality that makes me cringe now. The bra is not oppressive, but the way it is marketed often is and, while a good bra can be glorious, the bad ones are eminently more flammable. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett edits the feminist blog the Vagenda Michele Hanson The discovery of some 600-year-old bras in an Austrian castle just shows how sensible medieval women were. Brassieres are essential, I find, for comfort, and to stop things moving around too much. Not that I ever wanted one as a girl, or any bosoms to put in it. Who wants wobbling lumps on their chest, and then to be trussed up like a turkey in these ghastly contraptions? But it had to happen, so I wore a plain, cotton, medieval-style one, ending up with an unexceptional M&amp;S 36B, more or less for life, until my 50s, when daughter bossed me into Rigby &amp; Peller for a birthday treat. Magic. I went in a boring old drab, and came out all Dolly Parton. Of course, it was fairly harrowing, facing one's sagging body in a big mirror, in front of a perfectly formed and stylish assistant, horrified by the dreary, worn-out old 36B, but soon she was brandishing a heavenly, dark blue, lace brassiere that fitted me like a glove. And guess what? It was size 32E! Wow! What glamour. The brassiere changed my shape completely and gave me a novel feeling of confidence. How had I spent decades not knowing this? Would my life have been different in 32Es? I bought two. But now it's nearly my birthday again, the fabulous brassieres are worn out, and it's time to face the mirror and buy some more. Will they still be 32E? Fingers crossed. Jacqueline Gold When I first started in the [lingerie] business 30 years ago, bras were very different. Then you could really only get practical bras, and the sexy bras were designed with men in mind. Now, bras have become more of a fashion piece. We design bras to be seen \u2013 it's driven much more by pop culture, by stars like Rihanna, Christina Aguilera and Lady Gaga, and before them Madonna. Another of the biggest changes is in women's bust sizes. There's an ever-increasing demand for size-30 bras with an H cup, because women's shapes are changing, and some women are having breast enhancements. I was 13 when I got my first bra and it was, rightly, simple and supportive \u2013 but all bras were then, not just those for teenagers. There weren't sexy bras on the high street. Every store now recognises that lingerie has to tick a lot of boxes \u2013 it's not just functional, it has to be sexy and stylish, flattering, a perfect fit. Sexy lingerie used to be designed for women to wear in order to turn men on, but that isn't the case any more. Early in my career I had a stand at a women's exhibition in Bristol, and I remember this feminist coming over and smashing her hand through the catalogues I was holding, and being quite aggressive. But the difference today is that now we have a lot more equality in our personal and work lives, so sex and sexuality isn't just being driven by men. I don't know how many bras I own \u2013 I have a chest of drawers full of bras. I love wearing different bras every day, just as I love wearing different outfits. When I think about my outfit, I think about my bra too. I want it to match my thong and complement what I'm wearing. I never wear non-matching sets, but I think that's all about wanting to feel confident underneath. It doesn't matter who sees it, or who doesn't see it, it's about how it makes me feel. Jacqueline Gold is chief executive of Ann Summers and Knickerbox Simon Hattenstone Bras. I'd dreamed of them for years. Well, breasts \u2013 and the two went hand in glove, almost metaphorically speaking. Little did I realise what a nightmare they'd be; how they were ingeniously designed to a) stop girls from sagging and b) humiliate clumsy, priapic boys. I still sweat when I think about those first blind fumblings. The trouble is, it often happens in the dark. And if it's not dark, your eyes are shut. And if your eyes are not shut, they should be \u2013 because otherwise you don't mean it. So, eyes shut, semi-dark, on my bed with almost-girlfriend, sticky hand edging up her jumper. Imagine late 70s, Buzzcocks' Ever Fallen in Love playing on my music centre, and me in rhapsodies at the way life imitates punk. Wow! She wasn't wearing one. Brilliant. So I vigorously, started kneeding and primping and massaging and tweeking the one breast I'd found, thinking this is what sex and adulthood is all about. Just two problems \u2013 why wasn't she moaning ecstatically like in the movies, and where was the nipple? It took a good half hour before I realised I was attending to her shoulder. So embarrassed, and a little ashamed, I withdrew, and concentrated on my spitty, breathless kissing before having another go. Yes! Found it. All silky and heaving and full. No mistake this time. But I didn't know about clips. True, I'd practised undoing my sister's bra (not when she was in it, I hasten to add), but that was quite different from the real thing. For starters, I could use my eyes. My fingers were hot and shaky, they didn't know whether to pull or push, and every attempt I made ended in an echo-chamber ping. So I went under and over, and in between, and almost certainly destroyed the bra as well as causing my almost-girlfriend considerable discomfort. Eventually she undid it for me. That didn't feel like the great triumph it should have been."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
