The 74-year-old dramatist has spent the bulk of his time in recent years as a passionate campaigner against the prime minister and the conflict in Iraq. In an outstanding writing career that has spanned four decades, Pinter has produced some of modern theatres most memorable works. His plays, the best-known of which include The Caretaker, The Homecoming and The Birthday Party, have met with heartfelt critical approbation, and his announcement today will come as a blow to the many people in the theatre world who regard him as Britain's greatest living playwright. Pinter explained his decision in an interview with Mark Lawson, due to be aired on Radio 4's Front Row at 7.15pm this evening. \"I've written 29 plays. Isn't that enough?\" he asked. \"I think it's enough for me. I've found other forms now. My energies are going in different directions - over the last few years I've made a number of political speeches at various locations and ceremonies ... I'm using a lot of energy more specifically about political states of affairs, which I think are very, very worrying as things stand.\" Last November Pinter was among a group of celebrity campaigners who called for the prime minister's impeachment. He has called Tony Blair \"a war criminal\" and the US a \"country run by a bunch of criminals... with Tony Blair as a hired Christian thug\". But Pinter had a crumb of comfort for fans of his work. \"I think I've stopped writing plays now, but I haven't stopped writing poems,\" he said. In 2003, he published a volume of anti-war poetry about the conflict in Iraq."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
