Moore said current incumbent Peter Capaldi had \u201cbroken the mould\u201d but said she would never \u201cput a bar\u201d on its future direction. Doctor Who returned for its new series two weeks ago with 4.6 million viewers, the lowest audience for a launch show since its new incarnation in 2005. It dipped further last Saturday to 3.7 million viewers, up against Wales\u2019 Rugby World Cup win over England on ITV. However, the launch programme added another 2 million viewers \u2013 nearly 50% of its total audience, in the consolidated figures, which include people who recorded it and watched it in the following seven days, up to 6.5 million. It has also had 1.5 million requests to watch it on the iPlayer to date. Moore told Radio Times: \u201cPeter Capaldi is a fantastic Doctor, and he\u2019s broken the mould. But I\u2019d never put a bar on that. The great thing about Doctor Who is that anything is possible.\u201d Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat said earlier this year: \u201cIt\u2019s not an impossibility to have a lady Doctor. It is not a lock either. There is no guarantee. \u201cI wish sometimes that the politics of that would take a backseat and we\u2019d just talk about the art, because it\u2019s not really about that. It\u2019s just about \u2018would it work?\u2019 \u201cThe day it will work is when somebody says, \u2018That person would be amazing,\u2019 and the most conservative, most traditional member of the audience says, \u2018Oh God, yes. I would hate the idea of a lady Doctor, but that one would be great.\u2019\u201d Elsewhere in the interview, Moore rejected criticism of BBC1\u2019s The Voice \u2013 described by former BBC chairman Michael Grade as a \u201cclone\u201d of other talent shows \u2013 and defended the BBC\u2019s treatment of Tom Jones after he was dropped from the show. \u201cUnless you are saying that the BBC can\u2019t do talent shows at all, the way The Voice is made \u2013 its warmth and tone \u2013 is BBC in its nature. it is distinctive because of the way the BBC does it. And eight to 10 million people rock up to watch Strictly and The Voice, so I know we\u2019re getting it right,\u201d she said. She also defended the scheduling of BBC1\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing, after ITV said it was being used to \u201cclip the wings\u201d of The X Factor. \u201cWe\u2019re scheduling Strictly in the place we\u2019ve always scheduled it, and I think our audience expects it to be there at that time,\u201d said Moore. \u201cI think it\u2019s when the flagship entertainment show is expected to be shown on a Saturday night. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s had any [negative] effect on ITV\u2019s entertainment over the years. Knowing that the BBC is giving people an alternative is absolutely right.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
