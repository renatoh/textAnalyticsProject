Lehmann, 31, who has spent three seasons at Headingley, takes over after David Byas, stepped down on lifting the County Championship trophy last summer. \"I'll enjoy it, it's good fun and a good opportunity,\" said Lehmann. \"It's only a temporary post. If someone wants to take the job, a younger bloke can take it for four or five years, so I'll only do it for a year or two.\" Yorkshire's chief executive Chris Hassell gave him an immediate boost by dismissing reports that the disgruntled fast bowler Darren Gough was about to leave Headingley. Meanwhile, Australia denied New Zealand an astonishing victory in the first Test in Brisbane after the Kiwis had come within 10 runs of victory. After heavy rain during the previous three days two declarations spiced up the finale: New Zealand, set 284 to win at five an over, zeroed in on their target thanks to half-centuries from Mark Richardson and Stephen Fleming and a lightning contribution from Chris Cairns with 43 off 38 balls. But they lost momentum when Cairns was caught on the boundary by Ricky Ponting off Glenn McGrath and Australia held out for the draw. \u00b7 The Pakistan Cricket Board has asked the International Cricket Council to set up a special committee to deal with Shoaib Akhtar's suspect bowling action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
