A visit to Radiohead.com on Sunday offered viewers only a blank page, while the band\u2019s six-year-old Twitter feed was also empty, featuring only a message saying: \u201c@Radiohead hasn\u2019t tweeted yet.\u201d On Facebook, nearly 12 million users \u201clike\u201d a page with nothing on it. Brian Message, of the band\u2019s management company Courtyard Management, has previously said the new album, a follow-up to 2011\u2019s King of Limbs, would be released in June. But by 1 May, some wondered whether it could come sooner, perhaps via an unusual method of delivery. Some fans have recently received cards in the mail emblazoned with the band\u2019s bear logo and the words: \u201cSing the song of sixpence that goes \u2018Burn the witch\u2019.\u201d The band have a history of unveiling their music in unusual ways. Frontman Thom Yorke himself was among those handing out Radiohead-themed newspapers at record stores upon the release of King of Limbs. That album appeared within days of the band announcing it, heralded by a music video for the song Lotus Flower. The previous album, In Rainbows, was initially distributed online, and fans were invited to pay any price they chose in order to download the songs. And a more recent Thom Yorke project, Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes, was provided via the download service BitTorrent, with a song and a video available for free. As the band\u2019s ninth album approached, fans discussed how they might like to receive it, with suggestions ranging from a \u201csurprise webcast\u201d to \u201cdirectly into my vein\u201d. This article was amended on 1 May to reflect the pricing of Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
