All three were under total fire bans. The state experienced hot north-to-northwesterly winds, though a cooler, gusty south-westerly change was expected over the west and central districts from the late afternoon. From Tuesday, much milder conditions are forecast. Melbourne was expected to reach 38C by about 4pm on Monday before a sudden drop to 22C about 8pm. Mildura, in the state\u2019s north-west, was forecast to reach 43C before its cool change. Swan Hill, 200km southeast of Mildura, was expected to reach 42C. Three out-of-control bushfires were burning in East Gippsland in the early afternoon. Areas affected included Murrindal, Bruthen, Timbarra Settlement and Sunny Point. The Country Fire Authority [CFA] said on Monday morning there was no threat to residents in those areas, but by 2pm a bushfire near Ensay was travelling east and those in the Timbarra Settlement area were urged to leave immediately. \u201cThe fire has crossed Helipad Track,\u201d the CFA said in a warning issued on social media on Monday afternoon. \u201cThe Timbarra Road and the Bruthen-Buchan Road remains open at this stage. This may change subject to fire behaviour.\u201d Residents of Buchan, Buchan South and Sunny Point, near the Snowy River National Park, were told the same shortly after 1pm. Victoria\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said the hot, dry and windy conditions meant fires could start anywhere and without warning. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ensuring fire agency crews are well prepared, and it\u2019s also extremely important that the community is ready \u2026 Stay aware of your surroundings and if you\u2019re travelling or in unfamiliar places, make sure you are aware of the local risk,\u201d he said. Meanwhile firefighters in NSW were still trying to control 48 uncontained fires. Although cooler temperatures on Sunday helped their efforts they were bracing for temperatures above 40C in parts of the state by Tuesday. On Monday the NSW Rural Fire Service issued very high fire danger warnings for several areas including New England, the northern slopes and the southern ranges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
