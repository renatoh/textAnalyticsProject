It's not that they sound desperately like the Sisters of Mercy: gothy they may be, but Beastmilk are more metallic in tone, fond of big riffs and big riffs. It's more that singer Kvohst (actually a Brit called Mathew McNerney) shares Eldritch's impatient baritone, and a penchant for lyrics that combine gloominess and near-parodic silliness in equal measure (\"When the blood starts to rush, I've got a genocidal crush,\" he informs us on a song called, yes, Genocidal Crush, which you could easily imagine as a This Corrosion-era Sisters song). But then, you'd have to have a certain commitment to going way, way over the top to name your band Beastmilk, and to write songs called Death Reflects Us, Nuclear Winter and Surf the Apocalypse, wouldn't you? If Beastmilk's unstinting commitment to the dark side, and the never-ending armies of stormtrooper guitars, becomes a little tiring by the end of Climax, there's still fun to be had here. Unless, of course, they're deadly serious."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
