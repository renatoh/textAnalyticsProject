Jimi Hendrix took his last sleeping pills unencumbered by paternal reminders never to exceed the stated dose. History does not record any anxious relative cautioning Brian Jones to remember his flotation aids on the day he drowned in a swimming pool. No such privacy exists for Amy Winehouse, whose life, marred by drink and drugs, has been dissected by her family on a BBC radio phone-in programme last week. Giles Civil, the stepfather of her new husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, reportedly speculated that, if one partner died through substance abuse, the other might commit suicide. Amy's father, Mitch, rang in to criticise the Civils, while the soul singer's mother, who stayed out of this spat, had previously told a newspaper of her daughter's premonition of an early death. 'It's almost as though she's created her own ending,' she said. 'She's on a path of self-mutilation.' Once, the media had to dig out domestic nemesis by stealth and shop-a-star hotlines. Now, a hybrid of Greek tragedy and Holby City is open to all. Here's Amy tramping the streets in bloodstained ballet pumps, fresh from an overdose and rehab, with slugs of black eyeliner melting down her tear-streaked face. There's her husband with his cheek gouged open. This is a story of the grim banality of fame. The ghoulish used to watch public hangings or the inmates of Bedlam. Now they can scrutinise Pete Doherty, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton. This pantheon of misery makes people forget that the characteristic behaviour of the rock star is not to self-destruct. It is to get a knighthood, some Turner watercolours, a home gym and a lifespan exceeding that of a vegan bank manager. So why, suddenly, should so many famous young people, chiefly women, be falling apart? Obviously, fame is part of the problem, but what distinguishes these girls is the ordinariness of their downfalls. The paparazzi who stalk Winehouse outside the Hawley Arms gastropub will have to step over other aspiring 'Camden caners', drunk and showing their knickers in the gutter, in order to pursue their prey. The implosion of young female stars coincides with what is happening on the streets, on both sides of the Atlantic. In the UK, the British Medical Association revealed last week that almost one in 10 children suffers from 'severe' psychological problems. Last week, it was reported that 4,209 teenage girls were admitted to A&amp;E after getting drunk in 2005-06, compared with 2,916 four years earlier. More than 4,500 boys and girls aged 14 or under were treated in hospital for self-harm last yearand increasing numbers of schoolgirls are contemplating suicide. Despite phobia over child safety, British youngsters are at the bottom of international ratings for wellbeing. Though this unhappiness has been blamed on more or less reasonable factors ranging from lack of Omega-3 fatty acids to poverty, one cause is invariably cited. According to a range of experts, celebrity culture must be culpable. For anorexia, blame stick-thin models and unattainable images of perfection. For underachievement, blame Big Brother, with its hollow promises of instant fame, no GCSEs or knowledge of Shakespeare required. It seems much more plausible that celebrities are the victims rather than the agents of social problems. I have seen arms slashed like Amy Winehouse's, bodies as emaciated by drugs and minds as tortured as hers in the cells of Holloway prison. You can argue, fairly, that Winehouse can at least buy herself a cure, but addiction is a social leveller. Far from being an icon, she seems just one more casualty. Her influence on other young women is strictly limited. They like her for her wonderful voice and because iconoclastic stars living on the edge are more lustrous than dull ones living in Sevenoaks. No doubt they are drawn, as prurient adults are, to the macabre spectacle of an exhibitionist living out the darkest fantasies of teenage angst. But her admirers are selective, too. Winehouse fans do not want full-body tattoos, Marge Simpson beehives in squid-ink black or an early grave. They see a little of themselves in her and they want her to have a hopeful future, too. Keira Knightley, the other star of the moment for her role in Atonement, is more beautiful than Winehouse, almost as thin and very rich. She is also a Londoner from a normal background, but somehow she fails to inspire the adulation of her generation. That is partly because music is a mesmeric subculture and film is not. But Knightley also has the distance of a Hollywood diva, while Winehouse's tears and self-doubt are every teenager's story. Celebrity sets her apart, of course. But the spectacle of her extended family ransacking her unravelling world does not suggest that she has been unhinged by too many limousines and Gucci shoes. This is a private disaster, different from a thousand other breakdowns only in its exposure. Like many of her fellow stars, Winehouse is not a corrupter of the public realm: she is its product and reflection. It is a consoling myth that Britain would be merging with Utopia if only we could dispense with trash television and Wags peddling dubious morality and own-brand perfume. Precocity and consumerism, trends with complex social roots, are mistakenly brushed off as the designer accessories of a loathsome celebrity culture. David Cameron holds the music industry responsible for his 'broken society', but Britain needs no help from rappers to turn out unhappy young people. While demanding lives and complex families have made most teenagers more robust, contented and mature than their predecessors, a minority is more troubled. Some are crushed by too much expectation, others by too little. Childhood is imbued with external demons - the paedophile, the abductor, the celebrity - when, as ever, the most powerful influences are close to home. The Winehouse family feud, amplified for worldwide consumption, is an echo of the leading example of the nationalisation of private grief. Last week, the Diana saga reached an end. Already there's a sequel. Bickering inlaws, eating disorders, dead-end partners, a media in love with celebrity dysfunction and a heroine with whom the unhappy can identify. The Winehouse and the Windsor chronicles have all that in common, with the obvious difference that Amy is still alive. Though lacking the towering sentimentality of the Diana epic, her story can still be milked for more tearful plotlines than you could shake a teddy bear at. 'Kiss of Death' reads a headline over a picture of Winehouse embracing her husband on a Caribbean beach. This is not a get well card issued on behalf of a nation that nurtures all its talent. It is the cry of a society that eats its young. mary.riddell@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
