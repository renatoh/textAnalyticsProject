Because he thinks it\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d legislation. The Morrison government risks a humiliating defeat when parliament resumes next week, with Labor, the Greens and most of the crossbench on track to pass Kerryn Phelp\u2019s medical evacuation bill for refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. If the Coalition loses the vote, it will be the first time since 1929 a sitting government lost a substantive legislative vote on the floor. When the Stanley Bruce government lost that vote, Bruce called an election the next day. Morrison told Sky News he would not be repeating history. \u201cIf we lose that vote next week, so be it. We won\u2019t be going off to the polls,\u201d he said on Tuesday night. \u201cThe election is in May. I will simply ignore it and we\u2019ll get on with the business. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to be howled down by the Labor party who want to dismantle a border protection system I had a key hand in building.\u201d Morrison was also scathing about the legislation itself. \u201cThis is a stupid bill. It\u2019s written by people who haven\u2019t got the faintest idea how this works,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do and I am so appalled that the Labor party would even play this sort of political game to get a cheap vote in the House next week. \u201cI will stay on the side of strong border protection and he [Bill Shorten] can take a running jump \u2026 We will vote it down, and if that means that the bill goes down, it will be on Bill Shorten\u2019s head. Now Bill Shortens wants [you] to blame the crossbenchers for this, no no, Bill, it\u2019s all on your head.\u201d Morrison told reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday that the bill would also stop the government from rejecting medical transfers to asylum seekers with criminal histories, despite supporters of the bill insisting these protections would remain in place. \u201cThey may be a paedophile, they may be a rapist, they may be a murderer, and this bill will mean that we would just have to take them,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis is what will happen if Bill Shorten does not put national security ahead of his own political opportunism.\u201d Shorten responded by saying the prime minister should be \u201cashamed of himself\u201d. \u201cThe fact of the matter is people who have done those crimes don\u2019t get the refugee status unless the government\u2019s missed them when they\u2019ve assessed them as refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that somehow because you\u2019re a Liberal you dislike those crimes more than if you\u2019re someone else, I just get sick of that moral superiority and finger pointing.\u201d When defeat became a real threat on the final sitting day last year, Morrison called a snap press conference, where he vowed to \u201cfight them\u201d on this. In an emotional display, he vowed to do \u201ceverything in my power to ensure these changes never see the light of day\u201d. The government, with the help of Cory Bernardi, starved off defeat on the bill last year, by filibustering the bill in the Senate, delaying its return to the House until it was too late to call a vote. But Labor has said it won\u2019t be backing away and, while Cathy McGowan has indicated she will make up her mind when the bill comes before the House, her crossbench colleagues said they had seen no indication the Indi MP was backing away from supporting it. The Phelps bill would see the relevant minister have to justify to the parliament why they have rejected a request for an asylum seeker or refugee to be treated in Australia if two independent doctors judge they need to be moved. An independent health advice panel would review any cases rejected by the minister. But the Morrison government argues the final decision should remain with the minister and, attempting to head off a potential defeat next week, offered a medical panel to give non-binding feedback on transfers. Phelps rejected that, and Labor recommitted its support to the crossbench bill on Tuesday, arguing medical transfers were already occurring and the minister could reject applications for transfers on security grounds. The Morrison government lost its majority in the House when Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s retirement from politics ended with the Liberal party losing the Wentworth byelection to independent Phelps, in a historic swing. Julia Banks\u2019 defection to the crossbench left the government with 72 MPs, leaving it four votes short of an absolute majority. Labor, with 69 MPs, is also short, but a simple majority of 75 can pass a bill. In an essay on the Australian Public Law blog, Prof Anne Twomey has argued 75 MPs would be enough to change standing orders, which require an absolute majority to bring private members\u2019 bills to vote.
