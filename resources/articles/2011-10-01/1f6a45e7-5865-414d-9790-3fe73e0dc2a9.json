McClaren left the City Ground after only 111 days as manager, questioning whether the club matched his own ambition on the back of a disappointing start to the season. Clark, who has taken over as chairman at Forest following Nigel Doughty's decision to stand down, is in the process of finalising a shortlist for the managerial vacancy, with an appointment expected next week. Steve Cotterill, the Portsmouth manager, remains in the running and Gary Mills, the former Forest player who is in charge of York City, is also believed to be under consideration. \"Whoever gets the job here, before he accepts it, will be made aware of all the circumstances of what he has, what he is expected to do and what he will be able to do and what he won't be able to do,\" Clark said, alluding to some of the difficulties at Forest in recent years. \"If he is not prepared to accept that, then he won't get the job and we will move on to someone else. The last thing we want to do is bring someone in here on a load of false promises. It is perfectly possible to progress under that kind of regime.\" Clark, who previously played and managed at the City Ground, has been wading through the list of applicants and he has made it clear that, because of Forest's need to be prudent, the new manager must have experience of \"working on a budget\" and ideally be familiar with the Championship. \"I have seen the list of applicants and half drawn up a shortlist,\" said Clark. \"No one is within touching distance of the job. I will be involved in the procedure. The shortlist will not differ much from the one that had originally been drawn up. You would be amazed at some of the names who have applied \u2013 it is staggering. I appreciate so many high-calibre people applying and it shows the calibre of this club. \"Whoever gets the job will not be bringing in five people and sacking five of our people. That won't happen. It will help if we can get someone who has experience of working on a budget. It would be no good bringing in a manager whose strength is in the transfer market, wheeling and dealing; that is not going to be the case. If he has experience at this level, that would make him a better prospect.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
