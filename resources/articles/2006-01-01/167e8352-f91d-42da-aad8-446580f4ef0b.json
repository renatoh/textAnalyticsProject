That effectively abandons the government's initial position from just last year of a partial ban depending on whether the pub served food. After rebel MPs, headed by the Labour chair of the health select committee, Keith Barron, last night tabled an amendment to the health bill, Downing Street today announced it would allow all Labour MPs, including minsters, a free vote on the issue. Although some libertarian Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs are likely to vote against a full ban, that concession and the strength of feeling on Labour benches, means a total ban is now almost inevitable. The Scottish parliament has already legislated for its own complete ban, following the example of Ireland, and the health bill allows for the Welsh assembly to decide for itself whether or not to implement the ban in Wales - which it is certain to do. But after the prime minister, Tony Blair, signalled at the weekend in an Observer interview that smoking was \"not a core issue\" in terms of principle, it was always likely Number 10 would allow a free vote, rather than force a confrontation when other more contentious items - such as the education bill - are on the horizon. A major cabinet row, principally between Patricia Hewitt and John Reid, broke out last year over the smoking ban, with Mr Reid's position prevailing. That meant that, although the smoking ban would include all public enclosed spaces, pubs which served prepared food would be exempt. Ms Hewitt later made it clear that a review of the legislation in two years' time was likely to entail a full ban. The prime minister's official spokesman announced the backtrack today, but said the PM would not be disclosing in advance if, or how, he would vote when MPs debate the issue next month. Earlier today, parliament's joint committee on human rights said the exemption could also be incompatible with human rights legislation because it discriminated against staff in different areas. Critics also argued that partial ban would further exacerbate health problems between rich and poor, with working-class, saloon-style bars continuing to allow smoking, whilst upmarket gastropubs or family-orientated public houses banned it. Last year the health select committee branded a partial ban as \"unfair, unjust, inefficient and unworkable\". The government's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, revealed last year he had considered quitting over the watering down of the ban. The 10 MPs who have tabled the amendment come from all three main parties, as well as the independent GP MP, Dr Richard Taylor. The cross-party amendment will now be considered in a couple of weeks when it returns for its report stage in the Commons. Last month, 64 Labour MPs signed a motion calling for a free vote. Yesterday a Guardian survey of Labour backbenchers found almost 70% wanted a total ban. The government has agreed to stop smoking in all pubs and clubs in Northern Ireland, and the Scottish Executive has ordered a ban. The health bill gives the Welsh assembly the right to decide for itself whether to implement a ban it has already twice approved in principle. The shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, welcomed the government's U-turn. He said: \"We are delighted the government has followed the Conservative party's lead and allowed its MPs a free vote on smoking in public places. \"We now look forward to debating this issue freely in parliament, and to a workable, fair and effective outcome which protects children, staff and the public from the clear dangers of second-hand tobacco smoke.\" Smokers' lobby group Forest attacked the \"spineless and unprincipled\" decision and said it still believed a partial ban was possible. Director Simon Clark said: \"The prime minister has surrendered to a group of anti-smoking fanatics, and Downing Street has shamelessly gone back on its commitment to ensure that some pubs and clubs are exempt from a smoking ban. Peter Cardy, of Macmillan Cancer Relief, said: \"This is an important step forward but a complete smoking ban in England is still far from certain.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
