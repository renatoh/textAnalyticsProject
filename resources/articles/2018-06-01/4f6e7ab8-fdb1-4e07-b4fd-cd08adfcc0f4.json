Ardern will take six weeks\u2019 leave after giving birth and when she returns to work her partner, Clarke Gayford, will become a stay-at-home-dad. Here, New Zealand women with babies due in the same month discuss what it means to have a pregnant prime minister, and how they will balance parenthood, work and a severe lack of sleep. \u2018She is phenomenal\u2019 Jaime Faulkner, 36, lives in the rural town of Kawakawa in the Bay of Islands. Married for 12 years to Nathan, a dairy farmer, Faulkner is expecting her fourth child \u2013 a girl \u2013 on 1 June. Together, the couple have five children. Nathan will not take any leave. \u201cWhen I heard the news, I wondered if Jacinda and I were due around the same time. My initial response was \u2018wow, I wonder if we went to the same party.\u2019 I was so happy for her, she is a phenomenal woman and to do what she does \u2013 she runs the country. All I do is run a little tribe. I am excited for her to be a mum and to experience that. I mean it does my head in every now and then, and you wish you could just have that one day to just be you, but you\u2019d never change what you have once you\u2019ve got it. I have three jobs. I am a relief teacher at the local high school, waitress at a hotel and also a bartender at a local RSA [Returned and Services\u2019 Association]. I work about 60-plus hours a week. At home, my eldest is about to turn 16, then 15, then 13, then 12, then 7. I usually get home at midnight, then have a bit of a break and get to bed. Then it\u2019s rinse, lather and repeat really. [Our baby] was a complete surprise. Our last two pregnancies were surprises, too, because I was on contraceptive for both. And it was an absolute shock. It did change a lot of plans that we had, but it is a blessing in disguise, and probably what I need to slow me down a bit in terms of work and employment. Once we found out, it was a matter of making it work. Basically with my mindset it is as easy or as hard as you make it. [Our baby] will be delivered by two women I went to high school with, and I trust them completely. We will have some traditional M\u0101ori practices when baby is born. Her umbilical cord will be tied using plaited natural fibre from a flax bush. And her umbilical cord will be put with a piece of pounamu, a greenstone. And a karakia [M\u0101ori prayer]. I didn\u2019t do this with the other children, it wasn\u2019t really an option. The midwives I have now, they are offering it more these days. It is becoming more of a common practice. Women have been doing it [juggling] for years and years and years. But they\u2019ve never been in a position where they\u2019ve been made an example of before. I was talking to a young girl in town, and she said how can you work three jobs and be eight months pregnant and look after all your kids? Jacinda\u2019s pregnancy will encourage people and say to them \u2018give it a go, it\u2019s not as hard as you think it is\u2019.\u201d \u2018I get two days paid leave\u2019 Rosie Whitley-Harford, 27, and husband Adam Harford,31, own their own home in the provincial east coast town of Gisborne, in the North Island. Adam is a school teacher and Rosie is a qualified early childhood educator. They are expecting their first child on 10 June. Rosie: \u201cWe found out I was pregnant the day after I resigned. So that made it quite difficult. I was quite unwell for the first trimester, too, and then it dwindled off. It definitely wasn\u2019t easy at the start. Adam would have to get up in the morning and do me Marmite on toast before I would even get out of bed.\u201d Adam: \u201cYeah had to, because even if she put her feet on the ground before she got toast in her she\u2019d have a bad day.\u201d Rosie: \u201cWe know how important it is to have that one person at home. The first three years are so important. So we have decided to have me stay home, and maybe in a year\u2019s time we can talk about me going back to work, or maybe I won\u2019t want to.\u201d Adam: \u201cYeah, we have kind of set ourselves up to function off my sole income. So if Rosie needs to stay home, if we want her to stay home, then she can. We know we\u2019re not going to get to go out to dinner every weekend, but that\u2019s the life we\u2019ve set up because that\u2019s more important to us.\u201d Rosie: \u201cLots of people say after that paid parental leave stops, that\u2019s when you realise how tight things can be.\u201d Adam: \u201cWe are learning to live within our means. Our type of car is not exactly luxurious. We eat plain meals. We don\u2019t get the best cuts of steak. We live pretty Kiwi I suppose.\u201d Rosie: \u201cYeah, we\u2019re pretty modest.\u201d Adam: \u201cAccording to my collective agreement I get two days paid leave. I think if things go smoothly, a safe birth, we are hoping just for a week off eh?\u201d Rosie: \u201cYeah. I think love is a really big thing. That is our biggest thing, to portray love and kindness, so that is nurtured in the child.\u201d I was really happy for her [Jacinda]. I thought it was so amazing she could show women in this country that you can be a mum, and you can still do all the other things that make you happy. And a lot of people were quick to judge it, but at the end of the day she still has to live her life. She\u2019s not just the prime minister.\u201d Adam: \u201cI wasn\u2019t really concerned with any of the political nonsense or her being able to carry her role out, I was just happy for her as a person. I\u2019m jealous as [of Clarke]. In the last few years I have thought it would be pretty awesome to be a stay-at-home dad. There\u2019s kind of two things that count me out, the earning factor, and also Rosie is kind of the child whisperer. \u2018We are privileged to have a prime minister who is going to know what it\u2019s like\u2019 Autumn Falk, a medical herbalist, and Jenni Werth, a former occupational therapist, own a medicinal tea business and live in Katikati, Bay of Plenty. They have a tea bar in a caravan which they take to markets and festivals. Autumn: \u201cIt has been a really long process. It was early on in our relationship that we decided we wanted to have children.\u201d Jenni: \u201cAbout six years ago we met the father who is a really good friend of ours. And pretty much asked him straightaway and he was like \u2018yeah, no problem\u2019. Then, when it came down to it, I think it was a bit more serious thought involved.\u201d Autumn: \u201cHe will be involved in kind of an uncle position. Obviously, the child will know this is their father, yeah. He will definitely have involvement and come and go I guess.\u201d Jenni: \u201cHe won\u2019t have any decision-making rights around raising the baby, but he will definitely be involved.\u201d Jenni: \u201cI will be full-time mothering for the first year, then we will see how it goes, I have always wanted to parent, and Autumn is very content with going to work and providing. She is really happy doing that and I am happy being on the land and working in the gardens and being at home.\u201d Autumn: \u201cA lot of people speak to us and say \u2018oh your baby is also due in June!\u2019. Just like the prime minister\u2019s one.\u201d Jenni: \u201cWe haven\u2019t followed her pregnancy to the extreme. I am more intrigued with how much of a difference it might make in her understanding of what it\u2019s like to be a working mum \u2013 and she\u2019s obviously at one extreme of the spectrum. I think we are really privileged in New Zealand to have a prime minister who is going to know what that\u2019s like. Because a lot of the decisions that get made in this country are made by people who have no idea what it\u2019s like to be in that situation, and to be outside of a situation and make decisions for a population \u2026 it\u2019s a big ask. Autumn: \u201cI find this quite an extraordinary situation. She is a woman, there are not many countries with leading women in power, and she is young enough to be able to have a child. It is pretty impressive overall.\u201d Jenni: \u201cI think this will give women a boost, of really believing anything is possible. I really hope for her sake she doesn\u2019t get over-scrutinised with how she manages. But I think it is going to inspire a lot of women.\u201d Jenni: \u201cI am worried about the lack of sleep.\u201d Autumn: \u201cThe question I am always asking myself is; is it [lack of sleep] really as bad as everyone says?\u201d Jenni: \u201cIt is probably way worse than everyone says.\u201d \u2018Lengthening paid parental leave would help\u2019 Robin Burnell, 27, a franchise support worker for a cafe chain and her husband, Sam, 28, a plumber, live in Christchurch and are expecting their first child on 30 June. Robin: \u201cI grew up really wanting a family. It was really important for both of us. I am just very clucky, very keen on children, very keen on babies. Change is always challenging, I think. And my normal becoming new is a little bit daunting. But I am really excited, too. A lot of people have talked about not realising how much love you could have for a baby until they are there. I plan to do six months off. And Sam would love a day at home with the baby as well.\u201d Sam: \u201cI would love to stay home. But it is all money related. If I can stay home I really want to.\u201d Robin: \u201cI have no idea how she [Jacinda] does what she does, and not look like she is struggling. I don\u2019t think she is setting the bar too high, because every pregnancy is different. I just think she is very brave and confident. I think it would be awesome if the government reviewed how much paid parental leave is available to new parents. I know New Zealand is quite low down compared to other countries, which is hard when they don\u2019t provide paid childcare until minimum two years old and most cases three years old. It is quite a strain. I think we have a lot of good things in New Zealand, but lengthening paid parental leave would definitely help.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
