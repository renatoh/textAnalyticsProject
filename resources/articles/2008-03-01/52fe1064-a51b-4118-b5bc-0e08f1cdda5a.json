The Super League's bottom club have called a press conference for Monday morning to make a major announcement amid speculation that they have persuaded Chambers to try his hand at rugby league. No-one was available for comment at Castleford but Damion Silk, Chambers' spokesman, confirmed tonight that the athlete will be going to Castleford to have a look at the club and to discuss the possibility of a rugby league career. However, Silk stressed that it is just a visit and does not mean that Chambers will be committing himself to the Super League club. The 29-year-old, a European gold medalist in 2002, made an abortive move into American football after retiring from athletics in the wake of his two-year drugs ban. Chambers was banned after testing positive for the designer steroid THG but recently made a controversial comeback to the track. He was thought to be set to launch a legal appeal against the British Olympic Association's lifetime ban in a bid to take part at the Beijing Games. Chambers would not be the first high-profile athlete to turn to the 13-man rugby code - sprinter Berwyn Jones had a stint with Wakefield Trinity in the 1960s. Castleford have won just one of their opening eight matches since their return to Super League and have the smallest squad in the top flight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
