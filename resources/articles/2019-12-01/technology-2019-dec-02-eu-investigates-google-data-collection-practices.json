During the past week, the competition commission has sent out questionnaires to companies that work with Google asking them about the agreements they have made to share data with the search firm. The regulator said: \u201cThe commission has sent out questionnaires as part of a preliminary investigation into Google\u2019s practices relating to Google\u2019s collection and use of data. The preliminary investigation is ongoing.\u201d Foo Yun Chee, reporting for Reuters, said the questionnaires for the latest investigation showed that the EU\u2019s focus was on \u201cdata related to local search services, online advertising, online ad targeting services, login services, web browsers and others\u201d. The new investigation suggests that the EU is not yet done with its scrutiny of Google, which has already resulted in more than \u20ac8bn (\u00a36.8bn) of fines. A 2017 investigation into Google Shopping resulted in a fine of \u20ac2.4bn; in 2018, anticompetitive practices involving Google\u2019s Android smartphone operating system were the basis of a \u20ac4.3bn fine; and those were followed in 2019 with a \u20ac1.5bn fine over advertising violations. In the latter violations, the competition commission has placed increasing emphasis on the contracts Google has signed with third parties \u2013 restrictions which are not traditionally a part of antitrust enforcement, but which are widely seen as crucial to how companies such as Google maintain their lead. In the Android case, for example, Google was criticised for requiring handset manufacturers to agree to terms that banned them from building phones using non-Google versions of Android. Tech analyst Ben Thompson argues that such contractual restrictions are increasingly common. \u201cThis is an area ripe for enhanced antitrust enforcement,\u201d Thompson wrote in March. \u201cThese large tech companies have enough advantages, most of them earned through delivering what customers want, and abetted by the fundamental nature of zero marginal costs. Seeking to augment those advantages through contracts that suppliers can\u2019t say \u2018no\u2019 to should be viewed with extreme skepticism.\u201d UK acquisition investigated As well as the EU investigation, Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority on Monday announced its own inquiry into Google, focusing on the company\u2019s acquisition of UK data science startup Looker. In a statement, the CMA said it \u201cis considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.\u201d The acquisition, announced in June, saw Google spending more than \u00a32bn on the company, intended to improve the analytics services Google provides customers of its cloud platform."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
