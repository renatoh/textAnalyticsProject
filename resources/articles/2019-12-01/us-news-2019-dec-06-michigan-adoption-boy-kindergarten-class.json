Each one of them held up a pink or red paper heart, some of them barely able to see above the wooden barrier dividing the courtroom. \u201cThere is not a dry eye in Judge Patricia Gardner\u2019s courtroom,\u201d Kent county, Michigan, posted on its Facebook page on Thursday as Michael and 36 other children were officially adopted. Michael became a foster child to Andrea Melvin and Dave Eaton a year ago, according to local news station Woodtv.com, before formally being adopted by them this week. \u201cI understand we are joined by Michael\u2019s kindergarten classroom and teacher,\u201d Judge Gardner of the 17th circuit court family division, festively wearing a necklace of Christmas ornaments, said as she began National Adoption Day proceedings in Michigan. Even she shed a few tears as she welcomed all 37 children into her courthouse. Michael took a seat with a stuffed animal in his arms, later joining the judge in her chair. He swiveled back and forth, when it was his turn. He banged the judge\u2019s gavel, all the while smiling, as his classmates looked on. Later, his class posed with him, with all of their pink and red hearts waving at the camera. His kindergarten teacher told reporters Michael\u2019s classmates wanted to be there for him on his special day, saying: \u201cWe rise when we support others.\u201d \u201cI love my mommy!\u201d Michael interrupted his mother as she did an interview after he became an official part of the family. He told his parents earlier he wanted what he called his \u201cother family\u201d, his classmates and teacher, to be there, too, on his big day. His mother had the same to say about Michael, adding to the love in the courtroom that day, \u201cHe\u2019s just so full of energy and so full of love, it\u2019s just been great for everybody. \u201cWe asked him and he said \u2018You know, the class is kind of my family.\u2019 And he wanted them to be there,\u201d Eaton told Woodtv.com. Several children stood up to tell the court, \u201cI love Michael\u201d or \u201cMichael\u2019s my best friend,\u201d his father added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
