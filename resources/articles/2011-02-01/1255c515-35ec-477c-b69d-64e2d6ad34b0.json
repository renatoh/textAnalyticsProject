She stands up abruptly, crosses the room, eyes ablaze, and reaches for a revolver. Everyone ducks. We are in a rehearsal room, and this is a scene from David Hare's play Plenty, in which Morahan plays the character of Susan Traherne: an incendiary, sometimes explosive heroine who is memorablydescribed by one character as \"a psychiatric cabaret\". Morahan laughs when we sit down afterwards. \"It's rather shocking, isn't it? She refuses to follow convention. Earlier in the play she says that she has a fear of literally blowing men out of the room. She's aware the world she's inhabiting is too small.\" Plenty shows Morahan's character aiding the French Resistance during the second world war, and then becoming stranded in the stultifying realities of peacetime. She gets a dead-end advertising job, has affairs, attempts to conceive a child with a near-stranger \u2013 only to find herself locked away in a psychiatric institution, and marrying a plodding, reliable civil servant. If at times she seems to be experiencing post-traumatic stress, elsewhere her self-destruction seems entirely sane: symbolic of the generation of women who were forced to abandon their ambitions postwar. One scene begins at a diplomatic drinks party on the eve of the Suez crisis; it ends with Susan crumpling under the weight of her memories. \"Because of the situation, she's been told not to mention anything,\" says Morahan. \"But she's fighting it all the time. The big question in the play is: does she go mad? There's a telling line in the script where she says she likes to lose control. In some ways, she's just telling it like it is.\" Morahan has often played characters that are close to the edge. In Rupert Goold's revival of JB Priestley's Time and the Conways at the National in 2009, she was Kay, a woman whose dreams unravel before our eyes. In Katie Mitchell's searing 2004 version of Euripides's Iphigenia at Aulis, she played the title role, a 15-year-old girl who is dragged off to be sacrificed. Another Mitchell production, 2006's The Seagull, saw her as Nina, the aspiring actor who falls for the wrong man and ends the play broken and abandoned. Sipping a mug of green tea, Morahan looks very little like these doomed heroines, but nonetheless possesses a quizzical energy that hints at her intensity on stage. What is it, I wonder, that attracts her to playing women on the verge of a nervous breakdown? Her eyes widen. \"Gosh, really? I'm trying to think which parts. But you're right, there have been some highly strung people. I remember Rupert [Goold] saying about my character in Time and the Conways that it's not like she's like this all the time, it's just we've caught her on a really, really bad day. I guess it's just exploring what someone has got bubbling underneath.\" She holds the thought. \"Maybe it sometimes comes out too much.\" Not many would agree about that: Morahan, 32, is one of the most sought-after young actors around. As Elinor in Andrew Davies's BBC adaptation of Sense and Sensibility (2008), she gave what one critic called \"as good a piece of acting as you are likely to see\", and was an impetuous presence in Stoppard's The Real Thing at the Old Vic last year. But it is in edgier, experimental drama that she has made her reputation: Morahan has appeared in no fewer than four Katie Mitchell productions, most recently a 2008 adaptation of Dostoevsky's The Idiot that put the novel's psychological intensity on unflinching display. \"Working with Katie opened up my head,\" she explains. \"What's exciting about theatre is observing human behaviour. You're constantly making judgments about body language, the physical, the emotional, the intellectual. It's fascinating to find out what the cocktail is.\" Plenty depicts postwar, post-imperial Britain as a world of drab compromises and frustrated desires. Although initially dismissed by the critics, it was hailed as a masterpiece after being revived in New York in 1982, before being filmed with Meryl Streep in the title role. It's now programmed at Sheffield's Crucible as part of a major retrospective of the playwright's work. Morahan has her own history with the play. Her father, Christopher, is a theatre and TV director who was running the Lyttelton theatre when Plenty first opened there, in 1978; Morahan is just a few months younger than the play. \"He was thrilled when he heard I was doing it,\" she says. In fact, she got her first TV job courtesy of her father, in a 1996 drama he directed called The Peacock Spring; her mother is Anna Carteret, best-known for her lead role in the 1980s BBC police series Juliet Bravo. She grew up surrounded by theatre folk and admits, with mild embarrassment, that Laurence Olivier once helped her with her maths. \"He was a great friend of my parents, and I was sent to do my homework while all these luvvies were out partying on the lawn. He came in and sat with me. A brief encounter.\" Despite her immersion in theatre, Morahan seems to have a healthily unobsessive approach to her career. She has been engaged to her partner, actor Blake Ritson, for six years (\"we're very disorganised\") and is currently deciding what work to do next. More TV is in the offing, as is radio. But she admits that she might just need a break. \"Parts like this are emotionally draining. It's about variety. I want to use some other muscles.\" So everything isn't as intense in her own life as it is on stage? She unleashes a burst of laughter. \"God, no. I'm not like those strange, nervous-breakdown people at all. Quite sane, really.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
