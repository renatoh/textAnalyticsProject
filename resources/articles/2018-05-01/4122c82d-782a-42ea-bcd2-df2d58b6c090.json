Angus Sinclair said that Bercow had shouted at him, undermined him in front of other staff, swore and attempted to physically intimidate him, with a mobile phone smashed on the desk in front of him on one occasion. The former senior official told BBC Newsnight he was paid \u00a386,250 in 2010, after working for Bercow for one year, as part of a deal that required him to sign a non-disclosure agreement about the alleged behaviour. Sinclair, who spoke earlier this year about a culture of covering up bullying in the House of Commons, has now breached the terms of his agreement. \u201cI thought to myself, it\u2019s in the public interest to know why I left, yes, it breaks that non-disclosure agreement, but it\u2019s the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was bullying.\u201d Bercow has denied the claim. A spokesman for his office said: \u201cMr Speaker strenuously denies that there is any substance to any of these allegations. He has a superb team of dedicated, effective and long-serving staff \u2013 five of whom have worked for him very happily for a combined total of over 40 years.\u201d However, the latest allegation could prove damaging for Bercow as it comes at a time when the Commons is trying to get to grips with bullying and harassment on its estate. An independent inquiry into the bullying of House staff is under way and will report back in July. In a speech last week, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said: \u201cThere can be no hiding places, or cover-ups, for anyone abusing their power.\u201d Earlier this year, she published a report on plans to toughen up protections for staff. Complaints would spark a confidential inquiry by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, with a tougher range of sanctions for those found to have behaved inappropriately. The Guardian understands that almost 1,500 parliamentary staff will be brought under the umbrella of Westminster\u2019s new official complaints system for harassment and bullying for the first time this summer. Sinclair, who joined the House of Commons in 2005 as private secretary to fomer speaker Michael Martin, said that he was given compulsory early retirement after around a year of working for Bercow, who became speaker in 2009. A letter from the Director General of Resources made clear that the payment, part of his severance package, was explicitly dependent on his signing a non-disclosure agreement that would bar him from speaking to the media or raising a complaint. The \u00a386,250 lump sum \u2013 more than a year\u2019s pay \u2013 was unusual for a retiring staff member. He told the BBC: \u201cI can only think it was because of the detail of what had happened, you know, the bullying and the manner of my leaving ... What I\u2019d done was sign a cover-up and in a cynical way, I\u2019d been paid to do it, and that\u2019s not a good feeling.\u201d It follows claims that House managers were informed in 2011 that Kate Emms, Sinclair\u2019s successor in the role, had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after less than a year of working for Bercow. He has denied the claims. Sinclair told the programme that the speaker was prone to \u201cover the top\u201d anger: \u201cThe Speaker responded in a way that I can only say is a form of bullying. And that is to show anger ... I\u2019m not sure he was completely in control of it. The arms would wave around.\u201d He detailed one outburst: \u201cThere was a tirade of how I\u2019d let him down and it was the worst thing... There was a lot of bad language and suddenly his mobile phone, which he\u2019d been holding, was flung on the desk in front of me and broke into a lot of bits.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
