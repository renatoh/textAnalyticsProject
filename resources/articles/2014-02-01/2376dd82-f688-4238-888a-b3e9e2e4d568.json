What can we learn from Abduction? Mainly never to watch Abduction again. Hopefully next time I\u2019ll be liveblogging something less relentlessly dimwitted. If you\u2019ve been reading, thank you. If you haven\u2019t, you probably didn\u2019t miss much. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I\u2019m @StuHeritage. That\u2019s all now. Goodnight. The film ends with Taylor lautner putting the moves on Lily Collins. \u201cYou gotta admit\u201d he says, \u201cit was a pretty good first date\u201d. YOUR PARENTS DIED, YOU BASTARD. THEY DIED LESS THAN A DAY AGO. REMEMBER THAT, IN THE EXPLODING HOUSE? REMEMBER? YOU MONSTER. I hate this film. And Sigourney Weaver isn\u2019t dead either! It was all a trick! Or a lie or a joke or something. Just finish, film. Just FINISH. They\u2019re not really revealing who his dad is. We see his lips, then his hair, then his chin. It\u2019s like the Mystery Sportsman round on Question of Sport, only really long and awful. Oh, and Alfred Molina was a baddie all along. Oh yes! Taylor\u2019s dad shot the businessman. This means the film is over, right? Oh no! The businessman\u2019s got the gun. Oh yes! Taylor Lautner is parkouring through the stadium away from him. Oh no! Taylor\u2019s dad is ringing up again. Oh yes! He\u2019s going to shoot the businessman if Taylor can lead him into the right area. Oh no! This means the film\u2019s going to last a bit longer. Oh yes! Taylor Lautner\u2019s injured his leg really badly. Oh no! This means the film really is going to go on for longer than it needs to. Taylor and the businessman meet. Taylor\u2019s taped a gun under his seat. But before he can kill the businessman, the businessman lists all the children that his parents murdered. Oh, and you know all those dreams of abductions that Taylor said he had earlier in the film? They weren\u2019t dreams. They were MEMORIES of the businessman killing Taylor\u2019s mother. Who saw that comi... oh, you all did. Of course you did. Right. Now for the long overdue climax. For some reason, Taylor and Lily are at a baseball match for some reason. And his dad has phoned up. His real dad, the spy. His dad\u2019s all like \u2018Don\u2019t try and kill the businessman\u2019 and he\u2019s all like \u2018I\u2019m totally going to kill the businessman\u2019. Who\u2019ll win? I wish that there was even a molecule of my body that was the slightest bit invested in anything that\u2019s going on here. When I said that everyone in the CIA was dead, I didn\u2019t mean Alfred Molina. He\u2019s still alive, and he\u2019s ordered a hit on all the businessman\u2019s men. I think. I just want this film to end. Maybe it has ended. Maybe I\u2019m asleep. Maybe this is all a bad dream. Like Inception. Time seems to be going really slowly. That\u2019s a sign that I\u2019m being Inceptioned, isn\u2019t it? Someone find me a spinning top. Meanwhile, a sniper has killed everyone in the CIA. But Taylor Lautner has managed to escape. Perhaps not being able to speak lines convincingly or pull faces or look as if he understands what\u2019s going on has caused his ability to be better than the entire CIA to evolve. Alfred Molina has caught up with them both now, by the way. He\u2019s bought them both a hamburger. And now Taylor Lautner finally gets his answers. Alfred Molina tells him who his parents are (spies), who killed his adopted parents (spies) and why he was adopted by spies (it was all the spies). In fact, Alfred Molina answers all the questions except one - what on earth is he doing in this godawful bloody film? They\u2019re walking through the woods now. Probably the same woods as earlier. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m going to grow old and die liveblogging this film. Because of this hesitation, Taylor Lautner is able to kick the gunman to death and throw him out of the window. Meanwhile, Lily Collins has somehow managed to escape from being handcuffed to a wall and they\u2019ve run away. How exactly did she escape? I neither know or care, and I suspect the filmmakers knew that everyone would be bored and angry by this point so just stopped trying. The gunman who abducted Lily is now fighting Taylor. Taylor shuts himself inside a train cabin and hides behind the door. The gunman has no way to get to him. Except, oh wait, he\u2019s a gunman. He could just shoot through the door, kill Taylor Lautner and end the film. But oh no, that\u2019d be too easy, wouldn\u2019t it? Lily Collins gets some food from the buffet cart. But guess what? She\u2019s been... ABDUCTED. They\u2019re on a train to Nebraska now. I stopped caring why long ago. Also, they\u2019re kissing. Because nothing is more sexy than the VERY RECENT VIOLENT DEATH OF EVERYONE WHO YOU\u2019VE EVER BEEN CLOSE TO, is it? Taylor Lautner is a monster. You\u2019d better not be watching this, by the way. I\u2019m going to check the stats later on, and I\u2019d never be able to forgive myself if even one single person was watching Abduction because of this liveblog. There\u2019s still another hour of this film to go. If the liveblog goes quiet all of a sudden, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve gone to neck an entire bottle of bleach. Taylor\u2019s birth mother is dead, but they go and visit his grave. None of the people who want to kill him have any gunmen waiting at the graveyard, even though that was obviously the first place that he was going to go. These really are some very shoddy hitmen. I\u2019d be much better at killing Taylor Lautner than them. In the house\u2019s garage, Taylor finds a BMW. He grins. He just watched both his adopted parents and his therapist get murdered, and his house get blown up, and several different people are trying to kill him. And he still has time to grin at a car. Taylor Lautner is quite obviously a sociopath. I hope the films ends by revealing that he\u2019s responsible for all this death. OK, Lautner\u2019s in Virgina, at the address Sigourney Weaver gave him. He looks in one drawer, finds one envelope, looks inside and finds a picture of his birth mother who he recognises even though he\u2019s never actually met her. He is a really lucky boy. Who can\u2019t cry. Molina \u2013 who works for the CIA, by the way \u2013 is finally explaining what the hell is going on. The CIA is on the lookout for Martin Price, who is Taylor Lautner\u2019s real dad and has some sort of encrypted code. Also, the businessman from earlier is a baddie who wants to kill Taylor Lautner for the codes. Or, oh, SOMETHING. This is never going to make sense. I\u2019ve come to terms with that. It\u2019s like trying to liveblog a fever dream. A fever dream starring a mannequin of a porcupine. I don\u2019t know where he got it from, but Taylor just found a quilt. He\u2019s wrapped Lily up in it, which is admittedly quite chivalrous, but where did he get the quilt from? Did he just find it in the woods by the river? Because, if he did, a tramp almost definitely uses that quilt as a masturbatory aid. And, frankly, he\u2019s got enough going on without being chased around the woods by a tramp with nothing to jizz into. Even though in the last 20 minutes everyone he\u2019s ever loved has died in a horrible violent mess, Taylor Lautner is calmly leading Lily Collins down a river, because you can\u2019t be tracked in a river. Not even by a helicopter, apparently. Rivers are magic. This is what\u2019s happening now: Sigourney Weaver is driving Taylor Lautner away from Alfred Molina\u2019s men. She orders him to jump out of the car and run to Virginia. While this is going on, Lily Collins is doing some genuinely spectacular eyebrow acting. They jump out of the car. Sigourney Weaver blows up. This is the hardest liveblog I\u2019ve ever done. Now she\u2019s got rid of the balloons. We know this because she says \u201cI hate balloons\u201d. We know this because she\u2019s got rid of the balloons. This film has given me a nosebleed. The operator was Alfred Molina, by the way. He\u2019s either a goodie or a baddie. Sigourney Weaver is definitely a goodie, though. She finds Taylor and shields him to safety with the giant bunch of balloons that she\u2019s inexplicably brought with her. Taylor Lautner tries to call 911. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d an operator says. \u201cI\u2019m a bit shaken up\u201d he says. This isn\u2019t even deliberate understatement. Taylor Lautner is a monster who can\u2019t understand human emotion. NO SHE DOESN\u2019T. Because Taylor Lautner dropkicks the baddie. \u201cYOU KILLED MY PARENTS!\u201d he screams. \u201cThere\u2019s a bomb in the oven\u201d the baddie replies. Taylor Lautner looks in the oven. There is a bomb in it. The countdown has five seconds on it. In five seconds, Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins manage to register that there is a bomb in the oven, close the oven, leave the kitchen, walk through another room, leave the house through the back door and escape a bomb blast so enormous that his entire house are completely levelled. I hate that I\u2019m even writing this down. Some police officers come to the door. Except they\u2019re not police officers. They\u2019re employees of the businessman and they want to abduct Taylor. Maria Bello fights them off but ends up getting shot (which answers the question of what she\u2019s doing in this film; the answer is two day\u2019s work because she needed the money). Then his dad gets shot. And then Lily Collins gets abducted. PLOT UPDATE: Taylor\u2019s parents are not his real parents. Also, Taylor Lautner is not a convincing crier. Also what the hell is Maria Bello doing in this? His mother finds Taylor in his room, looking at all the pictures of him from the missing persons website. He\u2019s sad. We know this because he\u2019s crying. Or at least he\u2019s trying to cry. It\u2019s just as likely that he popped a fat gland in his eye while attempting to stifle a fart. Returning home, Taylor Lautner finds his dad hitting a lawnmower with a hammer. For absolutely no reason. The missing persons website they were looking at connects to a server room. There\u2019s a techie guy in the server room. The man calls a businessman. \u201cYou said to call you if the site ever got a hit\u201d he says. Which means that this man was solely employed exclusively to call a businessman on the precise off-chance that a single website ever got a single hit. Because that person, apparently, was always going to be Taylor Lautner. He was employed to tell a man when Taylor Lautner \u2013 specifically Taylor Lautner \u2013 looked at a website. Either Taylor Lautner is far more important than even he knows, or this is a dumb film that was made specifically to anger me. They\u2019re looking at another website now. Hopefully soon they\u2019ll look at YouTube. And YouTube will be showing a full film that we can watch instead of this because dear christ this is an astonishing piece of crap. Taylor clicks a button that automatically ages the missing children to show a simulation of what they might look like now. He clicks the photo that looks like him. And guess what? It TURNS INTO A PHOTO OF HIM. Same haircut and everything. It\u2019s an amazing set of coincidences. You couldn\u2019t make it up. Because you\u2019re not incredibly stupid. The homework is about missing people and, to research it, they\u2019re looking at a website full of photos of missing children. Because they\u2019re morons, they\u2019re making fun of how the children look. And, because this is THE WORST FILM OF ALL TIME, one of the missing children looks EXACTLY LIKE TAYLOR LAUTNER. There is palpable sexual tension between Lautner and Collins. Or there would be if they were both capable of expressing sexual tension. Collins is making a decent fist of it, but Lautner\u2019s pretty much just acting like the Terminator would if it\u2019d been made exclusively to stifle farts and also someone had just poured some orange juice on its circuitboard. For whatever reason, Taylor Lautner has been assigned to partner with Lily Collins on a homework assignment. And Lily Collins has just split up with her boyfriend. We know this because she tears a poster-sized photo of her and her boyfriend in half while looking quite sad. One of Taylor\u2019s friends is a virgin. We know this because he says \u201cI am a virgin\u201d. Also, he likes guns. Just a hunch, but this is probably going to end up being quite important. Right. We\u2019re back. Let\u2019s try and work this abomination out, shall we? There are adverts now. I suggest spending this time by whooping, or punching your dad, or having trouble replicating basic human emotions. You know, to help you get into the film. Also, Taylor Lautner rides a motorbike. And he wears aviators while he does it. Of course he does. Of course he does. I already don\u2019t think that any human beings took part in the making of this film. OK, I think stuff might actually be happening. He\u2019s talking to his therapist. His therapist is Sigourney Weaver. \u201cNot everyone has insomnia and rage issues\u201d she tells him when he says he doesn\u2019t feel like other people. Let\u2019s call her Dr Backstory. Anyway, Lautner is in therapy because he keeps having dreams. Dreams about... AN ABDUCTION. By the way, if you\u2019re not watching this \u2013 and you\u2019re obviously not \u2013 Taylor Lautner is a terrible actor. A terrible actor. Watching him act in this film so far is like watching a sociopath trying to mimic normal human behaviour from watching a Steven Seagal film. Only with a vastly diminished set of facial expressions. The next morning, Lautner has a hangover. And his dad is punishing him by having a violent sparring session in the garden. I already don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, and I\u2019ve already seen this bit. Why are they fighting? Do they hate each other? Is this some sort of elaborate training? Do they both just really love the Andy Samberg film Hot Rod? All I want is answers. And now Taylor is laughing and whooping and drinking beer and doing an annoying dance with two ping pong balls that\u2019s so self-concsious you could quite easily believe that he\u2019s never seen beer or ping pong balls or dancing or people before. Nothing\u2019s actually happened yet, by the way. At an obnoxious party full of unstoppable idiots, Lautner sees Lily Collins. Time slows down, possibly because he can\u2019t work out how Phil Collins could possibly be her dad. Join the club, Taylor. Yeah! Rock music! Rock music that sounds like it should have wikky-wak scratch noises on it! Taylor Lautner sitting on top of a truck bonnet and whooping as it speeds down a road! Rock and ROLL! This film is going to be AMAZING. \u201cDude, you\u2019re crazy\u201d, someone says to Taylor Lautner. \u201cYes I am\u201d he replies. To reiterate, this film is going to be AMAZING. OK, here we go. Ladies and gentlemen: Abduction. Before Abduction: World\u2019s Worst Tenants, which seems to be a show about topless meth addicts who attack bouncers. This is 5*, then. Abduction\u2019s going to be brilliant. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, bored people and lonely people \u2013 welcome to this week\u2019s Film on the Box liveblog. And do I have a treat for you today! Actually, sorry, wait, that was meant to be phrased as a question. Do I have a treat for you today? No. No I don\u2019t. This evening I will be liveblogging Abduction. The Taylor Lautner film. Taylor Lautner from Twilight. The film he made about an abduction. It\u2019s on 5*. It is the precise technical definition of the opposite of a treat. I have never seen Abduction before. I\u2019ve tried, of course, but I only managed about three minutes before it became perfectly apparent that I was quite evidently watching the very worst film that has ever been made in all of human history. I have consensus on my side. Before Abduction, Taylor Lautner was being lauded as a megastar in the making. After Abduction, he all but vanished. It has a 4% Rottentomatoes score. It\u2019s being shown on 5*. Part of me hopes that I just caught Abduction in a bad mood, and that I\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised by it tonight. But part of me, the bigger part, thinks that this is going to be the longest evening of my entire life. Abduction starts in half an hour on 5*. Here\u2019s the trailer. It looks awful.
