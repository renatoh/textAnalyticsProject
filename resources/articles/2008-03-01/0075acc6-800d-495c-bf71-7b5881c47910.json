The British No1, who is seeded 11 and received a first round bye, lost the first four games of a fractious match but recovered well to progress 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. Both players vented anger at the officials throughout the match but Murray was the more composed by the end as world number 85 Melzer slipped from his early high standards. Melzer, who had dispatched Marat Safin in the previous round, raced out of the blocks to open up a 4-0 lead before Murray finally got himself into the match by breaking back. The 21-year-old Scot then held and had a break point on Melzer's next service but in a fraught game that went to four deuces, the Austrian held his nerve to prevail. Murray's frustration was made clear when he swore loudly in frustration at one shot and also complained to the umpire when he felt a let was not picked up by net sensors. But Melzer held to finish off the first set with ease. Murray regrouped to start the next set positively. He took the first three games to take a clear advantage but almost immediately squandered it as Melzer, who also saw fit to complain over some decisions, rallied to pull back to 3-2. Murray responded to break again and then closed out the set off his own service. With Melzer having lost the zip of the first set, Murray began to play with more confidence and broke in the third game of the final set to establish a winning position. Both players continued to show frustration at various aspects of their games but Murray was not broken again and booked his place in the next round with another service break. Murray will play Ivo Karlovic in the third round."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
