United host Newcastle on Saturday with the manager acknowledging failure to defeat Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s team would be unacceptable. Before Tuesday\u2019s goalless Champions League draw with Valencia, Mourinho stated that the club\u2019s crest was more important than the name on the shirt. This indicated that some players did not have the correct attitude. Asked why, as manager, he was unable to ensure his side have the right approach Mourinho said: \u201cBecause sometimes things are not just in the manager\u2019s hands.\u201d It is known that Mourinho is unhappy with the club\u2019s handling of the public outbursts by Paul Pogba and the player\u2019s agent, Mino Raiola. Mourinho believes the issue has become a distraction. United are nine points behind Manchester City and Liverpool, and eight from the relegation zone. Yet Mourinho is confident he has not taken the side as far as he can. \u201cThis team can do much better than what it is doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI said last season was a fantastic season for us and if you want something more, in pre-season I also said that this season was going to be very difficult.\u201d Mourinho explained why he has such high regard for United\u2019s second place of last season, when the gap to the champions was 19 points. \u201cWith all the respect, and I hope they don\u2019t interpret me in a negative way, if we are playing in a league like the Swiss league and we don\u2019t win that league, anything else apart from winning that league would be an awful season,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that season with the potential of our direct opposition, last season to finish second was a fantastic season for us.\u201d He suggested that there was collective responsibility regarding the indifferent form. \u201cThe same people that were to blame for the fantastic season of last season [are to blame for now],\u201d Mourinho said. Newcastle are third from bottom, with two points. If United fail to beat them this would be a fifth consecutive match without victory, a run that has occurred only once since 1999: in November and December of the 2015-16 season under Louis van Gaal. Mourinho admitted if this were to happen it would not be good enough. \u201cYes, I accept. We can win against Newcastle but it is a difficult match. We can win, we want to win. If the effort, the commitment is there that the team showed against a difficult opponent like Valencia \u2013 if we do that against Newcastle [and] we are probably a bit luckier, we win the match. \u201cWe have possibilities to win the match but I refuse to say we have three points in the pocket. I have to respect the opponent, I have to respect the manager [Rafael Ben\u00edtez] with a history of trophies and a history of knowhow. That is the way I was brought into life and football: to respect.\u201d If United fail to defeat Newcastle this would also mean five home games without victory, which has not occurred since November-February of the 1989-90 campaign. Mourinho stated he could not give the reasons for the uneven form but that improving the home record was \u201cvery important\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
