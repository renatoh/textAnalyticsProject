I thought, I don\u2019t want to be part of this'", "bodyText": "Mikel John Obi laughs. He has not heard the comments from the Trabzonspor president, Ahmet Agaoglu, until now and it is difficult for him to conceal the incredulity. Agaoglu, whose club are top of the Turkish Superlig and chasing a first championship since 1984, had clambered on to his soapbox last Sunday to explain why he felt the show must go on. The vast majority of football competition around Europe had already shut down in the face of the coronavirus pandemic but the Superlig played on behind closed doors last weekend before finally agreeing to fall into line on Thursday afternoon and suspend. \u201cFootball is the one thing in Turkey that allows people to get rid of their stress, to entertain themselves and to occupy their minds,\u201d Agaoglu said. \u201cIf they suspend the league for a long time, in a month from now there won\u2019t be enough judges to rule on all the divorce cases.\u201d Mikel takes a deep breath. And then he unloads. \u201cIt just shows you how the thinking there is,\u201d he says. \u201cI just have to be honest and be brutal with what I\u2019m saying. It just shows that they don\u2019t really care about human life. They don\u2019t care about what is going on in the world. All they care about is how to win the league. The reason why I signed for Trabzonspor last summer was to win the league. I gave 100% in every game. But in this situation, where the world is facing such a difficult time, I didn\u2019t feel that football should continue.\u201d Belatedly, the Turkish authorities have come to agree with Mikel. Schools and universities in the country had shut down and flights to many countries had been stopped but there seemed to be a will to keep football going behind closed doors, even if it was not shared \u2013 according to Mikel \u2013 by many of the players. Common sense has now prevailed, although it ought not to obscure the boldness of the stand that Mikel took \u2013 one that, for the time being, has cost the former Chelsea midfielder his livelihood. Perhaps, it was a stand that went a little way to pressuring the Turkish football federation to bow to the inevitable. Mikel\u2019s contract with Trabzonspor was due to run until the summer of 2021, with the option of a further year, but he walked away from it on Tuesday because, to his mind, the money and career security at 32 paled into insignificance when set against being with his girlfriend and four-year-old twin daughters in London and, in a broader sense, doing what he felt was right. Mikel had been opposed to the Superlig\u2019s matches going ahead behind closed doors, believing it to be against the guidance for most citizens to stay at home, and he said so in a post to his Instagram page last Friday. It was the prompt for a whirlwind, when things went \u201c180 degrees in a minute\u201d to quote Mikel, and the battle lines were drawn between Agaoglu and himself. Agaoglu was furious and he told the Trabzonspor secretary to call Mikel and demand that he delete the post, according to the player. Mikel refused. \u201cIt was: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t say that, we are in the process of becoming champions, you have to take it down,\u2019\u201d Mikel says. \u201cI said: \u2018I am not taking my post down. This is my opinion. The world is going through this turbulent time, a scary time. You guys should wake up.\u2019\u201d Cue a face-to-face meeting between Agaoglu and Mikel, featuring the same demand and the same response. This time Mikel says that the club president brought a threat. \u201cHe was telling me if I didn\u2019t take the post down, I was not going to play until the end of the season,\u201d Mikel says. \u201cI said: \u2018OK, if that\u2019s what you guys think, then I am ready to stand by what I\u2019ve said and take the hit for it.\u2019\u201d Mikel was an unused substitute for the home game against Istanbul Basaksehir on Sunday, with the selection order having come down from the top. \u201cThe president told me: \u2018I will tell the coach not to play you,\u2019\u201d Mikel says. \u201cI said: \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d A brief digression. The behind-closed-doors game was weird and edgy, according to Mikel, and, as governing bodies try to work out how to finish seasons, this option would come with plenty of strings attached. \u201cIt was still a risk in terms of passing the virus on, with a lot of accredited people there, and I saw what was going on, I was on the bench,\u201d Mikel says. \u201cThere was no motivation, the players were all scared. There was no handshaking. It didn\u2019t feel right. I just thought: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be part of this.\u2019\u201d Spool forward to Tuesday when the Turkish federation met to consider whether to suspend the competition. Mikel says that, beforehand, a rumour went around Trabzonspor that even if the competition were temporarily halted, the foreign players would not be allowed to travel home to their families. \u201cIt was because Turkey was felt to be the safest place,\u201d Mikel says. When the federation then announced that the matches would continue to be played behind closed doors, Mikel knew what he had to do. He could see a nightmare scenario in which travel restrictions meant that he would have to remain in Turkey for \u201cmonths and months\u201d, apart from his family, and so he called his representatives to push an exit strategy. \u201cThe club said: \u2018If you go, you are not going to come back,\u2019\u201d Mikel says. \u201cSo they were threatening me not to go, you know what I mean? They didn\u2019t think I would be able to take the stand and cancel the contract. But I didn\u2019t care what they did. I said: \u2018If you have to cancel, we cancel. I have to go home to see my family in case something happens to them.\u2019\u201d To Mikel, priorities and principles have been everything in recent days. \u201cAs a man, you have to look yourself in the mirror,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to ask, while all this was going on, did you help the situation and how did you help your family? I wanted to say: \u2018I have done the right thing.\u2019 I wanted to be with my family. \u201cEveryone in Turkey was scared to say something because they might be punished by the club or the fans are going to be against them but I felt that someone needed to say something. Just the truth, what should be done. That\u2019s all I did. I\u2019ve had messages from players in Turkey, telling me: \u2018Well done for standing up because we can\u2019t speak, I hope you understand.\u2019 They are scared to lose their contract, their job. I understand. \u201cFor me, it was about my family, about doing what I feel is right, to help the world to defeat this virus. The only way we can do it is by following the guidelines, staying at home and not playing football at this point in time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
