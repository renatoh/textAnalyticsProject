Bella, enjoying splendid isolation in a large sty well away from the other pigs, grunts dispiritedly. \"One TV crew wanted to film her next to a man in his pyjamas. She wasn't having any of it, picked up one of the handlers on her back and ran off.\" Dealing with prima-donna pigs is all in a day's work for the children and adults at Hackney City Farm, the East End of London establishment that has become fertile ground for television, film and radio. Crews from Peppa Pig, Chicken Run, Big Brother and ITN have stuck a microphone into the snouts and beaks of the pigs, donkeys, chicken, cows and rabbits there and hoped for the best. Demand is such that there is even an in-farm production company called Fonic. \"We're on the side of the animals,\" says Chris Pounds, the farm's genial manager, who has been known to make production teams put in a few hours' graft in the pigsty in exchange for a cameo with, say, Bella the saddleback. \"I had to put my foot down when we were asked to get chickens to queue up outside the Edgware branch of Woolworths for the video release of Chicken Run. What's to stop them flying into the road? So they all marched into the shop and crapped everywhere instead.\" Perhaps the biggest celebrity at the farm's stable of stars (in terms of size, at least) is Larry the donkey. When we meet him, Larry is leaning over a fence, looking like he's ready for his close-up. \"These TV people want Larry to do exactly what they want,\" says Katie's friend Rachel, turning to give Larry a reassuring pat. \"He's far too stubborn for that.\" Rather like Marlon Brando in his prime, Larry does what he wants, when he wants. \"Occasionally, a director will get annoyed when Larry wanders out of shot,\" says Chris Pounds, who is clearly proud of his wayward charge. \"But I don't care; the donkey comes first. And I've noticed that sometimes the real stars get annoyed when Larry's on set because he ends up getting all the attention.\" At a special Christmas service at Westminster Abbey last year he laid down a giant turd near the altar and announced it with his trademark honk halfway through the sermon. \"He's just a fantastic, laid-back donkey,\" says Pounds. \"I don't think the attention has gone to his head - yet.\" The volunteers are used to such disobedience. A cockerel was recently taken to the BBC's Bush House in London to provide a cock-a-doodle-doo for a live World Service broadcast, but it got stage fright and remained uncharacteristically silent for its 45 minutes by the microphone. \"You can't make an animal do something it doesn't want to do,\" says Pounds. \"Some of the TV people can be annoying,\" says Katie, who is, impressively, far more interested in the animals than she is in the world of television. \"They have a go at us if the animals are being pushy, but we don't care. If Bella doesn't want to go in her pen, we're not going to make her just for some silly programme\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
