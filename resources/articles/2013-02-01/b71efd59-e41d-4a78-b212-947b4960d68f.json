This was not the all-action display of old even if he tried to push down flank. Booked Per Mertesacker 3 Slow to respond to Kroos at Bayern's opener and was flat-footed to allow Van Buyten to get away at the midfielder's corner Laurent Koscielny 4 Nervy in defence and gave away the ball for Bayern's opener. He rather shrunk in the face of the onslaught. Thomas Vermaelen 5 Filling in at left-back and clearly targeted as Bayern flooded down that flank, even doubling up on him. Booked Jack Wilshere 8 Burst away from three players into the box summed up his desperation to make an impression. Provided all his side's energy Mikel Arteta 5 His wild lunge into Madzukic earned a booking and summed up the team's early sense of panic. Tidy enough in possession. Aaron Ramsey 5 Bypassed too easily, with the leg dangled at M\u00fcller's cross suggestive of a player off the pace. Happier going forward. Booked Santi Cazorla 6 Initially so bright, bursting down the right, but faded. Arsenal needed him to be inspired to wound such solid opponents Lukas Podolski 6 Peripheral through the opening period but burst into the contest and nodded in Wilshere's corner to give some hope. Booked Theo Walcott 7 Sprightly when offered the chance to spring into space and run at back-pedalling defenders. His efforts never dipped Bayern Munich Manuel Neuer 5 Utterly untroubled until his focus wavered at Wilshere's second-half corner. But later blocked smartly from Giroud Philipp Lahm 8 So sparkling when overlapping down the right, and never shirked his defensive duties. His delivery, too, was outstanding Daniel Van Buyten 7 Tested by Walcott on the turf but was still a barrier, blocking from Mertesacker and winning the header at M\u00fcller's goal Dante 7 Might have used his recent Brazil debut down the road at Wembley as a sighter. Aggressive and impressive David Alaba 5 Troubled at times by Walcott's running and even dumped on the turf by Sagna. But Arsenal could not properly hurt him Javi Mart\u00ednez 8 Can a player who cost \u00a334m be a bargain? He was precisely what so many 'contenders' in England, not least Arsenal, lack Bastian Schweinsteiger 7 Not always the tidiest in possession, but still capable of muscling his way forward. Booked and out of return Thomas M\u00fcller 8 A menace down the flank and smartest to react when Szczesny palmed out Van Buyten's header. Booked Toni Kroos 9 Brilliantly crunched finish from the edge of the area to deflate Arsenal's early resolve. Gunners never truly suppressed his threat Franck Rib\u00e9ry 6 Bayern could afford the Frenchman his quiet game, even if there were still clever touches, glides and passes Mario Mandzukic 7 The striker was a real power in the air, and might have converted Lahm's cross just before the break with a thunderous header"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
