It's a question of having belief in what is going to happen next.\" Getting Thompson back on the straight and narrow, though, is only the first step. He must also be capable of throwing long or short, flat or \"with shape\" as the jargon has it. Some reckon Thompson's throws are easier to intercept because he throws flatter than most. \"The reason people perceive he throws flat is because he is considerably taller than most hookers,\" counters Hardy. \"He's 6ft 2in and the trajectory of release is completely different to a shorter guy.\" And if the threequarters start to whinge about a lack of decent ball? \"We might go back to wingers throwing it in.\" Communication As the team's on-field \"lineout captain\" the second-row Ben Kay calls the shots. Prior to the match, though, it is the coach Andy Robinson who starts the ball rolling. \"Robbo plans the whole thing,\" Hardy reveals. '\"He comes to me and says 'I want to do such-and-such'. I outline the options I think we want to use and we then sit down with Ben. Between us we then formulate a plan based on the personnel we've selected and how we perceive the opposition.\" Kay's decisions are also shaped by where England are on the field and he also has to be alert to opponents unravelling his coded lineout calls. \"We've even changed the actual calling system since the World Cup to stop people cracking our codes,\" admits the Leicester lock. Movement The lineout used to be a jungle, now it's more of a ballroom blitz. Kay, for example, might take a step forward, then two back, then skip forward again either to lose his marker or divert attention from the real target. This elaborate dance is now so commonplace that coaches scour videos for recurring patterns in players' footwork. \"My big disappointment is we didn't get it right [against Ireland] even when we tried to change things,\" admits Robinson. \"When Ben did get into free positions, for example, the throw wasn't straight. We've got to get our technique right.\" Watch out this time for smart variations: the crafty short one to the front or the long one over the top to a loitering Lawrence Dallaglio when England have a throw near their own line. Jumping Good quick clean ball \"off the top\" is rugby heaven but getting airborne is only half the battle. \"Before lifting came in, the lineouts used to be won quite easily but now it's very competitive,\" sighs Thompson. Hookers can also look very silly if the lifters neglect their duties. \"If you listen to commentaries,\" laments Hardy, \"it's invariably 'Oh, he's missed his jumper'. But at the third lineout a fortnight ago Steve's throw was spot on and the jumper didn't jump.\" England also played two specialist middle jumpers; this time Danny Grewcock provides extra presence and the lighter Chris Jones, who can be hoisted by just one team-mate, offers another option. \"I can tell you now we haven't got a bad lineout,\" says Robinson, blaming himself. \"What happened was that I focused too much on ball usage, on what we were going to do once we'd won the ball, as opposed to winning it. I'll hold my hands up, it was a bad error.\" Poaching There has never been anything airy-fairy about the fight for aerial supremacy. Dean Richards and Martin Bayfield, both former policemen, once played in a club game in which Richards decked his opponent with a punch, stood over the prone Bayfield and growled: \"You can tell which copper works behind a desk.\" These days what hurts a side most are \"steals\" by the opposition. For a major Test side to lose 11 of their own lineouts, as England did, is unprecedented. England achieved an 88% success rate in Italy and 93% against Scotland; normally they rate it an off-day if any more than one throw is lost. \"Ireland have the best functioning lineout in the world at the moment,\" admits Hardy. And they will until the day when their lofty secrets are also decrypted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
