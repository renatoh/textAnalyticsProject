Saffron Walden fire service said police had been informed after the incident on Saturday afternoon in Essex and that the child received first aid from a St John Ambulance crew. Essex police said a referral had been made to social care. The car was parked on Common Hill, next to Saffron Walden Common where a musical picnic was taking place. People attending the festivities said an announcement was made trying to track down the parents of the child. Sarah Jordan wrote on Facebook: \u201cWe heard the announcement whilst listening to the music on the common. Absolutely unbelievable!\u201d Jackie Waughman said: \u201cWe was [sic] there sadly \u2026 it was a lovely day on the common then they announced over the mic this sad news.\u201d She added: \u201cYou don\u2019t leave a dog in the car [let alone a child].\u201d Essex police said its officers were present as firefighters broke into the car and were joined shortly after by the child\u2019s relatives. Pictures posted by Saffron Walden fire service on Facebook showed its firefighters had put out the driver side window of the 4x4. According to AccuWeather, the temperature in Saffron Walden reached 22.7C (72.8F) on Saturday. The European Child Safety Alliance says heat stroke (hyperthermia) can occur on days when the temperature is as low as 22C, when the inside of a car can quickly reach 47C. It says hyperthermia can occur in minutes and warns that a child\u2019s body temperature rises three to five times faster than that of an adult due to lower water reserves. An Essex county fire and rescue service spokesperson said on Sunday: \u201cFirefighters were called to reports of a small child locked in a car in Common Hill, Saffron Walden, at 4.06pm yesterday. Crews managed to free the child and worked alongside paramedics and Essex police at the scene. \u201cIt is incredibly dangerous to leave a child, pet or anyone vulnerable locked in a car at this time of year. Please don\u2019t run the risk.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
