Our armed forces served in Iraq with great bravery and distinction, and continue to do so today in Afghanistan. The military and civilian personnel involved in investigating this incident, and in assisting the court to consider it, have done so with great commitment. The Royal Military police (RMP) undertook a complex investigation that would have been challenging in a civilian context, let alone in the middle of a military operation. Monbiot would have people believe that mistakes made are not errors but the tip of a conspiracy iceberg involving a very wide range of people \u2013 including medical staff and the padre at Camp Abu Naji \u2013 to cover up these most serious of (alleged) crimes for a number of years. There is simply no evidence of this. He fails to recognise that this is a complicated case relating to a military engagement that occurred five years ago. There is no recognition of how, after wide searches in the UK and overseas, approximately 140 files'-worth of material were disclosed in accordance with our obligations to the court. Instead, Monbiot claims that some of the documents were \"eventually prised from the grubby hands of the state\" and that \"the government pretended that the documents didn't exist\". We accept that, despite efforts made, further documents were found at a late stage in the proceedings, including misfiled material. Where found, these documents were disclosed as soon as possible. The high court was right to criticise the MoD for failings in disclosure of documents, mistakes in applying for protection of information, and errors in testimony; we have apologised before to the court and I do so again. These failings are real and regrettable, and we are determined to put them right; but there is no malice involved. Monbiot adds that \"20 Iraqi corpses and nine live captives were brought to the camp and all were released without further injury. The Ministry of Defence has stuck to that line like a holy creed.\" However, this was the conclusion reached by the RMP, and is the reason that the Metropolitan police, upon completion of a scoping exercise, declined to investigate this incident further. By alleging that \"when the army is in the dock, Justice swaps her crown for a bandana, her sword for a Kalashnikov and her blindfold for a pair of dark glasses\", Monbiot misses the point that we recognise that the court is not yet satisfied. The defence secretary is committed to a public inquiry in order to ensure that the reputations of those involved, and the institutions that they represent, are restored. Over a hundred thousand of our personnel served in Iraq and, excepting a few individuals, they behaved correctly and with the professionalism we expect, in very difficult, dangerous and often provocative circumstances.
