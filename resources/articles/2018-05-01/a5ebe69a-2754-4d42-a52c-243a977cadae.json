The Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee said a key finding of the Chilcot inquiry into the run-up to the Iraq war, regarding lack of cabinet discussion, had not been acted upon. Its report says the cabinet secretary must be given more power to act if a prime minister decides to take action without properly consulting the cabinet. \u201cIn 2002, Tony Blair promised George Bush that \u2018I will be with you, whatever\u2019, committing the UK to war in Iraq without consulting the foreign and defence secretaries, let alone the rest of the cabinet. Fifteen years later, there are still no safeguards in place within the government to prevent a prime minister acting so recklessly again,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chairman, the Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin. The report says that, although the cabinet secretary is personally responsible for making sure scrutiny of important decisions happens in line with the rules in the cabinet manual, their only resort is to resign if a prime minister decides to ignore their advice. The MPs recommended that this situation should be changed so the cabinet secretary could ask the prime minister for a written ministerial direction to ignore the normal decision-making process and then be able to decide whether to make the situation known to parliament. \u201cIf the cabinet secretary asks for such a direction, it should be at his or her discretion whether this direction should be made immediately known to parliament, or, in matters relating to national security, notified to nominated independent privy counsellors and released to parliament later. Such a mechanism would dispel any doubt about the cabinet secretary\u2019s duty to ensure proper decision-making,\u201d the committee\u2019s report said. While Jenkin said Theresa May had \u201cassiduously used cabinet and its committees\u201d and that the committee had confidence in the cabinet secretary, \u201cthis is no guarantee for the future\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s therefore a perfect time to introduce such a safeguard, when the system is working well, not to wait for another catastrophic failure. \u201cOur proposal is modest, and has the support of many former senior civil servants. We expect the government to consider it seriously.\u201d Earlier this year, May faced criticism from MPs for taking the decision to launch airstrikes on Syrian regime targets without asking parliament to vote on the issue. May said the intervention was \u201clegally and morally right\u201d and necessary to prevent \u201cfurther human suffering\u201d after she said clear evidence emerged that the Assad regime was behind chemical weapons attacks. But her decision prompted debate over the proper course of action for a prime minister who wants to launch a military intervention. \u201cWe have always been clear that the government has the right to act quickly in the national interest,\u201d May told the Commons. \u201cI am absolutely clear that it is parliament\u2019s responsibility to hold me to account for such decisions but it is my responsibility as prime minister to make these decisions.\u201d The report also called for the ministerial code to be updated to set out a list of matters that would normally be subject to collective agreement. A government spokesman said: \u201cThe government will consider the report and respond in the normal manner. Ministers are accountable to parliament and civil servants accountable to ministers. Blurring these lines would risk undermining existing lines of accountability. \u201cThe cabinet secretary supports the prime minister and the cabinet, helping to ensure there is robust system so the most important decisions are taken on a collective basis, ensuring that key interests across government are taken into account.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
