The organisation Military Families Against the War wants the government to hold an independent inquiry into the legality of the conflict and is calling for the prime minister \"to be held accountable\" if there is no legal basis for the war. Rabinder Singh QC, appearing for the bereaved families, asked Mr Justice Collins to grant permission for a landmark legal challenge against a previous refusal by the government to hold an \"effective, independent public inquiry\", which they say is necessary to discover the truth about the origins of the war. They believe the war to have been \"based on a series of lies and to be an illegal act\". The families are seeking a declaration that the government's refusal in May violates the \"right to life\" guaranteed under article 2 of the European convention on human rights. Mr Singh argued that article 2 obliged the state to conduct a proper, adequate investigation when lives were lost. This could only be disregarded if the war in Iraq was lawful under international and domestic law. He told the judge the case raised issues \"of profound public importance and of widespread public interest\", and the public inquiry should determine \"the basis on which the UK actually went to war\". The number of British military deaths in Iraq since operations began now stands at 98. The soldiers of the families challenging the government were the victims of roadside bombs, a road traffic accident, a helicopter collision and friendly fire. Philip Sales opposed the application on behalf of the prime minister, defence secretary and attorney general. He contended that the grounds submitted by the families did not amount to \"an arguable case\" which should go to a full hearing. Mr Blair said there was no need to go \"back over this ground again and again\" when their request for an inquiry was turned down earlier this year. Before today's hearing the families made clear they believed the decision to go to war because Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction was \"based on a series of lies\" and was \"an illegal act\". The families are seeking answers to a number of questions, including \"why the equivocal advice of March 7 2003 from the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, changed so that 10 days later it was completely unequivocal in giving legal support for the war\". The first person named in today's application is Rose Gentle from Glasgow, whose 19-year-old son Gordon, of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, was killed by a roadside bomb in Basra on June 28 2004. Mr Singh read a statement from Mrs Gentle, in which she said: \"All I want is for the prime minister to tell the truth about the war.\" If there was no legal basis for it \"my son should never have been sent to Iraq and would still be alive today\". Peter Brierley is the father of Lance-Cpl Shaun Brierley, who was serving with 212 Signals Regiment when he died on March 30 2003 in a road traffic accident. Mr Brierley said in his statement: \"I had always believed that weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq. I could not believe anyone, particularly our government, would put anyone's lives at risk for a lie.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
