The Christkindlmarkt (Christmas Market) in Domplatz dating from 1679 sells everything from Gl\u00fchwein to handicrafts. The Snow Shuttle operates daily from 23 December and will whisk you into the mountains to a selection of the nearby world-class ski resorts. Where to stay The Hotel Sacher Salzburg (00 43 662 889770; lhw.com) was built in 1866 and is on the quiet Salzach promenade. Doubles from \u00a3132.

Mozart Week (21-30 January) - the second of three annual festivals which will culminate in 2006 with Mozart's 250th birthday celebrations - commemorates Salzburg's most famous son. Next year - lest we forget - is the 40th anniversary of The Sound of Music, filmed in and around the city, so look out for celebrations and tours. Where to eat One of the newest additions to the city's culinary scene is the hip Michelin-starred Esszimmer restaurant (00 43 662 870899; esszimmer.com) opened by chef Andreas Kaiblinger. The interior is a funky modern designer affair, and the restaurant serves classic French cuisine with an Austrian twist. The big night out The area around Giselakai, Imbergstrasse and Steingasse on the right bank of the Salzach is the place to head for designer bars. Saitensprung is just one of many bars and nightclubs in the area worth a visit.
