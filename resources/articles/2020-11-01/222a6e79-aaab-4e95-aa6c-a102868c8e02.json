Serbia are the favourites but Scotland arrive in Belgrade unbeaten in eight games. \u201cWe have to continue to do what we\u2019ve done before because what served us well last month will serve us well this month. We need to reach the same high standards,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cAs we approach the game, I\u2019m perfectly calm. We have prepared as well as we can prepare. \u201cWe spoke about getting to this match in the best shape possible, with a good bit of positivity around us, and we\u2019ve managed to do that. You can see that with the public and the media \u2013 everyone\u2019s really positive about it \u2013 and hopefully we do ourselves justice.\u201d As Scotland edged past Israel on penalties to set up this showdown, Serbia surprisingly defeated Norway. \u201cWhat I would say about Serbia is that they weren\u2019t particularly great in the lead up to the Norway game,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWhen the big one came around in Oslo they produced their best performance in five or six games. So we know to expect their best performance, their best players and their best team. We have to be ready for that. But we have identified one or two things that can maybe cause them a problem.\u201d His main selection choice surrounds Kieran Tierney, who could return to the team on the left of a now-preferred back three. \u201cIf I have to make the tough calls then I will be judged on the result of the game and not the team that I pick,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cThat\u2019s normal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
