Top stories The British government has privately appealed to senior ministers in the Morrison government to develop a more \u201cambitious\u201d climate policy. As the government fends off criticism from Pacific Island nations about its climate policies, Guardian Australia can reveal that the UK\u2019s high commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell, has met with Angus Taylor and Marise Payne since the May election. It\u2019s understood the high commissioner\u2019s meeting with Taylor, who is the government\u2019s emissions reduction minister, took place in early July, while a bilateral meeting between Treadell and Payne, the foreign affairs minister, also raised the need for more ambitious climate action. The UK last month became the first G7 country to legislate a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. With the debate around the low rate of Newstart raging, a 64-year-old woman has detailed how she was forced to volunteer after quitting her job of 27 years to care for her dying husband. Two years ago, Marie Jentner was caring for Siegried, who had testicular cancer and couldn\u2019t walk or look after himself. But when he was moved into palliative care at a nursing home in the Adelaide suburb of Rosewater, Centrelink cancelled Jentner\u2019s carer\u2019s payment, putting her on the lower Newstart allowance instead. \u201cI retired in 2017 to stay home and look after my husband,\u201d Jentner tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve worked nearly 45 years of my life, and there\u2019s no way I wanted to go back to work. And they said, \u2018Well, you need to do something because the government has changed things. You need to be on Newstart. You could do either community work, or volunteering\u2019.\u201d A majority of voters in New South Wales either strongly support or somewhat support removing abortion from the criminal code, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. With debate on the proposal set to resume in the NSW upper house, the latest survey shows 71% of voters in the sample support the change, with only 17% against. A total of 12% of those polled were unsure. The sanguine voter sentiment represented in the poll is at odds with the clamour and contention in the political debate. In the two weeks since the historic bill passed its first hurdle in the parliament\u2019s lower house, opponents of the legislation have fought hard to stop it becoming law. World Prince Andrew should give sworn testimony on \u201ceverything he knows\u201d about his friend Jeffrey Epstein, lawyers for some of the victims of the disgraced financier\u2019s sex crimes have said. Epstein, 66, died this month in an apparent suicide. The medical and psychological condition of 107 people onboard a rescue boat anchored off the Italian island of Lampedusa has reached breaking point, doctors have said. The vessel, operated by the Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms, has been refused permission to dock for 18 days by Italy\u2019s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini. A convoy of Turkish tanks and troops travelling in Idlib province in Syria has been hit by regime airstrikes, Ankara claims. Columns of Turkish forces, amounting to Ankara\u2019s largest incursion into Syria yet, crossed the southern border on Monday, at a time seen as pivotal for Idlib \u2013 the last corner of Syria without a regime presence. Plans to end freedom of movement for EU citizens immediately after a no-deal Brexit have caused anxiety and confusion among European nationals in the UK. Rules allowing EU nationals to live and work freely in the UK would end abruptly if the UK leaves the bloc without an agreement at the end of October. Robert de Niro\u2019s company has sued an ex-employee for $6m for embezzlement and Netflix bingeing. Canal Productions alleges Chase Robinson accrued enormous hotel and Uber bills, and spent hours at work watching and streaming TV. Opinion and analysis The latest labour force figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics demonstrate that the economy is showing signs of weakness. And while we\u2019re not falling over the cliff just yet, underemployment and interest rate expectations are both sobering, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cThings can go downhill fast. A month ago, on 19 July, the market was pricing in a cut in the cash rate to 0.75% and a good chance of a further cut to 0.5%. Now it is fully pricing in that cut to happen by early next year and is predicting a 50:50 chance of another cut to 0.25% within 12 months.\u201d Despite a seemingly unending series of gaffes and unimpressive performances in the two Democratic primary debates so far, Joe Biden retains a solid lead in almost all polls. He\u2019s been consistently between 10 to 20 percentage points ahead of his main rivals nationally and also enjoys comfortable margins in Iowa and New Hampshire. The reason for this, writes Carlo Invernizzi-Accetti, is to be found in what many consider Biden\u2019s main weakness: he\u2019s an old-school candidate, with a policy platform and campaigning style that seem to belong to another political era. In short, he\u2019s a boring candidate. And that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing well. Sport England have named an unchanged squad for the third Ashes Test against Australia, which starts at Headingley on Thursday. Australia will wait on Steve Smith\u2019s availability, after their talismanic batsman was felled by a Jofra Archer bouncer on Saturday and he was diagnosed with concussion. England trail 1-0 in the series. Every Saturday morning in winter, netball competitions across Australia begin when the dew is still wet and the sun has barely peeked above the horizon. But by early afternoon, the A graders play the marquee game: it\u2019s the match everyone wants to see, and it will be talked about until the following Saturday. That\u2019s precisely what it felt like in the second-last home and away round of Super Netball on the weekend. Thinking time: Don\u2019t believe Netflix. \u2018Serial killer whisperers\u2019 do more harm than good Uncork the chianti, serve up the fava beans, have an old friend for dinner: the second season of Mindhunter has returned to Netflix. Plenty of true crime dramas claim that the misdeeds they depict actually happened, but Mindhunter goes further. David Fincher\u2019s series is based on the theories and career of John Douglas, whose 1995 book, from which the show is adapted, is full of claims that the innovative methods he established in the basement of the FBI\u2019s Quantico base were critical in establishing modern-day thinking in criminal and investigative psychology. But can you really hunt a mind? Some of the world\u2019s top forensic psychologists think not. \u201cTo put it bluntly, Douglas\u2019s writings should be in the fiction section,\u201d says David Canter, emeritus professor at the University of Liverpool. \u201cSpeculations about the mind of a criminal have never helped a real-life investigation. It is very often of no use at all to the police how the killer got on with their mother. Many forensic pathologists wouldn\u2019t let profilers anywhere near investigations they\u2019re involved in, because they\u2019re often so unhelpful.\u201d So does that matter, if it makes for good TV? Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reports that a Liberal party branch president organising an event to discuss the party\u2019s \u201cwoman problem\u201d has dismissed the concerns of a former staffer who made allegations of sexual assault within the party. The ABC reports Australia\u2019s defence force is looking to install its technology in Antarctica, even though the Antarctic Treaty explicitly bans military activity. And the Australian reports that Catholic church groups and the federal government are set to clash, as cabinet considers Christian Porter\u2019s plans for new religious exemptions from discrimination laws. Coming up Trade and investment opportunities are expected to dominate Scott Morrison\u2019s trip to Vietnam, the first standalone visit an Australian prime minister has made there in a quarter of a century. The judge in Clive Palmer\u2019s Queensland Nickel trial is expected to deliver her decision on his request to terminate the trial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
