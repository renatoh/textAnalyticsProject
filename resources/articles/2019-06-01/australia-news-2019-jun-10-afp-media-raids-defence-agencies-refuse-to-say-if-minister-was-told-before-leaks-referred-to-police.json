The AFP has confirmed that it began its investigations into the ABC\u2019s report of alleged unlawful killings by Australian troops in Afghanistan and Annika Smethurst\u2019s report of plans to extend spy powers after it received referrals from agency heads in July 2017 and August 2018 respectively. Payne was the relevant minister for both the defence department and the Australian Signals Directorate at the time of the referrals. Both agencies refused to respond to questions from Guardian Australia about whether they had consulted Payne before asking the AFP to investigate, with the Department of Defence saying it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to respond. The AFP faces the possibility of two inquiries into its widely condemned actions when parliament resumes next month. The chair of the committee overseeing law enforcement agencies, Craig Kelly, has pledged to review the AFP\u2019s conduct, while crossbench senators are also pushing for a separate Senate probe. Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, has said a Senate inquiry is \u201can option open to the opposition\u201d, but it would still require the full support of the crossbench to become a reality. The ABC is also considering taking legal action over the raid, its chair confirmed on Monday. Ita Buttrose said the broadcaster had consulted lawyers about its options but had not \u201cbriefed anybody yet\u201d. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re really assessing the allegations to see what actions can be taken and we want to make sure that we\u2019re in the strongest available position to defend ourselves and also our journalists,\u201d Buttrose told ABC radio. Matthew Collins QC, president of the Victorian Bar Council, confirmed he had been retained by the ABC but could not comment further. Buttrose said she would be meeting the prime minister, Scott Morrison, about the raid this week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell the prime minister what to do but I will tell him how we feel at the ABC and how I feel,\u201d she said. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has claimed the AFP\u2019s investigation happened at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d from the government, saying he had been aware the investigation was under way, but had no prior knowledge of the media raids. Under the AFP\u2019s guidelines, matters where the execution of a search warrant may have \u201cpolitically sensitive implications\u201d should be raised with the minister responsible for the AFP, by the relevant minister or department at the time of the referral. \u201cThis enables the government to be informed at the earliest juncture of potentially politically contentious matters that may require investigation by the AFP,\u201d the guidelines state. As the government faces sustained pressure over the nature of the raids, the former defence secretary and former head of Asio Dennis Richardson said agencies needed to be \u201ccautious\u201d about referrals to the AFP. \u201cIf you refer a matter to the AFP they take control of that, and it goes where it goes \u2013 they drop some, they pursue others,\u201d Richardson told ABC radio. \u201cThis one \u2026 was a matter referred to them two years ago and it pops out of the woodwork now. That to me is not unusual, but I do think that it points to the fact that you need to be cautious in what you refer to the AFP if you don\u2019t want it to surprise you down the track.\u201d He said he understood the \u201cemotional reaction\u201d to the raids, but believed it was \u201cmisplaced\u201d to suggest the AFP was trying to intimidate the media. \u201cIt might have had the consequence of that, but everything I know about the AFP would lead me to believe that the AFP is not in the space of deliberately setting out to intimidate the media.\u201d With Australian Associated Press"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
