Narrated by Robert Lindsay's writer character, Sneath, from Friends and Crocodiles, Gideon's Daughter deconstructed events from our very recent collective history, including Labour's 1997 victory, Diana's death and the millennium dome, tackling en route the rise of celebrity culture, political spin and cynicism. Occasionally, Poliakoff played fast and loose with minor facts, relocating, for example, that memorably frothing, soapy, red-carpet-cum-visual-metaphor from the rainstruck 2002 Baftas to the 1997 'premiere' of a film closely resembling Titanic, though the production must have spent a small fortune on artlessly wrapped floral tributes for its not-unconvincing Kensington Gardens shrines to the Princess of Wales. As ever with Poliakoff, the film's visual lushness and oddly cheap-sounding and intrusive music threatened to distract the viewer from the task at hand, but this time, I grappled with a predisposition to fight or flight and, as a result, found myself able to care just a little bit, perhaps because, instead of his usual tin heart, there was a really big (bloody, beating) organ at the centre of Poliakoff's story, specifically the awkward and emotionally passionate relationship between parents and their children, and how that might evolve before it implodes in mutual disillusion, acrimony, apathy or denial. Meanwhile, Gideon's PR seduction of an Italian media tycoon called Badalamenti had been given a pleasingly timely spin by the current predicament of Mr and Mrs Tessa Jowell, though as Poliakoff's 'Berlusconi' merely sought to take advantage of the new Labour government's potential relaxation of the media ownership laws, real life was, as ever, proving stranger and, arguably, far more entertaining. Elsewhere, Miranda Richardson as Stella, a bereaved mother (and, in a typically Poliakoffian touch, hands-on guinea pig lover) who stumbles into Gideon's life and affections, and Emily Blunt as his coolly beautiful, semi-estranged daughter, Natasha, struck the right note between the awkward actorlinesses their director seems to encourage and some halfway plausible characterisations, even during the numerous plodding non sequiturs and plot cul-de-sacs. Would that all Poliakoff's work was as warmly human and, therefore, engagingly, rather than merely irritatingly, flawed as this. Mostly because of the spectacularly fine casting of John Simm and Philip Glenister, I was predisposed to enjoy Life on Mars from the off, but in the event, it exceeded my expectations, which doesn't happen very often, finishing its exhilarating run with an episode that raised the bar of contemporary populist drama so high that it must have TV commissioning editors wondering where to sign up for classes in pole-vaulting. I was already putty in its hands by episode seven when the reliably excellent soundtrack featured the Hollies song 'I Can't Tell the Bottom From the Top', a favourite because the lyrics were written by my dad and, therefore, a mere couple of opening chords can, in an almost painfully visceral fashion, hurtle me straight back to the early Seventies and that hessian-walled, cork-tiled, spag bol-smelling house of metaphorical madeleines. But last week's series finale was so good that I am already worrying about LoM's ability to sustain the quality control over a second series. Though I previously, albeit faintly, praised Poliakoff for his ability to grapple with the endlessly painful and mutually disappointing relationship between parents and their children, those skills were effectively shown to be mere dramatic sleight of hand when compared with Life on Mars's handling of similar themes. Here, the time-travelling copper, Sam Tyler, was confronted by the increasingly persuasive evidence of his father's character flaws and emotional failings, notably when the long-since missing dad he'd grown up idolising was revealed to be not only a criminal, but also weak and selfish, which, as a copper presumably unsurprised by a criminal mindset, was probably the more morally repugnant issue for Tyler. Through all of this, Simm played a blinder. The final scenes, in which Tyler advised his mother on how to break it to his own younger self that his dad would be disappearing for a while but that he'd see him again one day, were tautly written, compelling and touching. And, ultimately, even better for being leavened by Glenister's Gene Hunt proposing a trip to the pub. Where else? Though I probably shouldn't read too much into it just yet, I'm encouraged by the fact that Life on Mars indicates there could be a more intriguing emotional landscape ahead for some of TV's not-so-rapidly evolving hard-nuts-with-soft centres, and that it may be quite a long way from the shallow Blokeworlds inhabited by the likes of Ross Kemp and Martin Kemp. After all, one of the truly great (dare I say romantic?) things about the desirable but elusive state of Real Manhood is that when real men are really hurt, the rest of us can really feel it. On the subject of which, last week the latter Kemp struggled, in a simulacrum of heroic, manful and stoic, to cope with the shifting emotional sands of life inside a two-part psychological, um ... thingy (what would it be exactly? PsychoKillerThrillerDram?) entitled Love Lies Bleeding, which, in its own sweet way, raised the bar of plot-preposterousness to new and Olympian heights. Don't get me wrong; I'm often in the market for a bit of mindless disbelief-suspension, but here it was a genuine struggle to keep up with the writer's demands as we white-knuckled our way from one truly audacious setpiece of plot-bonkers-ness to another. Rather than Claire Goose, perhaps we needed the ITV1 two-part ThrillerDram stalwart Jemma Redgrave to play the living corpse, but either way, by the end of episode one, I had not only stopped believing but had stopped caring whether or not I believed in the badly drawn relationship between childhood partners in crime Kemp and Hugo Speer. Which, admittedly, may always be a problem with the sort of RomcomKillerThriller hailed by ITV continuity announcers as 'a tale of hurt, revenge, betrayal and murder', but which, by an unbeatable combination of plot dementia and creeping banality, managed to trump considerable competition provided by channel-mates Midsomer Murders and Wild at Heart On the other hand, plot insanity and banality need be no obstacle to success if you approach them with tongue firmly in cheek, eyebrow perma-raised and a spring in the step. Indeed, if we must have vapid tosh on the telly - and we must, otherwise we would all go mad with a combination of self-denial and boredom - then let it be top-quality tosh, resplendent in skyscraping heels, pouting at its viewers over the sweetened rim of a glass of chilled caipirinha. Let it also boast a relatively little-known cast of above-average skill and attractiveness, ideally featuring an ice-queen of a blonde bitch and a shaggable bad boy, and let it also feature amusingly knowing cameos from - ooh, I dunno - Joan Collins and Les Dennis. Let it also have a glitzy and hummable pastiche of an American TV theme tune, of the sort that would make a Poliakoff blush beneath his beard. In fact, let it take as a mission statement the business of never appealing to the bearded. Let it, indeed, be the luscious, pouting Hotel Babylon, which has become my working week's guiltiest pleasure. And though Max Beesley may have had a more lucrative role opposite Mariah Carey in Glitter and done infinitely better and cleverer work in BBC3's Bodies, Hotel Babylon has finally made him properly famous outside of the pages of Heat magazine. I only hope he's enjoying it as much as we are. But, let's face it, for every fluffy slipper of a drama, we need a stout walking boot of a documentary, a cocktail-free zone without a hummable theme tune, something which might actually make one think a bit. Handily, there was just the thing last week, entitled, boldly and all-encompassingly, Time. What with being presented by somebody big in theoretical physics and posing the question: 'Do we experience time from within our minds and bodies, or from the outside?', it sounded perfect. Ready for some proper BBC4-style mental cross-training, I was surprised to find Time falling into the patronising pop-science trap usually occupied by Robert Winston, and while we learnt all sorts of barely diverting stuff about comic timing and body-clocks, I can only assume there wasn't enough time in which to address the really big stuff. Maybe this week, we'll get on to that tricky 'How Long Is a Piece of String Theory?' Star politics Last week BBC4 screened The Lavender List, Francis Wheen's drama based on Harold Wilson's infamous retirement honours list. Here are three more political docudramas we'll have to wait 30 years to see: \u00b7 The Lawyer, The Minister, The Tycoon and his Lira: starring Sir Declan Donnelly as Mr Mills, Sienna Miller OBE as Tessa Jowell and, in a bit of insane yet tangential celebrity-casting, Brooklyn Beckham as Silvio Berlusconi. \u00b7 Flash and Ming: 'Flash' Gordon Brown and Menzies 'Ming the Merciless' Campbell unite in a new Lib-Lab pact to outwit the foe known only as Dave Dark (directed by George Clooney Jr). \u00b7 Iraniana: 'a thriller set against the backdrop of the global oil industry, focusing on the human cost of a relentless pursuit of wealth and power' (it says here). Starring Cody Kasch (Zach from Desperate Housewives) as George W Bush and Big Brother's Preston as Tony Blair. Directed by John Brown, son of Gordon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
