It has been an enjoyable escape from us all feeling like this.. See you next week for Dessert Week! This is your one week warning to buy snacks. See you soon x But such sad news for Lottie. She is truly the beating heart of this series. She was so relatable. I loved her cynical, wry sense of humour. And never forget the time when Linda said \u201ctime just flies, when you\u2019re having fun\u201d and Lottie responded... ...\u201cWho just said they are having fun?\u201d Yes, wonderful news for lovely Hermine - who is certainly one to watch out for, and has been one of the most consistent bakers of the series thus far. COME THROUGH HERMINE! After being consistent in nearly every bake, Hermine has finally, deservedly clinched Star Baker. It means that every baker remaining in the competition has won Star Baker once. Nobody has got more than one Star Baker either, so there\u2019s no clear front runner. It\u2019s all to play for. It\u2019s also often said (by me, to anyone who will listen and many others who won\u2019t) that the week seven eliminee is the most talented and handsome of the whole bunch anyway. Lottie\u2019s joining an elite club. Welcome. We\u2019ve had a lovely lotta Lottie, and I\u2019m going to miss her so much. For someone who only packed enough clothes for two weeks (no, seriously), she\u2019s done a cracking job. Her unflappably sarcastic outlook has brought me so much joy. \u201cNot as hot as yesterday,\u201d says Matt Lucas. Flashback to ten minutes ago when we saw a thermostat pointing out that it was THIRTY THREE DEGREES. They have lovely mugs, don\u2019t they. I mean, they\u2019re very clearly empty. But they are lovely. I\u2019m referring to the tableware. Stop it. Someone hug Laura immediately. Paul says you can never keep brownies fudgy in a freezer. Paul, let me introduce you to my friends Ben and Jerry. Laura\u2019s does look mildly radioactive, but I just can\u2019t see it being criticised when the temperatures are so inhospitable this week. It\u2019s like asking them to bake with only ice cubes. What\u2019s the point? Actually, I don\u2019t think Laura\u2019s looks *that* different to Dave\u2019s? Or is that heresy? \u201cBesides the puffed rice at the bottom I\u2019m not getting anything\u201d. Puffed rice is essentially Coco Pops, which she won\u2019t have made. Oh, Lottie. My heart is breaking. Screaming. Extremely relatable, though, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to present something too simple\u201d, says Dave. \u201cHold my beer\u201d, says Lottie and her chocolate puddle. P-R-E-A-C-H I would very much like to eat Peter\u2019s ice cream cake. That\u2019s a bit of me. I did not expect Marc\u2019s ice cream cake to hold up so well given the extreme conditions. At this rate, I feel that Laura is going to present her bake by wheeling over the fridge freezer and just opening the door. Speechless. \u201cYou have one minute left,\u201d says Matt Lucas. \u201cTo do what? Remake an entire ice cream cake?,\u201d replies Lottie. Lottie, that burn risks melting your cake even more. They\u2019re having to ice them in the freezers. Heavens above. Lottie and Laura\u2019s cakes look doomed, but Lottie is trying to make Laura feel better by pointing out all of the various ways in which hers is worse than Laura\u2019s. That\u2019s the Bake Off spirit \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 That awful thump from Laura\u2019s freezer as her cake fell? I felt it in my SOUL. When the temperatures are in the thirties, if their Showstoppers start falling apart, surely it shouldn\u2019t be their fault? I know the producers can\u2019t change the challenge last minute (this series was filmed in unique conditions too), but it feels a wee bit unfair. Sorry I\u2019ve gone quiet. It\u2019s hard to type while my hands are covering my eyes. The constant opening and closing of freezer doors. The sense that everything is melting around us. Who else right now is getting serious Diana Baked Alaska-gate flashbacks? Love Laura using the fan to cool down her boobs, there. \u201cWhat could go wrong?\u201d says Laura, while everything for her continues to go wrong. Noooo! Laura forgot to press the \u201con\u201d button on her ice cream machine. She\u2019s taking it VERY WELL. That said, I\u2019m not sure that the visual of her brown fingers should have been on primetime television. Marc tells us that the tent is 35C. Ice cream needs to be at -30C to set. That means they have to reduce the temperature of their ice cream by 65 degrees in around three hours. This is wild. There are a lot of references to the past in this episode. Us millennials feel left out. What is \u201ca Sting\u201d please? Sounds like Lottie\u2019s going to be making a milkshake. Sounds delicious. Can confirm, sweaty clothes. Seriously. \u201cThat\u2019s risky,\u201d says Paul to Dave. In British speak, this means \u201cthis is a horrible idea.\u201d Supportive Queen Laura is breaking down ice cream for the masses. \u201cIf you can make a custard, you can make an ice cream. Just shove it in the freezer\u201d. To be clear, this doesn\u2019t work if you\u2019ve used Bird\u2019s custard like a filthy cheat, you heathens. MANGO KLAXON!!!! Just when we thought we were safe, Hermine sucker-punched us with her mango-flavoured ice cream. Is this some sort of sick joke? \u201cWe want to see them all hold their shape and form throughout,\u201d says Paul, talking about the Showstopper. Could also apply to me in the days and weeks ahead. I \u2026 just miss him, okay? MICHAEL TALKING ABOUT MARK KLAXON! It\u2019s probably for the best that Mark hasn\u2019t joined us for this week\u2019s showstopper. Remember last time we had a bearded Northern Irish man dabbling in ice cream\u2026 An ice cream cake, in this heat! After a deep fat fryer and shortcrust pastry challenge. This is less of a Showstopper challenge and more of a future baker class action lawsuit isn\u2019t it? Perhaps they can re-imagine them as a chilled soup with soggy cake croutons. Yesterday in the tent was the third hottest day ever in the UK, according to Matt Lucas. Environmental campaigners should highlight how global warming will affect the temperatures in the Bake Off tent. I will personally commit to lower energy consumption after that anecdote about how Hollywood had to peel off his trousers. me: this is an election free liveblog. also me: \u2018A study in millennial fear\u2019 So it looks like Marc and Hermine are up at the top, with Dave dangling at the bottom, perhaps with Lottie? Here\u2019s the standings after this week\u2019s technical. Sixth: Dave (\u201cyou know what happened,\u201d says Prue). Fifth: Lottie. Fourth: Laura (\u201cthe flavours are good, it just doesn\u2019t look great\u201d \u2013 extremely relatable.) Third: Marc. Second: Peter. First: Hermine (she\u2019s invincible). \u201cThe wrong colour, underproved\u2026 and doesn\u2019t taste good\u201d. Apart from that, Dave\u2019s on to a winner. That\u2019s also what I said last week when I put on my work clothes for the first time in eight months. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great look is it, really\u201d - says Lottie, who looks as if she has just done the ice bucket challenge, only without the ice or the bucket. Oh, Dave. You know what they say, there\u2019s no polishing a \u2026 donut. That just looks like a turd. I\u2019m getting real Arrested Development \u201cCornballer\u201d vibes as the bakers are teetering over their deep fat fryers. Peter is referring to deep fat frying as being \u201cquite a rush.\u201d Supportive Queen Laura is even laughing at Matt\u2019s jokes as they soar above Peter\u2019s three-year-old head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s six inches. Looks very large. Big enough, is what I\u2019m saying\u201d. Lottie is boosting male egos across the country. Dramatic wind and subsequent sweeping hairstyles is the closet Bake Off is going to get to feeling like the 80s. They\u2019re sweating through their aprons, bless them. At what point does this become unreasonable? A quick insight - when you take the sides off the tent it gets super windy and all your ingredients blow away. WINDOW PANE TEST KLAXON! Mangoes and pizza ovens left shaking. Oh and it\u2019s a casual 33 degrees in the tent. I think about this a lot... Must be hot. Prue has ABANDONED her coat and is wearing a VEST. Deep fat fryers, in this heat? Are we watching Bake Off or are we watching new police interrogation technique? Hermine continues to sail through. Her bake is referred to as \u201cabsolutely gorgeous\u201d by Paul, words you don\u2019t usually hear from him. No Handshake, though. Remarkable to think that 10 minutes ago she thought - and we thought - she was a goner. Laura\u2019s got a leaky bottom. *Sniggers* Prue complains that Marc\u2019s quiches are too similar, which wouldn\u2019t provide guests much choice if they were offered them at a party. Well, I for one would happily eat both quiches. Heck, when things return to normal I would happily attend a party. I love it when the judges tell bakers that their work is awful and the bakers agree with them. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting\u201d. \u201cYeah, I know, yeah.\u201d There goes Prue, shooting down my hopes for a baked bean and gherkin-flavoured matcha cake Showstopper for Bake Off 2021. This whole challenge reminds me of the iconic Ja\u2019mie, Private School Girl. Supportive Queen Laura is my favourite this week. It\u2019s decided. Her camaraderie is countered immediately by Dave half-heartedly muttering \u201cdon\u2019t worry\u201d over his shoulder. \u201cYou want some help?,\u201d says Laura, bouncing over to Hermine. \u201cYou\u2019ve got ten minutes, they are never going to cook like that.\u201d Although they don\u2019t sound like the most encouraging words to tell someone in the middle of a crisis, Laura convincing Hermine to turn her oven to nuclear might actually save her. That\u2019s the Bake Off spirit \ud83d\udc95 We\u2019ve lost him, folks. I\u2019ll be alone with you for the remainder of the evening. Oh no, Hermine\u2019s having a wobble. Literally. Do you think the tent should invest in some air-conditioning? I wonder if it\u2019s hot in the tent. Hopefully someone might mention it soon. NO SCOTT DON\u2019T TALK ABOUT AIRCON PLEASE NOOO. \u201cJust a smattering of sausage\u201d from Lottie, apparently. Sounds like an ideal morning. Dave is describing his quiche concept.\u201cI think it\u2019s very original,\u201d says Prue, aka the polite British way of saying \u201cDave are you out of your mind?\u201d Scrambled egg in a quiche? Dave is wisely getting in ahead of any comments that his custard might have split. While everyone else\u2019s quiches are melting, Hermine has somehow managed to freeze her pastry. She\u2019s now sunning it in the hope of revival, a bit like when you go to a lovely spa. Seeing the quiches being cooled like this feels exceedingly middle class. Dave seems to have forgotten about the existence of fridges, using a desktop fan to cool his pastry like a middle aged woman by the pool in Lanzarote. Peter has worn shorts every episode, Michael. I bet he was born in 2018 wearing them. The bakers are wearing shorts. We weren\u2019t allowed to wear shorts in my year. I feel hard done by. The world never got to see my knees. It\u2019s so hot in the tent I think everyone is delirious. Noel just casually implied that if ET was alive today he would be using Grindr. Laura is making a pizza quiche. I wonder whether she\u2019s practiced this \u2026 in her Private Outdoor Pizza Oven, perhaps?! (I couldn\u2019t not mention it). While everyone else discusses the 80s, we hear something like \u201cI am really young and I was born only last week\u201d from Scottish Peter. It\u2019s really hot this week so Paul is warning that the bakers will have to concentrate. Because normally, they don\u2019t have to, apparently. Prue has just been reminiscing about her love for a quiche Lorraine, providing the perfect opportunity for me to reminisce about the time Joe Lycett presented Lorraine Kelly with a quiche Lorraine, on ITV\u2019s Lorraine. Shortcrust pastry! Savoury custard base! Served out of their tins! Has this got anything to do with the 80s? Each of the bakers are fondly reminiscing about the 80s. Meanwhile Lottie wistfully remembers, er, \u201cfrozen packet meals.\u201d Cos we don\u2019t have them anymore, right\u2026? Thrilled that Bake Off, despite a bubble year, is still carrying on with its tradition of making the bakers take on challenges that require cold temperatures in the middle of a heatwave. Can\u2019t believe there\u2019s not going to be anyone talking about \u201cbehhk off\u201d any more. And to make matters WORSE he never even got to say \u201cfloyurrrrr\u201d \u00e0 la Nadine Coyle. RIP Mark, my Northern Irish King. Actually, can we make it a mango-free zone, too? Please? Pretty please? I\u2019ll be lurking BTL this evening so do throw any innuendos my way. I\u2019ll be a willing receiver. (Stop it). I have never been more thankful that Bake Off is on this week. Same with Strictly and Gogglebox. Continuity, despite everything, is so necessary at a time like this. So. There has been A LOT of news recently. Some might say there\u2019s been too much, even. Let\u2019s make tonight a politics and Covid-free zone, for all of our sanity, and enjoy 80s week as a little escape. It\u2019s what Thatcher would have wanted. Damnit! Ok, no politics, starting now. Such, such heartbreaking news. Luis will be remembered fondly by all of us in the Bake Off family - such a wonderful man with such a large heart. He was one of the first bakers I remember championing throughout their time in the tent - not least because of this incredible baking feat, which makes me smile whenever I see it: We start with some sad news. Luis Troyano, from the 2014 final, passed away last week. I was lucky enough to meet him a couple of years ago and we got on like a house on fire. He was so kind, generous and good humoured. I\u2019ll miss him. Much love to his family and friends. Welcome to The Guardian\u2019s Bake Off liveblog. Aaaaaaaaand it\u2019s 80s week! Duran Duran. The Berlin Wall. The rivalry between BBC\u2019s Breakfast Time and ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, leading to the overnight success of Roland the Rat. We remember none of it, because we weren\u2019t alive. But the baking possibilities are endless!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
