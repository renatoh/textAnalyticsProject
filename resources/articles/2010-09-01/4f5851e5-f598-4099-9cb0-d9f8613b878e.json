Majority Britain has not really gone in for organised religion for many decades now, but the minority element is still large enough that the pope can pull in crowds that exceed those that any politician or virtually any celebrity could ever hope to attract. Despite Benedict XVI's unbending and in some senses cruel conservatism, the Guardian supported his visit, recognising that there was diplomatic business to do and, perhaps, a chance of reconciliation. Well, the business side has gone smoothly enough, with David Cameron last night packing the pope off with talk of a shared resolve on aid. Our reporting on the millennium development goals today underlines that this is important. There have also been some mightily symbolic moments. The only reconciliation, though, has been purely formal. The pontiff's taking of tea with a Queen whose coronation oaths swore her to defend \"the Protestant reformed religion established by law\" is quite something. The papal praise poured on Sir Thomas More \u2013 the martyr who died defending the pope's power against the crown \u2013 in Westminster Hall would once have been likened to the gunpowder plot. The 5 November celebration is a reminder of the historic reach of anti-Catholicism in popular culture, just as the Act of Settlement is testimony to the sectarian origins of Britain's high politics. Yet the rapprochement required today is not so much between Protestant and Catholic as between the religious and the rest, and Benedict leaves without denting that divide. Things got off on a bad footing with the pope's senior adviser, Cardinal Walter Kasper seeming to suggest that to land into Heathrow was to land into a place rendered third world by multiculturalism. He was soon unpacking his suitcase, but his boss went on to link the Nazis' atrocities with their lack of faith, and encourage silly talk about atheists endangering Christmas. If the pope has not done much reconciling, then neither have his militant opponents. The thousands who traipsed through London chanting \"he belongs in jail\" may not see any connection between themselves and the anti-papist mobs of the past, but there is a failure to afford sincere faith the respect it is due. Rolling 24-hour news beamed all the ceremonies into the living rooms of middle Britain, but only as an anachronistic curiosity. To connect his spiritual kingdom with the United Kingdom, the pope would have had to engage with modern realities, and the country would have had to listen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
