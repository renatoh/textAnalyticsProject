I have a feeling that most writers are larks, starting their day early and winding down with a bibulous lunch. I\u2019m very much an owl, however. It\u2019s not that I sleep late in the morning, it\u2019s just that my brain \u2013 my writing brain \u2013 seems to function best in the second half of the day, after lunch and on into the evening. So the morning is reserved for the mundane business of living \u2013 emails, admin, going for a walk, shopping, phoning, posting letters \u2013 and then after lunch (a sandwich, a bowl of soup, cheese on toast \u2013 nothing too copious) the day\u2019s work really begins. I write my first draft of a novel in longhand. I have found the perfect pen that goes by the bizarre name of a Rotring Tikky Graphic with a 0.2mm nib. It suits my tiny, near-illegible handwriting and I always write in spiral-backed marginless A4 notebooks \u2013 I try to keep my fetishes to a minimum. There are two desks in my study but I always seem to write on the one with the computer, perhaps because it has a view though it's an unexceptional one: a curving side street of terraced houses in Chelsea. Just out of sight is the house John Betjeman used to live in. When I first started my life as a novelist I seemed able to write for hours \u2013 six, seven, eight \u2013 no problem. Now, writing my 15th novel, I can only manage three hours or so before brain fatigue sets in. It\u2019s just like a plug has been pulled out of a socket and I have stopped \u2013 as if a battery has died. Maybe this decline will continue inexorably as I age further, but, anyway, three hours is not bad, and I always seem to manage a thousand words or so. I write every day \u2013 if I can; there is a life to be lived as well, after all \u2013 weekends included. A thousand words a day, seven days a week, is a good rate for me. After I\u2019ve finished the longhand draft, I take a break. The cocktail hour is looming. Wine, TV news, conversation, family, friends and food distract \u2013 a bit. Interestingly, I don\u2019t require isolation or silence while I write \u2013 I can be interrupted by the phone or a knock on the front door \u2013 I just switch off and switch on again. Most evenings I\u2019ll return to the study at some stage and type up that day\u2019s writing on the computer. A novel takes me about a year to write after approximately two years of figuring it out, plotting and researching. The working day, as the book progresses, takes the form of a slow crescendo. It doesn\u2019t start any earlier, it just goes on longer \u2013 the inner owl takes over and, as the novel reaches its endgame, my evening session can go on past midnight into the wee small hours. Paradoxically, the more you\u2019ve written of a novel, the more you find you want to write. One great advantage of a longhand draft is that, in transferring it to the computer, every single word is written at least twice. Then the computer draft can be endlessly revised. Writing in longhand is important, I think \u2013 and not just because I\u2019m a pre-computer novelist (I bought myself my first typewriter, an Olivetti, for my 21st birthday). In handwriting there is a vital head-hand-page connection that a keyboard and computer removes. When you write in longhand you\u2019re unconsciously aware of aspects of your prose \u2013 such as sentence length, cadence, rhythm, repetition, prolixity \u2013 that I find keyboard writing doesn\u2019t alert you to in the same way. Also you can see all the litter of the progress you\u2019ve made that day \u2013 the scorings-out; the arrows; the insertions; the bubbles; the second, third, fourth choices. The page reflects the mental effort that the screen doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a toiling, messy business writing a novel. I go to bed knackered and sleep well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
