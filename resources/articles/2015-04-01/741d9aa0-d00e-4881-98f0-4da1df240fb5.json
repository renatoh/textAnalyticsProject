Cowell, who will return to ITV on Saturday night as a judge on the ninth series of the show, said he had responded to criticism that the talent contest had favoured singers too much in the past. There have been 37 singing acts in the finals. Last year\u2019s winners were Collabro, a boy band from London, whose album went to No 1 in August. The winning act gets \u00a3250,000 and the chance to perform at the Royal Variety Performance in front of the Queen. \u201cThere are less singers this year,\u201d Cowell said at the series launch. \u201cIt was a bit top heavy last year but we\u2019ve evened it out this year. So we do listen.\u201d Britain\u2019s Got Talent ratings have fallen steadily over the past three years. In 2014, the final was watched by 10.7m, the lowest viewing figures since the the first series in 2007. The show\u2019s peak ratings came in 2009, when dance group Diversity won, with the finale pulling in 15 million viewers. The final of the sixth series in 2012, won by Pudsey the dog, attracted an audience of 14.5 million, but audiences have fallen since. With Cowell under contract with ITV until 2016, the pressure is on to prove the show still has staying power. Asked if they had high expectations for this year\u2019s ratings, Cowell, who was speaking alongside his fellow judges Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon, replied sarcastically: \u201cYes, we make this show so no one watches\u201d before adding: \u201cHopefully it will do better than last year. It\u2019s done well over the last nine years, so we\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d He admitted to regrets about his some of his choices of finalists in the past. \u201cSometimes when you do the auditions you do get in a bit of a bubble,\u201d conceded Cowell. \u201cAnd then later think \u2018Christ, what was I thinking?\u2019\u201d Cowell, who despite his unforgiving reputation at a judge, is known to have a particular soft spot for dogs but said he was not tempted to ditch humans for an entirely animal orientated talent contest. \u201cI like the fact that it\u2019s animal versus human,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cTrue story though, someone did approach me in America and asked me if I could do Animal\u2019s Got Talent, but I said no.\u201d Viewers will be able to vote, for free, via a mobile app for the first time. In 2012, when ITV first attempted to introduce a mobile voting platform, costing voters 50p-a-time, it crashed due to the capacity and had to be withdrawn. Cowell played up to his egomaniacal reputation when asked what he thought was the key to the show\u2019s continued success. \u201cI\u2019d have to say me,\u201d he replied."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
