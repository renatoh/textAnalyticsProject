Chris Jordan was invited to open the bowling in a threadbare attack at a venue which has not been a happy hunting ground for the boys in red this summer. The New Zealanders clocked up 359 for three in 50 overs back in June, the Australians 248 for six in 20 overs. For international matches at the Rose Bowl they know how to produce a true, pacy pitch that encourages stroke-play from the most wary of batsmen. Delivering one's first ball in international cricket is a taxing proposition. In the circumstances Jordan's first was rather good. The length was excellent but it was a little wide. Aaron Finch, sensing a novice up the other end, cracked it through the covers for four. His fourth ball was not too bad either. Finch was just as ruthless. Four more through the covers. Welcome to international cricket. Jordan's route to an England cap has been unconventional. He was born and bred in Barbados, where he was spotted by Bill Athey, once an English opening batsman, subsequently the cricket coach at Dulwich College, which has a scholarship available to Caribbean cricketers. From Dulwich he progressed to The Oval, where he spent five ultimately disappointing years, despite showing rare promise as an 18-year-old. He was released by Surrey at the end of the 2012 season at the age of 23. There had been too many injuries and not enough progress. But the move down to Hove has worked a treat. Suddenly Jordan was guaranteed a place in the team and the wickets came thick and fast \u2013 with a red ball. This summer he has been ever-present in first-class cricket and has taken 54 wickets for his new county. His appearances with a white ball have been more sporadic and less successful, which meant that his call-up was a surprise (though not such a big one as that of Jamie Overton, who has bowled 54 overs with a white ball this summer). His selection for this game meant that his commitment to England rather than est Indies was confirmed. So after yielding eight runs from an adequate first over the pressure was on Jordan. He reacted well. In his second over a limp pull shot by Phil Hughes ballooned to Michael Carberry and no wonder the bowler celebrated with abandon. There was a way forward despite the presence of Shane Watson. In he shunted, perhaps a little stiff-limbed for such a young man and certainly a good deal shorter than the preferred identikit for the modern English paceman \u2013 Jordan is a mere 6ft 2in. He once exceeded 90mph, even though he always looked slower than the impressive Boyd Rankin. He was never going to be miserly but he kept his head. Faced with a powerplay over against the rampant Watson and Michael Clarke, Jordan found a way once again. One fierce, skimming drive from Clarke was dropped by Rankin at mid-off \u2013 most self-respecting fast bowlers of another era would have regarded this as three runs saved rather than a missed chance. But soon after Clarke mistimed and Jordan had his most famous wicket yet. At the end he was under less pressure after a little clatter of wickets and he added James Faulkner to his list of victims. Three for 51 from 10 overs when there had been the threat of carnage was a worthy return, especially in an attack that lacked sufficient ammunition. Indeed it has remained a mystery throughout this series why Eoin Morgan and his advisers have been so eager to play so many batsmen, so few bowlers. England's ODI success in this country in recent times has often contained five, or at the very least four, specialists. Yet with a makeshift attack the number of specialists has perversely been reduced to three in this series. On Monday against the odds Chris Jordan was one of those and he did not let himself down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
