The remarks will come in a speech that will also offer what Miliband describes as an audit of Labour in power. It will frankly admit the government has not done enough to transform transport, create a low-carbon revolution, or hand power down to local government. By contrast, the government's achievements in education, tackling discrimination and a new constitutional settlement are real and irreversible, he will say. Since Gordon Brown survived the recent serious challenge to his leadership, Miliband has been arguing Labour has not produced a suffficiently compelling vision of what it wants to do with power. In today's speech he will set out his own vision, calling for the state to empower the individual, and arguing that empowerment is at the heart of the political battlefield. He will also propose radical reforms to party organisation, including non-members being given the same rights as full party members. He will argue political parties are close to death, even warning that \"shrinking membership, declining affinity and fuzzy identity lead many to proclaim that death has already happened, with few tears at the funeral\". Insisting that healthy political parties are essential to ending the democratic pessimism, he will draw on the Barack Obama campaign to prove party organisations can be made relevant. Miliband will also back quotas for male and female representation, open primaries to select party candidates for local and parliamentary elections, donations of part of Labour's income to charity, and a members' ombudsman to guard ethical standards and to develop a citizenship engagement organisation. He will also urge making use of the party's union link to invite 3 million registered political levy payers to party meetings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
