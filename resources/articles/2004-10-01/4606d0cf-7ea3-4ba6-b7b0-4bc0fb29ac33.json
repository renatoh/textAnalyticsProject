The England forward's problem with his back and hamstring stopped him from training yesterday and he will work with the physio Gary Lewin today. He hopes to be in full training tomorrow but will withdraw from the match if he cannot rejoin the squad then. \"If I'm not 100% fit,\" he said, \"I think it's best to be honest with the manager, myself, my team-mates and the whole country.\" There have been calls for the Real Madrid forward to be replaced by Jermain Defoe because of his lack of goals with his new club, but the enforced removal of Owen from Sven-Goran Eriksson's plans would be disturbing. Even without the striker's own reminders, people would have begun to ponder his impressive return of 27 goals from 63 appearances. In the past, Owen was willing to sacrifice himself and he gave England the lead in the 2002 World Cup quarter-final defeat to Brazil despite a hamstring injury. There is no prospect of him acting in that fashion this week. \"I was so desperate to play,\" he recalled of events in Japan. \"In that game, I'm sure that the manager, me and everyone would have taken it if they'd been told I was going to score and then go off. Maybe I got away with that one but if I'm not 100% fit I'm not going to be ready this week.\" His new caution owes a little to his growing recognition of the need to protect his physical condition and even more to a desire to ensure that he succeeds in Spain, where he is yet to score for Real Madrid. \"It's better to build up slowly rather than start with a bang and then tail off,\" he said, trying manfully to remain calm. Hints of anxiety, though, are breaking through and there was a stridency in the way he emphasised his commitment. \"I'm not a quitter,\" he said. \"I'll fight to the death. I'm sure I'll be a success there.\" The England captain David Beckham, who is also Owen's team-mate at the Bernab\u00e9u, stood at the edge of yesterday's press conference as the striker settled into his seat. It was as if he wanted to offer a sign of support. Beckham did give a faint hint that advice from him might eventually be required. \"I don't think it's as bad as that yet,\" he said. \"If he gets a few more chances and gets his first goal in the team it'll be fine for him.\" Owen, who should have scored in the 1-0 defeat to Deportivo la Coru\u00f1a on Sunday, points out with as much modesty as is possible in the circumstances that his record has already established his reputation as a high-class forward. Even so, the adaptation to Spain is slow as he seeks a working knowledge of the language and a home. \"No matter how nice a hotel is,\" he commented, \"it's hard to live in one room with a child who wants to run round the garden.\" England have to hope that he will be physically fit by tomorrow and mentally ready thereafter. As it is, the option of partnering Defoe with Wayne Rooney is no longer a notion to toy with because of its freshness. There may be hardly any other option. Eriksson may be concerned, too, about another injured player. Steven Gerrard's broken metatarsal keeps him out of the squad and Liverpool have now stated that a screw will be inserted today to help the bone heal. It is unsettling news, even if the club still think he will be fit, on schedule, six weeks from now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
