The researchers found that for workers born in regions with selective schools \u2013 such as Kent \u2013 those at the top of the pay scale enjoyed a wider margin in hourly pay rates over those at the bottom of the pay scale than the equivalent gap in areas with comprehensives. The average hourly wage difference between the top 10% and bottom 10% of earners in selective schooling areas was \u00a316.41 between 2009 and 2012, while in areas with comprehensives, the equivalent earnings gap was just \u00a312.33, said researchers from the universities of Bristol and Bath and the Institute of Education, University of London. The highest earners from grammar school areas were also found to be better off \u2013 by \u00a31.31 per hour, on average \u2013 than top earners born in similar comprehensive authorities. The researchers used data gathered by a study following 40,000 UK households. Even after adjusting for gender, ethnicity, parents' education level and occupational class, and labour market conditions, they still found that 18% of the gap could be explained by the school system. Prof Simon Burgess from the University of Bristol, who led the research, said: \"Selective schooling systems sort pupils based on their ability and schools with high-ability pupils are more likely to attract and retain high quality teaching staff. This puts pupils who miss out on a grammar school place at an immediate disadvantage. \"In addition they will be part of lower ability peer groups, which also affects their chances of succeeding at school.\" In England, 14 local authorities operate selective education systems. For the study, a local education authority was defined as selective if more than 20% of its 13-year-olds were assigned their school place by selection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
