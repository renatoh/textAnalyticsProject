On Monday Donald Trump careered all over the place, displaying no discernible inhibitions, his speech a little slurry at times, blurting out words that most people would regret in the morning as he held his second wild ride with the media in less than a week. The US president was ostensibly making an announcement about a new trade deal with the Canada and Mexico, but was also questioned about Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s youthful drinking habits. Trump was quick to remind the gathering in the White House Rose Garden that he has never touched a drop. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, I\u2019m not a drinker,\u201d he said, arms outstretched. \u201cI can honestly say I never had a beer in my life, OK? It\u2019s one of my only good traits. \u201cI don\u2019t drink. Whenever they\u2019re looking for something good, I said never had a glass of alcohol. I\u2019ve never had alcohol. You know, for whatever reason. Can you imagine if I had, what a mess I\u2019d be? I\u2019d be the world\u2019s worst.\u201d It was one of Trump\u2019s rare flashes of self-knowledge in a carnival barker performance that is becoming more and more familiar with each outing in front of the media. Wearing dark suit, white shirt and red tie, Trump played his usual verbal jazz for 90 minutes, basking in the attention and the beautiful autumn sunshine. But it did mean that the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, who is 80, was forced to stand on the podium for an hour and a half. It is not unknown for men who mistreat women to blame their misconduct on alcohol. Trump does not have that excuse, which may have made it all the more chilling, when he immediately belittled a woman reporter. The first question went to Cecilia Vega of ABC News. The president wisecracked: \u201cShe\u2019s shocked that I picked her. Like, in a state of shock.\u201d Vega replied: \u201cI\u2019m not, thank you, Mr President.\u201d Trump apparently misheard and retorted: \u201cThat\u2019s OK, I know you\u2019re not thinking. You never do.\u201d There were some groans and noises of dissent among the press corps. Vega asked: \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Trump said only: \u201cNo, go ahead, go ahead.\u201d Vega asked a question about Kavanaugh. Trump interrupted: \u201cWhat does that have to do with trade? I don\u2019t mind answering the question, but I\u2019d like to do the trade questions, too.\u201d She followed up with a trade question. It is not that Trump is never rude to journalists who are white or male or both. But he frequently appears to go after women or minorities with a particular relish, even at a time when the entire nation is caught up in a wrenching debate over #MeToo and alleged sexual abuse. When CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins tried to push Trump on whether he would consider it disqualifying for supreme court pick Kavanaugh to take up his seat on America\u2019s top bench if he lied to Congress under oath, he again turned nasty: \u201cYou\u2019ve really had enough. Hey! You\u2019ve had enough.\u201d Somewhere in a Republican nerve centre, strategists were probably striking out several more seats that hinge on the support of suburban women. The display followed a news conference in New York last week where the president repeatedly interrupted female questioners. Having witnessed Kavanaugh\u2019s furious tirade to the Senate judiciary committee and Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s no-holds-barred diatribe, Trump is perhaps anxious to keep his crown as the white man\u2019s ranter-in-chief. He complained bitterly that what Kavanaugh and his family had endured was not fair. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to do it to me,\u201d he said, as if trying to be generous. \u201cI think, for me, it\u2019s like a part of my job description. To handle this crap.\u201d Later, NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander followed up with a question probably never before asked at the White House: what did the president of the United States mean by \u201cthis crap\u201d? He answered: \u201cOh, I think the press has treated me unbelievably unfairly. In fact, when I won I said, the good thing is now the press finally gets it. Now they\u2019ll finally treat me fairly. They got worse! They\u2019re worse now than ever. They\u2019re loco, but that\u2019s OK \u2026 I used that word because of the fact we made a deal with Mexico.\u201d As is his wont, Trump also savaged the Democrats over their handling of the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. \u201cI watched those senators on the Democrat side, and I thought it was a disgrace, partially because I know them,\u201d he said. \u201cI know them too well, and you know what? They are not angels.\u201d Referring to one unnamed Democratic senator who was \u201cvery aggressive\u201d, he added darkly: \u201cI\u2019ve seen that person in very bad situations. OK? I have seen that person in very, very bad situations. Somewhat compromising.\u201d Is that a threat? Asked what he meant, Trump replied: \u201cI think I\u2019ll save it for a book like everybody else and I\u2019ll write it. I\u2019m not giving it to you.\u201d Again Trump defended Kavanaugh, claiming his critics were desperate by going all the way back to his high school days. He looked around the Rose Garden. \u201cThere are bad reports on everybody in here. Most of the people sitting down, there are bad \u2013 except for Mike Pence, by the way.\u201d The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, sporting shades, and senior adviser Jared Kushner, smooth-cheeked, and other officials standing behind Trump on the podium grinned broadly. Waving his arms and pointing, the president added: \u201cAnd if we find one on him, I think that\u2019s going to be \u2013 that\u2019ll be the greatest shock of all time.\u201d Pence, sitting in the front row, chuckled and gently shook his head, like a man who has got used to his colleague having one too many. This article was amended on 2 October 2018 to clarify that Cecilia Vega asked a question about Brett Kavanaugh before she asked a question about trade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
