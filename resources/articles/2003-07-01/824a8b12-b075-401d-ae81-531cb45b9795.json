Saturday's debut show pulled just 4.2 million viewers on BBC1, fewer than the opening episode last year, when its initial lack of popular appeal earned it the nickname \"Lame Academy\". Despite a heavy promotional push for Fame Academy II, the 6.30pm showing of the reality show was out-spun in the ratings by ITV1 movie Twister. The Helen Hunt disaster vehicle whipped up an audience of 4.9 million, giving it a 28% share. Endemol's woes were exacerbated when it emerged that Camden Council has given the company just 21 days to reapply for planning permission or face being evicted from the building. The council told Endemol that it may withdraw permission to use Whitanhurst House, the 1920's landmark property where the show is filmed, because of complaints over noise levels, parking and helicopters flying overhead. A spokesman for Camden said Endemol had been given until August 14 to reapply for planning permission and a change of use for the building. The venue was ratified as a conference centre in 1998, but with strict limitations on how it could be used particularly in relation to noise. During the first series of Fame Academy, all the Saturday night singing and evictions were done from Shepperton Studios. However for Celebrity Fame Academy they were done from Whitanhurst House. \"After Celebrity Fame Academy we were led to believe that there would be no series three involving Saturday night evictions. Obviously with Celebrity Fame Academy the evictions only lasted for a week. With the new series they will go on for considerably longer, \" said the council spokesman. Endemol is understood to have put forward a submitted a code of conduct, limiting noise from things such as electricity generators and restricting the number of people who can visit the house to 60. \"We take the concerns of residents very seriously and we are certainly doing everything we can to address those concerns,\" said an Endemol spokesman. However if those moves do not placate angry neighbours the council may decide to act before the August 14 deadline. \"We do have the options of a stop notice but obviously our officers would be reluctant to impose one,\" the spokesman said. The planning problems aren't the only snags to hit the show. Just weeks before Fame Academy II was due to air glitches were found in the show's editing equipment. However, last year's Fame Academy experienced similar obstacles and disappointing audience figures before improving dramatically in the weeks before the final. Early signs that Fame Academy II might repeat that pattern appeared on Saturday when a later showing at 8.30pm managed 5.6 million viewers, chopping the tail off Twister's impact and emerging top of the slot. A spokesman said both the BBC and Endemol were satisfied with the programme's performance. \"The show's performance for the first episode is in line with expectations. \"If you compare like with like our audience share was up 6% on the first show last year. \"Last year the series started with modest ratings and built its audience during the run,\" he added. But the BBC reality show has just one more week until the arrival of ITV's Pop Idol II and a reality head to head that is likely to leave one side well and truly battered. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
