Dame Sheila was a forthright critic of the Conservative government's housing policy during her 11-year stint at the charity. She frequently clashed in television studios with former Tory housing minister Sir George Young, but in private they were friends. Sir George even made a speech at Dame Sheila's Shelter leaving party in 1995. Today he said: \"Sheila was a regular sparring partner. She was hard hitting, but fair. She cared passionately about homelessness, and I applaud the work she did at Shelter.\" He added: \"We remained good friends when we both moved on to other jobs. My sympathy goes to [her partner] Alan.\" Shaks Ghosh, director of the charity Crisis, said: \"Sheila was my big heroine.\" She added: \"In many ways being a critical friend of government is what charities need to be, she was that par excellence.\" Ms Ghosh also pointed out that Ms McKechnie, who was made a dame in 2001, helped raise the profile of Shelter in the late 1980s. \"She put Shelter on the map in a very forceful way,\" said Ms Ghosh, \"she understood that the media is drawn to strong personalities - she lived and breathed personality. Sheila was Shelter and Shelter was Sheila.\" Ms Ghosh added: \"Sheila used to say she had a mental wardrobe of the clothes worn by her heroes - depending on the situation she would pretend to put on their clothes and become that person.\" \"I put on a Sheila McKechnie outfit when I need to be really strong about homelessness.\" Shelter's current director, Adam Sampson, said: \"Anyone who had ever worked or been in contact with her will deeply saddened by Dame Sheila McKechnie's death at such an early age. \"Between 1985 and 1994, as director of Shelter, she was an enormous force for positive change and campaigned relentlessly to move homelessness and bad housing up the political agenda.\" Mr Sampson added: \"Over that decade she campaigned to maintain levels of social house building in the face of the Conservative government's policy of selling off council homes. She also made Shelter's name synonymous with social campaigning by putting in place structures that ensured the long-term viability of the organisation.\" He said one of her most important legacies was establishing the foyer movement in the UK which aims to break the cycle of homelessness and unemployment by providing young people with training and a home under one roof. And former Shelter director Chris Holmes said Dame Sheila will be remembered for her \"campaigning zeal\". He said one of most her most significant contributions was her outspoken opposition to the Conservative government's move to scrap the duty of councils to give a permanent accommodation to homeless families. \"The strength of Shelter's opposition to the idea in 1993 was crucial to getting the legislation repealed,\" Mr Holmes said. He added: \"At the time the government was giving \u00a31m a year to the homeless advisory service, and there was a pressure not to rock the boat. It was brave to oppose the government so strongly.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
