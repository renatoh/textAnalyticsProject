Despite turning over a similar sum of money to the Budgens in Never Haddam; despite generally being run by people who have little or no experience on the board of FTSE top 100 companies, despite shocking share performances (if you'd bought Villa shares five years ago you'd have lost 85 per cent of your money, Leeds shares - 78 per cent, Chelsea - 75 per cent, Newcastle - 73 per cent... ), despite an absence of profits and dividends during the boom years, despite all of the above, they like to consider themselves the very model of a twenty-first century company. And if they want to labour under such a delusion then good luck to them. But they could work a bit harder on their public relations. People who work in financial PR often complain about their difficulties in enticing journalists to listen to their clients. There is no such problem with football, where there are acres of newsprint to be filled with anything and nothing said about football by anyone and no one. Hundreds of pages of free advertising for their product every day... you'd think they might be chatty. Friday lunchtime, Chelsea training ground - it is Christmas and Claudio Ranieri, the Chelsea manager, has agreed to talk to the Sunday papers. It starts well. Ranieri announces he will field the same team. This is no surprise. Chelsea have only conceded one goal in their past seven matches as the defensive line of Melchiot, Terry, Gallas and Babayaro begins to cohere so well that Marcel Desailly - assuming he can be bothered to play - might not get a game. Furthermore, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen are beginning to show signs that they could form an effective partnership. This might mean the fans' darling, Gianfranco Zola, is relegated to the bench, which, sadly, after all he has done for the club, but, inevitably, is probably now his best position. 'Eidur and Jimmy are playing very well but I need Gianfranco, who is still very important,' says Ranieri. And in the midfield, well, Ranieri is prepared to defend the seemingly indefensible. 'Jokanovic protects the back four. I understand why the fans boo him because he takes a lot of the ball but sometimes the rest of his team-mates don't move for the ball. He takes the responsibility. He's got a good character.' No mention of pace there, which is perhaps just as well, for while the 33-year-old is quicker than he was last season that doesn't mean he is any faster than laggardly. The interview progresses without incident or particular insight for the next few minutes. The Chelsea philosophy: 'To try to win.' Sam Dalla Bona: 'If he plays he stays.' And then everything begins to go awry as the pesky journalists ask him whether it bothers him that the fans are singing for Vialli. 'It's not my problem I just want to win. It is very strange but in the street the fans are all with me,' replies Ranieri. Not that strange, really, fans saying one thing to your face and screaming something entirely different from their safe seat in the stands. The journalists, keen to develop a theme, stick to their point. 'I don't think about Ranieri,' says Ranieri. 'I think about Chelsea Football Club. I'm not interested in public relations.' Fair enough. Then things become fuzzy. There may be an element of misinterpretation. Whatever, Ranieri flounces out with a curt goodbye. That's all folks. Not just for the purposes of a Chelsea-Liverpool preview but for the season. The whole thing is called off. Before your correspondent can ask if Frank Lampard is entirely happy with his present berth on the wide right or would be more comfortable occupying half the engine room alongside the dynamic and combative and, let's be honest, pony-tailed Manu Petit, the diminutive and softly spoken Italian has scarpered. Which is a shame. Then, Gwyn Williams, the Chelsea assistant manager who has risen through the club without trace, or, indeed, experience of football management, goes bonkers. Having expressed his opinion - 'There's media and there's media' - he goes on to say: 'I'm not going to argue about it... The answer's \"No\".' So, if anyone from a Sunday paper wants to talk to Chelsea the answer will be no. Any and every question, it appears, will be answered with a 'no'. Is the club financially stable? Is Ken Bates sane? Will they win a Champions League place? All these questions will never be asked or, I suppose, on the off-chance Williams is consistent, will be answered with a 'No'. Williams is in his master's image with one distinguishing characteristic. He is Ken Bates without the sense of humour. A genetic mutation, which is entirely terrifying. His parting shot is enigmatic. 'You make your own beds,' he says with some menace. Indeed we do, Gwyn. And in today's multimillion pound game to admit to being unable to afford a live-in maid is, of course, humiliating. One-nil to the assistant manager. That people at Chelsea Football Club should be mildly paranoid is hardly a news story. Their chairman, Ken Bates, is notoriously quick with a writ as he continues his campaign to transform the sports pages into an extension of his programme notes. It is a campaign that has the effect of merely giving substance to their paranoia as, having been silenced, everyone asks: 'What have they got to hide?' Their attitude is best summed up by the Millwall chant, 'No one likes us, we don't care.' Which makes business sense. After all, Millwall shares went up a penny last week. Over at Liverpool, not a plc, Phil Thompson said: 'It is disrespectful of people to call us negative and boring. We defend as a unit, everyone works together and we just happen to be a little better at it than most. We had the same thing said about Liverpool in my day - but we still won seven League titles and three European Cups.' Turning to today's opponents, he said: 'Chelsea are the Premiership team I'd pay most to watch.' Perhaps Thompson should do Chelsea's press conferences from now on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
