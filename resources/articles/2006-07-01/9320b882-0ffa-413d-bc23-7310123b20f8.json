Lynsey Summers screamed in horror as a midwife showed her a dead infant who looked completely different to her own child, who had died two hours after being born. A midwife who had brought the box from the mortuary insisted it was the right baby until the mother pointed out that the name on the tiny coffin was different. North Devon Hospital in Barnstaple admitted the error, apologised, and promised to tighten up controls in the mortuary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
