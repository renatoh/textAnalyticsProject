Unveiling Syriza\u2019s programme after formally requesting parliament\u2019s dissolution, Tsipras acknowledged the \u201canger and fatigue\u201d that had led to the leftist party\u2019s crushing defeat in the European parliamentary elections and pledged that job creation and lower taxes would be the central pillars of a new term in office. \u201cGreeks have the right to hope,\u201d the prime minister told Syriza party cadres, recalling years of strict supervision by bailout creditors keeping the debt-stricken nation afloat. \u201cWe had to clench our teeth and take difficult decisions on a road that was not at all easy \u2026 I understand the anger and fatigue of many but now we deserve a chance to govern for the first time without our hands tied.\u201d The embattled leader was forced to call a snap election four months ahead of schedule after Syriza lost by an unprecedented 9.5 points to the main opposition New Democracy party in the European vote and by an even wider margin in local polls also held in May. On Tuesday the vote was set by presidential decree for 7 July. The scale of the leftists\u2019 defeat, described as a \u201chuge shock\u201d by senior Syriza figures, was attributed mostly to the loss of the middle class, hit by a regimen of high taxes in the four years since Tsipras assumed power. An unusually high abstention rate was also blamed. The result was a far cry from 2015 when the once tiny party seized power vowing to \u201ctear up\u201d the accords of draconian austerity that Athens had signed with lenders. But in a bid to regain ground lost after being forced to adopt the very policies he had once railed against, Tsipras has now taken a leaf from his conservative rival\u2019s book, promising to reduce income tax and a much loathed property tax. Singling out women and Greek youth affected by record unemployment \u2013 the most toxic byproduct of the debt crisis \u2013 the 45-year-old PM vowed his priority would be the creation of half a million jobs to bring jobless levels in Greece in line with other parts of the EU. At just under 20% the unemployment rate remains the highest in the bloc even if the country is also on the road to economic recovery \u2013 albeit with a sluggish growth rate of 1.3%. In an atmosphere that has been unusually charged, Tsipras has repeatedly said voters face \u201ca dilemma\u201d between the old forces that bankrupted Greece and a new progressive alliance with the vision to navigate it into the future. \u201cOur country has to change fundamentally; we have to build it from the beginning,\u201d he roared, calling on Greeks from all political persuasions to come onboard. Packed into the central atrium of the capital\u2019s concert hall to hear Tsipras speak late on Monday, Maria Varvaka, a drama teacher, echoed the belief of the diehard leftists around her. \u201cFor the first time we have had a government whose agenda was not ruled by fear,\u201d she said, drawing on a handmade cigarette. \u201cIt proved our society is not as conservative as it seems. It tackled the [name] issue of Macedonia, it handled migrants and gay people with an equality never seen. I\u2019d like to think it could win again.\u201d Last year, to the fury of many, Tsipras ended the decades-long name row between Athens and Skopje when the two capitals struck a deal that saw the Balkan country agree to call itself North Macedonia to appease Greek fears of territorial expansion. In return Greece lifted its objection to its neighbour beginning accession talks with Nato and the EU. With the opposition prevailing in polls, there is a sense that Tsipras is going through the motions. An opinion survey released by Metron Analysis in the aftermath of the European polls showed New Democracy, under the stewardship of the consensual Kyriakos Mitsotakis, widening its lead to a seemingly unassailable 10.2 points over Syriza. As the leftists geared up for the intense politicking of the 26-day campaign that lies ahead, optimism, even in the euphoria of a top-table party event, appeared in short supply. \u201cThe mood has not been great but we have to refind our soul and fight this not with slogans but with arguments as our programme seeks to do,\u201d the migration minister, Dimitris Vitsas, told the Guardian as he, too, drew heavily on a cigarette. \u201cMost of those who abstained in the Euro polls were natural Syriza supporters. If we can win them back then I honestly believe we have a chance of winning again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
