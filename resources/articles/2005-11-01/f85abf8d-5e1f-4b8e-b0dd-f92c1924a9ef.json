I had imagined that the most ancient and populous nation in the Arab world would breakfast frugally before dawn, break bread after dark and sleep deep through the night in preparation for the pious privations of the following day. I was wrong. In Cairo at least, Ramadan is a riot; a celebration of nocturnal food and fun. When the sunset canons have sounded, the city cranks itself into party mode. Charcoal under shisha (flavoured tobacco) pipes is fanned to an amber glow, tea samovars bubble to the boil, damp hands rub poultry with unguents and thread kebabs on to skewers, and boy racers tear through the streets parping their horns. Venture abroad during the day and a few souls may be observed at table. These are likely to be Coptic Christians, whose first-century Eastern Orthodoxy commands they fast 210 days of the year. On these days, meat, fish and dairy products are proscribed; hence the Copts have developed an extraordinarily tasty repertoire of vegan cuisine. One hungry lunchtime, I was delivered by cab to Felfela, where I was served ta'amia (falafel) so fresh and light and splendidly spiced that they spoilt me for the oily, mucky pucks usually offered in the west. Made from mashed white broad beans, they were rolled tightly, two at a time, in soft flatbreads splashed with garlic sesame sauce and stuffed with minty, parsley, oniony salad. Crunchy, juicy, soft and hot, Felfela's falafel were enough to make me consider a new life as a vegan. Until, that is, the moon rose, and with it the haze of a thousand braziers. As street-side chefs fan their fires with feathered bats, and paint-starved apartment blocks hiss to the sizzle of grills on their balconies, restaurants set up for the Ramadan rush. Better-known establishments erect gorgeous, gaudy painted and woven tents on their pavements to accommodate recently risen revellers. One such joint, Aboo Ramy, is in the Citadel overlooking Old Cairo, next to the open-air abattoir. Serving sensational grills and lots of offal it is not for the faint hearted, although what it lacks in basic hygiene it makes up for in character. Film stars, extended families and assorted low-lifes eat at stunted tables, inches above the gutter. Puffs of rough bread are torn to shovel up earthy hoummous and sharp moutabal, the thick garlic-pungent paste of grilled aubergines with tahina. As the night wears on, so the baladi belly-dance from the restaurant beat-box insinuates itself through the warm evening air. Instead of doilies, platters are carpeted with a shag-pile of chopped parsley, on which arrive lamb sausages and kidney titbits, chicken wings and entire pigeons stuffed with rice and pine nuts. Tubs of incendiary pickles (known locally as \"whisky\") stoke the digestive fire, which is later placated with pillows of buttery rice studded with scraps of mincemeat and fried vermicelli. With the whole night ahead, one's breakfast-cum-dinner seems to reach as far forward as Egypt's ancient history stretches behind. The welcome extended by staff and fellow diners to this western Jew is open-hearted and human, genuine and warming. After tall tales, backslaps, many glasses of mint tea, a bill for less than a tenner and feeling as stuffed as the poor pigeon, I step into the alive night, and walk like an Egyptian. \u00b7 Felfela Alaa el Din, 15 Sharia Hoda Sharawi.
