Appearing before the Hutton inquiry, No 10's communications director repeatedly described his frustration and anger with the BBC over its failure to take on board that it may have been wrong when it reported that the government had \"sexed up\" the government's September intelligence dossier on Iraqi weapons. Mr Campbell lumped the corporation in the same category as \"the Mail group\" for driving \"a particular agenda\" on the war - a comparison that will surprise both the BBC and the newspaper firm, which are normally at loggerheads. Mr Campbell has always denied that the government transformed the September dossier and used his appearance at the Hutton inquiry to round on the BBC's equally intransigent stance. He said he was horrified that the BBC had not put its story to the Ministry of Defence for comment before it was broadcast and frustrated that he had no form of redress after it was aired. Mr Campbell also railed against defence correspondent Andrew Gilligan's \"lack of ethics\" for basing his story on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on a single source. \"I was for many years a journalist before I worked for the prime minister. I worked on a tabloid newspaper and there is no way in the world that a tabloid paper would have run a story like that without giving them a chance to respond, be that a government minister or, in the case of the Mail on Sunday article, me. \"I find it unbelievable that those allegations were not put to us in advance.\" Lord Hutton asked Mr Campbell if he felt that a source might withdraw or water down their criticism if a journalist was to return to them for confirmation. Mr Campbell said that was not his complaint, but once again said he felt it was extraordinary that the Gilligan report was not checked with other sources or with government officials. He admitted his relationship with the media at this time was not very good, however, and that he may have reacted too angrily to the BBC after it rebuffed a 12-point letter he had sent to the corporation's head of news in late June. \"I asked a series of specific questions and a good half to two-thirds of the letter was actually raising issues that I had not raised. \"It led, in me, to a real mounting sense of anger and frustration. To me it was becoming impossible for me to deal with this.\" Mr Campbell also described the night he \"stormed\" into Jon Snow's Channel 4 News studio, saying he had had been angry because he learned of the BBC's reponse that day. Mr Campbell had been at Wimbledon watching the tennis with his son and the contents were read to him over the telephone. Asked to describe his feelings about the letter, Mr Campbell said he was \"probably too angry\". He explained that after leaving Wimbledon, he had driven back to Downing Street where he watched the 6pm BBC news, which he said angered him further because it was \"like listening to a press release against the government\". The Downing Street press office told him later that Channel 4 had requested an interview. Mr Campbell did not usually give interviews, but on this occasion he agreed. \"I felt I was on top of the detail, it would take some time to brief a minister,\" Mr Campbell said. \"I phoned the prime minister and discussed it with him. He gave his consent.\" Mr Dingemans asked Mr Campbell if the suggestions that he had \"stormed into the studio\" of Channel 4 were fair or unfair. Mr Campbell answered: \"It did not fit with the description I have just given.\" He explained that the invitation to appear on Channel 4 News had at first been turned down but had then been accepted, and he was then driven to the studio. Mr Campbell said Mr Snow did appear surprised that he was there but \"that's more to do with communication within Channel 4 than to do with me\". Mr Campbell said he felt the performance of junior minister Ben Bradshaw on the Today programme had gone \"exceptionally well\" and explained that he had rebutted claims that the MoD had been contacted prior to Mr Gilligan's report. Separately, Mr Dingemans asked Mr Campbell how he felt about the press coverage of June 7 - a week after the allegations about the dossier were initially made \"It was getting worse. The Sunday papers are often even more difficult than the daily papers and there was an awful lot about the dossier, about me, about my position and a story falsely claiming I had apologised to the head of MI6 for allegedly abusing intelligence. The inquiry also heard how Lord Birt, the former director general of the BBC, encouraged Mr Campbell to keep up his fight with the BBC, sympathising with the government's cause at a crucial stage in its battle with the corporation. The former BBC boss, who now works as one of Tony Blair's special advisers, was consulted by Mr Campbell at the beginning of July about the war of attrition that had been sparked by a Today programme report on May 29. And he told the Downing Street director of communications that the situation was \"terrible\" because everyone knew the BBC allegations that the government had \"sexed up\" the Iraq intelligence dossier were \"wrong\". At this point the prime minister had told Mr Campbell \"things were going fine\" but indicated a possible weariness with the escalating row, believing the foreign affairs committee should act as the ultimate referee. \"The prime minister asked me where this was going and I had spoken to John Birt the day before and he said it was terrible for the BBC because everyone knew the story was wrong,\" Mr Campbell told the Hutton inquiry. The emergence of Lord Birt at the inquiry comes as a surprise - he has steadfastly held his counsel on virtually all matters of broadcasting since he quit the BBC in 1999. Only once did he break his silence, and that was to publicise his autobiography. Mr Campbell told Mr Blair about Lord Birt's views on July 1 but he had also spoken on June 28 to the prime minister, who said he wanted him to step back from the front line. \"At that stage the prime minister was saying to me, 'Look, this is clearly quite an intense row that is going on. You have to keep... keep going but then we have to just, after a day or two, just leave it to the committee,\" Mr Campbell recalled. Asked by the inquiry whether this meant the \"foreign affairs committee were appointed referee whether they liked it or not\", Mr Campbell replied: \"Yes\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
