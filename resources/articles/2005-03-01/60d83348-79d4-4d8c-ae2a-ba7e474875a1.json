Perhaps we'd do better if we started younger. Language-book publisher Berlitz believes so and has released a Baby Berlitz series of Spanish lessons for those who are only just learning their own language. Titles include Baby Talk and Tunes, an audio CD with singalong songs, repeatable words and phrases about eating and playing (\u00a35.99), and Baby's Animal Friends , a 'talking' book which says words in English or Spanish when kids press buttons (\u00a33.99). Meanwhile for grown-ups, Berlitz has launched a new 'Guaranteed' series, with audio-only courses in French, Italian, German and Spanish, available on CD for \u00a312.99 each. Alternatively try Eyewitness Travel's new 15-Minute Italian, French, German or Spanish series, released on 7 April for \u00a36.99, combining a book and CD."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
