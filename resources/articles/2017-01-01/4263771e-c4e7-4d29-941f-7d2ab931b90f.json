They may not like the answers they get, but Cassie loves the revelations \u2013 thrilled by the prospect of a potential terrorist angle and heartened at David Walker\u2019s story becoming clearer as the fog of the past starts to lift. The victim Sunny hits up David\u2019s best friend, James Gregory, to put some meat on the bones of his dark past. He tells him that David\u2019s abuse took place from 1958, when he was seven, and continued until the teacher left a year later. Gregory believes the abuse was why David threw himself into sex workers, booze and drugs: \u201cTo blot it all out, all that shame and guilt.\u201d Gregory confirms that David confronted his abuser but was met only with denials and threats. A picture of a lonely, troubled man desperate for closure emerges. DI Tessa Nixon So far, Paul Nixon has been the super-understanding husband helping his wife through a challenging time. Now, though, he tells her how strange he finds it that this event a lifetime ago is affecting her so much. \u201cAm I not following the manual, Paul?\u201d Tessa fires back, witheringly. That told him. Still, he wonders if there\u2019s anything she needs to tell him? She flashes back to a girl dabbing blood from her mouth and assures him that there is nothing, not a thing, she needs to share. At work she continues to be sidelined, locked out of her own office because of her connection to the David Walker case. For a woman used to being in control, it\u2019s tough to take. Colin Osborne Colin is a man with many layers, most of them not accessible to the public. His husband Simon knows him best and he more than anyone feels that little something missing, that instinctive recoil from intimacy (\u201cthat thing you do that you\u2019ve always done \u2013 that part of you you keep from me\u201d). Cassie\u2019s attack dog Murray heads to Klein Edgerson and interviews Hugh Moray, Colin\u2019s old work buddy from his banking days, to learn more about this walking enigma. He hears about a classic type A personality \u2013 industrious, smart and best of all, a man with \u201cserious nuts\u201d. But before Murray can press him any more, Moray clams up. He\u2019ll be taking legal advice before talking further. The ranks are closing. But we see another side to Colin as he hands over the hush money to Tyler. His hand firmly on the man\u2019s arm, he hisses: \u201cIf you ever threaten my family\u2019s future happiness again I will hurt you. I will hurt you very fucking badly.\u201d You might want to get measured for that suitcase, Tyler. This guy\u2019s got serious nuts. Another layer of Colin is peeled back when the Conservative party send over a Hello! magazine cutting featuring a photo of \u201cparty donor Colin Osborne\u201d with \u201cnightlife supremo\u201d David Walker at the Conservative party Valentine\u2019s Day Ball. \u201cI honestly have no recollection of having met this man,\u201d says Colin dishonestly, while having a clear recollection of having met that man. He does, however, come clean about leaving Klein Edgerson because of the nervous breakdown that got him sectioned and detained in hospital. We\u2019re getting closer with Colin, but he is not giving up his secrets easily. Marion Kelsey Remember that brief mention of a Mrs J Dunphy, the 80-year-old widow at 20 Raglan Way? It turns out to be Joy (Wendy Craig), Marion\u2019s mom. When Cassie brings up early 1990, Mrs Dunphy pipes up. \u201cDaddy and I were in America and Marion broke in.\u201d Way to drop your daughter in it, Joy! Marion tells Cassie quite a different story when they talk. Her father was on a lecture tour of America for three months, she needed a place to stay and still had a key so let herself in. No \u201cbreak-in\u201d at all. Fair enough, but what\u2019s really interesting Cassie is 32 Smoke Lane. That\u2019s the London address where Marion was living when she caught a case for assaulting a police officer at a demonstration for the release of the Guildford 4. Living with her was Sinead Mary Quinn, a woman imprisoned for IRA activities in 1992. All of a sudden a political motive for the killing becomes a possibility. Marion ends the talk with Cassie abruptly, leaves an abusive phone message for Joy, then goes to the pub with Zoe. So much for keeping that relationship professional. Even that ends badly when she makes cruel comments to Zoe about their friendship. As the stress increases, Marion is as close to breaking point as we\u2019ve seen her. Sara Mahmoud Sara is away with the fairies this week, blanking a friend at the mosque, dodging Sunny\u2019s calls and sucking anxiously on her asthma inhaler. Fran has been unable to confirm her alibi, so we\u2019re still eyeing her suspiciously. Her husband Hassan is the same. He knows something\u2019s not right and tells her so. With a deep breath she confesses all. Moments later, Hassan knows that his wife is a former sex worker and a suspect in a murder case. He walks off without a word. Sara is crushed. We finish on a pub meeting between three of the core four: Sara, Marion and Colin. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re teaming up for quiz night. Notes and observations Cassie quickly folds under questioning and admits opening and reading her dad Martin\u2019s bank statement. Martin has a confession of his own. He went to Winchester to find the man his wife had an affair with. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s not the body they dig up in series three. David Walker being an unstable character into violent sex gives us an obvious motive for his killing \u2013 perhaps too obvious? Sunny gets a break from taking grief from his daughters with a Tinder hook-up in Brighton. Unforgotten doesn\u2019t spend too much time on the private lives of plod but I will be very disappointed if we don\u2019t see this. Simon finally knows about Colin being questioned over the murder. Every step is an adventure married to this guy. Marion\u2019s father was on a lecture tour in 1990. If he\u2019s in education that fits in with being a teacher in the late 1950s. I don\u2019t see Marion killing to protect him but Joy and Elise are definite persons of interest. Jason comes to the station to spend time with what\u2019s left of his father and say goodbye, reminding Cassie that for him this is anything but a cold case. You can\u2019t infer too much from Marion\u2019s flashbacks this week \u2013 a passionate kiss with a man and, later, a bath running. The Republican housemate, though, is an intriguing development. Cassie can barely contain her excitement. What\u2019s your take on the latest revelations? Who\u2019s in pole position to be the killer? Was it sex, drugs or the IRA that got David Walker killed? All theories very welcome below."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
