According to documents seen by the Guardian, the allegations have been made by Murdo Mackay, the former players' agent who was the club's director of football until last month, when he resigned after a power struggle. Mackay had fallen out badly with Jeremy Keith, the club's acting chief executive, and now alleges that after the 2003 takeover he, Keith and the club's finance director Andrew Mackenzie privately agreed that they would each receive \u00a3125,000 out of \u00a3375,000 which was paid to a consultancy company, Streamline Management, as a commission. Both Mackenzie and Keith firmly deny they received any money. Mackenzie said the \u00a3375,000 was paid to Streamline as a commission for introducing new finance to the club. Keith and two other men, John Sleightholme and Steve Harding, became Derby directors after the club was bought from administrative receivers for just \u00a33, backed by a \u00a315m loan from a Panamanian-registered company, ABC Corporation, which has a charge on Pride Park. A spokeswoman for Derbyshire Police told me: \"We can confirm that an allegation has been made about financial irregularities concerning Derby County Football Club.\" She stressed, however, that no formal investigation has yet been launched. \"Derbyshire Constabulary is making initial inquiries to ascertain whether there is any legitimacy to this allegation and whether any offence has taken place.\" Officers from the economic crime unit are understood to have talked to various people including Lionel Pickering, who owned the club before the \u00a33 takeover and lost millions when the Co-operative Bank put it into receivership. Mackenzie, who was Derby's finance director when Pickering owned the club and was then retained by the new owners, said of the \u00a3125,000: \"I refute the allegation in the strongest possible terms. Before the takeover, when the club was looking for money, Murdo Mackay put Streamline's name to me, saying they might assist. They got in touch with Jeremy Keith and he introduced ABC. Streamline were paid an agency or brokerage fee of \u00a3375,000.\" Keith also dismissed the story and suggested it has emerged now because Derby, currently drowning in \u00a345m of debts including a reported \u00a327m owed to the Co-operative Bank, are in the midst of another, bitter takeover battle. A consortium of local businessmen led by the housebuilding multi-millionaire Peter Gadsby, formerly the club's vice-chairman, are trying to cut a deal with the bank ahead of a London-based venture capital fund, SISU, who were introduced by Keith. \"The timing of these supposed allegations is no coincidence,\" Keith said. \"I have been subject to a sustained exercise to blacken my name by those with an agenda. Rumours have been put about that I have received secret profits from different sources.\" It has also been said of Keith that he is paid a commission on the \u00a31.5m annual interest paid to ABC, and that he made money when the striker Grzegorz Raziak was sold to Tottenham Hotspur last year. \"I categorically deny the receipt of secret profits,\" Keith said, referring to all these allegations. \"This matter is in the hands of my lawyers. This is a key time for the club as it is in a period of transition and my focus is to ensure it is effected as smoothly as possible.\" At Derby, the sunshine days of top-10 Premiership finishes and the 1997 move to a gleaming Pride Park, which seemed so emblematic of football's \"coming home\" rebirth, feel a long time ago. Pickering had owned Derby since the early 1990s but after the Fabrizio Ravanelli and Stefano Eranio-inspired years of joy, a ballooning wage bill and then relegation in 2002 sank the club into \u00a338m of debts, including nearly \u00a330m owed to the Co-operative Bank. In October 2003 the bank dramatically put the club into receivership, and within minutes it was sold to a company called Sharmine Limited, whose directors were Keith, Sleightholme and Harding, supported by the \u00a315m loan from ABC. Detail about the new ownership has emerged fitfully. Mackay, who had previously been involved in several failed companies, turned out to have been first engaged by Pickering when Derby's debts were beginning to bite. Mackay is understood to have been taken on to explore whether the club could terminate the contract of its then manager, John Gregory, and to help offload four of the high-earning players: Malcolm Christie, Danny Higginbotham, Mart Poom and Chris Riggott. After that Mackay was asked to help bring new finance to Derby. He says he introduced the club to Keith, a \"company doctor\" who finds finance for companies in trouble. The actual ownership of the club was only revealed a year later, when Sharmine Limited declared that its shares are held in the offshore tax havens of Belize and the British Virgin Islands. Subsequently Keith and Sleightholme - who became Derby's chairman - said that they owned them. The fans never warmed to this opaque takeover by people with no previous connection to Derby, or the Panamanian-registered ABC's loan which carries 10% interest, \u00a31.5m, a year. There have been persistent rumours that large commissions were paid when the deal was done, and it now seems clear that \u00a3375,000 was paid to Streamline Management. But further light is finding it difficult to shine. Streamline is a small company registered at the Sidcup office block of its accountants, Opass Billings Wilson &amp; Honey. In the documents seen by the Guardian, Mackay says that Streamline's owner and director, Mark Waters, who has several companies also registered to the same address, is \"a close friend and colleague\" and that Mackay arranged for the \u00a3375,000 to be paid via Streamline. Attempts to contact Waters via his accountants were not successful at the time of going to press, and it is not suggested that he or Streamline did anything improper. It was, according to Mackay, agreed to split the money three ways, which he believed was a legitimate commission. Mackenzie said the allegation has already been put to him within the club. \"I refuted it internally as well,\" he said. \"I had thought this allegation had gone away but it obviously hasn't. I'm going to take legal advice.\" Keith was adamant that the story had arisen to undermine him in the takeover battle raging over the club, which is floundering just two places above relegation from the Championship. Derby fans have in recent weeks been demonstrating for the board to go and are mostly backing the Gadsby consortium. \"We would prefer the club to be owned by local people whom we know - albeit they are multi-millionaires - to be genuine supporters,\" said James Wheeler of the supporters group, Ramstrust. \"The alternative, SISU, are a London-based venture capital company who want to buy the club to make money.\" A SISU spokesman confirmed the fund's plan is to buy the club, invest in it, reach the Premier League within five years and then sell it at a profit. He said a major advantage was that their deal would leave the club free of debt, because the Co-operative Bank will be asked to write off all its money. The spokesman also said SISU would work with local directors and that \"we would have a supporters' representative on the board because we believe there needs to be transparency\". Gadsby's consortium would not discuss the details of their bid, but it is understood that the club would be left with some loans and that they do not believe the bank will accept a complete write-off. However, Gadsby told me the takeover bid had nothing to do with the timing of the allegations emerging now. \"We certainly would not wish to do anything to bring further bad press on our football club,\" he said. He added that he and his partners are not in it to make money. \"No directors will be paid, any profits will be ploughed back in, and we don't envisage selling the club even if we do get to the Premier League, because, as many chairmen will attest, you put money into football rather than take it out.\" The winner will be announced shortly. We do not know how long the police might take.
