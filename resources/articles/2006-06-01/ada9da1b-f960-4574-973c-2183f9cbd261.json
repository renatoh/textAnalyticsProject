Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s: 1 (excellente) I am troubled by rise of Elen Rives, who appear daily in newspapers looking paralytic but fabulous. She need get cut down to size. \"I so sorry, Elen,\" I tell her. \"But if I trip over one more of your prams, I going to have to take an axe to it. And I think you need remember: I am the special one.\" \"That's not even your line,\" she hiss. \"So stay away from my buggy, Grandma.\" I storm back to room, where I need something keep my mind busy. I summon Coleen. \"Coleen,\" I purr. \"Remember in Dangerous Liaisons when Glenn Close make Uma Thurman into proper woman?\" \"I've not seen it,\" she admit. \"I liked her in 101 Dalmations though.\" \"I not seen that.

So, Uma Thurman she in love with Keanu Reeves.\" \"Like me and Wayne?\" Coleen ask. \"Very like that. But Glenn Close, she realise that to help Uma's education, it be good for her to meet John Malkovich. Make her bit more rounded, yes? This how I feel with you. I think I can teach you a lot.\" \"Thank you, Nancy,\" she say. \"What does this mean?\" \"It mean,\" I smile, \"that tomorrow I introduce you to my friend Gary Lineker.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
