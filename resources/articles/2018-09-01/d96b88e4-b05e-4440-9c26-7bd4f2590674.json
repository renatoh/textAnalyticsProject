The hearing was thrown into doubt when Ford\u2019s lawyers demanded an FBI investigation as a prerequisite to her appearance on Capitol Hill on Monday, setting up a showdown with the Senate judiciary committee chairman, Chuck Grassley. He said on Wednesday that the hearing would take place on Monday at 10am in Washington, as scheduled. In a letter to Ford\u2019s lawyers, he gave her until 10am Friday to submit her biography and prepared remarks \u201cif she intends to testify\u201d. \u201cI have reopened the hearing because I believe that anyone who comes forward with allegations of sexual assault has a right to be heard,\u201d Grassley said in the letter, referring back to Kavanaugh\u2019s original, tumultuous hearing earlier this month. He continued: \u201cYou have stated repeatedly that Dr Ford wants to tell her story. I sincerely hope that Dr Ford will accept my invitation to do so, either privately or publicly, on Monday.\u201d Republican Senate leaders postponed a committee vote on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination that was scheduled for Thursday. But by Wednesday afternoon, a handful of key Republican senators said they were prepared to move forward with Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination even if Ford chose not appear. \u201cI think it\u2019s not fair [to] Judge Kavanaugh for her not to come forward and testify,\u201d the Republican senator Susan Collins, seen as a decisive vote on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, told local radio station WVOM on Wednesday. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why the hearing shouldn\u2019t go forth.\u201d Ford, a research psychologist at Palo Alto University in northern California, has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her as a teen at a high school party \u2013 an allegation he has forcefully denied. In an interview with the Washington Post on Sunday, Ford said Kavanaugh had pinned her to a bed at a house party in the early 1980s and tried to remove her bathing suit. He allegedly placed his hand over her mouth to stifle her screams, she said, and she escaped only when a friend toppled them. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said it would be \u201cvery hard for me to imagine anything happened\u201d between Kavanaugh and Ford. But he said Ford \u201cdeserves\u201d to be heard and that he hopes she will share her story at a hearing on Monday. \u201cIf she shows up that would be wonderful, if she doesn\u2019t show up that would be unfortunate,\u201d he said, stating: \u201cIf she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and we\u2019ll have to make a decision.\u201d Speaking through lawyers on Tuesday night, Ford said she wanted to cooperate with the Senate judiciary committee but in effect ruled out appearing in front of the panel on Monday. Her lawyers said it would be premature to hold a hearing before an FBI investigation into her claims. The president and Republicans have rejected such calls. On Wednesday, the Department of Justice said Ford\u2019s allegation \u201cdoes not involve any potential federal crime\u201d. A spokesman for the department said the FBI had followed proper protocol, and forwarded a letter describing the incident to White House counsel, after receiving it last week. \u201cThe FBI does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation, the statement said, concluding: \u201cThe FBI\u2019s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers.\u201d In a separate letter to Democrats on the committee, Grassley said he had offered to fly his staff to \u201cCalifornia or anywhere else\u201d to interview her. In a tersely worded letter that blamed Democrats for failing to shield Ford\u2019s identity from the public, Grassley revealed that Republican staff had \u201csought to set up\u201d interviews with three alleged witnesses, including Mark Judge, a classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s who Ford said was present but has said he has no recollection of the incident and does not want to testify publicly about it. Republicans and the president have targeted the Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein for not informing the committee of the allegation sooner. Feinstein, the ranking member on the Senate judiciary committee, received a letter from Ford in July outlining the alleged incident. She said she did not reveal its contents out of respect for Ford\u2019s request for confidentiality. That changed when her name leaked last week. \u201cPresident Trump,\u201d Feinstein said in a tweet on Wednesday, \u201cDr Blasey Ford did not want her story of sexual assault to be public. She requested confidentiality and I honored that. It wasn\u2019t until the media outed her that she decided to come forward. You may not respect women and the wishes of victims, but I do.\u201d In a letter from Ford\u2019s lawyers to the Senate panel on Tuesday night, they say her life has been \u201cturned upside down\u201d since she went public with the allegations. She had received \u201cvicious harassment and even death threats\u201d and her family was forced to relocate from their home, the lawyers said. On Capitol Hill, Kavanaugh\u2019s supporters suggested Ford may have \u201cmistaken\u201d the identity of her attacker. \u2019\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
