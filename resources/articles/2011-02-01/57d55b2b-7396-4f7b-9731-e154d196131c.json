McNamara held talks over the winter with the 21-year-old scrum-half and his agent, as did the Rugby Football League chief executive, Nigel Wood. But for at least a fortnight it has been a question of when, rather than if, Eastmond's move to Bath will be confirmed. With the player's relationship with Saints' supporters now apparently tarnished beyond repair, after a series of hesitant performances, the answer now seems likely to be sooner rather than later. That is arguably a greater blow to country than club, as Eastmond had long been identified as the sort of attacking talent that England desperately need if they are to re-establish international credibility. He was fast-tracked into the national team by McNamara's predecessor, Tony Smith, in the 2009 Four Nations, when his half-back partnership with Wigan's Sam Tomkins showed real promise. Now, with Tomkins operating at full-back for Wigan, McNamara is left to search for a new pair of playmakers. He has responded by calling up Danny Brough, the maverick Huddersfield scrum-half whose only international experience has come with Scotland \u2013 as their captain in the 2008 World Cup and most recently in a European Cup game in France last autumn, when they were attempting to qualify for the Four Nations. McNamara has also recalled Leon Pryce, Eastmond's experienced St Helens half-back partner who has yet to play this season because of a groin injury, more than two years since his last international appearance, in the ill-fated 2008 World Cup campaign. Paul Prescott and Michael McIlorum, two young Wigan forwards who played in Sunday's World Club Challenge defeat by the St George Illawarra Dragons, have been persuaded to switch allegiances from Ireland, for whom they qualified, like Brough for Scotland, through ancestry. Three members of last autumn's Four Nations squad \u2013 the Wigan wing Darrell Goulding, Warrington centre Ryan Atkins and Huddersfield hooker Shaun Lunt \u2013 have been relegated to the second-string England Knights squad. Four players have been dropped completely. Age has counted against the experienced props Stuart Fielden and Garreth Carvell; Kevin Brown and Darrell Griffin of Huddersfield are more surprising omissions. Other significant inclusions are the in-form Leeds outside back Ben Jones-Bishop, the young Hull KR prop Liam Watts and Brett Ferres of Castleford. Luke Gale's contribution to Harlequins' successful start to the season is recognised with a place in the Knights squad.
