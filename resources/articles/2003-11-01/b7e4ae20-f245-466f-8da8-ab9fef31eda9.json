Sunderland yesterday announced annual losses of \u00a321m, bringing their overall debts to around \u00a336m. The PLC chairman Bryan Sanderson was quick to identify the manager McCarthy's predecessors, first Peter Reid and then Howard Wilkinson, as the major culprits for the club's demise as expensive failed investments in the likes of Tore Andre Flo, Marcus Stewart, Emerson Thome and Julio Arca backfired with disastrous financial consequences. On the pitch Gillingham served as a chilling reminder of when Sunderland fell on hard times in a previous era. The debts were not as high back in 1987, but Lawrie McMenemy's Sunderland were relegated to the old Third Division for the first time in their history as Gillingham sent them down with victory over two legs in the first year of the play-offs. McCarthy, with an air of a man on message in political fashion, chose to hail a \"great day\" for the club. \"A tough day? Not for us. We've had a great day. I've just travelled 300 miles and watched my side win the game comprehensively,\" he said. \"If the financial situation has affected us then maybe there should be more announcements if it means we can keep getting results like that.\" Sunderland ended a barren period of over five hours with their three strikes, which moved them into the top four of Division One. \"Goal famine? You can call it that if you want but I just told my players to keep going at it and eventually we would score,\" said McCarthy. Gillingham took the lead in the 37th minute through Paul Shaw but Sunderland soon responded to equalise. John Oster's searching right-wing cross reached the on-loan Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing, who volleyed viciously into the top righthand corner. In the 58th minute Downing and Oster performed a role reversal with the impressive Downing providing a leftsided cross from the byline for Oster to blast in the second at the far post. Marcus Stewart added a third in the 71st minute when he prodded in a low cross from Oster. Gillingham's player-manager Hessenthaler, whose side are still suffering from the untimely onset of a flu virus, said: \"If we can afford some flu jabs next year then we will have them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
