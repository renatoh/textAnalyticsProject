He is a supremely gifted musician. And it's possible that Shelter From the Ash, the first of Chasny's own records to find its way to these ears, may not be his best. But it's hard to fight the feeling that what you're listening to is not pushing forward the boundaries of music but instead resembles a kind of acid-folk Spinal Tap for hipsters. Although there are moments of striking beauty here, the guitar sounds become repetitive, and Chasny's vocal is not particularly convincing. There is a cumulative, stoned appeal, but also a worrying feeling that Chasny is too conscious of how, like, cosmic his playing is, without the chromatic sophistication to back it up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
