The David Beckham 'package' is an advertiser's dream. How much is Beckham, as a footballing and marketing phenomenon, worth? On top of the \u00a370,000 Manchester United stuff in to Beckham's paypacket, the club pays \u00a320,000 a week for use of his image on its merchandise, programmes and promotional material. But he earns around a whopping \u00a310m a year from endorsing products and services including Adidas (\u00a33m); Marks and Spencer (\u00a33m); Vodafone (\u00a31m ); Pepsi (\u00a32m); BP's Castrol (\u00a3500,000). A new \u00a34m contract with purfumier Coty is on the cards and then there are overseas endorsements including toiletries and clothing lines in the Far East. What effect will Beckham's departure have on Manchester United, financially ? Business analysts FutureBrand believes almost all of United's sources of revenue would be unaffected if Beckham was sold for \u00a330m this summer. Ticket sales are unlikely to be affected - Old Trafford, like Highbury, is always sold out and cash from the sale of Premiership and international TV rights would remain unchanged as they are negotiated centrally by the League. TV rights contribute about 36% of United's revenue. The Premier League brings in \u00a335m, domestic cups \u00a30.6m and the Champions League \u00a310.4m. Vodafone's \u00a38m-per-year sponsorship of the club would not be affected, neither would Nike's \u00a323m-a-year, 13-year deal. A lot has been said and written about the merchandising value of Beckham abroad, particularly in the Far East. There could be some erosion of the club's Asian fan-base - which accounts for up to 30% of the club's total fans - but this would be amply accounted for by the \u00a330m sale fee. United have always been wary of one player becoming bigger from the club and take measures to protect themselves, insisting for example, that three players are featured in photo shoots. What effect will Beckham's departure from Manchester United have on English football, financially? Premier League bosses may be as keen to keep Beckham in the country as tabloid editors who rely on his pictures to sell papers. Demand for international TV rights to the Premiership could be adversely affected by Beckham's exit from English football because fans often follow foreign teams on the strength of certain personalities. What could Beckham bring to his new club, financially? Beckham would boost the Asian fanbase for whatever continental club he signed for. He has a huge and fanatical following in Asia eager for Beckham shirts and endorsed goods. On the day the Manchester United's new Nike strip was launched it was available in 58 countries with the club selling more of Beckham's No7 shirts than any other player's. The publicity Beckham's presence at a new club would generate - through both his football and his private life - would be worth a fortune alone. And the pull of one of European football's top stars would attract advertisers to the club he eventually signs for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
