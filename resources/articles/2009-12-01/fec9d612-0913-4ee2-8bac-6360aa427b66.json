Ancelotti has lost only two of his 21 competitive games in charge, establishing a five-point lead in the Premier League and winning the club's Champions League group with a game to spare, which suggests he has found the move to English football after eight years at Milan something of a breeze. It is virtually a year to the day since Luiz Felipe Scolari's impressive start at Stamford Bridge began to peter out \u2013 the league leadership was lost in the first week of December and never regained \u2013 with Wilkins, the Brazilian's No2 and retained by the new regime, acknowledging Ancelotti's ability to see the funny side in what remains a hugely pressurised job. That, in effect, has helped the players warm to the new man in charge. \"I've been extremely impressed from a personal point of view,\" said Wilkins. \"As a bloke, he's a really funny guy, always joke telling. I have to translate, unfortunately, if he wants to crack into something quite humorous. But he tells the players jokes and seems to enjoy their company. He's dealt with the players in fantastic fashion on a personal basis, and we're seeing the rewards of that out on the pitch. That humour could well be one of the reasons he's been so successful as a manager in the game. \"He knows the time and the place for it. In the dressing room, in team talks and tactics, it's business time. But you can tell he's dealt with top quality footballers. A lot passed through his hands at Milan over those eight years, and he's walked into a similar situation here. Albeit with the language barrier to cope with, too. But he's treated our guys the same as he treated his players at Milan. Back in pre-season, we were on tour with Milan in the United States and you could see the respect, to a player, the Milan guys all had for him. That's continued here. The way he treats guys on a personal level, I'm sure he's got the utmost respect from every one of them.\" \"Ancelotti is the best coach in the world,\" said Didier Drogba, whose own form has soared under the 49-year-old. \"He arrived at a new place with players he didn't know and a staff that wasn't his own. Despite all this, he settled in quickly. He is a winner. I love the way he manages the team, the calmness he can convey to us. We work a lot under him, but with a smile on our faces as he can be funny too \u2013 both in training and in the dressing room where a nice atmosphere has developed.\" Chelsea are clearly wiser from the experiences of last season, when Scolari struggled to arrest a decline that saw him slip from the top of the table to the sack within two months mid-season. \"At this stage last year, there were a few hiccups round the corner,\" said Wilkins. \"We have to make sure they don't creep in this year. We're going great guns at the moment, but things can change on anything in football. Not a lot actually went wrong last year, to be honest. It was fine lines. The last game under Felipe was against Hull and we drew (0-0), but how many chances did we have in that game? \"That's not down to luck. This year we're putting the ball in the goal. Last year it just went past the post. That's not luck. That was a technical blip on the player who didn't score the goal. But this year, they're going in. Carlo has been calm about the two defeats we've had, and he's relayed that calmness to the players and got a reaction. We know there are going to be games when things don't go our way \u2013 for the first 20 minutes against Arsenal on Sunday, it wasn't our game \u2013 but we dig in. To a man, these guys are prepared to do that.\" Ancelotti will rotate his squad for tomorrow's Carling Cup quarter-final against Blackburn Rovers, with the likes of Drogba and Nicolas Anelka likely to be rested and Ga\u00ebl Kakuta included among the substitutes. \"It is important for a manager to get that first trophy under his belt,\" added Wilkins. \"Carlo seems quite determined to win the Carling Cup, so the team he puts out at Blackburn will have a lot of strong quality.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
