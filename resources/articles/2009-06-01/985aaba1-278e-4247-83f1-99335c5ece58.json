His dedication to the sport of racing and to the highest standards knew no bounds. It is humbling to follow in his footsteps.\" It was poignant that Vincent O'Brien should die in Derby week as it was the Epsom Classic \u2013 the blue riband event of Flat racing \u2013 where he proved himself the master of his craft, winning the race six times between 1962 and 1982 by producing champion colts such as Sir Ivor and Nijinsky. He was soon known as the Master of Ballydoyle, from where the unrelated Aidan O'Brien will send out six of the 13 runners down to contest Saturday's Derby. \"We would never have been able to achieve our successes without the facility and gallops he built,\" O'Brien said. \"There is nothing that compares to it anywhere in the world.\" Vincent O'Brien stepped up to the far more lucrative Flat racing on the back of spectacular training successes over the jumps, winning the Grand National three years in a row from 1953 with three different horses and sweeping all before him at the Cheltenham National Hunt Festival, where he ran up hat\u2011tricks in both the Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle. The veteran broadcaster Sir Peter O'Sullevan, a lifelong friend, rates O'Brien as the greatest trainer ever. \"His achievements were absolutely unparalleled, not just for a 20th-century training career but of all time. To win three successive Grand Nationals and four Gold Cups ... amazing. \"The great thing about him was that he was so meticulous and so dedicated. He was a real stickler for detail and for the right details. He was a master of his craft.\" O'Brien's swan-song triumph came in the US Breeders' Cup Mile in 1990, when he saddled Royal Academy to a last\u2011stride victory under an almost equally veteran Lester Piggott, who rode four of O'Brien's Derby winners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
