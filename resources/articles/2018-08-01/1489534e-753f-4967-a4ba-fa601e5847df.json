The four-times Super League champions confirmed on Wednesday that Edwards, who had 14 phenomenally successful years as a player, would rejoin the club after fulfilling his union commitments with Wales around the Rugby World Cup in Japan next year. The former Wigan scrum-half Adrian Lam will take interim charge in 2019. Edwards, who was presented to the media by the club on Thursday, said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a three- or four-year deal with Wigan, but I\u2019d have guaranteed employment for the next 10 to 15 years in union. In the long term I could be at a financial risk. I\u2019ve taken a risk to come here but the reason I\u2019ve done that is to challenge for trophies with Wigan. \u201cIt was time to have a crack at rugby league. Ian [Lenagan, the Wigan owner] offered me the opportunity and it just felt like the right time to come back. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d come back and start preaching about how to make rugby league better, either. I\u2019m back to help my team win games: it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d Edwards also insisted his commitment to Wales meant there was little chance of him walking away from rugby union before the World Cup next year \u2013 and reiterated he is relaxed with the arrangement with Lam taking charge of Wigan for 12 months before he assumes control for the 2020 season. \u201cMy commitment to the Welsh public meant I was going to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve accepted me as one of their own and it\u2019ll be nice to finish off at the World Cup in 2019 with a bang.\u201d Edwards will use his spare time away from his Wales commitments to observe Wigan from afar before taking charge. \u201cI will try to be involved. I\u2019m hoping to do some consultancy work with Ospreys outside of my international commitments, although when the internationals are on it\u2019s absolutely full-on \u2013 you\u2019re with Wales full-time. \u201cBut later in the weeks outside of that, I\u2019ll be driving up to Wigan and watching training. I won\u2019t be doing any coaching, though, it will be all over to Adrian. We will speak on the phone regularly but he\u2019s the boss during his period in charge.\u201d Edwards joined Wigan aged 17 and between 1983 and 1997 became the English game\u2019s most decorated player with eight league titles and nine Challenge Cups. London Broncos upset Widnes London Broncos ensured the Qualifiers began with an upset on Thursday when they went to Widnes and won 21-20 thanks to a Jarrod Sammut drop goal in the last minute. It was the only third time in 17 Qualifier games that a Championship side have beaten a Super League team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
