They also pose big questions around how journalists and editors handle graphic detail and court rulings. The Millane case sparked intense public interest in New Zealand, including public vigils, international media attention and widespread public comment. A 27-year-old man was convicted of her murder. The man\u2019s name and details that may identify him remain suppressed. New Zealand, like many other countries, has strict rules around what can be reported in criminal trials. Details, including names, faces, prior convictions or concurrent charges, even testimony, are often suppressed. Once an accused has been charged there is little that can be reported. To imply \u2013 or outright say \u2013 a suspect did it after they have pleaded not guilty could land someone in contempt of court, or worse, cause a mistrial. But in the internet age, those rules are getting harder and harder to enforce, and harder and harder to understand. Name suppression in particular is common. Each time it is used in a high-profile case, it sparks a conversation about whether it is overused, and how to keep those details off the internet. There\u2019s often a sense that its unfairly applied, depending on the wealth, ethnicity, or fame of the people involved. In the Millane case, perhaps in anger at the suppression itself, people have continued to share suppressed details online. Police have warned against such behaviour, and the justice minister, Andrew Little, has said he understands police and the courts will be looking into such situations. At the same time, there has been criticism of how much was reported from court, despite those details forming key parts of the prosecution or defence case. People have felt it was too graphic, too much detail, unfair on the victim and her family. But court reporting must provide a fair, balanced, and accurate picture of what happened in court. The principle of open justice is one the media holds very dear, and it\u2019s important for all citizens that it\u2019s upheld. The media isn\u2019t meant to be in court to generate clicks, it\u2019s there as the eyes and ears of the public, even when it feels like the detail is hard to stomach. Nonetheless, these cases raise impossible questions for journalists and editors. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, made international headlines when she refused to say the name of the man accused of the Christchurch attacks. But his name has not been suppressed by the courts. Despite that, when RNZ, the country\u2019s public broadcaster, has used the accused\u2019s name, we\u2019ve had feedback from the audience that they think the outlet is breaking the law. Far more common are people who understand it\u2019s not illegal but believe that the impact of using his name is glorifying or destructive. Some people have chosen to avoid his name entirely. The mayor of Christchurch has gone so far as to claim she had \u201cno idea\u201d what the name of the accused is. The media in New Zealand have agreed to protocols on covering the Christchurch trial, which is due to begin in June. Those protocols don\u2019t cover his name. Each organisation will make a decision on that on their own, often on a story-by-story basis. These are the things that keep me up at night. My worst nightmare is reporting that creates a mistrial in one of these cases \u2013 not because of the fine that would ensue, but because victims deserve their day in court and the accused has the right to mount their defence. Seeing overseas media reporting or social media comments on these cases which bend, or outright break, the rules, is frustrating not because we\u2019ve been \u201cscooped,\u201d but because they\u2019re jeopardising a fair trial. When the judge lifted the suppression on the photo of the Christchurch accused, my colleagues and I went back and forth for an hour about whether to use it. It might seem like blanket rules are easy to make, but each story and each organisation is different, and there\u2019s not one right answer. We have obligations to the law, to victims, to the public, and ultimately, to the truth. New Zealand is a tiny country and in some ways it feels like major crimes happen to everyone. These two cases occupied the public discourse, and traumatised communities. They raise impossible questions for everyone involved. It can be hard to put emotion aside, as the judge in the Millane trial ordered jurors, and think about what constitutes a fair trial. But we all should.
