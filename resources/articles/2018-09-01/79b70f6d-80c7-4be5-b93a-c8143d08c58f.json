The midfielder had endured a tough time during England\u2019s defeat to Spain on Saturday, and was substituted before the end, but as he spoke in the bowels of Wembley almost every remark finished with a grin. \u201cOverall I thought in the second half we were better\u201d was one such moment. \u201cAs the game went on we created more chances and we were disappointed not to get the [equalising] goal that was disallowed. There is a lot to improve on but also a lot of positives to take.\u201d Then out came the full beam. Perhaps there was a private reason for Henderson\u2019s happiness, or maybe he is just an easygoing guy. But it was not difficult to find his attitude reassuring; England had been beaten by Luis Enrique\u2019s new-look side but there was no shame in defeat, especially not if the necessary lessons are learned. \u201cWe still feel confident,\u201d Henderson said, a reminder that England\u2019s World Cup showing during the summer puts a Nations League defeat in perspective. \u201cWe still feel like we are learning. We have a lot of young players in the team. You want to play against the best teams and the best players to learn from the experiences. Spain are definitely that. We will look back on the game at what we can do better and what we did well, then move on to the Switzerland game which is another good test.\u201d In repeating messages about learning and improving, Henderson chimed with the manager. The smiling Liverpool captain has, like the rest of this England squad, signed up fully to Gareth Southgate\u2019s project. Both parties have a very recent benchmark from which to draw confidence. Furthermore, England may have lost three competitive matches in a row, each against teams they consider their rivals, but they have given each of them a game; the margins are not huge. Against Spain the visitors had more possession, more successful passes, a higher pass completion rate, etc. But the gap was not breathtaking (England hit 437 successful passes to Spain\u2019s 574). Moreover, Spain were set up to maintain possession while England were not. The home side wanted to play directly, to move the ball quickly up the field. A good example of how this style might work effectively, even against the highest calibre opposition, came in the build-up to Marcus Rashford\u2019s goal, in which Henderson played a part. That\u2019s the style that England are currently aspiring to (one consistent with the FA\u2019s England DNA initiative). With several chances created in open play, there were signs of progress in this endeavour from England\u2019s midfield of Henderson, Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard. The more concerning question in this match was about what happened when England didn\u2019t have the ball. \u201cIt was tough. Especially in the first half\u201a\u201c Henderson added. \u201cWe maybe tried to press a little bit too high at times, which we have been working on during the week, but it was difficult for the full-backs to get out to theirs because they were quite deep. It left a lot of space, especially in the middle, and when you are playing in a three you are covering a lot of ground. But we talked at half-time and I thought we improved.\u201d Henderson insisted he would not have wanted another midfield anchor to mop up alongside him and Southgate has shown that he does not see Henderson and Eric Dier playing together in this team. At Wembley, however, the need appeared to be less for a gifted playmaker (the subject of so much summer conversation) than someone who could get from box to box. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is suited to that role but will remain out of the picture through injury for some time yet. Other options carry question marks, such as Spurs\u2019s Harry Winks (does he have the physicality), Nathaniel Chalobah (can he play consistently at the highest level?) or even Ruben Loftus-Cheek (he appears to have the skillset, but it is not his current position). Instead of change, there is also the possibility that Southgate chooses to persist with the midfield as is. For all that, Henderson was left exposed at times and had cause to berate both Alli and Lingard, teammates who are learning, too. Lingard and Alli first played together in this system against Nigeria in June. Neither are ideally suited to the role, but both are showing a willingness to adapt and, you could argue, are moving in the right direction. Lingard in particular did great work helping the right hand side of England\u2019s defence against Spain, somewhat stifling the influence of both Isco and Marcos Alonso. With the national team on a learning curve and the trust between squad and coach so apparent, Southgate would be justified in giving his midfield time to learn more yet. If the World Cup in Russia saw a revolution in England\u2019s behaviour, evolution may be the watchword from now on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
