Willie Mullins, the trainer O\u2019Leary abandoned in the summer in a dispute over training fees, had won 11 of the 18 races to that point and so, as three of the horses O\u2019Leary removed from the yard galloped towards the last in the Grade One Lexus Chase on Wednesday, with the Mullins-trained favourite in hot pursuit, he could be forgiven for fearing the worst. \u201cHaving three days of seeing my colours finish down at the other end of the parade ring, any one of them would have done fine,\u201d O\u2019Leary said afterwards, \u201cbut I thought coming to the last that they\u2019d all fall after the week we\u2019re having here.\u201d Instead it was Outlander, a Grade One winner for Mullins at this track last February, who stayed on strongly to win the meeting\u2019s feature event for his new trainer, Gordon Elliott, with Don Poli, another horse that made the same move, second. Mullins\u2019 Djakadam, the 5-4 favourite, was third, with Valseur Lido, who left Mullins to join Henry de Bromhead, back in fourth. When the split between Mullins and O\u2019Leary\u2019s Gigginstown Stud bloodstock operation was announced in late September, many doubted that an issue as mundane as training fees could account for it. In fact, many still do, the suggestion being that O\u2019Leary did not enjoy being just one major owner among several at the Mullins stable. He wanted to be the undisputed top dog. O\u2019Leary, though, insisted on Wednesday that the breakdown in professional relations between owner and trainer was all down to money. Billionaires do not normally jib at the cost of a first-class ticket, never mind when it is only a little more expensive than flying economy, but O\u2019Leary, it seems, is an exception. \u201cIt\u2019s business,\u201d O\u2019Leary said of the split in which Mullins, Ireland\u2019s champion trainer, lost 60 horses overnight. \u201cI have loads of horses and plenty of other trainers, and Willie has other owners. I don\u2019t mind spending lots of money on the horses but I want to keep the training fees down. \u201cWillie\u2019s a genius of a trainer, that\u2019s not news to anybody, and he\u2019s demonstrated here all week what a good trainer he is. But Gordon is a good trainer, Henry is a good trainer. These are business decisions. People write it up like it\u2019s someone died in the family and it isn\u2019t. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m not having many winners at Leopardstown this week is that Willie is winning them all, or nearly all. But he\u2019s a great trainer and a gentleman and I\u2019m sorry that he doesn\u2019t have horses for me [any more] but hopefully he will again in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re weaker without Willie. I\u2019d like to say that Willie was weaker without us but it\u2019s not looking like it this week.\u201d Outlander\u2019s victory was a big moment for Jack Kennedy, his 17-year-old jockey, who was recording the 100th winner of his career and also his first in a Grade One race. However, the form was some way below the standard set by Thistlecrack, the King George VI Chase winner, two days earlier, and Outlander is a 20-1 outsider to win the Gold Cup at Cheltenham in March. \u201cValseur Lido was outstayed by the others, so we might go back to the Ryanair [Chase] with him,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cI think Outlander has shown today that he is a Gold Cup horse and hopefully Don Poli as well if he retains his enthusiasm. He is entitled to go for a Gold Cup but the standard of the race is going to be quite high, so we\u2019ll throw a few at it.\u201d Earlier on the card, Mullins had maintained the exceptional run of form that started with three winners here on Monday and continued with another five on Tuesday. He ended the day with four more victories, giving him 12 in all from 21 races, and also another Grade One success, thanks to Vroum Vroum Mag\u2019s one-and-a-quarter length win in the three-mile Christmas Hurdle. The Stayers\u2019 Hurdle is now a very plausible target for Vroum Vroum Mag but she was noticeably keen for much of Wednesday\u2019s race and has alternatives at Cheltenham in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle, which she won last season, and possibly even the Ryanair Chase as she went unbeaten in six starts over fences in 2014 and 2015. The Champion Hurdle may also be an option if either or both of Faugheen and Annie Power, the last two winners of the race for their trainer, fail to make it to the starting line. \u201cShe\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d Mullins said. \u201cShe works with our Champion Hurdle horses, we know she gets three miles now, she can jump hurdles or go over fences, so she\u2019s the sort of supersub in the Ricci team and that\u2019s how she\u2019ll be campaigned. \u201cWe\u2019ll put her in wherever we think she can win at Cheltenham, all being well. She\u2019s a unique mare.\u201d Mullins took the wraps off yet another possible contender for championship honours at Cheltenham in March when Bleu Et Rouge produced an exceptional turn of foot from a deeply unpromising position two out to win the card\u2019s Beginners\u2019 Chase. Barry Geraghty still had at least five lengths to find turning for home but coaxed an irresistible run from Bleu Et Rouge, who got up to beat Gangster \u2013 yet another of O\u2019Leary\u2019s ex-Mullins contingent \u2013 by three-quarters of a length. \u201cHe schools well at home but he didn\u2019t bring that to the track,\u201d Mullins said. \u201cI think he got a fright at the first and then he continued to frighten himself the whole way until the third-last. I still thought he\u2019d lost too much ground at the last to win the race but then it was as if he\u2019d just joined in. He\u2019ll need a bit more schooling but he\u2019s a nice one.\u201d Mullins also reflected on his golden run of form this week after a slow start to the season following the departure of O\u2019Leary\u2019s horses. \u201cLast week, I was hoping that [Tuesday\u2019s winner] Douvan might get there but I was hoping that we wouldn\u2019t have a bad meeting,\u201d Mullins said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had a very, very slow [start to the] year, even by our standards and it\u2019s just picking up nicely now, so I\u2019m delighted. \u201cWe had a very dry autumn this year and we\u2019re normally slow to get going but that\u2019s the only reason I could say, and probably the loss of half the yard as well. But we\u2019ve a great team at home. It\u2019s all about keeping your horses in order and your people in order and trying to have them right for the big meetings \u2013 and that seems to have worked. \u201cIt was a blow, obviously, you hate losing a group of horses like that but that\u2019s the way, everyone has got to do what they want to do and that\u2019s the way it was.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
