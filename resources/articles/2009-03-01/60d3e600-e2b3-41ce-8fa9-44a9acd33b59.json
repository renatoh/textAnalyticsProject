The lengthy title reflects the former international athlete's importance to Barclays. Jenkins, an expert in tax planning, is no longer involved in day-to-day operations of the division after being promoted to chairman of Middle East operations last year. It was his contacts which helped Barclays avoid taking the UK taxpayer bailout last year and instead raise funds from Middle Eastern governments. He has had two stints at Barclays, his current tenure having begun in 1994. He is married to Diana, a Bosnian who came to study at City University, London. There she wrote a paper called \"Minimising Withholding Taxes in a Multinational Corporate Structure\" \u2013 a possible topic for healthy debates with her husband."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
