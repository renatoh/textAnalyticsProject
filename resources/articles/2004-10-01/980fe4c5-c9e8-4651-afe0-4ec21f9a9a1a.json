Walker left the company, now known as Big Food Group, in January 2001 amid allegations that he had sold part of his shareholding ahead of a shock profits warning issued by his new chief executive, Bill Grimsey, still head of BFG. Walker is now free to make a bid to acquire part of the Iceland supermarket chain if retail investment group Baugur makes a formal offer for Big Food Group at the end of due diligence, which is now taking place. A letter was sent to Walker's lawyers, Clifford Chance, to confirm that the investigation is closed. No charges will be brought against anybody. Walker said that the experience had been very difficult. 'You are blighted,' he said. 'It gets sensationalised and everybody knows about it. Mud sticks.' He criticised the SFO for taking almost four years to clear him while he lived under 'a cloud of rumour and innuendo'. He said he never had 'the slightest doubt' that he would be totally vindicated. 'I decided to sell part of my shareholding [in late 2000] because I was retiring from my executive role in the company, and the sale was duly authorised by the non-executive directors of the company and the incoming management team. 'My lawyers advised long ago that I had a clear and categorical defence, based on apparently undisputed facts, against any accusation that I had acted improperly or unlawfully.' Walker set up a new frozen food business, CoolTrader, with his former finance director, Andy Pritchard, in 2001. There will be 24 shops by the end of this year, all in the north west, which are backed by venture capital firm Gresham. Walker says that like-for-like sales are 'impressive'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
