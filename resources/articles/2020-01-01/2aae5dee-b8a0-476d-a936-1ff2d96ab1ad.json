The 25-year-old American has told BBC Sport that during the first half of Palace\u2019s 3-2 Championship defeat a group of fans shouted the referee should \u201ccheck the gender\u201d of Palace players. Calling for action, she said: \u201cIn my 18 years of playing I\u2019ve never had verbal abuse directly aimed at myself right behind my goal. It was an unpleasant experience. If it was a racist comment it wouldn\u2019t be tolerated. We have had players walk off pitches for racist comments. Maybe I should have walked off the pitch in that match.\u201d In a statement Coventry said they were aware of the allegations\u201d and were looking into them. \u201cWe are investigating the matter carefully, with the close support of the Football Association. Until the investigations are complete, CUFC staff or players will be making no further comment.\u201d Gillett, who joined Palace from the Women\u2019s Super League side Brighton last summer, said the abuse came from a group of about eight men behind her goal, which she reported to the referee at half-time. \u201cAt the time I wasn\u2019t 100% sure of the protocol or what I was supposed to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to just ignore it and continue with the game. \u201cThe behaviour was better in the second half but still not completely controlled and quite intimidating for the team. \u201cI can\u2019t say what should have happened or shouldn\u2019t have happened, but for me to be verbally abused for 45 minutes \u2013 to anyone that is unacceptable. \u201cIf we are going to see more of these incidents in the women\u2019s game then there needs to be protocols of what teams and security should be doing if they come across this kind of situation.\u201d The FA said it is looking into the incident and is \u201ccommitted to tackling homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in football at every level of the game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
