Entitled Cachaito, it was a Buena Vista Social Club spin-off that ricocheted in a surprisingly contemporary direction. As a marquee full of world-music fans cheered Cachaito's loose assemblage of jazz-reggae-descarga, the musicians looked as if they couldn't believe their luck. This time around, playing the Royal Festival Hall as part of the La Linea festival, their bearing is supremely confident. As before, their show starts like a movie, taking its time to introduce a cast of different musical characters. The stage is empty but for a voluptuous-looking double bass. We hear the taped telephone conversation of Siempre con Swing, then Lopez walks on to play a long cadenza. As he moves into the distinctive riff of Redencion, the musicians troop on and ease into the loping groove. Policarpo \"Polo\" Tamayo, a diminutive man in a blue suit and beret, plays the sensuous flute part. A bass solo ends with a musical dialogue with brilliant conguero Miguel \"Anga\" Diaz, who also takes care of most of the spoken introductions. Each player is shown in his best light. Rafael \"Jimmy\" Jenks's sax solos and lead lines have great authority; guitarist Manuel Galban adds drama; trumpeter Yaure Muniz gives a lovely reading of Tumbanga, the tune Lopez wrote with Hugh Masekela. After a big build-up, saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis strolls on playing a Caribbean tune. Bigga Morrison pumps restrained Hammond chops through an old Leslie speaker and gets a chance to play to the gallery with a swaggering, quote-laden organ solo. By the time they charge into Tumbao No 5 (Para Charlie Mingus), all the players seem like old friends. On the scratchy Cachaito in Laboratory, Morrison coaxes the audience to chant: \"Yeah man - Si, si senor.\" All the while the distinguished, besuited Lopez smiles his statesman's smile and maintains that big steady pulse with his three percussionists. Occasionally he nods with pleasure, as if to say, \"What a great band! What a great life!\" But he never says a word, just lets his eloquent bass do all the talking."}, "isHosted": false}}}
