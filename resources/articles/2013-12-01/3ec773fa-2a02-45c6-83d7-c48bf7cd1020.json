Senior ministers believe that Lady Warsi, who was sacked last year as Tory party chairman, is writing a diary that will include observations from around the cabinet table. The coalition is yet to be rocked by an indiscreet political expose, a regular occurrence under the last Labour government, but the behaviour of the outspoken Tory peer during meetings has become a hot topic among colleagues, the Observer understands. \"She sits in cabinet and just writes furiously throughout,\" said one government source. \"She doesn't even look up. It looks like everything is going down.\" It is understood that the subject has been raised at the highest levels of government. Warsi was replaced as party chairman by Grant Shapps in September last year, despite making a public appeal to keep her job. \"I'm a woman, I'm not white, I'm from an urban area, I'm from the north, I'm working class \u2013 I kind of fit the bill,\" she told one interviewer. But she ultimately fell victim to a whispering campaign over her perceived failure to rally members in the constituencies, along with strident calls for her removal by the influential activists' website, ConservativeHome. Warsi was so dismayed when she was sacked that she immediately left London for her family home in Yorkshire, it was reported, only for negotiations over her future role to continue by telephone. She eventually took a job in the Foreign Office as a senior minister of state responsible for Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, faith and the UN. Some are now thought to be worried that the publication of a diary by a former cabinet member would expose the coalition's inner workings. A spokesman for Warsi said he had no idea whether she was writing a diary and declined to comment any further."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
