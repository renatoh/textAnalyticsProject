Victory may have extended the national team's winning start to five games at the top of Group Six, but the Italian admitted this had been his \"most anxious\" game since becoming England head coach. The Italian put his side's lethargic second-half performance last night down to a lack of freshness associated with this stage of a draining Premier League campaign and was grateful for his captain, John Terry, conjuring a left-footed finish from close-range to secure the narrow win. Much may have been unconvincing with this display but there was resilience to admire here and admirable perseverance in pursuit of a winner after Andriy Shevchenko's equaliser. England retain a five-point advantage over Croatia in the group. \"That was my most anxious game, yes, and when the referee blew the whistle I was very happy,\" said Capello. \"I said we need to 'win ugly' sometimes and we did. We lost easy passes, the final ball, too much. At this period of the season, though, the players are not so fresh and they can lose passes when you have to play quickly. They pressured us, too, and there was not much space to play. But I'm happy with the application and character all the players showed. They played like a group, and I like this. You can only succeed if you play like a team. That's so important.\" Capello reserved special praise for his captain, claiming Terry had shown the \"strong character\" that made him a natural leader after a difficult week in which his mother and mother-in-law had been arrested on suspicion of shop-lifting. Yet the Italian was quick to shrug off any concerns that Wayne Rooney's rash \u2013 if unpunished \u2013 challenge on Oleksandr Aliyev just after the hour-mark might have been deemed dangerous. \"The referee said he got the ball,\" added Capello, who had jokingly described the striker as a \"crazy man\" last week. \"What happened? Nothing. It was a normal tackle. We need strong tackles sometimes.\" The visiting coach, Oleksiy Mykhailychenko, admitted he had not seen the incident and yet added, rather bafflingly, that he \"assumed it was quite a dangerous and ruthless tackle\". Rooney was otherwise outstanding and ended up celebrating with Terry near the corner flag after the defender's winner, pretending to snip the centre-half's hair. \"I'd needed a cut during the week but we weren't allowed to leave the hotel,\" admitted Terry. \"I asked Wazza and he obliged by giving me a little trim. I'm pleased with it and I might go back next time. He was asking for a tenner, mind, but I still owe him. \"At 1\u20130 it was a little bit too easy for us and they weren't posing much threat at all. But, when they scored, you have to admire the desire and fight we showed. It could have been the case that, at 1\u20131, we'd have walked away half-happy at that result. But a push from the fans and the kick up the backside we gave ourselves at 1\u20131 helped us to go on and get the win. Overall we are pleased. \"You can see there's a huge difference in the way we're playing and a confidence in the team compared to the way we were playing in the Euro qualifiers. Everyone's playing with a smile on his face. The manager has made a few changes on and off the pitch, and things are going really well for us. The players are happy, playing their natural game, doing what's right and things have been going well. Win the next two games, against Kazakhstan and Andorra, and we will be in a very strong position.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
