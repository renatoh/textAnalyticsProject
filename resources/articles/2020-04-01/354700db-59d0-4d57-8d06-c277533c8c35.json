But the economy and jobs must return to normal,\u201d Bolsonaro said, as he introduced his new health minister, Nelson Teich, an oncologist who was CEO of a group of private clinics and is now a partner in a medical service consulting outfit. Mandetta\u2019s sacking has been anticipated for weeks, as Bolsonaro repeatedly downplayed coronavirus and urged the relaxation of social distancing measures while Mandetta defended such policies. But the move to force out Brazil\u2019s most senior health official came just weeks before the virus is expected to reach its peak in the country. Confirmed cases have soared to more than 30,425 and 1,924 Brazilians have died. When news of the sacking broke, shouts of \u201cBolsonaro murderer!\u201d were heard in central Rio de Janeiro and pan-bashing protests erupted in cities across the country. \u201cIt absurd to change the health minister in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d said one Rio de Janeiro intensive care doctor, speaking anonymously for fear of repercussions. \u201cIt was a terrible decision by the president, a president imprisoned in empirical ideas without any scientific or clinical basis, who is going against everything that is happening in the world.\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s public call for Brazil to get back to work and his efforts to undermine regional governments\u2019 shutdowns have appalled critics and sparked a political rebellion by the governors of nearly all of Brazil\u2019s 27 states. In contrast, during calm daily briefings Mandetta advised Brazilians to follow state governments\u2019 advice on isolation. \u201cDon\u2019t think that we are going to escape a sharp rise in cases of this illness,\u201d he said in his final briefing on Thursday. \u201cThe health system still isn\u2019t ready [to deal with] a rapid increase [in cases].\u201d Writing ahead of Bolsonaro\u2019s decision, the political commentator Leandro Colon said Mandetta\u2019s sacking might be good news \u201cfor those rooting for Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s quick downfall\u201d. Such a move would further isolate the rightwing populist and could provoke \u201ca political reaction of major proportions\u201d, Colon wrote in the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper. But Colon warned that Mandetta\u2019s removal would also be bad news for the health of Brazil\u2019s 211 million citizens. Recent modelling by researchers from Imperial College London suggested Brazil could have more than 1.1 million Covid-19 deaths if no action were taken to control the pandemic; 529,000 if only elderly people were forced to isolate; and 44,200 if drastic measures were implemented. Speaking after Mandetta\u2019s firing, Bolsonaro painted himself as a protector of the poor. \u201cWe cannot harm the neediest \u2013 they have no way of staying at home for very long without going out to seek their sustenance,\u201d he said. In his farewell press conference, Mandetta urged his former staff to mount an \u201cunyielding defense of life and science\u201d \u2013 a clear swipe at his former boss. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cScience is light \u2026 and it is through science that we will find a way out of this.\u201d His successor, Teich, said Brazil needed a full testing programme to better understand the new coronavirus and promised no \u201cabrupt decision\u201d on social distancing. But he also made it clear Brazil would slowly start reopening. \u201cWhat we are really doing here today is working for society to return to normal as quickly as possible,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
