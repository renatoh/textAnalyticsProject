Ms Rice received the support of 16 of the committee's 18 senators, with only the defeated presidential candidate, John Kerry, and fellow Democrat Barbara Boxer voting against her appointment. Pending approval by the Republican-led Senate, Ms Rice will become the first black woman to hold the job of secretary of state. Her appointment is likely to take place tomorrow, the day of President Bush's second term inauguration. The committee's vote came at the end of two days of confirmation hearings at which Ms Rice had faced strenuous Democrat assaults on the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq invasion. In a rare acknowledgement of a mistake by a member of the administration, she admitted today that some bad decisions had been made in Iraq and that the government had been unprepared for the task of stabilising the country. Her more candid responses followed criticism that her testimony yesterday belied the reality on the ground, where the continuing insurgency has delayed the training of Iraqi forces to take over from US troops. \"We have made a lot of decisions in this period of time. Some of them have been good, some of them have not been good, some of them have been bad decisions, I am sure,\" Ms Rice, who for the past four years has served as Mr Bush's national security adviser, said today. \"We didn't have the right skills, the right capacity, to deal with a reconstruction effort of this kind.\" Ms Rice refused to predict when the 150,000 US troops might return home, although she insisted that progress had been made in the training of Iraqis. But Democrat senators accused the administration of failing to learn from its mistakes, and called for still more candour. \"We've all got to be honest also with the world, otherwise we'll do terrible damage beyond what we've already done to our credibility,\" Senator Joe Biden, of Delaware, said. \"It's much harder for the world to rally to our side if we have to face a truly [imminent] threat in [North] Korea or Iran.\" Ms Boxer, the senator for California, who yesterday challenged the administration's case for war, urged Ms Rice to change policy where necessary. \"It seems to me there is a rigidness here, a lack of flexibility,\" she said. Ms Rice is, however, seen as being more in tune with Mr Bush and the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, than her predecessor, who was often portrayed as a lone dove in the last administration. An editorial in today's New York Times had also criticised Ms Rice for failing to admit mistakes, and speculated that her unwillingness to change strategy meant she would simply try to \"sell flawed American foreign policy\" abroad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
