Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The prime minister, Theresa May, told her MPs she wanted them to vote for an amendment that would push through her deal but replace the backstop with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d. The amendment was tabled by the party chair, Graham Brady, and some have identified it as a means for parliament to indicate to the European Union what a majority of MPs could be persuaded to accept, if not the deal May and EU leaders have thrashed out. The theory goes that political leaders on the continent might then relent in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It was indicated on Monday evening that the Tories would whip their MPs to vote for the amendment. It was unclear, however, whether that would be enough to force it through, with a significant number of May\u2019s own MPs indicating they were unlikely to follow those instructions. The hard Brexit-supporting ERG said it would not support the amendment and reiterated that opposition, even after it emerged the party would go so far as to whip MPs. The EU was not following the Brady script, with one of the most senior officials working on the Brexit deal saying the negotiations with the UK could not be reopened. Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, said there was a \u201cvery high risk of a crash out not by design, but by accident\u201d. Labour performed a late U-turn after coming in for serious criticism over its initial intention to instruct its MPs to abstain on the immigration bill. The party released a statement saying it opposed the bill but wanted to amend it at the next stage of its passage through Parliament, rather than actively oppose it now. Later, it said it would issue a single-line whip, indicating to MPs who do vote that they should vote against \u2013 while not actually requiring them to vote. The former head of MI5 Lady Manningham-Buller said the UK would be \u201cless safe\u201d if it left the EU without a deal. She said that she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the loss of access to things such as the Europol database and that there were a whole range of security issues which were \u201cdealt with better in a European context than not\u201d. For those wanting to read yet more, my colleagues Jessica Elgot and Heather Stewart have the full story on the Tories\u2019 manoeuvring today: It\u2019s perhaps worth noting that Labour appears to have issued a single-line whip, meaning it\u2019s indicating its general position on the issue but does not necessarily expect its MPs to turn up and vote \u2013 in this case, against the bill. The SNP\u2019s Stewart McDonald is unimpressed by the manoeuvre: Some Labour MPs, however, are indicating they plan to vote against \u2013 in some cases, regardless of what the party\u2019s official position was: It seems Labour MPs will now be asked to vote against the immigration bill tonight. The party had previously said it did not support the bill\u2019s aims, but would ask MPs to abstain (see 4.42pm). HuffPost UK\u2019s Paul Waugh has a little more detail on the possible timing of the vote: This afternoon, the health secrerary Matt Hancock told a Parliamentary committee that \u201cmedicines will be prioritised [over food] in the event of a no-deal Brexit\u201d. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has said: The fact that the health secretary is forced to make decisions over whether to prioritise medicine over food in the event of a Tory no-deal Brexit is simply astonishing. And it\u2019s all the more irresponsible that Theresa May stubbornly refuses to rule out no deal. Playing Russian roulette with the national interest and putting peoples\u2019 health at risk like this is shameful and scandalous. Earlier, it was reported that two MPs were planning to withdraw their amendments, making it more likely the Speaker, John Bercow, would call the Brady one. That\u2019s now been confirmed. John Baron, who tabled another of the amendments, has said: I urge fellow Conservatives to support [the Brady amendment]. This stands the best chance of uniting the party, getting the DUP on board, and sending a clear message to the EU that the backstop is the key problem \u2013 without a majority tomorrow, the EU could conclude the backstop is not important. The BBC\u2019s Iain Watson has some more on the government\u2019s thinking. As previously noted, the level of government support for the amendment may go some way to determining the actions of opposition parties. It may not be a government amendment but, with Theresa May choosing to whip the vote, will opposition MPs see a practical difference? Some more detail from Brandon Lewis, who has said: It (the Brady amendment) allows the prime minister to give a very clear message around what Parliament wants, where the party is. And actually that is quite a strong position to be in. I would hope the ERG, when they look at this and actually look through the detail of what this gives the PM tomorrow, in terms of a meaningful vote that will come back later, [see)] it is about giving a message to Europe about what can go through Parliament in terms of dealing with the backstop issue and why that matters. Graham Brady said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d the government would whip in support of his amendment as he left the meeting this evening. There are also now reports suggesting the new vote will be held within three weeks, leaving only sightly more than six weeks between it and Brexit itself on 29 March: It appears we now have confirmation that Tory MPs will be whipped to vote for the Brady amendment. There had been some confusion over exactly how far she would go in supporting it. The questions now are: Firstly, how many of her hard Brexit-supporting MPs can she take with her? The rightwing ERG has already said it will not back Brady and, according to the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford, has restated that position in light of the news it will be a whipped vote. Secondly, how will the other parties react now the amendment has government support? Here is more on the PM\u2019s meeting with Tory MPs. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham From CityAM\u2019s Owen Bennett That\u2019s all from me. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. More from the PM\u2019s meeting with Tory MPs. From the Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh From Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti From the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the BBC\u2019s Vicki Young The Conservative MPs Andrew Murrison and John Baron, who have also tabled anti backstop amendments in addition to the one known as the Graham Brady amendment (which is technically an Andrew Murrison amendment too, but never mind - see 9.22am), are going to withdraw their amendments, the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope reports. Withdrawing those amendments would increase the chances of John Bercow, the speaker, calling the Brady one. Given all the attention it is receiving, you would expect Bercow to call it anyway, but Number 10 see him as unhelpful and unpredictable, and are clearly taking no chances. This, from my colleague Dan Sabbagh, sums up the problem rather well. We\u2019re getting confusing messages from the PM\u2019s meeting with Conservative MPs. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. But this is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. And this is from my colleague Dan Sabbagh. Theresa May is urging Conservative MPs to back the Graham Brady amendment (see 9.22am), ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reports. Given that the European Research Group, the most powerful caucus in the parliamentary Conservative party, has come out against Brady (see 5.03pm), this seems to be what civil servants would call a \u201ccourageous\u201d move by May. She has just backed an amendment that seems likely to fail - not least because if May is backing Brady, Labour Brexiters will think twice about voting for what will be seen as a de facto government amendment. Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, could not get into the meeting for Conservative MPs with Theresa May, Sky\u2019s Kate McCann reports. Theresa May has just arrived for her meeting with Conservative MPs in one of the committee rooms at parliament, ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt reports. Labour\u2019s backing for Yvette Cooper\u2019s anti no-deal Brexit amendment has been thrown into doubt, after a shadow cabinet ally of Jeremy Corbyn warned that supporting it would smack of \u201cignoring the views of millions of ordinary folk\u201d, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Labour had been widely expected to whip its MPs to support the amendment, tabled by Cooper and former Conservative minister Nick Boles, which paves the way for a backbench bill mandating the government to seek a nine-month extension to article 50. But Jon Trickett, the shadow cabinet office minister, told the Guardian voters in his constituency would regard support for the measure on Tuesday as a failure to respect the result of the 2016 referendum. Heather\u2019s full story is here. And this is from my colleague Jessica Elgot, who has been outside the meeting where the European Research Group, which represents the more hardline Tory Brexiters, have been discussing tomorrow\u2019s votes. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford, on the prospects of the Yvette Cooper amendment passing tomorrow. Here is more on what Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, was saying at the European Policy Centre conference in Brussels this afternoon. These are from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston says most Tory Brexiters in European Research Group will not vote for the Graham Brady amendment tomorrow. Labour has issued a statement explaining its decision to abstain at the second reading of the immigration bill tonight. (See 3.48pm and 3.54pm.) Labour does not support the intentions contained in this bill and will therefore be seeking to amend this Bill substantially at committee stage. Our immigration system must be ready post-Brexit, and for that reason we need an immigration bill. But Labour totally opposes the Tories\u2019 disgraceful hostile environment policy, their terrible treatment of EU and UK citizens, their persistent anti-migrant campaign and their shameful labelling of workers earning less than \u00a330,000 as low-skilled. Labour has set out our proposed immigration system that supports the needs of our economy and treats people fairly. We will introduce a work visa for all those we need to fill skills and labour shortages across a range of professions we need to come here \u2013 based on the needs of our economy, not a false distinction between high and low skilled workers based on their salary. Downing Street is now saying the government might table its own amendment ahead of tomorrow\u2019s debate, the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner reports. Facebook will tackle political misinformation in the run-up to the EU elections this May with a new \u201cwar room\u201d based in Dublin, the company\u2019s incoming communications chief, Nick Clegg, has announced. My colleague Alex Hearn has the full story here. And, while we\u2019re on the subject of the immigration bill (see 3.48pm), the Lib Dems have sent out an unusually pithy press release about the subject. MPs will debate the second reading of the immigration bill this afternoon (or the immigration and social security coordination [EU withdrawal] bill, to give it its full title). This is the legislation that will bring EU nationals under UK immigration law after Brexit. Labour will abstain when it comes to the vote. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, has criticised the decision. LabourRichard is Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader. Anna Soubry, the Tory pro-European, says she is voting against. And the Labour MP Chris Leslie (a frequent critic of the Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s) is voting against it too. Labour has not responded to a question about why it is abstaining. But the party has accepted the case for ending freedom of movement after Brexit, while it has been highly critical of the government\u2019s specific plans for migration controls on EU nationals after Brexit, and so perhaps its position is no great surprise. Lady Manningham-Buller, the former head of MI5, told the World at One that the UK would be \u201cless safe\u201d if it left the EU without a deal. She said that she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the loss of access to things like the Europol database and that there were a whole range of security issues which were \u201cdealt with better in a European context than not\u201d. She told the programme: If we leave without a deal we are going to be less safe ... I am pretty queasy that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is so in favour of Brexit \u2013 I think that should give us all pause. She also said that she was \u201cmore than sympathetic\u201d to the Yvette Cooper bill designed to stop the government taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. When it was put to her that it was unconstitutional (because Cooper has a plan to allow her bill to be debated without government approval), Manningham-Buller did not accept that. She went on: It seems to me there\u2019s an irony here. The Brexiters - and I\u2019m not one of them - argue that it\u2019s about taking back parliamentary sovereignty. If it\u2019s about about taking back parliamentary sovereignty, parliament is sovereign. And I think no deal, and the uncertainties of no deal ... [are] to be avoided at all costs. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham, quoting an unnamed ERG member explaining why they are sceptical about the Graham Brady amendment. This argument matches the one used by Boris Johnson in his Telegraph column this morning. See 9.59am. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP and chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, has played down reports that the ERG is split over whether or not to back the Graham Brady amendment. This is from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, has issued a statement urging the government to be \u201ctough\u201d in the Brexit talks and exploit what he claims is the \u201creal chaos\u201d in Brussels and Dublin. What he is saying will surprise observers who might assume that, if you are looking for a place mired in Brexit chaos, another capital might make a better candidate ... Theresa May is meeting Conservative MP this evening to discuss Brexit, the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson reports. Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, has been speaking at an event in Brussels. The Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge has posted some quotes from her opening remarks, and they are unusually blunt. Weyand says it is \u201ca big challenge\u201d to see how the UK will secure a majority for any Brexit deal. She seems to rule out the EU reopening the negotiation with the UK, saying it\u2019s over. She accuses the UK of \u201csnatching defeat from the jaws of victory\u201d, saying the backstop was a much better for the UK than people assume. She insists that the EU has already firmly rejected calls for the backstop to be time-limited. She implies some British MPs are ignorant of what is in the withdrawal agreement. She says there is a \u201cvery high risk\u201d of a no-deal Brexit. Here is the letter from supermarket bosses to MPs warning about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. For our Future\u2019s Sake (FFS), the student-led anti-Brexit campaign, has released some polling from Opinium suggesting young people are losing faith in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of Brexit. \u201cIn just 6 months, 18-34-year-old\u2019s approval of how Corbyn is responding to Brexit has plummeted 27 percentage points, from +13% in July to -14% this week,\u201d it says. Kira Lewis, an FFS activist, said: Unfortunately, over the last 6 months, there\u2019s been a massive drop in young people\u2019s approval of how Jeremy Corbyn in handling Brexit. The reason for this is painfully clear - the overwhelming majority of Corbyn supporters, like myself, want Labour to back a People\u2019s Vote on the Brexit deal, but if Labour and him enable Brexit, they are at risk of losing young supporters. It is quite possible that all the Brexit amendments called tomorrow will be voted down, the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman argues. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg thinks this is quite likely too. Here are some more clues as to what Tory Brexiters think about the Graham Brady amendment. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes Supermarkets could run out of food and be forced to raise prices under a no-deal Brexit, the British Retail Consortium has told MPs in a letter. The BBC has further details. The Graham Brady amendment seems to be losing Brexiter supporter. A prominent Tory Brexiter called me earlier (about something else) and complained that the Brady amendment was \u201ctoo vague\u201d. Other colleagues are picking up the same reservations. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. And this is from the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Elgot. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street said explicitly that the Brexit withdrawal deal would have to change. (See 12.31pm.) The prime minister\u2019s spokesman suggested that, despite EU claims that the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated (repeated this morning - see 12.31pm), the EU would have to compromise. Asked about EU objections to a renegotiation, he said: What we have consistently heard from European leaders is that they want the United Kingdom to leave with a deal. There\u2019s a recognition that the United Kingdom leaving with a deal is in their best interests, as well as those of the UK. The deal which has been agreed was defeated by parliament. Therefore, if we are going to leave with a deal, clearly we are going to need to make some changes in order to win parliamentary support. The spokesman said that May wanted to hold another vote in the Commons to agree a revised Brexit deal \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. This is what Number 10 refer to as \u201cthe second meaningful vote\u201d. But the spokesman would not give any further guidance as to when this might be. He said the talks with MPs intended to find out what might be acceptable to parliament were still going on - today May has meetings with Tory MPs and MEPs - but he would not say when this process was due to end. The spokesman implied that MPs worried about a no-deal Brexit did not have to vote tomorrow night to try to stop this. Referring to the \u201csecond meaningful vote\u201d, he said the motion would be amendable - meaning that MPs might have another chance to vote on a no-deal amendment at a later stage. The spokesman refused to commit the government to complying with all the amendments that might be passed tomorrow. Asked if the government would respect the wishes of parliament whatever was decided tomorrow, the spokesman would not answer directly, saying at this stage it was not clear what amendments would be put to a vote, but he went on to say that \u201cas a statement of fact\u201d some of the amendments were not legally binding. In fact, most of them are not legally binding. The only ones with practical force (as opposed to political force) are those that would change the rules of the Commons, and one of those, the Yvette Cooper one, is intended to make time for a bill that would impose a specific legal requirement on the prime minister (to seek an extension of article 50 if there is no Brexit deal by 26 February). May will close the Brexit debate tomorrow night, Number 10 said. That means she will speak in the final half hour before the vote at 7pm. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will open the debate. The spokesman urged John Bercow, the speaker, to select a wide variety of amendments tomorrow. Amendments are only put to a vote if they are selected. The spokesman said the choice of amendments was entirely a matter for Bercow. But he added: I\u2019m sure he will want to make sure that a wide range of views from across the House are considered. The spokesman would not say whether government MPs will be asked to back the Graham Brady amendment, saying it was too soon to comment because the speaker has not decided yet which amendments he will call. That decision will only be taken at a speaker\u2019s meeting tomorrow morning. The spokesman dismissed a Guardian story saying that Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, told May in a phone call that she would have to keep the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU if she wants to renegotiate the backstop. The spokesman said the story \u201csimply does not reflect the reality\u201d of the call. The spokesman distanced May from the anti-German language that the Tory MP Mark Francois used last week to describe Tom Enders, the German Airbus boss who issued a warning about a no-deal Brexit. Asked about what Francois said, the spokesman said: They are not things that I would expect [May] to say. But the spokesman refused an invitation to say whether May was worried about the impact comments like this might have on Germans considering doing business with the UK. The European commission hold a daily press briefing which takes place at the same time as Downing Street\u2019s. And, just as Number 10 was saying that the withdrawal deal would have to change (although not necessarily the text of the withdrawal agreement - see 11.57am), Brussels said it was the withdrawal agreement would not be reopened. Margaritis Schinas, the commission\u2019s spokesman, told journalists: We have a unanimous EU27 position on the withdrawal agreement which reflects the common EU position. This withdrawal agreement has been agreed with the UK government, it is endorsed by leaders and is not open for renegotiation. Asked if that position would change if MPs vote to demand changes to the Irish backstop, Schinas said: The only thing I have to say is that we shall wait for the result of the vote of the Commons tomorrow. Then we will wait for the government to tell us what are the next steps. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work. Brussels\u2019 senior officials will consider the latest \u201cBrexit preparedness and contingency\u201d measures at this week\u2019s college of commissioners meeting on Wednesday. I\u2019m just back from the lobby briefing, and Number 10 is now explicitly saying that the EU will have to agree to changes to the Brexit deal. This is not much more than a statement of the obvious, and it was implicit in what Theresa May said in her Commons statement last week following the defeat of her deal, but on that occasion May was careful to avoid anything that sounded like an ultimatum to the EU. Now Number 10 is saying directly that the deal will have to be changed. Number 10 has said the withdrawal deal will have to change. In a message that makes an attempt to renegotiate the deal with the EU, at least to some extent, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists: We reached an agreement with the European Union in relation to the withdrawal agreement and the future partnership. That was put to a vote of MPs, and MPs rejected that deal, including the withdrawal agreement, by 230 votes. The prime minister is absolutely committed to leaving the EU with a deal, but clearly if we are to obtain parliamentary support for that deal, some changes will have to be made. But the spokesman would not be drawn on whether \u201csome changes\u201d meant the text of the withdrawal agreement itself would have to change (as Boris Johnson is demanding - see 9.59am), or whether some form of addendum (like Graham Brady\u2019s codicil - see 9.59am) might do the trick. I will post more from the briefing shortly. My colleague Matthew d\u2019Ancona has a good column today explaining why, as someone with centre-right politics, he can now no longer identify with the Conservative party. It is \u201cmorphing into something I find alien and repellent\u201d, he says. In an article for Prospect, the Conservative pro-European Dominic Grieve makes a similarish argument, in slightly more diplomatic terms. Here\u2019s an excerpt. So it is impossible to look at what we have done over Brexit without astonishment. In the three years since David Cameron started the 2016 referendum process, we have taken our country on a path of revolutionary upheaval ... It is small wonder that all this has produced both chaos and paralysis in government and parliament ... Our ability as a party to get through this crisis will determine our future fortunes. As a Conservative MP it is my duty to listen to colleagues and to try and find a way through. But we will not find one unless we remember that, historically, the secret of our success as a party has been our ability to provide hope, confidence and leadership for a much wider group of electoral supporters than our membership. Streams of emails may only be the roughest of guides, but I am struck by the numbers who write to me who once gave us their support and now do not. Unless we reassure them of our ability to deliver the quiet stable government they desire, our relevance to promoting the wellbeing of our country must be in question. I\u2019m just off to the lobby briefing. I will post again after 11.30am. It is also worth noting that, in his Telegraph column today (paywall), Boris Johnson strikes a rather different tone on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal from the one he adopted when he resigned last summer. Today he implies that, provided May is able to get rid of the backstop, he will enthusiastically back her plan. He says: If we mean it, if we really try, I have no doubt that the EU will give us the freedom clause we need. So now is the time to stiffen the sinews and summon up the blood and get on that trusty BAE 146 and go back to Brussels and get it. And if the PM secures that change \u2013 a proper UK-sized perforation in the fabric of the backstop itself - I have no doubt that she will have the whole country full-throatedly behind her. But, when he resigned from cabinet last summer, in his resignation letter Johnson did not even mention the backstop. Instead, he condemned the whole thrust of May\u2019s plan for a future UK-EU trade deal. He said: The British government has spent decades arguing against this or that EU directive, on the grounds that it was too burdensome or ill-thought out. We are now in the ludicrous position of asserting that we must accept huge amounts of precisely such EU law, without changing an iota, because it is essential for our economic health - and when we no longer have any ability to in\ufb02uence these laws as they are made. In that respect we are truly headed for the status of colony - and many will struggle to see the economic or political advantages of that particular arrangement. To be fair, at that point there was no withdrawal agreement; Johnson was attacking the Chequers plan, which in some respects has been superseded by the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. But, after the withdrawal agreement, Johnson continued to condemn it severely, and not just for its backstop plan. This is what he said in a Telegraph column (paywall) shortly before the vote on the plan earlier this month. This deal would still make it impossible to do big free-trade deals \u2013 as the US ambassador has correctly pointed out. It would prevent us from engaging in the kind of regulatory divergence \u2013 control of our own laws \u2013 that people voted for. And since not a dot or a comma of this deal has changed in the past month, it still means that we are set to hand over \u00a339bn for nothing, and with no guarantees about our future relationship. This deal is still the worst of both worlds, by which we somehow leave the EU but end up being run by the EU. It is still a complete stinker, and so no \u2013 I can\u2019t tell exactly what will happen on Tuesday. But I cannot believe that it has much of a chance of getting past the House of Commons. It is worth pointing out that Sir Graham Brady and Boris Johnson, although both Brexiters and both demanding a replacement to the backstop, have set slightly different red lines. On the BBC\u2019s Westminster Hour last night Brady said that the demand set out in his amendment (see 9.22am) would not necessarily require the withdrawal agreement to be rewritten. He explained: You wouldn\u2019t have to open up the withdrawal agreement. You could do it through a legally binding codicil to the withdrawal agreement ... I think the crucial thing is a legally binding change that makes it clear that the United Kingdom can never be trapped in the backstop in perpetuity. But Johnson implies that a codicil, or some other form of legally-binding addendum to the withdrawal agreement, would not be enough. He says the withdrawal agreement would have to be re-opened, to allow the insertion of what he calls his \u201cfreedom clause\u201d. (See 9.22am.) In his Telegraph column (paywall) he says: If she can put in that freedom clause or clauses \u2013 and be in no doubt, this means reopening the text of the Treaty itself \u2013 then we have defused the booby-trap. We have opened a hole at the bottom of the lobster pot. We will have a way out, and we will be able to negotiate the next phase \u2013 the future partnership \u2013 without having our hands fettered by the EU, and do the Canada-style free trade deal that will maximise the long term opportunities of Brexit. For the record, this is what Theresa May said in her statement to the Commons last Monday about her plans to get further assurances on the backstop. With regard to the backstop, despite the changes we have previously agreed, there remain two core issues: the fear that we could be trapped in it permanently; and concerns over its potential impact on our Union if Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK. So I will be talking further this week to colleagues - including in the DUP \u2013 to consider how we might meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland in a way that can command the greatest possible support in the House. And I will then take the conclusions of those discussion back to the EU. Tomorrow there will be a debate in the Commons that may start to give the UK a Brexit policy - something that has been conspicuously absent since Theresa May\u2019s plan was rejected by MPs earlier this month in the most crushing government defeat in UK politics in the democratic era. There is a guide to what is coming up here, and there is particularly interest in what is being referred to as the Graham Brady amendment, which says: At end, add \u201cand requires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border; supports leaving the European Union with a deal and would therefore support the withdrawal agreement subject to this change.\u201d. (Technically it should be known as the Andrew Murrison amendment, because Murrison is the MP who tabled it, but he is primarily associated with another one. For the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll keep calling it Brady\u2019s.) Downing Street has not said yet how it will instruct government MPs to vote on this amendment. If Theresa May were to formally endorse it, that would amount to the government saying it now wants to replace the backstop that it signed up to only at the end of last year. But May has admitted that there will have to be changes to the backstop for the deal to pass parliament, and if the Brady amendment were pass with a majority, she would be able to go back to Brussels and explain that this was the change necessary to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament. This morning Brady, who as chair of the Conservative 1922 committee serves as the shop steward for Tory backbenchers, said he thought the government would support his amendment. Asked if it has government backing, Brady, who voted leave in the referendum, told the Today programme: I hope so ... I don\u2019t know so. The amendment was born out of a number of conversations I had with colleagues including members of the government, including the prime minister. I had also spoken to people in the DUP too and I\u2019m hoping that the way in which the amendment is crafted can attract that very broad support and if we can win the vote on my amendment then I think it gives the prime minister enormous firepower. And this morning Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, has used his Telegraph column (paywall) to say that May is also now committed to getting rid of the backstop. He said: I have heard it from the lips of very senior sources in government \u2013 speaking with the authority, it is claimed, of the prime minister herself \u2013 that this country is about to seek proper binding legal change to the current lamentable withdrawal agreement. The PM wants to get rid of the backstop; that is, she wants to change the text so as to insert either a sunset clause or a mechanism for the UK to escape without reference to the EU. She is going to fight for a freedom clause \u2013 right there in article 185 of the protocol or thereabouts \u2013 that would finally give us the keys to our own future. If she can change the backstop, then yes, we would be able to do free trade deals, and yes, we would be able to vary our regulation, and yes, the whole of the UK would be able to leave the EU \u2013 proud and intact \u2013 without leaving Northern Ireland a perpetual hostage. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 4pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives evidence to the Commons health committee. 4pm: Sir Mark Sedwill, the national security adviser and cabinet secretary, gives evidence to the joint national security committee. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I finish, at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
