Our new life\u2019s an adventure\u2019", "bodyText": "Last June, Tim Hunt and Mary Collins sat on the sofa in the front room of their Hertfordshire cottage and wept openly, clinging to each other for comfort. Hunt\u2019s jokes about the alleged lachrymose tendencies of female researchers at an international conference that week had gone viral and the couple were bombarded with abuse on social media. When they were interviewed by the Observer, both looked tired and unhappy. \u201cWe were in shock,\u201d Collins recalls. That was then. During their interview with the Observer last week, both scientists were laughing and poking fun at each other. They even posed for photographs clutching guides to Japanese gardens and cuisine \u2013 a reference to the new life they are starting. Mary Collins, a senior scientist at University College London (UCL), has been appointed director of research for a prestigious new university, the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology. \u201cSetting up the institute is a big commitment by the Japanese cabinet and it will be my job to build up the faculty and make sure this university works,\u201d she says. The aim is to establish a world-leading, interdisciplinary research centre on the island. \u201cThe institute already has top people in fields that range from theoretical physics to marine biology. We will be doing stuff there that you cannot do anywhere else.\u201d Okinawa is a subtropical island south of mainland Japan and its geography gives it key advantages. \u201cYou can study deep-sea vents which are close to the island and work on coral, that sort of thing. We are also extremely well funded,\u201d she says. (The institute\u2019s budget last year was around \u00a3110m.) In a few days, Collins and Hunt \u2013 who were married 20 years ago and have two daughters \u2013 will head off to Okinawa for a brief tour of the institute and its facilities before returning to the island in the summer with their dog, Molly \u2013 a maltese shih tzu \u2013 to spend the next five years there. \u201cI love Japan,\u201d says Hunt. \u201cI will be very happy. I will do the shopping and the cooking.\u201d The couple\u2019s move is the latest, but almost certainly not the last, twist in one of the most extraordinary academic tales of recent years. Hunt, who won the 2001 Nobel prize in physiology for his work on cell division, was attending a conference in Seoul in June when he was asked to speak at a meeting about women in science. \u201cLet me tell you about my trouble with girls,\u201d he told delegates. \u201cThree things happen when they are in the lab. You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them, they cry.\u201d His words were tweeted around the world, though no mention was made of the fact that he had followed his remarks with the phrase \u201cnow seriously\u201d before praising the achievements of women scientists in Korea. Hunt was deluged with electronic hate mail and was hounded from several academic posts. He was flying back from Seoul to Britain after making his remarks when Collins was called at home by UCL where she is a professor, and a former dean, while Hunt was an honorary researcher. Collins was told by a senior academic that she had to call her husband the moment he landed to tell him he had to resign immediately or be sacked. Hunt chose the former, though he insists that UCL never asked him for his account of the affair. Worse was to follow. The European Research Council (ERC) \u2013 Hunt served on its science committee \u2013 decided to force him to stand down in view of his resignation from UCL. Under pressure, he quit a series of other posts. In vain, Hunt issued several apologies for his \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments. \u201cMy remarks were inexcusable, I admit it,\u201d he says. Today, Hunt has only two posts left: one at the Crick Institute which opens soon in London, the other at the Weizmann Institute in Israel. \u201cIt took me several weeks to realise how badly misrepresented I had been. I was turned into a straw man that one lot loves to love and the other lot loves to hate and then they just take up sides and hurled utterly vile abuse at everyone. It was extraordinary.\u201d A week after the storm broke, Hunt and Collins agreed to an interview with the Observer in which they said they had been hung out to dry by UCL and other organisations. A backlash took place and figures such as Richard Dawkins, Brian Cox, and Boris Johnson offered sympathy while a number of prominent female scientists \u2013 including biologist Professor Ottoline Leyser, of Cambridge University; Nancy Rothwell, vice-chancellor of Manchester University and Dame Athene Donald, professor of experimental physics at Cambridge \u2013 as well as many young women who had worked in Hunt\u2019s laboratories came forward to express support and exonerate him of the charge of sexism (but not of making stupid jokes). But Hunt and Collins are still pained by the experience. \u201cIt is the world of Twitter, blogging and leaving comments on stories online that did so much damage. Using them is such an utterly worthless waste of time,\u201d says Collins. The couple\u2019s room is crammed with books, mostly on science, cooking and gardening. There is a signed Warhol picture and a pair of medieval prints that once belonged to Hunt\u2019s father, Richard, a historian. Nevertheless, it is clear they will both be glad to make a new start after their tribulations. Collins says she applied for the Okinawa post before the controversy erupted. \u201cI was head-hunted before June by the institute and made a strong application in return because I thought this looks a great job. We are glad we are going but we are not doing so because we have been chased out of the country. This sort of job was always part of my life plan,\u201d she says. The loss of a leading UK female scientist is perhaps one of the more ironic outcomes of the Hunt affair, as Professor Donald points out. \u201cThe UK needs to have more visible senior female role models and champions in science to inspire future generations of talented female scientists. Mary Collins\u2019s departure to Japan is therefore a huge loss to her community. However, Japan probably has even more need of such visible women scientists than this country and the UK\u2019s loss is their gain.\u201d For his part, Hunt \u2013 who will be 73 in February \u2013 is enthusiastic about the move. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an adventure,\u201d he says. \u201cI will learn Japanese and do all sorts of things. It\u2019s a great country.\u201d Collins says: \u201cJapanese universities suffer a little bit because the language is a barrier. English is the language of science \u2013 journals are in English and so in Britain we do quite well. The Okinawa institute will be international and English will be the language used there. It is a new approach for them. \u201cThere are strong academic links between the UK and Japan and we are alike in many ways. We are both island nations, are understated in our demeanour, have good senses of humour \u2013 and both like seafood \u2026 \u201d Hunt agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s known as the Hawaii of Japan, a tropical paradise. What is there to lose?\u201d THE HUNT CONTROVERSY 9 June At a lunch for female journalists and scientists during the 2015 World Conference of Science Journalists in Seoul, Hunt was asked to make a speech, in which he described \u201cmy trouble with girls\u201d. 10 June After some audience members shared Hunt\u2019s comments on social media, Hunt\u2019s comments were reported in the press. In an interview with the Today programme, Hunt apologised for causing any offence. Hunt resigned from his position as an honorary professor at UCL. 14 June In an exclusive interview with the Observer, Hunt said he had \u201cbeen hung out to dry\u201d and revealed that he resigned from UCL after being told that if he did not he would be sacked. 22 June Former students and colleagues of Hunt wrote to the Times criticising UCL. 30 June Jonathan Dimbleby resigned his honorary fellowship at UCL in protest at its \u201cdisgraceful\u201d treatment of Hunt. 18 July A recording emerged of Hunt\u2019s remarks, in which it was clear he intended them in jest and that some of the audience had laughed. 10 October The scientist Sir Colin Blakemore resigned as honorary president of the Association of British Science Writers because it supported Connie St Louis , one of the journalists present at Hunt\u2019s speech who was accused of presenting an exaggerated account."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
