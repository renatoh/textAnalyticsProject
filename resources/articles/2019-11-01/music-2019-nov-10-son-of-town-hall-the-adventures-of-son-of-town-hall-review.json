The pair are accomplished musicians (from London and Santa Fe respectively) but believe a little theatre doesn\u2019t go amiss, dressing like extras from Gangs of New York and casting themselves as vagrants borne on the tides of late 19th-century America. Their offbeat name is borrowed from a famously unsinkable raft made from flotsam. The conceit \u2013 a shaggy dog tale of the steampunk era \u2013 wouldn\u2019t work if the music didn\u2019t, but Parker and Berkeley prove equal to the task. Their songs arrive on a wave of intricate finger-picked guitars, with flourishes of fiddle and brass, and seamless vocal harmonies that carry a tang of Simon and Garfunkel. Their stories are of sea voyages, betrayal and desolation, told with a narrator\u2019s cadence: \u201cYou wore a red dress, it must have been July.\u201d California imagines them as gold rush pioneers, Cobbler\u2019s Hill is a forlorn love call and Morning Fields, serenaded by Nickel Creek\u2019s fiddler, revels in nature\u2019s beauty. Lightly worn (see video for The Line Between), but a more coherent concept album you\u2019ll be pushed to find."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
