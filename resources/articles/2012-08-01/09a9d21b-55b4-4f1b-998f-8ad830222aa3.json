Prior to the competition Taylor had aimed to break Jonathan Edwards's 1995 world record of 18m 29cm, but took the Olympic title with a jump of 17.81, the longest of the year. The contest was originally billed as a showdown between the 22-year old American and Phillips Idowu until the injured Briton failed to qualify for the final. Instead it became a battle between Taylor and Claye, who won long jump bronze on Saturday night. Claye took silver and the bronze went to Fabrizio Donato of Italy. There was more success for the USA in the decathlon where Ashton Eaton won gold. The 28-year old, who on Wednesday ran the fastest 100m in the event's history at 10.35sec, scored 8,869 points to see off his compatriot Trey Hardee while Leonel Su\u00e1rez took bronze. The Czech Republic's Barbora Spotakova won javelin gold, throwing 69.55m to beat the Germans Christina Obergfoll and Linda Stahl into silver and bronze. In the women's 800m semi-finals South Africa's Caster Semenya qualified easily for Saturday's final in her first Olympics in a swift 1m 57.67 sec, a season's best. Team GB's Lynsey Sharp failed to qualify after falling into last place on the first lap and clawing back only to seventh after the bell. Her selection had been controversial because she achieved a slower Olympic qualifying time than other British runners who were left out. In the women's 4x100m relay USA qualified first in their heat in 41.65sec, the second fastest time in Olympic history and the fastest seen on British soil, despite resting their double sprint medallist Carmelita Jeter. She is expected to appear in the later rounds. Jamaica, anchored by Kerron Stewart, also qualified despite resting their 100m gold and bronze medallists Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Veronica Campbell-Brown. They came in second behind Ukraine who crossed the line in 42.36 sec. Earlier, in a 4x400m relay heat, South Africa first crashed out of the race after a collison with a Kenyan with Oscar Pistorius waiting for a baton that never arrived. Almost two hours later an IAAF jury of appeal ruled to give Pistorius's team lane 9 which otherwise would have been vacant in Friday's final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
