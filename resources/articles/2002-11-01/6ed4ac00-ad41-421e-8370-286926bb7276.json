After watching a video of Saturday's derby, the referee Mike Riley accepted that Davies should not have been booked for an early challenge on Ashley Cole and agreed to wipe out that first caution. However Davies will miss Tottenham's game at Birmingham on November 30 because his second yellow card, earned for a foul on Patrick Vieira, has brought his tally of cautions for the campaign to five. There could be further disciplinary fallout from the game at Highbury because of allegations that Tottenham's Ledley King stamped on Freddie Ljungberg. The Football Association will wait to see if the incident is included in Riley's report before deciding whether to call for video evidence. Middlesbrough's George Boateng could also be in trouble after television pictures appeared to show him catching Chelsea's Gianfrano Zola with an arm on Saturday. The Birmingham City fan who invaded the pitch during his team's derby victory over Aston Villa in September has been jailed for four months. Michael Harper ran on to the field after every goal during the 3-0 win and also slapped the Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman. He has also been banned by Birmingham magistrates from attending any designated matches for the next six years. \u00b7 The Gary Lineker-led consortium that aims to rescue Leicester City from administration expects to take its next step towards buying the club by the end of the week. The consortium believe it is in a position to make an offer after meeting 20 potential investors at the Walkers Stadium yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
