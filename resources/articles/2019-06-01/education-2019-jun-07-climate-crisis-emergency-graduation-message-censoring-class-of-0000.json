A youth-led movement called Class of 0000 is encouraging students to read out a prepared text at their graduation ceremonies that warns of \u201ccatastrophic climate change\u201d and tells elected leaders to \u201chave plan to get to zero emissions, or get zero of our votes\u201d. More than 350 students set to speak at ceremonies as valedictorians, or in other roles, have pledged to read the message, but many have complained that educational authorities have barred them from doing so as the global climate emergency is deemed too political to mention. In the US education system, a valedictorian is typically a student with the highest academic performance in the class. This student delivers a farewell speech for the class at its graduation. Emily Shal, an 18-year-old senior class president, felt that her school considered that the climate message was \u201ctoo controversial\u201d for her graduation speech. Shal had read the speech at a talent show before the graduation ceremony and said she still received backlash from school authorities. \u201cThe administration were very mad, they were pissed,\u201d said Shal, who attends Whittier Tech high school in Haverhill, Massachusetts. \u201cEveryone was telling me I was in trouble. They now consider me rogue and rebellious. I was really worried about repercussions.\u201d Worried that she would be dragged off stage if she made the climate speech, Shal decided to apologize and comply with the demand not to mention climate change at the ceremony last week. She said a large majority of her classmates consider climate a \u201chuge topic\u201d that needs to be addressed. \u201cThe school thinks it is a political issue that shouldn\u2019t be brought up,\u201d she said. \u201cMy freedom of speech was definitely taken away. We are tearing down our home, the Earth, and it should be our No 1 concern in the world. But it\u2019s not.\u201d Whittier Tech said: \u201cWe are saddened that our former student felt that she would not have Whittier\u2019s support in speaking about a subject she is clearly passionate about. She does and she would have. \u201cWhittier Tech does not benefit from discouraging students from freely expressing their opinions on relevant, worldly topics. We do not participate in such discouragement.\u201d Jessica Lopez, another 18-year-old senior, was told by the principal of Health Sciences high and middle college in San Diego that she shouldn\u2019t mention climate change as it\u2019s political and instead \u201cshould be celebrating our achievements\u201d in a more traditional graduation speech. Lopez said she was surprised as her school is \u201cfriendly and innovative\u201d and previously allowed students to take part in a walkout to protest school shootings. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to me that we could voice our opinions then, but are silenced when we want to talk about climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cI was very upset and felt like I didn\u2019t want to go up there and be a hypocrite. It\u2019s created a lot of tension between the class and the administration.\u201d In lieu of her planned speech, Lopez and most of her class plan to don badges that say \u201cNo Planet B\u201d for the ceremony. \u201cA lot of adults blame our generation for being sensitive but we have to deal with the problems they have caused,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating. We are vocal about climate change because no one else is going to do anything about it. On this issue, it feels like the adults are the children.\u201d In other incidents, two students at Albany high school in California said their attempts to get climate change mentioned in graduation speeches were rebuffed. One, Tamara Valenzuela, used social media to attack the decision. A separate student, Saisantosh Tiruchinapalli from Arizona, was told he could mention the importance of voting but not climate change. The climate crisis has become a deeply polarized issue in the US, to the point that recent polling shows it divides voters even more than issues such as abortion and gun control. A growing youth climate moment has sought to break the political deadlock in the wake of a series of dire warnings from scientists over the flooding, wildfires, drought and societal unrest that global heating is spurring. Many of the US students planning to speak out say they were inspired by Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenager who inspired an international wave of school strikes over the climate crisis. Meanwhile, the Sunrise Movement, one of the US groups that helped organize the Class of 0000 initiative, has been driven by youth activists and has been at the forefront of championing the Green New Deal, a plan to rapidly decarbonize the US economy. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2019 to clarify that Albany high school students were not told to drop climate change from graduation speeches, though no speeches containing the Class of 0000 message were selected. It was further amended on 20 June 2019 to clarify comments from Emily Shal and to add a response from the school, Whittier Tech."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
