Mr M proudly told shareholders a few days ago that his News Corp was now the most valuable media company on the planet. True enough, at least in one Wall Street way. Almost as he spoke, his big baby's market capitalisation hit $67.79bn and pushed Time Warner into second place. Here was a fourth consecutive year of record results on revenues of $28.7bn. An internet business with 160 million customers, a TV business with 270 channels in 75 countries; here was the biggest-selling stable of newspapers in the English-speaking world. His 'traditional peers' had been left behind. 'We're starting to be rewarded for our efforts,' said Rupert, modestly. Now, you can debate the precise terms of such triumph, to be sure. (Is Google a 'media company'? If it is, then News Corp trails). Nevertheless, in terms of change, consistent performance and success, the company Murdoch built from the ground up has become an acknowledged global giant. Not just big in New York, Sydney and London: big almost everywhere. And therefore big questions accumulate. Some of them were asked, almost ritually, at and around that New York AGM. Does a ring-fenced 30 per cent family shareholding structure give the boss and his heirs too much clout? Answer: Possibly, but he'll bite your leg off if you try to kick it away. Where does leadership in the next generation come from, then? Answer: There's only son James, a very bright cookie - though not yet a master chef. Does Murdoch pere have too much power? Answer: watch this MySpace. But perhaps the greatest question, the one barely posed so far, also flows from perceived success. Can you be the world's biggest one-man band? We're used, in the old mode, to dealing with Rupert as a kind of Citizen Oz-Kane. We see him as dealer, propagandist, supreme fixer. But he's more than that now. His company is self-proclaimed Number One. And, increasingly, it will have to begin adjusting to that reputation. Things that once worked - say, appeasing Beijing's leaders by dumping the BBC from China satellite transmission - will look merely scruffy. Number Ones don't truckle so obviously. Things that might have got by before he bought the WSJ - say, moving the Dow by way of new, happy-clappy Fox Business Network reports - will have to be far more circumspectly examined. And things that were just about OK in a teeth-gritting way a year or 10 back - tax things involving the Cayman and other islands, for instance - may now look teeth-clenchingly tacky. Off to see Gordon Brown at Chequers again? Off to launch a fresh onslaught against the EU reform treaty via more Sun bursts and Times foaming about 'feral federalism'? Off to threaten a switch to the Cameron camp? You might say that this is Rupert as usual. But it isn't quite how Number One corporations act. It comes too damned close - on EU withdrawal, for instance - to blurring the line between market shaper and market chronicler. Buccaneers are fine as they scrabble to the top spot. Once they're there, though, they gather other debts - to society, as well as to employees and shareholders. Will the Number One Rupert do that? Don't laugh too swiftly. There are precious reputations on the WSJ to be cherished. It's not just what it writes, but what it does. There's an inherent, rather dated ludicrousness about Aussie/Americans telling British governments what they must say in Lisbon to 'save Britain'. There's a pole position to protect, and that 'R' word Mr Brown keeps invoking: responsibility not just for getting to Number One, but for making something of it in a world where biggest can also mean best. A master of all the surveys What was old Fleet Street like, daddy? Read Peter McKay in the Mail, son, and you'll see. It was rough, tough, cynical, funny. It knew how to hit the jugular. It followed no pat proprietorial line. Shove off, Lord Copper. McKay is the mind and pen behind the weekday Ephraim Hardcastle column, and throws more low blows there than any of his rivals. But he also has his own named slot on Monday mornings, where even Mail tails may be wryly tweaked. 'In general, don't believe any of the reports issued daily by university researchers,' he wrote last week. 'They exist mainly to produce headlines - yet they are not news. Just manufactured dross, used to fill space in the absence of the kind of stuff we prefer to talk about.' So to the next morning's Mail ... 'Dementia hits brightest victims hardest,' say researchers at Yeshiva University, New York. 'Putting on weight raises cancer risk,' say researchers at the National Institute in Maryland. 'Stress is a passion killer in 15 million bedrooms,' claim researchers for a stress charity. 'Broccoli stops skin cancer,' cry another batch of Maryland analysts. And 'Yorkshire men are the brainiest in Britain,' conclude researchers for Nintendo. Meanwhile, 'grandparents clock up 3.8 billion miles a year ferrying their grandchildren around,' add researchers for Sheila's Wheels, and 'stroking a spaniel' is the best way to release tension, according to researchers for some upmarket dog food. All that without mentioning surveys on obesity, booze and almost anything calculated to produce gloom. I cast no stones at the Mail here. We're all guilty, m'lud. But next time he returns to the theme, McKay might ponder new research suggesting 85 per cent of pots dislike kettles calling them black. Of changes and farewells As sad meetings go, it went off cheerily enough. The editor of The Observer stood on a table and told his assembled staff they were 'fantastic', producing a paper in brilliant sales and reputation nick - and that, in a new era of technological change, he'd be departing at the end of the year, handing over to one of his great friends and deputies, John Mulholland. John got up on the table, thanked Roger Alton for 10 glorious years and said the Scott Trust had given 'an unqualified guarantee' of Observer distinctiveness for the future, with no jobs lost as sports and news teams converge to keep websites whirring 24/7. It was gracefully, even eloquently done. And Roger, tripping into a metaphor about Paul Collingwood and lapdancing bars, couldn't have been better. Is that it, then? What's the inside story? The trouble for press commentators is that they have friends and loyalties too. I hired Roger on the Guardian 35 years ago. I was editor when John joined us. But if you want background blah about peripheral rows, you'll have to go elsewhere, because there is something simpler to register here. Roger Alton is a truly inspirational editor: a motivator who makes the drudgery of everyday newspaper life seem fun. Work for him or with him, and you always have a great, creative time. After huge turbulence when the Guardian rescued The Observer, Roger brought together a calm, confident team that does him proud. And it was Alan Rusbridger at the Guardian who effectively gave him that job. We know there are strains when dailies and Sundays join forces. We've read the Patience Wheatcroft memorial lecture. Let's hope convergence is everything we think it is; if you're going to lose friends along the way, then you want it all to be worth it. Age shall not weary them Ageism corner: Sir Menzies Campbell, appointed Lib Dem leader at 64, departed at 66 because he'd have been too old for an election at 68. He snarled a bit at the hacks over that. Meanwhile, back in medialand, Michael Grade (64) has just brought back Sir Trevor McDonald (68) to present News at Ten. Politicians are too old when they get a bus pass, but TV shows, moguls and much-loved presenters have no such problems. Discuss - preferably before Question Time with David Dimbleby (who is 69 today as it happens - happy birthday)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
