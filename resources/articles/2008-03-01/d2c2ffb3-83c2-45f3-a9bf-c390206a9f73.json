Boeing has enlisted a powerful crew of allies on Capitol Hill, some of whom are ready to protect the US defence company by blocking the Eads award through legislation. The Eads award would generate new jobs in America as well as Europe, but Boeing supporters in Congress make an unabashedly protectionist case for blocking the contract. Liberals and conservatives are joining forces to blast Eads for claiming an unfair advantage. The US government is in the midst of a World Trade Organisation challenge to launch subsidies received by Eads subsidiary Airbus, the primary beneficiary of the aircraft contract. In addition, Republican congressman Todd Tiahrt of Kansas singled out the UK's nationalised healthcare system as another improper benefit to Eads. \"We give advantages to the UK, to France, to Germany that we don't have in America,\" Tiahrt said. John Murtha of Pennsylvania, the congressional chairman who shares control of the Pentagon's purse strings, and his colleagues are slated to unveil a defence spending bill next month that may well include a provision stopping the Eads contract. That would set up a fight between Boeing backers and members of Congress from the Gulf Coast, where the Eads deal would bring the most US economic benefit. Tiahrt predicted he would have enough support to stop the Eads deal. But another pro-Boeing Republican, Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, said she is not yet ready to take such an extreme step. \"We need to get some answers before committing\" to blocking the contract, she said. Although Boeing maintains its biggest US presence in the home states of Tiahrt and Rodgers, several senior members of the House of Representatives committee that funds the Pentagon have hinted that they would oppose the Eads award. David Hobson, a Republican congressman whose home state of Ohio has been wracked by job losses, accused Eads of partnering with a US company to mask its foreign ownership. \"They're a fine company,\" Hobson said at a Wednesday hearing on the tanker deal. \"But they're a front for the French and their other partners, and a company that does have problems with cheating or whatever you want to call it.\" The clamour to cancel the contract also could have lasting consequences in the presidential race. Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have criticised the US military for choosing Eads over Boeing, but Republican nominee John McCain has stayed conspicuously silent. It is thanks to McCain that the contract competition even occurred. The original deal calling for the aircraft to be leased by Boeing fell apart in 2004 after McCain led a lengthy investigation that revealed corrupt entanglements between the company and the Pentagon. McCain often touts his undoing of the Boeing lease contract on the campaign trail as one of his key reformist achievements. But he has neither welcomed nor jeered the company's loss to Eads, angering some members of his own party. \"It's a little harsh, but [McCain] needs to decide whether we're going to outsource our national security to Eads,\" the Republican Tiahrt said. \"If it comes down to whether you're going to support American jobs or French jobs, I'm anxious to see where he stands on it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
