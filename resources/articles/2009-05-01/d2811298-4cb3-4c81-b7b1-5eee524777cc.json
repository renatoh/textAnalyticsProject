If your query is not one of those types, of course, it doesn't work as well. However, the query interface seems to be better than Google's, in general. Whether the particular results (ie sites found) are better than Google's is a different matter. The Behind Bing section of the Discover Bing site includes videos of four of the key players. This is also one site to watch if you want to incorporate Bing's API's in your products.

Microsoft liked it, and bought the company in August 2008. Bing also uses great technology from another purchase: Farecast. There is still lots to do, of course. It's obvious that Bing doesn't have the depth or freshness of Google's results, but that's not too surprising in a search engine that hasn't actually been launched yet. Also, Microsoft doesn't expect millions of people to switch overnight: Ballmer talked of years and years. If Bing can gain one or two percent of market share in the first year, Microsoft will be delighted. Update: Typo in headline corrected.
