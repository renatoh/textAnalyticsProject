While part of the New York City borough of Staten Island was named Wu-Tang Clan District this weekend, after the hardcore hip-hop group some of whose members hail from the area, a street in Los Angeles was named Obama Boulevard, after a certain president of the United States. Hundreds of fans braved steady rain on the east coast to mark the occasion on Saturday when the streets of the Park Hill section of Staten Island were dubbed Wu-Tang Clan District. \u201cThis is a great day where we have an opportunity to honor our own hometown heroes, the young men who put Staten Island on the map internationally. They overcame all types of challenges, to not only become rap artists and hip-hop artists but to inspire and challenge the music world,\u201d said local council woman Debi Rose. Rose tweeted: \u201cAaand it\u2019s official. The Wu-Tang Clan District is a celebration of their inspiration to the world \u2013 and a celebration of their home, Shaolin.\u201d As Clan members gathered on stage at the event to thank supporters, Cappadonna said: \u201cThe real value is in the love, to help you see all things clearly.\u201d Staten Island artist Gano Grills painted a street mural to honor the musicians. \u201cI never saw this day coming,\u201d said the Clan\u2019s Ghostface Killah, with footage of his speech popping up on Instagram. \u201cI knew we were some ill MCs, but I didn\u2019t know that it\u2019d take it this far.\u201d On the other side of the country, Rodeo Road in Los Angeles suddenly became Barack Obama Boulevard on Saturday, honoring America\u2019s first black president even if he hails originally from Hawaii and went to college in New York and Cambridge, Massachusetts (Columbia University and Harvard Law School). \u201cA lot of people will say it\u2019s just another street, but for me, being 15 years old, a black child looking up and seeing the name of the first black president in my own \u2019hood \u2013 that gives me hope,\u201d Thandiwe Abdullah, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Youth Vanguard, told the LA Times. The dedication ceremony brought thousands to the intersection with Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard, in one of LA\u2019s\u2019 historic black neighborhoods."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
