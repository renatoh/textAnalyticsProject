Turkey's impressive economic performance has attracted a flood of inward investment in recent years - close to $10bn-worth in 2005 - as multinationals have sought to cash in on the potential of a fast-growing country with a young population and a prime geographical position between Europe and Asia. European Union membership is on the horizon, albeit challenged by some member countries, and a solid reformist government is in power. Inflation has been brought under control, growth has been strong, at about 7 per cent, and a series of strong home-grown business has sprung up. 'If you look at the reforms that have been introduced, the Turkish economy is much more stable, and it's a much more attractive place for foreign investment,' says Robert O'Daly, of the Economist Intelligence Unit. But markets hate uncertainty, and as the Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, struggled to placate the army and tussled with the constitutional court in the capital Ankara last week, both the lira and the Istanbul stock market plunged. 'This reminds people that politics remains an important source of risk,' said Philip Poole, chief economist for emerging markets at HSBC. It's a reminder that many think is long overdue. With plenty of liquidity sloshing about in the world's markets looking for a home, central banks have become concerned that investors are leaving themselves too exposed to the unexpected, or as they call it, 'mispricing risk'. The Bank of England expressed concerns in its regular Financial Stability Report last month that a sudden reassessment of the riskiness of assets could have dramatic consequences. In February, after a seemingly innocuous hint from Beijing that the Chinese government could rein in financial speculation, Wall Street suffered its worst falls since 11 September 2001, and the shockwaves rippled through the world's markets for weeks. The long bull run in the world's markets has since resumed and Poole reckons the probability of an upheaval in emerging markets sparking a global financial crisis is much lower than in the 1990s. 'Since the Asian and Russian crises, reserves have been rebuilt - there's an idea of self-insurance.' But if a shudder of risk-aversion passed through the financial markets, all emerging economies would be hit, especially those, like Turkey, without a long track record of success. By the end of the week, the crisis had been averted, for the time being at least. But the fears for Turkey's stability had already led to sell-offs in other markets. For now, however, investors will carry on happily filling their boots. On Thursday alone, a consortium led by Hong Kong's Hutchison snapped up the port of Izmir, on the Aegean coast, for $1.3bn, and eBay revealed that it had bought a stake in its Turkish equivalent, GittiGidiyor.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
