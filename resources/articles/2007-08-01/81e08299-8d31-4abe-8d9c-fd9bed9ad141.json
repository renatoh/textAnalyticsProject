The Rhinos had won only one of their last four games and, when they trailed 16-6 at the interval, it seemed another defeat was on the cards. But a blistering second-half performance simply blew Harlequins away. In a match played in baking heat the judicious use of replacements was to play an important part. By half-time Quins had used seven of their 12 interchanges while Leeds had used only four. Tony Smith, the Rhinos coach, pointed this out to his players in his team talk. \"We were aware that the opposition had used seven subs at half-time and that's a fair investment to put into a 10-point lead,\" he said. \"I've no doubt they had to use those subs due to circumstances. It's hard to account for everything in a game. You make plans of when to use subs but we'd only used four at that stage, so we knew we had a fair second-half advantage just through substitutions and that's the way its gone.\" Brian McDermott, his opposite number, refused to elaborate on why he used so many interchanges so early but it seemed at first to have paid off. In a half blighted by 14 penalties Leeds looked badly out of sorts. They could manage only one converted try through Jamie Thackray and lost Rob Burrow with a rib injury. They also had Brent Webb sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle, during which time the home side built on an early Paul Sykes try. Touchdowns from Scott Hill and Mark McLinden, both converted by Sykes, gave them a 16-6 lead. But Leeds were a different side in the second half and three tries in seven minutes turned the game on its head. Webb made up for his earlier misdemeanour with the first, the substitute Jordan Tansey grabbed the second and Kevin Sinfield claimed the third. Harlequins found themselves pinned in their own half and, despite some heroic defending, began to wilt in the heat. The Rhinos showed no mercy, running in further tries through Gareth Ellis, Scott Donald, Jamie Peacock and Danny McGuire, with Webb rounding things off. Sinfield converted three with Tansey landing the other two and Quins' only reply came from a Danny Orr touchdown. McDermott is convinced his side can still make the play-offs despite slipping out of the top six. \"In the first half I thought we were very good. Defensively we were very good and denied them some tries but the tank was empty towards the back end of the game. \"Leeds came out of the dressing room white hot and showed up in that second half. Whatever Smithy said and did at half-time it worked because they came out with a bit more zip and a bit more enthusiasm. \"The play-offs are still doable for us, that's one of the things I talked about in the dressing room. I don't want to get carried away with what went on today. We showed areas of the game that can get us into the play-offs.\" Ian Lenagan, the Harlequins chairman, was watching the game but declined to comment on speculation that he is in the running to buy the Wigan Warriors from Dave Whelan.
