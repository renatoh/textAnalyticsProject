Zak Ov\u00e9, an artist and the curator of Get Up, Stand Up Now \u2013 which opens at Somerset House in London on Wednesday \u2013 believes black British artists are finally being properly represented in UK museums and galleries. \u201cThey\u2019ve acknowledged a place for us,\u201d said Ov\u00e9, whose father, Horace Ov\u00e9, is one of Britain\u2019s most celebrated black film-makers and photographers. \u201cThat always existed in music, but now it\u2019s open for the art world. \u201cThe horizons have broadened. Before, Africa was treated as something antiquated; African art was something old that you looked at in the British Museum. Black British artists were ignored, mostly. But now more institutions are opening themselves up to the contemporary artists, and showing contemporary life for people in the global diaspora.\u201d Ov\u00e9 pointed to the opening last month of Tate Britain\u2019s Frank Bowling exhibition, which gives the Guyanese-born British artist his first retrospective in the UK at the age of 85, as a sign of overdue acknowledgement. Set across multiple rooms at Somerset House, Get Up, Stand Up Now explores the development of black artists, film-makers and musicians in the UK, from Windrush generation pioneers such as the photographers Vanley Burke, Armet Francis and Charlie Phillips to contemporary artists including Grace Wales Bonner, musicians such as Gaika, and the film director Jenn Nkiru. For Ov\u00e9, the exhibition is also a chance to look back at the nascent black British art scene and acknowledge the artists who helped redefine the idea of being black and British. \u201cThese artists made work which really challenged what it meant to be British, and pushed the idea that this is a multicultural society and we needed to be validated within it,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of those artists weren\u2019t queueing up for a badge or an exhibition or acknowledgement. That was work they felt had to be made by any means necessary and the thing that was pushing that work was looking at who we were and how we fit in. In Get Up, Stand Up Now, I\u2019m interested in how that older work can inform the current generation about how to be brave and how to question our position again.\u201d As well as focusing on the early practitioners of the 1950s and early 60s, the exhibition also shows how their work set the blueprint for a later generation including John Akomfrah, Steve McQueen and Sonia Boyce, who all have work in the exhibition. \u201cI\u2019m trying to talk about where it began and the voices who made it possible, and asking what was pertinent for them and what is still pertinent now,\u201d said Ov\u00e9. \u201cThis is about the foundations of black British culture, my parents\u2019 generation were informing their peers that we are part of British society, like any other. They were enablers who delivered our culture into mainstream British culture, and now it\u2019s permeated into all elements of British life.\u201d He believes the current generation of black artists have a wider reach thanks to social media and the internet. \u201cIt\u2019s very fertile right now, and there are lots of reasons for that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the digital age, where you\u2019ve got a generation that can share work online globally. A show like this, it can be seen today by someone and then beamed out all over the world.\u201d At a time when populism is on the rise and the idea of a Britain divided along class, political and racial lines is growing, Ov\u00e9 hopes the exhibition can show the UK is a country that has meshed together many cultural elements and is ultimately better off for it. \u201cBlack British culture in this country is not separatist,\u201d he said. \u201cWe exist in British culture and we\u2019ve brought our culture and there\u2019s been an exchange. That\u2019s been constant and it\u2019s one of the things that makes Britain great.\u201d Get Up, Stand Up Now is at Somerset House in London from 12 June to 15 September"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
