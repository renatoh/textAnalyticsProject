Germaine Mason, born and raised in Jamaica and a former member of the same training group as the world 100 metres record holder Asafa Powell, has been picked to represent Britain in the high jump. Mason arrived in the country to train in Birmingham a few weeks ago and he qualifies for Britain via a circuitous route. His father was born in London, but lives in Jamaica, while his mother was born in Jamaica but lives in west London. That has entitled Mason to dual nationality, but he chose to compete for Jamaica and finished third at the world indoor championships in 2004. The financial advantages of competing for Britain were too hard to resist, though. Upon his arrival Mason was immediately elevated on to UK Athletics world-class performance plan, worth up to \u00a324,000 per year and access to a comprehensive support package that is the envy of the rest of the world. 'I have wanted to compete for Britain since 2000,' he said. 'But I was told I would have to miss the 2003 World Championships and 2004 Olympic Games, and that would have been too much.' Then fate took a hand. While winning his bronze medal in Budapest he ruptured a patella tendon. Unable to compete, he decided that was the time to switch and serve the two-year eligibility period required before he could represent his new country. Mason underwent surgery to repair the damaged knee and eventually returned to regular training in October 2004, eight months after the injury occurred. During this period he also split from Stephen Francis, the coach of Powell after the two fell out. He is now trained by Sue Humphrey, who guided Charles Austin to the Olympic title in 1996. Mason made a cautious return last season, his mind dogged by memories of the injury. 'A lot of people told me it's just a psychological thing and that I should just get over it, but they didn't do the surgery and go through the pain that I felt,' he said. The signs this season are more encouraging. He has jumped 2.28 metres and he hopes to return to close his personal best of 2.34m and then launch an attempt on Steve Smith's 10-year-old UK record of 2.37m. 'I want to win gold medals for the country,' he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
