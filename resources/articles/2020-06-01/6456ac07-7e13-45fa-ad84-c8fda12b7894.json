The former head of the civil service Bob Kerslake, the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the heads of the Trades Union Congress, Confederation of British Industry and the British Chambers of Commerce are among 350 influential figures wanting a \u201cfairer and greener\u201d economic rebuilding, and believe there is no going back to the past. Their call comes as a YouGov poll shows that 31% of people want to see big changes in the way the economy is run coming out of the crisis, with a further 28% wanting to see moderate changes and only 6% of people wanting to see no changes. It also showed 44% of people were pessimistic when they thought about the future of the economy, while only 27% were optimistic. Forty-nine percent thought the crisis had made inequality worse. Labour peer Lord Kerslake said: \u201cAs the country begins to emerge from the crisis, it is becoming clear that people want a better future, not simply to return to where we were before. As with big crises in the past \u2013 from wars to the Great Depression \u2013 it was universally agreed that there was no going back. \u201cAnd so we have to ask deep questions about what kind of society and economy we now want to build. The moment we are in is a challenge to us all: to governments, businesses, civil society and citizens. But it is a challenge to which, together, we can rise and build something better.\u201d The research, commissioned by the New Economics Foundation, was released at the launch of their \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d campaign. Other signatories include David Walker, the bishop of Manchester, Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the bishop of Dover, senior rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, and the heads of Oxfam, Shelter, Save the Children, the Trussell Trust, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. Frances Morris, director of the Tate Modern, has also signed up in a personal capacity. The campaign is calling for an economic recovery that provides more funding for the NHS and social care, tackles inequality, creates good jobs, particularly for young people, and reduces the risk of future pandemics and climate emergencies. Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, said: \u201cThe crisis has revealed a number of harsh truths \u2013 that our health and social care services had been under-resourced, and that longstanding inequalities have left too many people vulnerable. But we have seen what can be achieved when we are faced with a crisis \u2013 government can spend wisely, at speed and at scale.\u201d It comes as the Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, directly challenged the prime minister on his pledge to spend billions on the country\u2019s economic recovery, considering the scale of \u201cinaction and broken promises\u201d in the last 10 years of Conservative power. Starmer pointed out a raft of existing regional inequalities in spending per head for education and health in light of Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201clevel up\u201d the economy. Speaking ahead of the prime minister\u2019s planned speech on the economic recovery on Tuesday, Starmer said: \u201cFor much of the country, the Tories\u2019 record on building and investment has been a lost decade. \u201cMuch hyped plans such as the starter homes initiative \u2013 which built zero houses despite having \u00a32.3bn allocated to it \u2013 barely made it beyond the press release. It\u2019s been talk, talk, talk rather than build, build, build. \u201cOur recovery from the coronavirus crisis needs to match the scale of the challenge. It must be built on solid foundations. It has to work for the whole country and end the deep injustices across the country.\u201d The National Audit Office assessed the starter home scheme, which was to provide 200,000 houses for those aged under 40 with a 20%discount. They found legislation to take the project forward was never passed and not a single home of that type was ever built. Using Treasury figures, Labour poured more cold water on the pledged economic bounceback by highlighting the fact that seven of England\u2019s nine regions had experienced a reduction in public capital investment per person over the past 10 years. In Yorkshire, the east Midlands and the south-west, investment per person is still less than half that of London. Labour also claimed that all regions had seen a decrease in both health and education investment per person."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
