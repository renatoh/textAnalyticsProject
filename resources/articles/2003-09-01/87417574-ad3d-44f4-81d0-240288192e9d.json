Although consumers are now using the web to buy products and check their bank balances, many are still concerned that their electronic money may somehow \"disappear\". This perception is not helped by periodic stories of hackers removing funds from international banks, or members of the public unwittingly being able to access the details of other banking customers. But the real threat of online fraud is much smaller than most of us believe, according to Dave Smith, spokesman for Smile, the internet bank. \"The perceived risk is greater than the real one,\" he says. \"You are far more at risk of fraud if you hand over your credit card in a city centre restaurant, where it could be copied, than when you use it online. If a customer is the victim of fraud it will be the bank that picks up the tab, so you wouldn't lose out.\" Smile, like other internet banks, is reluctant to discuss security for fear of encouraging hacking activity, but says it uses a security system which scrambles all information which passes between customer and bank. \"In fact, it is easier to trace money which is stolen electronically than it is money taken from a cash machine,\" says Dave Smith. \"Everything online is audited so we know where it is going, and we have checks in place to maintain security. Although there have been a lot of stories about identity fraud, we have a number of procedures which we use to identify these fraudulent applications.\" Mark Maguire of Egg agrees that security is a \"taboo\" subject that is rarely talked about for fear of inciting hackers. \"If a bank stands up and says it is confident that its systems are secure then that is a challenge to the hackers, who will try to attack it,\" he says. \"At Egg we have a 100% guarantee that if there is a fraud that is not your fault, you will be completely refunded.\" He suggests that customers need to be aware that \"spoofing\", where hackers mock-up a site that is similar to that of a bank or e-retailer, is becoming increasingly common. \"Online fraud is becoming increasingly sophisticated, so it does pay to exercise some caution.\" Two years ago the Financial Services Authority (FSA) warned internet banks that they were not doing enough to protect themselves or their customers against fraud. Since then, many banks have reported tightening up their security arrangements, although the FSA refused to be drawn on whether it felt that the measures were sufficient. Dave Eacott, spokesman for the FSA, said: \"We do have conversations with the institutions about how they address the issue of internet security. The reason we do that is because in our own rules there is a requirement to have good systems and that extends into the IT area as well.\" Banks tend to be reluctant to report fraud or incidents of hacking for fear of the damage such news could do to their business. However, there are a number of measures that you can take when you are online which will minimise any risk of fraud. In the past the FSA has also urged customers to be less \"slapdash\" and more security conscious when banking online. Speaking at a conference on e-security several years ago, the FSA's e-commerce team manager said research had found that 40% of people banking online used the word \"password\" as a password, or a phrase easily guessed such as their name. Around 50% of people left their password typed in their computer. In fact, it is often customers who are the weakest link in the security system. A recent report by Egg found that consumers' carelessness with PC and internet passwords could compromise their personal security. The report found that over half the UK never change their passwords and the majority have only one password. Robert Schifreen, the UK's first prosecuted hacker and now respected security pundit, says: \"The internet is now one of the safest places to bank and shop if people themselves don't fall foul to a few common mistakes.\" The most common mistake was using the name of your children (23%) and partner (19%); these were followed by birthdays (12%); football teams (9%); celebrities and music bands (9%); favourite places (9%); using your own name (8%); and your pet's name (8%). So here is how you can reduce the chances of online fraud: 1. Make sure information is encrypted by the bank so that it cannot be accessed by a third party - you can check this by looking for a closed padlock or similar security symbol on your browser 2. Keep your password and your Pin number to yourself and don't write them down. Try to use a password which can't be easily guessed 3. Shop only with reputable companies, or check them out before you buy. Use a recognised high street company, or one of the many established online specialists 4. Make sure you can contact your retailer. Steer clear of sites that list only a Post Office box number or no address at all. If you are not sure, give them a call, and if you are still not satisfied, then don't shop there 5. If you are shopping outside the UK, check where the retailer is located. This is important, as you may not be covered by the Consumer Credit Act for shopping at sites outside the UK 6. Just as when you shop in the high street and save your receipts in the event that you need to return or exchange an item, you should keep a record of all online transactions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
