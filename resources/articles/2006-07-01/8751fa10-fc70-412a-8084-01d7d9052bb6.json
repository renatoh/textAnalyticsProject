According to the Daily Telegraph, this is a good indicator of the situation in Britain, where the average length of cohabitations is under two years, and only 4% last more than 10. In point of fact, and unusually, for a cultural matter, the US is not a terribly good indicator of the situation in Britain, neither as a mirror nor as a forecaster. I often wonder whether US godliness isn't a bit overblown (to distinguish between rhetoric and reality is difficult enough in oneself, let alone in another country); but whether or not it's faith-related, Americans have much higher marriage stats than the rest of the developed world. Their divorce rate is higher than ours as well, so it's not as if they're more suited, as a nation, to wedlock - rather, that it is a more common means of announcing your couple-status to the world than it is here. Their unmarried cohabitees, then, are a self-selecting sample, as they are everywhere - but unlike the UK, where this self-selection might mean \"I don't want to spend 50 large on sodding posies\", in the US it's more likely to signify a lack of will to commit in the long term. But let's imagine for the sake of argument that the Telegraph is right, that this study is meaningful for the British. I still don't know if this bumps cohabitation down to \"intense dating\", since my understanding of the US \"dating\" concept is a load of stodgy dinners with people you don't know very well and aren't supposed to sleep with (in many ways, like having an electrician round, only without the expectation that anything might get mended. So, still, like having an electrician round ...). The question is, though: is a cohabitation that doesn't last intrinsically less worthwhile than one that does? And even if it is, does that strip it of all value? Might people who are going to embark on a less than permanent relationship just as well stay alone? It's always been taken as given that children are best served by two-parent families (even though recent research by Peggy Drexler disputes this. She, funnily enough, is based at the same university, Cornell, that produced - and despaired at - these cohabitation figures. Maybe they'd all like to get themselves a wee ideologico-divorce). Leaving that debate for another day, let's focus on the childless. These statistics are delivered without reference to factors such as: how old were those involved? What were the circumstances of their cohabitation? Are we talking two 23-year-olds living like sardines in Manhattan, or a brace of 35-year-olds whose love turned sour in a colonial pile in Ohio? If they are mainly the latter, then yes, that is a shame, suggesting a creeping inability to accommodate one another, and growing preference for the sterile convenience of solitude. But what if they're mainly the former? What if these parting couples are cohabiting sooner, without long-term intent, without legal commitment, not because they lack the relationship backbone of yesteryear, but because they know the risk of splitting and all that it entails, and still, they'd rather stay together than live on their own. It is a myth that only duos of two decades' standing can engender civic spirit, and those who fall short might just as well be living in boxed solitude. The benefits of living in groups - to each individual, to the immediate neighbourhood, to the wider society, to the global impact of simply using less electricity - these apply to anyone who moves in with anyone else. They really deserve more credit, and less finger-pointing. zoe_williams@ntlworld.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
