The Perthshire village where I grew up has one of the few surviving Goths. As scottishmining.co.uk explains: \"The Gothenburg or Trust Public House movement originated as an attempt to control the consumption of alcohol in the Swedish city of Gothenburg. In 1855 a law was passed in Sweden making distillation of spirits at home illegal and the authorities in Gothenburg decided to award the retail spirits licences to a single company run as a trust. This trust aimed to control pubs and off licences in a way which would not encourage excessive consumption of spirits. 5% of the profit of the trusts went to the shareholders with the remainder being used to benefit the local community. In Scotland, the system was adopted mainly in mining communities of Fife and the Lothians.\" Catriona Graham Edinburgh \u2022 An entire editorial on community pubs without any mention of that great monument to Victorian self-help, the working men's club?

They have a duty to try to provide some educational activity, even if this is only the provision of books and newspapers. While the beer is generally cheaper than pubs, the club of which I am a member has also gained international renown for consuming half of the UK's total imports of B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine.
