The move is designed to prevent defaults and is prompted by the sharp moves up and down in metals prices this month. The chairman of the LME, Donald Brydon, warned last week of a bubble developing in some metal prices. LCH Clearnet, the clearing house for the LME, said it would impose higher margins from tomorrow. It is the second such increase in a fortnight and margins are now higher even than at the time of the Sumitomo copper scandal in 1996. Clearnet raised the copper margin to $25,000 (\u00a313,300) a 25-tonne lot from $14,575 and the zinc margin to $12,500 a 25-tonne lot from $9,200. News of the increases coincided with another volatile day in commodities markets. Most major metals, after falling when trading opened, finished the day higher. Copper rose by $50 a tonne to $8,260 after the LME's daily report showed a small fall in stocks. Global inventories of copper are reckoned to be as low as two weeks' worth of consumption. Robin Bhar, base metals strategist at UBS, said Clearnet's move was sensible after copper had experienced an extraordinary one-day price rise of 10% last week, followed by a similar fall on Monday. \"It was to be expected because the role of the clearing house is to guarantee contracts. It needs to have insurance in place because of the wild movements in price. It's a case of safety-first.\" Mr Bhar predicted more volatility. \"Longer term we are positive but ... when you look at the fundamentals in copper they do not justify $8,000 a tonne. We think a correction is due and $4,000 is more justified. The trouble is every time it dips there are lots and lots of buyers ready to step in.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
