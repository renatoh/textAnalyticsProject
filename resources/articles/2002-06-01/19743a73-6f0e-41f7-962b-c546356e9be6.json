The independent television commission has decided not to uphold complaints, including 12 from victims of child abuse, which claimed the ad was upsetting, shocking and had \"overstepped the mark\". In its latest quarterly report on TV advertising complaints, the ITC described the ad, made by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, as \"extremely hard hitting\". In the film, a cartoon character bounces back from his father's attacks. But when he is thrown down the stairs, the body of a real boy lies in his place. The endline reads: \"Real children don't bounce back.\" But the ITC agreed with the NSPCC's defence that the imagery was \"an effective means of communicating the seriousness of the issue and moving people to take action if they were concerned about a child\". Five viewers said the ad suggested only men abuse children and several other viewers said that, while raising awareness of child abuse was important, they felt the film's treatment of the issue had overstepped the mark. Although it acknowleged the ad was more hard-hitting than any of the NSPCC's previous campaigns, the ITC acknowledged the charity had \"taken a great deal of care\" to minimise distress in its film, which was only shown after the 9pm watershed. The NSPCC and the ITC sympathised with viewers who found the ad upsetting - particularly those with personal experience of abuse - but felt that it was justified."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
