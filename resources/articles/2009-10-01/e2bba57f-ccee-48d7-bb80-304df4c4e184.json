The aim is to engage young people who tend to have a high level of need, but who are not accessing the services available. The programme is diverse, responding to what young people themselves say. So they have made films about the issues affecting asylum seekers, organised a Kick Islamophobia football tournament and led a conference attended by everyone from CEOs to local imams to talk about what is important to them. They are campaigning to make Islington a better place, and to paint an alternative picture of Muslims and young people. My project is part-funded the by Preventing Violent Extremism initiative, and that makes it tricky. It's good that money is being invested in these communities, and obviously the government has to deal with issues around terrorism, but my young people are stopped and searched seven times a week. It makes them feel like outsiders. At the same time, a lot of young people find it hard to identify with their ethnic community. The older generation don't really understand the different ways in which young people are pulled. Some are slipping through the net and it's everyone's responsibility. For me the project isn't about faith, but about community empowerment and human rights. It's about celebrating diversity and multiculturalism at a time when they are perceived as a threat. So watching young people become strong, positive role models in the community is fantastic. Other councils are asking what we are doing, and how we are doing it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
