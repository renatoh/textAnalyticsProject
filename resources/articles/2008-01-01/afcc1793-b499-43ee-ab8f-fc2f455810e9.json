She is elderly, confined to a motorised wheelchair, frail, and almost entirely dependent upon her husband for her personal care. Yet the way she has reorganised her care, using a personal budget and a self-directed support plan, provides a model not just for the reform of social care but for many other public services. Brenda was not enamoured with her local authority respite services, so when Oldham council gave her the opportunity to take a personal budget she jumped at the chance. She quickly employed two market traders she knew as personal assistants and bought a car that could carry her wheelchair. Now, when she wants her husband to have some respite, her carers drive her to a market, often with one of her friends, and they go shopping. When Brenda wanted a longer break, she bought very cheap flights to Tenerife and booked herself and her carer into a hotel designed for people with disabilities. The trip was cheaper than going to Oldham's specially designed respite care centre, and she gets personalised services at a lower cost than a standard care plan devised by social workers. Self-directed service turns traditional public services on their head. In social care, for example, if someone is eligible for local authority funding, social workers devise a care plan that allocates the individual to services that are paid for and are commissioned by the local authority. It is rare for the individual to have much of a say in how services are designed, but self-directed services put the person at the centre of the action. Professionals help an individual assess their eligibility, and the person is then given an approximate budget so they can design services that make sense for them. Once the plan is approved by the authority, the money flows to the individual and on to the service providers of their choice. People who were once merely recipients of services become participants in planning and commissioning the services that support them. The people I spoke to said they became less isolated, depressed and dependent, and were more optimistic, energetic and confident. Professionals retain a critical role, but they become more like advisers, counsellors and brokers, guiding people to make better choices for themselves. The supply side of service provision has no option but to adjust more rapidly to user demand. In social care, this means a shift away from more inflexible, centralised, buildings-based services commissioned as block contracts - such as day care centres and residential homes - towards much more flexible, distributed, informal and decentralised provision, often organised around people's homes. It is still early days, but the signs are that this approach creates many more satisfied users at lower cost than traditional approaches. Chris Hatton, professor of psychology, health and social care, at Lancaster University, has looked at how 196 people who self-direct their support rated their performance against the goals for social care in the white paper Our Health, Our Care, Our Say. Almost half reported improvements in their general health and wellbeing. They also reported a higher quality of life, more time being active in their community, more choice and control over their lives, and greater dignity. Preventive effect For the most expensive services - such as packages for adults with learning and physical disabilities - the savings can be as high as 45%. A large share of the social care budget goes on devising and administering care plans, but self-directed services cut out much of this bureaucracy, and savings mean that more money can be spent on people with less critical needs. And there is a preventive effect: people said they are able to manage their conditions through care at home, without, for example, expensive time in hospital. This comes as publicly funded social care is caught in a spiral of rising demand from people with more complex needs, increasing costs, tight budgets and falling productivity. The default answer to this has been rationing. In 2004-05, the Association of Directors of Social Services reported that six in 10 local authorities provided services only to those with substantial or critical needs - in practice, people who cannot do the majority of basic things they need to do, such as bathe, wash, dress, cook and shop. It is also worth underlining that, as yet, the shift to self-directed services has not resulted in any large-scale fraud or misuse of funds. Nor do self-directed services widen inequality, as many on the left mistakenly allege. Under the current social care system, the articulate and vociferous are most likely to get a change in their care plan. And councils admit there is often a poor fit between what people need and the resources spent on them; people with very different needs get similar services because they are purchased as a block. Self-directed services make access more equal. People from ethnic minorities access traditional social services at a much lower rate than the population at large. In Oldham, ethnic minorities make up 22% of the population, but only 1% of people were using social services. When Oldham introduced individual budgets, that rose to close to 10%. The greatest inequity in social care is the gap between those who have choice because they can afford to self-fund their care and those who have to rely on poorly performing public services. Individual budgets offer state-funded clients the choices available to the middle classes outside the system, and that closes the biggest equity gap in the system. Personal budgets should be available to expectant mothers to commission their own maternity services, and to families caring for someone with a long-term health condition that includes significant social care, such as Alzheimer's or diabetes. Self-directed services could also work for people with mental health conditions, for the rehabilitation of ex-offenders and drug dependwents, and for job seekers who need tailored programmes to move off incapacity benefit. The recipe should also work in education - for example, in devising solutions for young people not in education and for whom traditional training or employment approaches do not work. The government has begun to embrace this approach with its concordat, Putting People First, signed in December, and results from the 12 individual pilot sites funded by the Department of Health will emerge this spring. But this revolution began in town halls across the country. The most effective new services are not being created by pointy-headed civil servants and consultants devising clever plans at the centre. This is a creative revolution being led by councils such as Oldham and West Sussex, and social enterprises such as In Control, but above all by people like Brenda. Over the last 10 years, public service reform has been driven by the ideas of a small cadre of policy-making crack troops in the prime minister's delivery unit and the Treasury. Self-directed services instead mobilise the intelligence of thousands of people to create better solutions. That is why it will be so powerful. \u00b7 Charles Leadbeater is a Demos associate.
