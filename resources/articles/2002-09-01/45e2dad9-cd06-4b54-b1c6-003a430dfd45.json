It involves an unseemly scramble amongst the legislature so that it is seen to be doing \"something\". The law is hastily tightened, with scant recourse to reasoned chamber debate or recognition of standard procedures, in order to respond to media and public outcry. Thus, the politicians' anxiety to be viewed as resolving the crisis overrides both established process and rational action. The result is predictably disturbing: enhanced powers to security agencies and the police; deviation from established principles of law; alienation of innocent, affected people; and disappointing results in controlling anti-terrorist activities. This is a formula that, once again, is evident both within the US and the UK as a consequence of the events of September 11. The experience of history In recent times the most striking examples of ill-considered legislation are to be found in the responses to terrorist activities. There is a strong and clear parallel between the current legislative processes in both the US and the UK. The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974 was subject to a mere 17 hours of debate in the House of Commons before its \"draconian powers\" were approved. Parliamentary debate was driven by the public outrage caused by the Birmingham pub bombings which resulted in the deaths of 21 people and the injury to a further 180. Brian Walden MP stated in the House of Commons: \"The justification for the Bill to my mind, is overwhelming, and I make no bones about the fact that I shall not listen with too much patience to any anxieties about whether this or that or the other civil right may temporarily be somewhat abridged. Let us be frank. The overwhelming mood in my constituency, and I believe in my city, is one of vengeance.\" A similar legislative response pattern occurred both in Ireland and the UK over the Omagh bombings in Northern Ireland in August 1998. In Dublin the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill was published on August 31, debated in the Dail on September 2 between 10 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. and thereafter in the Seanad on September 3, followed by an immediate quasi-presidential signing (this was because the President of Ireland was overseas). In Westminster a similar, complex Bill, which quickly became the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act, was pushed through Parliament in 27 hours. US legislative responses The principal legislative response to September 11 is the anti-terrorist legislation titled \"Uniting and Strengthening of America to Provide Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001\". This creates the powerful acronym, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. It is a monster piece of legislation amounting to 342 pages, covering 350 subject areas, encompassing 40 federal agencies and carrying 21 legal amendments. House Judiciary Committee chairman, F James Sensenbrenner, introduced the legislation on October 2. It became law on October 26. This was a record-breaking activity made possible only by forcing the pace to the point where serious debate and discussion was made impossible by the restricted timescale and the public demand for political action. In the Senate only Russell Feingold voted against the PATRIOT Act. With Congressional staff locked out of their offices due to the anthrax scare few members of Congress had time to read the summaries of the Bill let alone the fine print of the document that was passed in such haste. Indeed, what red-blooded American politician, with an eye on re-election, would vote against such legislation? The US Patriot Act In essence the Act creates, amongst other things, the following sweeping powers: \u00b7 Powers of detention and surveillance to the Executive and law enforcement agencies as well as depriving the courts of meaningful judicial oversight of the exercise of those powers. \u00b7 The Secretary of State is empowered to designate any group, foreign or domestic, as \"terrorist\". This power is not subject to review. \u00b7A new crime, \"domestic terrorism\", is created. It includes activities that involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal law, if it appears to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping. \u00b7 It permits investigations based on lawful First Amendment activity if that activity can be tied to intelligence purposes. \u00b7 It undermines the privacy protection of the Fourth Amendment by eroding the line between intelligence gathering and gathering evidence for criminal proceedings. It expands the ability of the government to spy by wiretaps and computer surveillance. It provides access to medical, financial, business and educational records and allows secret searches of homes and offices. \u00b7 It undermines due process procedures by permitting the government to detain non-citizens indefinitely even if they have never been convicted of a crime. The possible uses and outcomes of this legislation have horrified many constitutional lawyers and civil rights groups. Senator Patrick Leahy, the Senate negotiator on the Bill, said on the day it was passed: \"The Bill enters new and uncharted territory by breaking down traditional barriers between law enforcement and foreign intelligence.\" Morton Halperin, a defence expert, stated that if a government intelligence agency \"thinks you're under the control of a foreign government, they can wiretap you and never tell you, search your house and never tell you, break into your home, copy your hard drive, and never tell you they have done it\". For a modern nation created largely by immigrants the new laws covering non-citizens are ironically harsh. Section 412 of the Act permits indefinite detention of immigrants and other non-citizens. The reality of declared war experienced by President Roosevelt, which resulted in the incarceration of more than 110,000 people of Japanese origin, 11,000 of German origin and 3,000 of Italian origin, is now being replicated through the rhetoric of undeclared war by President Bush. Should it be thought that these detention powers are merely precautionary and unlikely to be utilised, the actions of Attorney-General Ashcroft constitute a sobering reality. He began by authorising the detention of 1,100 non-citizens. Some have been held for months and through Section 412 may be held indefinitely. The final illustration of the new wave of legislation is the Military Order signed by the president on November 13 which allow for non- US citizens suspected of involvement in \"international terrorism\" to be tried by special military commissions. These commissions are not subject to the regular rules and safeguards that cover military court martials. The president claimed that it was \"not practicable\" to try terrorists under \"the principles of law and the rules of evidence\" applicable in the US domestic criminal courts. These commissions are empowered to act in secret, to pass the death penalty by a two-thirds majority, and their decisions cannot be appealed to other courts. United Kingdom The ink was hardly dry on the Terrorism Act 2000 that came into force in February 2001 before a fresh commitment to yet stronger anti-terrorist legislation was issued by the Labour government. The Terrorism Act extended the powers of the police to investigate, arrest and detain. It created new offences allowing our courts to deal with terrorist activities which occurred outside our national borders. The moral panic that consumes the US is reflected in its most constant ally, the UK, which considers itself a serious potential target because of its political and practical commitment to US policies and actions. David Blunkett, Home Secretary, introduced the government's Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill into the Commons on November 12. It was a big Bill, containing 118 pages, 126 clauses and 8 Schedules. After a protracted House of Lords savaging, it became law on December 15. While claiming the powers were measured, reasonable and necessary on the day of the Bill's Parliamentary presentation, Blunkett laid a Human Rights Derogation Order, thereby derogating from the European Convention on Human Rights because Article 5 guarantees the right to liberty and prohibits detention without trial. The speed of the Bill's passage through the House of Commons was reminiscent of previous emergency legislation. The Bill was given its Second Reading on November 19. A timetable motion was passed which provided that the Committee Stage and the Third Reading should be completed in a further two days. The Derogation Order was debated for 90 minutes. The Committee Stage by the full House occurred on November 21 and November 26. It finished at 11.57 p.m. and was immediately followed by the Third Reading that was concluded at midnight. The Home Secretary spoke for three minutes and Oliver Letwin, the Shadow Home Secretary, responded by saying: \"I shall be brief.\" Indeed, he was. He was interrupted in mid-sentence for the vote that went 323 to 79. Royal Assent to the Act was granted on December 14. It was in the House of Lords that opposition to the Bill occurred. The Lords made 70 amendments and although most were reversed in the Commons, several were maintained and constituted significant defeats for the government. It was the issue of indefinite detention without charge that raised major opposition. A person reasonably suspected of being an international terrorist could be detained indefinitely and without charge. It was to cover \"dozens of foreign\" people, the Home Secretary claimed, who could not be prosecuted for insufficiency or inadmissibility of evidence, nor could they be deported if they faced either torture or death overseas. In December and January 2002 several arrests were made in London and Leicester. Detainees, who were not charged, were incarcerated in the London high security prison, Belmarsh. They were locked up for 22 hours a day and did not see daylight. On detention they were given access neither to lawyers nor to their families. They were unable to speak to families without the presence of an approved translator visiting once a week. They were denied prayer facilities apart from 15 minutes on a Friday but in the absence of an iman. Gareth Peirce, a solicitor who represents several of them, stated that \"these men have been buried alive in concrete coffins and have been told the legislation provides for their detention for life without trial\". The Rule of Law, equality and fairness are challenged by terrorists as well as by ill-conceived terrorist legislation. The police and the security services cannot be allowed complete freedom through law to tackle terrorists. The European Court of Human Rights has laid down limits. \"The Court, being aware of the danger such a law poses of undermining or even destroying democracy on the ground of defending it, affirms that the Contracting States may not, in the name of the struggle against terrorism, adopt what measures they deem appropriate.\" Thus, while terrorism is a threat to democracy, so the legislative responses of nation states, and the European Union, carry similar dangers. In the particularly sensitive area of terrorist control it is incumbent upon politicians that their decisions be considered, proportionate and appropriate and that both content and process accord with the principles of the Rule of Law. Neither the PATRIOT Act nor the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act meet these basic criteria. In 1993 a senior Labour politician stated in Parliament: \"If we cravenly accept that any action by the government and entitled Prevention of Terrorism Act must be supported in its entirety without question we do not strengthen the fight against terrorism, we weaken it. I hope that no Honorable Member will say that we do not have the right to challenge powers, to make sure that they are in accordance with the civil liberties of our country.\" The speaker? The Shadow Home Secretary, Tony Blair. \u00b7 This is an excerpt from an article that appears in Beyond September 11: An Anthology of Dissent, recently published by Pluto Press.
