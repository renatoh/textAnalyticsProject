Several Ethiopians present burst into spontaneous applause. For them, exiled far from home, the marathon man became a hero last month when he made the same X gesture as he crossed the finish line to win silver at the Rio Olympics. It was an audacious protest on one of the world\u2019s biggest stages against the Ethiopian government\u2019s persecution of the Oromo ethnic group, at huge risk to himself and his family. Facing certain jail if he returned home, Lilesa lay low in Brazil for three weeks and has now been granted a US special skills visa, allowing him to train and compete. But he has not seen his wife, five-year-old son and daughter, who is three, since 17 August, though they maintain regular contact. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look at my children any differently from the children of my country that are being killed,\u201d Lilesa, 26, told a press conference, in the US capital on Tuesday. \u201cThey face the same fate and destiny as all other children in Ethiopia. I do have a concern for my family but what I\u2019m thinking about today is not so much bringing them here, but change will come to Ethiopia so I can go home to my family,\u201d he said, through an interpreter Lilesa follows in a long tradition of political protesters at sports events, with examples including the black power salute at the 1968 Olympics and San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand during the national anthem in recent weeks. His use of the crossed wrists \u2013 used by anti-government protesters as a sign of peaceful resistance, and meant to symbolise being handcuffed by security forces \u2013 had been planned long before the race. \u201cI grew up witnessing the suffering of my people and this was not new to me,\u201d explained the son of farmers raised in a rural community. \u201cBut we have not seen what we are seeing now, with young children and pregnant women and elderly people being killed. The thing has got worse in the past nine months. \u201cAs soon as the Ethiopian athletic federation selected me to go to Rio, I decided that I needed to train hard and I knew the people were dying but no one was seeing or hearing their suffering. So I decided three months before Rio, if I get good result, the media would be watching and the world would finally see and hear the cry of my people.\u201d The strategy worked. Lilesa\u2019s gesture made headlines around the world and focused rare attention on human rights in Ethiopia, a US ally that hosted Barack Obama last year. But he knew there would be a heavy personal price to pay. Recalling the reaction of his compatriots in the Olympic village, he said: \u201cThe athletes cried. They sent me off with tears. I am not normally the kind of person who cries but they actually made me cry. \u201cThe federation officials knew they would get in trouble if they spoke with me but they gave me certain signs and gestures. They presumably had concerns for their safety.\u201d Lilesa stayed in a Rio hotel and expressed gratitude to the Brazilian authorities for guaranteeing his safety. He considered moving to Kenya but feared that it might deport him to Ethiopia. Instead, the US embassy in Brazil helped him secure a visa valid until January and he is likely to live in New Mexico or Arizona while he considers his options. \u201cI\u2019m an athlete. I run long distances. Running has allowed me to travel. Beyond that it has allowed me to be the voice of my people. Running is life for me. It is also how I make a living so I look forward to continuing to race and pursue my dreams.\u201d Lilesa insists he has no regrets, however. \u201cI would have regretted it if I did not make my stand and show my protest because, when I was in Rio, there was a prison fire in Addis Ababa. People were burned to death including my close friend, Kebede Fayissa.\u201d Ethiopia\u2019s authoritarian government has long been accused of human rights abuses. Oromos, the biggest ethnic group in the country, make up an estimated 40% of the population but few hold positions of power. As the government intensified the sale of Oromo land to foreign investors, protests began last November and gathered momentum. A security crackdown has seen hundreds killed and thousands arrested. Lilesa, whose brother-in-law was arrested at demonstration nearly eight months ago, told reporters: \u201cThe Ethiopian government is killing, imprisoning and oppressing its own people. The situation in Oromia, Amhara and Gambella region is deeply concerning at the moment. \u201cI\u2019m an Oromo, I grew up in Oromia, so I understand the suffering of my people very well. So far the government has opened fire on peaceful protesters who are asking for their rights and more than 1,000 people have been killed. Others have been forced into exile and been slaughtered in the deserts of Libya. Many more have become food for fish in the Mediterranean sea.\u201d The athlete warned: \u201cIf this situation continues as it is, I have no doubt Ethiopia is staring into the abyss. You are going to see a great tragedy unless the international community intervenes and helps bring about change in that country. \u201cI am personally very fearful this is going to take an ethnic dimension. You are going to see a Rwanda-like scenario where ethnic groups turn on each other. It is important the international community understands the gravity of the situation and intervenes so we don\u2019t have to go there.\u201d He urged Americans to lobby their government to pressure Ethiopia to respect international law. Last week, the US said it had raised \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the excessive use of force against protesters in Ethiopia and called for an independent investigation. Lilesa said: \u201cIf there is a regime change in Ethiopia and the people\u2019s demands are answered and there is an opening, I will be going home the next day. It is only a matter of time before the power of the gun will turn to the regime itself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
