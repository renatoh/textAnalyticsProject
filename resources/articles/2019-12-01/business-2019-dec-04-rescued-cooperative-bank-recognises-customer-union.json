The Customer Union for Ethical Banking said the agreement would give it influence with the Co-operative Bank\u2019s leadership, and help the group rally support for its long-term goal of returning the lender to cooperative ownership. The union \u2013 which has 1,200 members \u2013 grew out of the Save Our Bank campaign, which formed following the bank\u2019s near collapse in 2013. That year, the bank revealed a \u00a31.5bn hole in its accounts and had to be rescued by hedge funds. It was eventually bought out completely, in 2017, after a group of US hedge funds \u2013 including Silver Point Capital, GoldenTree, Anchorage Capital, Blue Mountain and Cyrus Capital \u2013 backed a second rescue deal worth \u00a3700m. Those funds, as well as asset manager Invesco, now hold an 85% stake in the bank. The lender also suffered a major blow after secret footage emerged of the bank\u2019s chairman Paul Flowers \u2013 dubbed the \u201ccrystal Methodist\u201d \u2013 that led to him pleading guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine in 2014. \u201cInitially there was a lot of concern. We were alarmed that the hedge fund owners were coming in,\u201d Ryan Brightwell, one of the union\u2019s directors, said. But Brightwell, a former Co-op Group employee, said the union had put pressure on the bank and ensured it stayed true to its ethical roots. Earlier this year, the bank agreed to reinstate a special external audit of its values and ethics report after the union raised concerns. That audit \u2013 which took place every year since 1998 \u2013 is meant to independently assess whether the Coop Bank is actually implementing its policies. \u201cWe do see a need for us to continue to watch closely,\u201d Brightwell said. The union is also hoping to bring the bank back under cooperative control. \u201cHedge funds typically don\u2019t stick around for the longer term, so we imagine they will eventually look to sell on their interest in the bank. That will be the point to be particularly active in advocating for the bank to return to cooperative ownership,\u201d Brightwell said. Co-op Bank\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Bester, said: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that we have a group of loyal customers as committed to our ethical brand as we are \u2013 and our regular conversations with the customer union are positive and very valuable in terms of understanding what matters to them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
