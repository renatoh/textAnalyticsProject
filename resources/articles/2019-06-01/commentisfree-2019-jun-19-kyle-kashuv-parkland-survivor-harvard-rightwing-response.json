The PC police\u2019s latest victim is 18-year-old Kyle Kashuv, a survivor of the Parkland shooting and a conservative activist. On Monday, Kashuv disclosed that Harvard had decided to rescind his admission to the class of 2023 after reviewing racist texts and comments he had made when he was 16. These comments were leaked online a few weeks ago and, Kashuv tweeted, led to \u201cformer peers &amp; political \u2026 contacting Harvard urging them to rescind me\u201d. After reviewing the case, the Ivy League university did just that. There is nothing particularly noteworthy or new about Harvard deciding a student hasn\u2019t acted in accordance with its internal policies and rescinding their offer. Indeed, the university rescinded admission offers for at least 10 prospective students in 2017 over offensive comments they had made in a private Facebook group called \u201cHarvard memes for horny bourgeois teens\u201d. However, Kashuv\u2019s status as a prominent social media personality means the school\u2019s decision to cut ties with him has quickly spiraled into a national controversy. And while I\u2019m not entirely sure a kid not going to Harvard should be news in the first place, the debate it has ignited says a lot about the current state of America. Let\u2019s start with the question of who gets to make mistakes in America. Kashuv said some truly horrible things in the Google Doc and texts that were made public: he used the N-word multiple times and boasted that \u201cim really good at typing nigger ok like practice uhhhhhh makes perfect\u201d. Kashuv, who is Jewish, also made derogatory comments about Jews. Kashuv has said he is embarrassed by his comments and has since matured: \u201cWe were 16-year-olds making idiotic comments, using callous and inflammatory language in an effort to be as extreme and shocking as possible \u2026 I want to be clear that the comments I made are not indicative of who I am or who I\u2019ve become in the years since.\u201d We have all said stupid things we regret; I\u2019m sure none of us would like to be judged by the things we did and said at 16. However, there\u2019s a big difference between \u201ccallous and inflammatory language\u201d and blatantly racist language. It\u2019s unsettling to see how many people are treating Kashuv\u2019s racist statements like they\u2019re no big deal, like everyone says that sort of thing. Ben Shapiro, for example, tweeted: \u201cHarvard\u2019s auto-da-fe sets up an insane, cruel standard no one can possibly meet.\u201d Really? When you consider not using the N-word a \u201ccruel standard no one can possibly meet\u201d you are truly telling on yourself. It\u2019s also interesting, by the way, that Shapiro didn\u2019t condemn Kashuv\u2019s antisemitic remarks; it\u2019s almost as if Shapiro applies his principles and outrage selectively. Shapiro wasn\u2019t the only conservative thought leader to rush to Kashuv\u2019s defense. The New York Times\u2019s David Brooks opined in a column: \u201cMoral formation is not like learning math. It\u2019s not cumulative; it\u2019s inverse. In a sin-drenched world it\u2019s precisely through the sins and the ensuing repentance that moral formation happens.\u201d While that\u2019s very poetic I also think it\u2019s worth reiterating that there\u2019s nothing particularly complicated about realizing the N-word is bad. Brooks makes it sound like figuring out you shouldn\u2019t be racist is some kind of epic struggle. Brooks continues to say that we shouldn\u2019t \u201cjudge people by what they did in their worst moment, but rather by how they respond to their worst moment. That\u2019s why we are forgiving of 16-year-olds, because they haven\u2019t disgraced themselves enough to have earned maturity.\u201d While I\u2019m entirely in agreement that we should give people the chance to redeem themselves, that nobody should be written off, I\u2019m somewhat flabbergasted by the fact he thinks America is \u201cforgiving of 16-year-olds\u201d. What he meant to write, perhaps, is that America is forgiving of white 16-year-olds. America is forgiving of youthful mistakes made by guys like Brett Kavanaugh. It\u2019s forgiving of guys like Brock Turner. It\u2019s forgiving of guys like Kyle Kashuv. It\u2019s not, however, forgiving of guys like Tamir Rice or Trayvon Martin. It\u2019s not forgiving of guys like Kalief Browder, who was sent to Rikers, New York City\u2019s notorious island jail, when he was 16 after being accused of stealing a backpack. Browder spent three years awaiting trial in Rikers island, half of the time in solitary confinement, because his family couldn\u2019t raise bail money. When he was eventually brought to trial a judge dismissed all charges against him; two years later Browder killed himself. Not everyone gets to be a child in America. Not everyone gets to make mistakes. In fact plenty of people are made to pay for mistakes they never even made. The right is obsessed with lecturing liberals on personal responsibility. However, as their response to the Kashuv situation demonstrates, they are not so keen on taking personal responsibility themselves. Actions have consequences, as Kashuv is finding out. He may not be going to Harvard in 2023, but the university is already teaching him a valuable lesson.
