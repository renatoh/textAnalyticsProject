Daniel Barenboim", "bodyText": "There was a restless spirit to this year's Reith lectures as Daniel Barenboim took them from London to Jerusalem via Chicago and Berlin. In five energetic, at times almost anarchic, addresses the pianist and conductor searched for purpose and meaning in music. He argued it should be something more than entertainment; a harmonious and beautiful force which can change the way people live. He has always been a creative figure, promoting debate and new music and never content to relax into the trappings of global cultural celebrity. As co-founder of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, with the late Edward Said, he has put his belief in the power of music into practice, bringing together Israeli and Arab musicians and coming under great criticism from some in Israel as a result. He ended his Reith lecture series with an appearance on Desert Island Discs, repeated on Radio 4 today, which reminded listeners of his remarkable life. Encouraged to perform as a boy by Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, he was celebrated as a pianist before becoming one of the great operatic and orchestral conductors, married to Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9, with whom he performed. Next week he takes up a new role as principal guest conductor at La Scala, Milan, while keeping his role as chief conductor of the Berlin Staatsoper. In an age when cheap recordings and pocket MP3 players make listening to music easier than ever, he reminds people that its purpose is to create passion and thought as well as relaxation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
