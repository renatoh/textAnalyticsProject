In a letter to the prime minister, Scotland\u2019s first minister accused the Treasury of sabotaging the deal by refusing to agree that a key principle was that the Scottish parliament would not suffer financially for taking on new tax and welfare powers worth about \u00a315bn a year. As she released her letter, she disclosed that her finance secretary, John Swinney, had been granted extra time for the negotiations by the Scottish parliament\u2019s devolution committee. The committee had set a deadline of 12 February, the day Holyrood starts a week-long recess, to ensure that MSPs had time to study and accept the terms of the deal before Holyrood is dissolved in advance of May\u2019s devolved elections. Sturgeon said the UK government\u2019s proposed formula, set out by Greg Hands, the chief secretary to the Treasury, would see Holyrood lose about \u00a32.7bn over the next decade because it failed to take account of Scotland\u2019s lower population growth. Spread over 10 years, that funding shortfall is equivalent to about 0.8% of Holyrood\u2019s likely annual budget \u2013 a figure thought to be the sum described as a \u201cmolehill\u201d by the Scotland secretary, David Mundell, last week. This was unacceptable, she told Cameron, and undermined the central principle of the all-party Smith agreement, which led to the new income tax and welfare powers for Holyrood being agreed in exchange for continuing, but lower, funding from the Treasury. Speaking at her monthly press conference, Sturgeon said: \u201cThinking about all the people, even the Conservatives, who sat around the Smith commission table, did anybody really think that they were signing up to the systematic or automatic reduction in Scotland\u2019s budget? But that is what the Treasury proposal on table right now would deliver. So if we\u2019re going to get a deal, it has to be on the principle of no detriment, as was set out.\u201d The so-called \u201cno detriment\u201d principle is based on a clause in the Smith agreement designed to ensure that neither Scottish nor rest-of-UK taxpayers lose out as a direct result of the changed funding for Holyrood, by over- or underpaying through a revised version of the Barnett formula. which sets the annual Treasury grant to Edinburgh. However, Sturgeon tacitly accepted that Scottish ministers could have made earlier moves to satisfy the Treasury\u2019s concerns about Holyrood benefiting unfairly from the formula preferred by her government. She said Swinney would make a fresh concession to the Treasury to guarantee that Scotland would not financially benefit from any tax increases in England designed to benefit England-only services such as the NHS. Sturgeon indicated that Scottish ministers agreed that it was unfair for Holyrood to get an extra share of any extra tax increases for England-only spending. Sturgeon told Cameron it was essential that the prime minister give her his assurance that both sides had the same understanding of what \u201cno detriment\u201d meant in practice. \u201cI must make clear that the approach taken by the Treasury so far \u2013 which seems to focus not on delivering \u2018no detriment\u2019, but instead on seeking agreement on the amount of detriment that Scotland should bear \u2013 is simply not acceptable to the Scottish government,\u201d she wrote. A Treasury spokesman denied that the UK government\u2019s position was in breach of the Smith agreement. \u201cThe UK government is absolutely committed to implementing the Smith agreement in full and in line with the no detriment principle. The offer we have placed on the table would have delivered more funding for the Scottish government than the existing Barnett formula since devolution in 1999,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the outset, our position on the fiscal framework has been clear: we stand ready to do a deal that is fair for Scotland and fair for the rest of the UK.\u201d Bruce Crawford, the devolution committee\u2019s chairman, said it hoped a deal could be reached in the last week of February, around the time it has an evidence session with Swinney and Hands on 23 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
