Pat Murphy's nine-year-old had his Martell Grand National odds cut from 14-1 to 10-1 by Hill's after staying on well in the closing stages under Leighton Aspell. \"He did all I'd hoped and expected, really, which was to go and have a race, not have too hard a time and run very respectably,\" said Murphy yesterday. \"He hit a flat spot in the race like he always does when the pace quickens up. They left him behind, but once he got back into the straight again he stayed on really nicely without having an unduly hard time. \"He won't run again until Aintree - I won't be tempted,\" the trainer added. Supreme Glory, who is set to carry 10st 5lb in the National, is joint-favourite with Moor Lane in Hill's book. Nicky Henderson yesterday reported both Bacchanal and Aon Chase third Marlborough \"fine this morning\" and the latter will head straight to Cheltenham with racecourse gallops set to form a key part of his Gold Cup preparation. \"We were absolutely thrilled with the way the horse performed,\" said owner Sir Robert Ogden's racing manager Barry Simpson. \"Ruby Walsh was confident he was going to take Bacchanal going to the second last but Marlborough needed the race, it's as simple as that. The horse jumped extremely well and travelled well. He just blew up in the closing stages. We are hoping we'll get some good fast ground for Cheltenham.\" Bacchanal will go straight to Cheltenham without another race. \"We've batted ourselves into a position. All we've got to do now is survive the next four or five weeks,\" said Henderson. Despite taking a walk in the betting, Copeland ran his rivals ragged in the Tote Gold Trophy to complete a double for Martin Pipe and Tony McCoy, who picked up the Game Spirit Chase with Lady Cricket. French novice Japhet lost his place at the head of the Royal &amp; SunAlliance Chase betting after going under to Frosty Canyon but trainer Guillaume Macaire was not panicking: \"Japhet was a little bit sick after his last run and went a long time without work. He will improve a lot and this was the best route to Cheltenham,\" he said. Japhet, who jumped boldly and was not knocked about, is now a tempting 6-1, from 7-2, with Coral for the SunAlliance. \u00b7 Rain threatens tomorrow's jump cards at Sedgefield and Folkestone. Both courses will hold inspections this morning, while overnight rain could lead to a morning inspection for Plumpton today where the going is heavy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
