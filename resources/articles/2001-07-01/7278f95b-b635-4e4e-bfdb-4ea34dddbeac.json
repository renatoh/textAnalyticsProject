For the past decade, the Essential team has staged this event in Brighton, but now \"the only dedicated dance and roots festival in the UK\" has moved to the empty expanse of London's Hackney Marshes, a bleak, inappropriate setting. This may have been a giant outdoor festival, attracting an audience of 15,000, but there was no central outdoor arena, and no outdoor music of any kind. Scattered across the site were nine large tents, and it was here, sometimes in semi-darkness and often in hot, overcrowded conditions, that the musicians appeared. The setting was not ideal, but the musical range was intriguing, with different tents offering jazz, soul, funk, reggae or hip-hop. It was like a condensed history of black music, but with Africa mysteriously left out and a dash of Latin and Asian dance thrown in. Jamaica has played a crucial part in that history, so it was good to find two reggae tents, and the best performance of the day came from the veteran vocal team Black Uhuru, backed by Sly and Robbie, still surely the greatest rhythm section in the world. Old anthems such as Solidarity were transformed by their tight, inventive bass- and drum-work. Johnny Clarke, another reggae star from the 1970s, proved to be still in excellent voice, and there was a reminder from the talkative Sizzla that the new reggae generation should not be ignored. Elsewhere, there were good sets from the Los Angeles Latin/rap band Ozomatli, from the Asian dance/fusion exponents Temple of Sound, and from Courtney Pine (who rightly drew crowds away from a limp pop/soul/dance show by Damage). There was also a thankfully strong performance from Gil Scott-Heron in the jazz tent. He looked gaunt and emaciated, but with songs such as Winter In America he showed that his unique blend of jazz, balladry and the spoken word are as elegant and thoughtfully angry as ever.
