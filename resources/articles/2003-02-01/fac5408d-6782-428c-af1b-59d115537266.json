This evening I will be looking at the way the new broadcasters - and in particular Sky - have developed, and how they might affect this digital future. I believe that the combination of various new technologies - in particular broadband delivery systems, personal video recorders with substantial memories and sophisticated intelligence, and micro-payment systems - could enable most of us to shop for our television programmes and products from home in much the same way as we now shop for books, magazines and newspapers from retailers like WH Smith, Waterstone's and the corner newsagent. We could pay for individual programmes, and subscribe to individual channels or combinations of them. There will be a number of purely-advertiser funded services, but many of these are likely to be much more obviously tools for the promotion of commercial products and services than they are now - what I have called Freesheet Television. I have argued that in such a world the role of public service broadcasting will be radically transformed. We should lose the licence fee for television (though probably not for radio), so that after digital switch-over the BBC would become largely funded by subscriptions, and eventually - if it so wished - by advertising as well: and that ITV and Channel Four should also be allowed to charge for their programmes if they wished to. In this way producers can get the maximum value from their programmes, and most viewers and consumers can choose freely from a wide range of offerings. However I have also warned that this - in my view highly desirable - outcome could well be thwarted by two major institutions - the BBC and Sky. Last week I discussed the issues that arise from the particular position of the BBC. This evening I will be looking at the problems posed by the way digital television is developing in Britain, and in particular the challenge presented by the dominance of Sky in pay television. To complete my trilogy of propositions: if the problem with free television is that none of us pays for it, and if the problem with the BBC is that we all have to pay for it whether or not we want it, then the problem with digital television is that we cannot just pay for what we want. Let me remind you of the analogy I used in my first lecture. If we cannot change the structure of the pay TV market in crucial ways, the future version of an electronic WH Smiths will be very unfriendly to consumers. We will pay to go into the shop, and only be able to buy a newspaper if we buy two or three others as well, plus a raft of magazines and books. In addition we will find that some of the most popular products are made exclusively by the shop-owner, who uses this monopoly to discourage you from trying other shops - not that there will be many of these available - while being able to charge you whatever he wants for his exclusive offerings. We would not tolerate such a situation in the press and book publishing markets. Tonight I will explain why we seem to be tolerating its development in digital television, and propose ways of preventing it reaching this unattractive conclusion. First, a brief account of the advantages of digital over analogue television. As a transmission mechanism, digital is substantially more efficient: it uses less power, and it can deliver many more services. It delivers a better widescreen picture. A digital receiver is a much more sophisticated machine than an analogue one; it can store and manipulate material on a significant scale, and if it is connected to a telecoms network, enable instant transactions. In the digital world, the traditional television set will effectively be transformed into a screen linked to a computer. Given these advantages and opportunities, it is not very surprising that around ten years ago broadcasters, equipment manufacturers and governments in the United States, Europe and Japan became enthusiastic about the potential of the new digital technologies. Broadcasters saw both the chance to transmit many more services cheaply, and the opportunity to develop very different kinds of services. Manufacturers saw the chance of reviving a flagging sector of the consumer electronics market. Governments saw all these advantages, plus the chance to exploit one of their national assets - the radio spectrum - in radical new ways, most of which might generate substantial tax revenues. However the introduction of digital television would need, not only billions of pounds of investment, but a novel kind of co-operation between governments, broadcasters and manufacturers, some of it on an international scale. The radio spectrum would need to be re-allocated, a lot of it by international agreement. There would have to be new technical standards, ideally agreed by all those involved - but these agreements would have to embrace the telecoms and information technology sectors as well as the broadcasters. Persuading viewers and consumers to join the digital revolution would be even more problematic. It was obvious that digital and analogue systems would have to run in parallel, sometimes for many years, which would be both wasteful and expensive, particularly for the broadcasters. Regrettably, we have only partially achieved a rational, co-operative policy - certainly in Europe. While broadcasters must take some of the blame for this (because there was no serious attempt to agree common standards), there were significant failings on the part of Governments and the European Commission. Part of this failure can be explained by the different ways broadcasting has developed in the countries of western Europe. There was sometimes an unhappy mix of corporatist policies and liberalising, free-market ideologies in the 1980s and 1990s, a combination which has had some very flawed outcomes - as here in Britain. However I think that the single most important reason for this failure is that in the European Union, shortly before the digital messiah appeared, we had a bad encounter with the wrong kind of technological John the Baptist. This experience so scarred the Commission and the member states that when they had to develop a European digital broadcasting policy they flunked the task. In Germany, Italy and Spain, Governments had broken the monopoly grip of the state-financed public service broadcasters in the 1980s by permitting the emergence of substantial private sector terrestrial competitors like RTL/Bertelsmann and Berlusconi's Mediaset. These grew rapidly, and became powerful rivals to the state broadcasters - unlike in the UK, where we deliberately prevented the emergence of a single ITV company to rival the BBC in size. The UK was unusual in refusing to allow the state broadcaster to carry advertising and therefore had to mitigate the negative effects of the ITV advertising monopoly by maintaining some commercial competition between the regional companies. A 1977 international agreement allocating satellite broadcasting frequencies to each country allowed Britain to introduce pay-TV in the late 1980s for the first time. In France around the same time a terrestrial pay TV channel was started - Canal Plus. Both countries intended these to be regulated national monopolies in the first instance. Canal Plus successfully played this role in France, but the plan didn\u00e8t work in Britain. The consortium that won the satellite licence here was BSB. Unfortunately for them, Rupert Murdoch, who had been prevented by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (the IBA) from running an ITV company in the early 1970s, decided to by-pass the UK government and the regulator by hiring space on the Luxemburg satellite, Astra, even though this used frequencies designed for telecommunications rather than broadcasting. In 1989 Murdoch launched the Sky pay-TV services in competition with the fledgling BSB. This competition - almost unique in the new satellite pay TV markets starting around the world - nearly bled both companies to death. Late in 1990 they were forced to agree a merger, though it was Murdoch who became the dominant shareholder, and it was his management that ran the new BSkyB. Just as important, the new company used the Astra satellite and the Murdoch pay technology. Thus, unlike what was happening in France, Britain's pay-TV champion would be foreign-owned and largely outside the national regulatory regime. Which brings us to John the Baptist. In the 1980s the exciting new technology was high definition television. The Japanese had been first off the mark with this, with an analogue standard; the Europeans responded by producing their own analogue HDTV standard, called HD-MAC. It was based on work done by engineers working for the IBA, the British commercial regulator, and subsequently developed by the Dutch and French electronics companies, Philips and Thomson; and it was supported by the Dutch and French governments and the European Commission. First the Commission mandated the underlying MAC standard for the European satellite broadcasters. (Thus this was the technology used by both BSB before it merged with Sky, and by Canal-Plus.) Then in 1992 it revised the MAC directive and extended its applications to high definition television. This ran into a fury of opposition from a wide range of broadcasters and manufacturers, some of whom had no wish to use this expensive new technology, some of whom were beginning to think digital TV was the future, and some of whom had no intention of putting Philips and Thomson in this powerful commercial position. It was an effective coalition (which in the UK united the BBC, ITV and Sky) and after a mauling at the hands of the European Parliament the Commission finally abandoned the MAC directive - and along with it any intention of trying to impose a technology standard in future. Although the abandonment of MAC was a sensible decision in itself, the experience had unfortunate consequences when Europe had to create a policy for digital television a couple of years later. There had to be a Europe-wide policy - but the Commission wanted it to be agreed by the industry, not imposed by Brussels. At the same time important Governments - particularly the UK, France and Germany - saw that digital would require very substantial investment, and they decided that only the big commercial players could or would afford it. Although they knew this would probably mean allowing the existing operators to develop proprietary technologies which they could use to reinforce their existing near-monopoly positions they decided to tolerate this and hope that the competition authorities would sort out any subsequent problems. In the middle 1990s this lead to another fierce fight between rival camps in Brussels and Strasburg. (In this instance the BBC and ITV were ranged against Sky.) The European Parliament did a creditable job in forcing the Commission and the member states to row back from their original plan, and place some constraints on potential monopoly power in digital broadcasting. Nonetheless the final directive was flawed, and had too many ambiguities at key points. As a result UK governments and regulators have been able to dodge many of the hard decisions about competition in digital television, and our pay television market - worth around \u00a33bn, and growing - continues to be dominated by a single vertically-integrated operator - that is, one that owns or controls both the production and distribution businesses. It has also meant that there are a number of competing digital technologies now well established in people's homes, some of which are incompatible with each other. As a result we have neither the benefits of monopoly - a single technology standard - nor the benefits of robust competition between a sufficient number of rival commercial operators. In my view this represents a serious failure of public policy on an issue of great commercial and cultural importance, which has occurred because successive UK governments have been unwilling to act effectively. It is possible that the new regulatory regime being created by the Communications Bill now going through Parliament will over time be able to remedy this. If so, the new people at Ofcom will have to do better than their predecessors in Oftel and the Office of Fair Trading, whose decisions in this area have so far have had only a modest impact on the pay TV market, and whose overall record has been unsatisfactory. Consider the most recent example. The result of the three-year OFT inquiry into the prices Sky charged its rivals for its premium sports and film channels was announced just before Christmas, to considerable surprise. Despite its preliminary finding a year earlier that it expected to find Sky guilty, the OFT eventually decided that there were \"insufficient grounds\" for concluding it had broken the law. Sky was deemed to be on the \"border\" of anti-competitive behaviour, said the OFT. Perhaps that was meant as a warning to Sky to moderate its practices - though that was not how its frustrated rivals seemed to take it. (Those that were still around that is - one of the original complainants - ITV Digital - had died in the meantime.) That is the less than brilliant policy background. Now I want to explain the commercial and technological reasons why the pay television market has developed in the way it has; why we cannot as viewers and consumers just pay to get the channels we want; and why the current market structures may well prevent the emergence of a true, consumer-friendly market for many years - even though the technologies exist that would enable such a market. Sky made three very smart strategic moves when it started its pay service in the early 1990s. First, it was able to control the key technology needed for satellite pay-TV services in the UK through its sister News Corporation company, News Datacom (now NDS), which had developed its own encryption system. Second, it bought exclusive rights to films and sport, the most attractive pay TV services. It then used these two powerful technology and rights assets to create a comprehensive retail package for satellite viewers which effectively eliminated the possible emergence of any satellite competitor. Sky was able to ensure that almost every pay TV channel had to join the Sky satellite package on its terms. When satellite television first started, nearly all channels were financed by advertising, and people bought dishes from different manufacturers. When Sky set up a subscription service it provided the dishes itself and ensured these could effectively receive only services which were encrypted using the News Datacom technology. This gave it the whip hand over any channel wanting to generate subscription revenues - which, given the losses they were sustaining, soon came to mean nearly all of them. Even the powerful American operators like MTV and Disney had to join the new regime on Sky's terms eventually. At the same time Sky made sure that rival cable (and, later, terrestrial) pay operators could only get the Sky premium sport and film channels on highly disadvantageous terms. (And these were of course the services that prompted most people to think about getting pay TV.) Though Sky created this business model in the analogue world of the early 90s, it has successfully migrated it to what ought to have been the far more competitive digital world of today. The result has been that there has been no effective competition either within the UK satellite market, nor between different pay-TV operators, particularly in the provision of alternative film and sports channels. Sky has undoubtedly been better organised and better managed than its rivals, but it has also been extremely ruthless in its behaviour. Indeed, given that the cable companies have to offer their viewers the Sky film and sport channels more expensively than Sky does, the only reason that they have been able to compete at all is because they have been able to combine TV and telephone services in retail packages that do have some real value to potential customers. The two big ITV companies, Carlton and Granada did eventually try to challenge Sky's domination of pay TV sport, by creating a rival channel - ITV Sport - based on their exclusive rights to the European Champions league and the Nationwide football league in the UK. However they were unable to agree terms with either Sky or Telewest, the second cable company, to carry this new service, though they did reach agreement with ntl. This inevitably meant that the financial calculations on which they had acquired these rights were completely undermined. ITV's subsequent failure to persuade the Nationwide league football clubs to renegotiate the terms of their agreement last spring not just lead to the collapse of the ITV Sport channel but was an important factor in the collapse of ITV Digital, the terrestrial pay TV platform, as well. So instead of competition between three digital platforms - satellite, cable and terrestrial - as the Government had intended, we now have only two pay TV contenders. And, with the enormous debt burdens ntl and Telewest have incurred, the cable companies are not - at the moment at least - providing much competition to Sky either. While there are serious consequences for the development of the broadcasting industry arising from Sky's unchallenged dominance of the pay television market, it is the consequences for viewers that I want to concentrate on. Why exactly is there a problem? After all, Sky's services are clearly popular - more than six million people subscribe to them, and a good number of these could have chosen a cable competitor if they had wanted to. No-one is obliged to watch pay TV; indeed over half the country, after a decade of expensive marketing from pay TV operators, has chosen to do without it, and all the current evidence is that a significant number say that they will never want it. I have two serious difficulties with this. The first is that it is disingenuous to suppose that we do not need to worry about the position of the six million Sky subscribers. They have to swallow whatever price increases Sky imposes - if they don't like them they have nowhere else to go to get the services at a lower price. Sky has seen off one competitor - ITV Digital - and can prevent its cable rivals from offering lower prices than it does. It is surely a highly unsatisfactory situation for consumers where the only choice is to like it or lump it. And why do Sky (or indeed cable) viewers have to accept a situation where they cannot buy whatever mix of channels and services they want? Three quarters of Sky subscribers pay for a premium package - one that includes either films or sports. Yet, even though it is to get these services that they sign up for pay TV in the first place, they cannot buy the films or sports channels on their own. The reason is straightforward. Sky does not make much of its profits from these premium services; it makes them from all the other channels in the basic tier, which all pay viewers have to subscribe to in one form or another. If people could choose simply to buy the sport or film services, Sky's business would have to be seriously restructured. This is well known to the competition authorities, who are supposed to look after the interests of the consumers in these matters. So why have they accepted this situation? There have been two main reasons. The first is that they believe Sky is entitled to recover the cost of the two billion pounds it has invested in moving to digital over the past six years. Second, that the consumer has benefited from the practice of bundling channels, and from requiring those who want to watch premium channels to pay for the basic tier first. The argument is that without such compulsion, many of these channels could not have established themselves. In this way consumer choice has overall been enhanced by the great increase in the number of TV channels available, even if individuals are paying for scores of channels they never watch and would never dream of watching. These are reasonable propositions, but implicit in them is that there must come a time when neither any longer applies. Sky will soon have paid off its debts and will be making handsome profits. At some point the 200 or so pay channels currently retailed by Sky should be expected to stand or fall on their intrinsic appeal to consumers. We will now have to wait to see how soon Ofcom chooses to get involved in these matters. There was one modest intervention by a regulator in 1998 when the Independent Television Commission (the ITC) conducted an inquiry into bundling, in part at the suggestion of the European Commission which had received a complaint from the cable companies about their relationship with Sky. The ITC didn't regard the practice as anti-competitive per se, but ruled that the platform operators should offer smaller \"basic\" packages to consumers. This was opposed by Flextech, one of the biggest suppliers of basic channels to both Sky and the cable companies, and which did not like the idea of losing its 100% coverage and the revenues that went with this. It went to judicial review - the ITC was supported by the platform operators - and lost. This small dent in the existing practices did not change the underlying pay-TV situation. It is, as I once suggested to members of the Competition Commission in a DTI seminar, a bit like going into a supermarket to buy a chicken, and being told you could only have the chicken if you bought soap powder, fruit juice, an assortment of pickles, frozen pizza, a bottle of shampoo, a packet of bin liners and a block of ice cream as well. They said they hadn't thought of it like that, which didn't seem much of an answer. The issue of unbundling channels and enabling true consumer choice is the more important because in the all-digital future the majority of us are likely to get our TV programmes from Sky, ntl/Telewest, and BT's broadband network rather than via terrestrial networks, though these could be the main providers to the second and third sets in people's homes. The good news is that BT are already trying to create a broadband market where people can make small transactions, costing only a few pounds or even pence - a micro-payment system. (Such systems are now well established in Germany, and are increasingly popular). Sky's most advanced receiver - Sky-Plus, which includes a powerful personal video recorder - has a slot which could be used for such payments, though the company has not yet found a viable business model for this kind of transaction. And it could also be the case that there will be some households where satellite will be the only way to receive any digital services. Even for the public service broadcasters (BBC, ITV and Channel Four) it is unlikely to be economic for them to replicate in digital the existing analogue network of 1100 transmitters, though they might choose to go some way towards this for strategic reasons. (That is to maximise the number of people who can choose not to switch to satellite or cable distributors.) This is a matter of fierce debate at the moment, as Parliament considers the so-called \"must carry/ must offer\" clauses in the Communications Bill. The Government intends to make sure that everyone who currently gets BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel Four will be able to get them in digital, whatever platform they choose - or, more importantly in this case, are forced - to use. This does not present any difficulty in cable, where the cable companies have been obliged to carry these channels for free for many years. However it is not the case on satellite, where the public service channels have to be encrypted, and use a customer management service to provide the smart cards needed to decrypt the signals. Sky charges for use of the encryption - the conditional access system - and, according to the public service broadcasters, charges them far too much. (\u00a317m a year for ITV, \u00a34m for the BBC). Oftel - the current regulator - has recently rejected ITV's efforts to get its charges reduced, since it regards them as \"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\" - the conditions required by the European directive I mentioned earlier. ITV thought that as a public service broadcaster with obligations to provide a universal service and a diverse range of high quality services put it on the same footing as the BBC, and that the substantial differential in the annual charge - \u00a313m a year - could not be described as fair reasonable and non-discriminatory. However in the arcane world of the UK competition authorities, this wasn't so. Oftel decided it was perfectly OK to distinguish between different types of public service broadcaster, and to take account of the fact that the BBC struck its deal when Sky's digital service was relatively new - while ITV waited for four years to put its services on satellite, largely because it was trying to establish a rival terrestrial digital platform. You might have thought that that this judgement would have suited the BBC, but it doesn't. The BBC has to renegotiate its payments with Sky this spring, and it fears that Sky will increase them substantially - with the likelihood of little redress from Oftel if it does. The BBC doesn't seem to have much confidence in the way Oftel goes about its calculations, and has joined with ITV and Channel Four in trying to get the new Communications Bill to provide some assistance to the public service broadcasters in future. In the new Bill, the Government proposes to force the public service broadcasters to put their channels on satellite - removing their existing ability to refuse to do this. This is the so-called \"must offer\" requirement. However the price which Sky charges to carry these channels will still be left to commercial negotiation, with right of appeal to Ofcom - which will be the new regulator from the end of this year - if necessary. Understandably, on the basis of the ITV experience with Oftel, the public service broadcasters do not find this very reassuring. They are seeking to amend the legislation to oblige Ofcom to get better terms for them if necessary - on the grounds that they are not using satellite to run a business, like all the other pay channels, but to fulfil their public service obligations to provide a universal service. In theory, the terrestrial broadcasters - since they don't charge viewers to watch their programmes, which is the main reason for encryption - could transmit their signals unencrypted (as channels like ITV News already do) and thus avoid paying Sky these sums. However if they wish to prevent the \"wrong\" regional viewers getting a particular regional service - that is, one that can't receive at the moment through their analogue TV sets - they feel they still need to encrypt. This is particularly so for ITV and Channel Four, where advertisers value the chance to choose to target their campaigns at individual regions, and pay good money to do so. This means ITV and Channel Four have a poor bargaining position with Sky in the period before switch-over, and that both they and the BBC will have none at all after it. It gets worse. They will also have to pay Sky to issue smart cards to those people who have satellite receivers but don't want to subscribe to the pay services. (Interestingly there are already several hundred thousand such households - people who have got the dish and the box but have subsequently chosen to give up the pay services, while still watching the free channels.) Again, the broadcasters are at the mercy of Sky as far as the charges for providing these cards - and the frequency with which they need to be changed - are concerned. I apologise for going into this complicated argument in this amount of detail, but it demonstrates the peculiar difficulties that have arisen from the particular way the pay TV market has developed in the UK - that is with a dominant vertically-integrated operator with a great deal of power to impose its terms on suppliers and customers alike. One aspect of Sky's treatment of its suppliers that causes particular frustration is that the latter have no idea who is paying to receive their services. The list of subscribers is owned by Sky and is not made available to any of the pay channels that it retails. Thus Channel Four does not know which satellite viewers take Film Four, for example - unlike print magazines and journals, which have a direct relationship with all their subscribers and take care to nurture them. Sky's behaviour also contrasts with that of British Telecom, which lets the businesses which use its broadband services know who their customers are. One final example of what I regard as a regressive trend in satellite pay television. As Sky starts to renegotiate the terms on which it pays subscriber fees to its supplier channels, it is in general reducing them substantially. (It is not, of course, passing these reductions on to its subscribers.) It can do this because pay TV channels depend on Sky for their existence, and have little bargaining power. This in turn makes them more reliant on advertising income. As I argued two weeks ago, I believe we need to be moving in the opposite direction, towards a world where most channels and programmes are at least in part paid for directly by the consumer. Only in this way can we develop a conventional market where people can freely choose what they want to spend their money on. Sky's interest is indeed to get people to pay more - but more to Sky, not anyone else. This feature of the pay TV market - that the platform operator determines the price paid by the subscriber for a channel as well as the price the operator will pay to the channel - needs to be reformed if we are to enable the producers of programmes and the channel providers to deliver better quality television in the digital era. Newspapers and magazines determine the price at which their products are sold in the shops. The situation is different in book publishing, where the abolition of the net book agreement a few years ago has meant that booksellers can discount the price at which some books are sold. But the booksellers can't drive the price they pay the publishers down too far - there is sufficient competition between them to give the publishers some protection. Similarly in telecoms. Suppliers to the new broadband micro-payment market that BT set up last year choose the price they wish to charge for their products. BT charges them a service fee on a sliding scale based on volume of traffic. It is vital that pay-TV operators are required by the regulators to move in this direction - otherwise there is far too little reward for quality. The current structure - of a vast number of so-called basic channels and a handful of premium ones - is crude: consumers cannot express much of a preference between the different channels, nor express that preference through a willingness to pay more for those they want most. From Sky's point of view, this is an excellent situation, and if you were Sky you would have little wish to change it. And that is why I doubt whether we will be able to move to the kind of market I described at the beginning of this lecture - where you can buy what television you like in a way which most suits you - without much more serious legislative or regulatory intervention than we have seen hitherto. So what needs to be done? The first thing is that Ofcom should early on its life as the new comprehensive regulator revisit - and hopefully reform - the unbundling and buy-through practices that the ITC left in place four years ago. Sky is now profitable - it no longer needs the economic prop of forcing viewers into the basic and premium packages that it has operated for more than ten years. It is likely that, if present practice were changed in this way, some of the current channels with very low viewing figures would not survive. So what? The multi-channel world is securely established. By all means let a thousand channels bloom, but let them survive on their ability to win customers and audiences. The second reform is tighter regulation of the pricing structures of pay TV, so that the platform operators - Sky and the cable companies - cannot solely determine the price at which channels - and in due course, individual programmes - are sold. The existence of this feature is of particular concern in the television market. Here there are only a couple of retailers; the suppliers are in a particularly weak bargaining position, and the operator can force the supplier to rely on an alternative source of funding through selling advertising. For democratic and cultural reasons we need to ensure diversity and quality of supply: leaving this to the commercial judgements of a handful of platform operators is unlikely to be enough to guarantee these crucial outcomes. Fairly obviously, if the BBC is ever to switch from the licence fee to subscription, it will need to get access to the Sky subscribers on a different basis to that offered by Sky to its channel suppliers at the moment. The BBC would rightly want to decide how to bundle its channels together, how to set the subscription charges, and to have direct contact with those paying to watch its services. The third reform is for Ofcom in due course to consider whether to require Sky to separate carriage - its business as a platform operator - from content - its business as a channel provider - Sky Sports, Sky One, and so on. This move was advocated by the BBC, Channel Four and the Guardian in the run up to the Communications Bill. (The draft Bill does not mention this specifically, but Ofcom and the Competition Commission together probably do have the power to do this). Such a separation would turn the Sky satellite platform into something more like a common carrier, with no opportunity for bias towards its own channels and against others designed to compete with them for audiences and revenue. This would be a drastic move; and perhaps the mere prospect of it would persuade Sky to abandon today's world of channel bundling and buy-through to premium channels. But, then again, perhaps it wouldn't. I do not envy Lord Currie and his new Ofcom commissioners the difficulties they will face if they decide to enable the viewers of digital television to pay only for the channels they want to watch, not dozens and dozens that they don't. Nonetheless, we have to hope they have the stomach for it.. In my final lecture next week, I want to look more closely at the key technologies that will enable the real market to develop; but also at one feature of the new media world which I have not so far discussed: piracy. Making sure that those who create the products we will use in the digital world can prevent the hackers and bootleggers from destroying their ability to get paid for them is an essential requirement, not just of the more perfect market I am advocating, but of the continued prosperity of our existing production and distribution systems. However we also need to prevent the film and TV companies from strangling the new world at birth by adopting excessive counter measures. Most importantly, I want to address the social and cultural questions that will arise from a movement towards a conventional market, and to try to persuade you that abandoning our long-standing commitment to high quality public service broadcasting, available at low cost to all, is not only inevitable but can be done in a way which makes it politically acceptable. I hope to see you next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
