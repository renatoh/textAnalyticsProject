Obama spent less time talking about the specific civil rights history that paved the way for his presidency than one might have expected, although he didn't really have to press the point: hearing and seeing an African American man taking the presidential oath, in addition to witnessing the millions of people of all races and nationalities who stood side by side in support of him was evidence enough of that. If anyone needed reminding though, the poignancy of the fact that \"a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before [us] to take a most sacred oath\" was not lost on anyone. Obama's references to change and hope \u2013 the themes that resonated so strongly with American voters during the campaign \u2013 were firmly grounded in the serious challenges that he and the country face as he steps into his new role. He is well aware that he has inherited a malfunctioning economy and destructive international conflicts which are yet to be resolved and that must be handled with extreme care. \"The challenges we face are real,\" he starkly warned. He seemed unafraid, however. Despite criticisms that his speech is lofty and his goals over-ambitious, his determination to make a reality of everything that he has promised is clear. He also made it clear during his speech, however, that he cannot do it alone. Most significantly, you see, underpinning President Obama's inaugural speech was a call to action to American people. \"For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies,\" the new president said. In every reference made to the past and in every plan and vision set out for the future, Obama emphasised his view that the progress of America and any forthcoming change is \u2013 and has always been \u2013 as much about the American people, the nature of American society and the values and ideals that underpin it as it is about the nation's government. For Obama this means a more responsible America, which as a nation has a less arrogant way of dealing with the world and doesn't take its greatness for granted or misuse its power. It goes without saying that there are many in the world \u2013 Obama talked specifically about the Muslim world in his speech \u2013 who will have been pleased to hear that and are looking forward to seeing America take that new approach, which is so markedly different from the aggressive ways of George Bush. This also means a more thoughtful and reflective American individual who will continue to \"take in a stranger when the levees break \u2026 and who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job.\" Obama's campaign was built on people power and today he made it clear that it is that same power that will help lead America, under his presidency, become an even greater nation. He is also, unlike his predecessor whose legacy is considered to be overwhelmingly negative, deeply concerned about the America that will be left to future generations. The actions and attitudes of this generation matter to him and it is time for this generation of Americans to \"reaffirm [America's] enduring spirit; to choose our better history\". The generation that Obama has touched and impacted in such a monumental way during his campaign is the one that he now needs to continue in its desire for values-based action, and to also live a values-based life, in order to make significant progress. For the next four years, America \u2013 and the world \u2013 will watch Obama in action. Whether or not he is able to deliver the change he has promised and whether or not his actions will please the American people remains to be seen. The success of his presidency will be determined primarily by how he deals with the current circumstances that America finds itself in. However, as I stood in the crowd today, listening to Obama speaking, I heard a president who is thoughtful, reflective, conscious and aware while also pragmatic \u2013 \"the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works\" and grounded in reality. He knows it is whether or not his government works, and not just his words of inspiration, that will determine his success. This president told the world today that he is determined to ensure that both he, his team of officials and the people that he leads are different \u2013 and better \u2013 than that of the past. He wants to lead, and he wants Americans to work with him on that. This generation has as much responsibility in the future of America as the new government does. And that can only be a good thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
