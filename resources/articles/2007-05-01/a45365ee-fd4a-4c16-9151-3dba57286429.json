An investment arm of Dubai Investment Capital (DIC) has taken a \"substantial\" stake in HSBC through a new fund which aims to target international companies. The announcement by the DIC follows a move last month by Saudi billionaire Maan al-Sanea, who spent \u00a33bn on a 3% stake in the bank, which has been knocked by problems in its US arm. DIC refused to disclose the amount it had spent on its HSBC holding or to disclose the number of shares it bought other than to say it has become \"one of the leading shareholders in the company\". The group has not bought as much as a 3% stake - which would require disclosure to the stock exchange - and the size of the fund which acquired the HSBC shares is \u00a31bn, indicating that it would have needed to invest the entire fund if it were to take even a 1% stake in the bank. It is thought the DIC shareholding amounts to about 0.5%. HSBC's shares, which have been lower than 880p on its US woes, ended 3p down yesterday at 925p. DIC hopes that the global strategic equity fund will eventually grow to \u00a35bn. \"We are very excited about our pipeline of investment opportunities that are available in the global equities markets,\" said Sameer Al Ansari, executive chairman of DIC. The aim of the fund is to become a top shareholder in a number of global companies creating \"value through a portfolio of undervalued companies\". The DIC is better known for its investments in private equity rather than in listed public companies. It still owns 20% of the Tussauds group, which includes the London Eye, after selling a large part of the company to Legoland owner Merlin Entertainments. It also owns Travelodge, the budget hotel chain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
