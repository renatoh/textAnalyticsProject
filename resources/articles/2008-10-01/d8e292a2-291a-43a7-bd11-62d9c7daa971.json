Up to 1,000 extradition cases are expected to have been dealt with by the end of the year, more than double the number last year, and four times the number in 2006 according to figures from the City of Westminster magistrates court, which handles all extradition hearings. The increase is largely down to the volume of European arrest warrants (EAWs), many of them issued by Poland. EAWs, requiring the arrest and extradition of suspects from one EU country to another, are being used by Poland for a \"large volume of trivial extradition requests\", according to Detective Sergeant Gary Flood of Scotland Yard's extradition unit. He estimated that 40% of all extradition cases dealt with by the Metropolitan police originated in Poland, adding that many of the offences were so minor they would lead to either a caution or no investigation at all in England and Wales. In one case, according to Flood, a carpenter who fitted wardrobe doors and then removed them when the client refused to pay him, was subject to an extradition request by Poland so that they could try him for theft. In another case, the Polish authorities requested the extradition of a suspect for theft of a dessert. \"The European arrest warrant contained a list of the ingredients,\" Flood said. Although Poland is not the only culprit - a Lithuanian was extradited last year on a charge of \"piglet-rustling\" - it has made the most requests by far. According to Flood the volume of cases from Poland has forced the Metropolitan police to start chartering special planes to return suspects to Poland. \"We now arrange for a Polish military flight every three weeks,\" he said. The number of requests from Poland and other eastern European countries is due to the absence of a filtering process to weed out cases that are not worth prosecuting. The Crown Prosection Service (CPS), which manages prosecutions in England and Wales, operates a \"threshold test\" whereby cases are only pursued where it is \"in the public interest\". \"The Polish system requires a trial for every criminal allegation, no matter how trivial,\" said District Judge Nicholas Evans, one of only five extradition judges in England and Wales. Singling out Poland as a source of extradition requests, he said that the increase in cases was placing increasing strain on the system and \"a disproportionate amount of time is expended in cases which do not merit the effort\". Poland has already made 224 extradition requests this year, with Polish interpreters required and paid for by the court on 311 occasions. The EU has admitted in the past that the arrest warrants are being used \"disproportionately\" to the seriousness of offences. But the continuing rise in cases comes at a time when the courts, prosecution service and police are all under severe pressure because of a shortfall in resources. \"The CPS needs more lawyers and the court needs more time and more courtrooms,\" said Evans adding that it was \"doubtful\" the necessary resources would be made available due to a reported \u00a390m shortfall in the courts' budget. He also condemned the present arrangements for legal aid for defendants in extradition hearings, describing them as a \"disgrace\". The situation may be further aggravated by a recent decision of the Metropolitan police service management board to delegate responsibility for extraditions to police forces around the country. Scotland Yard's extradition squad, which currently oversees all extradition requests to European countries, will hand over the task to forces across the country, prompting concerns within the police forces and the legal community that the inexperience of forces outside London will add to the burden on the system. \"One quarter of arrests done by other forces at the moment are wrong and have to be corrected by Scotland Yard before they come to court,\" said Flood. \"Taking responsibility away from the Metropolitan police will have a major impact ... and will waste police time when they are supposed to be getting more police back on the streets\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
