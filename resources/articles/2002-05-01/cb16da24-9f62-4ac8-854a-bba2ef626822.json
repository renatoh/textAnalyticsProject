On the eve of the election to decide whether or not he would retain the presidency of football's world governing body, he told the Argentinian FA that it had no right to \"retire\" the No10 jersey worn by Diego Maradona during his 15-year career with the national team. Since permission had originally been granted by none other than Michel Zen-Ruffinen, who is one of the instigators of the movement to unseat Blatter, this must have been a particularly sweet moment for the president, coming only a few days before the fateful poll in Seoul. But that was not really the point. Nor was his decision any thing to do with Maradona being a dirty little cheat. Those who have recently found themselves watching the videos of the 1986 World Cup will have experienced the sensation of having their revulsion at the \"hand of God\" goal comprehensively overwhelmed by their admiration for the unearthly dynamism he injected into his team's play any time he took possession of the ball. There had been nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since. But that is not to say that there will be nothing like it in the future, and therein lies the argument on behalf of Blatter's decision. It is simply this: if a genuine heir to Maradona one day appears in Argentina, what a shame it would be if he were unable to don the shirt that Diego wore. The significance of shirt numbers is one of the most appealing strands of continuity across football's generations and eras. For example, the fact that David Beckham wears the No7 shirt that once graced the back of Stanley Matthews has a particular significance and value to England fans possessing a sense of historical perspective. Those who think Blatter was wrong generally put up two counter-arguments. First, in the United States it has long been the habit of clubs to retire the numbers of great players - Magic Johnson's 32 with the LA Lakers and Michael Jordan's 23 with the Chicago Bulls are two obvious examples. Second, the introduction of squad numbers in football has made the whole question irrelevant. The first can be dealt with simply. Numbers have no significance in basketball, beyond identifying individual players. They might just as well wear a number indicating the millions of dollars they earn a year. In football the number on a player's shirt indicates his position and his role. Or does it? The second argument points out that the arrival of the squad system has sometimes meant a player becoming ineradicably associated with a number not belonging to the sequence from 1-11. Roy Keane and the No16, for instance, will forever be linked in the minds of Manchester United fans. As a result, numbers are now taken more lightly, sometimes even whimsically. Denied the No9 shirt at Internazionale by the arrival of Ronaldo four years ago, the Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano whimsically requested the No18, with a small plus sign inserted between the two digits. Certain high-spending managers have been known to field teams bearing more resemblance, numerically, to a national lottery draw. The significance of individual numbers has evolved over the years, but we still have a very clear idea of what a No2 or a No9 is supposed to do. And what Blatter and the Argentinians were arguing about, of course, is football's sacred number - the number of Puskas, Pele and Platini, as well as of just about all my own favourite players, from Gianni Rivera to Zinedine Zidane. Zidane will be wearing the shirt at this tournament, of course, and we wish him a speedy recovery. Other influential 10s over the next month are likely to be Nigeria's Jay-Jay Okocha, Brazil's Rivaldo, Russia's Alexander Mostovoi, Turkey's Yildiray Basturk and Italy's Francesco Totti. First reports from the Argentina camp suggested that - in a squad containing Ariel Ortega, Marcelo Gallardo and Pablo Aimar, each of whom has the right to be considered a worthy heir to Maradona - the reinstated No10 shirt would be worn by their third-choice goalkeeper. But their administrators seem to have undergone a quick change of heart, and Ortega, the most senior of the trio, will now have the honour. And whether Blatter has done terrible things with Fifa's money or not, at least this decision was made in the interests of preserving football's soul. If I had a vote, he would get it for that alone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
