I\u2019ve always loved cars. I\u2019ve always loved travelling the world. Top Gear lets me do both, with the added bonus of annoying Paddy McGuinness along the way. During filming for the new series we visited Ethiopia, a staggeringly beautiful country that surprised us at every turn. We\u2019ve been to Iceland to compete in the most extreme off-road race series on the planet. And back in the spring we flew to Borneo to make a film with the Gurkhas, the British army\u2019s elite infantry unit. Basically, the Top Gear producers came up with the idea of ordering Paddy and me to buy rare cars \u2013 on a very small budget, obviously \u2013 before dropping us deep in the Bornean jungle. Our mission? To battle through torrential rain and mudslides and deliver our purchases to a mystery car collector to see if he would add them to his exotic collection. So far, so Top Gear. So, in March, we went and shot the film. And, after battling our way to the Gurkhas\u2019 unit base in the Brunei rainforest, we made it \u2013 with a lot of help from our team of superhuman soldiers \u2013 to the finishing line at the royal palace in Bandar Seri Begawan. Yes, the \u201cmystery car collector\u201d turned out to be the sultan of Brunei who, it\u2019s fair to say, wasn\u2019t expecting us. We certainly didn\u2019t get a warm welcome from his armed guards when we eventually parked up outside the palace gates. But we\u2019d completed our mission, in a Top Gear kind of a way, so thought it was job done. The Gurkhas were brilliant, and it was an honour to have worked with them. We flew home on 28 March. That date is important because when we landed we found out that \u2013 as we\u2019d been in the air \u2013 the sultan had announced the imposition of new laws making homosexuality and adultery punishable by stoning to death. We were horrified. Like millions of other people around the world, I utterly condemn Brunei\u2019s actions. No one deserves to be stoned to death, whoever they love. Love is love. We would never have filmed in Brunei had the law been implemented beforehand. Even though it has since been claimed that the laws will not be enforced, the threat still stands, and even the threat is an appalling abuse of human rights. In the past couple of months we have thought very hard about dropping the film entirely but we shot it before the change in the law, and both the Gurkhas and other Bruneians worked incredibly hard to make it happen. We don\u2019t want all their efforts to be for nothing. So we\u2019ve decided to go ahead and show it. Oh, and we\u2019ve given the cars a little makeover, as you can see. We hope you like what we\u2019ve done. \u2022 Andrew Flintoff is a Top Gear presenter and former England cricketer \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2019 to make clear that although death by stoning as punishment for gay sex and adultery was imposed this year, Brunei announced plans for the law in 2014"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
