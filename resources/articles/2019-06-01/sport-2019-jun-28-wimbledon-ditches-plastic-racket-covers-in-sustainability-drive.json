However, it will not be seen at this year\u2019s championships, which begin on Monday \u2013 or in future Wimbledon tournaments \u2013 after a review of the use of plastics, and sustainability in general, by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC). The removal of plastic bags from the player racket stringing operation means there will be 4,500 fewer plastic bags used at this year\u2019s championships, according to the club. Awareness of \u2013 and concern at \u2013 the effects of plastic waste on oceans is growing, and players and racket stringers alike have dismissed the idea the covers have any practical purpose. Kevin Anderson, the losing men\u2019s singles finalist last year, and the vice-president of the Association of Tennis Professionals player council, has voiced his desire to abolish them across the tour. Richard Lewis, the chief executive of the AELTC, said \u201cWe believe that Wimbledon, along with other major events, has a vital role to play in helping to protect the environment, today and for the future.\u201d There will be other changes at this year\u2019s tournament, including relating to plastic bottles, which were a talking point last year, with players including Johanna Konta and Kyle Edmund among those who expressed concern. While the AELTC is not going as far as Glastonbury, which has banned single-use plastic, or Oval cricket ground, which is looking to follow suit, it says the tournament sponsor Evian will launch its first 100% recycled and 100% recyclable water bottle at this year\u2019s championships. The club also says it has upped the percentage of recycled content in food and drink packaging, with cups for strawberries and cream made from 70% recycled plastic. No waste from last year\u2019s championships went to landfill, with non-recyclable waste used to produce electricity. But the AELTC wants to increase the proportion of waste entering recycling this year and to that end, it will have staff guiding the public to discard waste into appropriate bins, which will be more visible. The AELTC banned plastic straws last year and, in an attempt to reduce its environmental impact, signed up last month to the UN sports for climate action framework, which aims to encourage and assist sporting organisations to implement the Paris climate agreement. Unlike the plastic racket covers, the all-whites will not be disappearing from SW19 but they too are changing with the times, with some of the sport\u2019s biggest names wearing a specially designed environmentally friendly range of clothing this Wimbledon fortnight. Angelique Kerber, Caroline Wozniacki, Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, Alexander Zverev, Dominic Thiem and Stefanos Tsitsipas will all be wearing the Stella McCartney-designed Adidas kit. It is partially made from Parley ocean plastic, a material created from upcycled plastic waste intercepted from beaches and coastal communities before reaching the ocean, which is then converted to yarn. Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see major sports venues like Wimbledon increasingly taking steps to reduce their environmental footprint \u2013 but most still have some way to go. \u201cSports stadiums must put environmental sustainability at the heart of their operations and do what they can to minimise their impact on the planet. This should include timetabled targets for slashing climate-wrecking emissions and becoming single-use plastic free. \u201cThe UK holds numerous world-class sports events every year; the venues that host them should be aiming for excellence off the pitch, court and fairway \u2013 as well as on it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
