The two events are hardly comparable; for the first was just a tragic car accident like countless others, while the second was a monstrous and unprecedented act of terrorist aggression. Even so, in Britain the death of the \"people's princess\" caused a far greater outpouring of grief than the deaths of thousands amid the rubble of the Pentagon and the Twin Towers. At this distance in time, it seems extraordinary that people behaved in 1997 as if no greater tragedy could befall this country than the loss of an endearing but troubled young woman. The destruction of the Twin Towers, though far more tragic and terrible, and involving 78 British deaths, didn't move Britons to the same extent. Perhaps this was because Diana could not be even minimally blamed for her own death. It could, on the other hand, be argued that the United States, by its arrogance in the Middle East, brought September 11 upon itself - an unfair and heartless view, of course, but one that was very widely held. Now everything looks quite different. While few people think much about Diana any more, and many must be feeling embarrassed when they remember how extravagantly they responded to her death, we are all living with the consequences of September 11. The war in Afghanistan is over, but may turn out to have been just a prelude to more dangerous events. September 11 will remain a momentous episode in the history books, while the death of Diana will be lucky to survive as a footnote. It is therefore deeply regrettable that it has taken so long to choose her memorial in Hyde Park. The committee considering designs for a memorial fountain was evenly divided between two schemes until Tessa Jowell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), finally had to break the deadlock five years after the princess's death. And her choice wasn't even a fountain, but a ring of water - or what has been called a \"moat without a castle\". \"Di Fountain Is More Like A Drainage Ditch\" was the Sun's dismissive headline. Whatever the merits or demerits of the design by the American landscape artist Kathryn Gustafson (and it certainly doesn't look horrible), the words written in its praise by one of the memorial committee members - the Daily Telegraph's architecture critic, Giles Worsley - show why the committee should have struck while the iron was hot and made a decision long ago. \"At times, where the water rushes down the hill, the design suggests the princess's impulsive character,\" he wrote. \"Elsewhere, where the water slows down, her reflective side. With children splashing in the water, it will, above all, be joyous. It should be a very Diana-like memorial.\" Such words might have meant a lot to people a few years ago. Now they sound straight out of Private Eye's Pseuds' Corner. The chair of the Diana Memorial Committee, Rosa Monckton, realises how damaging the delay has been. In the London Evening Standard last week, she blamed the DCMS. \"When you see how a government department doesn't work, it is astonishing anything ever happens in this country.\" Perhaps the moat will turn out to be a \"joyous\" thing, as Mr Worsley expects. But the moment has been missed when the people of Britain really cared what kind of memorial Princess Diana had. Now they will probably just grumble about the cost. And what about the British victims of September 11? The government is currently talking to their families about the possibility of a memorial in London, on which a decision in principle is expected soon. It will be interesting to see - if the go-ahead is given - whether it will be erected before the completion of the Diana memorial, which is anticipated for 2004. It will be even more interesting to see whether New York manages to carry out the immeasurably greater and more controversial task of rebuilding the 16 acres of Ground Zero within seven years of September 11, which is the time it will have taken Britain to make its little moat in memory of the princess. Alas, I would not be at all surprised if it does."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
