The four-time major winner eventually found the solution for coping with the deep rough that has blossomed around the greens: a firm shot with a straight-faced sand-iron. The Briton could not be more confident. She has just had two weeks away from the tour since finishing second to Janice Moodie in Augusta. \"They have made the course incredibly hard this year, and if you miss the greens, then look out,\" said Davies. \"But it's one of my favourite tracks and I'm playing well enough to win.\" Scotland's challenge has never been stronger, with Moodie having backing from Catriona Matthew, Kathryn Marshall and Mhairi McKay but Annika Sorenstam, who has won five times this year, has been installed as favourite ahead of the defending champion, Australia's Karrie Webb."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
