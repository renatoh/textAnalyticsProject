On a visit to US Central Command headquarters, Pompeo said shipping security in the Gulf was not exclusively a US problem. \u201cYou have China that depends enormously on energy transiting the Strait of Hormuz. You have South Korea, Indonesia, Japan, all of whom have an enormous interest in ensuring there\u2019s freedom of navigation throughout this waterway,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cThe United States is prepared to do its part, but every nation that has a deep interest in protecting that shipping lane so that energy can move around the world and support their economies needs to make sure they understand the real threat.\u201d Pompeo added that \u201cPresident Trump does not want war, and we will continue to communicate that message, while doing the things that are necessary to protect American interests in the region.\u201d In an interview on Tuesday, Trump played down the threat to the US represented by the tanker attacks in the region, which he described as being \u201cvery minor\u201d. \u201cOther places get such vast amounts of oil there,\u201d Trump told Time magazine. \u201cWe get very little. We have made tremendous progress in the last two and a half years in energy. And when the pipelines get built, we\u2019re now an exporter of energy. So we\u2019re not in the position that we used to be in in the Middle East where \u2026 some people would say we were there for the oil.\u201d The Trump administration is seeking to handle the Gulf crisis amid turmoil in its top ranks. The acting defence secretary, Patrick Shanahan, who Trump had nominated to take on the job official, resigned on Tuesday \u201cto devote more time to his family\u201d, according to a Trump tweet. Trump named the army secretary, Mark Esper, to take over as acting defence secretary. The US has not had a Senate-confirmed defence secretary in place since December, when James Mattis resigned. As with his approach to Nato and US Pacific alliances, Trump is focused on persuading allies in the Gulf to shoulder a greater burden in providing security. The US would be able to rely on Gulf Arab support for tanker protection, but enlisting European involvement is complicated by the fact that European governments see the Trump administration as having precipitating the crisis by walking out of the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, and imposing an oil and banking embargo on the country. On Tuesday, Pompeo confirmed that the visit to Tehran last week by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was made on Trump\u2019s request. \u201cPresident Trump had sent \u2026 Abe to take a message of his to the leadership in Iran,\u201d the secretary of statem said. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, rejected the proposal of a dialogue with Trump and the two tankers, one of them Japanese-owned, were attacked while Abe was in Tehran. The deputy chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Paul Selva also confirmed on Tuesday that the US had been using Swiss and Iraqi channels as well as public messaging to warn Iran off any direct attack on US interests. \u201cTo engage [the US reinforcements] would be a miscalculation that would lead to a response,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to do that. We want them to be clear-eyed in whatever it is they are planning.\u201d He added: \u201cThe risks of miscalculation are real.\u201d Iran has denied responsibility for the blasts that hobbled two tankers in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday, but on Tuesday the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) \u2013 which the US says carried out the attack with limpet mines \u2013 stepped up the threat to ships travelling through the Strait of Hormuz. \u201cThese missiles can hit with great precision carriers in the sea,\u201d Brig Gen Hossein Salami said in a televised speech. \u201cThese missiles are domestically produced and are difficult to intercept and hit with other missiles.\u201d Anthony Cordesman, a national security analyst at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Arab states in the Gulf could easily help protect tankers with surveillance planes and drones, and could have warplanes at the site of an attack within minutes. Cordesman acknowledged that deep scepticism over US policy towards Iran has made European governments cautious about being drawn into a conflict, but he argued that the presence of a UK and French naval fleet could offer a powerful political deterrent to further attacks. \u201cIf what you want is a precondition for negotiations, and cool the situation down, there is an incentive for the UK and France to take part \u2013 if what you are doing is deterring attacks and monitoring the situation,\u201d Cordesman said. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state for political affairs, said: \u201cThe administration has a credibility problem due to its rash and unwise disavowal of the Iran nuclear deal and its threats to sanction European companies that do business with Iran.\u201d He added: \u201cBut Iran is clearly in the wrong in its activities in the Gulf. The administration is right to consider international convoys. And it is in the clear interest of the European allies, as well as some of the Sunni Arab states, to help the US. At risk is commercial energy traffic in a critical international waterway. Europe, especially, should want to see the free flow of oil and gas for its economic wellbeing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
