Alongside the country\u2019s rapid pace of development, the search for meaning and celebration of the Sacred are shaping China\u2019s future in new and significant ways. Fire ceremony gathering (2016) With more than 24 million residents, Shanghai is China\u2019s largest city and the 10th wealthiest in the world. It is famous for economic dynamism and architectural daring, and has become synonymous with consumerism. At the same time, it is at the forefront of religious resurgence. Rooted in history, this revival has swept in on the tide of globalisation, fed by the inventiveness of the Chinese people. Xu Guangqi Memorial Hall \u2013 A memorial for the Chinese scholar, statesman and Catholic convert Xu Guangqi (1562-1633) is located in a small park named after him After decades of suppression during the Mao era, the number of followers of China\u2019s five official religions \u2013 Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism \u2013 are steadily rising alongside a rich range of unofficial groups and alternative spiritual practices. It is a remarkable recovery, especially considering the destruction of religious infrastructure and knowledge, and continued political suppression. Noodles for Shanghai Shabbat (2016) Shanghai Sacred explores the spaces, rituals and communities \u2013 in official, unofficial, public and private forms \u2013 that together weave the spiritual fabric of the city.

Fang Sheng gathering, Changning district (2015) The traditional east Asian Buddhist practice of freeing captive animals to accrue good karma has flourished dramatically in recent years in Shanghai, in step with the rise of social media and online money donation, which keeps the practice afloat. Here hundreds of inhabitants gather to liberate $3,000 (\u00a32,400) worth of fish bought from the market that morning. Monks or devout lay people organise weekly devotional gatherings, performing the ritual throughout the public space, thus creating a new economy for fishermen and a sense of belonging in an ever-changing urban environment. Fang Sheng gathering, Shanghai Ferry Port (2015) Memorial Hall of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist party, Xintiandi area (2015) In 1921, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) was founded in Shanghai. This museum venerates the party and preserves the \u201cofficial\u201d memories of this occasion with a waxwork of Mao Zedong at the founding meeting. This space is part of the sacred geography of the city and a place that Chinese tourists visit in a reverent manner. The Longhua Revolutionary Martyrs\u2019 Memorial (2015) The Longhua Revolutionary Martyrs\u2019 cemetery commemorates the CCP members and other activists who died during the revolutionary struggles of 1928-37.

Thai Buddhist shrine, Super Brand mall, Pudong (2016) Super Brand Mall is one of the largest shopping centres in Asia. The Chia Tai Group, its Thai developer, set up a Buddhist shrine outside the entrance. A flow of passersby perform rituals at the shrine, which are believed to have improved the mall\u2019s business. Diwali festival (2013) Throughout history migrants and traders from afar have brought new ideas, language and lifestyles to Shanghai and integrated them with local customs to form distinct, syncretic cultures.

However, another option is available: a tower in the centre of the cemetery contains cabinets, which are sold as containers for ashes. Joss paper house, Shanghai Old City (2015) Elaborate items are made out of paper as offerings for the dead. They also reflect the values of the living. Among these offerings, the omnipresence of joss paper houses speaks of both the scarcity of housing that Shanghai experienced in the past and the rapid pace of urban transformation from the 1990s onwards. Migrant workers\u2019 church, Pudong (2016) On the coldest day in Shanghai for more than 40 years, migrant workers share a hot lunch offered by the Protestant church after the Sunday service held in a factory. The dedication to their faith and sense of community, as well as the promise of a hearty bowl of noodle soup, fuelled the congregation as they stood for two hours in -8C. The church, located in an old factory, was soon after moved to make way for the construction of Shanghai Disneyland.
