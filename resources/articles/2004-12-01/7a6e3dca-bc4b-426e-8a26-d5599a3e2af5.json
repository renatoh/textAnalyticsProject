Keith Senior and Ryan Bailey were each fined \u00a31,500, ordered to pay \u00a3700 costs, and severely reprimanded after a hearing on Wednesday, as the RFL's advisory panel accepted that the substance was contained in a cold cure which both had declared taking before their positive tests. One of them is understood to have tested positive late in the Super League season, and the other during the Tri-Nations series when most of the Great Britain squad suffered from a gastric virus. In explaining the apparent leniency of their punishment, the RFL pointed to the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines which classify ephedrine as a \"specified substance\" that is \"particularly susceptible to unintentional anti-doping violations\" - and therefore should not necessarily carry a ban. In athletics, for example, a positive test for ephedrine carries a warning rather than a ban, although the athletes' results are also annulled. That would not be practical in a team sport, and the doping regulations for the Tri-Nations series had already been clouded by Australia's refusal to include ephedrine on their list of banned substances. Senior was an ever-present in the Tri-Nations campaign while Bailey played in four of their five matches as a substitute. Stephen Rutherford, a young Gateshead Thunder forward, used the same defence after he tested positive for ephedrine late in the National League Two season, and he too escaped with a reprimand, and a contribution to the costs of his hearing. The RFL's executive chairman Richard Lewis admitted that the three cases had highlighted the need to increase players' awareness of what they can and cannot take. \"These cases do not represent a widespread problem in rugby league, but we do feel it is important to clarify issues relating to ephedrine so that all players and relevant personnel have the maximum amount of information to guide them in this important area,\" he said. \"There are clear lessons to be learned for all,\" agreed the Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington. \"We will support any new education and information initiatives which the RFL seek to introduce.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
