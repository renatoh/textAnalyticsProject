'It's not really working together,' he says as a man in his twenties sprints past us, his arms chopping the air at his sides, his face fixed in a grimace of determination. 'He's trying too hard - that's quite a manufactured style.' Thankfully, this is not the Olympic trials. We are standing in the grand, neo-classical hall that normally houses the sculpture galleries at Tate Britain, where every 30 seconds another runner hares along the cool floor as part of Martin Creed's new installation, Work No 850. Their run-for-your-life appearances will continue day in, day out for the next four months (don't worry - they're in shifts). Edwards is loving it. He has already picked his favourite: a tall chap with jet-black ponytail who seems to glide along on the balls of his feet. 'It's smooth, it's graceful, and there's a nice coordination to his running,' says Edwards. 'It's probably the most aesthetically pleasing because it's the most harmonious.' Art criticism, it turns out, is not as hard as it looks. While Edwards wouldn't describe himself as an aficionado, he has a lively interest in art - he buys the odd piece for his London flat, which is just around the corner from Tate Britain, and last visited the gallery to see Mark Wallinger's State Britain ('very disturbing'). He is, moreover, already a fan of Creed's work. 'He did the light switching on and off, didn't he?' he says of Creed's Turner Prize winner, Work No 227. 'I liked that, because we live in a time when you expect everything immediately but the pace was dictated to you and you could only take in so much at a time.' He pauses. 'I didn't go and see it, I just liked the idea of it.' That's conceptual art for you. A short, stocky man in light blue gym kit jinks past a party of schoolchildren who are keen to see what happens when they stand in his way. 'Rugby player,' says Edwards. The runners are in relays of four, so we see him again a minute and a half later. 'It's like life,' says Edwards, cheerfully. 'You're just going round in a circle: it's entirely pointless, but it's energising and vibrant at the same time.' The artist himself is wandering the halls - there are various things he has to do to 'maintain' the work, including telling his athletes to run faster (slacking is emphatically not allowed). At the moment, Creed tells us, he is desperate for new recruits - finding the right runners for the task is not easy. 'They need to be able to sprint fast and to be able to keep it up,' he says (each one has to undergo a heart test before they are taken on). 'The best ones keep their speed up throughout the half-hour.' Like Nathan, our rugby player, who is Creed's favourite. 'Super fast,' he says. 'He's the star in my mind.' I ask Edwards whether the runners - volunteers from athletics clubs who are being paid \u00a310 an hour - are getting a beneficial workout. 'It's quite like interval training,' he says, 'when you run the straights and walk the bends, to get your heart rate up.' Creed says he's in training himself, because he'd like to be involved in the work, although his dodgy back may prove an obstacle. Edwards, who is on the London 2012 Games Organising Committee, has his own suggestion - why not get in some Olympians to do the sprints, perhaps as part of the handover ceremony when the Beijing Games finishes at the end of August? Creed goggles at the idea of Daley Thompson hurtling down the gallery. 'Aye, that would be great!' Edwards takes down his details. 'Sometimes sport is set against culture and art,' he says, 'particularly at the moment, when the arts community feels its funding is being taken away to support the 2012 Games. So to bring them together is brilliant.' But on to the more important question: what does it all mean? For Creed, running is the ultimate sign of life - because it's the absolute opposite of stillness. Edwards recalls some research he once did into the ancient Olympics: 'They were all about Zeus, so I asked, why did they have sport and religion tied together? I discovered that prior to the Olympics they had fertility races: running was a sign of vitality and life. You relied on the gods to give you the rain and the sun in season, to give you crops, to grant you successful hunting. And the expression of life through a race was a metaphor of life.' Creed looks at him appreciatively. In August, when he announces - as he surely will - that Sir Steve, Dame Kelly and Lord Coe have been coopted into his art project, you'll know who was behind it. It could run and run...: Laura Cumming on work no. 850 Turner Prize winner Martin Creed has relays of runners sprinting the length of the Duveen Galleries every minute or so, a spectator sport to admire without too much solemnity. Fast, graceful, it is an ordinary and yet surprising sight, each athlete performing with such different stride and sensibility. Sprinters appear and disappear mysteriously between the classical columns. At the start, they are moving sculptures; at the end, they turn, momentarily, into painted figures against the far wall. Work No 850 has its farcical side, of course: the same few athletes coming round again and again, like the charioteers in Ben-Hur, but it accomplishes its aim very well. Time, place, the human figure - art's preoccupations are brought fleetingly into living focus, and it does encourage a more spirited speed in the viewer. It's a thought, or a few thoughts, lightly put over and, like all of Creed's work, surprisingly unobtrusive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
