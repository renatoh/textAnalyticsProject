The first fires have been lit, the first food \u2013 bread made from flour ground beside the hearth on a stone quern \u2013 cooked, and slightly to the surprise of their landlords, the first residents, some house martins, have moved in. From Monday visitors are welcome to duck their heads under the low lintels and come in. English Heritage has based the four oval houses and a small store room on the foundations of real houses built 4,500 years ago at the nearby settlement of Durrington Walls, where archaeologists believe the people who built the most famous prehistoric monument in the world gathered for seasonal rituals and feasting. The height of the walls and the size of the roof could be estimated from the size of the foundations, but the roof structure remains guesswork \u2013 different techniques of thatch have been used on each house. They were built over the winter beside the new Stonehenge visitor centre \u2013 and as an exercise in experimental archaeology, have already established that building in wattle and daub and thatch, over one of the wettest winters ever recorded, is a painful process. Twenty tonnes of chalk, 5,000 hazel rods, and three tonnes of wheat straw have gone into the houses, but the ground is still so waterlogged that some of the chalk floors laid weeks ago, which should be bone dry by now, are still as sticky as chewing gum. The materials were authentic, but in order to get the houses finished for this season, the tools were not \u2013 cement mixers were used to mix the daub, wheelbarrows to carry the timber, and the baskets of logs by the hearths have been split with steel rather than stone axes. The houses should have opened to the public weeks ago, but the work was going so slowly that after Christmas extra builders were conscripted. Bob Mitchell, a retired engineer who worked at Reuters and several other media organisations in the glory days of the old Fleet Street, and had volunteered with his partner to help in the visitor centre, joined a team including several teachers, a tour guide and a lawyer, spending happy days covered from head to toe in a gloopy mixture of powdered chalk, chopped straw and water. \"Jolly hard work, particularly on the really cold wet days,\" he recalled, \"but it's quite something now they're finished.\" Inside the final coat of daub was applied with rags, giving a smooth almost polished effect, and the result is surprisingly elegant. Furnished with timber and wicker beds and shelves, clay pots and jars, and a central hearth, the houses are surprisingly spacious and bright with light filtering through the thatch reflecting off the white walls. The bread, Mitchell said, though not as good as the sourdough he makes himself, was \"pretty tasty\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
