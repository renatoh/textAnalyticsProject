The tourists are in for a long wait: road workers hope to clear the southbound highway, leading to Haast, by Friday, transport officials said. But slips on the road north - towards the town of Hokitika - could take until January to clear. The town of a few hundred people does not have a major airport. But about 40 tourists had paid for private helicopter or ski-plane flights out of the town on Monday morning, said Adam Joyce, the chief executive of Inflite, the company that owns the local planes, which are usually used by its skydiving operation. \u201cThere\u2019s more than we can keep up with at the moment,\u201d Joyce said of the demand to leave the town. Not every tourist was able to leave \u2013 tickets cost $599, and some had vehicles, such as campervans, that they could not abandon. But those who did, Joyce said, would be flown to the village of Mount Cook with buses provided to the tourist hub of Queenstown. Tourists\u2019 woes did not end there; because of other road closures in the South Island due to flooding, some who got out would still struggle to return to the cities where their international flights were due to depart from. MacWatt said her boyfriend was considering parking his car \u2013 which he owned \u2013 in the town until he could come back and get it \u201cin about a month\u201d if the pair was able to leave, and they were waiting to hear more from officials on Monday afternoon. They could not afford commercial helicopter tickets out of the town, she said, and planned to ask whether the government\u2019s civil defence agency could evacuate them. After sleeping in the car for two nights as thunderstorms raged around them, the pair had \u201cupgraded\u201d to a hostel on Sunday night, MacWatt said, and had made friends with others in the same predicament. \u201cEveryone\u2019s just been playing card games and going for walks,\u201d said MacWatt, adding that there were beautiful trails nearby. \u201cBut we\u2019ve done them all now. There\u2019s nothing else to do.\u201d The pair had basic backpackers\u2019 insurance and could not afford more costly attractions in the area while they waited. At the local store, the Franz Josef Four Square, Raj Kumar was expecting a delivery of food in the coming days. For now, the shop was out of bread and fresh milk, as well as pasta and meat, but still had \u201cplenty\u201d of chocolate for sale. \u201cEveryone\u2019s had the same idea,\u201d said MacWatt, of the shortage of dinner ingredients. On a month-long trip to New Zealand, she did not relish the prospect of spending several more days in the same small town. \u201cIt\u2019s quite sad and quiet, everyone\u2019s very down,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same boat, we\u2019re missing international flights and excursions that we\u2019ve paid for.\u201d For local businesses, too, there were questions about the town\u2019s infrastructure. Franz Josef has just a few hundred residents but plays host to half a million tourists a year. It is earthquake and flood-prone, and the town is cut off \u201cabout every second year\u201d by road, usually in autumn or winter, said Kumar, from the local store. Joyce, from the plane charter company, said the damage already done to the town\u2019s tourism season - December heralds the beginning of summer in New Zealand - was \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d \u201cThe infrastructure is poor to say the least, money needs to be spent or this is going to happen again,\u201d he said, adding that the company would much rather be running its usual scenic trips than evacuating stranded tourists. For those on the ground in Franz Joseph, more immediate matters occupied their thoughts: MacWatt said it was her boyfriend\u2019s birthday, and their plans for a night in Queenstown would be replaced by another walk, some pizza, and a trip to the local bar. \u201cThere\u2019s not even a liquor store in this town so we can\u2019t even get a nice drink,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to be a beer.\u201d Elsewhere in New Zealand, evacuations were ordered in Timaru district, between Christchurch and Dunedin, where flooding was endangering houses and had cut off state highway 1. A number of South Island weather stations recorded more than 250mm of rain on Saturday alone, including in Queenstown and Wanaka. Milford Sound recorded 608mm in December\u2019s first week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
