The animal health minister, Ben Bradshaw, said confirmation that the disease had spread to more EU countries meant it was now more likely to reach Britain. But he said an outbreak was not inevitable and he insisted the government was not closing the countryside in the face of the threat. Mr Bradshaw was speaking as European bird flu experts backed European Commission calls for extra \"buffer zones\" around infection regions. The current 3km quarantine and 10km surveillance zones will be encircled by the buffer zone, the size of which will be determined by national authorities, in an attempt to cut the risk of the disease spreading. The EU standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreed to consider a French request for a poultry vaccination programme to counter the further spread of avian flu. Greece, Italy, Slovenia and Germany have confirmed H5N1 outbreaks, but test results are still awaited on H5 virus samples sent by Austria and Hungary to the EU's laboratory in Weybridge, Surrey. All the outbreaks discovered in the EU so far have involved wild birds - believed to be migratory swans carrying the flu virus. Measures to isolate the areas where infected wild birds are found are already in place. But concern is growing about the difficulty of controlling the spread of H5N1 if and when \"domestic\" birds - mainly commercial poultry on farms - catch the virus. The British government has drawn up plans to set up one-mile exclusion zones if any wild bird is found to be infected with H5N1. Inside the zone all poultry movements would be halted. If any poultry was found to be infected the entire flock would face being culled. \"The movements that would be affected would be those of poultry, not of human beings,\" he told the BBC. \"Some of the rather alarmist headlines that have been around today about the countryside closing and footpaths closing are simply wrong.\" Mr Bradshaw said the government had such powers but did not intend to use them. \"This is not anything like foot-and-mouth as a disease,\" he said. \"It spreads through bird faeces; it is not nearly as easy to spread as foot-and-mouth, which is spread on the air; and it is not nearly as virulent.\" Mr Bradshaw also said the government was not asking people to keep poultry indoors, as is being done in some countries. He said the government would take such action if there was an outbreak in Britain. Mr Bradshaw said confirmation that the disease had reached more EU countries did not mean it was \"inevitable\" it would get to Britain. \"It is more likely now than it was, but it is not inevitable,\" he said. \"It's still only in wild birds; it hasn't been found in any poultry so far in EU countries this time. But clearly the closer it gets to us the risk grows. But the risk, according to vets, is still low.\" Meanwhile an expert warned that the weather in continental Europe over the next few weeks will affect the chances of migratory birds bringing the H5N1 virus into Britain. The mute swans found dead in Germany would not have posed any direct threat to Britain as they do not migrate to this country. However, there is a risk that ducks and geese could come into contact with an infected bird in frozen central Europe before heading to Britain in search of food and water. Dr Andre Farrar, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said if the continental winter eases, then birds will not need to fly west. If it continues, they could head to Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
