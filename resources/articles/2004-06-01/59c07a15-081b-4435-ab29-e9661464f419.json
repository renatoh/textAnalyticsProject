Williams could not cope with the Croatian's searing shot-making but the defeat owed as much to Williams' errors at it did to Sprem's impressive display. Williams has been in the last four Wimbledon finals, winning the title in 2000 and 2001 and losing to her sister Serena in 2002 and 2003, but there were times when she looked a grass-court novice against Sprem, who has played Wimbledon only once before and won only one match. Williams was sidelined between Wimbledon last year and January, and this latest setback comes after her third-round defeat to Lisa Raymond at the Australian Open and that in the quarter-final to Anastasia Myskina in the French Open. The loss of momentum caused by her injury break may yet become permanent. The days when she was invincible to everyone but her sister are long gone and she can no longer expect to win matches without playing well, certainly not against opponents of Sprem's quality. Williams looked the part in her newly designed white dress, which had a deliberately uneven hemline, cut to look ragged. The same might be said for her game and Sprem was fearless in exploiting the opportunities presented time and again by Williams's mistakes. Sprem came close to beating Williams in the semi-finals in Berlin in May before choking and, when the chance came at 5-3 in the second set to atone, this time in front of an enthralled Centre Court crowd, she wobbled again, then again in the tie-break, when she went 6-3 down. Finally she was helped by a double fault by Williams as well as a wild forehand when match-point came. There was controversy late in the match when, at 1-2 in the second-set tie-break, the umpire Ted Watts mistakenly awarded a point to Sprem when she should have been given just a second serve. Watts called the score at 2-2 and, when neither player complained, the match carried on, despite the fact that Sprem continued to serve from the same side, as though she was hitting a second serve after all. It had little impact on the outcome of the match, save to give it a dramatic and rather bemusing conclusion. Nobody tell Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo but there are those who consider her to be favourite this year. For the most part she looked assured and comfortable on the grass during her 6-2, 6-3 win over Croatia's Jelena Kostanic but it might be better for her chances if nobody, particularly Mauresmo, reads too much into the swagger she has on court. In a draw depleted by the absence through illness and injury of Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters, and thrown open further by the unpredictable form of the Williams sisters, one of the few people who can stop Mauresmo winning is the woman herself. There was ample illustration of her gifts against Kostanic but the problem, historically, has been in her brain and not her brawn. Her mental fragility has manifested itself most starkly across the Channel, on the occasions when the merciless expectation of the French crowd and her own desire have appeared to root her feet to the clay courts of Roland Garros and ruined her chances of winning there. The odd French-accented cry rang around a half-empty Centre Court yesterday, urging her on with an \" allez Am\u00e9lie \" or two, but otherwise she was allowed to go about her business free from pressure. There were one or two gentle wobbles against Kostanic but no one watching seemed to mind too much and there was certainly no booing or gasps when occasionally she misfired. Mauresmo's relaxed state of mind was helped enormously by Kostanic, who seemed flummoxed by the grass and the strange things it did to the ball. She occasionally tried to slice but, when she did so, she had the touch and poise of someone playing in oven mitts and could do nothing much to stop Mauresmo's relentless aggression. The Frenchwoman took 16 minutes to wrap up the first set and, despite having a thigh heavily strapped, sped through the second almost as easily. Mary Pierce, though never quite as French as she would have her public believe - she was born in Canada of Franco-American descent - managed to satisfy her home crowd by winning the French Open in 2000 but has done next to nothing since. Yesterday she went out 6-2, 7-5 to Virginia Ruano Pascual in a blaze of errors, punctuated by heavy sighs. The 29-year-old was not helped by a thumb injury that necessitated treatment when she was 4-1 down in the first set but such aches and pains are nothing compared with the advances of age and waistline which seem to have permanently diminished her powers. By contrast the 28-year-old Jennifer Capriati is looking in ambitious and assured form and, like Mauresmo, must be quietly eyeing the trophy while outwardly playing down her chances. Yesterday she beat Claudine Schaul 6-2, 6-2 in a match held over from Tuesday and she will be a daunting opponent today for Britain's Elena Baltacha. \"I think it's amazing that I'm still here and still playing and even in the running to win it, so I should be motivated for that,\" she said. Capriati is taking advice from Tom Gullikson here and, though no one seems sure how permanent the arrangement is with the former US Davis Cup captain and former coach to Pete Sampras, he seems to have already imbued her with a more aggressive game plan. She was frequently at the net, harrying Schaul, a habit that should stand her in good stead here if she keeps it up. Like Mauresmo, she will be keen not to cast her mind forward to the possibility of winning the title, however well she is playing. Her mantra appears to be taking things one step at a time, in all things. After her match she was asked whether she would consider having a family after she retires. \"That's a long way down the road,\" she said, with a giggle. \"I'd have to get a boyfriend first.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
