An inquiry by the House of Commons' public affairs committee (PAC) into the private incomes of the Queen and Prince Charles found a series of \"anomalies\" and \"conflicts of interests\", said Chapman, notably in the fact that Prince Charles has no obligation to protect the finances of the Duchy of Cornwall, his main source of private income, for future generations. Last year, the prince drew \u00a313.3m from the duchy, \"more than four times the sum he received in 1993. MPs are also asking why the duchy pays no capital gains tax ... [or] corporation tax.\" Elsewhere in the Mail, Geoffrey Levy poured scorn on the prince's \"commercialism\". The duchy has risen in value from \u00a3110m in 1996 to \u00a3505m today, he said, and these \"hard-nosed profits\" have \"soared to keep pace with [the prince's] expanding lifestyle\", which includes \"the rising cost of Camilla\". The prince's \"consistently frivolous expenditure\" was the first cause for concern, said Harry Reid in the Glasgow Herald. The second scandal, he reckoned, was that \"what is by any standards a big business ... is not subject to normal business taxes\". The London Evening Standard agreed. While \"the estates have been run remarkably efficiently\", it said, \"if the finances of the duchy are conducted like those of a hard-headed business, it will have to justify its exemption.\" Quite so, said the Independent. Though the \"commercial success\" of the Duchy Originals brand of organic foods is \"laudable\", this is precisely why these \"preferential tax breaks ... must end forthwith\". Hang on, said the Times, Prince Charles \"could easily have been a playboy royal\", but \"he has devoted himself to charities and good causes.\" The paper thought the PAC \"was right to question the \u00a313.3m that the prince paid himself last year, if only to prompt the clarification ... that 70% of the total was spent on tax and the funding of official and charitable duties.\" The nation \"should be grateful that the future king has a business brain, a concern for the underprivileged, a dedication to charity and a seeming allergy to idleness\", it concluded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
