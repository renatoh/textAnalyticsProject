The chief inspector of prisons says that as many as 29,400 people who are remanded to prison to await their verdict or sentence each year are released immediately after their trials because they have been acquitted or not given a custodial sentence. There are between 12,000 to 13,000 remand prisoners held at any one time. They spend an average of nine weeks inside and represent 15% of the prison population, with women and those from minority ethnic backgrounds over-represented. The chief inspector, Nick Hardwick, says that despite a long-established principle that remand prisoners should have rights and entitlements not available to sentenced prisoners, many in fact endure a poorer prison regime, with less access to support services and less preparation for their release. The prisons inspectorate's thematic report on remand prisoners published on Thursday says that it is now the \"norm\" under prison service policy for remand prisoners to share a cell with a sentenced prisoner despite it being expressly forbidden that they be required to share under prison rules. Few of the remand prisoners interviewed by inspectors could recall being asked for their consent. The report based on findings of surveys and inspections at 33 local prisons, fieldwork at a further five jails and focus groups of remand prisoners, says that they are at an increased risk of suicide and self-harm with nearly a quarter saying they felt depressed or suicidal when they arrived at prison. The remand prisoners told the inspectors that few staff were able to distinguish between remand and sentenced prisoners on the wings and had limited or no knowledge of their entitlements. \"The right to vote had not been facilitated at two of the five prisons visited. Remand prisoners were allowed to wear their own clothes at most establishments, but this was often hindered by complicated and prohibitive processes,\" says the report. It also discloses the scale of legal problems facing remand prisoners with nearly half reporting difficulty in getting information about applying for bail. Many reported difficulties in maintaining contact with solicitors because they could not get access to a phone or afford the calls. The fact that remand prisoners make up a transient population temporarily held mainly in large, old, inner city jails makes it hard for prison governors to provide much in the way of purposeful regime. More than half the unconvicted prisoners reported spending less than four hours a day out of their cells on weekdays although all had the right to choose to attend work or education classes. \"Most in our groups said they wanted to take part in activity as this increased their time out of cell and ability to earn money, but a lack of places and/or the prioritisation of sentenced prisoners meant some were unable to do so.\" The chief inspector said the specific circumstances of remand prisoners needed to be recognised: \"This is not just a question of addressing injustice in the treatment of individuals, but ensuring that costly prison places are not used unnecessarily and that everyone is given the chance to leave prison less likely to commit offences than when they arrived.\" Michael Spurr, the chief executive officer of the national offender management service, said the report raised important issues that were being addressed: \"Our existing policies recognise the distinction between remand and sentenced prisoners and set out the privileges and entitlements that reflect remand prisoners' status. We have already taken action to reinforce requirements on cell sharing and access to work for remand prisoners. \"We will continue to reinforce the management of remand prisoners, to ensure we are meeting the statutory requirements and the findings from this report will further inform this work in due course.\" Spurr added that a \"no real prospect\" test was being introduced aimed at reducing the number of those who were unnecessarily remanded into custody who subsequently did not receive a jail sentence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
