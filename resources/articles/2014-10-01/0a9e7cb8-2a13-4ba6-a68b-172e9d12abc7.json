Although Van Gaal said that it was \u201ctwo points lost\u201d at Albion and lamented the poor goals that his side conceded, the Dutchman maintained that United could overhaul Chelsea, who visit Old Trafford on Sunday. Asked whether it was possible to catch Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team, Van Gaal replied: \u201cThat\u2019s possible but it is difficult to say because I am then arrogant. But I have done it a lot of times.\u201d United had looked like they would be leaving empty-handed when Saido Berahino scored his seventh goal of the season to enhance his case for a full England call-up next month. But Blind\u2019s superbly taken goal, on an evening when Marouane Fellaini finally opened his account for United, earned Van Gaal\u2019s side a point that leaves them in sixth place. \u201cTwo points lost \u2013 I think we were the better team,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cI am very disappointed about the result. You can say we were two times behind but I don\u2019t think that West Bromwich Albion has created many chances \u2013 I think zero. \u201cAnd we gave the two goals away. I think we dominated the game \u2013 that\u2019s what I want as a coach, as a manager \u2013 but the manager doesn\u2019t want a result like 2-2. I said that to my players, I cannot be happy.\u201d Van Gaal refused to accept that he needs to sacrifice some attacking flair to make the team more solid. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is the solution,\u201d he said. \u201cI have already explained that a lot of times. It was two errors [against Albion]. And also in the past, because I think we could have eight points more and then we are up [the table].\u201d With Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal to come in three of the next four fixtures, Van Gaal acknowledged that United need to improve. \u201cNow we have to play against Chelsea. In the Netherlands they say that is another cookie, another biscuit. It is another level and we have to see if we can beat them.\u201d For Albion, who had gone ahead through St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon\u2019s brilliant goal in the eighth minute, this was another promising performance under Alan Irvine and underlined how far Berahino has come since last season. Irvine, the Albion head coach, predicted an England cap may not be far away for the 21-year-old striker. \u201cHe\u2019s in great form just now. He deserves what he is getting as a reward. With the potential that he\u2019s got, he\u2019s got a great future ahead of him. I\u2019ve just said to Saido: \u2018Keep on doing the right things.\u2019 People will eventually make those decisions and I think if he keeps on performing like that he has got a real chance of being a senior international at some point.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
