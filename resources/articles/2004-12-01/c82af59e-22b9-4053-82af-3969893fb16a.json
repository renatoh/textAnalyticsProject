The 75ft trimaran crossed into the eastern hemisphere yesterday, having covered more than a quarter of the 26,000-mile course around the world. MacArthur consistently maintained 19-20 knots during a 24-hour run in which she logged 481.6 miles. A north-westerly breeze continued to build as a low-pressure weather system caught up with B&amp;Q, producing 35-knot gusts which forced the English woman to reduce sail. \"We're getting our arses blown off,\" she said. \"Sailing at 120 [degrees] and side seas. Got third reef in; getting it out is a nightmare, and think it might be a mistake. Boat slowed right down; we were going really well. But don't want to end up going too far south.\" She is still 240 miles south of the track of Francis Joyon. \"We're trying to make a course of due east rather than dropping into the south because at the moment the breeze is basically from the north-west, which makes it very difficult for us to climb to the north. But that breeze is going to drop back into the west and then we're going to gybe over and head south-east.\" A cold front is expected to pass through today and the breeze should turn to the south-west tonight. That will initiate a series of gybes over the next few days as MacArthur manoeuvres B&amp;Q in front of the depression, ensuring she doesn't go too far south, where the stronger breeze and bigger waves might be detrimental to the boat's performance. \"Things are getting a little bit chilly,\" she said. \"We're in our first Southern Ocean depression. We're actually at 38 south so I'm almost officially in the Southern Ocean. We're heading down there for a long time so mentally things are changing and physically things are obviously changing too as it gets colder.\" MacArthur wants to cross the longitude of the Cape of Good Hope before 04:41GMT on Saturday to beat Joyon's time of 19 days 20hr 31min. \"We should be able to keep up a pretty reasonable speed between now and the Cape of Good Hope, which is a good indication that we may be able to pass underneath the cape ahead of Francis's time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
