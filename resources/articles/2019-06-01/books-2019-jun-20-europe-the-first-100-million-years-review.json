He vividly describes how the European landmass was created and shaped, and how its flora and fauna evolved. Europe is \u201cwhere the investigation of the deep past began\u201d, and this book is also about the science that has brought ancient history alive. Flannery begins when the European \u201czoogeographic region\u201d first emerged 100m years ago, with \u201cgroves of palms and ferns overtopped by ginkgos\u201d. Salamanders and newts date from this time, as do midwife toads, \u201cliving fossils\u201d that are reminders of Europe\u2019s dawn. The climate crisis and globalisation raise new challenges: almost every European tree is threatened by an Asiatic disease or parasite. Industrial farming has also reduced the bird population by 421 million in just three decades. But Flannery\u2019s superb study shows that Europe is a land of \u201cexceptional dynamism\u201d and resilience \u2013 amazingly, there are now more wolves here than in the US. New species are constantly arriving and adapting, helping to \u201cmake Europe anew\u201d. \u2022 Europe: The First 100 Million Years is published by Penguin (\u00a310.99).
