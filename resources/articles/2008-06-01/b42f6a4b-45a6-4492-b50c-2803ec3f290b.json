What's less known is that there wasn't originally a trilogy to make. It only became a trilogy after a piece of political sleight-of-hand that changed the name of the first film from Jamie, in order to ensure that Bill continued to make films. In the summer of 1971 I was asked to hold the fort as head of production at the British Film Institute, while it found a replacement for Bruce Beresford. It was only meant to last a few months - I had trained as an editor, and had directed and written screenplays, but I had not run a department and I was wary of producers. I did not relish the role. Since then, I have done quite a bit of administering and producing, and I blame Bill. When I began my stint, Bruce had left two piles of applications for the scant money the BFI had to support film-making, all of which went to short films. There was a tall pile of rejections, and a smaller one of maybes. Bill Douglas's script, with the title \"Jamie\", was in the smaller pile. It took 10 pages of reading for it to go from being a maybe to a must. Bill's screenplay was different from any I had read. One could see the film immediately. He eschewed the convention of scene headings (ext/int, location, day/night); there was no generalised description and no emotional padding. It was lucid and concretely imagined. It unfolded in a series of descriptions, some deliberately ungrammatical, that without the use of technical terms evoked the shot, size of frame, and who and what was in it. Dialogue was spare. It was almost a silent movie. It was also a fine piece of writing - poetic even. The script was the film. Or so I thought. We awarded him \u00a33,000 (out of the \u00a35,000 that we had). Bill's fee was \u00a3150. I gave him the best crew that lack of money can buy: raw talent with passion and verve. At first everything went well. Bill was affable, intelligent and good company. Once shooting started, it all changed. He was a man apart. Banter and joking - normal during a shoot- irked him. Maybe the story was too close to him. He said he was resurrecting old memories, but it was more than that. He was setting the record straight, grieving, settling scores, forgiving and much else. His vision came at a price. Before Bill started shooting, I told him he would make an important film. But even I was startled by the first set of rushes. They were intense, stark and distilled to utter simplicity. The images were individual and distinct, but with hints of Soviet cinema, Bresson and early neo-realism. His storytelling was also particular. If classical narrative is like light in Newtonian physics, in that it travels in a straight unbroken line, then Bill's narrative is akin to quantum physics, where light moves in discrete packages of energy. Never show the audience something, he said, that it can imagine better than you can show it. In Bill's work, the gaps would make another film. The audience has to work to fill the gaps; it has to participate. It is exhilarating. This was not British cinema. It was something else. It was alien. That unique quality raised a problem: I could not see our industry backing him. Politics, these days, is extra-curricular to film-making; in the 70s it was the only subject. Narrative cinema was considered old-fashioned and in pursuit of a new, non-bourgeois cinema, the BFI Action Committee was trying either to take over the Institute or dismember it. The committee favoured collective film-making with no hierachies. Applicants for funding, I learned, should spend half a day discussing the economic, social, political and aesthetic aspects of their project. Presumably they got to spend the other half talking about what the film itself would be about. It was not going to be easy to get Bill funding for a second film in this climate. So I came up with a wheeze. Jamie was clearly about Bill's childhood, so I pretended that Bill had always intended to make a \"childhood\" trilogy - with its echoes of Mark Donskoi's Gorki films and Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy. We were not, I said, backing three films, but one film in three parts. Bill went along with this. Jamie became My Childhood and the trilogy was born. In competition with star-filled films that cost millions, My Childhood won the Silver Lion at Venice in 1972 . Its success helped the BFI to move into feature production. It represented, I argued, the beginnings of an alternative cinema in Britain. Denis Forman, then chairman of the BFI, pointed out to the government that the BFI was doing what the National Film Finance Corporation, the quango responsible for film funding, was not interested in. Minister for the Arts Lord Eccles was persuaded. The BFI went into features and the budget was increased twentyfold. I stayed another two years and we backed, among others, My Ain Folk, Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's Winstanley, Peter Smith's A Private Enterprise, David Gladwell's Requiem for a Village and Horace Ove's Pressure. It would be wrong to say Bill was difficult. I know directors with a tenth of his talent who are more egotistical. He was not a prima donna. He was, however, exacting - at times beyond reason. He would \"remember\" a scene, imagine it anew, write it down and then want it exactly like that. I believe he was persecuted by those images that had the power and hold of dreams. If he couldn't get it to work, it hurt him. Bill made people work for him through pain. His pain became the crew's pain. Peter Harvey, who was sound recordist on My Ain Folk and now a well-known cinematographer, said of him: \"I could flatten him with one punch, but he terrified the life out of me.\" What was terrifying was how much it mattered to Bill. In return, the crew gave him more than their best - they over-achieved. Still, we had our dramas. Just after midnight on the first day of filming My Ain Folk, Peter rang to tell me that Bill had finished only one set-up; the producer had left the picture; and Bill was having a nervous breakdown. I arrived in Newcraighall just outside Edinburgh late the following morning. I wanted to hear from Bill himself, and nobody else, what had gone wrong. Ashen-faced, he sat down and pointed at Peter. \"I want Mr Harvey to pay for my typewriter. He made me throw it at the bedroom wall.\" I asked how. It transpired that, though Bill hated shooting more than one take, for one crucial scene he did six. Unfortunately, the tape had got twisted during the perfect take. \"He ruined ma shot,\" he screamed. \"He's ruining ma film!\" He waved wildly: \"I won't work with them.\" I replied: \"That's the best crew I can find. If they're not good enough, I'll cancel the film. I'll ring the chairman.\" I got up. I am not sure, but I think I was bluffing. I walked slowly down the corridor to the public phone in an alcove. I picked it up - and heard a stampede. Bill was running towards me, followed by the crew. He snatched the phone from my hand and tied the cable round his neck. Luckily, he didn't go through with it. After the trilogy, Bill waited 10 years before making his next feature, Comrades, when, as managing director of the NFFC, I persuaded my board to commit the largest sum in its history. Channel 4, under Jeremy Isaacs, matched us, as did Roger Wingate of the Curzon cinema. It is another classic. After that, Bill wrote a screenplay for me entitled Justified Sinner, based on the James Hogg novel. But we could not get any production funding either from public or private sources. He did not make another film. \u00b7 The Bill Douglas Trilogy is released on DVD on June 23"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
