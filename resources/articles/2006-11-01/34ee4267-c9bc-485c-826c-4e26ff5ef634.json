The master couturier was at the palace to sign up to the Order of the British Empire, an honour bestowed on very few ace knits. Macdonald's clients include Gwyneth Paltrow, Liv Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, Nicole Kidman, Kate Winslet and just about every other celeb not currently in the Australian jungle. There's a Camilla on his list too, but she's Mohammed Al Fayed's daughter rather than the Duchess of Cornwall. Macdonald dressed sedately for the investiture in a bespoke Dunhill suit and open-necked black shirt, plus diamond pendant designed by David Morris, which HM admired. David Westwood lost his battle with the then home secretary David Blunkett in the aftermath of the Soham murders, but he's very well-respected in Humberside where he was chief constable until last year. He left by agreement after standing up to a critical approach over his force's failure to spot the murderer Ian Huntley as unsuitable to work as a school caretaker. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. So there's been a warm welcome for Westwood and his wife Wendy in their new role as keepers of a Fairtrade B&amp;B at their home in Hull, a bit echoey since their four children fledged. It only costs from \u00a325 a night. \"You change the world by small steps,\" says Westwood, who's a helper at St Ninian and St Andrew's church in Hull where Wendy is a director of the city's Fairtrade store. Good news for AA Milne and EH Shepard on their Heavenly clouds: the search for the world's first Pooh Laureate is over and the title has gone to nine-year-old Emma Flatt from Norwich. She was picked by judges including Winnie-the-Pooh fanatic Brian Sibley and Julia Strong of the National Literacy Trust after writing one of thousands of poems submitted by would-be mini-Andrew Motions. Here's an idea for Sir Alan Budd, just appointed head of a panel to check the balance of the BBC's business coverage. Why not invite director general Mark Thompson, the excellent Evan Davis and others into a version of the Dragon's Den? We could even watch and vote, as with Andrew Lloyd Webber's brilliantly successful hunt for Maria. martin.wainwright@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
