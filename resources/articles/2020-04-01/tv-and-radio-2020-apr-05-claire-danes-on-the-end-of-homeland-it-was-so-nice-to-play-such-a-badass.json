So it is fitting that Danes appears to this interviewer not in person but via FaceTime. \u201cLet me just get on to my wifi,\u201d she says, as the signal flickers, \u201cI thought I was. OK, that should be better.\u201d Danes and her husband, the British actor Hugh Dancy, who have two sons \u2013 a seven-year-old and an 18-month-old \u2013 are weathering the coronavirus storm at a country house two hours north of New York, by far the worst-hit US city. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of acclimatising to this crazy new reality where we FaceTime all the time with everybody.\u201d And like millions of other parents, the 40-year-old actor is suddenly dealing with the challenge of home-schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s full-on but I\u2019m trying to download math apps and order a bunch of workbooks and stuff from Amazon, hoping that\u2019ll keep them engaged.\u201d When the crisis erupted and brought daily life shuddering to a standstill, Danes had been enjoying her first few days back in \u201ccivilian\u201d life after a blitz of media interviews to mark the end of Homeland after eight seasons, 96 episodes and five Golden Globe awards. She had been looking forward to catching some theatre. In contrast with other art forms, pre-recorded television is immune to the virus (\u201cIt\u2019s a resilient medium, it turns out\u201d), and Homeland\u2019s last bow may get a ratings boost from a captive audience. They will be witnessing the end of a landmark of 21st-century television, a drama set in the world of espionage and counterterrorism that has thrilled, surprised, frustrated, courted controversy, disappointed and returned to form, swung between sublime and ridiculous and, above all, never been less than relevant. It is striking now that Homeland is often described as the first true post-9/11 drama when, in fact, it was born a full decade after the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. Perhaps events of such magnitude take that long to sink in, and we will have to wait 10 years for similarly rich drama reflecting the age of Donald Trump and the coronavirus. Created by Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon of 24 fame, Homeland never had the more writerly aspirations of Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Sopranos or The Wire. But it was always contemporary, urgent, looking outward and thinking big. It captured many Americans\u2019 ambivalence about the \u201cwar on terror\u201d and their role in the world and showed tremendous capacity for reinvention. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like origami,\u201d says Danes. \u201cYou just refold it and it becomes a slightly different creature. Its function was to mirror what was happening in the world and that\u2019s ever changing, so by definition it had places to move and grow, and it was never going to suffer too badly from stagnation. My character was so wildly dynamic there was always a new facet to start to explore.\u201d At its heart was a compelling relationship not, as first expected, between Mathison, a brilliant rule-breaker whose mind moves like jazz, and Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), a prisoner of war suspected of treason, but between Mathison and Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), who emerges as her mentor and father figure. \u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful and surprising love story,\u201d Danes reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s not one that we see depicted all that often in pop culture: mentor and mentee.\u201d The rapport with Patinkin was mirrored off screen \u201ckind of from the word go\u201d, Danes says. \u201cIn our first read-through the chemistry was really powerful and palpable. He looks uncannily like my best friend\u2019s dad, who kind of raised me and is a wonderful person but, if [he] got mad at you, you felt pretty shitty. I think that helped: very strong Pavlovian response already built in! And he\u2019s [Patinkin] just very good at what he does. Our partnership grew and deepened over time.\u201d When Danes and Patinkin filmed their final scene together, the end of Homeland truly sank in. She recalls: \u201cIt\u2019s not a casual scene. I think for me that was my cathartic moment when I realised it was over, because to say goodbye to it in its entirety is just too abstract and too huge. There were some tears \u2013 many of them \u2013 and we just hugged each other for a really long time.\u201d Danes was born in New York to artistic parents \u2013 a photographer and painter \u2013 and began learning modern dance when she was four years old. She was studying acting and performing on stage and screen by the age of 10, and landed her breakthrough role in My So-Called Life at 14, which took her to Los Angeles. She starred opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 1996 Romeo + Juliet before studying for two years at Yale University. Her bohemian upbringing was not obvious preparation for playing a cog in the wheel of the national security apparatus and, at times, an agent of American imperialism. \u201cI grew up in downtown New York, surrounded by artists and deeply liberal folks who had a lot of scepticism about these organisations and institutions,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re suddenly playing somebody who is in that world you can\u2019t help but be moved by their efforts. I was really struck by their patriotism, that people make profound sacrifices on behalf of our country. I took that very seriously.\u201d Adapted for the US Showtime network from Gideon Raff\u2019s Israeli series Prisoners of War, Homeland exploded into life in 2011, when water-cooler television was still a thing and a company called Netflix was working on its first original programme, House of Cards. Presumed dead, US marine sergeant Brody turns out to have been held as a prisoner of war by al-Qaida for eight years. He returns to America and a hero\u2019s welcome. But CIA officer Mathison can see something no else does: that Brody has been turned and is now a double agent poised to attack America. She sounds the alarm but is not believed \u2013 in part, because of her bipolar disorder. And then she and Brody have a fling. The first series dazzled critics, gained fans including Barack Obama and won Emmy awards for best lead actress, lead actor, drama series and writing for drama series. Season two maintained the momentum, including an audacious, much-praised episode in which Mathison interrogates Brody at great length. But in a recent Los Angeles Times interview, Gansa said \u201cit became much more difficult to write the show\u201d after that episode. A subplot in which Brody again becomes a double agent was \u201cstrained\u201d. The series indulged twists and turns that stretched credulity, and was in danger of \u201cjumping the shark\u201d. \u201cWhere Did Homeland Go Wrong?\u201d demanded the New Yorker magazine. The radical solution, apparently against Showtime\u2019s wishes, was amputation: Brody was killed off, publicly hanged from a crane in Tehran as punishment for killing the head of Iranian intelligence, with Mathison watching in horror. It was a chance for Homeland to start over. The team began attending an annual \u201cspy camp\u201d at the City Tavern Club in Georgetown, Washington DC, absorbing the accumulated insights and knowledge of current and former intelligence agents, diplomatic old hands and, one year, National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden. Speaking by phone, one of the participants in these brainstorming events, Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA, recalls: \u201cA lot of times it was, \u2018OK, what\u2019s happening now?\u2019 We talked about that and then they talked about whichever plot they were thinking about. It was a conversation. We then went to dinner and talked about it again. It\u2019s interesting, because the more we did it, the more they had our kind of questions.\u201d Danes has fond memories of the spy camps. \u201cThe days were long and dense,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d meet at nine and the revolving door was in constant motion, depositing one story and then another, and they were often told by people who had very different ideologies and political positions. It was a huge privilege because you really did get to look into a crystal ball from all these amazing sources and get a fairly clear picture of what our reality might be like in a year\u2019s time.\u201d Were there any surprises? \u201cWhen we first started the show, I didn\u2019t realise that Russians were a potentially difficult relationship. I thought we had worked through that! It\u2019s also just a shock that these people actually exist. I was interested in how that would inform a person\u2019s emotional makeup or their intimate relationships. You hear stories of people working [together] in really volatile posts for years on end and then they come home and separate: the adrenaline is gone. What it is to be so isolated, to carry all of those secrets, be shape-shifting, assuming different identities\u2026\u201d This brains trust helped Homeland take a new, more self-questioning direction. The first episode of season four was entitled \u201cThe Drone Queen\u201d, with Mathison in Kabul, Afghanistan, as the CIA\u2019s youngest ever station chief. She gives the go-ahead for a military strike on a wedding in Pakistan, killing dozens of innocent civilians. Season five shifted to Berlin, with Mathison having quit the CIA to work for a German billionaire philanthropist who, at one point, upbraids Berenson: \u201cNothing has made the world more dangerous than the foreign policy of the United States.\u201d The series also kept bumping up against real events. The crew was filming in Berlin just after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. Season six (early 2017) was even more spookily prescient on themes of fake news, Russian election interference and a president-elect at loggerheads with the intelligence community. It premiered five days before the inauguration of Trump, whose bellicose attacks on the FBI, CIA and so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d appalled Danes. \u201cWe worked with the intelligence community over the years, and I\u2019ve been playing somebody within it. It was hard not to feel real empathy and deep appreciation and loyalty. So when suddenly they were dismissed and undermined by a president, it was just so hard to believe.\u201d The final season has again given a voice to outside critics of American adventurism abroad, and again mirrored real events, this time with a president winding down the country\u2019s longest war, in Afghanistan. While there, Mathison is confronted by multiple gravestones bearing the same date of death, the consequence of her own past actions. And she comes full circle to find herself in Brody\u2019s shoes, under suspicion for possibly having been turned by a foreign adversary. Homeland\u2019s politics remains complex and problematic. Some argue that, in the later years, it sought redemption. Did Danes observe a conscious tilt to the left? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we were editorialising too much,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we were really just charting that curve. Our [America\u2019s] response to 9/11 was not great. We didn\u2019t identify the real source of danger and conflict and we were too reactionary and we betrayed a lot of our values because of the panic we were in. \u201cSo we kind of learned that as we went along. When I was talking to Alex [Gansa] about the final season, he framed it in a way that was helpful. He said when we first started telling our story, it was directly to do with our response to 9/11, and nearly a decade later we\u2019re wondering if we\u2019ve in fact learned anything, if we would react differently. \u201cHe simulated an event that would sort of be comparable in scale, as traumatising and as consequential, which is the president\u2019s helicopter going down. That was a litmus test. How do our characters in this story interpret that? Do they pause and judiciously consider their next move or do they go straight into offensive mode, a fear-based mode?\u201d One of the most enduring criticisms of the series is its portrayal of Muslims. Under the headline \u201cHomeland is the most bigoted show on television\u201d, writer and film-maker Laura Durkay wrote in the Washington Post in 2014: \u201cSince its first episode, Homeland has churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the cliche.\u201d The following year, Arab graffiti artists who had been hired by the producers to add realism to the set of Syrian refugee camp wrote: \u201cHomeland is racist.\u201d No one noticed and translated it until the episode was broadcast. It was, one comedian observed, a major intelligence failure. Danes acknowledges: \u201cThat was a good stunt. All of our hats were off to them.\u201d On the broader issue, she says: \u201cI get it. I think it\u2019s tricky and kind of inherently problematic, right? There are a lot of brown people in our story who are doing really bad things, and there aren\u2019t enough opportunities to create a more balanced portrait of that demographic. That was always going to be a point of vulnerability for us, but I also think that our heroes are really problematic and really flawed. We\u2019re wrestling with some pretty challenging questions and ideas and those two sides of various arguments were personified by our characters. \u201cIn most cases I think both characters were right. Our writers were fairly responsible about that, creating a real debate. In the first episode of this season we have the Palestinian politician who\u2019s really challenging Saul and making credible, cogent points about the ways that America has failed. I was happy about that at least.\u201d Another sensitive area has been Homeland\u2019s portrayal of bipolar disorder. But Danes received positive feedback from people with the disorder. \u201cThey\u2019ve been mostly appreciative, which I feel great relief about and gratitude for. That condition is not dramatised all that often so I think any conversation that\u2019s stimulated by it is welcome. I never wanted her being bipolar to be a gimmick or just a convenient plot device, and I tried to be as specific and informed as possible. It\u2019s a really fascinating human condition. I developed such respect for people who work as diligently as they do to just make it through a day.\u201d Actors sometimes talk about taking a while to shake off their last part, as if the character lingers like a ghost. Will Danes, who is now thinking about originating her own material, miss Carrie Mathison? \u201cOh my gosh, so much,\u201d she says via the FaceTime link, where there will be no farewell handshake. \u201cI loved her. It was just so nice to play the smartest person in the room, somebody who was so daring and unapologetically ambitious and such a badass. She\u2019s not really going away.\u201d Homeland season eight screens on Channel 4 at 9pm (UK) and at 9pm on Showtime in the US. The entire series concludes on 26 April (US) and 3 May (UK)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
