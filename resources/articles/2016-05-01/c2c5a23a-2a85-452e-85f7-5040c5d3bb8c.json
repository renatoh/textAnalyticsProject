In a report, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) praises the Department for International Development (DfID) for demonstrating global leadership on the issue and helping to increase knowledge and evidence. Since 2012, DfID has almost doubled the number of programmes dedicated to tackling gender-based violence \u2013 from 64 to 127 \u2013 while spending has increased from \u00a320m to \u00a3184m. Two years ago, the UK hosted the high-profile, international Girl Summit to focus attention on ending child marriage and female genital mutilation. The study, billed as a learning review, gives DfID a green rating \u2013 the highest \u2013 saying the department has shown \u201cstrong achievement across the board\u201d and that UK aid is making a \u201csignificant positive contribution\u201d. But it warns the department that its efforts will not deliver \u201ctransformative impact\u201d until it scales up its projects, sets specific targets and indicators for its work, and collects the necessary data to help it assess whether its programmes yield value for money. Tina Fahm, Icai\u2019s lead commissioner for the review, said that while there was much to commend, DfID should not underestimate the work needed to tackle what the report terms a \u201cglobal epidemic\u201d of violence against women and girls. \u201cDfID should be praised for translating its ambitions and commitment into innovative and effective programmes with the potential to make a real difference to a daunting challenge,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a promising start, but it is only the beginning. The test now is for DfID to step up its work to tackle violence against women and girls, which remains small in scale when compared to the huge problem.\u201d The review advises DfID to use its influence to catalyse action from other countries and also highlights concerns that women\u2019s voices \u2013 especially those at grassroots level \u2013 are not being adequately heard. It suggests the department could do more to tackle violence by strengthening and funding local women\u2019s rights organisations and networks, describing it as a \u201crelatively neglected area in DfID\u2019s programming\u201d. Bethan Cansfield, acting head of policy for Womankind Worldwide, welcomed the report \u2013 particularly its findings on supporting grassroots organisations. \u201cEvidence shows that investing in women\u2019s rights organisations is the smart option: these organisations are providing innovative, locally relevant and, at times, at scale interventions to end violence against women and girls,\u201d she said. But despite their well-documented contribution, added Cansfield, women\u2019s rights organisations often struggle to carry out their work because of lack of funding. She added: \u201cWe hope DfID urgently and significantly increases funding for women\u2019s rights organisations to ensure [their] important work continues.\u201d Anne Quesney, women\u2019s rights advocacy adviser at ActionAid, said: \u201cThe report demonstrates that when policy commitments are prioritised, progress happens. We are calling on the UK government to commit to boosting the proportion of aid going directly to women\u2019s rights groups working on the frontline. ActionAid [recommends] at least \u00a370m over the next three years to be taken from the existing aid budget.\u201d A DfID spokesperson said: \u201cThis report is absolutely right to underline Britain\u2019s leading role in the global effort to put a stop to violence against women and girls. \u201cBut there is more to do, which is why we continue to put their rights and wellbeing at the heart of our development programme, helping millions of women and girls around the world build a future free from suffering.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
