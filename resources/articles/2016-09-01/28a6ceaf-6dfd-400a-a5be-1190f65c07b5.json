The Telegraph alleged the Dutchman requested a fee of \u00a355,000 to work for a fake Far Eastern firm seeking to sell players to the club. In video footage collected by the newspaper, Hasselbaink is seen asking his suitors to \u201ccome up with a nice figure\u201d for a role, which the newspaper says he is told would involve a number of trips to meet with the firm in Singapore. Hasselbaink says: \u201cYou said the word business. That\u2019s all, it\u2019s business, so it depends what you put down, you know \u2026 At the end of the day, it has to be worthwhile to go all that way.\u201d The Championship club have not suspended Hasselbaink, saying they have confidence in him, but added that the 44-year-old will be investigated. In a statement, QPR said: \u201cThe club is aware of the allegations made against QPR manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in the Telegraph. \u201cFirst and foremost, the club takes very seriously any alleged breach of the rules. With this in mind, the club can confirm that there will be a thorough internal investigation regarding this matter. However, we have every confidence in our manager and the robust systems and processes the club has in place.\u201d Hasselbaink, who took over at QPR in December, issued a statement in which he denied any impropriety and said he saw nothing unusual in the prospective deal. Hasselbaink said: \u201cI have today, through my lawyers, responded in full to the accusations levelled against me by the Telegraph. \u201cI was approached by Mr McGarvey and Ms Newell of the Telegraph purporting to be players\u2019 agents. They offered me a fee to make a speech in Singapore. I do not see anything unusual in being offered to be paid to make a speech. I did not make any promises in return. I did not ask QPR to purchase any of the players who were said to be managed by Mr McGarvey and Ms Newell and did not and would not recommend the purchase of a player for my personal gain. I deny any accusations of wrongdoing on my part.\u201d In a separate development, Barnsley have suspended their assistant head coach Tommy Wright following allegations that he took a \u00a35,000 bung to help place players at his club. The Daily Telegraph said that Wright accepted the money during a series of meetings during which he agreed to help sign players part-owned by the firm. The Championship club said in a statement: \u201cBarnsley FC is aware of allegations made by the Telegraph against Tommy Wright. The club has today suspended Tommy pending an internal investigation into these allegations.\u201d A spokesman for Wright is quoted as saying: \u201cAny suggested acts contrary to criminal law or those of the FA and Fifa are categorically denied.\u201d The Telegraph further alleges the Leeds owner, Massimo Cellino, explained ways to circumvent FA and Fifa rules on transfers. In video footage obtained by the Telegraph of a meeting between the 60-year-old and a fictitious investment firm, the Italian appears to suggest to the firm it could become a club shareholder in order to receive a portion of players\u2019 sell-on fees. FA and Fifa rules ban third-party ownership of players, and third parties receiving any percentage of a player\u2019s transfer fees. Cellino said in the video: \u201cI tell you, I spend eight million this year \u2026 on new players. You want to finance that? You want to come 20% in that? You got 20% of the player \u2013 it\u2019s the only way. As a shareholder you can finance the club, asking everything you want \u2013 percentage \u2013 you are allowed to do it in England.\u201d In a statement issued late on Wednesday night, Leeds described the allegations relating to Cellino as a \u201cnon-story\u201d. The statement read: \u201cThe club has reviewed the supposed \u2018evidence\u2019 that the Daily Telegraph have published tonight. At no time in this video clip has Mr Cellino suggested getting around the FA\u2019s rules on third-party ownership of players. \u201cIn complete contrast to what has been suggested, Mr Cellino has made a perfectly proper suggestion which is entirely consistent with the FA\u2019s regulations, as the only parties entitled to take benefit from ownership of a player is the club itself. \u201cIf a company commits money to a club by way of investment, taking on the potential for profit but also the risk for loss, then that is a normal, every-day corporate process. This is plainly not a suggestion as to how to circumvent the rules, but rather, an accurate albeit concise explanation of how to operate within the confines of the rules and effectively become \u2018the club\u2019. The club intends to make no further comment on this non-story.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
