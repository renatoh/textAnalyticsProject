The union's general secretary, Billy Hayes, said the union would reduce its funding by \u00a3500,000 over the next three years - around 30% of the CWU's usual donation. \"Like any other organisations, we have a limited budget. We have to make decisions about how best to campaign on behalf of our members in the postal industry, in the Girobank and in telecommunications,\" he said. The CWU, the largest postal workers' union, has threatened strike action over plans by Consignia, formerly the Post Office, to axe a further 10,000 staff in addition to almost 5,000 cuts announced earlier in the year. Mr Hayes said the money would be used to fund a campaign against the \"privatisation\" of the Post Office. \"We are fighting to end the deregulation, and de facto privatisation, of the postal industry; we are struggling to assure a future for our financial services members, especially in the Girobank; and we are campaigning for a broadband Britain in which BT has a leading role. All these things cost money.\" Mr Hayes said any loss of members' jobs in the Post Office would adversely affect his union's finances. He denied that the donation cut was a symbolic gesture. \"Clearly I think they will take notice, I hope they will take notice,\" he said. \"We value the institutional link with the Labour party. Remember, the last time this was broken was at the instigation of the rightwing government of Stanley Baldwin in 1927. We have no desire to return to those dark days.\" Two weeks ago the CWU staged a large demonstration in central London to protest against Consignia's job cuts. Several CWU branch secretaries have submitted motions calling for an end to automatic donations to the Labour party, arguing that Consignia's plans conflict with the interests of its members."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
