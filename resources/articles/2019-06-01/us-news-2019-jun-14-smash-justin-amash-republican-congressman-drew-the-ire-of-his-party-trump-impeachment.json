Wayne Weller, from nearby Grandville, echoed that: \u201cHe\u2019s so far out there that he\u2019s a Democrat.\u201d Even with the venom directed toward Amash, the event was also somewhat festive. It was Flag Day, Donald Trump\u2019s birthday and the anti-Amash protesters sang Happy Birthday to Trump as they waved flags, waved inflatable rhinos and a pro-Trump float circled the block. The mass protest was the latest \u2013 and most highly visible \u2013 wave of blowback against Amash since the 39-year-old libertarian-leaning Republican declared on Twitter that Trump engaged in impeachable conduct by obstructing justice during the Robert Mueller investigation. It was also the latest sign that dissent in Trump\u2019s Republican party is not to be tolerated and that those who break ranks will bring down the ire of the party machine, the White House itself and Trump\u2019s fervent supporters. Amash has been the lone sitting Republican congressman to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment, and his political career \u2013 at least in his own party \u2013 is now very much in question. In the days following his tweet, several Republicans announced that they would challenge Amash for his seat in 2020. A poll released this week by the Michigan political news outlet MIRS put one of those challengers, the pro-Trump state congressman Jim Lower, up by 16 points in a hypothetical head-to-head match-up. Amash\u2019s impeachment stance predictably drew the president\u2019s hostile attention too. \u201cJustin is a loser who sadly plays right into our opponent\u2019s hands!\u201d Trump tweeted. This week, the Trump administration suggested it may support an Amash challenger in the primary, and the Republican National Committee is considering the rare step of backing an incumbent\u2019s opponent. Last week, the billionaire DeVos family, of which the education secretary, Betsy, is a part, announced it would cut off financial support for Amash. The mega donors have directly contributed $300,000 to his campaign throughout his career. That news came just as Amash announced his resignation from the conservative House Freedom Caucus that he co-founded several years ago. He faced criticism from the group, though it stopped short of forcibly removing him. However, if Amash is fazed by the blowback, he isn\u2019t publicly showing it, and he isn\u2019t new to the pressure of being at odds with party leadership. He landed in office when Republicans and the Tea Party took control of Congress in the 2010 midterms, and like many of those who were part of that wave, he hasn\u2019t always played by Republican leadership\u2019s rules. While Republicans generally vote with the party about 95% of the time, Amash has only done so about 62% of the time throughout his career. He recently broken with Trump on the border wall, the Saudi Arabian war, tariffs and loosening firearm regulations. When Donald Trump Jr trash talked on Twitter this week Amash zinged the president\u2019s son. \u201cSee you soon Justin\u2026 I hear Michigan is beautiful during primary season,\u201d Trump Jr tweeted. \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\u201d Amash responded, quoting a 2016 email Trump Jr sent ahead of the Trump Tower meeting in which a Kremlin-linked lawyer offered dirt on Hillary Clinton. Moreover, Amash says he has more support than his party is aware of. He told the Detroit News that some of his Republican colleagues privately said they agree with him, but he declined to name them. He also told the outlet this week he was \u201cconfident\u201d of his re-election chances. At a recent town hall on the issue, Amash stressed Congress\u2019s \u201cduty to keep the president in check\u201d. \u201cI believe in the people I represent,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the people are smart enough to figure out what\u2019s going on \u2026 The president did much worse than I did in this district.\u201d Meshawn Maddock, one of the organizers of the Grand Rapids protest, dismissed that idea. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore this \u2013 he\u2019s directly attacking the president,\u201d Maddock said. \u201cHe\u2019s a libertarian. Actually he just needs to stop running as a Republican and come out as a libertarian.\u201d Amash may do just that. There are rumors that Amash will seek the Libertarian party\u2019s 2020 nomination, which he did not rule out at a recent town hall. Were he successful in seeking the party\u2019s nomination, he could potentially do serious damage by siphoning Republican votes from Trump in a state that the president won by only 10,000 votes. \u201cI\u2019ve said many times, I don\u2019t rule things like that out,\u201d Amash said. \u201cIf you\u2019re fighting to defend the constitution, if you find a way to do that that\u2019s different and maybe more effective, then you have to think about that.\u201d But those who gathered in Grand Rapids were convinced Amash was living out his final days in politics. \u201cIf President Trump were here today, he would say \u2018Justin, you\u2019re fired!\u2019\u201d Maddock told the protesters to loud cheers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
