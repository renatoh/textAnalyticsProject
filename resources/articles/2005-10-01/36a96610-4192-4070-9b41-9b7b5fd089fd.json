Of Guardian Unlimited's 12 million monthly users the majority are from outside the UK. But just as we welcome this growth in readership, being \"local everywhere\" can bring problems which were formerly rare or non-existent. In the past two weeks we have encountered fairly urgent situations where how we are viewed outside the UK has meant us having to take prompt editorial action and make decisions or deletions in a way we would not have needed to if we had just been a paper-based product. The first occurred with the brief but alarming abduction of our journalist Rory Carroll in Iraq. It is for security reasons too difficult to go into detail about exactly what measures had to be taken online during the 36 hours Rory was missing, but our first - and only - concern was for his safety. As the Guardian's managing editor, Chris Elliott, reminded all journalists, a word out of place could have disastrous consequences. For the web, this meant talkboards and blogs had to be monitored or turned off, and at times we had to remove articles from the site. Advice left us in no doubt that the abductors were likely to be checking what the site carried, and, nearly as worryingly for us, how other sites might reproduce what we carried. With this in mind we had translated statements into Arabic, with the help of other media organisations, and put them on to the site. Every piece we put out about Rory or abductions in Iraq had to be carefully vetted and considered in the context of how it might be received. Even though Rory is free, the episode gave us all a profound reminder of how and what we publish, where and when, now carries ramifications far beyond what the paper would once have considered its traditional readership. In a different and less dramatic instance we had a similar issue with the Peter Falconio murder trial in Australia, where the judge's strictures on what can and cannot appear in the Northern Territories' media are severe. To all intents and purposes this means that we too are affected by these seemingly \"local\" judgments. If the paper carried details of the trial allowed outside but not inside the restricted area then legal changes must be made to articles before they appear on the web. The potential implications of prejudicing a lengthy trial because of a contempt do not bear thinking about. But legal deletions add a burden to our production desk and also to the Guardian's legal team. As a newspaper's archive on a free website is generally available then, from a defamation perspective, a story can be deemed by court to be published every time someone downloads it. There can be legal issues, too, in relation to criminal cases. In the case a few years ago involving the retrial of Leeds footballers Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer, this meant removing from our database all articles relating to the case for the duration of the trial. Once you have removed something wholesale from your own site there is the issue of it sitting on other blogs or in the search engines of sites such as Google - from which you can request, but not always obtain, a deletion. Deleting an article from our archive - or altering a paper article in any way online - is not to be done lightly, as altering the history of the archive has many philosophical and editorial implications, which is why we tend only to delete articles for legal reasons, or after consultation with the reader's editor, Ian Mayes. The old-fashioned idea that a newspaper \"buries\" its mistakes online could not be more wrong - or more dangerous. \u00b7 Emily Bell is editor-in-chief of Guardian Unlimited emily.bell@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
