A patient who has been out of touch for that long will receive two letters, and if they do not respond, they will be taken off their GP\u2019s list. NHS England says the scheme will ensure that it does not waste vital funds by paying GPs about \u00a3100 a year for looking after \u201cghost patients\u201d \u2013 those who have died, moved away or no longer want their local surgery\u2019s services. But GP leaders have asked for the initiative to be scrapped and warned that it will lead to patients being excluded for no good reason and deprive surgeries of money they need to keep running. Pulse, a website for GPs, has discovered that NHS England plans to introduce the deregistration scheme at all 8,000 GP surgeries across England after a trial. It has drawn up a contract with Capita that sets out how the company will go about delisting patients. It says: \u201cThe supplier shall contact all GP practices in the 11th month of every contract year requesting a list of all patients who are recorded as not having had contact with the GP practice in the past five years.\u201d After it has received those lists, Capita will contact each patient \u201cwithin 10 working days\u201d to check their \u201ccurrent address and registration details\u201d. If the patient does not reply they will face being removed from the practice list within six months if the GP still cannot contact them. GPs in eastern England voiced fears that the pilot scheme would lead to key groups \u2013 notably children, but also men aged between 20 and 45 who are seen as more likely not to respond to prompts \u2013 missing out on access to GP care because of \u201clist cleaning\u201d. Dr Robert Morley, chair of the contracts and regulations subcommittee of the British Medical Association\u2019s GPs committee, said: \u201cPatients have a right to be registered unless they move or register elsewhere, even if they don\u2019t need to or choose not to access services. NHS England should abandon this exercise, which will have the inevitable consequences of disruption for patients and a reduction of core funding disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable practices.\u201d But NHS England defended the move. \u201cThe National Audit Office and House of Commons public accounts committee have all drawn attention to the need to ensure accurate patient lists, and for proper stewardship of public funds,\u201d a spokeswoman said. The Royal College of GPs backed the move but demanded safeguards to ensure patients were not wrongly delisted. Dr Maureen Baker, the RCGP\u2019s chair, said: \u201cThere may be very good reasons why a patient should no longer be on a GP practice\u2019s list. They may have died, moved away, or in some cases they may have moved into a care home that is served by a different practice. \u201cIt makes sense that lists are kept as accurate and up to date as possible \u2013 but methods for doing this must be properly risk-assessed, so that practices can be assured there are no patient safety implications.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
