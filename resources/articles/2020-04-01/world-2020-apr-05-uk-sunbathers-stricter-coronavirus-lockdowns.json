Despite Sunday\u2019s warm temperatures, fewer people visited parks than usual, but scenes in Brockwell Park in south London on Saturday \u2013 where 3,000 people gathered \u2013 were widely condemned and led to the park being temporarily closed. Police said they also had to move more than 100 people from Primrose Hill in London after they were found with \u201cfull picnics or blankets, sunbathing\u201d. On Sunday morning, Hancock said he could be forced to take action before later saying that any change would not be immediate. He told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI think this example of exercise is a really important one, because we\u2019ve said because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health that it\u2019s OK to exercise on your own or with members of your own household. \u201cBut if the result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say: \u2018Well, if I can exercise then it\u2019s fine for me to do other things,\u2019 then I\u2019m afraid we will have to take action.\u201d But he later clarified his position, saying: \u201c\u2018We can\u2019t rule out further steps but I don\u2019t want anyone to think that any changes to the social distancing rules are imminent, because the vast majority are following the rules.\u201d The temporary closure of Brockwell Park and images of sunbathers from around the country triggered a debate about the use of parks by people who do not have accessible outdoor space during the Covid-19 lockdown. Hancock was backed by the newly-elected Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said his party would support either a ban on outdoor exercise or on non-essential work if it was needed to curb the spread of Covid-19. \u201cWe do have to take whatever steps are necessary,\u201d said Starmer, who said social distancing was difficult for people who did not have a garden to exercise in, but insisted \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get through this\u201d. Angela Rayner, who was elected as Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said on Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cIt\u2019s all right for people who\u2019ve got big houses and huge back gardens to say that, but if you\u2019re stuck in inadequate accommodation, you\u2019ve got no back garden, nowhere to go, and you\u2019re on top of each other, people should do social distancing, but also be reasonable and proportionate about that.\u201d The Royal Parks \u2013 the charity that manages several parks in London, including Primrose Hill, Greenwich Park and Hyde Park, which were all busy over the weekend \u2013 said its spaces would remain open for now. \u201cOur sole priority at the moment is to keep the parks open and safe for as long as possible, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to ensure this is the case,\u201d a spokesperson said. The charity has previously banned cycling through Richmond Park because of congestion and shut all cafes, catering kiosks and playgrounds at its sites. Officials in Birmingham, which has had the largest amount of confirmed Covid-19 cases of any local authority outside of London, encouraged residents to practise social distancing while continuing to keep its parks open. London Councils \u2013 the membership group representing the 32 London boroughs and the City of London \u2013 said if people failed to follow government advice stricter restrictions on movement could follow. Wail Qasim, the writer and social commentator, used Brockwell Park on Saturday and questioned the logic behind the decision to close it on Sunday, saying it punished the many because of the actions of the few. \u201cBrockwell Park is 50.8 hectares of space. Even if all 3,000 people were in there at the same time they could have 169 square metres alone each,\u201d Qasim tweeted. \u201cYou\u2019re taking green space away from many who have no other option. Please deal with the groups instead of collectively punishing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
