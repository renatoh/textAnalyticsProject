Thames is trying to sell one of its most controversial assets, in eastern Jakarta. The utility, which is under fire in Britain for raising prices despite a high rate of leaks, was criticised by Indonesia's regulator and water authority over concerns about the proposed buyer of its 95% stake in PT Thames PAM Jaya (TPJ). Thames signed a deal worth tens of millions of pounds last week to sell its stake in TPJ; the 5% owned by its local subsidiary, PT Terra Metta Phora, and debts. But under the terms of its concession, - which Thames obtained in 1997 after taking Sigit Harjojudanto, eldest son of the then-dictator, General Suharto, as a 20% partner - the sale of more than 49% of the shares requires the Jakarta administration's approval. Jakarta has asked for international consultants to conduct due diligence into the unnamed buyers. Ahmad Lanti, head of the Jakarta water regulator, said: \"We are worried that these companies are not water operators. They are not on Google and if the rumours are true they are politically very well-connected. Jakarta's water is too important to become a political commodity.\" Aburizal Bakrie, minister for peoples' welfare, is alleged to be connected to one of the proposed buyers. The inquiry is expected to take up to three months. Mr Lanti said he was worried about senior TPJ staff being kept on by the new owner. \"Thames's performance has been poor but its tariffs are the highest in south-east Asia so it would not be sensible to keep the same people in charge,\" he said, citing the 50% leakage rate as an example of poor performance. Haryadi Priyohutomo, director of Jakarta's water board, said Thames should settle its outstanding debts of more than \u00a32m before completing any sale. Mr Lanti agrees. \"If the new owner takes on these debts, the only way to get the money back is through tariffs and they will have to rise more than consumers can take to achieve this,\" he said. \"I would object to any deal worth more than 100bn rupiah [\u00a35.8m].\" No one from Thames or TPJ would comment but one source denied prices would have to rise much and expressed confidence it would be approved. Thames said it would make a statement next week. Thames's involvement in Indonesia has been beset by problems since 1997. Within months of signing the deal, the Asian financial crash and the toppling of Suharto plunged its investment into turmoil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
