Jeff Nankivell, Canada\u2019s consul general in Hong Kong and Macao, told a parliamentary committee the federal government had drafted plans to assist nearly 300,000 Canadians living in in the territory if the security situation deteriorated. \u201cWe do have detailed plans in place and we have resources available and identified to cover a range of situations up to, and including, a situation where the urgent departure of a large number of Canadians would be necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cThe likelihood of that kind of extreme scenario appears right now to be low, but it\u2019s our job to plan for the most extreme situations.\u201d The potential need for evacuation plans was underlined by China\u2019s decision in the summer to enact a controversial security measure. The law, which critics say has criminalised activism and dissent in Hong Kong, has stifled pro-democracy movements and had a chilling effect on media, education and politics. Nankivell\u2019s testimony is likely to further escalate tensions between China and Canada. After Ottawa expressed support for activists in Hong Kong, China\u2019s ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, said any \u201cinterference in China\u2019s domestic affairs\u201d could potentially jeopardise the \u201c the good health and safety\u201d of Canadian citizens living in in the territory. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, quickly condemned the ambassador\u2019s remarks, and accused China of \u201ccoercive diplomacy.\u201d Canada has plans for a large-scale evacuation, but Nankivell said his staff were unable to help asylum seekers looking for protection at the consulate. \u201cThe global policy of Canada, similar to most other countries, is that our diplomatic missions, including consulates, do not accept applications of asylum at our offices from people who are in their own territory,\u201d he said, adding that no one had yet tried to claim asylum. In contrast to Canada\u2019s evacuation plans, the UK has said it would extend immigration rights to Hong Kong residents who hold a British National Overseas (BNO) passport. There are currently 300,000 BNO passport holders \u2013 those who were born before the 1997 handover of the British territory \u2013 but as many as 3 million people could qualify. China has criticised the plan. Its foreign ministry recently told the UK to \u201cimmediately correct its mistakes\u201d and rescind the offer, according to Reuters. The new visas would permit five-year entry, as opposed to the current six months, and applications open on 31 January. The UK has not yet said what measures are in place to aid its 30,000 citizens living in Hong Kong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
