The Brits, who top the team table by a whisker from the French and the Germans, traditionally do well. Individually Pippa Funnell is second following the dressage leg, William Fox-Pitt is sixth and Leslie Law is 10th. Britain once dominated the sport, winning gold in 1956, 1968 and 1972, but have had to settle for silver in 1984, 1988 and 2000. Brits in action Richard Faulds The Sydney gold medallist will be defending his title in the men's double trap shooting event (12.15), with Italy's Marco Innocenti, Kuwait's Fehaid Aldeehani and the US's Walton Eller his main threats. Faulds, a man who likes a flutter, was only able to find one of his fellow shooters to have a bet with in practice, India's Rajyavardhan Rathore. The raffish Briton proceeded to relieve the gullible Rathore of \u00a330. Stephen Parry The 27-year-old scouser will be feeling confident after upstaging Michael Phelps in the semi-final of the 200m butterfly yesterday. Phelps, of course, will be feeling more confident. Also in action: The conditions are likely to be rowable if rough today for the repechages and if so single scull Ian Lawson (14.50pm) should win his race to move into the semi-finals. Helen Casey and Tracy Langlands (16.01), the women's lightweight doubles who took bronze in the 2002 worlds, should also progress ahead of a tough Spanish outfit. Other highlights The women's team gymnastics (20.15) often give us memorable moments and the defending champions Romania, Russia, the US and China should provide a keenly fought contest. Svetlana Khorkina, a Russian Playboy pin-up, is likely to attract some attention from the otherwise uncommitted. Weird and wonderful Sada Jacobson, the US world No1 in the women's individual sabre competition (18.35), isn't the only athlete in her family in Athens - her little sister, Emily, is also a member of the sabre team. Their inspiration? \"Definitely the fight scene in The Princess Bride.\" True Olympian Leontien Zijlaard-Van Moorsel will defend her Olympic time-trial title tomorrow despite the heavy bruising on her arms, hip and neck sustained in a crash during the weekend road race. \"In a time trial everything hurts anyway,\" said the triple gold medalist from Sydney.
