It's not a dramatic departure, more a tiptoe across the border. Excerpts from their respective solo routines are incorporated, perhaps to keep the fans sweet. Hegley begins with several ditties, written over 15 years in cities around the world. They guide us from his Luton childhood to idle nights as a globetrotting wordsmith. The playlet, which derives from the poetry, stars Hegley as himself and Munnery as everyone else in a story of romance sought, found and lost on a weekend in a provincial guesthouse. It's not especially theatrical, nor are we taken on much of a narrative journey. The pair essay occasional, Right Size-style mischief with stage convention (with help from Nigel Piper's score), but seem to be performing in a low gear: this has the feel of a work- in-progress. They should have faith in their idea. The audience, eager to enjoy two fringe veterans branching out, is on their side. At its best, the play - populated by a typical Hegley gallery of half-glimpsed oddballs - is sui generis: a verse comedy cabaret in the poet's characteristic, insistently punning cadences. \"She's the pick of the bunch and I'll stick to my hunch or I'll bring up my lunch and my tea,\" says Munnery's Tony. It's a playful new mode of storytelling; now they must convince us they have a story that deserves it. \u0095 Until Sunday. Box office: 0131-228 1404.
