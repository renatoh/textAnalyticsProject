They were killed, over the course of just 100 days, simply for who they were. Afterwards, the international community provided food, water and tents. Countries offered help with the reconstruction of Rwanda\u2019s physical infrastructure. But the psychological distress of the trauma that children, women and men had suffered went largely ignored. Our news is still full of the horrors of war and the physical destruction it leaves in its wake. It is only right that this makes the headlines. But we hardly ever hear about the mental suffering of individuals, families and entire communities. A serious omission. The war may be over; their trauma is not. In conflict or post-conflict situations, many people suffer from mental health conditions. Traumatic experiences increase the risk of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. According to a publication by the World Health Organization, at least one in five people in a conflict situation develops mental health conditions. But in these settings, fewer than one in 10 has access to professional care. Roughly 40% of children in conflict have severe emotional issues. And 12% of the world\u2019s population lives in an active conflict zone. Mental healthcare in such situations is, at best, only a secondary concern. This is a flawed response to deep human suffering, especially at a time when the number of conflicts is increasing and their complexity growing. In 2016, the number of armed conflicts reached an all-time high. Millions of people worldwide have been forcibly displaced by violence and conflict. The consequences are colossal. Children growing up in a war become a wounded generation. They suffer the loss of human dignity. A generation that is itself unstable has trouble passing on stability to their own children. This means that a community can never move on. Trauma and severe mental distress do not just go away. Coordinated assistance is needed. To me, it is clear that psychosocial support is not a luxury, but a necessity. It needs to be part of basic service provision, as normal as food, water and tents. Mental health and psychosocial support should be available to all people in conflict and post-conflict situations. Neglecting people\u2019s mental suffering \u2013 staying silent \u2013 is not an option. If we truly want to help a country with reconstruction, we shouldn\u2019t just rebuild the bombed bridges. We should also help people repair their broken souls. Humanitarian organisations are doing what they can. Survival of the body, not the soul, is their first concern. That\u2019s understandable, but it\u2019s only half of the solution. Access to mental healthcare is a human right. This is already the case in theory. But it should also be happening in practice. The good news: there are already many initiatives. But they are too dispersed and isolated to be effective. That is why I am campaigning for greater focus on psychosocial support. I will do so in concert with partners such as the UN children\u2019s agency, Unicef, the WHO and the International Red Cross. And I will urge my counterparts from other countries to act, too. In October, I will also host an international conference on the subject in Amsterdam. I want everyone to understand the devastating long-term effects of mental suffering. Mental healthcare must be recognised as a basic need. And it should be made structurally available. Now is the time to act. Investing in mental wellbeing is an investment in prevention, in reconstruction and in human dignity. It\u2019s an investment in people, in a stable foundation, in the future. We should all work together on this. Mental health was neglected in Rwanda 25 years ago. We must ensure we do everything we can to tackle it in today\u2019s conflicts.
