All Messiaen's works are celebrations of his Roman Catholic faith, but this particular statement of belief, composed between 1965 and 1969, seems one of the most profound. The Latin texts, from St Matthew, the Psalms and St Thomas Aquinas, are delivered ritualistically by the choir in rhythmic unison, while the orchestra and the soloists dance around them, with a profusion of birdsong punctuated by echoing bells. The pace is very measured, and the movements get more extended as the work goes on, as if reaching out for eternity. It has been recorded before, in the 1970s, but this sonically sumptuous performance is now the one to hear. Vivaldi: Il Giustino Labelle/Comparato/Provvisionato/McGreevy/De Lisi/Cherici/ Il Complesso Barocco/Curtis (Virgin, two CDs) *** Vivaldi's operas are rarely performed today; Il Giustino, though, crops up more often than most. This dramma per musica was written for the Rome carnival in 1724. Its story of the peasant Giustino being guided by the goddess Fortuna to the head of the Byzantine army, leading them to victory over the Scythians and finally becoming emperor of Rome, provides plenty of opportunity for vividly illustrative music. The pastoral scene-setting, battles and birdsong are realised with great glee and vividness in this live recording by Il Complesso Barocco. The conductor Alan Curtis has made what he calls \"judicious\" cuts in the score, losing one character and tying up some loose ends to make a more cogent piece of music drama. Thalberg: Fantasias on Operas by Rossini Francesco Nicolosi (Naxos) *** Sigismond Thalberg (1812-1871) was a contemporary of Franz Liszt and his pianistic rival in the Parisian salons of the 1830s. Like Liszt he composed prodigiously: he completed a couple of (unsuccessful) operas, but most of his output was piano music. Operatic paraphrases and fantasias were one of his specialities - even Liszt played some of Thalberg's arrangements - and Rossini was a favourite source. The four on this disc, adroitly if not dashingly played by Francesco Nicolosi, are based upon Semiramide, La Donna del Lago, The Barber of Seville and Moses. The treatment is more or less standard: one aria is chosen as the focus of the embellishments and other themes from the opera are woven around it. It is not great music, but it is enjoyable and effective."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
