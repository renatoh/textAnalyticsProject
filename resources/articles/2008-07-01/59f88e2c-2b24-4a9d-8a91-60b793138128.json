The BBC accounts for a good proportion of these, including the top five most powerful women in UK media. Top of the heap is Jane Tranter, the BBC controller of fiction, who is number 10 on the overall MediaGuardian 100. Tranter is responsible for drama, comedy, film and acquisitions across the corporation's entire television output and her stamp is on shows such as Cranford, Life on Mars and the new Doctor Who. Meanwhile, the second most powerful woman in media - and the 18th most powerful person overall - is Jay Hunt, the newly installed controller of BBC1. Hunt rejoined the BBC in May, lured back to the corporation after just a few months as director of programmes at Channel Five. Lesley Douglas, the controller of BBC Radio 2 and 6Music and BBC popular music, the most powerful woman on last year's list and ninth overall, has fallen down the list to 19th and third among the women. The fourth most powerful woman, Jana Bennett, the BBC director of vision, fell from 11th to 21st place in the overall 100. Bennett has creative and leadership responsibility for all of the BBC's television channels but in the past year her reputation was tarnished by a series of deception scandals. Her colleague, Helen Boaden, the BBC director of news, moved up the MediaGuardian 100 six places to 23rd. In the past year, Boaden has reorganised the BBC's news division, including the introduction of a multimedia newsroom incorporating TV, radio and online, and seen off the challenge of ITV1's revived News at Ten. Writer and actor Ruth Jones is a new entrant on the list as one half of the duo behind BBC3 sitcom Gavin &amp; Stacey. The Pearson chief executive, Dame Marjorie Scardino, has climbed the list from 41st to 26th, having overseen an upturn in the fortunes of the Financial Times. Another riser is Elisabeth Murdoch, who was 54th on MediaGuardian 100 last year. Murdoch is now 27th on the rundown, having cemented her influence with the $125m (\u00a363m) buy-up of Reveille, the US company behind Ugly Betty and the American version of The Office. The Sun editor, Rebekah Wade, has fallen from 23rd to 30th. Rounding out the top 10 most powerful women is the Guardian Media Group chief executive, Carolyn McCall, who rose from 46th to 35th, after overseeing GMG's \u00a31bn purchase of Emap's business-to-business magazine and events arm with joint venture partner Apax. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
