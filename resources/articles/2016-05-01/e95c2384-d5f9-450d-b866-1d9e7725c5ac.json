Back then he was more interested in playing \u201cWembley\u201d \u2013 the goalmouth game needing only a ball and two posts \u2013 with friends on the estate, while thousands of supporters descended on his London borough. This year will be different. On his mum\u2019s birthday, Bolasie will lead Crystal Palace\u2019s hopes of a first FA Cup, against Manchester United. The gilded edge on the Eagles\u2019 wing has been one of the more dynamic attacking forces in English football this season, and he is ready for the biggest game of his career. \u201cThe journey I\u2019ve personally taken over the past four years with Palace, it\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d Bolasie says. \u201cScoring early in the semi-final did a lot for me personally. Now I am just looking forward to playing in the final and expressing myself, enjoying myself and showing the world what I can do.\u201d He has done that in the Premier League and it was no coincidence Palace\u2019s downturn this season, beginning in December, coincided with an injury to Bolasie. Before then, Alan Pardew\u2019s side had been flying but, although recent league performances have left a little to be desired, the Cup run has provided renewed exuberance. Bolasie\u2019s journey from playground to professional has not been simple. There was no academy for him, no easy path to the top. The DR Congo international, born in France but raised in London, started as a youngster at Hillingdon Borough and his road took him to Floriana in Malta before a return to England with Plymouth Argyle. Loans to Barnet followed, Bristol City signed him in 2011 and then Palace came calling. The rest has been for all to see, a remarkable progression from a wide player with pace and mesmeric feet to a consistently brilliant winger. There have been bumps along the way \u2013 Bolasie still smarts at missing out on the 2013 Championship play-off final when Ian Holloway was the Palace manager \u2013 but with Wilfried Zaha back many Premier League full-backs have left Selhurst Park with scrambled brains this season. Zaha is flourishing in south London once more after an ill-fated spell at United and Bolasie believes having a wide threat on the opposite flank benefits his own game. \u201cWhen we were both in the Championship, in my first season here, nobody knew about me, so everybody was concentrating on Wilf,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen Wilf go to United, coming back, teams starting to concentrate more on me a bit. \u201cWe get along obviously off the pitch but he\u2019s got his life and I\u2019ve got mine. We\u2019re at totally different stages: I\u2019ve got two kids so I\u2019ve got responsibilities. For myself, I just like to relax and chill out with the family.\u201d It was only when Bolasie was 14 that he began to dream of a football career, watching Thierry Henry score a hat-trick for Arsenal at San Siro against Internazionale. Yet this week he has had time to reflect on his ascent, posting a picture of a Willesden playground on social media alongside the caption: \u201cWhere it all began.\u201d \u201cThat is the estate where I grew up,\u201d says Bolasie, who was going to arrange a special coach to Wembley on Saturday for his mum, Yolande, before realising it would probably be quicker to walk. \u201cFrom my estate, where my mum still lives now, from my bedroom you could see Wembley. I go back a lot, my brothers are still there and she does a lot of cooking for me. To try to get a coach doesn\u2019t make sense, Willesden to Wembley. You can\u2019t do that really. \u201cThe way I\u2019ve grown up, the manner I am today, reflects on my mother. I\u2019ve seen other people grow up and not have respect for human beings. But even though I play football, I\u2019m still able to talk to everyone on the estate. Whenever I go, I can literally talk to anyone that I meet and everyone I have known from my past. It is normal, I casually get on with it.\u201d Bolasie has designed a customised pair of boots that chart his journey, from his mum\u2019s house to Wembley, which he wore during the warm-up before Palace\u2019s 2-1 semi-final victory over Watford. \u201cOn one side of the boot it had the journey from my mum\u2019s house to Wembley,\u201d he says. \u201cThe road map is highlighted in blue and obviously you can see the green and stuff, and on the other side of the boot it had the Wembley arch, what I could see from my mum\u2019s bedroom, with a Palace flag on it and the Palace fans walking to Wembley. \u201cPalace offered me the opportunity to come and play and I took it with both hands. For me, at the time [of signing in 2012], I didn\u2019t care about what money I was getting or whatever it was going on; I just wanted to play football because I knew playing games would make me improve, and I think looking back at my career at Palace every year I\u2019ve always improved and improved and added a lot more things to my game.\u201d Thousands of Palace fans will travel to Wembley expectant of a big performance from their side against a United team who have endured a trying season under Louis van Gaal, and had their Cup preparations disrupted by last Sunday\u2019s dummy bomb incident which led to the league fixture against Bournemouth being played on Tuesday. United missed out on a qualification place for next season\u2019s Champions League but, whereas the Europa League may not appeal to many at Old Trafford, for Palace such a prize would feel more significant. \u201cYou can\u2019t help yourself thinking about those kind of things,\u201d Bolasie says. \u201cThe main thing is that, if I get that opportunity, it would rub away the hurt that I got when I didn\u2019t play in the play-off final. Hopefully my mum will enjoy it and hopefully I can make it special.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
