Instead, the England winger dropped the ball, a brawl broke out at the next scrum and two hookers were shown the yellow card, leaving Northampton with 13 \u2013 Courtney Lawes was already in the cooler \u2013 against the Cardiff Blues' 14. Chris Czekaj then burst out of defence, going round Paul Diggin and taking his team to within a few metres of a try and a losing bonus point. Not only did this make the conclusion a touch tatty for the victors, but it also set the stage for round two of this back-to-back encounter. The element of spice was only made sharper when Gareth Williams and Dylan Hartley, the offending hookers, failed to, as they say, let it go and continued to wave fingers at each other to the very end. Next Sunday could be one to follow. It certainly removed any sense of the routine from the game. Not that it had much of the conventional about it from the very start. For instance, as long as they could avoid lineouts and scrums, which amounted to an ambitious stab at continuity, the Blues had the run of the field. They were neat and crisp on the ball and full of endeavour to offer the ball carrier an option both on his inside and out. Northampton seemed quite happy to oblige in this guinea-pig game of no set-piece, pushing prematurely twice when the referee did call for a scrummage. When it dawned on them that this was not a productive approach they opted instead to steal two throws and worked their way to the corner, where they tried to make up for lost time by pounding the Blues at five scrums in quick succession. From the last, Roger Wilson flipped a pass the Ryan Powell, and the scrum-half released Paul Diggin from short range on the blind side. The nonsense was over; the scrum was back. The trouble for the home team was that there was now a scrappiness to their play between the rigid structures of scrum and lineout. They might have thought they were giving away penalties from a long way out, but it mattered not to Dan Parks, and he banged over every chance he had until he ran out of muscle at 55 metres in the second half. One penalty conceded by Lawes was for diving into a ruck, not the first time the new sensation of the England game has been caught doing that. Another could have been even more costly, a high tackle by James Downey on Tom James resulting in a yellow card for the centre. The Blues were unable to take advantage, however, since in the next movement Tau Filise was sent to the sin-bin for dipping a hand into a ruck. The game turned at the start of the second half. Paul Tito gathered the kick-off, only to hesitate with his delivery. Northampton pounced on the ball and Ashton was on hand to finish a clinical punishment. The rest of the game was about how much embarrassment Lawes and Christian Day could inflict on the Blues lineout. Quite a lot as it turned out. As the possession statistics piled up in their favour the home forwards could simply applaud Myler and Jon Clarke for kicking the ball over the heads of the Cardiff backs and into touch. Nothing more complex was required, since Myler also landed two more penalties to make the game safe for Northampton and keep them clear by three points at the top of their pool. But then came the yellow for Lawes and a penalty for Parks, followed shortly by the hot spot at the death. There was no danger of Northampton losing the game, but it served to reinforce the link between these Heineken Cup games. As Hartley and Williams seemed to be saying to each other, this isn't over yet.
