Wow, even \u2018Gibbo\u2019 is lying to us now", "bodyText": "I wanted to send my dad in to cover this column instead, but for various reasons (chief among them being my editors threatening to change my byline photo to an ice cube melting on a keyboard) we are here, now, together, so I guess I\u2019d better get on with it. Anyway, topline: the Queen is not dead, the usually infallible Gibbo was wrong. We should at least tee up the fact that the \u201cQueen is dead\u201d hoax is now an annual winter tradition, the freezing foil to Glastonbury\u2019s summer high. The temperatures plunge, frost creeps over the pavements, fat squirrels hibernate up high away from the range of Jo Swinson\u2019s sniper scope and, at some point between November and February, speculation bubbles up that the monarch might have died and the palace is just keeping it \u201chush hush\u201d, waiting for a more auspicious moment to announce it. Given that this is a country that once speedballed to death its own king to make it easier for the morning papers to report the news, it\u2019s not the most \u201cout there\u201d of claims. But where to start with a story that begins with the rigid, cold corpse of the Queen and ends zoomed in on the grainily photographed tip of a penis? On Sunday, a screenshot went viral of a WhatsApp group chat called \u201cOld times\u201d where a nameless source known only as \u201cGibbo\u201d (America had \u201cDeep Throat\u201d, we have a man who sounds like he\u2019s banned from his local Spar for riding a BMX down the cider aisle) forwarded the messages: \u201cQueens passed away this morning, heart attack, being announced 930 Am tomorrow, channel dash 0800 tomorrow in full number 1s, in your black kit bag you need : 1 set of 3s 1 set of 4s Under and socks for two weeks Washing kit Body washing kit Cities fornstand down\u201d. I feel so nerdy before I write this next line that I\u2019m taking a huge honk of inhaler and asking my form tutor if me and the boys can form Warhammer club so we don\u2019t have to go outside during break time: but why would Gibbo use both regular time (930 Am) and military time (0800) when breaking the news? Yeah, exactly. That and the Queen not being announced as dead proves once and for all that this cannot be real. But then, during an election campaign, on a quiet Sunday night, does it matter whether the Queen is dead or not? Or would we rather spend 14 hours speculating about why the troops would be asked to pack two weeks of underwear and only two sets of clothes? The answer to both is \u201cyes\u201d. Enormous, country-altering news stories can\u2019t help but alter election coverage, suspend campaigning. No disrespect, Ma\u2019am, but it would be really inconvenient for you to die just now. This election is just getting good. The fallout, though, is the most delicious bit. As everyone online analysed the WhatsApp screenshot, the blue-ticks starting speculating about how absurd it would be that the Queen would ever die. \u201cI see we have reached that time of year where I have to dispel rumours of HM\u2019s passing,\u201d said Royal Central editor Charlie Proctor, as if he has to go through this with someone every other day. \u201cThe Queen is not dead. She is alive &amp; well and is very much looking forward to hosting President Trump and other world leaders at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday for the NATO reception.\u201d Andrew Lilico tweeted with the cool, calm tone you would expect from Brexit\u2019s favoured economist in the event of the Queen dying, saying: \u201cAre people falsely claiming the Queen is dead? Isn\u2019t that High Treason? Do you all assume your judges will have a sense of humour?\u201d And as we all head directly to jail without passing Go for saying the Queen is dead, the final payoff: there, lurking in plain sight all along, the group icon if you zoom in and squint: a stiff, saluting, dimly-lit little chode. I would like to imagine, for a moment, what it would like to be the owner of that penis: inextricably linked now to the death of the Queen, having your meat pored over by Westminster-leaning newsrooms across the country, probably being analysed by supercomputers in Russia and China and, if we\u2019re very honest, being downloaded and enhanced, pixel-by-pixel, deep in the bowels of MI5. Has an innocent dick pic ever caused such an international fracas? Did the person who first sent it, one throwaway horny night, know that their dick might kill the Queen? Please, Gibbo, I\u2019m begging you, whoever you are: get in touch and let me know. Universally dreaded I know bullying isn\u2019t \u201cgrownup\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d, but I am quite enjoying the mass rejection of Iain Duncan Smith by the people of Chingford and Woodford Green. It\u2019s a multi-narrator story arc that paints him as a lowly tragic bald spectre, bearing his teeth in dark doorways and pitiably handing out his flyers to those who hate him and getting his dark little heart crushed in return. This particular photo by Will Goring \u2013 him, smiling with glee, Iain Duncan Smith, cowed and pathetic and doing the \u201ccome on mate don\u2019t take a photo of me when I\u2019m down on my arse\u201d arm gesture to camera \u2013 is in my eyes a work of modern art, and that\u2019s without the apocryphal Facebook post doing the rounds. \u201c\u2018Please take this leaflet back. I don\u2019t want it,\u2019\u201d the anonymous Facebook author says to a door-stopper who slipped an IDS flyer through their door. \u201cAnd he says: \u2018I didn\u2019t put that through your door.\u2019 And I say: \u2018You clearly did, you have a pile of them in your hands. Can\u2019t you see the Labour poster in my window?\u2019 [\u2026] And you look up at him. And it\u2019s Iain Duncan Smith himself.\u201d If this is genuine, it means even Iain Duncan Smith is ashamed to endorse Iain Duncan Smith. And, really, could you blame him? Centrist cad Not like the Liberal Democrats to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, but they\u2019ve somehow managed it again: in an innocuous tweet sent on Monday morning, Lib Dem HQ tweeted photos of Hollywood brake light operator Hugh Grant alongside its Finchley and Golders Green candidate Luciana Berger. \u201cSo great to see Hugh Grant supporting @lucianaberger over the weekend,\u201d it went, alongside a beaming photo of the pair, before stating: \u201cOnly the Lib Dems can take seats off the Tories \u2013 and together we can stop Boris and #StopBrexit.\u201d Grant, who hasn\u2019t aligned himself with one particular party, rather endorsing a tactical anti-Tory voting block, replied spectacularly with: \u201cYour second para is not true.\u201d The party had its celebrity endorsement, and then it \u201cdid a tuition fees\u201d on it, and now it doesn\u2019t. A lesson as old as time itself: put out a rake and the Lib Dems will always find a way to step on it. \u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
