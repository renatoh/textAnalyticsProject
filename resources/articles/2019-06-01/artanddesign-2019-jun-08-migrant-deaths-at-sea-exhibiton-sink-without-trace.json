He was working on a project in Mali when he met a young man named Alpha, who told him about a grave he\u2019d seen in the desert of a girl from his native Cameroon. Alpha wondered if her parents and siblings knew she was there, adding that this scared him more than death itself: the idea of being buried alone in a graveyard where no one could mourn him. The project began in earnest in 2015, when Hirzel started touring cemeteries in Sicily to photograph migrants\u2019 graves. Then, on 18 April, the deadliest modern shipwreck in the Mediterranean happened: a vessel carrying between 700 and 1,100 people sank between Libya and Italy; only 28 survived. Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister at the time, vowed to salvage the ship in an effort to identify the bodies and give them a proper burial, and the vessel \u2013 now known as \u201cthe boat of innocents\u201d \u2013 was pulled to the surface in June 2016. The bodies on board were taken to a Nato base in Melilli, Sicily, where forensic doctors performed autopsies; further testing was done at the Labanof laboratory in Milan by a team of pathologists, many of them very young, led by Dr Cristina Cattaneo. The lengthy and laborious process involved cataloguing objects and documents found on the victims, and, where possible, comparing post-mortem samples with items provided by the families. Hirzel documented this process and others like it in his series Migrant Bodies. \u201cIn Italy, there\u2019s no standard protocol for dealing with bodies recovered at sea \u2013 the judicial authorities at local level make their own arrangements,\u201d he says. \u201cThis kind of work is done very rarely.\u201d Renzi\u2019s decision to recover the boat was controversial, with critics questioning the \u20ac9.5m spent. Hirzel wanted to show the value of these efforts: the series felt like a duty, he says, to victims and their families. As part of the project, Hirzel travelled to Senegal, where he met the family of Mamadou; he had been missing for two years and is thought to have been one of the victims of the 18 April sinking. \u201cPeople in Italy say: \u2018Why should we spend all this money when no one is looking for them?\u2019\u201d says Hirzel. \u201cBut Mamadou\u2019s family had been looking for him, in their own way: his brothers visited holy men in Gambia and Senegal to find out what had happened to him. Everybody is waiting.\u201d Red Cross psychologist Miriam Orteiza said to Hirzel: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for families to face their grief until there\u2019s a body, until there is certainty. This is why it\u2019s important.\u201d In Syracuse, Sicily, police officer Angelo Milazzo spent months working on the case of a migrant shipwreck that occurred in August 2014. He set up a Facebook page to share material with families, and eventually identified 23 out of 24 bodies. \u201cOne of these was Bilal,\u201d says Hirzel, \u201cthe 16-year-old brother of Mohamed Matok. Angelo and Mohamed spoke for years over email and Whatsapp, using Google Translate, and they became friends.\u201d Matok obtained a visa to come from Damascus to pray over his brother\u2019s grave; Hirzel photographed the visit. \u201cWhen he met Angelo at the airport they embraced, and Mohamed said to me: \u2018Angelo is an angel. Knowing where my brother is, being able to pick up his belongings \u2013 what he did for me was so important.\u2019\u201d Hirzel\u2019s photographs will be on show at Sink Without Trace, the first UK exhibition to focus specifically on the more than 30,000 migrants who have drowned in the Mediterranean over the past 30 years. It will feature work from 18 artists from 10 countries, including seven who migrated by sea as refugees. \u201cIt\u2019s a subject that\u2019s hardly dealt with in galleries here,\u201d says artist Maya Ramsay, who curated the exhibition with Federica Mazzara, senior lecturer at the University of Westminster. \u201cPart of me wonders whether it\u2019s partly to do with a sense of culpability, that we\u2019re not doing anything about the subject, that we\u2019re partly responsible. It\u2019s a really difficult subject. It\u2019s not easy for anybody \u2013 not for the artists or the viewers.\u201d Apart from raising money for rescue charity AlarmPhone, Ramsay hopes \u201cpeople will be inspired to do something\u201d. The show will provide a counterpoint to the controversial Barca Nostra (Our Boat), in which a team led by Christoph B\u00fcchel, a Swiss-Icelandic artist, exhibited the recovered \u201cboat of innocents\u201d \u2013 the same boat that the bulk of Hirzel\u2019s project focuses on \u2013 at this year\u2019s Venice Biennale. \u201cPutting the boat on display without any background context is not what I would have done,\u201d says Ramsay. \u201cI find it a lost opportunity for telling people more about what happened \u2013 and what does still happen for lots of boats.\u201d Hirzel feels similarly: \u201cWhen you pass from information to a form of celebration, there\u2019s a risk that it becomes a monument of sorts to European compassion: so that we can feel sympathetic, getting emotional in front of this boat. But the next day, 40 people died at sea. I feel the artist acted in good faith but, considering the situation, if I was a survivor or a family member watching Europeans take selfies with that boat\u2026 I\u2019d be annoyed.\u201d Reminding Europe of its responsibility is central to Hirzel\u2019s work. \u201cWe should be ashamed. We\u2019re hypocrites \u2013 talking about human rights, calling it \u2018the boat of innocents\u2019. But if they had survived we would have called it \u2018the boat of illegal immigrants\u2019. They\u2019re just doing what people have done for all of humanity \u2013 when they need to, they move. For me this can never be illegal. We treat these events as if they were natural disasters, but it\u2019s not normal for kids aged 22 or 23 to be conducting autopsies on bodies the same age as them, in these quantities. I feel like if there had been a will to resolve this we would have found a way by now.\u201d Hirzel hopes his images will act as testimony. \u201cMaybe one day these photos will be used to assess our current societies. At least no one will be able to say they didn\u2019t know what was happening \u2013 this is proof.\u201d Death, he adds, is something that connects us all. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of coverage of migration, but this is an angle that touches us as humans. Grief, death \u2013 this is something we all have in common.\u201d Sink Without Trace will be at P21 gallery, London NW1, from 13 June to 13 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
