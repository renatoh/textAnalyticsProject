Several face prosecution in a separate, and more serious, case. But yesterday's rulings left international investors and analysts still waiting for a guarantee that the Italian authorities are ready to respond to huge embezzlement with severe deterrents. The Parmalat scandal revealed gaping holes in Italy's corporate governance regulations and prompted talk of an \"Italy risk\" for unwary foreign investors. One of the prosecutors involved in the Milan case said that yesterday's verdicts would enable him and his colleagues to pursue charges against leading Italian and foreign banks. The banks are suspected of marketing Parmalat bonds to investors even though they were aware the food group was heading for the rocks. \"By the end of July, we should be able to formally request a trial for the banks,\" said the prosecutor, Francesco Greco. The scandal broke in late 2003 when it emerged that Parmalat funds totalling almost \u20ac4bn (\u00a32.7bn) that were meant to be held in an account at Bank of America did not exist. It subsequently became clear the group's debts came to more than \u20ac14bn - eight times what had been stated. The heaviest sentence handed down yesterday, of two and a half years, was given to Parmalat's former chief financial officer, Fausto Tonna, who was accused of weaving a web of offshore subsidiaries to disguise the group's true cashflow. Legal sources said Mr Tonna, who spent several months remanded in detention, would probably have his jail sentence altered to community service. They said the same was likely to apply to Gian Paolo Zini, a lawyer who was sentenced to two years. All the other defendants benefited from a provision in Italian law that waives jail for first-time offenders sentenced to less than two years. They included two other former chief financial officers, internal auditors and a brother and son of Parmalat's founder, Calisto Tanzi. Among the charges were market rigging and obstructing the work of the market regulator. Mr Tanzi had offered to plea bargain on the same charges but on Saturday the judge ordered him to stand trial alongside 15 other people. They include former executives of Parmalat, and of the Italian branches of Bank of America, and the auditing firms of Deloitte &amp; Touche and Grant Thornton. Bank of America and Deloitte &amp; Touche have both denied wrongdoing. Grant Thornton severed its links with its Italian arm after Parmalat's collapse. Prosecutors in Parma, the city renowned for its high quality foods, from which the group took its name, are pursuing a separate inquiry into more serious accusations including fraudulent bankruptcy. The Parma prosecutors have yet to seek indictments. Creditors of the collapsed firm have until August to vote on a plan devised by the administrator to relist Parmalat and give them access to a \u20ac12bn debt-for-equity swap."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
