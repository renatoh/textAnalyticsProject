After weeks of negotiating a fee for the scorer of one of the finest own goals you\u2019ll ever see, they\u2019ve finally done it. Ed Woodward has finally done it! He really has! Hooray for Ed! They\u2019ll be building a statue of him outside Old Trafford any day now! Forget the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand \u2013 how about the Sir Ed Woodward Stand? It has a nice ring to it. Except \u2026 hang on \u2026 hang on a minute \u2026 look here \u2026 oh \u2026 it says here \u2026 \u201ccontrary to earlier reports\u201d \u2026 oh \u2026 oh dear \u2026 Manchester United and Crystal Palace haven\u2019t agreed a \u00a355m fee for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Oh. Oh dear. Oh Ed. Cancel the statue. Unless, of course, United manage to complete a deal for Bournemouth\u2019s wispy genius David Brooks. Plus they\u2019ve found an alternative to Wan-Bissaka. Only, Norwich City have said that their prodigy Max Aarons is going nowhere. Similarly, West Ham have told United to go away and stop asking them about Issa Diop and Declan Rice. Ask me again, Manuel Pellegrini has said, and I\u2019ll develop an interest in Marcus Rashford. See how you like it. Plans are afoot to end Neymar\u2019s two-year sabbatical from football. The Brazilian has been looking at houses in Barcelona, but he could yet be heading to Real Madrid. Zinedine Zidane\u2019s side are said to have offered Paris Saint-Germain \u00a3115m for the forward and are ready to lob Gareth Bale and James Rodr\u00edguez into the deal as an added treat. However, Madrid will have to be quick if they want to sign Paul Pogba. Juventus remain ahead of them in the race to prise the midfielder away from United. Jorginho is going to follow Maurizio Sarri to Juventus and leave Chelsea for \u00a350m. Phew. That means N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 can get back in his proper position, meaning Proper Football Men everywhere can relax. Arsenal are after Celtic full-back Kieran Tierney, Saint-Etienne\u2019s William Saliba and Red Bull Salzburg\u2019s Dominik Szoboszlai, while they are set to sell David Ospina to Napoli for \u00a34m and could let Carl Jenkinson join West Brom. Tom Heaton has rejected a new contract at Burnley and is set to leave Turf Moor on a free. Newcastle\u2019s Mo Diam\u00e9 is expected to join Al-Gharafa in Qatar when his contract runs out at the end of the month. Sheffield United, Aston Villa and West Brom are fighting over Blackburn\u2019s Bradley Dack. Internazionale and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid want Southampton\u2019s Ryan Bertrand. Lower those eyebrows.
