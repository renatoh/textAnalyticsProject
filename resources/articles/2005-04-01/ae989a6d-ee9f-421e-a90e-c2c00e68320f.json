Mr Vanunu, who has been barred from leaving the country since he was released from prison last year, must remain in the country until at least April 19 2006, said Gilad Heiman, a spokesman for the interior minister, Ophir Pines-Paz. Mr Vanunu, a former technician at Israel's nuclear plant in the southern town of Dimona, was released in April 2004 after serving 18 years for divulging information about Israel's atomic programme to a British newspaper. He went on trial last week for allegedly violating the terms of his release, which also includes a ban on contact with foreigners. At the hearing, prosecutors accused him of giving interviews to foreign media. Israeli security officials have said Mr Vanunu could still possess classified information that he had not released. Based on this assessment, prosecutors asked for the restrictions to be extended. Mr Vanunu has repeatedly said he has no more secrets to divulge. A convert to Christianity, he has said he wants to move to the US. Last week Norway rejected his asylum request. Mr Vanunu was arrested in 1986 and convicted two years later for divulging information and pictures of the Dimona reactor. The details, published in the Sunday Times, led experts to conclude that Israel has the world's sixth-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, including hundreds of warheads. Israel neither acknowledges nor denies having a nuclear weapons programme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
