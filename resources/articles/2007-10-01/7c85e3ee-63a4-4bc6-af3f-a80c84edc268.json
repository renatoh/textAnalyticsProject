The public messages were both aimed at Washington, which always goes down well in both Tehran and Moscow. Attending a summit of nations bordering the Caspian Sea, Mr Putin secured a declaration warning \"outside countries\" against using their territories around the Caspian as a launchpad for military action. This refers to a rumour that the US might be planning to use Azerbaijan as a base for striking Iran. As the US has carrier groups in the Gulf, innumerable bases in Iraq and a major base in Afghanistan with which to strike Iran, the rumour is just that. The second pronouncement was equally rhetorical. It said that pipelines could only cross the Caspian with the permission of all five countries that share the shoreline. This was an attempt to block a western plan to deliver oil from central Asia, bypassing Russia. The private messages that Mr Putin delivered to the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the supreme leader Ali Khamenei were more nuanced. Mr Putin said last week he saw no \"objective data\" that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons, but he is still trying to negotiate Tehran's compliance with a UN security council resolution to suspend uranium enrichment. Mr Putin is no less canny in his bilateral dealings with the Islamic Republic. Russia has built a nuclear power plant in the southern port of Bushehr, but refuses to ship the fuel for the plant, claiming payment arrears for the contract. The reactor was due to go on line this autumn, but is now being delayed indefinitely. Last night he pointedly refused to set a date for the startup. Mr Putin is unlikely to accede to Tehran's wishes easily, because Russia has more to gain from acting as the honest broker than it has from siding with Iran. Mr Putin also revealed what he termed a \"certain transformation\" of the US position on missile defence, after the talks he held at the end of last week with the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, and the defence secretary, Robert Gates. It could be that after years of cold peace rhetoric in which Russia has re-established its image abroad as a power - even if it is only one which wields vetoes - Mr Putin is rediscovering the international benefits of dialogue. Thus far, Russian foreign policy has done a very good job of uniting the opposition to Moscow. But even an oil- and gas-rich nation needs friends, and at some point Russia will feel the need to court strategic alliances with the west again. When it does, many of its current policies will have to change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
