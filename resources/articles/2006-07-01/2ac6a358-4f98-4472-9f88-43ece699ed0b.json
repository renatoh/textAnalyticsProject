The potential is greater now in the age of the new media than it was when I started 50 years ago. Many of the complaints I deal with are concerned with journalism that does not do that but has the effect of reinforcing prejudice, often by the tedious repetition of stereotypical views. Let us take age and ageism. In newspapers the latter is perhaps related to an endemic obsession with the former. An obsession with age? In a report about the death of a witness in the so-called NatWest Three case, the Guardian included an interview with a neighbour of the man and, in quoting her view of him, noted that she was 37. In what scale of values is that a relevant piece of information? In this case it is simply the working of a journalistic reflex. To come closer to the point, earlier this year the paper started a report of the rescue of two transatlantic sailors with the statement: \"Most retired people are content to fill their days doting on grandchildren, creating their ideal garden, and taking relaxing holidays\" - perhaps a pity when the headline was an irreproachable: \"Couple rescued after attempt to sail Atlantic fails.\" She was 68 at the time; he was 64. A reader wrote: \"Had the couple been under 25, would the lead have been 'Most young people are content to fill their days drinking themselves senseless, watching crap TV, and shagging as much as possible ... ' \" She suggested an alternative introduction: \"Exemplifying the growing trend for people to take up new challenges in later life ... \" Occasionally the Guardian gets it very wrong, although one of the most recent examples that understandably drew strong complaint from several readers was in the advertising and not the editorial columns. It was a related pair of advertisements. The first showed a grey-haired (and possibly blind) woman at the window of a car, the driver of which had stopped to ask the way. The copy read, \"Want directions you can trust? Turn the page.\" Over the page was an advertisement for a satellite navigation system. The Guardian advertising executive who responded to the complainants concedes that they did have a point. The advertisements were not scheduled to appear again. On the other hand, when in March the Guardian cartoonist Steve Bell caricatured the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell, as a toothless chicken (?) at a walking frame, no one complained. Sir Menzies Campbell, by the way, is a mere 65. Sometimes the paper gets it almost startlingly right. Several newspapers carried a story about a 92-year-old woman who was shown abseiling down a 220ft tower block. In the Daily Mirror she was Danger Gran. In the Sun she was Action Nan. In the Guardian the heading simply said: \"Tower of strength - abseiling at 92 from office block.\" In The Long History of Old Age, the editor Pat Thane, commenting on the pressures that have brought about changes in the generally acceptable terminology relating to older people, writes: \"Such changes were driven by perceptions of the disparities between a language which constructed people above a certain age as helpless and dependent and the visible reality that increasing numbers of them were not.\" In Ageing Societies (details below), the author, Sarah Harper, the director of the Oxford Institute of Ageing at the University of Oxford, writes: \"By 2030 half the population of western Europe will be aged over 50, with a predicted average life expectancy at age 50 of a further 40 years, that is half western Europe's population will be between 50 and 100 years.\" She also notes: \"The group aged 80 years and over is the fastest growing age group in the world with an annual growth rate of 3.9%.\" I enter my eighth decade tomorrow.
