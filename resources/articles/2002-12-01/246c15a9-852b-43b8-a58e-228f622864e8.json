At least it was an interesting match to watch (and hopefully, for you dear readers - to read). Most importantly I never had to eat that platter of pie that was advancing towards my gullet around and about the Ameobi goal stage. It would have played havoc with last night's staff party induced torrid tummy. 90 mins Newcastle are still pushing forward, too much in Ameobi's case who endeavours to crawl his way past Puyol in the box, and is yellow carded. 30 seconds left, and Barca are slowing things down...down.. down, and then the whistle goes. Saviola's nickname is actually Conejito, which means little rabbit - check out his front teeth and you'll see why, says Alicia de Rado. That'll put pay to me believing everything I hear on TV. 87 mins Yes, I realise that dippy is hardly football parlance, but that's the way I saw it. 84 mins Two attempts on goal. Puyol tries to curl it round the post, and it goes wide, leaving him pulling out his unkempt shaggy mop. Then a much neater -he is Dutch - Overmars kicks the ball straight at Given from a dippy clearance from the afore mentioned goalie. 80 mins Andy Griffin goes down with Marc Overmars and takes the ball with him, picking it up and rolls over with it like he was trying to hump it or something. Unsurprisingly the ref says it was a hand-ball and gives a free-kick, which Overmars doesn't hang about for. Newcastle are almost 4-1 down, but Riquelme tries to take it on his right instead of caning it with his left, and Given does his job. 77 mins Corner for Robert to take. Gary Speed, is he covered in blood or mud, gets his head to it and it goes over the crossbar. Substitution, Saviola - the little witch, isn't that Veron? - comes on in place of Dani, the scorer of the first goal. 75 mins Real Madrid have equalised. Robert just skuffed a decent volleying chance, take that back, he didn't even make contact with the ball, much to everyone's delight. It came about courtesy of some persistent runing ftom Solano and Ameobi. 71 mins Ameobi had a chance at one end, he's been great tonight, and then Given does just enough at the other end to put off a rampaging Patrick Kluivert. Real Madrid are behind to Locomotiv Moscow? 2-1 down. Eh? Camp Nou is actually visibly shaking. 67 mins Meandering along the South coast, it ain't Brighton, it ain't Plymouth and lordy knows it isn't Southampton. Dan and Sooz Langford, I doff my cap. Portsmouth. Do we know each other, I wonder, there's not that many Anjana's around. 65 mins Robert free-kick. Guess where it goes. Cart Cort and Jermain Jenas warming up. Take off Robert I say. 61 mins Did I tell you that Ruudboy scored at Old Trafford? 2-0. And during another corner, Kieron Dyer unbelievably re-enacts his James Dean pose against the post, casually slouching, fag in mouth, ladies on arm, brylcreem on stubbly head, you know what I mean. Luckily, the corner was mild, not wild. 57 mins GOAL! 3-1. Thiago Motta jumps the highest. Theres a kerfuffle as to whether the ball crossed the line before rebounding off Kieron Dyer, who would have prevented the goal, had he been standing on the line instead of a foot behind it. But the flag's gone up, Dyer wakes up and looks sheepish, Sir Bob looks cheesed off and the Barca fans look like they haven't a care in the world. (B&gt;55 mins Corner for Newcastle. Taken by Solano. Juan Roman Riquelme's goal line clearance from Ameobi's header. Overmars on the break. Andy Griffin, he's ubiquitous - tackles. Move over. 52 mins Gary Speed blocks a Mendieta shot. Corner. Flapped away by Given, literally, handbag and feather boa and all. Dani mucks up the follow up in quite spectacular-worthy-of-a-Lauren-Robert-reference style. 48 mins Something made me laugh - Robert's second row n with the squiggle goal attempt, and something made me go aaah - the crowd bursting into spontaneous applause when Sir Bobby's face was beamed out on the big screen. Is there anyone that doesn't love that man? And what a gamut of emotionsfor me to run in such a short space of time. 46 mins Some facts that I plagarised off the telly, Newcastle have never lost a match when Ameobi has scored, and Barca, despite their poor league form have not lost at the Nou Camp. yet this season. One of these situaions has to change. Also if you have been reading the papers you will know that Barca are not allowed to play two matches at the Camp because of the pig's head throwing incidents against Real Madrid, and more specifically, Luis Figo a couple of weeks ago. Half-time stillRottenham Neil Jackman? Where that? Rotherham, no, Rotterdam, no. Rottenham, certainly not. There's no airport in the city which I follow. How's that for a double-edged clue. Let's get back to the football. Still half-time Still 1 - 0 at Old Trafford, but I guess you already knew that. Ruudboy should have got a couple more, and plenty of room for improvement generally. Juventus 3 - 0 Basle if you're Italian, Swiss, or just interested. Half-time Not Spurs, not Man U, not Sunderland, not Leeds. With Dover, Jason Waddington, you are getting slightly warmer. 46 mins Newcastle are still in the game as the whistle goes for half-time. And I'm not back tracking on my earlier comment because I really did believe that Newcastle would be taken apart quickly and without trace of remorse of sympathy for Sir Bob. But thankfully that hasn't been the case and they are more than acquitting themselves. 43mins All the pressure is on Andys O'Brien and Griffin. From another darting run and clever pass, this time by Puyol on the right, O'Brien has to make another valiant clearance, but the ball only goes as far as Xavi. He tries to chip the ball through for Dani, but no to avail. 2 minutes added on. In reply at the other end, Laurent Robert hits the ball into row n with the squiggle on top. 40 mins Newcastle look like they could score any minute, then again so do Barcelona. And no, Sandip Sukhtanker, I'm not Dan Rookwood under a pseudonym, unless I'm very well disguised. I'm far too untrendy to emulate my world renowned work mate. 35 mins GOAL! 2-1 Patrick Kluivert, I think this makes him top scorer in the Champions League level with Alessandro del Piero. I'm sorry but I didn't actually see the goal because the computer crashed, and Barry Glendenning had to come and sort it out, in his swash-buckling heroic style. I'll have a good look at it at half-time. Promise. 31 mins Great run from Kieron Dyer down the right hand side. He rounds the last line of defence and tries to cut the ball across the face of goal to Ameobi. It goes out for Newcastle's first corner. From which nothing happens, but it's funny playing spot which player Mandieta is trying to mark. He's lost the plot. 27 mins Overmars is taking liberties with Andy Griffin's legs. Over and over again. Andy O'Brien has been forced to come across more than once to plaster over the leak on the left. Oh and just a minute after the goal, Overmars had a stonking shot saved by Shay Given. 23 mins GOAL! 1-1 Mama's in the kitchen baking up a slice of good ol' humble pie as we speak. Kieron Dyer held the ball up and spread it out to Shola Ameobi, who was totally unmarked by Mendieta (who had done a runner after Solano - wrong player), and slides the ball in. All too easily, and all too eerily the Nou Camp goes suddenly quiet. 19 mins In reply to Simon W Thomas, I'm not a Liverpool supporter actually, unlike most of my misguided colleagues. Bet you can't guess who I do support, but I'll give you a clue, we're not likely be going to Europe for anything other than cheap booze and fags or the Intertoto for the foreseeable future. 13 mins Cocu has gone off to be replaced by Mendieta. Not a bad ace to have up your sleeve, although he's lost some form since impressing in the World Cup. But Barca as a team hardly live up to their reputation at the moment, even looking likely to end up down in the bottom half of La Liga should results carry on as they are. 13 mins In typical Newcastle style, they are keeping up the offensive pressure. LuaLua has twice crossed the ball in from deep to Shola Ameobi, and the Barca defence have had to make good headed interceptions. One of the interceptors, Reiziger, has had to go off on a milk cart due to a pulled hamstring. 10 mins Lauren Robert almost assisted Nol Solano an easy goal by skinning Michael Reiziger and crossing the ball off the goalie Roberto Bonano,. Unfortunately the contact sent the ball skidding at a bad angle for Solano to convert. 6 mins GOAL! 1-0 Dani scores form a fantastic ball om from Xavi. At full stretch, he gets his foot to it in front of Aaron Hughes and pokes it neatly past Given. It all stemmed from Newcastle's inability to clear the ball effectively from corners - of which there have been many. Ruud van Nistelrooy has scored for Man United at Old Trafford, to make the news that bit more cheery for Newcastle fans. 3 mins Barca are pressuring already. Marc Overmars has twice made funnels through the back four with his pace and put Kluivert through. Newcastle were lucky that he couldn't make clean contact on the ball. Then again, he comes flying down the wing and Andy O'Brien has to make a tackle which leads to the third corner in 4 minutes. Nought results. 1 min First corner of the game for Barca,. there are 5 players in the box. It goes out for another corner, which Cocu gets a foot to. Up and over. Lots of shirt pulling on Frank de Boer too. Match pre-mortem: In the absence of the suspended Bellamy and Shearer, Shola Ameobi and Lomano LuaLua get their chances up front. For Barca, Dani will be partnering Patrick Kluivert upfront. The pitch is thankfully dry enough after last night's downpourings, and there are still a few Newcastle fans that phoned in sick back home to stay an extra day for the match. And you would wouldn't you? Absent are those who were bussed back last night without being told the match had been re-arranged, they might be reading this. If so, I won't give my pre-match opinion which is that Newcastle will be soundly shafted. Let's see if I can have some humble pie later.
