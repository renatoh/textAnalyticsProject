Now they have turned out a mellow film in which Himesh Patel is a singer who \u2013 after some weird storm \u2013 is the only person who remembers the Beatles. Gentle fun ensues. In Fabric (15) (Peter Strickland, 2018, UK) 119 mins Peter Strickland has carved out a reputation by excavating the intersection of campy horror and fetishist desire, with a nod to the Italian directors of the 60s and 70s who pioneered it. His new one stars Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Hayley Squires and Gwendoline Christie, and features a haunted dress that unleashes gruesomeness on anyone who wears it. Apollo 11 (U) (Todd Douglas Miller, 2018, US) 93 mins The 1969 moon landings remain the apogee of American technological accomplishment, although one that is rapidly receding in the rear-view mirror. This 50th-anniversary doc tells the story Senna style (all archive footage, no talking heads), reminding us what an achievement it was. It is worth seeking out in the cinema, especially for the beautifully restored 70mm footage. Toy Story 4 (U) (Josh Cooley, 2019, US) 100 mins \u201cFranchise fatigue\u201d is a phrase on the film industry\u2019s mind, after the relative failures of Men in Black: International and X-Men: Dark Phoenix. Hollywood has not made up its mind about the fourth instalment of the much-loved Toy Story: the reviews have been good, not great, and box office has been fine. Do we need it? Possibly not, but it\u2019s a fun addition, and Forky is already a pop culture fixture. Support the Girls (15) (Andrew Bujalski, 2018, US) 88 mins Andrew Bujalski is the sometime mumblecore director renowned for his lo-fi relationship movies; so he is the natural person to take charge of a rousing empowerment fable about a put-upon woman running a Texas girlie bar called \u201cDouble Whammies\u201d. Bujalski, though, is good at making you care about Lisa (played by Regina Hall), who starts out crying in her car and then finds the problems piling up. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Janelle Mon\u00e1e Last year\u2019s concept-heavy Dirty Computer album may not have quite cemented Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s superstar status, but she is still a formidable live performer, fusing old-school triple-threat dynamism with forward-thinking production. Make sure you\u2019ve saved enough energy for main set closers and top-tier bangers Tightrope and Make Me Feel. London, Tuesday 2; Dublin, Wednesday 3; Manchester, Thursday 4 July Wireless festival Last October, Wireless festival announced that it\u2019d had its licence renewed (yay!), but only under the proviso that the acts curbed the swearing (WTF!?). It will be interesting to see how that is enforced, as Friday\u2019s headliner Cardi B (pictured) is one of the planet\u2019s best swearers. Others trying to keep it clean across the weekend include Migos, Ella Mai, A$AP Rocky and Future. Finsbury Park, N4, Friday 5 to 7 July C\u00e9line Dion Fashion icon. Comedian. Meme. C\u00e9line Dion has come along way since soundtracking Jack and Rose\u2019s boat-based shenanigans more than two decades ago. But in among all the cultural reappraisal, that gilded voice remains. Now she has finally left her Las Vegas enclave, this show is a rare chance for UK fans to wine-cry themselves hoarse to Dion\u2019s best song, It\u2019s All Coming Back to Me Now. Hyde Park, W2, Friday 5 July Doja Cat LA rapper and producer Amala Zandile Dlamini, AKA Doja Cat, has had a fairly surprising route to prominence. The daughter of two visual artists, her breakthrough came in 2018 when her single Mooo!, an absurdist, meme-ready novelty track in which she imagines being a cow, went viral. She\u2019s more serious now, but not much. London, Tuesday 2; Birmingham, Thursday 4; Manchester, Friday 5 July MC Andrew McCormack Graviton Like many beneficiaries of a Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors education, Andrew McCormack (pictured, right) crosses cultures, vaults technical hurdles, and stirs the mind and the feet. Showcasing new album The Calling, the pianist\u2019s prog rock-leaning Graviton band merge tight sax hooks, fast-moving improv, Noemi Nuti\u2019s acrobatic singing, and driving grooves from bassist Tom Herbert and drummer Joshua Blackmore. Whiskey Jar, Manchester, Monday 1; Flute and Tankard, Cardiff, Tuesday 2 July JF Three of the best ... classical concerts New music biennial The third edition of the Performing Rights Society\u2019s celebration of British composers follows the template of its predecessors. New works, none longer than 15 minutes and almost all specially commissioned, are performed across a long weekend by some of the UK\u2019s finest new-music groups. This time, the composers represented range from kora player Sona Jobarteh and performer-producer Forest Swords to pianist Rolf Hind and baritone Roderick Williams. Admission to all events is free, although tickets should be obtained in advance. Southbank Centre, SE1, Friday 5 to 7; various venues, Hull 12 to 14 July Cheltenham music festival It is the 75th Cheltenham music festival, and although it is no longer one of the most important new-music showcases in Britain, it pays lip service to its former status. For this year at least, trumpeter Alison Balsom is the artistic director, and among the scattering of premieres are new works by Judith Weir (Fri) and Anna Clyne (11 Jul), plus a trumpet concerto composed for Balsom by the 91-year-old Thea Musgrave (6 Jul). Various venues, Friday 5 to 14 July The Marriage of Figaro What seems, at first sight, a routine return for David McVicar\u2019s 2006 production is much more intriguing on closer inspection. For not only does the revival mark Christian Gerhaher\u2019s debut in the role of Figaro, but the part of the teenage Cherubino, which Mozart scored for a mezzo-soprano, being taken by a countertenor, Kangmin Justin Kim. It is a strange piece of casting, which seems to strip a layer from the opera\u2019s ambiguity; how it works remains to be seen. Royal Opera House, WC2, Saturday 29 June to 21 July AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Cut and Paste: 400 Years of Collage Collage as a modernist art technique was invented by Picasso and Braque when they stuck newspaper clippings on to their cubist paintings. But long before that, women were pasting images together on fans and screens. This exhibition tells the whole radical story, from the Renaissance to punk and beyond. Scottish National Gallery of Art, Edinburgh, Saturday 29 June to 27 October F\u00e9lix Vallotton This artist of enigmatic love scenes and eerily beautiful sunsets has a claim to be France\u2019s Edvard Munch. They both created pared-down prints and paintings that distil dark, fin-de-si\u00e8cle moods. Vallotton is, however, a lot more colourful than Munch. His mixture of Japanese abstraction and modern observation may be summer magic. Royal Academy of Arts, W1, Sunday 30 June to 29 September David Smith This great US sculptor started out as a splenetic anti-war satirist; his early works in the 1930s reveal a suffering mind. Smith went on to achieve the same leap in three dimensions as his contemporary Jackson Pollock in two: into the wild west of abstract art. He created a freewheeling visual language, and his heavy metal art has caused vibrations ever since, from 60s minimalism to Richard Serra\u2019s walls of steel. Yorkshire Sculpture Park, nr Wakefield, to 5 January Yorkshire Sculpture International This new festival uses the popularity of Yorkshire folk Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore to advertise the county as a global centre for modern sculpture. There are exhibitions across hill and dale (see David Smith, left) and a passion for embedding art in stuff. Wakefield\u2019s Hepworth gallery is showing artists including Wolfgang Laib, Jimmie Durham and Tau Lewis who keep faith with materials, however unexpected those may be. Various venues, Wakefield &amp; Leeds, to 29 September Ed Ruscha Known for his paintings of gas stations and the LA Strip, Ed Ruscha\u2019s vision seems utterly contemporary. Yet he is a connoisseur of art history. He recently showed with the Romantic landscape artist Thomas Cole and here responds to works by a much less well-known predecessor, Louis Michel Eilshemius. Ruscha seems to be trying to locate himself in the history of US art as an eccentric, maverick and evasive dreamer. Gagosian, Davies Street, W1, to 2 August JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows The End of History\u2026 Playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany are the duo behind that little-known show Harry Potter &amp; the Cursed Child. Despite said smash, they are innovative, indie theatre-makers at heart. Their latest collaboration tracks a fraught family reunion; a clash of heads, politics and ideals that stars top thesps Lesley Sharp and David Morrissey. Royal Court: Jerwood Theatre Downstairs, SW1, to 10 August Peter Gynt David Hare stages his 19th play at the National and it\u2019s a romcom. (Not really!) Hare has adapted one of Henrik Ibsen\u2019s most surreal works: James McArdle will play Peter Gynt, a man who steals a bride from a wedding then embarks on an epic journey, over mountains and across deserts. Jonathan Kent directs. National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, to 8 October Life of Pi Director Max Webster is such a pro at creating exuberantly entertaining children\u2019s theatre (see: The Lorax at London\u2019s Old Vic). So there are high hopes for his production of Yann Martel\u2019s Life of Pi, which Lolita Chakrabarti has adapted for the stage. The play is a coming-of-age tale about a young boy stranded on a boat at sea, with only animals \u2013 including a hungry tiger \u2013 for company. Expect fresh storytelling and spellbinding puppetry. Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, to 20 July Noises Off Is this the funniest farce ever? Yes. Yes it is. Michael Frayn\u2019s classic returns to the Lyric, after it premiered here in 1982. It is a gem of a comedy set backstage at the theatre, where everything is on the verge of a gloriously catastrophic meltdown. Jeremy Herrin directs a cast led by Meera Syal. This truly is comedy gold, and a heartfelt love letter to the mad chaos that is a life spent working in theatre. Lyric Hammersmith, W6, to 27 July Measure for Measure Artistic director Gregory Doran directs one of the Bard\u2019s most chilling plays. It is set in a Vienna, a city on the verge of moral collapse. When the Duke abdicates, icy cruelty takes hold. A young nun, Isabella, is told she can save her brother \u2013 but only in return for sex. Who can she turn to for help and will anyone believer her story? Lucy Phelps plays Isabella and Sandy Grierson the corrupt Angelo. Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, to 29 August; touring to 4 April MG Three of the best ... dance shows Invisible Cities It is the USP of Manchester international festival to create works that do not fit into ordinary categories. This one is an immersive mesh of dance, theatre and digital projections, based on the story of Marco Polo meeting the Kublai Khan, with collaborating creatives including Rambert, choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and 59 Productions. Mayfield, Manchester, Thursday 4 to 14 July Sara Baras This year\u2019s flamenco festival kicks off with Sara Baras, a gossip-mag-worthy star in Spain, who boasts blistering technique and great stage presence. This show, Sombras, celebrates the 20th anniversary of her company and focuses on the farruca footwork usually performed by men. Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1, Tuesday 2 to 7 July Alphabus Reggie \u201cRegg Roc\u201d Gray \u2013 Brooklyn\u2019s originator of the streetdance style flexing \u2013 pairs dancers from NYC with local poets to tackle stories from marginalised voices in what should be a thought-provoking blend of spoken word and dance.
