It entirely upends what I confess were my own preconceptions about what such a film would be: that is, a placid, consensual study, ruefully brooding on the sins of the fathers. This is far more challenging \u2013 and more disturbing. Sands interviews Niklas Frank and Horst von W\u00e4chter, the sons of Hans Frank and Otto W\u00e4chter, respectively (among their other grim distinctions) the Nazi governor of occupied Poland and Nazi governor of Galicia in Ukraine. It becomes disturbingly clear that although Frank Jr has come to terms with what his father did, W\u00e4chter Jr is still in denial \u2013 wriggling, squirming, trying to claim that his father was not personally guilty. Increasingly angry, Sands confronts him with documentary proof that Otto W\u00e4chter had substantial administrative responsibility for the slaughter of Ukrainian Jews, including Sands\u2019s own family. These are live issues: then as now, there are quasi-fascist strands of opinion in Ukraine that side with Nazi Germany for facing up to Russia. The film visits a creepy Nazi-nostalgist convocation of uniformed paramilitaries there, who hail Horst von W\u00e4chter as the son of a hero. W\u00e4chter is clearly pretty pleased. It is a chilling demonstration of how the poison of the past can live in the bloodstream of the present."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
