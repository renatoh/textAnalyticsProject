Long live Kate Moss! When she came to Glastonbury last summer, the photographs of Moss traipsing around looking fabulous would revolutionise our approach to the festival, we were told. No longer was it enough to slouch about in stained jeans and rainbow jumpers - now it was all about Westwood dresses and Pocahontas boots. This year, a proliferation of articles in glossy magazines have shown us \"How to do festival chic\". So we come to Glastonbury 2004, and what do we see? A lot of stained jeans and rainbow jumpers. Kate Moss v practicality - it's a very British kind of battle, and practicality has won. The thing is, Glastonbury generates its own trends. This year, apart from the traditional struggle against the soggy elements, there is a more grating obsession: footie came to Worthy Farm. From Lost Vagueness to the Dance Tent, you might as well have been in the Fulham Tup, with all the England flags-as-ponchos and similar style statements that accompany aggressive beeriness (as opposed to the usual blissed-out haziness). Face paint is no rarity here, but usually it is the glittertastic-fairy-child-lost-hippy variety rather than the flag-faced loons of this year. Fortunately, we wuz robbed, and by Friday morning all union flags and Burberry caps are hastily stuffed away. From then on it's business as usual: tie-dye burlap tops, rainbow jumpers, pixie ears and the dreaded fairy wings. They are the equivalent of the oddly patterned male \"party shirt\". Just as members of the male species need this shirt to tell others (and themselves) they are ready to pah-tay, so these folk (who would doubtless blah on about how \"free-spirited\" they are) always revert to their predictable uniform. Maybe it's a Pavlovian style statement, and without it they wouldn't know they were enjoying themselves. More interesting is how some make the bridge between schlock, festival practicality and trendiness. Take the tulle-laden prom dress: this has long been a festival staple due to its girly princess connotations, but has since gained a different kind of popularity because of the very un-Glastonbury Sex and the City. It was inevitable that they would appear here, among both hippies and those of a more materialist nature. Similarly, oversized sunglasses are very popular with designers for this summer, meaning that there have been quite a few homages to Dolce and Gabbana's summer collection wandering about the Green Fields, which I bet neither Dominico nor Stefano predicted. But these items are not the true fashion statement of this Glastonbury. That distinction belongs to Wellingtons, the new Uggs. After a winter of Ugg ubiquity (Ugguity?) women have at last realised (a) the comfort factor in flat boots and (b) the flattering nature of boots that are loose about the leg. Making the transition to Wellingtons in the summer is the natural progression, and splattering them with patterns is the inevitable Glastonbury twist. There is an element of the muddy catwalk to Glastonbury, as one would expect from a festival that attracts the likes of, well, Kate Moss. But this is also the country that's better than any other at making fashion accessible, tricking out \u00a335 versions of Chanel on every high street. At Glastonbury it's a similar story, as epitomised this year by paisley Wellingtons. Kate Moss, RIP. But people, you really should ditch the wings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
