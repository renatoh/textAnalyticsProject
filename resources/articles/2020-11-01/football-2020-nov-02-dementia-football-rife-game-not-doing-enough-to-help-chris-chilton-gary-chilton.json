Chris Chilton, 77, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular dementia in 2012. Eight years later he needs a level of care his family cannot afford. They did not know where to turn, or what to do. They felt utterly alone. This even though he was one of the best forwards in England in the 1960s. He scored a record 222 goals for Hull City, where he formed a famous strike partnership with Ken Wagstaff. The Professional Footballers\u2019 Association (PFA) paid for Chilton to spend four weeks in a care home and the family had pulled together enough from their savings to pay for a fortnight more. But that was about to run out. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just keep limping along like this,\u201d says his son Gary. His mother, Margaret, is 72, and has health problems of her own. Chris had been caring for her until he became ill. So Gary, who stayed nearby to help, decided it was time to sell his house and use the money to pay for care. \u201cI said we\u2019ll get maybe \u00a3100,000 and we\u2019ll do it that way.\u201d It was either that or else he would have to quit his job and move in to be a full-time carer. It was Wagstaff\u2019s daughter, Francesca Sharp, who found a solution. \u201cShe popped in to see me and my mum,\u201d Gary says. \u201cAnd she just looked at us and said: \u2018You two look like you\u2019re finished.\u2019 And we are, to be honest. My dad\u2019s at a stage now where he needs more than we can give him. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to get through the last eight years as best we can on our own, keeping him at home. But we\u2019ve got to that point now where he\u2019s lost all the skills you learn when you\u2019re a little child. It\u2019s like looking after a five-year-old again basically, but a five-year-old who can pick up knives and leave the gas burner on, or put lit cigarettes in the bin.\u201d Wagstaff set up a GoFundMe page. In seven days it raised more than \u00a330,000. \u201cThe support from fans, locally, nationally, and abroad, has blown us away,\u201d Gary says. \u201cMy dad was quite a humble bloke, never sought the limelight. He\u2019s got quite a career behind him, with all those records, but this has been unbelievable, a show of love and support we never ever thought we\u2019d see.\u201d Some former Hull players helped out \u2013 Nick Barmby, Steve McClaren, Dean Windass \u2013 and so did some famous fans, such as Sir Tom Courtenay, who has supported Hull since he was a boy. The club launched a clothing and merchandise line, the 222 Collection, and donated the proceeds. \u201cYou can understand,\u201d Gary says, \u201cit\u2019s been a very emotional week.\u201d But those emotions are bittersweet. Because you have to ask why the family are relying on crowdfunding, and whether the football authorities could be doing more to support them instead of leaving it to the fans. Chilton\u2019s illness has never been officially tied to his career but the family believe there is a link; that, like so many of the men he played with and against, he is living with dementia caused by playing football. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about it, me and my mum and my sister,\u201d Gary says. \u201cDad was a big, old-school No 9, heading was his forte and the balls they played with were just absolutely brutal.\u201d Gary describes his dad as \u201ca very similar sort of player to Jeff Astle\u201d. Chilton was also a teammate of Alan Jarvis. Astle and Jarvis had dementia caused by heading the ball and coroners ruled both men were killed by an industrial disease. \u201cJust like a miner,\u201d says Gary. Nobby Stiles, who died on Friday, also had dementia. And on Sunday Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s wife, Norma, confirmed he has the condition, too. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s rife, absolutely rife,\u201d Gary says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that England team from 66; quite a few of the Hull City side my dad played in have it too. Dad\u2019s in the pot of players from that era who have this illness and that pot is getting bigger all the time. Like it\u2019s rampant and it\u2019s absolutely devastating for families. It\u2019s torn ours apart. It\u2019s such a cruel, cruel disease, just absolutely evil. \u201cAnd for football it is the big elephant in the room. And the authorities are doing their best to divert attention away from it by giving little soothers to keep families pleasant, like a \u2018you\u2019re OK\u2019 type of thing.\u201d The PFA has provided the Chiltons with respite care and other financial support, and Gary speaks warmly of the welfare officer they have been working with. But he worries there is a limit to how much support it can give. He says the PFA has been encouraging the family to turn to social services. \u201cThey spoke to my Mum a week or so ago and in that phone call they were more or less driving us down the social services route. That was what she took from it.\u201d But he says their progress with social services stalled back in March, when the first lockdown started. \u201cThey shut all these cases down when all this crazy stuff started, and they said to us if the virus ever does go away we\u2019ll have to reapply and go through the whole process again, of creating his case from scratch.\u201d A spokesman for the PFA said it \u201cwill continue to support Chris and his family as we have done for a number of years\u201d. \u201cI think the sport is in denial,\u201d Gary says. \u201cI think they haven\u2019t done enough and they\u2019re not doing enough, because I think they\u2019re worried. I think they\u2019re worried about the size of this thing, the implications, and what it could mean if they do put their hand in the air and say: \u2018We know and we\u2019ve known about this for a long time.\u2019\u201d Even \u00a330,000 only buys so much time. Generous as the fans are, this is not a problem football is going to be able to fix through GoFundMe pages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
