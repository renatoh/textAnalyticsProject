As a long-term member of the Liberal Democrats who has rarely been satisfied with its leadership, I have always found that whenever my doubts have reached the point of thinking \"Why not just join Labour?\", Labour will say or do something which reminds me why not. Labour just does not get the Liberal Democrat left. We have taken the difficult road, sacrificing the political career that could be gained in the Labour party, with its votes and seats delivered by default, for one where every vote and seat has to be worked for. The prime reason for this is a passionate belief in political pluralism. We have seen how damaged the left has been through its dominance by just one party; it led to an arrogance and complacency from which the right triumphed. At great personal cost in time and money, we have built an alternative, one which \u2013 unlike Labour \u2013 accepts it has no right to anyone's vote. The fact that circumstances forced our party into a coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 does not mean that coalition is permanent. If Labour wishes us to work with it, it should demonstrate an alternative workable coalition \u2013 as it did not in May 2010. But our belief in political pluralism means that coalition should not be permanent either. Ed Miliband's call to make the Liberal Democrats extinct shows all we despise in Labour. If my pen were hovering over signing a Labour party membership card, hearing that would cause me to rip it up. Matthew Huntbach London \u2022\u2008Jackie Ashley is only the latest Guardian columnist to tell us how much the public loves the coalition. However, her analysis takes no account of the fact that its present popularity derives in large part from the cosy relationship that this government enjoys with the press. The previous administration, by contrast, operated in a context of unremitting, virulent hostility from almost all newspapers \u2013 including, for the most part, this one. And as to Nick Clegg's valiant good humour, despite the risks he is taking with his political career, there is surely no reason for him to be unduly concerned. If the coalition should fall apart and the Liberal Democrats are decimated at the next election, no doubt \u2013 in the fullness of time \u2013 Clegg, Cable, Huhne etc will be rewarded with seats in the Lords. Not a bad result for a clutch of politicians who actually lost ground at the last election. Dr David Mervin Arnside, Cumbria \u2022\u2008I do wonder if Jackie Ashley's concerns about tone will be matched by those put out of work by coalition actions. Labour needs to shout much more loudly about its achievements. Last week we had lengthy debates about rising inflation, a topic hardly ever raised in the past 13 years because of prudent economic management. My tone (temper) increases daily as I read continuing expression by Guardian writers of how Clegg is really a nice boy. If he likes power, why is he using it to make choices he despised 120 days ago? John Fisher Whixley, North Yorkshire \u2022\u2008Self-deprecation and owning up to past mistakes would indeed be an attractive response to electoral defeat, and more appealing in the light of the public's evident disillusion with politics across the board. There were, after all, no winners on 5 May. However, the problem for Labour is that in order to do so, the leadership contenders, as well as the rest of the party hierarchy, need to start accepting that they really did make mistakes (starting with the Iraq war) and show that they now have an alternative, fair and ethically sound, programme to propose. Gillian Dalley London \u2022\u2008\"Leaving your party is the most honourable course when your party leadership leaves you,\" says Ed Miliband (Dear Lib Dem voter, 24 August). Perhaps if, when illegal wars were being planned, liberties casually abandoned and health and education services marketised, Ed Miliband and a few dozen party colleagues had themselves acted honourably, this entirely dishonourable appeal would not have been necessary.
