Once Scotland shook off their early anxiety, this was not a win to flatter a side riven with faults that would certainly be exposed by more expert opposition. But since two of their goals came from the unlikeliest of sources, their captain and defender Colin Hendry, it was hardly a devastating show of firepower either. San Marino conceded five goals during the last fifteen minutes of their 10-1 rout by Belgium last month. Last night, they kept a clean sheet during the same period: a feat that will no doubt lead to the erection of a small statue in the republic. Scotland began with all but two of the side who lined up against Belgium on Saturday, Barry Ferguson out with a rib injury and the defender Tom Boyd's perhaps surplus to requirements against a side who largely lived up to the expectation of giving attacking football only the most cursory of glances. They came, drunk in the pre-match atmosphere, looked proficient enough during their warm up and proceeded to play as if Neil Sullivan's goal was a misty isle on a congested tourist itinerary: to be viewed, but not visited. That said, San Marino began with a spring in their step and when Andy Selva - their only professional - and Riccardo Muccioli strung a couple of passes together through the Scottish middle with five minutes gone, an uneasy silence descended on a reasonably full Hampden Park. And when, in the 12th minute, Muccioli threaded a pass to Selva, who beat the Scotland offside trap, the best opportunity of the game had Sullivan almost handle the ball outside his box. Otherwise, the resolve of the tourists to pack their defence not only spoiled any notion of a contest but also drew the sting out of Scotland's self- belief. Step forward captain Hendry. Ordinarily, he would be expected to be in the thick of things at Scotland corners. But as the home side tried to calm their nerves by making corners count, Hendry assumed the role of roving predator. First, after Matt Elliott had headed Craig Burley's corner on to the woodwork, Hendry was on hand to mop up with a curling left-foot shot into the far corner from eight yards out. Minutes later, he was cleaning up from the edge of the box with a thundering, half-volley with his right foot that took everyone by surprise. He had scored in only one other international, against Malta in 1993. Within seconds of that, game over. Allan Johnston battled for possession on the right, Don Hutchison chipped the cross and Billy Dodds launched himself between Luca Gobbi and Simone Della Balda to head powerfully home. In the space of 10 minutes Scotland had gone from creaking to cruise control. Such games inevitably settle into passages of patient but frustrating probing for the next chink in the visitor's armour; Scotland endured Dodds heading on to the post and Hutchison being denied by Frederico Gasperoni's left-foot before extending their advantage. Johnston threw in the long cross, Kevin Gallacher - just on for Dominic Matteo - headed back into the danger zone and, as Craig Burley breezed forward to ruffle feathers, Colin Cameron made his latest, timed incursion tell with the side-footed shot. Scotland (3-5-2): Sullivan; Weir, Elliott, Hendry; Johnston, Burley, Lambert, Cameron, Matteo; Dodds, Hutchison. San Marino (4-5-1): Gasperoni; Della Balda, Bacciocchi, Matteoni, Gobbi; Manzaroli, Zonzini, Muccioli, Vannucci, Marani; Selva. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
