If the teachers or the social workers or the Home Office officials had acted differently, they believe, he would still be alive today. After Wednesday\u2019s verdict in the Old Bailey trial of Ayoub Majdouline, a 19-year-old drug dealer who in 2018 had been classed as a victim of modern slavery over concerns he was being exploited, Jaden\u2019s loved ones held hands in court and said: \u201cYes. For Jaden, we\u2019ve done it.\u201d But while the conviction \u2013 of just one of the five members of the Mali Boys gang believed to have played a part in the killing \u2013 brought temporary relief, their grief will not be numbed. \u201cSometimes my son appears in front of me and stares into my eyes,\u201d Jaden\u2019s father, Julian, told the Guardian. \u201cHe died brutally at such a young age. It was supposed to be him burying me, not the other way round.\u201d Julian was deported from the UK in 2009 and he was allowed to attend the end of the trial only after a court battle with the Home Office. In January this year his son was riding a moped in east London when a stolen Mercedes knocked him to the road. Its passengers got out and killed him as he lay defenceless on the ground. Majdouline\u2019s trial heard that Jaden was dealing drugs for the Beaumont Crew, a rival gang to the Mali Boys. Jaden\u2019s sister Leah says her early childhood memories are of a happy family life. She and Jaden were among five siblings; Julian worked long hours on a building site while his wife, Jada Bailey, worked for the Post Office. \u201cMy dad made me feel safe and protected and like a proper family,\u201d Leah wrote years later. After the 7/7 attacks in 2005, security was tightened up at the building site and Julian, who did not have a national insurance number, was no longer able to work. He turned to selling drugs to support the family and ultimately received a three-and-a-half-year sentence, which led to his deportation. Jada became the sole breadwinner. But she suffered a devastating back injury while at work, which led to an extended period off sick with little money coming into the household. Times became very hard for the family. A few years after her dad was deported to Jamaica, Leah, then 14, wrote an eloquent letter to the Home Office imploring officials to let him return to the UK because his children needed him so desperately. She wrote that the deportation \u201ccaused catastrophic heartbreak in my family. I couldn\u2019t eat or sleep for weeks. I just wanted my dad back in my life.\u201d She also told officials about her mother\u2019s back injury and how, as a result of the family\u2019s financial struggles, sometimes there was no food in the house. And in a chillingly prophetic remark, her letter referred to the impact on Jaden of growing up without his father. \u201cMy dad was a role model to us all, especially my little brother,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut now there\u2019s no role model for my brother to look up to. He looks at other kids going to football matches and the park with their dads and looks at me and says: \u2018That should be me and dad.\u2019\u201d The letter went on: \u201cMy dad made a mistake but we all have. Jesus is the only one without sin.\u201d She concluded by thanking the Home Office for reading her letter and said: \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be able to help.\u201d It could not. She received a chilly reply saying deportation orders remained in place until they were revoked and that officials could not discuss her father\u2019s case with her because she was a \u201cthird party\u201d. \u201cOur lives would have been completely different if the Home Office had let my dad stay here,\u201d Leah says now. \u201cI believe with my whole heart that if they\u2019d allowed him to stay Jaden would still be alive today.\u201d Leah is now 19 and working two jobs to try to keep the family afloat. \u201cEverything has been a blur since the day Jaden was murdered,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cry because I\u2019ve got no tears left. Jaden has been appearing to me in nightmares. Having to sit through the murder trial has brought us right back to day one. Our family is dealing with trauma on top of trauma on top of trauma.\u201d After Julian\u2019s enforced departure, the family worked hard to keep Jaden safe. But they say that while living in Nottingham he was badly bullied and experienced racist abuse at school. They say he was excluded when he defended himself against the attacks. Fearing he could be exploited by unscrupulous adults who wanted to use him to sell drugs and pull him into gang culture once he was no longer at school, Jaden\u2019s mum begged for help from education and social services officials. No one appeared to be listening. At one point, in desperation, Jada home-schooled her son for more than a year. Despite the family\u2019s efforts, Jaden\u2019s problems grew. In March 2018, when he was 13, he was given a youth conditional caution after police seized an air pistol, a knife and some cannabis during an alteraction in Nottingham. In November last year he admitted appearing in a Snapchat video with an imitation firearm. Majdouline\u2019s trial heard that Jaden was the youngest member of the Beaumont Crew. To the family, the focus on these details is an insult to their suffering. Jaden\u2019s aunt Tesfa Green says the family has been \u201cdragged to hell and back\u201d during the trial, and that the \u201cfetishisation\u201d of gang rivalries and focus on Jaden\u2019s activities made them feel it was Jaden rather than Majdouline who was on trial. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to demonise a family, what difference does it make whether we\u2019re good or bad?\u201d she asked. \u201cA little boy is still dead. My family radiate love. We adored Jaden. I could give you a list longer than my arm of our attempts to safeguard Jaden.\u201d She lists steps the family took to try to keep him safe: the home-schooling, a summer in Jamaica with his father so that he might be out of the reach of adults who would exploit him, and his mother\u2019s pleas for help. Meanwhile, Jaden\u2019s loved ones were also living in fear. His mother and sister were both threatened by gang members. Although Jada complained to police and social services, the family say no action was taken to protect them or Jaden. Part of the family\u2019s frustration is that so much is known about the gangs in Waltham Forest, the London borough where Jaden was living at the time of his death, but they say not enough has been done to stop these gangs from flourishing. Waltham Forest council commissioned a study, From Postcodes To Profits, looking at gangs in the borough, particularly the Mali Boys. It said the gang was \u201ca violent and feared group across the borough\u201d. Green said: \u201cChildren\u2019s services and schools know which kids are at risk. The question is: what are they doing about it?\u201d A spokeswoman for Waltham Forest council said: \u201cOur hearts go out to everyone who knew and loved Jaden.\u201d She said exclusions such as Jaden\u2019s were \u201cnever taken lightly\u201d and came down to balancing \u201caddressing individual behavioural issues alongside the needs of the wider running of the school\u201d. Gang prevention funding had been increased by \u00a3800,000 over the next three years, she added. At the trial it emerged that the killer had been part of a grim cycle of violence himself, having fallen into drug-dealing to \u201csurvive\u201d after his father, Othamane Majdouline, was beaten to death with a hammer at his flat in King\u2019s Cross, London. Othamane Majdouline\u2019s killer had been visiting the flat to buy drugs. Ayoub Majdouline told the court he had been abused at the home he shared with his mother and stepfather. After his father died he went into care, and he came to be classed as a victim of modern slavery. After the guilty verdict, Jaden\u2019s mother again described her despair at his death and said that in her view the problems he faced were all the result of being a loyal friend. \u201cYou send your child to school and you think they\u2019re going to be safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of people to blame. It\u2019s the groomers, it\u2019s the dealers. It\u2019s all sorts.\u201d She added: \u201cI just miss him so terribly. I just want him home.\u201d Jaden\u2019s family say they will never get used to life without him. Green said councils knew which children were at risk of significant harm and of recruitment to gangs. \u201cOur kids are on their books,\u201d she said. \u201cTeachers also know which of their kids are vulnerable. But instead of supporting those children, they are funnelling them into the pipeline of criminalisation by excluding them from school.\u201d The family are calling for a public inquiry to try to break the cycle of these killings, and an immediate freeze on school exclusions as an important first step. They have also set up the Jaden Moodie Movement, working with grassroots organisations to support vulnerable children. \u201cWe have become complacent and desensitised to the murder of children,\u201d said Green. \u201cNo 14-year-old deserves to be mowed down and terrorised. We have paid the highest price possible and we\u2019re committed to ensuring that no other family pays it too. That\u2019s what Jaden would have wanted.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
