I scarcely knew there was enough cello octet repertoire to fill a concert, let alone justify the formation of a professional chamber group. But the real surprise lay in the variety of tone and effect the cellists conjured in this programme of 20th- and 21st-century works. A rarely performed piece by Luciano Berio was the opener. Korot sets fragmentary counterpoint against moments of textural and thematic homogeny, the pull of which is increased by the uniformity of the instrumentation. It is a nicely poised work that, despite its expressive modesty, is thrilling to hear when played with this kind of precision and sensitivity. The Berio was succeeded by Boulez's Messagesquisses (for a mere seven cellos), Giovanni Sollima's Violoncelles, Vibrez! (a stylistic splicing of Morricone and Reich) and two new works. The first, by Adam Gorb, only half succeeded in his aim to create a \"vast and varied soundworld\" and lacked concision; the second was by Richard Birchall, Cellophony's director and an evidently gifted composer as well as performer. His three-movement Mirrors played to the grouping's strengths, and made up for what it lacked in structural variety by packing both punch and promise. The evening's second concert was less of a success. The Catalan pianist N\u00e8stor Bayona Pifarr\u00e9 displayed more muscle than magic; and though soprano Rhona McKail is possessed of a beguilingly open-toned voice, her traversal of Lord Berners's settings of Heine and Jean-Aubry, competently accompanied by Yshani Perinpanayagam, was marred by an absence of control and wit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
