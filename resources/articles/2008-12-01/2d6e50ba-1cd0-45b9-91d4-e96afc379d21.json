Few lawyers outside the union field specialised in representing the injured; the work was legally aided; and it felt right representing the ordinary person on the street against corporate Britain. The intervening 25 years have slowly but surely dragged personal injury lawyers into the mire. The onset of referral fees, the resulting \"selling of cases\", the \"no win, no fee\" system, the advertising of firms and the factory line approach to personal injury claims have all played their role in cheapening the work. It is no longer just the Daily Mail who call us \"ambulance chasers\". However, without question, what has been happening with the miners' claims has done more to damage our profession than any other single event. The idea that lawyers who were already making a mint out of the legal fees obtainable from the government for the work they were doing were then gilding the lily by extracting money from the claimants as well shows quite how low the profession has sunk. The decision on Thursday by the Solicitors' Regulatory Authority to strike off two solicitors from the solicitors' roll can only be applauded. It is a shame that this did not happen sooner. I have no problem with claimants' lawyers extracting from the defendants in any case the maximum possible costs as long as they are reasonable. Defendants have many means to protect their position and to ensure that the fees being charged are fair. If lawyers become well-off as a result of this, then good luck to them. Indeed, I know of a number of law firms working for the miners who have done well out of the government compensation scheme without looking to the claimants for a penny. It is, however, the charging of the claimants that brings us into such disrepute. In my experience, the vast majority of clients put themselves in our hands and expect that we will do our best for them and ensure we get them the best possible deal. Charging clients in this sort of situation totally undermines that trust, and the actions of the lawyers from Beresfords (and elsewhere undertaking the same practices) have cast a cloud over the work of personal injury lawyers that will take many years to dispel. I still believe that accident lawyers have a key role to play in our society and that we can get away from the \"Del Boy\" image of recent years. But any more miners-style sagas and our collective reputations will never recover."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
