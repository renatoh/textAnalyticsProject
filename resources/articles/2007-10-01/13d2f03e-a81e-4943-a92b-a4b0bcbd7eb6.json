My mother, 86 and living alone, is in the process of upgrading her night-storage heaters, taking advantage of a government scheme. Four power companies are involved: one to fit a mains isolator, one to fit the new heaters, one supplier of electricity at the start of the process, and another to which she was obliged to transfer as part of the deal. The old heaters were removed in May and the new ones have not yet been fitted. A couple of weeks ago, armed with a paperback against the background music, I phoned around. It took a dozen calls around these companies in turn before one cause of delay became apparent: she should not have been transferred to the new supplier. Everyone I phoned was polite and some who were helpful phoned back when they said they would. But my mother still does not have a date for fitting the new heaters. Leaving aside this misery-go-round, it is hard to believe that a system of multiple suppliers of electricity can be more efficient than a single supplier. There is bound to be a transfer of resources to sales and advertising that could be better used elsewhere, and presumably one board of directors would come cheaper than half a dozen. Perhaps some enthusiast could explain the attractions. Patrick Shaw Glasgow"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
