I'm standing in the crowded, dusty, garishly carpeted Binion's Horseshoe casino in downtown Las Vegas. It is the 31st annual World Series of Poker. At this point in my poker career, I am only here to watch. The buy-in fee for the tournament is $10,000: this is a luxury for millionaires, a handful of \"professional poker players\" (if, in 2003, such a thing really exists) and those lucky enough to win their seats in competitions. There are a few more people than usual playing the 2003 tournament. This is because a new system has recently been launched whereby you can win seats on the internet. What an idea! Playing poker alone on a computer, using a credit card, against opponents whose faces you can't see? It'll never work\u2026 So there are more contestants, but of the usual type: middle-aged men in big hats and shiny belt buckles, eating and drinking and smoking while they play. I am surprised to see a beautiful young woman in the crowd, shouting, in a cut-glass English accent: \"Go Daddy Wheeler! Go Daddy Wheeler!\" Following her eyeline, the story becomes clear. The millionaire owner of spread-betting firm IG Index, Stuart Wheeler, has treated himself to a World Series ticket, had a good run and made his way into the prize money. His daughter is here to lend support. Mr Wheeler finishes 33rd for $35,000. According to official records, he has never cashed in a poker tournament before or since. Thus, I was not surprised to see, during last week's little press scandal, that he has rather lost touch with the game. Arguing against the idea that there should be more women on the boards of companies, Stuart Wheeler (now retired from IG Index and ensconced as treasurer of Ukip) said: \"Business is very, very competitive and you should take the performance of women in another competitive area\u2026 Chess, bridge, poker \u2013 women come absolutely nowhere.\" Others have kindly pointed out that Stuart Wheeler must have missed the disproportionate recent success of women in poker: 23 female poker millionaires in the official rankings list, topped by the phenomenal Vanessa Selbst who has won $7,398,454. (I'm tenth, with $1.7m.) But Mr Wheeler is missing something far more important than that. He may know that poker has undergone a revolution, thanks mainly to the fact that the ultimate winner of that 2003 World Series (the magically named Chris Moneymaker, a likable accountant from Tennessee) was an internet qualifier: he'd won his seat on PokerStars.com for $39 and spun it into $2.5m. Millions flooded after him, transforming poker from a shady endeavour for the adventurous few into a massive pastime for an entire generation. But it is no longer, as Stuart Wheeler clearly imagines, about big hats and ballsy bluffs. Try that on the modern poker scene and even his fortune could be obliterated in weeks. The millions of new young players, many with maths degrees, brought a revolution in technical strategy. Belligerent old Texans, still relying on primitive ideas of aggression and bluster, have been left in the dust. You do not succeed by being more \"competitive\" than your opponent, but by being cleverer. In other words, Mr Wheeler's poker point proves that he overestimates the value of muscle. We have all realised this in poker, but the business world is glacially slow to catch on. It is the masculine prejudices of the stock market, towards big-hat aggression and high-pressure manoeuvres, that led to the financial mess where we currently find ourselves. Macho competition on trading floors led to over-reaching, borrowed money, crashes \u2013 and subsequent demands for huge bonuses from the men who triggered them, on the grounds that this bull-headed approach is a rare and special skill. If Stuart Wheeler approached me for poker advice, I would tell him what I tell all aspiring players: the first rule is not to go skint. The second rule is to make a profit, however small. Those who are blinded by ego, interested only in vast wins and huge adrenaline rushes, end up trapped in the escalating debt scenario that currently threatens the entire western economy. Stuart Wheeler made a personal fortune with his business, but it was a betting company. It did not build or create anything. On such shifting sands sit the precarious national economies of today. In poker's official list of all-time money winners (all genders) I am 525th. That's actually pretty good, but my secret truth is the more important lesson for would-be gamblers. If you take account of poker losses (which the official records do not), I am in much better shape than many of the 524 who are officially above me. I play far more rarely and selectively than most pros, so my statistical win rate is higher; also, I take fewer risks so have kept more of my winnings. I have flaws as a player, of course, but over-reaching myself for reasons of ego isn't one of them. Is this because I'm female? I suspect that's hugely relevant. It is only my personal observation, but it seems that women gamble less (even while we are in the act of gambling) because we are slower to separate the betting chips from the reality of food and shoes. This operates as a check on recklessness. Opponents will say this is a weakness in my poker game. I will think (but do not say): I bet my bank account is healthier than yours. Therefore, if, like Stuart Wheeler, I were looking to poker for a comfortable, gender-based generalisation about world affairs, I would make precisely the opposite point. If our western economies were in female hands then perhaps we would not be staring at our empty fingers and wondering: where did all that money go? www.victoriacoren.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
