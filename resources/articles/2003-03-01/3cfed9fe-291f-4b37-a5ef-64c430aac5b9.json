An independent review is about to report back to the government, although its doubtful anything major will happen before the Shipman inquiry is finished [into issues arising from Dr Harold Shipman's murder of at least 200 patients in the Manchester area] - and I think that could be another year away. But both of these seem to be moving towards suggesting further medical intervention between the point of death and the coroner - a kind of medical coroner, in contrast to our role as judicial coroners. I'll probably have retired by the time anything happens but there's some anxiety about it among younger colleagues because we don't know whether this new tier will be in the coroner system, working under our umbrella, or outside us. So there could be less work around - spread over wider areas than now. There could be roles created, such as chief coroner for the north-west, with us all doing fewer full inquiries and an end to automatic inquiries for things like suicides, and road deaths. The verdict system may also change so that we just record a narrative of what happened. A main goal is that they want someone to have an overview so that something like Shipman could never happen again. In recent years a big change has been how accessible we now are. When I started, in the 1960s, and someone asked us a question, we'd say \"wait until the inquest\". Now we are much more approachable and I spend a lot of time answering correspondence from the public and lawyers. I suppose this is an increase in the \"service\" element of the job - and the change has come from the changing demands of the public, rather than government design. People are more suspicious and want to know if hospitals were to blame, even when staff there seemed to do all they could for their relative. There's much more work now, but I don't really resent it, although I think we are underpaid, in comparison to district judges - I think we have to do much more than them. Although I guess our rise of 7.5% this year was good in comparison with what's happening elsewhere. I'd like to see us being able to use more deputies in investigations. Overall, though, we are a happy ship here. There is talk of getting judges to take over more complex cases but I would oppose this - it's a bit patronising. Complex cases have the same sadness, of course, but they have more professional satisfaction for us. We are more in the media spotlight now, but you have to get used to that and I have a good relationship with the press. The case of the policeman who was killed in Manchester recently [Stephen Oake] was difficult for us because we work so closely with the police. What you have to remember though is that it's someone's family member who has died. That's the case even for these gang members who get shot dead - they're still somebody's son. Public voices: March 21 2002 HM Coroner to the City of Manchester Salary: \u00a366,000 There has been no real change in my work this year; I'm still conducting courts in the morning and I tend to do administration in the afternoons. I also give talks - in hospitals, to doctors and various societies. Today I was talking to transplant nurses about the role of the coroner and how it impinges on the work they do. When I give talks to the public, it tends to be more about information on how the court functions or anecdotes and stories about different cases. In the past few years there has been a change in the way people respond to my job - they ask more questions, they want information, partly it's because they are more suspicious (of the courts in general, of the police, of hospitals), particularly after Alder Hey and the Shipman case. There is more anxiety and more concern. The government is setting up a Fundamental Coroners Review - it shows that our work is being considered and I personally feel it is valuable. We are not paid anything near what we should be, but there has been a 10% increase this year - the pay for a coroner is between \u00a362,500 and \u00a368,000. There is no comparable job in the private sector. When I came out of private law practice, and was offered a job in the coroner's office I was asked what I thought of the pay. I said \"not a lot\" and that's what it was. If I'd remained in private practice I'd be earning about twice the salary I'm on now. My working conditions are fine, but as we are in the magistrate's court, it's not ideal for families and witnesses - they have to mingle with people in criminal trials. But they are about to pull down the building and there should be a new one in about two or three years. Prudence Hone The Common Good: March 21 2001 Coroner, Manchester Salary: \u00a360,000 I trained as a solicitor and worked at a practice in Salford. While I was there, I became deputy to the Salford coroner and enjoyed the work. I then started to work part-time as a coroner, but still maintaining my private practice. When the job of coroner for the City of Manchester came up in 1974, I applied for it. There are four coroners in Greater Manchester; we obviously work closely with the police, with whom we have excellent relations - we're assisted by about 6,000 officers and we have a staff of six (clerks, ushers) who work here in the coroner's office. We're located in the magistrates' court building. We have very good conditions and we're lucky to have a full complement of pathologists - there are several teaching hospitals in the city. On four or five mornings a week I am in court, conducting inquests - I deal with about 500 a year. The rest of the day is taken up with paperwork: going through cases still to be heard, corresponding with solicitors, or answering queries from members of the public. There are also questions from doctors and hospitals to be dealt with. I've always enjoyed my work - some of it is obviously routine, but when the cases are very involved, it is fascinating. I don't have any medical training, but obviously you pick up things over the years. Some coroners come from medical backgrounds, most from the legal professions. I don't know if I would describe it as a vocation; I liked it enough to give up private practice, where I would probably be earning twice as much. I do feel I'm making a contribution, yes. It is involving ? Although you are often dealing with tragedy you have to maintain a distance in order to do the job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
