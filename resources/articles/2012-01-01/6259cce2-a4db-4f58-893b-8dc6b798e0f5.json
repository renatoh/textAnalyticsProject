His former employers Larissa state that they are to sue the Football Association of Wales over the appointment of Coleman, who gave up his post as manager of the Greek club as recently as 8 January. There was no official statement from the FAW but they are believed to be unconcerned. Coleman himself had referred to personal matters and financial issues at Larissa, a second-tier club, as the motives for his resignation. If compensation did turn out to be required, the sums may not be large given that he was merely on a one-year contract with an option for a further season. The topic will not be uppermost in his thoughts as he starts work with the national team. There was as much pathos as ambition in Coleman's heart on the day of his appointment. The job is his following the vacancy that arose with the death of a friend and former team-mate in the national side. Gary Speed took his own life last month. \"I was very close friends with Gary for 30 years,\" said Coleman, who was sure that he and others would never come to terms fully with his death. Coleman had applied for the Wales manager's job when Speed was appointed in 2010 and Coleman bore that setback with good grace. \"Gary beat me to the post,\" he said. \"I called him up and we had a joke and a laugh.\" The recollections well up, too, of another type of familiarity on the training ground. \"We were always at one another if we were in opposite teams,\" Coleman said, \"because we were competitive. I loved being in his company. All my memories are of super quality.\" Speed was first to get a cap with the senior team and his first opponents, Costa Rica, will again take on Wales in a friendly at Cardiff City's stadium next month that will commemorate him and his service over the course of 85 international appearances. Even so, it is too soon for serene appreciation of Speed. \"There is still shock about what happened,\" Coleman said, \"and I think we're all still grieving. I think the only way to put smiles on people's faces is to try to play the best we can, continue to try and win matches and continue to progress.\" The best tribute to Speed would be a continuation of the strong form displayed towards the close of an otherwise unsuccessful campaign in the Euro 2012 qualifiers, but sustaining momentum is hard. There are matters to be resolved and Raymond Verheijen, the Dutch coach who worked with Speed, has failed to succeed him and may have made enemies after suggesting quite quickly that he ought to inherit the job. According to some reports, Verheijen's contract runs out at the end of this month. The new manager appears to have change in mind. \"I've got a very strong relationship with Kit Symons,\" Coleman said. \"He's doing a great job at Fulham with the under-18s. \"Every job I've taken, I've not gone in with a big axe. I don't work like that, but at the same time I like to take some faces that I know, so that is a big possibility. Raymond's obviously an opinionated guy. I don't know Raymond [although] I've been in his company. I respect Raymond and if I do have a problem I'll have that conversation with him.\" All the same, that is not the key issue for Wales. Coleman, in his efforts to sustain the national team's momentum, will be particularly eager to keep Craig Bellamy in the lineup, although it was the persuasiveness of Speed that brought his return. The new manager feels the sadness of his predecessor's death keenly because the work that had been done is all around him. \"I spoke with the FAW members,\" Coleman reported, \"and I said: 'Excuse me if I don't seem that excited. I'm just a little bit subdued because of the circumstances.' There's still shock about what happened and I think we're all still grieving. We've just got to let that happen. But I don't kid myself, we'll never get over the loss of Gary.\" Even so, he is certainly sharp enough to know that this looks like one of the better periods to be in charge of Wales if representation in the Premier League is any guide. Coleman can point not only to Aaron Ramsey of Arsenal, the Wales captain under Speed, but to other Welshmen making an impression. Even without the promotion of Swansea City and the impact of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale, it was notable that their countrymen were becoming more conspicuous around the Premier League. Coleman will be glad, but he may also feel that much is now expected of him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
