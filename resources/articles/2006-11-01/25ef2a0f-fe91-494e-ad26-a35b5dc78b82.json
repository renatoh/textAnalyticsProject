He has also recently become the first ever director of education at the Royal Society, the UK's leading academy of science. It makes him the collective voice of the UK's best scientists on how the next generation of scientific minds should be educated. The society has given its blessing to the concept of \"scientific literacy\" in the classroom. Students - whether they go on to study science or not - should be taught about socio-scientific issues. \"It matters hugely,\" says Reiss. \"Science so connects with the decisions we all make - both in our everyday lives and as citizens in a democratic state.\" New science courses The ideas were most recently exposed to public controversy last month, Reiss's first full month in the new job, when a new set of GCSE science courses for England and Wales was introduced under the umbrella of \"21st-century science\". Students start by studying a GCSE in core science (the new scientific literacy qualification). They can then also study \"additional science\" - a science for scientists' qualification - or the more vocational \"additional applied science\". Extra topics in the scientists' option can lead to three GCSE awards in biology, chemistry and physics. Supportive of the move, Reiss describes the new courses as a \"significant shift\" away from the traditional aim of school science - to prepare candidates for A-levels. \"This suite of GCSEs is trying to do two things that some people think incommensurable,\" says Reiss. \"It is trying both to provide a genuine education in science for the majority who will not study it after the age of 16, and to be an exciting and challenging basis for those who, we hope, will study after the age of 16.\" Controversially, Reiss also says the new courses increase creationism's presence in the science classroom. \"I think all the new GCSE science courses open up the possibilities for discussions about socio-scientific issues, including creationism,\" he says, in what can only be ammunition to scientific literacy's naysayers. Reiss started training to be a priest in the Church of England when he was 29 and a schoolteacher, and was ordained three years later. He leads the Sunday service in his local village near Cambridge. Yet his faith has meant that up to now he has steered clear of writing about religion and science education. \"I have always been a bit worried about being typecast in the science or religion mould,\" he says, stressing that he is an evolutionary biologist. Creationism But in the spring of 2007, he will launch a book with an American academic, Sandy Jones, on teaching science to students who come from creationist homes. \"I am really interested in how you teach in a way that is true to science, but doesn't put many capable, sensitive young people off science for life, nor denigrate them,\" says Reiss. His answer is not to be overly defensive, but to encourage an analysis of the evidence. \"I am not expecting every young person to change their mind just because of five or 10 hours of science teaching ... I love having intelligent 15-year-olds who will cheerfully argue their corner,\" he says. But, following the Royal Society's line, Reiss stresses his opposition to the teaching of creationism in science classes (though teachers should be able to deal with it if it comes up in discussion). \"There is a role for science teachers. Religious education teachers can't be expected to know about the evidence for and against evolution,\" he explains. In addition to science education, Reiss lists sex education and bioethics as his research areas. He is the inaugural editor of the journal Sex Education and is passionate about improving the way the subject is taught. Given the UK's lead status among European nations for teenage pregnancy, it seems reasonable. \"Sex education in this country varies hugely across schools,\" he says. Born to a Jewish, obstetrician father and an agnostic, midwife mother, Reiss had a comfortable secular upbringing in north London. He was educated at Westminster school, and a \"superb\" teacher inspired him to take physics at Cambridge. \"I remember these wonderful discussions which were almost always at the edge of my understanding.\" But he had a rude awakening, and two weeks after he arrived, he changed to biology, completing his PhD and a post-doc in zoology . It was while supervising undergraduates that he decided he liked teaching and enrolled to do a PGCE. He taught biology for five years before being lured back to the university to lecture in science education - first in the Department of Education, and then at the education college, Homerton. He arrived at the Institute of Education in 2001. He describes his teaching days as \"utterly crucial\" to his current work. Reiss was involved in creating the new GCSE courses as part of a project at the University of York, where he holds a visiting chair, for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. The project determined the extent to which scientific literacy should feature across all the courses. Others created the final course specifications, which Reiss is not afraid to criticise. He describes the core science as \"a risk -but a risk worth taking. I am afraid we won't see [the results] properly for 18 months.\" A furore of debate followed the introduction of the new courses. Richard Sykes, the rector of Imperial College, accused them of \"dumbing down\", while philosopher Mary Warnock described them as \"fit for the pub\". Reiss says they might not have been so critical if they had known more about it. \"If only [Sykes] had had an hour with somebody beforehand, it might have allowed him to see what the potential of these courses is,\" says Reiss. The Royal Society will doubtless keep him busy with many other topics on his part-time, two-year secondment. High on the agenda will be pushing the government to increase the numbers of specialist physics and chemistry teachers and ensure there are enough to meet student demand. The society also wants to see a second maths GCSE introduced. For Reiss, addressing teacher shortages needs both a long-term strategy, to ensure that first-rate science and maths graduates want to enter the profession, and immediate stop-gap measures. He sees the quickest solution as retraining large numbers of biology teachers to teach physics and chemistry. He's currently working with a stakeholder group to devise a conversion course. \"It's the only way, to be honest,\" he says, \"and it is not impossible. After all, I was a physics person who converted into biology.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
