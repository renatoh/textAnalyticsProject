She was the first woman to gain a Pro licence coaching qualification in this country, the youngest ever England manager (she is now 42) and the first ever female national coach. Since her appointment as England manager in 1998 Powell has dragged the domestic women's game, kicking and screaming, into the modern era. A visionary for the sport, she has worked tirelessly to create a structure that develops players from grassroots level all the way up to the elite end of the game. \"If you looked at her job description there's not many people who could do it,\" said Mo Marley, the Everton and England Under-19s manager. \"I don't think many people even realise how much she does. She's in charge of five separate teams [senior team, U23, U19, U17 and U15], most managers have one team not five, plus the specialist staff that goes alongside that. Her job description is phenomenal and yet everything is functioning effectively. To do all that is unbelievable.\" Powell's approach has always been holistic, reasoning that if the England senior team are to be any good, then the youth set-up below them, the league and the grassroots all need to be in similarly good health. Forging that continuity has been integral to England's success on the international stage. Her attention to detail is renowned. She may be coaching the seniors and overseeing four other England youth teams but if there aren't enough toasters in the team hotel, or if the heating is the wrong temperature, Powell is the kind of coach to notice and act upon it. Powell, a member of the England team that last reached a European Championship final 25 years ago, brought a level of professionalism to the English game that had not previously existed. She battled hard with the establishment to secure the funds to recruit backroom staff such as sports scientists and a sports psychologist, who have all played integral roles in the England success story. \"Reaching this final is a culmination of years of hard work so we're all enjoying the moment,\" Marley said. \"With women's football it is always a battle but she's worked to ensure there is some equality. She's fought hard to get specialist people on board, she's fought hard to get additional squads, but all those things she fought for in the past are part of the reason we've moved on to better things.\" It needed a formidable character to do it. As a black woman with dreadlocks (now shorn) she was never going to blend in with the establishment but her ability to both challenge and work within the power structure of the game has reaped rewards. As the results on the pitch grew, reaching the quarter-finals of the 2007 World Cup with the senior side, so did her stature. Powell's influence on England's style of play has won her compliments from Uefa, says Sir Trevor Brooking, who has long been a vocal supporter of the women's game through his role as director of development at the Football Association. \"When the Under-19s won the European Championship this summer we had a lot of compliments from Uefa. They felt they were a very good technical side. That's a good pathway to kick on and Hope has been a key element in that,\" he said Brooking will be in Helsinki this evening to watch the final. \"It's great they've got to the final,\" he says. \"Hope is an extremely focused lady, very committed to the women's game and she has really worked very hard with this group of players to make them better and to progress. The results on the pitch demonstrate that.\" Marley says that success at senior and Under-19 level this year was all part of Powell's long-term strategy. \"We anticipated that the Under-19s would win this summer and we knew this would be a big tournament for the seniors. You've got to look at where we've come from \u2013 since 2005 we've qualified for every major championship at every level and we've reached either the quarter- or semi-finals of every single competition. This summer is the realisation of the long-term vision that she had way back in 2004-2005. So we're on track.\" Still, the Everton manager is not naive about the lack of acknowledgement Powell has received. \"People only really hear when you win something but we know we've been close for three years. Now we're in touching distance.\" Should England's women defeat Germany, the six-times European champions, Powell may finally receive her just deserts. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2009.
