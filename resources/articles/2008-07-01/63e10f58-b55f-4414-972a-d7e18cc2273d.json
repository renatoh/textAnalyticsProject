Murray and Huber have not yet attracted the attention that the British doubles specialist got last year when he and Jelena Jankovic giggled and flirted their way to the title, but their respective doubles skills are such that there is every chance that Murray may again find himself in the latter stages of the Wimbledon mixed doubles tournament. \"Jamie was on fire today,\" said Huber. \"I think how you judge your partner is how you feel if you were facing them on the other side of the net. I definitely don't want to play against him so it's better for me to play with him. He's a lot more laid back than me but that's what I need because I'm pretty highly strung. Because he's laid back he probably needs somebody to get him in gear.\" \"I enjoy being out there and playing mixed with Liezel, especially when we keep winning matches,\" added Murray. \"I've got a partner here who plays very, very well at the net which a lot of the girls don't do and that helps on grass. It's a good surface to play on.\" Though Huber is happily married and seems unlikely to flutter her eyelashes at 22-year-old Murray quite as often as Jankovic does, she does approve of his neat new haircut. \"I think he looks quite handsome, which is a bit embarrassing,\" said 31-year-old Huber. \"I told him it took years off his age but the problem is that now I realise how young he really is!\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
