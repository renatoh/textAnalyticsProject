The Russian president also used the interview with the Financial Times to claim that the election of Donald Trump as US president and the rise of nationalist-populist movements in Europe signaled the death of liberal policies in the west. \u201c[Liberals] cannot simply dictate anything to anyone just like they have been attempting to do over the recent decades,\u201d he said. \u201cThe liberal idea has become obsolete. It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population.\u201d The claims brought a short response from European council president Donald Tusk at the G20 summit in Osaka on Friday. \u201cI strongly disagree with the main argument that liberalism is obsolete. Whoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete, also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us in Europe, these are and will remain essential and vibrant values. What I find really obsolete are: authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs. Even if sometimes they may seem effective.\u201d On the Skripals, Putin told the FT in an interview at the Kremlin that: \u201cAll this fuss about spies and counterspies is not worth interstate relations. This spy story, as we say here, is not worth 5 kopecks. \u201cI think Russia and UK are both interested in fully restoring our relations \u2013 at least I hope a few preliminary steps will be taken.\u201d Bilateral ties between Britain and Russia plummeted to a post-Cold War low last year when London accused Moscow of the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury. The Kremlin denies sending GRU military intelligence agents to Britain to carry out the attack, which triggered scores of diplomatic expulsions between Moscow and western countries. \u201cThe average person listens and says \u2018who are these Skripals?\u2019\u201d Putin said. \u201cTreason is the gravest crime possible and traitors must be punished. I am not saying that the Salisbury incident is the way to do it \u2026 but traitors must be punished.\u201d Putin has previously called Skripal a \u201cscumbag.\u201d The G20 summit takes place in Osaka on Friday and Saturday. May\u2019s spokesman has said she will use the meeting with Putin to ensure that Britain\u2019s stance on \u201cRussia\u2019s wider pattern of malign behaviour\u201d has been fully grasped by the Kremlin. Putin described German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to allow more than a million refugees \u2013 most of whom were fleeing the war in Syria \u2013 into Germany as a \u201ccardinal mistake\u201d. In contrast, he was full of praise for Trump\u2019s attempts to prevent migrants from entering the US from Mexico. \u201cThis liberal idea presupposes that nothing needs to be done. That migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants have to be protected.\u201d Putin also tried to defend Russia\u2019s record on LGBT+ rights. \u201cI am not trying to insult anyone because we have been condemned for our alleged homophobia. But we have no problem with LGBT persons. God forbid, let them live as they wish,\u201d Putin said. \u201cBut some things do appear excessive to us. They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles.\u201d Moscow has been criticised internationally for its so-called anti-gay propaganda law, which bars the promotion of \u201cnon-traditional sexual relations\u201d to children. Human rights groups say the law, which Putin approved in 2013, has sparked a spike in homophobic violence. A UN panel ruled last year that the law was in violation of a legally binding international treaty on human rights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
