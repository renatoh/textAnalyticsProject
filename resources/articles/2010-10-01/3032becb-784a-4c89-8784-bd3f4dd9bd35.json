Even in his native Germany few people had heard of him before he won his first major, the US PGA Championship at Whistling Straits in August. That whetted the nation's appetite for a new sporting hero, and the German media have turned their attention to the man they call a giant. Golf is making the front pages of the major newspapers for the first time in years. \"At the beginning of this year no one had heard of him,\" says Henning Feindt, sports writer for Bild, Germany's biggest selling newspaper. \"But after he won the PGA Championship and then, even more, the Ryder Cup, we began to take an interest in him. Normally we don't write anything about golf in our paper, it's all soccer and Formula One. But with Kaymer it's like a star has risen, a new sports hero for Germany. We call him Golf Gigante \u2013 golf giant.\" After the PGA win Bild put Kaymer on the front page \u2013 with his American girlfriend, Alison Micheletti, a student \u2013 and across the Atlantic he was also big news as he featured in Sports Illustrated and was invited to open the Nasdaq stock market on Wall Street. Florian Bruhns, the chief executive of Germany's 2018 Ryder Cup bid, called Kaymer's PGA win \"like winning the lottery\" for German golf. There is every chance Kaymer will be on the front pages again in two weeks' time, when he could replace Tiger Woods as the world's No1 player. Woods has been at the top for five years but his decline was anticipated, given the way the rankings work and his long absences and loss of form. The name of his possible successor certainly was not. Lee Westwood is still the most likely candidate to displace Woods but Kaymer, who did not win a tournament until 2008, has climbed the rankings with three successive victories. Should he finish in the top two at the Andalucia Masters in Valderrama, which finishes on 31 October, the day the new rankings are announced, he will overtake Woods, Westwood and Phil Mickelson to become the second German, after Bernard Langer more than 20 years ago, to be the world's No1. Such an achievement would cap off a remarkable year for the 25-year-old who followed that first major two months ago by making his Ryder Cup debut soon afterwards. Kaymer finished on the winning side, losing in the singles but winning 2\u00bd points from three as a partner to Westwood and Ian Poulter in the foursomes and fourballs. Europe's top earner this year, with \u00a32.7m, is also the first professional to clinch a hat-trick of Tour victories \u2013 the PGA, the Dutch Open in September and the Alfred Dunhill last week \u2013 since Woods in 2006, and the first European to do so since Nick Faldo in 1989. But for a go-karting accident, Kaymer might have been No1 on this side of the Atlantic last year. By August 2009 he was clear leader in the season-ending Race to Dubai but lost all chance of winning the \u00a31.3m prize when he broke three bones in his foot. \"It happened in Phoenix,\" Kaymer says. \"I went to the go-kart track with a few guys. The guy behind me pushed me at full power into the guy in front. My foot was flipped back. \"I can't really remember much because the pain was insane. I broke three bones and my big toe was bent under the others so they had to rebreak it and set it.\" Kaymer missed two months of competition, returning to the Tour in the final stages of the season to finish third. Kaymer turned professional in 2005, making it on to the European Tour within a year, and winning for the first time in the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship early in 2008. That kind of ascent is comparable to Michael Schumacher, who became world champion within three years of turning professional. Throughout much of that period Kaymer's mother, Rina, was stricken by cancer, and her son memorably broke down in tears on winning his second big title, the BMW International Open, in Munich, in June 2008. He dedicated that victory to Rina, presenting the trophy to her in the hospital. Two weeks later she died. \"I do think of her,\" he says. \"In ways that I can't explain, she helps me.\" Kaymer admits that he has surpassed his own expectations. \"It was very fast,\" he says of his rise to No4 in the world. \"I don't think you can plan anything like this. We all do our best to make it happen but, well, surprised is maybe the wrong word, but I did not expect my first major so quickly.\" What about becoming No1? \"Right now I am just focusing on winning the Race to Dubai. With last year panning out the way it did it is very important for me to win this year.\" Bernhard Langer was the last German to boost the game domestically, when he topped the world rankings in 1986. But Langer's success was overshadowed by a then 17-year-old Boris Becker winning Wimbledon in 1985 and 1986, and sending Germany \"tennis crazy\" as parents registered their children to take up the sport at local clubs. Now, Germany hopes Kaymer will give golf a new lease of life. \"We have a new hero,\" Feindt says, \"and we hope he can create a golf boom. He's young, he's successful, he's good looking, he's educated, he has a nice story behind him. Everyone likes him here.\" More than 600,000 Germans are registered in clubs across the country, but the sport is still seen as an elitist and, crucially, recreational sport, rather than one that attracts live spectators or TV viewers. When Kaymer plays overseas he has no more than a handful of German fans following him on the course: a hard core of 10-15 witnessed his victory at Whistling Straits. Following golf in Germany is not straightforward, as the major tournaments are all shown on Sky, which is far less popular than it is in the UK. In the circumstances it is remarkable that Kaymer took up golf. His older brother, Philip, says their father, Horst, always played but it was only when a club opened near the family home in Mettmann, east of Dusseldorf, that he and Martin, then 10, and his mother began taking lessons. \"Because it was so close, my brother and I were there almost every day,\" Philip says. \"There was always somebody to practise with or compete against. That was a great time and probably the reason why all of us progressed very fast.\" The whole family caught the bug and Kaymer remembers skipping school when the Masters was on, so he could stay home and watch it on television. His hero was not the two-time Masters winner Langer, but Ernie Els. \"I have just always very much liked his demeanour on the course, as well as his swing,\" Kaymer says. \"His tempo is just amazing.\" By the age of 15 Kaymer was playing off scratch. Kaymer also played football, and was a talented striker for the youth side of Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf. He is a keen fan of FC K\u00f6ln carrying a monogrammed towel of Die Geissb\u00f6cke (the billygoats) in his golf bag. But choosing golf over football was an easy decision. \"The beautiful thing about golf is that you don't have to say so much to your team-mates or your trainer,\" he says. \"I like my own space and time. I can spend hours on the course in complete solitude.\" Some wondered if Kaymer's love of solitude explained his performance at the Ryder Cup: solid, but not dazzling. Is he, like Woods, more of an individual than a team player? Kaymer does not directly answer the question. \"I am still trying to sum up the Ryder Cup experience. It was like nothing else. Perhaps a bit naively I thought that my Valhalla experience [when he was invited by Faldo to observe the competition in 2008] would have prepared me even more. I am happy I went to Valhalla but I am not sure anything can prepare you for what it is like to actually play your first Ryder Cup. It is definitely different than playing as an individual, but I loved every second of it. The emotions that are flowing all around the arena are just indescribable.\" Kaymer is seen as level-headed, unaffected by success and uninterested in celebrity. \"I'm a pretty normal guy. If you know the Germans, most of the people in the world think that they are boring people. I think I'm not boring, but I'm not like a crazy, crazy guy. I'm how you see me on the course.\" On the Sunday before the Ryder Cup Kaymer spent the day practising at his home club, Hummelbachaue \u2013 no security needed, no hangers-on, just happily saying hello to everyone who wished him good luck. When he won the PGA Championship he celebrated with close friends \"late that night in a McDonald's somewhere between Whistling Straits and Chicago airport. It was just perfect.\" When it came to choosing an agent Kaymer shunned the usual big-name options and went with the Swedish company Sportyard, who also look after Henrik Stenson and Robert Karlsson. Why Swedish? \"They work hard, are laid-back, quiet and that suits me,\" Kaymer says. He has been with the same coach, Gunter Kessler, for 12 years. Kessler refuses to succumb to the clamour surrounding his protege. \"When [Martin] began taking lessons from me at the age of 12, he didn't stand out among his peers right away,\" Kessler says, \"and we certainly had no reason to expect that he would one day become one of the world's finest players. But, from the very beginning, we did notice that he worked harder than the others.\" The two have a close bond, even when Kaymer is away practising at his US base in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he owns a modest apartment. He sends videos of his practice sessions back to Germany as he seeks to perfect his draw. \"Praise doesn't shake him. He doesn't believe in the hype,\" Kessler says. \"The people in his corner know when to offer praise and when not. We don't have to get ahead of ourselves.\" In response to his name being mentioned in the same breath as Schumacher or Becker, Kaymer says: \"Keep in mind that I have really only been out here for four years. To be compared to legends, sporting heroes, is flattering but still a bit hard to accept.\" Kessler says Kaymer is typically German in his modesty. Inevitably, questions of \"teutonic efficiency\" tend to pop up at most press conferences. Do the stereotypes irritate him? \"Not really. I am proud of my heritage and I choose to see that trait as something positive. It certainly has helped me.\" A perfectionist, Kaymer practises yoga to improve his golf technique. \"He is always thinking a lot about his golf and different ways how to improve his game,\" says his brother Philip, who gave up a career in golf to caddy for his younger brother in the early years. The two still play together when Kaymer is at home. \"Our father told us that we should hit the driver without tees to become more comfortable in tournaments. Martin still does a lot of such things like playing practice rounds without woods, the next round without wedges, the next one just with odd-numbered irons and the next one with even-numbered irons. That helps to imagine and create new shots, get a feeling for different situations, hit irons weaker or stronger than normal. It broadens your range of shots.\" Langer is an avowed fan, but he says Kaymer's game is about more than just technical brilliance. \"He's very aggressive and smart, like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. He has a great swing, but more than that, he has a great head on his shoulders. He has a much older head than his age might let you know. He doesn't force things, doesn't get too upset and won't let a bogey ruin his day. He's the total package.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
