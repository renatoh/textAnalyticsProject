It is beautiful to watch, certainly, but difficult to control when passions are roused, as we have seen in Nottingham over the past few days. Still, for all the conflict, it was the high-art moments, the heroics and stirring memories of the second Test that outnumbered the bad, as is usually the case. Ian Bell's century, his best, towered above the momentary lapse that led to the run-out that ultimately was not. Stuart Broad and Tim Bresnan were hugely impressive with bat and ball, as was Matt Prior with bat and gloves. Kevin Pietersen came to life again. The mood was strong, the smiles wide. India, meanwhile, were desperately poor in the face of excellence, with a couple of exceptions \u2013 Praveen Kumar is a rare mix of light-hearted and try\u2011till\u2011you\u2011drop commitment, Sachin Tendulkar is Sachin Tendulkar \u2013 and deserved to lose the match and, as may be, their standing as world No1 team. That will happen on 22 August as long as England, 2\u20110 up, take the series by two clear matches. A one\u2011match margin would elevate them above South Africa, although any sane analyst recognises these niceties as a nonsense. At present England, who won the Ashes in Australia and have so far mastered India, must be seen as the best in the world. England showed resilience \u2013 they could easily have collapsed at 124 for eight on the first day before Broad and Graeme Swann turned the match on its head \u2013 as well as conviction, and that has not always been the case. At Lord's there were times in nearly every innings when they might have capitulated but did not. Under Andy Flower, following the contribution of his fellow Zimbabwean Duncan Fletcher, England have replaced complacency and resignation with steel. But these increasingly hard-nosed and consistently successful cricketers should not get ahead of themselves. While they are almost certainly about to replace India at the summit of Test cricket, staying there will be a challenge they have not faced since the International Cricket Council introduced the rankings eight years ago. Either they are at the start of an adventure that could inspire the sort of growth hoped for but never quite delivered after the 2005 Ashes triumph or they are burglars briefly invading the manor house. India have been No1 for 19 months. Before that South Africa reigned for a mere four. And, for those who have forgotten, it was Australia who dominated between June 2003 and July 2009 \u2013 74 months. To establish that sort of hegemony requires more than runs and wickets. It demands attitude. England have the swagger and the knowing look certainly and that, as the West Indians and the Australians demonstrated during their ruthless reigns, is how to get the job done because cricket is a teapot of boiling, psychological pressure. Who could forget how Shane Warne destroyed the career of Daryll Cullinan, with his mouth as much as his fingers. Recall what Dennis Lillee did to Dennis Amiss's Test average. His glare, the one\u2011finger wipe of his brow, the drooping, outlaw moustache were vital aids to his tormenting of the England batsman, and many others. Curtly \"speak to no man\" Ambrose destroyed most of his adversaries with his brooding mien and steepling pace. And, decent as was the decision of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, left, to recall Bell on Sunday after he had been legitimately but clumsily dismissed, the India captain's lack of hardness was laid bare on the fourth morning, the most revealing session of the Test and series. As England's lower order thrashed to stretch the lead way beyond 400, India's attack gave up. Dhoni was clueless. His team flailed like underpaid sparring partners. The sight of Suresh Raina sending down his long-hops to a grateful Broad invited Warne to deride them as \"throwdowns\". A Test match had momentarily ceased to be a contest. After Broad was run out for 44 he banged his bat against his pads all the way back to the dressing room. That was good to see. For all his petulancehe cares. There were easy runs for the taking and he missed out. Yet there are dangers ahead, as England grow into their new status. When Kumar Sangakkara delivered the Cowdrey lecture at Lord's last month, the first Sri Lankan to be invited to do so, he spoke with such eloquence about the spirit of cricket that his message was still powerfully resonant in the turmoil that enveloped Trent Bridge this week. As the antagonists involved in the Bell-Dhoni flap faltered between expedience and doing the right thing, and the experts sought to put the matter into context on the hoof, Sangakkara's supplication that cricket uphold, \"integrity, transparency, commitment and discipline\" struck an echoing note. It is England's responsibility to rule, for as long as their talent allows, with a bit of swagger but respecting those verities, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
