Adhering to the journalistic convention \"If you haven't got anything to write about, make a list\", it purports to identify the 50 coolest people in rock'n'roll. We'll cut to the chase and tell you that number one is Jack White, baby-faced howler from The White Stripes. The other 49 coolsters are so cool that nobody has ever heard of them - Marcie Bolen of the Von Bondies, Nick Pankhurst of The Beatings - which is probably the point. But the main reason I mention it is to draw attention to the piece's opening essay, 20 Commandments of Cool. It's my pleasure to share some of them with you: \"We want to be near them all the time and to do things for them. Even though they scare us.\" \"Everything they say seems to be enigmatic, and their silences are even more enigmatic.\" \"They don't just define the era they live in, they ARE the era.\" \"We live vicariously by their every exploit and wish in our darkest heart of hearts for tragedy to befall them.\" If only there were room to print them all. Anyone else want to join the queue to kiss their enigmatic, era-defining asses? NME news The White Stripes official site \u00b7 Kurt Cobain's much babbled-about Journals hits the shops this week, and some say it could become the top-selling rock book of all time. Waterstone's predicts sales of 100,000 by Christmas, which would eclipse previous bestsellers such as the Manic Street Preachers' biog, Everything, by about 80,000. It's rare for a rock book to sell outside of its core market; if Journals meets its target it will back up Q magazine's slightly crazed assertion that Cobain is still the \"fifth most influential person\" in music.

Despite achieving their first number one single, Freak Like Me, by heavily sampling a Gary Numan track, Sugababes had never actually met the venerable gothlord until he recently presented them with the Q Award for best single. On the Record observed this meeting of minds: Sugababes in their Topshop belly-button jewellery, Numan in alienated black, and neither party having the slightest idea what to say to the other. Next time, sir, just serenade the little ladies with Me! I Disconnect From You.

Rumour has it that money, not a supposed \"conflict of interest\", is what provoked former songwriting partner Guy Chambers' huffy departure last month. The official story is that the Robster wanted Chambers to work for him exclusively and sacked him when he refused. But it has been suggested that Chambers requested a signing-on fee in the region of \u00a35m in return for devoting himself solely to Williams, and, prudent Northerner that he is, the singer told him to take a hike.

If only Michael Eavis would put the wind up a few hippies and put Gareth Gates on the Pyramid Stage.
