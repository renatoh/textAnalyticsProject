A black monk stands, eyes closed, in silent reverie, his entire body a black pillar as if he were made of ash. This is one of three figures of the apocalypse, on the scale of real people, who just stand there. For a moment out of the corner of your eye you think they move: the monk, a skeletal white doctor, and a diabolical red art dealer, a cloven hoof under his neat trouser leg. These are modern incarnations of the Knight, Death and the Devil, engraved in the 16th century by D\u00fcrer. German medieval nightmares come to life in these cool white galleries, as the possibility of another world is broached through painstaking modelling. Fritsch has been making lifelike recreations of figures from dream and myth since the 1980s. A giant mouse perches on the chest of a sleeping man; it's funny yet nasty, the creature's weight, as it sits on his lungs, panic-inducing. Equally daunting is the life-size figure of an elephant, its vast feet poised on a plinth above you, its head almost touching the ceiling. Like all Fritsch's models, it's made of polyester. It's the phantom weight of the non-elephant that worries. Fritsch is best when she's crudest. Row on row of identical black-shirted men sit passively at a table decorated with a pattern recalling the tablecloth in Holbein's The Ambassadors. The men - or one man repeating himself - might be a fascist cell. Her Ghost and Pool of Blood presents a faceless figure draped in a sheet with a translucent red plastic blotch on the floor, shining like a pool of bloody matter. And yet a lot of this work is bloodless. Fritsch too cunningly fuses two opposed currents in German art since 1960 - the expressive strain epitomised by Joseph Beuys and the minimalist sublime of Gerhard Richter. Fritsch takes the animals and demons of German romanticism and its medieval roots and treats them like a minimalist building block. It's often too contrived, slightly dry in its quotations. But the gloom stays with you. Child with Poodles is another reference to German art - to the baby in the meadow painted by the romantic Philipp Otto Runge. Fritsch's baby is surrounded by concentric rings of black poodles, at once cute and murderous. It's a hilarious, repellent image, with a quality this artist could use more of - bad taste. \u0095 Until December 9. Details: 020-7887 8008.
