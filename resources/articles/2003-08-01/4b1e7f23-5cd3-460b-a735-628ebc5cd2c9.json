A second offer of about \u00a36.5m from Rovers for the 25-year-old midfielder was rejected yesterday, with the Scottish champions holding out for nearer \u00a38m, and with last night's 2-1 win at FC Copenhagen qualifying them for Europe's premier competition they will make an attempt to keep him. \"We have made two bids for Ferguson, so it is fair to say we are still very keen to sign the player,\" said Blackburn's chief executive John Williams. \"But our opinion remains that Rangers' valuation of Ferguson is still very high and we are a long way apart at this stage. \"Barry is a player Graeme [Souness] likes a lot, but Rangers are doing a very good job at holding on to him. With the timescale, I am not optimistic about the transfer at this stage but we have not closed the door by any means.\" Everton, whose urgent need for midfield reinforcements will see them break their rigid \u00a320,000-a-week ceiling to improve on Ferguson's \u00a327,000-a-week wages at Rangers, surprisingly entered the fray yesterday. Initially been put off by the figures involved, they lodged an initial offer worth about \u00a36m and, with that promptly rejected, an improved bid can be expected. \"We have made a substantial offer for Barry Ferguson,\" confirmed Everton's deputy chairman Bill Kenwright. \"We are aware other clubs have been in pursuit of him much earlier, but we want to support our manager as much as we can - and that is what we are doing.\" The manager David Moyes said: \"The situation changes hour by hour. We're looking at several players but I'm not sure whether I'll get any before the deadline.\" Sunderland's Claudio Reyna, available for \u00a32.5m and delaying a move to Fulham, remains Moyes's first-choice back-up signing although Manchester City last night made a late bid to sign the midfielder from under the noses of the London club. Kevin Keegan, the City manager, is willing to pay about \u00a32m for the 30-year-old. Blackburn have completed the season-long loan signing of Liverpool's defender Markus Babbel for a nominal fee. But the German international cannot make his debut until September 20 because he has two games left of a four-match ban. Steve Marlet is joining Marseille, subject to a medical today, on loan until the end of the season, when the French club have an option to buy him. Fifa last night confirmed that Fulham missed yesterday's deadline for paying Lyon the final \u00a32.5m instalment for the striker, who came to London two years ago for \u00a311.5m. Portsmouth have taken Chelsea's midfielder Alexei Smertin on loan for the rest of the season, only two days after the Russian captain signed for Roman Abramovich's club for \u00a33.5m. Chelsea had said they bought him as an \"investment for the future\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
