Having apologised in 2009 for his own past errors he also purged flagrant evidence of homophobia among the party's election candidates this year and voted for Labour's new Equality Act. Cameron did more than chatter over white wine and canapes in the Downing Street drawing room. He confirmed a raft of promises made by his equality ministers, the home secretary, Teresa May, and her Lib Dem sidekick, Lynne Featherstone, to remove historic convictions for consensual gay sex, offer a fairer deal to those seeking asylum on gender issues and work to end homophobic bullying in school. This is progress, reflecting real change within Conservative culture. There are at least 10 gay or lesbian Tory MPs in the new parliament and several gay ministers. It is a far cry from the 80s when the sexuality of ambitious gay Tories was privately accepted in Margaret Thatcher's entourage while publicly they stayed in the closet. But not all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) activists are willing to accept the Tory conversion \u2013 or Cameron's sincerity. Labour LGBTs seem happy to encourage doubters. They point to Chris Grayling's defence of Christian couples' right to deny B&amp;B to gays (he was actually seeking to distinguish between public hotels and private homes). Nor was Outrage's Peter Tatchell invited to No 10, though Gordon Brown didn't invite him either. There is also the David Laws affair which divided the gay commentariat. Was the case one of fraud, for which a holier-than-thou Lib Dem minister was rightly forced to resign? Was it about Laws's legitimate desire to protect his privacy or \u2013 as some critics said \u2013 about his feeble lack of courage in not outing himself now it is safe to do so? Some gay analysts see that split as a wholesome sign that their community no longer feels the need to close ranks because it is no longer so beleaguered. That upbeat perspective, much disputed, suggests that Cameron's promises were so modest because they address the tail end of a rights agenda which has been largely won, step-by-step, in the 43 years since the ground-breaking Sexual Offences Act of 1967. Polls confirm a sharp turn towards tolerance among voters. But one of Cameron's more cautious promises to Gay Pride highlighted a residual division. Just as some gays say they are drawn to a low-tax, small-state, libertarian agenda, the strand of social conservatism which still rejects them is usually rooted in heart-felt religious belief. In multicultural Britain most faiths feel the same way. Cameron's ministers are committed to work with faith groups to find practical ways of resolving the new power in the Equality Act which allows but does not compel churches to host civil partnership ceremonies, as they were not allowed to do when the so-called \"gay marriage\" act was passed in 2004. Ministers and Labour ex-ministers know it remains tricky territory which churches do not like. But it is also a measure of the pace of change that has left Lord Tebbit stranded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
