According to The Times, Dyke intends to introduce stringent regulations that could cut the number of players from outside the EU by 50%. They include altering the present rules that stipulate players must have appeared in at least 75% of a nation\u2019s competitive fixtures over two years if they are ranked inside Fifa\u2019s top 75 to the top 50, with the required number of games dropping to 30% for countries ranked inside the top 30. Players who cost more than \u00a310m would automatically be granted a work permit. Dyke is hopeful that the new regulations could be introduced for the start of next season, with the proposals due to be submitted to the Home Office by the end of the year. Several signings in the summer transfer window are unlikely to have been granted work permits had the rules been in place for this season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
