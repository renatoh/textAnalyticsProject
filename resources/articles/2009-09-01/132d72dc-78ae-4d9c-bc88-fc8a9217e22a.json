As demonstrated once again in their midweek European commitments, followers of the Glasgow giants may still be preoccupied with points-scoring while fulfilling engagements 1,500 miles apart. The form of neither match, it should be stressed, is likely to cause the participants to trouble the judges at the business end of the respective competitions. But Rangers' 1-1 draw with Stuttgart, in Germany, in the opening game of their Champions League group campaign, was emphatically more impressive than Celtic's torturous 2-1 defeat by Hapoel in Tel Aviv. Indeed, the lamentations among fans of the Parkhead club after the reversal in their first Europa League group match suggest Tony Mowbray is already on probation, just weeks into his first season as successor to Gordon Strachan. The big Englishman seemed remarkably unconcerned by the hostility that appeared to gush in his direction from websites and forums in the wake of a second-half collapse that led to the ultimately meek capitulation of his team, after they had finished a first half of domination with a one-goal lead through Georgios Samaras. He was, instead, more insistent on emphasising that it is his players who are on probation as he goes about fulfilling his pledge to make Celtic in his own image. In outlining his objective, Mowbray was uncommonly candid in his appraisal of his present resources and equally forthright about how long it is likely to take to effect improvement. \"What you need, above all, is a squad you can trust,\" Mowbray said. \"That means one where it doesn't matter, by and large, who's playing and who's not because they are all top players. You have 20 to 24 players who will serve your purposes. \"I inherited a squad who've been mainly successful and who lost a few, including real contributors like Shunsuke Nakamura and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink. But I see my own squad and my own team developing over the next few years. We have a few transfer windows to get through before we get to acquiring the players who will take us anywhere near where we would want to be. \"Where I want to be is where I have the kind of players who can play the way I want to play. So far, we're only through one transfer window and we've brought in a few, but, maybe, I'll have a much better idea by the next window about who should be coming and who should be going. In Tel Aviv, for example, I didn't see a team I'd like to stick a stamp on and say that's the team I want. \"Their retention of the ball is not good enough, certainly not for what's required at a good level in Europe. I would like to have a team who can control matches and take full advantage of that control, week in, week out. At the moment, I'm miles away from what I would consider my ideal.\" Wish fulfilment for Mowbray sounds like an expensive exercise and he is likely to be badgering a famously prudent board of directors at a time when funds are conspicuously more difficult to release than Ronnie Biggs and the Lockerbie bomber. When he talked of a few transfer windows to be got through, he may have needed more than one hand to count them. In this respect, his rival at Ibrox, Walter Smith, has shown extraordinary deftness. Smith seems to have a gift for unearthing players equipped with the hardness of spirit and energetic commitment that comply with his playing style at those times when virtuosity is at a premium. Madjid Bougherra, the marauding central defender who delivered Rangers' equaliser in Stuttgart, would be a prime example. It has left Mowbray playing catch-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
