Maybe it was a naive dream but it has always been my ultimate one and now I\u2019m here I feel so honoured and privileged. \u201cI don\u2019t look back too much on what I achieved as a player, I always prefer to look forward, but obviously I enjoyed my time playing for United and I was quite successful. If I can leave here as a successful manager I\u2019ll be happier still. I think bringing success in the form of trophies to this club and its supporters would count as an even bigger achievement.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r is realistic enough to accept a top-four finish would be a satisfactory outcome this season \u2013 Champions League qualification was looking beyond Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 but said there was still a slim chance of a trophy. That can only mean winning the Champions League, even though Barcelona are United\u2019s quarter-final opponents. \u201cAs long as we are in it we have a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be tough but we have climbed mountains before. The short-term target has to be qualification for next season, though. We have improved greatly in three months and given ourselves a great chance of finishing fourth or even third.\u201d The manager, who has a three-year contract, confirmed there would be signings in the summer, that Mike Phelan and the rest of the coaching staff would be retained, and that he had spoken to Sir Alex Ferguson. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the first phone calls you make if you get this job \u2026 I know perfectly well that Manchester United need to be winning titles and I know we will be successful, but I can\u2019t promise anything overnight. We need to keep improving step by step. I won\u2019t be making any radical changes.\u201d It appears the United hierarchy were not only impressed with Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s ability to win games \u2013 the victory at Tottenham counting heavily in his favour, even before the improbable comeback against Paris Saint-Germain \u2013 but also by his demeanour with the players and mature reaction to defeats. Though the Norwegian was confidently expected to put a smile back on people\u2019s faces at Old Trafford, promote attacking football and project a positive image in press-conference and television interviews, the club has been pleasantly surprised by his ability to command respect from the players and restore a degree of discipline that was slipping away under Mourinho. \u201cTalking to him is just like talking to Sir Alex Ferguson or Rio Ferdinand,\u201d one Old Trafford insider said admiringly. \u201cHe\u2019s been around the club so long he speaks Manchester United; you never need to explain anything to him.\u201d Despite Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s evident popularity the club is still understood to be looking for a director of football to work alongside him, particularly with regard to player recruitment and development, with an appointment possible before next season. Mourinho was vehemently opposed to any such delegation of responsibility. A club that has just appointed its fourth permanent manager since Ferguson stepped down six years ago now feels it might be prudent to appoint someone with a longer-term perspective to provide continuity and monitor the progress of players below first-team level. Asked whether he felt proud, Solskj\u00e6r replied that it was too soon to say. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be here because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted to do. As a striker you always have to be an optimist and I hoped things would work out. I\u2019m not sure proud is the right word though, because we are only at the beginning of something new, the hard work starts here. I want Manchester United to be the hardest-working team in the league and among the fittest. The players know my expectations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
