In India alone an estimated 11 million children are living on the streets with no access to the most basic of living conditions, while in Rwanda 93% of street girls surveyed are reported rape victims. This is not an issue that solely affects developing nations. Last year, in Britain, an estimated 100,000 children ran away from home, 16,000 of whom slept rough, putting themselves in a position of unimaginable danger. We believe that the rights of street children cannot be ignored. It isn't as though they don't have any: the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has been signed and ratified by almost every country in the world, but these rights continue to be ignored. We call for all governments to ensure the rights of street children are recognised and included in policies and legislation. Today, to mark the first International Day for Street Children \u2013 which is being supported and celebrated across the world \u2013 we urge people to join the campaign and bring street children one step closer to accessing their fundamental rights as set out in the UNCRC.
