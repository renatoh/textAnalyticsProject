In a renewed attack on the prime minister, the Labour leader will tell the TUC conference in Brighton that crashing out of the EU will give the Conservatives and their deep-pocketed supporters an opportunity to sell off public services and undermine workers\u2019 rights. Corbyn is also expected to confirm Labour will trigger a general election once the risk of a no-deal Brexit has been removed. He will tell the conference: \u201cJohnson\u2019s reckless no deal would destroy jobs, push up food prices in the shops and cause shortages of everyday medicines that people rely on. \u201cAnd who bears the cost of that? It wouldn\u2019t be Johnson and his wealthy friends. It\u2019s not their livelihoods on the line. It would be the rest of us. \u201cJust as it wasn\u2019t the bankers Boris Johnson still defends who paid the price for the financial crash of 2008, it was tens of millions of people who had nothing to do with it.\u201d Corbyn will claim the Tories want to use a no-deal \u201ccrash\u201d to \u201cpush through policies that benefit them and their super-rich supporters and hurt everyone else \u2013 just as they did after the financial crash\u201d. He will add: \u201cUnder the cover of no deal they will sell off our public services, strip away the regulations that keep us safe and undermine workers\u2019 rights.\u201d Corbyn is also expected to say a no-deal Brexit would be a \u201cTrump-deal Brexit\u201d that would lead to a \u201cone-sided US trade deal negotiated from a position of weakness\u201d. He will add: \u201cIt will put us at the mercy of Trump and the big US corporations itching to get their teeth further into our NHS, sound the death knell for our steel industry, and permanently drive down rights and protections for workers.\u201d Outlining Labour\u2019s strategy over the next few weeks, Corbyn will say the priority is to first prevent a no-deal Brexit and then trigger a general election. He will claim the government is making no real attempt to achieve a deal with the EU. \u201cAmber Rudd\u2019s resignation confirmed that the government is not serious about trying to get a deal in Brussels,\u201d Corbyn will say. \u201cAs the prime minister\u2019s top adviser reportedly said, the negotiations are \u2018a sham\u2019. No-one can trust the word of a prime minister who is threatening to break the law to force through no-deal.\u201d He will also pledge to run a \u201cpeople-powered\u201d election campaign. \u201cA general election is coming. But we won\u2019t allow Johnson to dictate the terms. And I can tell you this: we\u2019re ready for that election. We\u2019re ready to unleash the biggest people-powered campaign we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Corbyn will say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
