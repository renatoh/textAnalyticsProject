At a rally in Mississippi on Friday night, the president crowed over the political demise of an articulate and outspoken rival. Mocking an infamous Vanity Fair interview in which O\u2019Rourke said he was born for the presidency, Trump said: \u201cHe said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven, he came down.\u201d O\u2019Rourke made his announcement in a Medium post and a series of tweets, saying: \u201cOur campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively. In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.\u201d Speaking to supporters in Iowa, he said he made the decision \u201creluctantly\u201d and would stay active in the fight to defeat Trump. \u201cI will be part of this and so will you,\u201d he said. The three-term congressman rose to national prominence with a strong performance in a 2018 US Senate race against the Republican Ted Cruz, a contest he lost narrowly. He parlayed that run into a presidential bid which started strongly, as donors and voters were drawn to his unconventional background and energetic style. Born Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke to a solidly Irish American family, he nonetheless had a Hispanic nickname and a past including arrests and membership of a punk band which helped him stand out in a diverse field. His time in Congress as a rare Texas Democrat, from a border district, was valued and his habit of giving speeches while standing on tables celebrated, before the latter tactic began to be roundly mocked. O\u2019Rourke experienced very public misfires, including the Vanity Fair article and photoshoot and controversy over a joke about his wife, Amy, raising his children without him. Such reverses led to a public apology for his white male privilege but he never made a serious impression on the polls or in the crowded debates. O\u2019Rourke could not match progressive favourites Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders or muster the centrist appeal of Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg. Some of his policies, such as an assault-weapon buyback to stop mass shootings such as that which killed 22 people in his home town in August, were popular with liberals but prompted ferocious criticism, even threats, from Republicans in his home state and on the national stage. En route to a rally in Mississippi which he mistakenly tweeted would be in Louisiana, Trump first mocked O\u2019Rourke in surprisingly muted tones. \u201cOh no,\u201d the president wrote, \u201cBeto just dropped out of race for president despite him saying he was \u2018born for this\u2019. I don\u2019t think so!\u201d He was harsher in front of a crowd, saying: \u201cAnybody who says they were born for this, they\u2019re in trouble. \u201cHe came out of Texas a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be.\u201d O\u2019Rourke thanked volunteers and supporters and said: \u201cLet us continue to fearlessly champion the issues and causes that brought us together. Whether it is ending the epidemic of gun violence or dismantling structural racism or successfully confronting climate change, we will continue to organize and mobilize and act.\u201d He said he would support the Democratic nominee. The frontrunners in the still-unwieldy field are former vice-president Biden, senators Warren and Sanders and Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana. O\u2019Rourke has also trailed Senator Kamala Harris, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and representative Tulsi Gabbard. But he has consistently polled ahead of senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, the pro-impeachment billionaire Tom Steyer and the former federal housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who all remain in the race. Candidates including Warren and Sanders were quick to send O\u2019Rourke on his way with tweeted thanks. Most concentrated on his advocacy for gun control reform. Castro, who attacked O\u2019Rourke on the debate stage on immigration, a key part of the former congressman\u2019s platform, said his opponent \u201cinspired millions of Americans \u2026 and rallied Texans and El Pasoans after the tragedy that struck his hometown\u201d. Harris, whose own campaign has refused to catch fire after a strong start, thanked O\u2019Rourke on Twitter \u201cfor always speaking from the heart. Your passion for your community and conviction to create a future free from gun violence have enriched this campaign and shown us the leader you are.\u201d At 47, O\u2019Rourke seemed to many to have a long political future, perhaps focused on the next Texas US Senate race, against the senior Republican John Cornyn. But on Friday an aide told the New York Times O\u2019Rourke would not mount another run. That perhaps reflected a realisation that the former congressman reached too far too soon. That is certainly a view held by many of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s critics, that as the Daily Beast put it: \u201cReacting to losing to Ted Cruz by running for president is like failing to land a role in a community theatre production and deciding to take your talents to Broadway.\u201d In a statement, the Texas Democratic party chair, Gilberto Hinojosa, called O\u2019Rourke \u201ca fighter, advocate and leader\u201d. \u201cIn the wake of the El Paso shootings,\u201d he said, \u201che made the entire country proud as he focused his campaign on ending gun violence and the rise of white supremacy. We thank him for his service and leadership. He made Texas proud. \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke has done amazing things for the Democratic party in Texas, and we look forward to his future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
