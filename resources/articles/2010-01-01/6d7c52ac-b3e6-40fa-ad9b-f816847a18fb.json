We are still used to hearing it with 20 minutes of music missing, so Valery Gergiev and the London Symphony Orchestra's decision to present it complete cannot be too highly commended. Though the traditional cuts have helped many singers get through the piece, they also fall in some of the most provocative passages, diluting Elektra's violence towards her mother and her repressed sexual feelings towards her sister Chrysothemis. Gergiev's interpretation, though, was by no means ideal. The opening scenes were notably underpaced, and things only gained grip and momentum with Klytemnestra's appearance. Thereafter, the performance's strength often lay in its detail, as Gergiev mined the sinister implications of instrumental solos at points of near stasis, and ratcheted up tensions by emphasising brief but savage harmonic clashes. Orchestrally, much was staggering, though the curious decision to place the chorus in the stalls rather than off-stage wrecked the balance in the closing scenes. Vocally, there were comparable inequalities. We were occasionally conscious of singers familiar with the cut version being score-bound during the restored passages, and of Jeanne-Mich\u00e8le Charbonnet's Elektra being pushed to her limits. But Felicity Palmer touched tragic depths as Clytemnestra, and Angela Denoke was formidable in her depiction of the seething emotions behind Chrysothemis's cool facade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
