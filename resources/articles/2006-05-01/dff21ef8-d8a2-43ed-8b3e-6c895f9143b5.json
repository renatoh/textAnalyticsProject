You've got George Galloway! We've been trying to get him for 20 years, but Big Brother's done it!' A month later, I was chided by a prominent government minister: 'Honestly, how could you? You've made Galloway far more popular in his constituency than he ever was before.' Whichever view is true, the public had never seen a politician so intimately before. This was the best opportunity ever afforded to judge the personality of someone entrusted to represent us. Galloway's adventure coincides nicely with a second study from Professor Stephen Coleman, published by the Hansard Society, as to why fewer and fewer young people are voting. As before, Coleman has used YouGov's online survey to isolate 200 Big Brother fans and investigate their attitudes to organised politics. They all followed the 2004 series closely, half of them voting at some point. In the European elections, held at the same time, far fewer Big Brother fans took part than the national average. Coleman then polled the same people during the 2005 general election. Their level of participation was not as low as some might think, but their disaffection for parliamentary politics was palpable. This malaise affects more than the fans of reality shows - 2001 and 2005 both saw historically low turnouts. The blame for this, argues Coleman, lies far more with politicians and their media coverage than with the voters themselves. In fact, the new generation of voters cared more about global warming than the general election. Even then, they thought voting for a new government was much more important than voting on Big Brother (by 69 to 28 per cent). Indeed, two-thirds thought it their 'duty' to vote and one-third believed it should be made compulsory. Given their sentiments, why aren't more of the younger generation voting? What would persuade them to do so? The Galloway episode, fantastic though it may seem, may point towards an answer. It's widely accepted that, in terms of policy, very little divides our parties. There is nothing to rival the Clause 4 debates of the 1940s and 1950s, tariff reform in 1900, Ireland in the late 19th century, political reform in the 1830s or slavery before that. Coleman reveals that the main factor preventing his respondents voting is not being able to make up their minds between candidates (twice as important as their vote 'making no difference' or being 'too busy' on election day). More than ever, we are left with judging the personalities of the candidates. While paying lip service to 'issues', politicians understand this. Blair's disingenuously regular-guy mode of speech and Cameron's ordinary-man-on-a-bicycle routine are carefully calculated to reveal they are really one of us. But we're not entirely convinced. It is entirely legitimate to regard politics as a popularity contest; after all, what you think of the person you are going to entrust power to for five years is pretty crucial. And, in the close-up age of Big Brother and Heat magazine, our expectations are raised. But with politics, by contrast, Coleman says that we find it difficult to discover what the candidates are really like. Worse, the arms race between aggressive interviewers and spin sultans leaves us confused and disenchanted. Respondents were asked what kind of politician they were most likely to vote for. More than half said a good listener; only 10 per cent said a good talker. This is profound and challenges the conventional wisdom that says politicians should present the policies they believe in. Indeed, we sneer at parties that appear to poll and consult too much. But for young people, involvement in, say, the media is now all about a conversation, where they generate much of the material. The result is that future young political activists will need to be involved in a dialogue. I don't think our politicians have a clue about this novel development. The BBC has; it has just announced a total overhaul of its website to become a beacon of user-generation. Coleman believes that to restore voter turnouts to their historic levels and involve far more younger voters in the process, general elections need to be reinvented. Good idea. Here are a few suggestions. First, introduce online voting as an alternative to the intimidating polling booths. Yes, this is an exercise to make the prospect of voting more attractive, so curb your inclination to condemn the new generation of voters as lazy. Let's do politics in a manner they are comfortable with. Second, we should enforce the introduction of TV debates between party leaders. America has led the way and, more recently, Italy too. This is a simple way to enable us to get closer to their personalities, unmediated by spin. Third, in place of the ghastly party political broadcasts, the BBC should host online party forums in which voters shape a virtual campaign according to their own desires. Finally, we need to find more imaginative ways to scrutinise candidates so we can judge them more easily for what they are. Michael Portillo living with a working-class family, Matthew Parris on the dole and George Galloway in Big Brother should be just the beginning. We have a tradition of strong, personal opinions about our politicians. Look at the cartoons of Gillray, the poems of Pope, the inflammatory tracts of Wilkes and the novels of Dickens. The tragedy of today is that, in place of this passion, we don't much care either way. \u00b7 Peter Bazalgette is chief creative officer of Endemol, producers of Big Brother, and a non-executive director of YouGov."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
