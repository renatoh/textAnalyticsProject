As regular readers will recall, this column repeatedly stated last week that China's sovereign wealth fund was financing Huang's bid. That conviction was based not only on the information received from Huang's people and from among those who are selling the club \u2013 although such assurances were indeed received \u2013 but also from Digger's own experiences. Last Thursday, the day CIC's sale of \u00a3351.4m of Morgan Stanley shares \u2013 exactly the sale price for Liverpool to the nearest decimal place \u2013 was reported here, out of the blue Digger was invited to appear on the Chinese state radio station, CRI. CRI's reporter introduced the interview, broadcast last Friday morning on the Beijing Hour \u2013 its English-language equivalent of Radio Four's Today programme \u2013 by saying: \"Speculation in the British press is mounting that Huang's bid could be backed by the state-owned China Investment Corporation.\" Now the Middle Kingdom may indeed be capitalist, but seldom can its state media be accused of being off\u2011message, and if the politburo does not like the look of the speculation in the British press, then it is easily overlooked. (Or suppressed, as the arrest of ITN's John Ray at the Beijing Olympics demonstrated.) So if Huang gets it together in time for this week's deadline and proves he has the money to bid, Digger will continue to suspect the involvement of China's government somewhere along the line. Lerner learns from losses Martin O'Neill's resignation as Aston Villa manager will not have come as a surprise to those who read football clubs' annual accounts. The US billionaire Randy Lerner has long been held up as a model club owner, but his and O'Neill's stewardship has not been allied to prudent financial husbandry. In the 12 months to May last year Villa lost \u00a330.1m after wages accounted for almost 84% of the club's \u00a384.2m turnover. That wage bill did not even feature Stewart Downing, Richard Dunne, James Collins or Stephen Warnock \u2013 none of whom is paid peanuts. Over the course of those 12 months Lerner pumped in \u00a3220m of fresh capital into the club's parent, on top of the near-\u00a3140m he had already injected. Without the success to justify the investment, something at some point had to give. Whether that might be a demand from Lerner to shrink the wage bill or to recover funds from the transfer market, O'Neill's departure seems inevitably to have flowed from those numbers. Costly French philosophy As Ars\u00e8ne Wenger admits this season could be his last at Arsenal the club has received feedback from its most influential fans that more than half believe his \"football philosophy\" may have cost the club success. The Arsenal Supporters Trust, a shareholder group, has published the outcomes of its membership survey, the results of which were requested by the club while it conducted a strategic review of its activities. And 53% of respondents answered yes to the following question: \"Do you think Wenger's football philosophy takes too much precedence over the objective of winning trophies?\" Counteracting that were the 43% of respondents who answered no. But if the last year of Wenger's contract becomes Arsenal's sixth successive season without silverware and the club should seek to change his ways then he will be another manager to part company with his employer. For the man is not for turning. Saints keep it in-house Markus Liebherr, the billionaire owner of Southampton, runs a tight ship at his industrial group of the same name. It states: \"To maintain the high-quality standards with which its products have to comply, Liebherr attaches great importance to in-house control of key technologies\". It is a modus operandi that has now been adopted at Southampton, but Digger cannot help but think it is being taken too far. The League One club has restricted match-day photography to in-house snappers, preventing outside organisations from taking pictures. The club's photos are distributed \"on normal commercial terms\" \u2013 ie, pay up or go without \u2013 and after Saints lost 1-0 at home to Plymouth Argyle in their opening game on Saturday there cannot have been many takers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
