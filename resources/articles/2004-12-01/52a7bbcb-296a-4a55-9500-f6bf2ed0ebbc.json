Facing stiff competition from the no-frills airlines, package-holiday pioneer Thomas Cook (0870 1609192; flexibletrips.com) has decided to sell low-cost flights as part of a new flexible holiday programme. Customers will be able to tailormake holidays of any duration, putting together flights with airlines such as Easyjet and Ryanair with their choice of hotel accommodation, but with the peace of mind of booking via an established tour operator. Thomas Cook claims there will be no mark-up on the flights, but that passengers will be covered by its Atol and Abta bonds in the event of an airline going bust - protection which they do not get by booking directly with the airlines. A growing trend for independent travel, often booked online, has forced the big travel firms to re-evaluate how they work. Last month, a Mintel survey predicted a five per cent decline in package holidays taken by UK travellers over the next five years. In October, Thomson Holidays (0870 550 2555; thomsonhotelsandapartments.co.uk) released 2,000 of its hotel rooms and apartments from packages to sell as 'accommodation only' with rooms from as little as \u00a31 a night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
