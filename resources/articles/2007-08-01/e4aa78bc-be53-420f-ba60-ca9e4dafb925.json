The public reason is that the treaty is not the same as the constitution - on which a referendum was promised - that was supposed to supersede all previous EU deals, but which was killed off by hostile voters in France and the Netherlands. While much of the constitution has been salvaged, the new treaty is a more modest affair, one in a sequence of amendments to EU practice. Those amendments have never, in the past, been put to a public vote. The private reason is that the government would campaign for a 'yes' vote and probably lose. It is precisely because Gordon Brown can't admit his fear of defeat that the Tories are pressing so hard for a plebiscite. They know that the official argument distinguishing a constitution from an 'amending treaty', while technically accurate, means precious little to a public deeply suspicious of everything signed in Brussels. The more the government is forced to parrot that line, the more it looks as if it has something to hide. But while there are easy points to be scored, leading a charge against the EU is dangerous for the Conservatives. They have to tread a line between standing up for British interests and retreating to an anti-European comfort zone. They want applause from sensible sceptics for talking about democratic accountability, but their loudest cheers inevitably come from xenophobes who think Brussels is a conspiracy against Old Albion. The Tories have not said how they would change the treaty to make it acceptable. And if they think no treaty would be acceptable, they might as well be lobbying to quit the EU completely. Any agreement on co-operation between governments - membership of Nato or the World Trade Organisation, for example - requires some compromise on national autonomy. The new EU treaty is no different, although the compromises are smaller, as former Europe Minister Denis MacShane argues on these pages, than the Tories are making out. They are certainly no bigger than those made in the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties. The Prime Ministers who signed those deals considered their passage through Parliament to be a sufficient seal of democratic approval. The problem is that, rather than be honest in public about the pros and cons of compromising sovereignty for international co-operation, British governments have been consistently cowardly. They don't make the political case for co-operation - that united in a single market, Europe has enjoyed freedom and prosperity unparalleled in its history, while divided, it lurched from insular nationalism to military rivalry to epic bloodshed. Instead, they pretend that the arguments and the treaties are purely technical and economic. No one believes that, and the result is ill-informed scepticism. Now the government is at it again, hoping that the debate over this treaty will just go away. Perhaps it will. If the Tories overplay their hand and sound too much like Ukip, people might get impatient for discussion of policies that more directly affect their lives. The Conservatives' electoral record as a single-issue Europhobic party is not good. But the underlying public distrust will not have diminished. The moment when a government has to ask the British people whether or not they are on board with the European project will only have been deferred. The fact that Gordon Brown is afraid to ask that question is testimony to a systematic failure of courage and conviction in every government, Labour and Tory, for the last 30 years. They all understood political reality - that the EU requires compromise on sovereignty but serves Britain's national interest none the less - and failed to admit it to the public."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
