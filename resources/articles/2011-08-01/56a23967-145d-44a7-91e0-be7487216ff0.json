I miss the feeling of awe that accompanied the whoop of a female punk in 1989, her giggle and spit as she chucked chips around a suburban Wimpy, the misplaced lust over a girl in the sixth form who'd totally mastered Sun-In. I miss the pure admiration and singular obsession, the raw validity of a teenage girl crush. For us as children, girl crushes gave us a safe dress rehearsal for romance. As we get older, our girl crushes are often crushed. It's no longer acceptable to platonically obsess over women when you get to our age \u2013 instead we're encouraged to think of them as \"mentors\", which feels uncomfortably formal. Forced. Or worse, we're expected to befriend them, thereby learning the truth about their insecurities and seeing how grumpy they get when hungry, and, while we still think they're fairly amazing, some of the gloss of the crush becomes inevitably tarnished. Aged 13 I immersed myself in the wonderful teen drama series My So-Called Life, which illustrated the painful, fabulously female truth of the crush \u2013 the hair dye, the fragile intimacy, the things unsaid. There's something very pure about the teenage-girl crush, and something quite liberating about admitting the adult kind. My first grown-up crush, I think, was on a girl at art college \u2013 a crush spoilt when she became my best friend (10 years and counting) and I was introduced to all her levels of bossiness, filed as though guest towels, some saved for \"best\". In Britain the Gentlewoman magazine (with Adele as its last cover star) caters for a need to crush \u2013 it's full of interviews with women who other women look up to. And this week in America a similar project is beginning \u2013 Thessaly La Force and Jenna Wortham (from the Paris Review and New York Times, respectively) announced the launch of Girl Crush Zine, their celebration of girl on (clothed) girl love. Wortham's girl crushes include Kathleen Hanna and Joan Jett; La Force loves Sofia Coppola and Jennifer Egan. Their blog overflows with admiration for crushees including chef Alice Waters and jailbird Lindsay Lohan (circa Mean Girls, obviously) \u2013 the only thing that connects them being their liquid brilliance. While teenage crushes can hang on the ability to draw a really accurate picture of Leonardo DiCaprio on a homework diary, adult ones are more rare, more nuanced. To qualify as crushable, the woman must, I think, appear to really like other women. Too often, impressive women seem to buy into the idea that other women are their competition rather than their allies. Things to climb over like garden walls instead of people whose qualities can be admired rather than envied. We're trained this way. Having seen that fewer women run stuff than men, we find ourselves plotting to overthrow the women ahead of us rather than adjust the stuff itself to make room for more women. We're mad. Anyway. To qualify as crushable, women must appear to really like other women. They must be smart. They must be stylish. They must be funny. They must be cool. They must be talented. They must never know that they are crushed on, or else something will break, some delicate membrane of power. They must appear to be in control of most things \u2013 their relationships, definitely; their career, definitely; their wardrobe, preferably. They must inspire a nervousness in us. They must inspire us. They must have a really honking, polyphonic laugh, a bit like an excited horse. Crushes are important, too, because they bypass jealousy. And because, unlike a romantic relationship, when your crush knows nothing about your pretend friendship (your pretendship \u2013 your mile-long pulses of admiration), you needn't ever break up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
