Yesterday the world No1 rattled up his 500th victory, passing $30m in prize money in the process, with Spain's David Ferrer, ranked a respectable 16th in the world, drowning 6-4, 6-0 after a futile thrash against the inevitable in the opening games of their Masters series quarter-final. This was the sixth time Ferrer, who has a good pedigree on clay, had lost to Federer - and all without winning a set. \"I finally felt the ball really good from the baseline and it was easy to play aggressively,\" said the Swiss. Everything in Federer's Mediterranean garden was in full bloom after a couple of sketchy service games and his Australian coach, Tony Roche, looked on with burgeoning pleasure. Roche, who limits the time he spends in Europe, has arrived earlier than usual. \"I asked Tony if he could come now and maybe miss the grass season. Hopefully it's going to pay off in the long run,\" said Federer, who obviously believes his coach's presence may help him win the French Open, the one major to elude him. Federer also clearly believes that Wimbledon, which he has won for the last four years, will take care of itself. He has come a long way from his first professional match, in September 1998, when he beat France's Guillaume Raoux 6-2, 6-2 in Toulouse. . In his semi-final today Federer plays Juan Carlos Ferrero, the champion at Roland Garros four years ago and winner of this title in 2002 and 2003. Ferrero, who knocked out Tim Henman in the first round, defeated Richard Gasquet of France 5-7, 7-5, 6-2, with his withering forehand reigniting memories of his glory days on clay, since eclipsed by the rise of his fellow Spaniard, Rafael Nadal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
