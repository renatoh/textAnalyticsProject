The Department for Transport has confirmed it wishes FirstGroup to run the line for an additional term after the current contract runs out. FirstGroup\u2019s continued tenure is controversial as the transport operator had cut short its contract in 2011 in order to avoid paying more than \u00a3800m in premium payments to the government. However, DfT plans to retender the contract had to be scrapped in the wake of the West Coast mainline fiasco. Instead, FirstGroup was offered an extension until 2015 on more favourable terms as the government kept the franchise system ticking over, with the DfT confirming a further extension until 2019 on Friday. The DfT argues that with a long-term programme of works on the route, including electrification of the track and the introduction of a new fleet of IEP trains, it would prove too disruptive to change operators. The uncontested deal will maintain some foothold in rail for FirstGroup, which has been beaten to a string of contracts, including losing its former First Capital Connect franchise to the new Thameslink franchise, and the shock loss of Scotrail for the Aberdeen-based group to Dutch firm Abellio. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: \u201cAs part of the government\u2019s long-term economic plan I want to see rail travel in the South West transformed. That is why we are delivering a huge programme of electrification and new, modern trains bringing faster, more comfortable and more reliable journeys. \u201cFirst Great Western is best placed to help to deliver these projects over the next four years. \u201cThroughout this period we will continually be looking at new ways to improve the service for passengers including developing proposals for a half hourly service between Plymouth and Penzance which could also serve Exeter.\u201d Unions and Labour have condemned the direct awards for First Great Western. While the terms of the latest extension are to be negotiated, figures obtained by the shadow transport secretary, Mary Creagh, showed that FirstGroup\u2019s payments to the government had plummeted from \u00a3169m a year in 2013 to \u00a317m a year under the first direct award granted under the coalition, which sees FirstGroup run the line until mid-2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
