Even so, their main topic is an important one - the politics of water usage as its planetary distribution changes. They explain dams, irrigation, water recycling and desalination, and consider future impacts of water on crops and populations. The most original ideas are that we should create a \"Conservation and Security Agency\", a sort of community help and disaster-response civilian army composed of the currently jobless, and that the Arab League should reach a peace agreement with Israel in exchange for agricultural know-how and Turkish water."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
