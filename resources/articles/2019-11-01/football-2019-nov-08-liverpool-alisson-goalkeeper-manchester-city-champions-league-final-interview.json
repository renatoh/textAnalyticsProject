That is the popular perception anyway. Alisson offers an alternative theory that explains the punishing standards behind Liverpool\u2019s six-point advantage over Manchester City and his status as the finest goalkeeper in the world today. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel how we felt last season\u201d is his take on the motivation driving J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team into Sunday\u2019s key game with City at Anfield and beyond. Liverpool\u2019s unflappable keeper credits his rise with following the advice that has been constant throughout his career. \u201cEvery goalkeeping coach who has worked with me has told me to always keep calm and cool, as I am, and train hard all the time,\u201d says Alisson, who cites his older brother Muriel, a goalkeeper at Fluminense, as his biggest influence. Cool and calm comes naturally to the guitar-playing 27-year-old but there is an unmistakable perfectionist behind that thoughtful demeanour. Alisson has not tasted defeat for club or country since 1 May \u2013 excluding the penalty shootout loss to City in August\u2019s Community Shield \u2013 but the absence of a clean sheet this season is annoying him greatly. He has enjoyed the most decorated year of his career in 2019 and yet, as with many who reach the summit of their sport, the near-misses gnaw away. In Alisson\u2019s case it is winning the Golden Gloves in his debut Premier League season with 21 clean sheets for a Liverpool team that won a club record 97 points but not the title. That will be a factor on Sunday. \u201cLast season we had a great experience, an almost perfect season,\u201d says Liverpool\u2019s No 1. \u201cWe lost one game and that one game was against City. We know how big this game is for us. We know how big the game is for everyone \u2013 for them and for our fans. In the end it is just three more important points but Manchester City have been the best team in the league for the last few years so we need to give everything to win this game. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel how we felt last season. Being second by just one point \u2013 and we don\u2019t know which game made us lose the title because we had a few draws where we could have done better, and we had the loss away to Man City when we could have won or drawn \u2013 means we know that we need to give everything in every game if we want to become Premier League champions. We want it and we will try to do it.\u201d City\u2019s refusal to yield during last season\u2019s title race was a rare source of regret in an otherwise outstanding year for Alisson. He conquered Europe with Liverpool and then South America with Brazil in the Copa Am\u00e9rica. The two major trophies generated a host of individual awards including Best Fifa Men\u2019s Goalkeeper, Uefa Champions League goalkeeper of the season and Copa Am\u00e9rica Golden Gloves winner. Liverpool\u2019s decision to pay what was briefly a world record sum for a goalkeeper of \u00a365m no longer invites questions. \u201cI do think everything is coming together,\u201d Alisson says between sips of water in the players\u2019 dining area at Anfield. \u201cI have worked hard all my life for those moments and I also made the right choice to come here to play for Liverpool. I felt I would have the possibility to achieve great things here and we had a great season \u2013 everyone did, not just me \u2013 and of course it is nice to get the personal awards but I only have them because I have a great team around me. I achieved it with their help and also with the national team we are doing a great job. We are on the right path and obviously the Copa Am\u00e9rica is an important competition for us but we want more. We are looking for the World Cup.\u201d Success has whetted Alisson\u2019s appetite for every team he represents. Madrid on 1 June provided the pinnacle of his Liverpool career so far, with the keeper reproducing the dominant form that deflated Barcelona in the unforgettable semi-final to thwart Tottenham and ensure his club\u2019s sixth European crown. That was the third of nine consecutive clean sheets and his run of almost 15 hours without conceding was ended only by Paolo Guerrero\u2019s penalty for Peru in the Copa Am\u00e9rica final. The image of Alisson relaxing on the Estadio Metropolitano pitch after the Champions League final, phone in right hand, winner\u2019s medal in his gloved left and ticker-tape all around as he spoke to his wife, Natalia, was among the most memorable from Liverpool\u2019s celebrations. He explains: \u201cMy wife was pregnant and she needed to go to Brazil because I had the Copa Am\u00e9rica coming up afterwards and I always wanted to be there to see the birth of my son. The only way we could make that happen was if she went home to Brazil, and so she missed the final. She couldn\u2019t be there in the stadium and I know how important those moments are for her too. They are important moments for us to be together as a family, my daughter [Helena] also. \u201cMy wife went to every away game with us in the Champions League last season but could not come to the final so I FaceTimed her after the game to bring her inside the stadium and to celebrate with me on the pitch. I wanted her to see and experience everything. It was a special moment. \u201cI said to her: \u2018We are the champions, we got it!\u2019 She worked hard with me for this. I have my teammates working together with me but the most important part of my career is the support I receive from my family \u2013 my wife and my parents. My parents were at the stadium fortunately and it was important for me to speak with my wife and my daughter after we\u2019d won. My daughter misses me when I\u2019m away from home and I told her: \u2018Daddy got it, Daddy got it!\u2019 Everything that happened in the final was really special for me. I lived that final intensely and every moment will be in my mind forever.\u201d Matteo Becker was born the day before Brazil opened their Copa Am\u00e9rica campaign with a win over Bolivia. Alisson\u2019s and Natalia\u2019s plan came to fruition. \u201cI was there for the birth fortunately,\u201d he says. The successful tournament strengthened his position as Brazil\u2019s first choice over Ederson who, despite the growing rivalry between their respective clubs and competition at international level, is a close friend. The City keeper is out of Sunday\u2019s game because of a muscle injury suffered against Atalanta in midweek, according to Pep Guardiola. Alisson had hoped they would face one another. \u201cI speak with him pretty often really because he is a friend. The rivalry between us only starts when we arrive for the game and on the pitch. I see him socially too. Our daughters are the same age and I\u2019ve been to his son\u2019s birthday party. We have a good relationship, our wives have a good relationship and our daughters like to play together. We don\u2019t see each other often \u2013 I would like to see him more often \u2013 but we have our football lives, our jobs to do and our families. It is a busy life.\u201d This has been the most rewarding year of Alisson\u2019s career but also a reminder of how precarious life at the top can be. A calf injury against Norwich on the opening night of the Premier League season sidelined the Liverpool keeper for 10 weeks and cost him the chance of another winner\u2019s medal in the Uefa Super Cup. His deputy, Adri\u00e1n, delivered instead and Alisson believes the painful experience could prove a blessing. \u201cThe first three days it was really difficult to assimilate what had happened,\u201d he says. \u201cStraight after the injury the doctor told me it could be four to six weeks. Then when we did the scan we saw it was a big injury and it became more. In the beginning it was difficult to deal with that but I always have faith in God and I believe things happen for a reason. \u201cI could see the good side of the injury. It meant I could spend more time with my family but also prepare myself better for the whole season because I had four weeks of just treating the calf and then, when I could start to train again and work harder, I had four or five weeks of hard training. It meant I could do a pre-season, something I hadn\u2019t been able to do, and now I am 100% fit in my mind and my body. This will help me for the rest of the season \u2013 and it is a season when we have to give everything.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
