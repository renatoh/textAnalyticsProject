The Indian, who will be 41 during the tournament, will take on the former champion Vlad Kramnik and the current world No1 and likely future champion Magnus Carlsen. They will be the principals in a field which will also include Hikaru Nakamura, ranked No1 in the US, and England's top four Michael Adams, Nigel Short, Luke McShane and David Howell. The fact that Howell, reigning British champion and at age 20 one of the best young talents in Europe, is the lowest ranked player shows that this is indeed an elite contest, which the organisers hope will cement London's bid to stage Anand's next world title defence in 2012. In this game from a current Russian tournament, Kramnik's Berlin Wall defence is defeated by a rather simple plan. White's 13 f4 with b3/c4 aims to render Black's Q-side pawns static while mobilising White's 4-3 majority on the other flank. It worked when Black made an unsound knight sac (22...a6!) which was refuted by 27 Na7+! and 28 e6 with a winning passed pawn for White.
