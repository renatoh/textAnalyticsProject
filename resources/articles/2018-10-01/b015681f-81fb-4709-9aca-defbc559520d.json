Share your thoughts on the upcoming Apec summit", "bodyText": "The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit is due to be held in Papua New Guinea next month, attracting leaders from across the world. The head of the Apec PNG Authority has said more than 15,000 Apec-related visitors are due to visit and are expected to spend 200m kina ($59m) on travel, accommodation and other expenses. The PNG government has touted Apec as a chance for the country to showcase itself as a tourism destination and place for international investment. The government promised that local companies would see the benefits of the summit, receiving contracts to provide transportation, hospitality, catering and other services. However, the lead-up to the summit has been fraught, as the poorest nation in the Apec group has scrambled to prepare buildings, accommodation and infrastructure. The Australian government has committed to help cover some of the costs of the summit, but there are concerns the PNG government is spending millions on Apec while the country struggles with health, education and safety problems, including a resurgence of polio, which has led to the death of a boy, despite the country being declared polio-free in 2000. Tell us your story If you live in Papua New Guinea, we would like to hear from you about the upcoming Apec summit. Have you seen the economic benefits promised by the government?
