The Sale forward left the field after 63 minutes of England's 13-9 victory over Argentina on Saturday. The news is a hammer blow for the England team manager, Martin Johnson, who will be without Courtney Lawes for the next two matches after the lock was suspended on Tuesday for kneeing the Pumas hooker Mario Ledesma. There are also question marks over the fitness of England's captain, the flanker Lewis Moody, who missed the Argentina game with a knee problem. \"It's really sad for Sheri,\" Johnson said. \"He has been unlucky with injuries and we wish him all the best for his recovery. We brought five props so we have options there and we can bring another player out but we will decide what to do about that in due course.\" Paul Doran-Jones of Northampton and Tim Payne of Wasps were the props in England's summer training squad who did not make the cut for the World Cup. There must be a fair chance England will collect more injuries against Georgia on Sunday and Romania on Saturday week. For that reason Johnson will spread the load over the next 10 days. \"You can't say: 'This is the biggest game of your life on Saturday, how are you fixed?'\" he said. \"We can't have players playing in the knockout stages without having played a game earlier in the tournament.\" Moody did train fully on Tuesday, without suffering any obvious ill-effects. The flanker has not played since damaging ligaments against Wales at Twickenham last month. Johnson said: \"Another week is always better when you've been injured for a long time but, at some point, you've got to go and we are hopeful.\" Regarding the form of Jonny Wilkinson, who missed five of eight attempts at goal against Argentina, Johnson believes there may have been an issue with the balls used. Argentina missed six penalty attempts. \"We have some ideas on it,\" Johnson said. \"To me they feel slightly different when they are new compared to when [they] have been used a lot. We haven't got any hard evidence; it is maybe a gut feeling.\" There is rather less concern about the po-faced reaction in certain quarters to Johnson's decision to allow his players to go bungee jumping. \"What they do when they are training is far more dangerous,\" said Johnson. The Lawes hearing has been another unnecessary distraction. An appeal is unlikely. The Northampton lock, the first player to be banned at this World Cup, will be available to face Scotland on 1 October. He pleaded not guilty at his hearing in Auckland but the independent judicial officer, Terry Willis of Australia, decided on a three-week ban, reduced to two because of Lawes' \"excellent disciplinary record and remorse\". Whether you can plead not guilty and still be remorseful is a moot point but Johnson reckons his player was unfortunate. \"He has dived in to make what he thinks is a try-saving tackle and we thought any contact with the knees was incidental. They obviously saw it a little bit differently.\" England will wait until their travelling QC, Richard Smith, has studied the full written judgment before finally deciding whether or not to launch an appeal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
