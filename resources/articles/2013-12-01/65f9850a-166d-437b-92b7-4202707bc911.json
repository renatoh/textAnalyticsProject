But that is just what happened when Pope Francis, in his apostolic exhortation delivered last week, talked about unfettered capitalism as \"a new tyranny\", attacked \u201cthe idoltary of money\u201d, called on rich people to share their wealth, and laid out a vision for a decentralised church. \"Just as the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life\", he said. \"today we also have to say 'thou shalt not' to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills.\u201d Overnight, he became the left\u2019s new pin-up. There was a glimmer of hope in my ex-Catholic soul. Not so much that it changes anything for me now, or even realistically for many Catholics in the near future (it will take more than one man to break down 1,300 years of institutionalisation) but there is something appealing in realising that my faith, even though long lost, was not entirely rotten.That the discomfort that comes with having been part of an institution that condemns women, gay people and divorcees to something other than \u201ctruth and goodness\u201d can somehow be negated. Here was an admission of vulnerability from an institution that prided itself on having answers for the vulnerable, of being the Truth. \u201cI prefer a church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security,\" Francis wrote. But here\u2019s the thing: Pope Francis is as much about saving the church as he is humanity. It is the Catholic mindset that the two are inseparable. This is not simply a man in a position of power taking a stand against the erosion of humanity in the name of capitalism; he has a mission beyond helping the disadvantaged and his message cannot be looked at in isolation of the other things the church still stands for, or even what the church is. While a lot of what Francis said sounded different, new, inspiring, admirable (some would even say Marxist), there are things that remain unchanged. Women priests. Francis called for better collaboration with women and a more \u201cincisive female presence in the church,\u201d but he offered no specifics on how. He was very clear though that ordaining women to the priesthood \u201cis not a question open to discussion.\u201d Abortion. Francis admitted that the church had \u201cdone little to adequately accompany women in very difficult situations.\u201d However, this does not mean accepting abortion as an option for women. \u201cIt is not \u2018progressive\u2019 to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life,\u201d he said. Homosexuality. The New York Times points out that nowhere in the document does Francis explicitly talk about homosexuality but rather mentions \u201cmoral relativism.\u201d He said the church must hold up \u201cobjective moral norms which are valid for everyone.\u201d \u201cThis needs to remain uncompromised even if the church is perceived by supporters of gay rights as promoting prejudice and interfering with individual freedom.\u201d Francis\u2019 message with regard to the denigration of human equality in an increasingly economically focused world is important. On this he is right, bold and revolutionary. But you cannot hold up the notion of better economic equality while imposing a moral hierarchy that creates and perpetuates disadvantage. When it comes to women, this is the churches biggest failing. The way out of poverty is in fact to give women equal standing. Better access to contraception, abortion and education have shown to redress the imbalance, the impact of which in developing nations (and those with the biggest Catholic populations) should not be underestimated. If the Pope really wants to address poverty in the way he says he does, then he needs to understand the role the church has played in creating disadvantage \u2013 directly and indirectly \u2013 for many decades. He has spoken about getting out into the streets and listening. Of being bruised and hurting. Maybe his approach will reveal that in time, but I\u2019m not quite ready to sing its praises."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
