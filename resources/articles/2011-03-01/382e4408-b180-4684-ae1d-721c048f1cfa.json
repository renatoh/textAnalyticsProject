Ponting, 36, has captained the one-day team since 2002 and succeeded Steve Waugh in the Test team two years later. He hopes to continue as a batsman in both forms of the game. Clarke, 29, and Ponting have struggled for runs the past year as Australia's once vaunted team surrendered the Ashes in the winter then bowed out of the World Cup. Ponting denied reports last week that he would quit the captaincy but the Daily Telegraph in Sydney claimed tonight Cricket Australia were about to announce his resignation at a press conference at 1pm ADST (4am BST)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
