But for someone at the centre of a landmark piece of legislation, Shaw is a reluctant politician. Although the Green\u2019s co-leader has been a party member since his teenage years, inspired by the French bombing of Greenpeace\u2019s Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbour in 1985, he responds to a question about whether he is a career MP with, \u201cNo. I can\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t,\u201d and then adds \u201cno\u201d a few more times for emphasis. The former management consultant \u2013 now climate change minister \u2013 sits at the centre of government, but he doesn\u2019t like parliament much, and has to let the \u201cweird stuff\u201d wash over him, he says. Shaw doesn\u2019t have an office. He works, surrounded by staff, in his open-plan ministerial suite, where he has \u201ctaken out a bunch of walls.\u201d It took him four months to convince parliament\u2019s building services that he should be allowed to do it. \u201cI actually had to go to the Speaker and say, look, where is the rule that says the ministers can\u2019t sit with staff?\u201d Shaw says. \u201cAnd he said there actually isn\u2019t a rule. It\u2019s just a tradition. So I said, can I change it?\u201d It improves coordination and \u201cspeeds things up,\u201d he says. If he needs to concentrate, he puts on headphones. When he left the world of management consultancy and became an MP in 2014, politics was a means to an end, he says: \u201cEven some of the largest, most powerful, most moneyed-up companies in the world still operate within system constraints.\u201d \u201cAnd the place where those constraints occur are actually things to do with regulatory and pricing and tax and that kind of stuff. In other words, it\u2019s political.\u201d Now he\u2019s at the centre of New Zealand\u2019s zero-carbon push as a key coalition partner in Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government. It\u2019s no coincidence that Ardern\u2019s opening speech at the United Nations climate summit in September, closely echoed his views. The world faces a \u201cstark\u201d situation she said, urging those listening that with the necessary changes, progress was \u201cwithin our grasp.\u201d \u201cI wrote a lot of it,\u201d Shaw says. \u2018All the more reason to try\u2019 Shaw, 46, is \u2013 unlike Ardern \u2013 an unknown on the world stage, but he is he is the architect behind some of the most ambitious climate policies that anyone in the world is trying to enact. \u201cI think sometimes a domestic audience undervalues or underestimates the impact on global action of action by other countries,\u201d he says, of the oft-cited fact that New Zealand is responsible for just 0.17% of global emissions. \u201cPart of what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re role modelling for other countries. And actually, countries do look at each other and go, where are we relative to the pack?\u201d On whether global heating can be curbed, he says: \u201cI think the chances are slim.\u201d But there\u2019s no reason for not trying, he adds. \u201cIn fact, that\u2019s all the more reason to try.\u201d It is an optimistic view for a man who is reluctant to use the word \u201coptimism.\u201d As well as being New Zealand\u2019s climate tsar, statistics minister and associate finance minister, Shaw, has co-led the Green party since 2015. The party\u2019s eight MPs support Ardern\u2019s governing Labour party, giving her the majority she needs to stay in power, along with New Zealand First. Together their climate agenda is ambitious: the zero carbon act \u2014 passed Thursday and loosely modelled on Britain\u2019s 2008 Climate Change Act \u2013 legally enshrines a framework for New Zealand to keep global heating within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. A plan to tax farmers for their emissions from 2025, or earlier if they are not making progress on reductions, was announced earlier this month. A proposed law that would force businesses to declare climate change risks to their shareholders is also on the cards. But at each turn \u2013 due to the three-party deal the Greens are a part of in government, and Shaw\u2019s efforts to get cross-parliament support for his bills where possible \u2013 there were concessions and compromises made. On the day he announced New Zealand\u2019s farmers would \u2013 in a world first \u2013 begin to pay for carbon emissions from 2025, Shaw sparked a furore inside his own movement. Farmers were broadly supportive of the move, because it gave them a grace period to work on the problem themselves, although some did not want to be taxed on emissions at all. But environmental groups, the Green party\u2019s traditional allies, accused him of caving to agricultural interests. Analysts speculated on whether Shaw had gambled with his party\u2019s fate at next year\u2019s election. \u2018A Punch and Judy show\u2019 Does the climate change portfolio feel like everyone is perpetually slightly unhappy with him? \u201cIt feels like that every day. That\u2019s exactly it,\u201d he says. But with all eyes on New Zealand \u2013 particularly those of other agricultural countries \u2013 the government had to do something. \u201cFor 30 years, we\u2019ve been involved in this Punch and Judy show, and it\u2019s resulted in nothing,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cAnd so one side simply winning over the other, which has been the record of the last three decades, just isn\u2019t going to cut it. We\u2019ve got to get started.\u201d Shaw walks to work when he can; he passed his full driver\u2019s license test this year and still does not like to drive. A violent episode in March, when he was punched in the face on his way to work by a man who had targeted him for his political views, did not deter him from going out alone, a luxury New Zealand\u2019s politicians are rare in being permitted. The assault generated a day of frenzied debate in New Zealand about the safety of its lawmakers. Thirty hours later, the nation\u2019s attention was diverted by the deadly terrorist attack in Christchurch, in which 51 people were killed. Shaw, sporting a black eye, arrived in the city the day after the shootings. He was \u201cemotionally pretty thrown\u201d by the attacks, he said, but New Zealand\u2019s response had been \u201cbrilliant, not perfect.\u201d \u201cThose kinds of things can tip you into a very dark place, and we didn\u2019t go there,\u201d he says. The political, for now, leaves no time for much else. He draws a blank when asked to name books or music he enjoys; weekends will, if he\u2019s lucky, involve a walk with his wife, Annabel and a craft beer \u2013 \u201cone of my greatest pleasures of modern Wellington\u201d \u2013 when the work he brings home allows it. The table-top role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, always a big part of his life, is on the back-burner. He only keeps up with new episodes of Star Trek: Discovery because he is not allowed to read ministerial papers on aeroplanes. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing particularly about sci fi where you\u2019re imagining possible futures,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so interestingly, there\u2019s a coherence there between what we do here and that.\u201d But he says his move to politics and all has come with it will be worthwhile if \u201cthat was the moment when we got on top of our emissions and started to bring them down.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
