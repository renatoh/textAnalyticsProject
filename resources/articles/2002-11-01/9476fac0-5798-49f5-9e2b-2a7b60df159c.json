What I believe in, is bringing the two together - preferably under one roof. Experience around the country has highlighted that failures in communication between agencies place children at risk; in the worst case, of losing their lives. An avoidable child death is what we all fear, and the tragic case of Victoria Climbie is but one of a number in recent decades that have caused everyone to ask why, despite a wealth of legislation and guidlines, such events still occur. Even when police child protection officers and social workers have a positive working relationship - as we generally have in Coventry - it's often because dedicated staff form personal bonds of trust or go the extra mile to cover for inadequacies in a system that compartmentalises us and inhibits a common understanding. The child protection cases where police most commonly get involved in a joint investigation with social services are those involving direct allegations of sexual abuse, and all cases of serious assault and persistent abuse. In Coventry, there are some 60,000 children. Around 8,000 of them are children \"in need\". There are approximately 350 on the Child Protection Register, and around 500 children who are \"looked after\" - that is, either in council care or with foster parents, having been removed from their biological parents. More than 2,000 have a disability, of whom over 700 have some sort of mental health problem. The city's social services department has been under government special measures for the past few years, having been classified as one of the worst social services departments and found to be persistently failing vulnerable children. For my part, I am responsible for policing crime in the north-east of Coventry, but have a city-wide police responsibility in child protection through running our force's unit dedicated to that. The Coventry Child Protection Unit has: a detective sergeant supervisor; six permanent staff (two experienced detectives, one part-time administrator, and the rest specially trained child abuse investigators; two attached officers at any one time, for a period of six months. The remit of our unit is to focus on offences against children where the accused is a family member (Intra Familia). Examples would be all immediate family including grandparents, cousins or a carer of a child such as a childminder or babysitter; or where the abuser is a professional, such as a teacher, sports coach, residential home worker, or religious representative. Local guidelines set by the area child protection committee determine that while the social services department and the police will consider the individual circumstances of each case, the police take an active role, as mentioned earlier, in the cases of serious assault, persistent abuse, or alleged sexual abuse. Any investigative interviews of children are recorded on video and conducted by trained staff - generally one or more police officers and social workers together. But while joint training has long been a feature of joint working in this area, we've found social workers reticent about being identified with the investigative process. They'll be present at an interview as spectators, but take no part in putting questions to a child victim. If this stems from lack of confidence due to inexperience at such interviews, then I'd like to ask: is there a need for some social workers to specialise in this area? One of my officers offers this observation: \"I've actively sought to make the investigative process one that they understand is child centred with the outcome having the best interests of the child at heart. For example, the necessity of a court appearance in prosecuting a case is very carefully considered, and if detrimental to the child does not take place.\" I believe we could eradicate the first barrier to communication - the inability to have face to face discussion of cases day by day - if social workers and the police Child Protection Unit could be brought together in the same office. We do talk (there are telephone discussions as a precursor to strategy meetings and case conferences), but far less than we would working alongside eachother under the same roof; each organisation has its own databases, too, which without a true and meaningful exchange of data may potentially expose children to greater risk. These physical barriers undermine our best intentioned efforts to safeguard children. Detective Constable Andy McCord, one of my most experienced officers, says he believes that \"the only way forward is for joint teams (police and social workers) to be in the same department working on the same cases. This will benefit the child, as this team will be with them from the beginning to the end of a case. Police and social services will also become more aware of each others' practices and understand the value of eachothers' teams. There is still some suspicion of both parties' views and we still even today have different agendas and are sometimes poles apart in our views. This will continue until we all have open minds and are willing to quickly adapt to the cultures of different agencies.\" Ultimately the public might come to see the police and social services as a joint agency concerned with the protection of children. The location of such a cross-discipline Child Protection Unit does not need to be on police premises, if that were a sticking point. There is an argument that non-police premises, certainly for video interview suites, are far more desirable for a child focussed investigation. Here in Coventry, our two agencies have come to some early agreement in principle about having a co-located joint unit, of which there are some examples elsewhere in the country. But as yet there is no clear model showing how joint units would translate the Department of Health's landmark 1999 document \"Working Together to Safeguard Children\" - which sets out how all agencies and professionals should collaborate to promote children's welfare and protect them - from rhetoric into reality. I feel we all need a clear national lead that gives priority to child protection and the need for closer police-social services working relationships. - DCI Bob Bird has been an officer with West Midlands Police for 25 years.

He performed a number of roles before promotion to chief inspector in 1997.
