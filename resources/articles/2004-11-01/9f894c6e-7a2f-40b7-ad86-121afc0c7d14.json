While they can give the Square Mile valuable insight into how a business behaves on the ground, they also allow a bunch of City types free rein to poke their noses into a company's business. Mining group Antofagasta fell foul of the second type of visit as a field trip to its copper operations in Chile generated talk that the company is being primed for a bid from US rival Phelps Dodge Corporation, the world's second largest producer of copper. Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge, quoted on the New York stock exchange, last month reported net income of $293m for the third quarter. It already has an interest in a Chilean mining operation but is understood to be looking to increase its exposure to the area in anticipation of growing demand - especially from China. Antofagasta is in something of a weak position. Although its production sites are performing well, senior manage ment is in a transitional phase. Earlier this month the company announced that Andronico Luksic is stepping down as chairman. His son Jean-Paul Luksic has taken over the top spot. But analysts who flew out to Chile said yesterday that many of the senior managers they expected to see on their trip to Antofagasta's major Los Pelambres mine were absent. The rumour around the company was that they were in the US dealing with the Phelps Dodge board. A spokesman for the company, however, played down market talk of an imminent bid saying the company's new president was on hand to talk with analysts during the trip while Jean-Paul Luksic was in Argentina with his father. As for the trip itself, broker Numis reiterated its \"buy\" stance, saying it was considering raising its forecasts as a result of strong production growth at the group's El Tesoro and Los Pelambres mines. The broker said Los Pelambres could raise production towards 140-150,000 tonnes of copper a day. The stock closed up 3p at 1100p. The mining group was just one of the bright spots in a FTSE 100 index that closed up 9.2 points at 4803.1 - its highest position since June 2002 - marking its fifth consecutive day's positive trading. Volume, however, was a rather subdued 2.2 million shares. Mobile phone company mmO2 put on the day's biggest rise, up 1.5p at 107p, as analysts looked forward to tomorrow's figures from the former unit of BT which are expected to in clude details of its first ever dividend. Persistent bid talk also surrounds the company, although insiders yesterday tried to play down rumours that managers have met representatives of Spain's Telefonica to discuss a potential tie-up. Fellow mobile operator Vodafone was also strong, up 1p at 142.75, ahead of today's results which are expected to show significant free cashflow, although on a pre-tax level the company will be far into the red due to accounting charges linked with the Mannesmann acquisition. Heading in the opposite direction, Dixons dropped 2p to 166.5p as CSFB moved its stance on the retailer to neutral from outperform and cut its price target by 15p to 160p. ITV moved down 0.75p to 112.5p as talk that it may expand into radio offset persistent talk of an imminent buyout. Away from the main index the FTSE 250 closed up 10.2p at 6592.5 points. Scottish telecoms company Thus was the biggest second line gainer, up 1.25p at 15.5p, following its interim results which contained no nasty surprises after its profit warning back in September. Some in the City believe the company is ripe for a takeover although chief executive Bill Allan said he has received no approaches. Novar added 7.5p to 163p as talk of a bidding war for the industrials group intensified, while Chrysalis dropped 11.25p to 164p after the media group warned that radio advertising has been weak in the first quarter of its financial year. Ashtead Group added 3p to 77p on talk that trading at the support services firm has been strong while Kleeneze gained some speculative support, up 8.5p at 133.5p, and translation software group SDL International added 2p to 120p after signing a deal in China. Down on Aim, hedge fund group RAB Capital was 2.75p higher at 43.75p on talk of an imminent restructuring of the business while Debt Free Direct Group added 3p to 111p on hopes that a forthcoming government survey on consumer lending will favour consumer debt refinancing businesses. Matrix Communications added 8p to 170.5p after the communications technology group bought rival Network Partners for \u00a312m in cash and shares. The deal is expected to be profit-enhancing from day one. Network Partners provides value added telecommunications services. Elsewhere, mobile phone content business Monstermob added 15p to 163.5p after announcing it is confident it will beat market forecasts of annual pretax profits of \u00a32.3m, after profits for the July to October period rose to more than \u00a31.2m with trading in the second half \"significantly improved\". Finally, recent float Clearstream Technology added 2.5p to 85.5p on talk that the latest device from the biotechnology company, whose cardiac stents were used to treat David Bowie, has received good results in recent trials. Will the fat lady sing? Traders were left unsatisfied by ebookers yesterday as the hoped- for bid for the online travel agency failed to materialise. The company is still in talks with several potential bidders - at least one of whom is believed to be a financial buyer - who have been using the data room set up by adviser CSFB. Finance director Michael Healy said yesterday that he hoped a sale could be sewn up by the end of the year but could not promise investors a deal would definitely be done. \"A former colleague of mine always used to say it's not over until the fat lady sings. But the whole process has... brought a degree of introspection about where the company is going,\" he said. The company yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.9m compared with \u00a33.2m a year ago as sales increased to \u00a3159m from \u00a3145m. The shares closed down 6.5p at 285.5p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
