City have missed out on Claudio Ranieri after he grew tired of waiting and had his head turned by Juventus but they have been encouraged by the latest round of discussions and hope the convoluted process is now in its final stages. City hope to be in a position where they can almost immediately bring in a new manager to fill the gap left by Stuart Pearce's sacking. Although disappointed to have missed out on the former Parma head coach, Thaksin's representatives have been surprised by the interest in the position. Intermediaries acting on behalf of the Sevilla coach Juande Ramos are among those who have been in contact to say he is available, even though his club insisted yesterday he would not leave. \"He is in discussions with the club in order to get another contract,\" a Sevilla spokesman said The information that has reached Thaksin's advisers is different but it has been emphasised the approach came from Spain rather than the other way around. City's board believe Thaksin is also looking at Louis van Gaal, in charge of the Dutch club AZ, and Co Adriaanse, who is leaving the Ukraine club FC Metalurg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
