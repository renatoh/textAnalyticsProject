Mauricio Pochettino has spoken of the need for a \u201cpainful rebuild\u201d at the end of the season, which has fuelled the sense the club is approaching a crossroads. Rose has been among a host of players linked with a summer exit. \u201cI keep seeing my name that I\u2019m being sold, so if that\u2019s the case and it\u2019s going to be my last game for Tottenham against Liverpool, I\u2019m hoping to go out with a bang and lift a trophy,\u201d the left-back said. \u201cIt\u2019s a Champions League final so individual situations have to take a back seat and you have to put the club first. We are going to do that. We do realise we have a chance to make history.\u201d Pochettino has added to the uncertainty by putting his future back on the agenda with a series of recent comments. The manager told El Pa\u00eds on the eve of Wednesday\u2019s semi-final second-leg victory at Ajax that he turned down the chance to succeed Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid last summer because he had just signed a new five-year contract at Spurs. He made it clear it was a difficult decision. Pochettino then said at his pre-Ajax press conference he might walk away from Spurs if his team won the Champions League \u2013 and added he was not joking. At the time it was difficult to read him although, after the game, he made it rather clearer he had been joking. \u201cYes I am going to leave \u2013 maybe if I lose too,\u201d he said, with heavy sarcasm. Pochettino has challenged the chairman, Daniel Levy, on more than one occasion to match the club\u2019s ambitions to the scale of its magnificent new stadium \u2013 to close a five-year chapter and operate in a different way, \u201clike a big club\u201d. He has hinted he wants to see heavier spending and more decisive action in the transfer market. The key to greater latitude will be player sales because, with repayments to meet on the \u00a31bn stadium project, Pochettino will not be granted huge funds in net terms. Christian Eriksen\u2019s situation is pivotal. The midfielder has stalled on signing a contract to replace the one that expires in June next year and, if he cannot be persuaded to recommit in the summer, Levy will look to cash in. He has let it be known the Dane would cost \u00a3130m, which sounds fanciful but this is Levy and, moreover, it offers an indication of how the battle lines are being drawn. Real Madrid are prominent among Eriksen\u2019s suitors. Were he to go for big money, Spurs would bid for higher-level, more expensive players. Toby Alderweireld has an attractive-looking \u00a325m buyout clause in his contract this summer while Kieran Trippier is of interest to Napoli. The futures of Fernando Llorente, Victor Wanyama, Michel Vorm, Vincent Janssen and Georges-K\u00e9vin Nkoudou are uncertain. Harry Kane, who damaged ankle ligaments against Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-final first leg on 9 April, remains optimistic he will be fit for the final. Kane sprinted across the pitch to join the celebrations after the Ajax game and he will return to training on grass next week. If everything goes to plan, he could be working with the ball by next weekend. Kane roused his teammates with a heartfelt half-time speech, as they trailed 2-0 on the night and 3-0 on aggregate, asking them whether this was how they wanted to be remembered. Lucas Moura\u2019s second-half hat-trick turned the tie around and secured the club\u2019s progress on the away goals rule. Trippier said: \u201cHarry is exceptional for club and country and we\u2019re all hoping he can be back because of his presence \u2013 even at half-time [in Amsterdam], he\u2019s coming in going mental at us because we can do better which we all knew. This is what we need, the leadership that he has.\u201d Rose added: \u201cIt\u2019s 50-50 in the final, a one-off game. Liverpool are a great team and they might be Premier League champions. The gaffer mentioned beforehand how they played against Barcelona [in the semi-final second leg] \u2013 he said the attitude we needed is what Liverpool showed. We watched it in the hotel and he\u2019s made us a promise, which I won\u2019t say until after the final, but he wants us to go and win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
