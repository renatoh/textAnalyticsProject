The Liberal Democrats and penal reform campaigners said the revised estimates underlined how Operation Safeguard, the programme to relieve the pressure on the Prison Service, demonstrated that the taxpayer was being forced to pick up the tab for the government's failure to reform sentencing properly. The figure is higher than the government's original estimate of \u00a3385 a night and far higher than the \u00a377-a-night average cost of keeping a male prisoner in a category B jail. Jenny Willott, the Lib Dems' justice spokeswoman, said: \"The government's gross incompetence in managing our prison system is leaving the taxpayer picking up a huge bill. Ministers have massively underestimated the knock-on costs of prison overcrowding. For \u00a3460 per night, a family could buy a week-long stay in a holiday villa in the Canaries.\" She added: \"The government has put us in this hopeless position by failing to plan for the future while putting record numbers behind bars in an effort to appear tough on crime.\" A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said: \"The overall costs of Operation Safeguard have not risen. The original estimate was based on previous use of police cells in 2002, whereas the current estimate is from a more realistic assessment based on actual recent costs.\" Last year 60,953 prisoners were housed in police cells, costing \u00a328m. Despite a scheme introduced by the justice secretary, Jack Straw, which saw the early release of more than 10,000 prisoners, 65 inmates in England and Wales were still being held in police stations on Friday, among the total prison population of 80,778 - just 967 fewer than capacity in England and Wales. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \"These figures reveal the shocking amount of public money being thrown away on the inappropriate use of police cells to bail out overcrowded jails. The price of this panic buying has been a waste of police time, a continuing rise in prison numbers and high reconviction rates. \"If the government focused on investing in drug and alcohol treatment for addicts, court diversion schemes for the mentally ill and effective community sentences, we would see both prison numbers and crime falling.\" Earlier this month, figures showed a 37% rise in prison suicides in 2007, to 92 compared with 67 in 2006. Another plank of government security policy came under fire yesterday when a leaked Home Office document said young drivers could be forced to accept identity cards. Gordon Brown has always insisted they would remain voluntary for British citizens, at least until parliament decided otherwise. Foreigners will be required to have an ID card from later this year. The Home Office memo, leaked to the Sunday People and headed Options for Analysis, says: \"Various forms of coercion, such as designation of the application process for identity documents issued by UK ministers (eg passports), are an option to stimulate applications in a manageable way. There are advantages to designation of documents associated with particular target groups, eg young people applying for their first driving licence.\" It said that \"universal compulsion should not be used unless absolutely necessary\". David Davis, the shadow home secretary, accused the government of \"a desperate attempt to bolster a failed policy\". Shami Chakrabarti, director of the human rights group Liberty, said: \"So much for a voluntary scheme ... compulsion is the ultimate ambition of this scheme and it can be achieved by stealth without the need for further parliamentary debate.\" A Home Office spokesman said: \"We do not comment on leaked documents ... our first priority is to consider where ID cards can be of greatest benefit to the UK and to the individual.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
