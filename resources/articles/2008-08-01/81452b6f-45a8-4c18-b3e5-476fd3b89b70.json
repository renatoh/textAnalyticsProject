The department is already facing an increase in the number of disputes, accusations that it is unfairly driving people into bankruptcy and concerns that it is mishandling tax credit cases. It has led one leading body to call for reintroduction of a taxpayers' charter - the safeguard introduced by the Major government in the 1990s but dropped by Labour after the 1997 election. The Chartered Institute of Taxation believes HMRC needs to redraw its relationship with taxpayers based on a mix of statutory rights and a charter. It said rights of appeal, time limits on investigations and protection against disclosure of confidential information or legal advice should be given proper statutory form. \"There are some more general, broader rights for which a charter is the more suitable instrument,\" it said. \"For example, you have the right to be believed in anything you tell the revenue authorities, unless there is evidence that what you are saying is not true; the revenue authorities should collect the right amount of tax, not necessarily the maximum amount of tax which could be levied; you have the right to be represented at a meeting with the revenue authorities by a person of your choice.\" A recent study by City law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain found a 37% jump in the number of applications made to the tax tribunals over the space of a year, from 3,146 in 2006 to 4,311 in 2007. It said the figures confirm that taxpayers are increasingly prepared to challenge HMRC's \"aggressive tax collection tactics and harsh penalties\". One such case involves Neil Martin, a builder from Preston who saw his business go to the verge of bankruptcy in 2001 after HMRC failed to process his application for a tax exemption certificates for months. Without the certificates he lost hundreds of thousands of pounds. He complained and after a long appeal received an apology and \u00a355,000. He was forced to go to court and in a landmark decision last year, a tax tribunal ruled that HMRC owed him a duty of care after it was found to have made \"persistent errors\" in calculating his tax. However, the tribunal ruled against the builder, who said he lost \u00a3500,000 and faced a \u00a3250,000 tax bill as a result of the debacle. Martin is now pursuing the case in the House of Lords. His barrister, James Kessler QC, is challenging HMRC over whether it has the right to submit secret evidence to tax tribunals. In Martin's case, HMRC obtained legal advice from a government department that influenced the outcome of an appeal. A tribunal allowed HMRC to submit evidence in support of its arguments in a closed session, meaning Martin was unable to challenge what was submitted. Last year the Information Commissioner backed HMRC, though it criticised the tax authority after it refused to disclose reasons for keeping the advice secret. Kessler believes the tribunal's decision sets a dangerous precedent. While more taxpayers are prepared to challenge HMRC, the time limit on rebates of overpaid tax which are gained from successful appeals is to be reduced from five to four years. Accountants UHY Hacker Young said 44% of claims are for tax refunds that go back six years and the average claim was for \u00a31,963. It said the system would be unfair because HMRC will often still be able to recover underpaid tax \"for longer than the four-year limit\". Some tax advisers accept that HMRC is not an aggressive arm of government waging war on taxpayers, not least because it does not have the firepower for that. Internal reviews have shown that HMRC's IT systems are in disarray and staff morale is at an all-time low. The addition of tax credits to its list of responsibilities has also complicated its relationship with taxpayers. Many tax credit recipients are vulnerable and on low wages. Officials have found treating them as if they are affluent tax dodgers has proved counter-productive. Case study Patrick Cullinane, has campaigned to overturn his bankruptcy since 1992 without success. The former Pinewood stage hand was accused by HMRC of making six-figure profits from letting his semi in London and moonlighting from his film industry job. A claim by the Revenue for \u00a368,000 in unpaid tax eventually led to his bankruptcy and eviction from his home. A succession of leaked documents and emails from HMRC reveal there was no evidence for either allegation. His home was largely uninhabitable during the period of the claim. His \"moonlighting\" involved returning to Ireland between film jobs to see his family. The case rested on accusations by an \"unnamed informer\". In correspondence, investigators discussed how the case could be thrown out if the lack of evidence was questioned by an appeals tribunal. Evidence put to the high court shows that Cullinane, far from owing tax, was due a rebate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
