He plays grumpy veteran newsman Mike Pomeroy, forced to co-anchor an appallingly fluffy breakfast show with Diane Keaton's equally jaded star Colleen Peck. This wacky pairing has been contrived by perky new producer Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams). The script is by Aline Brosh McKenna, who wrote The Devil Wears Prada and there are obvious similarities \u2013 new kid intimidated by oldster \u2013 but nothing about the chemistry works here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
