Pesto, which is traditionally made from basil, pine nuts, parmesan, olive oil \u2013 and sometimes lemon juice and garlic \u2013 has become a staple food in the UK. However, a Which? investigation into pesto sold by Asda, Co-op, M&amp;S, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Waitrose found that supermarket own-labels used cashew nuts instead of pine nuts, sunflower oil instead of olive oil and cheaper grana padano cheese instead of parmesan to cut costs. The analysis found the most authentic and traditional pestos on sale were the Asda Extra Special Genovese Basil Pesto, costing \u00a31.39, and the Waitrose 1 Pesto alla Genovese, priced at \u00a32.70. All standard supermarket pestos, with the exception of Waitrose, used thickeners such as potato flakes, bamboo fibres and nut flour; Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Co-op recipes also contained sugar, while Tesco lists water as an ingredient of its standard pesto. Premium pesto recipes, advertised as \u201cpesto alla Genovese\u201d, must contain the traditional quartet of basil, olive oil, pine nuts and parmesan, but some supermarkets added extra ingredients: sugar, vegetable fibres and bamboo were all added to Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco Pesto alla Genovese recipes. Nikki Stopford, director of research at Which?, said: \u201cPesto has become a staple food in the UK but our research shows that many shoppers may be getting more than they bargain for when it comes to the pesto they are buying \u2013 and not necessarily in a good way. \u201cOur advice is not to assume that all pesto contains the same traditional ingredients. Check the ingredients list if authenticity is important to you, or if you are trying to avoid certain contents, such as added sugar.\u201d Recipe: Rachel Roddy\u2019s basic pesto 50g basil 30g pine nuts or almonds 100ml olive oil 1\u20132 garlic cloves 50g parmesan or pecorino, grated Pulse the basil, pine nuts, olive oil, and garlic together in a blender until you have a paste, then stir in the cheese."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
