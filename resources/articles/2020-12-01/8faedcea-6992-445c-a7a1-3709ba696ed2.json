With Patrick Bamford\u2019s movement unhinging an increasingly disorientated Newcastle, it facilitated a stylish escape, ending a run of four points from their previous six games. Rodrigo and Jack Harrison excelled but, along the way, Steve Bruce received another reminder of his team\u2019s limitations. \u201cIt was a deserved victory, we attacked a lot,\u201d said Bielsa, with a certain understatement. \u201cWe managed the ball very patiently; that\u2019s the thing that most impressed me\u201d At times the home side monopolised with almost 75% of possession, mustering 25 shots on targets but, initially, they struggled to translate the dominance into goals. As Bruce is fond of pointing out, teams do not necessarily have to see too much of the ball to be effective and, by way of proving his point, Newcastle were ahead in the 26th minute thanks to Jeff Hendrick\u2019s first-time volley. Jamal Lewis fed Ryan Fraser whose whipped-in cross was flicked on by Callum Wilson, leaving Hendrick to apply the finishing touch. Bruce\u2019s four summer signings had combined to create what would prove a fragile, highly deceptive, lead. If Newcastle can be effective they also remain flawed and no one was entirely surprised when Bamford equalised on the rebound, nodding in from close range after Rodrigo\u2019s header in the wake of Raphinha\u2019s cross had rebounded off the bar. It was Bamford\u2019s ninth goal in 13 games this season, not bad for a player widely predicted to struggle at this level. Karl Darlow was once coveted by Bielsa and he reminded the Argentinian of his quality by performing wonders to repel Raphinha\u2019s half-volley and redirect Liam Cooper\u2019s header. Federico Fern\u00e1ndez made a vital block to deny Rodrigo and even though Newcastle thought they might have had a penalty when Cooper clattered Wilson, Leeds retained an aggressive intensity. They were in front when Rodrigo and Harrison combined in a lovely move concluded with the former\u2019s scoring header. Not for nothing, though, does Bruce praise Newcastle\u2019s resilience and back they came, Ciaran Clark meeting Fraser\u2019s cross to head beyond Ilan Meslier. Even so, an audacious backheel by Bamford might have prefaced another visiting concession before Leeds\u2019s third goal, with 12 minutes remaining, was headed past Darlow by the unmarked Stuart Dallas following Mateusz Klich\u2019s cross. Ezgjan Alioski struck from just inside the area after being superbly set up by substitute Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez at the end of a clever counterattacking move before Harrison, after gathering the ball 10 yards inside his own half, completed the scoring with a fabulous 25-yard shot into the top-left corner. \u201cWe\u2019ve been punished for giving away bad goals,\u201d said Bruce, who must have struggled to comprehend how Leeds had failed to win their previous five games here. \u201cWe should have had a penalty, but some of our defending was what you see on a park on a Sunday. We gave the ball away far too cheaply, far too many times. \u201cIn areas where we could have hurt Leeds, we missed the pass far too often. It\u2019s difficult to swallow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
