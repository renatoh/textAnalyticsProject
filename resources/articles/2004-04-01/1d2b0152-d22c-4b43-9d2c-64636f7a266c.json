I had \u00a350 with which to buy tickets for five shows in London's biggest theatres and opera houses. Even if I did manage to find seats available in a busy bank holiday period, I was sure I would be spending all my time peering around columns with my knees in my nostrils. \"Legroom! Fantastic!\" That was the first thing the tall man in K12 said to his girlfriend as they sat down to my left in the balcony of the Coliseum. Glancing at the serried squadrons in front of us, each one vacuum-packed into their seat, I realised how right he was. A quick tip for tall, cheap opera-lovers: if you're buying balcony seats at English National Opera, buy them in row K, at the very back - for some reason they are much roomier than the rest. Suddenly the lights dimmed and everyone started clapping. Must be an opera thing, I supposed - a kind of warm-up. Then I realised that we were applauding the conductor, who had walked on somewhere out of sight below us. The clapping went on for a while, so I guessed that the orchestra were bowing, too. They could have been juggling cellos for all I'd have known about it. But once the show got under way, I began to feel pretty pleased with my \u00a35 ticket, available by phone on the day of the performance. I could hear perfectly and see the whole stage, except the front right corner - surely one of the bargains of the West End. Thursday, 7.30pm Festen, Almeida Seat C30, \u00a36 return ticket A trying day. My first choice had been The Barber of Seville at Raymond Gubbay's new Savoy Opera - but the few \u00a310 seats they provide had long since sold out, and they expected no returns. At the half-price kiosk in Leicester Square, I found what were described as \"good seats\" for \u00a319.50 each - beyond my budget. So, off to Islington's Almeida for Jonny Lee Miller in Festen, a rare event where the audience's haircuts were more expensive than their seats. I had been told that the run was sold out but that some of the restricted-view seats in the balcony might be returned. To take advantage, I had to get on the list at 6.30pm, for which queuing began, well, whenever people started queuing. As curtain-up approached, the looks I got from the box-office staff became increasingly despondent. But then, with no warning, a ticket was thrust into my hand and I was in. The Almeida is a small theatre, so one is always close to the action. But from my position, half of the drama was played out on shoulders and backs of heads. I was staring straight into the lights in the wings, too, and the right third of the stage (in which, worse luck, the maid undresses) was completely hidden. It was an excellent show, however, making \u00a36 feel like a good deal. And C30 did have its compensations. Few other seats would have shown, for example, that when Miller's character experiences high emotion, his scalp reddens authentically - a nice touch. Friday, 8pm Endgame, Albery Seat C9, \u00a317.50 phone booking Having saved so much money elsewhere, I thought I'd treat myself to Beckett's plotless masterpiece about the painful futility of life. According to the Albery employee I spoke to on the phone, \u00a317.50 (plus a disgraceful \u00a32.50 booking fee) was as cheap as it got, unless the performance were to sell out, in which case they'd offer a few \u00a310 standing tickets at the last minute. And would it sell out? \"No.\" On arrival, I discovered that there were also some \u00a315 restricted view seats available on the day, but I was glad I didn't have one. The Albery balcony is very high and very steep, and at the sides the seats look more like window ledges. Emerging into the auditorium is vertiginous, but once you are sitting down the whole of the stage is clearly visible. The seats are big and comfy, too. Endgame is not an easy play, and if you're going to grasp it at all it's important to see and hear the actors clearly. The couple behind me didn't manage it, and left halfway through. I sympathised. In such distant seats, face-acting is a luxury one does without, but at times it would have come in useful to help make sense of the muffled dialogue - a problem as much down to the play's Irish sibilants, perhaps, as my distance from the actors. Ordinarily, I would pay extra to avoid Lee Evans's hilarious gurning, but tonight he was good and I sense I missed out. Saturday, 7.30pm Cyrano de Bergerac, National Theatre Seat G20, \u00a310 Travelex ticket There is surely not a production in London more different from Endgame than this one. Once again, facial details were indistinguishable, except of course for that nose, which I could just make out, swinging gamely in the distance like the keel on a capsized fishing boat. I was right at the back of the great Olivier amphitheatre, in a seat that would, according to the woman I bought my ticket from, have cost \u00a310 even outside the Travelex season. There were much better places available for the same price on other nights, she pointed out, but I had my mission and I brushed her aside. In fact, my comfortable seat offered the most complete view of the weekend. Parts of the action were hidden at times by the huge scaffolding set, but then I imagine most people shared the same problem. In any case, this Cyrano is strong on spectacle, hearty laughter and tossing of victuals - the sort of thing for which one needs no close-up. Monday, 2pm Romeo and Juliet, Royal Ballet Seat AA16, \u00a36 phone booking From Upper Slips Left, the Royal Opera House is a sight to behold. And as I squeezed through to my place, down the length of a red velvet bench, I thought I sensed a spirit of cheap-seat camaraderie as we looked down at all the overpaid mugs in the stalls. But as soon as the curtain went up, I took it all back. Let me make this quite clear: AA16 is the worst seat I have ever sat in. The left-hand quarter of the stage was missing, as was a good slice of the top - obscured by a vast royal crest hanging from the proscenium. Not that this mattered much, since the only way of seeing past the person on my left was to lean over the balustrade, which pressed painfully on my knees. If I sat back comfortably I could see nothing at all. Besides its conventional failings, AA16 offered another unexpected distraction. The placement of the row behind was such that all of BB's feet were at roughly at AA's nose level, with no partition between the two. Ballet fans will find this a cheap way to sample the real thing, but they should prepare to be more frustrated than entertained. Nor should they forget the hidden osteopath's costs. So: mission accomplished, \u00a344.50 spent - and enough left over for a couple of drinks in the intervals. At these prices, surely it shouldn't be too hard to persuade new audiences into theatres. I think back to the preceding weekend, when I paid \u00a334 for a restricted-view seat at Spurs v Chelsea - only to see my team lose. It's poor value, yet 36,000 people will spend this and more every fortnight. Perhaps it's not the price of culture, after all, but culture itself that tends to put people off. \u00b7 Coliseum: 020-7632 8300. Almeida: 020-7359 4404. Albery: 0870 060 6621.
