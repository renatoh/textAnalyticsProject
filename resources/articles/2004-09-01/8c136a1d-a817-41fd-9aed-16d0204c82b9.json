David Pennington, 46, from Burnley in Lancashire and Martin Oates, 38, from Sheffield, were struck as they got off an engineering train at about 4.30am in Cannock, Staffordshire. Transport police were interviewed staff at the scene of the accident yesterday. The two men were working on track renewal for the line from Stafford to Birmingham for the rail engineering company VGC. Four other workers were taken to hospital in Stafford suffering from shock after the incident, which closed the line all day yesterday. Sean Fitzpatrick, the company's managing director, said: \"Everyone at the company is totally shocked as to what happened and we are trying to come to terms with the loss of the men. \"Both David and Martin had worked on the railways for a very long time and were experienced to the dangers they could face ... we will try and help the police and health and safety officers with their inquiries.\" The men were thought to have been hit by a vehicle on the track alongside the one their train was using. Colin Edwards, the chief inspector of the British Transport police, said that the track at Crab Lane in Cannock was straight and was said to have been well lit. Both lines were \"in possession\" of the repair teams at the time, a standard safety procedure designed to rule out the unexpected arrival of trains. The repair work involved VGC, the freight operators EWS and the rail engineers Carillion. Rail unions asked whether the workers were wearing protective ear plugs, which were criticised after the death of four rail workers at Tebay, Cumbria, last February. The four were working on the west coast mainline when they were hit by a runaway flatbed truck that they had apparently failed to hear coming. Bob Crow, the general secretary of the RMT union, said yesterday: \"After the tragedy at Tebay we called for an inquiry into safety in the fragmented privatised railway regime, but the chaos has continued. We now renew that call and once more we demand that all track renewals be brought back in house in one single, sensible structure.\" A spokesman for the Staffordshire ambulance service said a specialist team with cutting equipment had been sent to the scene along with three ambulances. He said: \"Two of the workers were pronounced dead almost immediately. The other four hadn't suffered any physical injuries but had been traumatised by the experience. It was an horrific scene and they had been very obviously affected by what they had witnessed.\" A report from the Health and Safety Executive earlier this month recorded nine deaths of railway staff in the year to April, three more than in 2002-3."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
