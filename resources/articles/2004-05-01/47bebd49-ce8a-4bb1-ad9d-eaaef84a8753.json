Among the options is playing the Six Nations Championship in the early summer. The weakness of the current system is shown up by the tours the four home unions are making to the southern hemisphere this summer after not staging their traditional friendly internationals last November because of the World Cup. \"We are being hit twice,\" said Francis Baron, the chief exec utive of the Rugby Football Union. \"We lost money by not having incoming tours last autumn and we are having to pay to go away this summer. There is nothing we can do about it because the fixtures are in the tour schedule but we do not want a repeat of this after the next World Cup. Players in the southern hemisphere had a two-month rest after the World Cup while ours will go a year without a break.\" Baron said the IRB had accepted a suggestion from the RFU to hire consultants to come up with a blueprint for a global season by November. \"They will be heavyweights and they will be objective,\" he said. The RFU has reached an agreement with the Professional Rugby Players' Association over the issue of image rights. The players will consider the union's proposals over the weekend. Newcastle, meanwhile, have signed the ACT Brumbies Fijian-born Radike Samo who can play at lock, flanker or wing. Jacques Cronje, younger brother of Geo who was at the centre of the race row that overshadowed South Africa's build-up to the World Cup last year, is one of two uncapped players in the latest Springboks squad. The flanker is joined by the wing Henno Mentz for next month's Tests against Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
