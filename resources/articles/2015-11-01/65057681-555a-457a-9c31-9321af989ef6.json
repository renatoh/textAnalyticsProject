This is a description most right-minded folk would agree with. The jeering came before last month\u2019s 2-1 victory over Sevilla. On Tuesday evening the Sky Blues are at the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n for the return Group D match. Asked about the governing body\u2019s deliberations over whether to charge the club, Kompany said: \u201cIt\u2019s a joke. We have played many games in Europe where there has been racial abuse and we have had to put up with it. And there have been times when we have been sanctioned in the same way as the team that was actually perpetrating those chants.\u201d Last October, City fans were banned from attending a group match at CSKA Moscow because of the Russian club\u2019s stadium ban for offences which included racist behaviour. Kompany said: \u201cIn Moscow we weren\u2019t allowed to have any support inside the stadium \u2013 I don\u2019t see what our fans did wrong. I have experienced it as well when I was a kid playing at Anderlecht, certain games in Europe where you had a lot of racial abuse. So in that sense this is not justifiable \u2013 there is nothing holy about the Champions League anthem. If something is happening and fans are not happy about it, they are allowed to show their discontent.\u201d There was only happiness and pride from within City ranks at the patience shown finally to defeat Alex Neil\u2019s stubborn Canaries who came to frustrate and nearly achieved the mission. The Scot set up his side in a 3-4-3 formation for the first time during his tenure and until halfway into the second half City failed to break them down. City missed the injured David Silva\u2019s creative genius but on 67 minutes Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi decided to intervene. The Argentinian had been a powerhouse in defence all afternoon. A display of tackling, anticipation and muscular intent was an illustration of why City took him from Valencia for \u00a332m. Goals from central defenders also help pay the bills. And when Kevin De Bruyne floated in a corner from the right Otamendi\u2019s towering leap and header past John Ruddy was the act of a thoroughbred. The home fans hoped a City goal glut would ensue. Instead Joe Hart produced a howler reminiscent of his struggles two seasons ago, dropping a regulation Robbie Brady cross for Cameron Jerome to equalise with seven minutes left. Kompany said: \u201cYou get those days. Joe hasn\u2019t set a foot wrong for us in a long, long time \u2013 it\u2019s good for him that it will be forgotten because the result was good, we won. In the end it was not a bad day to make a mistake.\u201d City had scored late winners against Crystal Palace, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Sevilla and they repeated the trick here. Raheem Sterling entered as an early second-half replacement and his goalbound shot was blocked by Russell Martin\u2019s arm. The visiting captain was sent off and Yaya Tour\u00e9 slammed in the winner from the penalty spot. Moments later Sterling claimed another penalty by drawing a trip from Brady. Tour\u00e9 had been replaced \u2013 a decision he seemed unhappy with as he exchanged words with Manuel Pellegrini \u2013 and Aleksandar Kolarov missed the spot-kick. It did not matter. The three points keeps City top above Arsenal on goal difference. Pellegrini said: \u201cI can\u2019t guess what will happen in the future. The important thing is for our team to understand that if you want to win the Premier League, you must try to play every game as a final. You can demonstrate that with the game we had here, and with what happened with Chelsea [who lost to Liverpool on Saturday], or United, who drew again [at Crystal Palace]. \u201cEvery game is a final because every team has very good players and all of them can win if you don\u2019t concentrate 10%. You know that every time you have to play against any team, especially away, both sides can win. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the best league in the world.\u201d Man of the match Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi (Manchester City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
