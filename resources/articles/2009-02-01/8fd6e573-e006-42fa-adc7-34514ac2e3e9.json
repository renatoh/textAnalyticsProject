Change is not always welcome in our rugby. Well, thank goodness for that nine o'clock special, the France\u2011Wales game that made up for one of the most woeful Saturdays of rugby in living memory. At least Scotland-Italy had nothing to live up to, having been billed as the wooden-spoon decider. The action was poor from the outset, but nothing was as sad as the sight of so many empty seats at Murrayfield. This was depressing rugby in a time of recession. Instead of lightening the mood, sport reflected these sombre times. What, for example, has happened to Mike Blair? The scrum-half, who after the autumn series was vying for the Lions No9 spot and maybe even the captaincy, had another game of hesitation and slow delivery. Italy, badly beaten yet again and struggling to reach the standard required for the championship \u2013 not that this Saturday did anything but lower the bar \u2013 still held in their ragged ranks the best player on display. Sergio Parisse was captain, tackler, yard-maker, inspiration and drop-goal kicker. He could not have done more. It was one of those weird days of parallels. In Edinburgh was Parisse, leading from the front, going to the back, clearing up and creating, while in Dublin Brian O'Driscoll was about to do the same for Ireland. He, too, dropped his goal, and he, too, was inspirational, taking full charge as the playmaker on a day when Ronan O'Gara found the expectation too much. O'Driscoll made a fabulous tackle to prevent England turning one of their numerous overlaps into a score. He made his runs, one stopped by a tap tackle from Steve Borthwick, another illicitly by Delon Armitage. He scored his try, ducking from close range between and under Nick Kennedy and Julian White. And he did all that while patently injured. O'Driscoll seems nowadays in a permanent state of pain on the field, but it takes an exceptional willpower to be able to hobble on and still be the most influential player on the field. And what of England? Oh dear. Martin Johnson made a career out of hiding what he truly felt about the game behind his furrowed brow. But on this day his exasperation was all too clear. Two more players in the bin: Phil Vickery for continuing to compete for the ball after he had dropped to his knees, with the referee, Craig Joubert, telling him all the while to move away; and Danny Care for charging in to deliver a cheap barge into Marcus Horan after the ball had been passed away from the breakdown. There is nothing in the world a coach or manager or tea-boy can do if a team spend a quarter of each match reduced to 14players. England may have had reason to complain about the treatment meted out to them in the Italy game. Certainly in the Wales game. But there can be no complaints about the binning here of their prop and scrum\u2011half. Perhaps the worst thing was that the addiction to yellow \u2013 10 now in the past four games \u2013 was not the most telling factor in this latest defeat. England managed to win plenty of ball and showed diligence in their phases, slightly mechanical perhaps and a bit slow, but effective nonetheless in the business of stretching Ireland's defence. White shirts outnumbered green on several occasions. Now came the simple bit, the conversion of an overlap into points: straighten the line of attack, draw the defenders one at a time, and pick them off with a pass. It never happened. Not once did Mark Cueto or Paul Sackey or Delon Armitage receive the pass that put them clear. Too many forwards got in the way. Joe Worsley once again tackled his heart out, but he simply cannot give a pass. England's one clean break, by replacement Mathew Tait, required the simplest of finishing touches. He had done the hard part, judging his run and angle sweetly, and all he needed to do was transfer quickly to Riki Flutey. Instead, he ran into Rob Kearney. At this central weekend of the Six Nations, the Saturday skills slumped. Too many experienced players \u2013 O'Gara was winning his 90th cap \u2013 allowed ancient antagonism to overheat them before the game had started. Too many players, yielding to fatigue, allowed themselves to slump back into the routines of club rugby. Forwards, for example, took the ball in contact, happy to be going to ground, invisible, rather than risk the offload. Too many times the ball was given to them, standing in positions perfect only for keeping defenders at bay. They were supposed to be decoys, a curtain behind which the real receivers might turn their tricks, but the ball kept coming to them. And off they would trundle into the tackle. Into the arms of Stephen Ferris, say, the wing forward who had an immense day doing the donkey work. He was excellent, but it was made too easy for him. The number of mismatches \u2013 England backs against Ireland forwards \u2013 was minute compared with the times a forward crashed into a forward. The catalogue of crisis points could go. But it would be too dispiriting, having made a wish that this Six Nations might be the first to swap tribal traps for bounding ambition, to go into the aerial exchanges. Neck-ache on top of a sorry heart made it only more miserable. Thank goodness, then, for Friday night in the championship. At last there was evidence of what Marc Li\u00e8vremont was trying to achieve: a new rush defence to replace the drift Wales were expecting; a pouring of forwards into the contact area to deny Wales swift possession; the relaunch of Imanol Harinordoquy's career; the discovery of Mathieu Bastareaud. And Wales, slightly easy, it would appear from the way France stopped Jamie Roberts and Shane Williams, to read now, and slightly prone to handling error in extremis. But still believing in themselves, still refusing to panic in the face of the unique pressure that can come with playing France in Paris. If you end the game with thrusts by Martyn Williams \u2013 and what a tackle it took on him by Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc \u2013 and Alun Wyn Jones finishing inches short of the line and victory, then your night's work has not been a total misery. Perhaps, as Warren Gatland has always stressed, Wales are nowhere near the finished article yet, and perhaps they will improve more rapidly now that the dream of back-to-back grand slams has been shattered, but they always seem to make rugby anything but flat. A Welsh crisis is a bumpy ride and a Welsh run of success can soar, even when it ends. The trouble is that two teams do not make a championship. There will never be six battling it out providing knife-edge thrillers at every turn, but the Six Nations needs more than a pair to keep it going. Ireland can still win the grand slam. They will have to shake off fear and rediscover the daring that took them to victory over France. The last thing the Six Nations needs is a side inching their way to a clean-sweep. Saturdays in March surely have to be better than that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
