An Auckland advertising copywriter brought a clown to his redundancy meeting, as first reported in the New Zealand Herald on Friday. New Zealand legally requires employers to allow workers the option of bringing a support person to serious disciplinary meetings, usually relating to an employee\u2019s prospective dismissal. After FCB New Zealand lost a significant client and began layoffs, Josh Thompson, who had reportedly been with the company for five months, received an ominous email from his bosses that read: \u201cBad news. We\u2019re having a meeting to discuss your role.\u201d Faced with the task of securing an appropriate support person for the potentially tense meeting, Thompson, a comedian who performs under the name Joshua Jack, said: \u201cI thought it\u2019s best to bring in a professional, and so I paid $200 and hired a clown.\u201d The clown, who Thompson refers to as \u201cJoe\u201d, crafted balloon animals throughout the meeting, including a poodle. His antics were squeaky, and Thompson\u2019s bosses had to request he quieten down several times. \u201cIt\u2019s further understood,\u201d reported the Herald, \u201cthat the clown mimed crying when the redundancy paperwork was handed over.\u201d A picture of the meeting, taken through a boardroom\u2019s glass doors by an unknown spectator, is of compromised quality, though one can detect that Joe, the clown, is wearing a colorful hat and a yellow bib, and that Thompson, leaning back in his chair, indeed looks relaxed for someone in the process of getting laid off. Thompson told Magic Talk radio: \u201cI mean, I did get fired, but apart from that it was all smooth running.\u201d Fortunately, Thompson will not be out of work for long. The Australian ad agency DDB confirmed Thompson will start a new role in its office next week. As of publishing, no reports have suggested what\u2019s next for Joe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
