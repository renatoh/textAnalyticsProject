But for me the overriding reason was personal. It was simply the gruelling nature of the work. Each and every day I had to delve deep into the most painful aspects of people's lives and examine their personal tragedies in detail. It was rare that I felt the outcome was not the best for the child, but this did not necessarily mean it was always good - just good enough, or the best under the circumstances. Sometimes this meant the permanent removal of a child from the birth family. Though I might feel certain this was the right decision (a child cannot be sacrificed to an abusive or neglectful life to spare the feelings of the adults concerned) this cannot overcome the grief the birth family will feel and will continue to feel for ever. For the last three years of my career I worked in the Brighton and Hove concurrency team. Three of us - all senior practitioners - began from scratch, basing the work on a model developed in the United States and brought to Britain by the Goodman project, part of the Manchester Adoption Society. The only other concurrency team in the country is run by the Thomas Coram Foundation in London. Concurrency is what it sounds - two plans in place at the same time: rehabilitating a child with the birth family, and adoption. A child for whom there are very serious concerns is placed with foster-adopters who will care for him or her until the court has the necessary evidence to recommend a permanent plan. Meanwhile, intensive work is carried out with the birth family assessing their capabilities and the areas of core concern. These issues are then addressed within timescales appropriate to the child, normally within nine months. It may be that, given five or 10 years, a parent can make enough changes to be able to parent successfully, but it is clearly not appropriate for a young baby to wait this long. If the goals can be achieved in time, then the child will be reintroduced into the family, if not, s/he will be adopted by the people who are already caring for her. This means there will be no further disruption of the child moving to another, adoptive placement. There are only a few children for whom concurrency is appropriate. The prognosis for family rehabilitation must be very low; this is assessed on clear criteria, such as parents with mental health problems, learning difficulties or drug addiction. The foster-adopters are committed to the child on a permanent basis, but prepared to give him up if it is in the child's best interest to be returned to the birth family. This commitment means they are able to form a very strong bond from the word go, which is clearly in the interest of the child. We cannot expect people to do this if the likelihood of rehabilitation is good. It is a hard process for the foster-adopters; \"emotional roller coaster\" is a phrase that keeps cropping up. The joy of a long awaited child, perhaps a very young baby straight from hospital, alongside the fear of losing them. They are also expected to bring the child to meet the birth family three or four times a week, without exception, for the duration of the assessment. The birth parents need to maintain a relationship with the child if they are to have any chance of rehabilitation, so the foster-adopters meet the birth parents briefly each time, handing over the child and being regularly faced with the insecurity of the relationship with that precious child. In Brighton and Hove there have so far been no children returned to the birth family. Manchester and Coram have produced one rehabilitation each. These low figures reflect the severe difficulties faced by the parents seen by the concurrency teams. As far as I was concerned, this was the perfect job in social work: a project I believed in passionately, which my two colleagues and I set up from scratch in a way we felt incorporated very high standards of working practice, with outcomes that were proved to be tremendously beneficial to the children involved. The job of assessing and supporting the foster-adopters was also one that I enjoyed, and it provided a balance to the child protection side and the ever-present court work. The adoption hearings were immensely satisfying too; it is not often in child protection social work there are such successful \"endings\" to a piece of work. But alongside this, the sadness of the birth parents remains. Most loved their children deeply and were prevented from caring for them by their own damaging experiences. A life in the care system, parental neglect or abuse had left them unable, not unwilling, to care for their children. In the end I could no longer face such grief, no matter how important I realise the work is and how much I am sure that an outcome is the right one for the child. For me, enough was enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
