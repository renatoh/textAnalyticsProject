Last night's match differed in three respects: it was in the League Cup rather than the FA Cup, it was first of two legs rather than a straight knock-out tie, and the opposition were Chelsea. You would not bet on Jose Mourinho's team buckling before the red-shirted onslaught in the way Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's did last spring. Though this Chelsea may never ravish the senses in the manner of a team containing Henry, Bergkamp and Pires, nor do they have the kind of temperamental inconsistency that perhaps stems from the French influence at Highbury. The English core supplied by John Terry, Frank Lampard and Wayne Bridge is surrounded by a polyglot group distinguished by no prevailing national characteristic, forming a powerful alloy capable of withstanding the sort of pressure United are used to exerting on ambitious would-be rivals. Last night Terry, Lampard and Bridge were joined by Joe Cole, making his 12th start of the season, and his third in a row. This, we were promised, is a reborn Cole, persuaded by Jose Mourinho of the virtues of helping to preserve the team's shape and of putting his foot in. The Portuguese manager clearly rates his No 10. When Mourinho does not like what he sees, as was the case with Hern\u00e1n Crespo, that player will not be hanging his shirt on a peg in the Chelsea dressing room for much longer. But Mourinho does believe in his own capacity to identify a player's true strengths and to help him make the most of them, as long as the player shows a desire to improve and an aptitude for absorbing instruction. One of Cole's greatest assets has always been his humility - a relative term when used in connection with a Premiership footballer, but justified in this case by the openness and keenness the player has shown since making his first impression at Upton Park. He could easily have been spoilt by all the attention and admiration. Instead, having discovered that a precocious talent did not guarantee success in the world of grown-ups, he has shown a consistent willingness to learn a more effective way of doing his job. Sven-Goran Eriksson liked him enough to keep him in his squad for two major competitions, but did not trust him sufficiently to bring him on as a wild card, a potential game-breaker, against Brazil in 2002 or against Portugal in Lisbon last summer. The latter occasion looked to some people like the epitaph for what had once been a career that promised to illuminate English football for a decade. His admirers will be hoping that Mourinho has acted in time to save Cole from a drift away from the centre of the action. The manager's strictures after a couple of flawed performances at the beginning of the season were probably designed, as much as anything, to see if the player's head would drop. When it did not, and when he started making a habit of coming on as a substitute and scoring vital goals, Mourinho appeared to come to the conclusion that here was a piece of clay worth the time and effort involved in moulding it into something precious. The first job was to teach Cole how to operate within the structure of a team that places a great emphasis on the transition from attack to defence. Working as part of the three-man midfield, behind two flexible wingers and a single striker, he did well enough to earn starts against Middlesbrough in the league last week and against Scunthorpe in the FA Cup on Saturday, earning praise for his readiness to do the unglamorous stuff. His reward came last night when, with Robben suspended, he was invited to move up into the position alongside Duff, wide on the right but ready to tuck in or even to combine with his partner on either flank in the style Chelsea have developed so profitably this season. Enthusiasm was more evident than finesse in the ninth minute when, having failed to connect with a dropping ball on the edge of the United area, he made amends by slide-tackling Wayne Rooney. Two minutes later the imaginative flick with which he delivered Terry's long clearance into the stride of Duff deserved something better than a drive from distance that flew past the angle. As in much of the match, the visitors were doing the pressing while the home side were hitting on the counter. Another Cole touch almost proved decisive after Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty appeal had been turned down, a piece of improvisation deceiving John O'Shea before Phil Neville came back to smother the break. There was another expression of Mourinho's faith 20 minutes into the second half, when Mateja Kezman was thrust into the fray in an attempt to provide the breakthrough. Only a few weeks ago, Cole would have expected his number to appear on the fourth official's board. This time the number was that of Tiago. Five minutes later, however, his time was up, although there was a warm hug from Mourinho as Cole left the pitch to allow Jiri Jarosik to make his debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
