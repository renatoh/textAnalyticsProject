Ten minutes before kick-off he dictated his first tranche: \" . . . the crowd gave new manager Peter Taylor a rousing ovation . . .\" Five minutes later Taylor took the pitch and they did. It roused him so much that he went beyond the arms aloft in the centre circle and ran off punching the air. Taylor is Hull's sixth manager in six years, excluding caretakers. In that time they have had four owners and six chairmen. Boothferry Park is one of the game's Bermuda triangles. Taylor is confident of not only keeping up appearances but improving them. The move in December to a new \u00a343.5m stadium can only help. \"I've always wanted to be a long-term manager,\" said Taylor, in his third post in a year. \"I look at Hull and see a lot of potential.\" The chairman Adam Pearson feels they will be good for each other. \"He is looking for stability in his cv and I'm looking to put stability into the club,\" said Pearson. \"We're desperate for it.\" So they might be. The programme does not list club officials - there is no knowing from day to day who they are. Taylor is something of an expert on new stadiums: he glimpsed the Walkers before Leicester sacked him a year ago, then resigned from Brighton, having taken them to the First Division in April, partly over plans for their proposed one at Falmer. \"The pictures look magnificent,\" he said of the Kingston Communications Stadium, owned by Hull city council, which they are to share with the rugby league club. The whole community is in this, which adds to the attraction for Taylor: if not England, which it was two years ago, then Hull. The city is at the cutting edge of communications technology and for years has been at the blunt edge of football. Here a manager might have a dalliance with Britney Spears and no one would sit up. At the last Boothferry game on December 14 the club are planning a Walk of Legends. Heads are being scratched to raise a quorum. Crowds average more than 8,000 and could rise to 25,000 in the new stadium. Another attraction is that the club are not in debt. Two years ago the manager Brian Little said: \"It's no good talking about promotion when we can't afford washing powder.\" His successor Jan Molby, lured from Kidderminster in April, managed two wins in 17 games and left them in 18th place. It would take four Taylors to fill Molby's shorts but he steps into the Dane's shoes with appreciation and hope. No one wanted the credit for Saturday's emphatic win, which stopped Rochdale going top. \"It was Billy's team,\" said Taylor, referring to the youth coach Russell, who prepared them. \"It was Jan's team,\" said Russell. \"That was how he wanted them to play.\" But criticising them in public frustration, as Peter Reid discovered at Sunderland, was no way to go on, however justified. Eight of them were Molby's players and Taylor liked what he saw. \"Once they settled and played with confidence the quality was clear. Goals change games. That's the beauty of football.\" Russell went further. \"Goals change careers but I've no magic secret. My side lost 7-1 this morning.\" Taylor, who officially takes over today, has a keen eye for Third Division players. He signed a fair few at Leicester, who have paid for it more dearly than he has. But the chairman is pleased with his signing. \"He would have walked here for the job,\" said Pearson. A walker? Perhaps Taylor is the legend they are looking for.
