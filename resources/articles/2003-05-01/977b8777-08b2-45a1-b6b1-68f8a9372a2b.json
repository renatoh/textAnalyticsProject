Piano Star, Hilbre Island and Unigold are the trio with the Blue Riband entry and it is the first-named who makes the most appeal of the three. The Sir Michael Stoute-trained colt ran a race brimful of promise when second on his racecourse debut to Ocean Silk at Chester's May meeting and should improve for the experience and the step up in trip today. The gossip from the gallops is that he has been working in fine style since. Hilbre Island was put in his place when down the field in another Derby trial at York last week and Unigold is not a certain stayer at this trip. The improving High Accolade and Inch Again are likely to prove more potent dangers along with comfortable Newmarket winner Westmoreland Road, but he looks more of a St Leger type and they all may lack the class of Piano Star (3.45). King Edward VII Stake entry Anani (3.15), whose Ascot win in March has been franked in no uncertain terms by those who finished behind him that day, still looks on a winning mark in the Tote Trifecta Showcase Handicap. The rains need to come to help Impersonator and Stoute's Tug Of Love is the obvious danger. Stoute sends out the favourite, Namroud, in the Newton Investment Handicap, the most interesting betting heat of the day. Namroud is considered well in off his current handicap mark by those close to the yard, which no doubt explains why his price is so short with some bookmakers for this ultra-competitive heat. However, he is very inexperienced, has a poor draw and on his bare form has a tough task at the weights. Ladbrokes want to take him on and offer 6-1. There are plenty of options among the better-drawn contenders, including last year's winner Omaha City and Finished Article, both of whom have good records around this idiosyncratic track. But both have styles of running which require luck in running and this may be the day for Thihn (2.40), who can lie handy in his races and has run two promising races in defeat this term. Provided he gets a clean break he should be in a good position for the run to the line in the straight. The best bet of the day is at Beverley, where Mark Johnston's The Persuader (5.10), one of his typically improving three-year-olds, won in such comfortable fashion at York last week that he seems sure to defy a 6lb penalty today. Tim Easterby's course-and-distance winner Tough Love (3.30) can make up for an unlucky run last time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
