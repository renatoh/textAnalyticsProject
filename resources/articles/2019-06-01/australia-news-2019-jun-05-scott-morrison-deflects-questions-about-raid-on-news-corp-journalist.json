Speaking to journalists in London, the prime minister endeavoured to avoid answering questions about the raid on the News Corp Sunday political editor Annika Smethurst\u2019s Canberra home, which came more than a year after she published a story about a top-secret proposal to broaden Australia\u2019s domestic surveillance capabilities. \u201cThese are matters for the AFP and not the government,\u201d he said. Despite repeated questions, including whether the government was seeking to expand the Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s powers to allow it to spy on Australian citizens domestically, which now sits outside its legal mandate, Morrison said he would not comment on \u201csecurity matters\u201d. Asked if it bothered him to see a journalist\u2019s home raided while speaking of the importance of freedom and democracy to Australia\u2019s allies, Morrison said he believed in those values but was unapologetic about the raid. \u201cAustralia believes strongly in the freedom of the press and we have clear rules and protections for the freedom of the press,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are also clear rules protecting Australia\u2019s national security and everybody should operate in accordance with all of those laws passed by our parliament \u2026 It never troubles me that our laws are being upheld.\u201d The raid on Smethurst\u2019s home, in which AFP officers accessed her phone and computer, came 14 months after she wrote a report pointing to correspondence between the home affairs departmental secretary and the defence departmental secretary proposing increasing the scope of Australia\u2019s surveillance agency. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who had won a fierce cabinet battle to establish the portfolio less than six months before, dismissed the story as \u201cnonsense\u201d, while the departmental heads released a statement rejecting the report. At the same time, the leak was referred to the AFP for investigation and, in the weeks after the article, both Dutton and his department head confirmed that discussions about the ASD\u2019s capabilities were continuing. The attorney general, Christian Porter, rejected allegations the government was behind the raid on Smethurst\u2019s home as \u201cutterly untrue\u201d on Wednesday. Speaking to ABC radio, he said he had been unaware of it in advance, but conceded that Dutton, as the home affairs minister, may have known. While concerns about attacks on public interest journalism swirl at home, Morrison was also dealing with tensions between the UK and the US over reports Britain may allow Huawei to build part of its 5G infrastructure, despite fellow Five Eyes partners, including Australia, moving to lock the Chinese telco out of their networks. Australia shares intelligence with Britain, the US, Canada, New Zealand and the UK as part of the Five Eyes partnership. In 2018 Australia banned Huawei from building its 5G network, following advice from domestic security agencies. Australia has stepped up its assistance for the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea in building an internet cable, supplanting Huawei\u2019s own offer, after concerns about Beijing\u2019s \u201csoft diplomacy\u201d tactics. Asked if all Five Eye partners should have a consistent approach to dealing with Huawei, given its potential involvement in Britain\u2019s network, Morrison said those questions were \u201cmatters for other sovereign governments\u201d. \u201cThe matter when we considered it was done in accordance with Australia\u2019s national interest and based on our own considerations. It is a sovereign matter for each and every government to make decisions in relation to its own national security and that would be the case for any one of the members of that group or any other nation.\u201d Morrison\u2019s visit to the UK coincided with that of the US president, Donald Trump, and growing escalations in trade conflicts between the Trump administration and traditional trading partners, including China. The prime minister said it was in the interests of all the countries involved that tariff issues be \u201cresolved well and positively\u201d between themselves. But in a speech to the Australia-UK Chamber of Commerce, Morrison espoused the benefits of the World Trade Organisation as the \u201cbest foundation we have for securing continued prosperity in a fast-changing world\u201d and called for a dispute resolution process. \u201cSo we must remain committed to this task, to allow commercial society to flourish, to allow the people in this room \u2013 the entrepreneurs, the employers, the risk takers \u2013 to make the investment decisions so vital to future prosperity,\u201d he said, in a speech reported by Australian Associated Press. \u201cIt is critical, therefore, that like-minded countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom, lend their support to WTO reform \u2013 to mend, not end, the rules-based trading system.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
