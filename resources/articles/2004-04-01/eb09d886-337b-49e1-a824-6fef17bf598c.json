But not even he can escape the evil clutches of Aleem Dar and his follow-through obsession. He's issued four warnings in this game so far - two each to Harmison (who then received a fatal third from umpire Hair) and the crazed Best. That's a maiden and that's tea. Join me at 8.10pm UK time for coverage of the final session. 5th over: England 10-0 (Trescothick 5, Vaughan 4) Vaughan works Best through square-leg for two, then has to suffer a wild stare for no apparent reason. Vaughan then gloves a single to fine leg, which prompts Best to brush past him at the non-striker's end. Trescothick takes another single to midwicket, before mistimes a pull that goes down off his thigh pad and not too far away from Sarwan at short leg. Josh Robinson joins the Flintoff debate. \"I imagine he's somewhat grateful for the rest. I'll bet he's hoping he won't have to bat again at least until after lunch tomorrow.\" 4th over: England 6-0 (Trescothick 4, Vaughan 1) Vaughan scores the first run off the bat with a pull for one to long leg off Edwards. Trescothick then gets going by hammering a full-toss behind point for four. \"My girlfriend and I were watching the DVD collection of \"All Creatures Great and Small\" she had borrowed from the library (is there any better way to make yourself homesick I wonder?) when the episode with a cricket match comes on,\" says Nick Johnston. \"Tristan (PD) pretends to be injured so that James has to play against the apparently ferocious bowling of the next village (maybe he liked the look of the Dr Who attack). It looks shocking when you watch it, but it can't be easy going from filming sticking a hand into a cows nether regions to trying to recreate tense village cricket.\" So it wasn't Doctor Who, then? I'm confused now. 3rd over: England 1-0 (Trescothick 0, Vaughan 0) Best is convinced Trescothick gloved one down the leg-side to Ridley Jacobs, but umpire Hair remains impassive. Replays suggest Tresco was lucky to get away with that one, even if the deflection was very slight. \"If they're not going to open with Flintoff, maybe they should send him in first wicket down,\" suggests Andrew Cosgrove. \"You know, give the man 10 minutes to get his breath back, have a drink of water, that sort of thing.\" I reckon the law of averages dictates that Freddie will fail this time round. So we might as well prolong his appearance for as long as possible. 2nd over: England 1-0 (Trescothick 0, Vaughan 0) This is a huge innings for England's two openers, who have totalled 183 runs between them in 14 knocks in the series. On the whole, they've both been getting themselves out, which they simply mustn't do on this pitch. Edwards bowls a maiden to Vaughan. \"It was (I think) the night England went out to Germany in Euro 96,\" reminsces David Lea. \"This being Liverpool, a few of us went out to drown our indifference. Visiting the Gents' at one particular nightspot I noticed two blokes in identical suits, who looked like Shaquille O'Neal's taller, more muscular brothers, come in and stand by the door. Averted gaze hurriedly. Seconds later, the only empty space at the trough, next to me, was taken up by what I noticed to be a slight, curly haired, rather older-than-the-average punter in a purple corduroy jacket and shades. Duties complete, I squeezed past the Shaqs and left. Our table faced the gents door, so when I saw the three emerging and heading to the VIP room, such as it was, it struck me. This was Bob Dylan. He'd played the Empire that night.\" Great stuff! 1st over: England 1-0 (Trescothick 0, Vaughan 0) Best's first ball is signalled by Umpire Hair after he sends a looping bouncer over Marcus Trescothick's right shoulder. Only 20 minutes to go before tea. Earlier I asked Julia Blyth how she knew that Dermot Reeve had a pierced nipple. \"Because, dear Lawrence, he has shown me,\" she answers, matter-of-factly. \"The stuff that happens inside a Channel 4 commentary box; my god, you just wouldn't believe. It's like Sodom and Gomorrah sometimes.\" Blimey. I'm not sure we've reached the watershed yet... 7.24pm Minor correction: there are 48 overs to go today, making it 138 in all to survive. Here we go. Wish them luck. 7.22pm \"Wouldn't it now be a reasonble decision to send Flintoff out to open the batting,\" writes Wayne Lovett. \"I mean he's got his eye in and all.\" It's not a bad shout, Wayne. But, no, here come Vaughan and Trescothick. 7.15pm So, England will have to survive 47 more overs today, followed by another 90 tomorrow - that's 137 in all. It's tough, but not impossible, because the pitch is playing well and the bowlers will be a little weary after sending down 99 overs in the last day and a bit. A lot could depend on whether England's openers can finally score some runs. WICKET! Jones lbw b Hinds 11 (285 all out) And that, as they say, is that. Jones is trapped on the back foot by Hinds, leaving Flintoff unbeaten on 102. They will surely now follow on, a massive 466 behind. 98th over: England 284-9 (Flintoff 101, Jones 11) The England fans are giving Best some stick on the fine-leg fence, but Best just gives them a broad grin. Quite right too. Flintoff pushes Collymore's second ball to long-off for a single, which is showing a great deal of faith in the wounded Jones, who is now wearing an arm-guard on his left arm as well as his right. 97th over: England 283-9 (Flintoff 100, Jones 11) Predictably, Best gives Jones a bouncer first ball, followed by some invective. Best beats Jones next ball, and seems to shout \"bowling!\" as he follows through, rather in the way his great-uncle Carlisle Best, who used to bat in West Indies middle order, would commentate on his own shots. Next ball, Best picks up his second warning from Aleem Dar for running on the pitch, but Best is undeterred and sends down a hig full-toss which almost cuts Jones in two. Words are exchanged. Lively stuff. \"I've just returned from lunch to see Marc Lawrence's Peter Davison (no 'd') story,\" writes John Steele. \"Davison did indeed play cricket in an episode of Doctor Who. In 'Black Orchid' from 1982, he not only took several wickets with his rather slow 'fast' bowling, but scored a match-winning innings. Not really a highpoint in the history of the programme.\" WICKET! Harmison b Best 5 (283-9) Harmison is beaten by a straight one from Best, who is rather pleased with himself. But here comes Jones! 96th over: England 283-8 (Flintoff 100, Harmison 5) I think we'll have to work on the basis that Jones won't bat again in this innings, unless these two hang around long enough for his forearm to recover. That was a real shame for England, because he and Flintoff had batted for an hour after lunch and were making the Windies work hard. Meanwhile, Flintoff plays out a Collymore maiden. \"I've never seen any cricketers micturating but I know for a solid gold fact that Dermot Reeve has a pierced nipple,\" reports Julia Blyth. \"Will that do?\" It certainly will, Julia. Dare I ask how you know this? 95th over: England 283-8 (Flintoff 100, Harmison 5) Steve Harmison is off the mark first ball with a quick single to mid-off, before Flintoff takes a leg-bye. Harmison then pulls Best for four with astonishing skill for a No11. Best is so gobsmacked that, for once, he is completely lost for words. 6.50pm Simon Jones has left the field retired hurt after being hit on the forearm by Tino Best. That's a blow for England. 94th over: England 277-8 (Flintoff 100, Jones 11) There's Flintoff's third Test century, which he reaches with a neat tuck for two through square-leg off Collymore. He might have been dropped three times - one of them an outrageous cock-up by Lara - but that's a well-deserved hundred, off 209 balls. Interestingly, the boundary-count of 11 fours and two sixes (56 runs in total) is lower than you might expect from Freddie, which suggests he's working the ball around more than he used to. \"You must have relished the WI first innings (and inwardly breathed a sigh of relief) given that you poured a rather large vat of scorn on some poor punter who plumped for a four-nil to England,\" remembers Tristan Haley-Burrows. \"My friend once saw Rick Witter of Shed Seven 'fame' fall into a puddle of urine in a nightclub toilet in Liverpool. It may have been the same guy who went to school with Michael Vaughan, but I can't honestly recall.\" 93rd over: England 275-8 (Flintoff 98, Jones 11) Flintoff hits Edwards's second ball to deep extra for a single, leaving Jones with a maximum of four balls to keep out. A comedy leave-alone (remember Courtney Walsh and Jack Russell?) and he survives. Martin Duckworth has just sent me a near-libellous email about a well-known comedian and some illegal substances, so I shall have to leave it at that. Shame, really. 92nd over: England 274-8 (Flintoff 97, Jones 11) Lovely shot from Flintoff, who moves to 97 with a classy drive through midwicket for four as Collymore for once strays onto his pads. A leg-bye, brings Jones onto strike and he picks up two more off the inside edge through square-leg. The last ball of the over brings a repeat - bonus runs for England as Jones moves into double-figures. \"Please find out what happened to the Welly [in Hull],\" writes Neil Evans. \"I didn't get thrown up on by Roland Gift there, but did meet the girl I've been married to for the past seven years. However, I did bump into Roland buying some nice looking fish on Newland Avenue.\" 91st over: England 265-8 (Flintoff 93, Jones 7) Flintoff turns down three easy singles off Edwards to protect Jones, but then moves to 93 with one off the inside edge to square-leg. This stand is just starting to annoy Lara and co now, despite the lead of 486. \"Pursuing the urination theme to its logical yet puerile end, I'd like to relate a celeb vomit story,\" writes Mark Simon. \"Back in 1992, me and a couple of mates were travelling round France by train and pitched up in Cap Ferret. Who should be staying at our low-rent hostel than none other than Terry Duckworth from Corrie, or 'Nige' Pevaro to his mates. One night we all overdid it on the local ros\u00e9 (served in used Evian bottles, nice), and staggered down to the beach the next morning for a game of cleansing beach footy. Terry/Nige was in goal, shagged out, having spent three minutes charging around the pitch like a three-year-old on IV Sunny Delight. My mate Romik (goalhanging for the other side) ended up being sick over the pile of sand that was one of the goal-posts and splattering our new celeb mate. Terry/Nige was not impressed, particularly when my mate tried to blame it on the eggs Terry had cooked us all that morning.\" That really is a lovely story, Mark. Thank you. 90th over: England 264-8 (Flintoff 92, Jones 7) Corey Collymore comes into the attack, and beats Jones a couple of times before Jones runs him through the slip cordon for two runs. He's playing patiently here - just what England need. \"I bet they've run out of new balls,\" writes Richard Jones. \"Only used a maximum of four in all the other Tests. Some poor sod is down the shop buying one now.\" 89th over: England 262-8 (Flintoff 92, Jones 5) Fidel Edwards takes the new ball from the other end, and Flintoff pulls his second ball into the fences at long leg for six to bring up the 250. Freddie's going for it now and hammers Edwards for four with an uppish square-cut. The field is spread here, which is giving Flintoff licence to hit the ball through in the infield in the air. Edwards oversteps, before Flintoff drives him down the ground for two. The last ball of the over is deposited over mid-on for four. Great stuff: 17 off the over and Freddie needs eight for his century. \"I once shared a urinal with Reg Varney of On The Buses,\" reports John Pooley, stretching the definition of celebrity somewhat. 88th over: England 245-8 (Flintoff 76, Jones 5) This pitch is still playing very easily, and Jones goes onto the back foot to push Collins to point and steal a risky single, which he completes with his bat almost fatally in the air. Flintoff takes one more with a lofted cover-drive, and that prompts the second new ball, seven overs after it became available. Collins immediately puts down a relatively simple caught-and-bowled chance off Jones, then sends down an off-side wide. Jones rubs salt into the wound by edging him through the slips for two. \"I was amused to note that Neil Appleton had weed over Roland Gift's foot,\" chuckles Alan Moore to himself. \"I was vaguely acquainted with young Ronald at Hull, and he once puked over my foot. Does anyone remember the Wellington Club in said city? What happened to it?\" 87th over: England 240-8 (Flintoff 75, Jones 2) A maiden from Hinds to Flintoff, who is watchful under the peak of his blue helmet. \"I once had the pleasure of occupying the urinal next to Terry Waite,\" writes Paul Birrell. \"It was an almighty struggle not to ask him if it was a relief to be able to go to the loo without first asking permission. He's a very big man. That is, in stature.\" Am I the only one, or is this riff slightly gender exclusive (to coin a phrase)? 86th over: England 240-8 (Flintoff 75, Jones 2) The other point about keeping the Windies in the field for as long as possible is that it will tire out their bowlers before the second innings. England faced a similar situation against Sri Lanka at Lord's in 2002, when they followed on miles behind, then racked up 500 second time round. Flintoff eases Collins to extra cover for a single, before Jones escapes the strike with a leg-bye. Freddie then miscues a leg-side heave which brings him a safe-enough single. \"I once stood next to Bob Holness at the urinals at Watford Gap (northbound),\" says Andrew Hockley. \"I resisted the temptation to make a gag about 'having a P'.\" You did well there, Andrew. 85th over: England 237-8 (Flintoff 73, Jones 2) It's a gloriously hot day in Antigua, so the weather ain't going to save England here. Hinds continues with his unthreatening left-arm spin, and Flintoff pushes him oh-so-easily to long-on for a single. \"I once stood next to Shakin' Stevens in the boys room,\" says Steve Light. \"The trauma has yet to recede.\" 84th over: England 236-8 (Flintoff 72, Jones 2) Pedro Collins goes in search of his fifth wicket, but he gets no change out of Jones, who gets behind the line to play out a maiden. \"I was at a lunch with a client at posh Knightsbridge restaurant Isola when nature called,\" reports Jonathan Hawkins. \"Entering the toilet I was confronted by a line of urinals, only one of which was spare. The fact that this spare receptacle was flanked by a weeing Neil Tennant and David Furnish was bad enough, but the fact that there was insufficient space to easily take my place, made the situation even trickier. Fortunately, however, they understood the universal signal of the quiet cough, and parted slightly to accommodate me, as it were.\" Ah, the quiet cough. It never fails. 83rd over: England 236-8 (Flintoff 72, Jones 2) Right, there are 66 overs to go today, and another 90 tomorrow: that's 156 overs and 12 wickets to go. Ryan Hinds opens the bowling after lunch as Lara spurns the chance to take the second new ball, and Simon Jones pushes his first delivery to extra cover for a single. Flintoff sweeps the last ball fine for four. \"Oh, and how would you rate England's chances of saving a draw at this point?\" asks Josh Robinson. \"I reckon that if they can hold out until tea, I'd back them to do so; another hour after lunch and they've got a fair chance; much less than that and it might be over tonight.\" I wouldn't have thought these last two wickets will last more than half an hour, Josh. Then it'll be a struggle. 5.48pm Apparently the reason for the late resumption is that the players now get their full 40 minutes at lunch. So if the last over before the interval eats into the break, as it did today, the afternoon session starts correspondingly late. \"At the inaugural Test at Chester-le-Street last summer,\" writes Andrew Stroud, \"I found myself in the Gents at the same time as none other than Simon Hughes, of jargon-debunking, Analyst fame (and medium pace county journeyman for Middlesex and Durham, of course). It would appear that his analysis doesn't stretch to the possibilities of any impurities or germs left on his hands after taking a leak, as he left the Gents without a visit to the wash basin on the way.\" 5.46pm England are 231-8, about 7,465 runs behind the Windies. \"Modern English cricket is about England fighting a long and ultimately fruitless struggle for a draw, after the opposing team posts a huge 600 plus first innings score against them, not this winning nonsense we've been seeing recently,\" complains David Bates. \"Now I feel like the world is right again - a bit like 'Dallas' when Bobby Ewing suddently appeared in the shower after being dead for years.\" 5.44pm Welcome back. Your urinating-next-to-a-celeb stories have been pouring in, so to speak. Here's Marc Lawrence. \"I was in Soho House and Peter Davidson, ex-Doctor Who and All Creatures star was to my right emptying his bladder, presumably full of champagne or whatever stuff actors drink in these private establishments,\" he reports. \"I've no idea whether he likes cricket though.\" I think he once played cricket on an episode of something or other. He was hilariosuly cast as a demon bowler and slip catcher."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
