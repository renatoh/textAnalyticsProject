The figure of the lovelorn clown was present both in the music and on stage as Pierrot emerged to gaze at the luminous moon projected behind the ensemble. Yet if anything, the theatrical aspect of this programme wasn't fully realised, and this remained a largely straight concert performance, apart from Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire. Sally Beamish's Commedia, a music theatre piece based on stock characters and situations of the commedia dell'arte tradition, is a slight work with the pantomime aspect entirely convincingly expressed in the music. Helen Grime's Seven Pierrot Miniatures, a new work written in response to poems by Albert Giraud (also drawn on by Schoenberg for his Pierrot Lunaire), was brief but rich in interesting contrasts. Grime's chamber pieces express a dreamlike tranquillity one minute and explosive brutality the next, reflecting the mercurial nature of Schoenberg's own settings. Contrast was also provided by juxtaposition: the spare, ascetic beauty of Debussy's Cello Sonata was a startling glance back to the music of an earlier era placed as it was between the works by Beamish and Grime, and Chopin's C sharp minor Waltz, Op 64 No 2, which acted as a prelude to Pierrot. French actress Sylvie Rohrer took the part of Pierrot in the Schoenberg, tending towards the speaking side of the speak-singing directions. It was a curiously muted performance, the mime gestures not entirely compensating for the limited vocal inflections. The colours and nuances were all in the instrumental ensemble whose performance brought out the multifaceted detail of Schoenberg's score."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
