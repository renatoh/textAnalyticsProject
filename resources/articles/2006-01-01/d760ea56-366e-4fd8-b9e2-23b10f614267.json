In this week's consumer test, we look at the best way to release the cash locked up in a home, while avoiding the pitfalls that gave equity release such a bad name in the early 1990s. Put simply, equity release schemes allow homeowners who have paid off their mortgage to borrow money against the value of their house. The loan carries no repayments in the short term but is usually repaid when the borrower dies, or moves into sheltered accommodation. The rises in property values coupled with declining pension incomes has produced an upsurge of interest from cash-poor, but asset-rich pensioners keen to realise some of the value of their property. Last year more than 26,650 plans worth a combined \u00a31.2bn were sold. But tread very carefully. The consumer group Which? is highly critical of equity release schemes, describing them last month as the choice \"of last resort\". It quoted figures on the cost of such schemes that would have put off all but the most hardened investors. So, do they offer good value for homeowners, and those set to inherit any money left in their estate? The first point is that the best way of realising cash from a property is to sell it and buy a cheaper house. All other schemes involve complex financing arrangements, fees and obligations. Anyone thinking of equity release should seriously consider selling first. With this in mind, we look at the other options. We have taken the example of Kathleen Steer who lives in a large five-bedroom house near Bromley in Kent, valued at around \u00a3800,000. She is looking to raise \u00a3200,000 against the value of her house to pay for repairs and provide extra income. She is a 67-year old widow who smokes, but is fighting fit and plays golf regularly. She says she expects to be around \"for some time yet\". She has three children and wants to stay in her house for at least another 10 years before she considers downsizing. \"I know the best thing to do is to buy a smaller house now but I enjoy living here and don't want to move yet. We bought the house a long time ago (in 1976) and it has shot up in value. I sort of feel that I gained this money through great fortune, and in some ways it's there to be spent,\" she says. We asked equity release specialists Key Retirement Solutions to cost her options. We also asked equity release cynic Mark Dampier of the IFA Hargreaves Lansdown to come up with other options. Lifetime mortgage If Kathleen takes out a \"lifetime\" mortgage, she gets the cash up front but does not have to make any monthly payments. Instead, the interest is added to the amount borrowed and paid back when she sells up or dies. Key Retirement's Dean Mirfin says the lowest fixed rate currently available on this type of scheme is 5.89% (fixed for life) available through GE Life. He says her desired loan of \u00a3200,000 will rise to around \u00a3354,000 after 10 years - which she would have to repay by selling the house. \"With these type of loans the amount owed doubles every 11-13 years depending on the rate of interest,\" he says. \"This means she would owe around \u00a3470,000 if she decided to stay in the house for 15 years. At just short of 20 years - when she is 87 - the entire value of the house will probably be owed to the loan company, assuming the house value remains at around \u00a3800,000.\" The advantage of such schemes is that they can be paid off at any stage and are not affected by fluctuations in the property market. If house prices rise, then she benefits. If values fall, she will not go into negative equity due to the \"no negative equity guarantee\" which comes with all SHIPs (Safe Home Income Plans). The disadvantage of such schemes is that the longer she stays in the house after she has taken out the loan, the more her family's inheritance is eaten up. If she changes her mind and decides to stay for 20 years, they would get nothing. If she is happy to take the initial \u00a3200,000 loan as a series of staged payments, this will bring down the amount owed. To set up such a scheme costs around \u00a3600 in arrangement fees alone. The GE Life loan can be repaid without any early repayment charges after 10 years, and as such is probably her best option - but only if she is definitely going to sell after 10 years. Home Reversion The chief alternative to a lifetime mortgage is a home reversion plan. By going down this route, Kathleen effectively sells a proportion of her property to raise the amount she requires. There are no monthly payments and no interest rolls up. The loan company makes its money by offering her the loan in return for a proportion of the house's value on sale. In Kathleen's case, to raise the \u00a3200,000 she would need to hand over ownership of approximately 58% of her \u00a3800,000 property, or \u00a3464,000 at its current value. There are a number of providers of these schemes, all offering similar rates. The overall cost of raising the \u00a3200,000 over time is then linked to the future value of her property. For example, if after 10 years her property has increased in value to \u00a31.2m, the reversion plan provider owns a share in the property of 58% or \u00a3696,000. Were her property to fall in value, the provider would still receive 58% of its value when sold. If the value fell to \u00a3600,000, the provider would be entitled to \u00a3348,000. The main advantage of such a plan is that it offers far more certainty, irrespective of property values in the future. The loan provider is entitled to only 58%. Upon her death, the amount left for inheritance is known, and unlike option one, the loan's cost does not grow over time. Such loans are also portable. If Kathleen moves to a smaller house after, say 15 years, she would hand over 58% of the surplus created by the sale, and the same proportion of the sale of her new house, when that is sold. The main disadvantage is that it is a very expensive way of borrowing the money over a short period. Also if the value of the property rises substantially, the gain has to be shared with the loan company. Home reversion plans are not FSA regulated, but will be soon, although borrowers can take out a SHIP-regulated plan in confidence. The other options If Kathleen balks at the figures quoted in lifetime mortgage and home reversion plans, but decides that she still cannot face clearing out the attic and wants to remain in the family home, what are her other options? For a more cynical view of the equity release market, we approached Mark Dampier, head of research with the independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown. He has been critical of equity release plans after looking into them on behalf of his mother. He was particularly concerned at the effect compound interest has on equity levels, particularly when combined with the high level of fees that can accompany such plans. Having been given very basic details about Kathleen's case, he suggested that she was probably too young to take out an equity release plan - on the basis that she could easily live for a further 20-25 years. \"I think she should use equity release as an absolute last option and preferably when she is into her 80s. Redemption charges are usually high and should she suddenly need to move into a nursing home or to move out of the house, she will have to deal with the mortgage company too - none of the things I particularly want to do when I am elderly.\" He reiterates the need to think carefuly about selling up and moving to a smaller house -the preferred option - although he concedes that people do become emotionally attached to their homes. He has, however, come up with two further choices. First, she could rent part of her house. \"I would imagine that she could get \u00a3300 a month from students or professional people renting a room. I realise she would be giving up some of her privacy, but if she felt able to let out three rooms, this would secure her an additional income of \u00a310,800 a year,\" he says. Another option would be for the children to step in and help their mother out. \"I have no idea as to the children's financial position. However, if we presume this is their potential inheritance, then they should consider looking after the asset. Perhaps they could pay for some of the repairs or possibly give some annual income to their mother.\" Lastly, he warns Kathleen to consider very carefully how much money she really needs for repairs and living. \"The problem is that \u00a3200,000 does not actually generate a huge amount of income any more. If we take a building society account, the best she can obtain is something in the region of 4.8% gross, and in my view interest rates are far more likely to go down than up.\" What they will charge you Equity release plans are complex products and anyone thinking of taking one out is advised to talk to a specialist IFA, and to take the loan from a SHIP (Safe Home Income Plans) member. Key Retirement Solutions has produced a free guide to equity release: call 0800 064 70 75 or go to keyretirement.co.uk. These products carry substantial fees. All loan providers require a survey of the property, costing around \u00a3300. Lifetime mortgages typically attract arrangement fees of \u00a3600 and solicitor's fees of around \u00a3500 - assuming they are used to dealing with equity release. Home reversion plans do not incur set-up charges, but the solicitor's fees are \u00a3100-\u00a3200 higher. Your IFA should offer the choice of paying for their advice (2% of the loan with 1% often paid back as commission) or by allowing them to take their commission from the loan company. The former could easily add \u00a32,000 to a big loan, although it can be added to the total borrowed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
