Carlo Cudicini takes his place in a team which hasn't been named yet. Other reports are suggesting it's an ankle injury, but we're not listening to them and are sticking with the knee. So assume it's an ankle injury. Avram the Affectionate Lapdog from the Churchill adverts (\"Oh yehyehyehyehyehyehyehyeh\") goes with Kalou instead of Anelka: Cudicini, Ferreira, Carvalho, Terry, Ashley Cole, Ballack, Makelele, self-facilitating midfield node Lampard, Kalou, Drogba, Joe Cole. Subs: Hilario, Essien, Malouda, Wright-Phillips, Alex, Belletti, Anelka. On the one hand, Olympiakos have lost all seven games they've played on these shores; on the other, they've won at Werder Bremen and Lazio this season: Nikopolidis, Zewlakow, Julio Cesar, Antzas, Pantos, Ledesma, Patsatzoglou, Torosidis, Djordjevic, Stoltidis, Kovacevic. Subs: Sifakis, Leonardo, Nunez, Mendrinos, Konstantinou, Belluschi, Sisic. The bloke who took charge of the 2005 Liverpool-Milan final: Manuel Enrique Mejuto Gonzalez (Spain) Kick off is at 7.45pm. Anticipation rocketing through the roof, right here, right now: \"I'm looking forward to an exciting game of lateral passing and watertight defending,\" chirps Richard Tucker. Ah, that's the spirit. The more we talk this one down, the better the chances of a rollercoaster balanced on top of a see-saw. Here's to the best entertainment this side of Frank TV: nine goals, please! Where's Hilario dept: \"How is Petr Cech injured and Cudicini fit?\" asks Tom Prankard. \"Don't they usually get knacked as a pair?\" That is true. Hilario must have been quaking in his loafers when he heard Cech had jiggered himself and might have to actually do something for the stipend he trousers. Perhaps he keeps Cudicini wrapped in cotton wool in a box under the stairs by way of insurance. The teams are out. Whoever is in charge of the Stamford Bridge Dansette decks wants to get his gameface on. The official Uefa bastardisation of Zadok the Priest is blazing out of one speaker, Blue Is The Colour pumping from the other. Handel isn't supposed to be accompanied by an oompah bassline, it's just not on. And we're off! Terry gets on the end of a long ball into the Olympiakos box, but his header isn't going anywhere near the goal. 2 min: Drogba races towards the box and feeds the ball forward to Joe Cole, six yards out. He swivels and rolls a soft shot past Nikopolidis and onto the right-hand post. The ball bounces back to Drogba three yards out... and with the goal gaping he sidefoots over! It doesn't matter, because Cole is flagged for offside, but still, what a ridiculous miss. 4 min: GOAL!!! Chelsea 1-0 Olympiakos. Chelsea have started very brightly - Joe Cole and Salomon Kalou both send dangerous balls into the box which are nervously hacked clear by visiting defenders. Then Lampard swings a ball into the box from the left: Ballack is on his own six yards out, and he heads home with ease. Great start by Chelsea, a woeful one by Olympiakos. 7 min: Torosidis makes a run into the Chelsea half and slips the ball to Djordjevic on the left, but the cross is deep into the stand. That is pretty poor. Pantos has been yellow carded for whacking Ferreira, by the way. 9 min: A terrible free kick from Lampard out right allows Olympiakos to swarm forward from deep inside their own half, but instead of attempting to pass it to each other, whichever goon picked up the ball - sorry, I couldn't make out who it was - elects to skelp it upfield, where only Carvalho and Ashley Cole are milling about. That was spectacularly witless. Olympiakos are not impressing anyone here. 13 min: That's a bit better from the visiting side: Torosidis robs the ball off a ponderous Kalou in the centre circle, strides forward, and bowls a delicious ball from the inside right channel down the corridor of uncertainty. Sadly for him, none of his team-mates have bothered to shift their arses, and the ball goes to waste. But at least that's something; what's gone before has been abysmal. \"So the latest hot chat round Fulham Broadway way is about Cech, is it?\" asks Colm Devlin. I don't know, Colm, I was making it up. \"I live in the area and was there both today and yesterday - and heard absolutely nothing. Zilch. You never see the players around as they all live in stockbroker belt and their training ground is in the sticks out Cobham way. And Stamford Bridge itself is like a bleeding fortress. Everywhere I turn in fact I hear so many Spanish accents that I presume the chat is about Casillas instead.\" 17 min: Drogba seems hell bent on trying to hoof the ball all the way to the branch of Bodeans near the tube. Once again he welts an effort high over the bar from close range, this time slicing a low Joe Cole left-wing cross high into the stands. \"Has everybody realised that Frank Lampard seems to be promoting a book called Totally Rank?\" asks Adam Tildsley, showing utter contempt for a tome which, in fairness, flew off the shelves by the tens. 22 min: There's been a strange lull. Chelsea are enjoying Stamford the Lion's share of the ball, but aren't creating much. Olympiakos for their part seem happy enough to steady the ship. As things stand they only need one goal, after all, to win the tie. Meanwhile here's another email abusing Frank Lampard, which is not the sort of thing I want to encourage, not at all. \"What in the name of god is Frank wearing in that picture?\" splutters Jeff Woodman. \"Is he a stunt-double for Miami Vice in the off season?\" 24 min: LAMPARD HAS THE LAST LAUGH! Chelsea 2-0 Olympiakos. Kalou, then Joe Cole, heads the ball towards the Olympiakos box down the inside right channel. The second header springs the visiting back line and finds Ballack, who hammers in a shot from a tight angle. It's well saved by Nikopolidis, yet all he can really do is parry the ball across the face of goal towards Lampard, who runs the ball into an empty net from a yard out with his fancy white boot that has some sort of inscription about scoring a lot of goals on it. Which, to be fair, he does. Look! 29 min: Chelsea are so comfortable they'll probably come out for the second half sporting paisley-patterned silk gowns. Olympiakos can't get the ball, and the home side are happy to stroke it about in an insouciant manner. They're not pressing forward hard, though: the sense of a job done is palpable. \"I'm not one to praise anyone wearing Chelsea blue, but surely someone must have noticed that Michael Ballack has been their best player since December?\" writes Liban Saleh, adding a smidgen of analysis to an otherwise barren report. \"He's pretty much kept Chelsea fighting on all fronts this season until Avr... sorry, Roman's witless decision to include Frank Lampard at Ballack's expense in the first 11 in the Carling Cup final ended their interest there.\" 32 min: Joe Cole has a dig from just outside the box on the right. He's following Drogba's lead in trying to hoof it out of the ground. They've obviously had a bet with each other to see if anyone can get the ball down to Wandsworth Bridge. \"I am a big fan of Frank's but defending him is sometimes difficult,\" writes Chris Turner. \"Is this his second book?\" The second one he's sold, yes. \"Presumably nothing about humiliating Spanish women in this one, unless you count his wife having to accompany him on publicity stunts.\" 37 min: It's gone very, very, very quiet at Stamford Bridge, bar one strident Londoner opining that Pantos, who is lingering awhile over a throw, is a \"wankaaaah\". This is over. 40 min: Chelsea aren't even trying any more, so much are they in control of this. Kalou flings a cross in from the right towards Joe Cole, who flicks a soft header over the bar. Any power on / effort with that and it was surely 3-0. Where's Naylor? with Philip Hucknall \"I was wondering why Gary Naylor hadn't emailed in so far tonight, and then I read this: Gary Gygax, co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons, dies. So I realised he is probably grieving too heavily even to check the MBMs right now. Deepest sympathies all round, I think.\" Half time: Chelsea 2-0 Olympiakos. The Greek fans are making a lot of noise here. Shame their team has been so quiet. The half peters out as Chelsea stroke the ball hither and yon. This isn't a match. Olympiakos have been pathetic, though Chelsea have been very impressive. And it's OK: former role-playing gamer Gary Naylor isn't crying into his Tizer at the sad news of Gygax's passing; he's too busy taking a pop at Frank Lampard: \"Given the vote tonight just down the river at Westminster and Frank Lampard's unabashed support for David Cameron's Tories, shouldn't Fat Frank be doing all he can to keep Chelsea out of Europe? After all, he played a big part in keeping England out.\" And we're off again! This \"match\" is up and running again. Surely Olympiakos can't be as bad again? Yes. Yes they can: within a minute Lampard is allowed to get a shot in on goal; his effort is blocked by Julio Cesar and deflected for a corner. From which... 47 min: GOAL! Chelsea 3 - 0 Complete Shower. ...the ball's swung in from the left, bouncing slowly past three traffic cones to the feet of Kalou, two yards out, who can't fail to bundle home. Olympiakos are a complete shower. 50 min: Kalou juggles the ball awhile in the centre circle. Nobody \"representing\" the Greek club bothers to make a challenge for about ten seconds. This is a pitiful display from Olympiakos. \"Mr Hucknall must not think me heartless in failing to acknowledge the passing of Gary Gygax,\" writes Gary Naylor. \"I paid what I hoped was a touching tribute on last night's cricket OBO. I'm afraid my fellow OBOers failed to be moved: one Dominic O'Reilly enquiring whether he was killed by a goblin.\" 52 min: Kalou rolls the ball to the feet of Lampard in the box. He's just to the right of goal with only Nikopolidis to beat, but drags a terrible shot wide. But does it matter? Of course it doesn't. First change for the Shower: Ledesma comes off, Belluschi jogs on. 55 min: Real Madrid are being held 0-0 by Roma at the Bernabeu, so they're still 2-1 down on aggregate. Meanwhile at the non-event, nothing much is going on. 57 min: Leonardo has come on for Olympic Shower. I have no idea who he's replaced, because I was looking at the Real Madrid v Roma game. That's wrong, isn't it. I'm sorry. But can you blame me? Can you really? 60 min: Leonardo is barged over by Makelele just outside the area. Belluschi's free kick is on target, but only travelling at 1cm/hr, and Cudicini snaffles with ease. I could give the Greeks some credit for finally getting a shot on target, which in the context of what's gone before is a huge improvement, but I'm not going to. \"Speaking of goblins, how is John Terry playing?\" asks Thomas Krantz, quipping furiously. \"I have him in my fantasy squad and would hate to think I've made a bad choice.\" He's doing alright. He's had nothing to do, to be honest, so bad have Olympic Shower been. He's been frowning and shouting a lot, though, so a typical performance in that respect. 63 min: A caption has just flashed up telling us that Ballack has covered 8800 metres, Lampard 8556 and Kalou 8502. What the hell is that supposed to mean or prove? 64 min: A beautiful first-time reverse pass by Lampard sends Drogba clear. He slots calmly into the right-hand corner, but he's offside. No goal. Does it matter? Of course it doesn't. 67 min: From a dreadful Olympic Shower corner, Joe Cole is sent clear on goal up the other end. His strike is well saved by Nikopolidis, who then smothers well from Makelele, who drops a shoulder on the edge of the area and has a dig. This is embarrassing to watch. 69 min: Lampard is booked for diving in the area as he chases after a Kalou cross with Patsatzoglou. Malouda on, Kalou off, this over. 72 min: Lampard is still arguing with the referee over his booking. 74 min: Drogba tries to whip home a free kick from 35 yards out on the left. That was never on; even this lot aren't that useless. That was a bold and saucy wrong. 75 min: Sisic comes on for... er... once again, I'm not sure. Be calm in the knowledge that it doesn't make a jot of difference. Lampard meanwhile is replaced by Essien. What's going on in Madrid? Hold on, let me have a look. 76 min: Why didn't I turn over and watch the second half of this match? I knew it, I just knew it. Roma went one up with about quarter of an hour to play through Taddei, but Raul has hit back immediately to keep Real in the hunt. They've got 12 minutes to score and take this tie into extra time. 78 min: Back at the non-event, Joe Cole goes off to be replaced by Shaun Wright-Phillips. Ferreira is booked for a cynical shoulder charge on Stoltidis. 81 min: OLYMPIC SHOWER DO SOMETHING!!! Belluschi sends in a purler from 30 yards which swerves through the air and twangs the crossbar. A brilliant attempt. Matthew Cobb has worked out what all the metre measuring means: \"8800 metres in 63 minutes = 9kph, or around 5.2mph. Walking speed = 4mph. So if you or me or Gary Naylor had just been wandering around the pitch for that time, we'd have covered around 7,000 metres in the same time. They want to impress us, but in fact it just proves what we know - footballers spend lots of time hanging around, then suddenly run after a little ball.\" 83 min: Terry is booked for a lunge on Belluschi. Stoltidis whacks in a free kick which Cudicini can only parry in the direction of Antzas; his close range header is pawed away magnificently by the keeper. That's more like it from the visitors; why couldn't they manage this from the start? 86 min: Balls to the Chelsea game, it's over, and has been for the last 82 minutes. Real, who are also down to ten men after the dismissal of Pepe, were so nearly put out of the competition there, as Di Rossi failed to poke in a ball rolling across an empty goal; think Gazza against Germany in the semi-final of Euro 96. Real are out anyway as it stands, with two minutes plus stoppage time to go, but that really would have been it. 90 min: There is going to be four extra minutes at the Bernabeu. A clumsy Guti challenge eats up the first minute, allowing much Roman rolling around. 90 min +2: REAL ARE OUT!!! Real Madrid 1 - 2 Roma. Mirko Vucinic heads a right-wing free kick home from six yards after Cannavaro fails to connect with a simple clearing header. That was terrible defending. Raul and Guti look heartbroken. Full time: Real Madrid 1 - 2 Roma. Boos ring around the Bernabeu as the referee blows his whistle and sends the home side out. From the little I saw of that game - about ten minutes in total during the second half - it was a very impressive performance from Roma and a pretty poor one from Real. The defending for Roma's winner has to be seen to be believed, though. Chelsea won 3-0, by the way, in a terrible one-sided borefest Rob Smyth is banging on about here.
