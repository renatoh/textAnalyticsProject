L\u00fcbcke, a district president in the central German state of Hesse for Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), was found with a gunshot wound to his head on the terrace of his home in Istha, near Kassel, on 2 June. On Saturday, a man was placed under \u201cprovisional arrest\u201d after police analysed data on L\u00fcbcke\u2019s mobile phone, but he was released in the early hours of Sunday. \u201cThe questioning did not yield any evidence pointing to complicity in the crime,\u201d police said. Investigators denied claims, originally made by the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, that the person detained was a young man who had a \u201cprivate relationship\u201d with L\u00fcbcke. Police have appealed for anyone who attended Istha\u2019s beer festival, which was held near L\u00fcbcke\u2019s home, to make contact. On the night of the killing, the 65-year-old politician and his wife had been babysitting their one-year-old grandchild, as the toddler\u2019s father was attending the fair on a nearby meadow. L\u00fcbcke had reportedly stayed out on the terrace to smoke after the rest of the family had gone to bed. When his son returned from the fair at about 12.30am, he discovered his father dead on the terrace. L\u00fcbcke, who represented the CDU in the area for more than 30 years, has been described in local news reports as a broadly popular figure with a common touch. In 2015, he caused the anger among the far right when he defended Merkel\u2019s decision not to close German borders at the height of the refugee crisis. At a public meeting in October 2015 that was attended by members of the local branch of the anti-Islam movement Pegida, L\u00fcbcke drew jeers when he said: \u201cYou have to stand up for your values. If you don\u2019t share those values then anyone is free to leave this country if they don\u2019t agree.\u201d He received death threats following his comments, and his private address was published on the far-right blog PI News. Footage of his remarkswas reshared by rightwing bloggers in February this year. Far-right accounts on social media celebrated L\u00fcbcke\u2019s death in the days after the news emerged, drawing condemnation from across the political spectrum. \u201cIf someone is so hated, just because he had liberal views, that is the decline of human morality,\u201d Germany\u2019s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, told the newspaper Tagesspiegel. Detectives on the case say they have found no evidence of a political dimension to the killing. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2019 to clarify that the man was arrested after police analysed data on L\u00fcbcke\u2019s mobile phone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
