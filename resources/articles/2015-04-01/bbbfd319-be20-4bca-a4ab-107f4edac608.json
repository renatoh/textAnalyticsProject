Lots of drama in an incredibly open game, which Marseille appeared in control of at half-time thanks to two Gignac goals. But PSG hit back with two of their own in two second-half minutes and the home players, and crowd, never really recovered. Advantage PSG in the title race. Thanks for your emails. Bye! Erm. Not quite sure what\u2019s happened here... but it looks like Gignac came back onto the field after the final whistle to remonstrate with the referee, and reading between the lines I would guess he used some choice language which was not received well. A terrible end to what could have been a brilliant night for the France forward. 90+5 mins: There was one more chance and it fell to PSG, but they slowed things down and went towards the corner which worked a treat as Marseille fouled Lavezzi by the touchline. PSG take a major step towards defending their Ligue 1 title with a thrilling contest at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome. It won\u2019t be any consolation for Marseille but Le Classique was a fantastic advert for French football. 90+3 mins: Marseille are throwing everything forward and a ball into the box falls kindly for Ocampus... but he bends the ball high and wide as the crowd hold their breath. There might be one more chance, you feel. 90 mins: The camera pans to the sideline where Gignac stands, arms folded, looking a bit fed up. I wonder if he\u2019s one of those strikers who secretly prefers to score two and lose than have a stinker and win? Probably not, given the stakes. Five minutes to be added on. 88 mins: That was Blaise Matuidi at his best, powering forwards and winning a free-kick high up the pitch to take another minute off the clock. 87 mins: Marseille have a free-kick on an angle from the right. Payet \u2013 Ligue 1\u2019s top assister (is that the word?) \u2013 curls an inswinger towards goal but it\u2019s headed away and PSG break, until Matuidi is closed down by a pack of recovering defenders in white. 84 mins: The fans have been brilliant in the Stade V\u00e9lodrome but they are raining down a variety of missiles and preventing Lavezzi from taking the corner. Eventually they relent and the corner is easily cleared away. Not long for Marseille to find something here, they still seem a little shell-shocked from that thunderous start to the second period by PSG. 83 mins: This match is becoming more and more bizarre. Marseille just give up on defending bar two or three who battle on and try to plug the leak as PSG break. They work the ball to Zlatan who elects to shoot from a very tight angle when a pass would have done once more. A moment later the Swede is sent through again amidst more bad defending and Mandanda has to parry the shot over. Corner. 80 mins: Really wasteful from Anderson lookalike Payet, shooting from range with his weaker left foot when a pass would have done. Pastore finally comes off, replaced by Adrien Rabiot who is a central midfielder. Perhaps a reshuffle for PSG, then. 79 mins: Batshuayi gets on the ball... I\u2019ve given him the big buildup... and he repays me by bending a lovely curling ball off the pitch for a throw. \u201cCavani -Dracula as my girlfriend calls him- is not happy to be replaced?\u201d emails Lucas Amvielle. \u201cDoes he realise he\u2019s been invisible tonight?\u201d He hasn\u2019t done much at all but I would say Pastore has done lots of bad things, which must be worse. 76 mins: Still such an open game, and every now and then we are treated to a flurry of chaos in the box which resembles two Sunday league sides scrapping to stay in the cup. The latest ends in a speculative Marseille shot which flies wide. 73 mins: Alessandrini is also on, replacing Ayew for Marseille. 71 mins: Michy Batshuayi comes on for Gignac who has been tiring perhaps. The Belgian has been in brilliant form with six goals in his last five games. 69 mins: The game has just settled down a little after PSG\u2019s double hit at the start of the second half. There\u2019s still a very open feel though and the sense that more goals are to come \u2013 it\u2019s one of those matches where there don\u2019t seem to be any midfielders, at all. 65 mins: That should have been game over but Pastore\u2019s finishing is wayward again. He was set through by a delicious Verratti pass, and cut from left to right but skewed his shot well wide. 62 mins: It is a pleasure to watch Verratti play sometimes... Today hasn\u2019t really been one of those days but he makes a nice run through the middle nonetheless and passes to Zlatan, whose chip through towards Lavezzi is overhit. 59 mins: Cavani trudges off and is livid to be replaced by Lavezzi, which he let\u2019s Laurent Blanc know. Blanc totally ignores him. 57 mins: Gignac almost snuck through there but Thiago Silva made an excellent tackle just outside the box. Moments later the French striker has another chance, but spins and fires his volley over the bar. 54 mins: Marseille fans behind the goal call for a penalty for a handball which stopped Gignac\u2019s shot, but in fairness to Marquinhos it came at him from close range and nothing is given. Wow. An incredible start to the second half! This time Pastore is slipped in behind Dja Djedje down the left and his cross falls into Ibrahimovic\u2019s path who appears to bundle the ball into the net, although the replay shows it comes off Jeremy Morel. Ibrahimovic slips as he makes contact and it\u2019s a poor free-kick but the ball falls perfectly for Marquinhos in the six-yard box to poke the ball high into the net. 48 mins: Free-kick. Zlatan. I would not want to be in this wall... 47 mins: Payet, standing on the same patch of grass where Matuidi bent in PSG\u2019s equaliser, tries to repeat the trick but gets a little too much on his shot and it sails high and wide. Payet looks a little like Manchester United flop Anderson, I think. 46 mins: We are back underway and had it not been for Dja Djedje clattering into Ibrahimovic (legally) in the penalty area it would be 2-2 right now. Fast start. The second half is imminent and the PSG players are out on the pitch, on their own right now. Not sure where Marseille are. While we wait, here\u2019s the best goal ever in this fixture. IT. IS. RIDICULOUS. \u201cHello Lawrence,\u201d emails my saviour Kari Tulinius again with some more on the first goal, almost as though if I didn\u2019t give enough detail. \u201cMarseille has scored. Payet sends a cross in from the right that gets a deflection. Gignac gets to the end of it and powers home a header. Oh, and shortly after that David Luiz pulls up with hamstring problems. Van der Wiel comes on instead. I hope the technical troubles are fixed.\u201d They are fixed and I am sane again, thanks Kari. If you have seven minutes to kill on this Easter Sunday, perhaps slumped on the sofa after a roast or an excess of chocolate, sit back and enjoy the genius of Ronaldinho in this fixture in days gone by. In my mind Ronaldinho is the most enjoyable player to watch in the modern era (I came up with that opinion today to generate some emails). *Warning: at about 4:10 Jerome Leroy ruins a moment of Ronaldinho artistry which if you\u2019re anything like me will make you want to reach into the screen and crush him into mulch, the idiot. Thinking about it Leroy might have been the inspiration for Nani to do this\u2026 Gignac\u2019s finishing was the difference in that first half. Pastore had a near-identical chance to that of Gignac\u2019s second goal at the start of the match but the Argentinian has not been scoring many of late and slashed wide. Gignac, on the other hand, has hauled himself above Ibrahimovic to second in the Ligue 1 goalscoring charts. Peep! And that\u2019s the break. Thrilling half of football, both teams blowing the trumpet for Ligue 1\u2019s entertainment value. 45+1 mins: Payet whips in a dangerous cross onto Gignac\u2019s forehead who spears a header at goal, and Sirigu pushes the ball over. Gignac spins away and gees up the crowd, as if they needed it. It\u2019s bedlam in the Stade V\u00e9lodrome. The home side are back in front and it\u2019s that man again. PSG give the ball away in midfield and with one forward pass Gignac is through on goal. He keeps his composure to finish across Sirigu into the corner, his 18th of the campaign ... Gignac is out of contract at the end of the season. 39 mins: The free-kick is lashed wildly over and everyone can take a breather, which I desperately need due technology-related stress. 37 mins: That goal has momentarily silenced a raucous home crowd, but they are up on their feet again as Payet and Thauvin line up a free-kick around 25 yards out... Game on! Matuidi is given the ball in a little space on the edge of the box, shuffles it onto his right foot and bends a beauty around Mandanda and into the far corner. Gignac heads home from Payet\u2019s cross (is what we\u2019ve been told). But we\u2019ve got visual now for good, so that\u2019s good. More technical issues at Guardian Towers, back with you in a minute after I\u2019ve torn my hair out... 22 mins: Fanni chops down Ibrahimovic with more than a hint of intent. Zlatan makes the most of it and the yellow card is out again. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t see it,\u201d Kari Tulinius emails, \u201cthe game started with a false start. Gignac, I think, ran into the opposition half before PSG had kicked off. Marseille, to say the least, are pumped up for this game. Enjoy the game!\u201d I didn\u2019t see that; this MBM now feels complete. 18 mins: The champions have a corner of their own and after Mandanda\u2019s initial punch comes chaos, with several players including Ibrahimovic failing to get control of the ball in the area. A moment later Cavani is put through on goal at a tight angle, but the out-of-form forward can\u2019t make any meaningful contact with his attempted volley. 16 mins: The corner is cleared invitingly to Lemina on the edge of the box who skies it a full goal higher than the goal. Terrible effort but the game is bubbling up nicely. 15 mins: Dimitri Payet is standing over a free-kick in a very promising position to the left of the box... but he finds only the wall and slashes the rebound away for a throw. Marseille win it back quickly enough though, and have a corner. 11 mins: Whisker! Marseille have a criminally high line and a simple ball forwards puts Pastore in on goal, but the Argetinian forward slashes his shot across Mandanda and a whisker wide of the right-post. 10 mins: Payet is trying to pull the strings in midfield and spreads the ball first right and then left, majestically off the pitch for a PSG goal-kick. 9 mins: Early yellow card for Romao, which looked a little harsh \u2013 the Marseille midfielder got a good chunk of ball with his studs. 7 mins: The atmosphere is typically fraught and the players are having to ignore fans throwing all sorts on to the pitch. Cavani and Ibrahimovic both go up for a long ball but both miss and it rolls through to the Marseille captain, Steve Mandanda. 4 mins: Hooray! We have visual. That was a nightmare. No goals yet. Peep! The game has kicked off... but our tv feed hasn\u2019t... back in a moment So Bielsa, who named his team during the week, leaves the very in-form Belgian striker Michy Batshuayi on the bench, but expect to see him later especially if Gignac doesn\u2019t get going. Gianelli Imbula is suspended so Mario Lamina comes in in midfield. Laurent Blanc picks the team we expected with Lavezzi only making the bench, sitting alongside Cabaye who has not been fully fit. And here\u2019s our substitutes... Hello team and welcome to Le Classique, a fixture which has not carried such significance since the Qatari billions added a little extra edge to the rivalry. French football\u2019s showpiece could have a major impact on the the destination of the Ligue 1 title in an evermore enthralling season in which Lyon and Monaco are also well-placed at the sharp end of the table. The arrival of PSG\u2019s wealthy backers has only underlined the old stereotype of the haughty bourgeois Parisians, and one man carries himself with an ideal level of arrogance to play the villain of the piece. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is the centre of attention again, and with 17 goals in 21 league games this season he leads the line for Laurent Blanc\u2019s expensively assembled team. Their hosts on the other hand play the working-class heroes, without the riches but with plenty of resolve and the tireless work ethic of a typical Mario Bielsa side. They too have a leading man to fit the story; Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac is proud of his Gypsy roots and the type of hussle and bussle striker whose 16 league goals have taken a little longer to acquire, and with a little less grace, but with all the grit and determination of the anti-Zlatan. Who will prevail at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome tonight? Kick-off: 8pm BST"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
