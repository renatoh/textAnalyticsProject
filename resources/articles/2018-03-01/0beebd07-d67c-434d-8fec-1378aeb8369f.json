The Chelsea academy graduate, who had impressed for Gareth Southgate\u2019s senior side in November\u2019s friendlies, is on loan at Crystal Palace but has not featured since limping out of a defeat by Arsenal in late December. The 22-year-old has undertaken his rehabilitation back at his parent club and, with the Premier League champions opting against operating on the ankle, finally responded positively to non-invasive treatment after two months out. Loftus-Cheek trained fully with Chelsea\u2019s under-23s at Cobham on Monday and, with a couple of follow-up sessions pencilled in, was due to return to Palace on Saturday with a view to working with the first team next week. However, he suffered knee pain immediately after that first run-out and, although the injury is considered to be a knock-on from his lengthy period out, his comeback has been delayed again. \u201cThe news had been very positive because the session, in which the ankle was being tested, had gone very well,\u201d said the Palace manager, Roy Hodgson. \u201cBut he managed to pick up another very minor injury which now, of course, has to be treated before we get him back here. The good news is that the injury which kept him out for a long period of time \u2013 the ankle \u2013 seems to be much better. He is on the mend from that. But they now have to look at the minor injury [to the knee]. We are hopeful we see him back at Selhurst Park very soon.\u201d Palace are hopeful they may have Loftus-Cheek available for the visit of Liverpool on 31 March but that would be dependent upon him not suffering any further setbacks. Martin Kelly and Jeffrey Schlupp have recovered from hamstring and knee ligament injuries respectively to train with Hodgson\u2019s squad this week. Yet Palace, who have signed the former Liverpool goalkeeper Diego Cavalieri until the end of the season, will still have 11 first-team players unavailable against Manchester United on Monday, including Mamadou Sakho who is suffering pain from scar tissue in a calf. \u201cHis is not a mental problem,\u201d said Hodgson of the France defender, who has featured only once since 9 December. \u201cIt\u2019s a genuine injury, with the scar tissue related to an earlier injury.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
