As she walks, she tugs suggestively on the zipper in a pretend striptease, kicking up her leg and singing to the tune of Right Said Fred: \u201cI\u2019m too sexy for my bin\u201d. This is the sort of content you can find in Bin isolation outing, an Australian Facebook group that\u2019s amassed almost half a million members in under two weeks. Its premise is that with social distancing measures in full force, the country\u2019s wheelie bins spend more time outside than we do \u2013 so why not dress up for those weekly walks to the curb? Members of the group, which has found fans around the globe, have been busy sharing their bin day outfits for all to enjoy. The submissions range from the heartwarming to the downright ridiculous: some have used it as an excuse to put on some lippy and their wedding dress from 1974, others have gone to work on dramatic, garbage-themed Game of Thrones re-enactments (hashtag: #BinterIsComing). The more creative a poster can get, the bigger the response. Helen Smart, star of the striptease video, says she spontaneously decided to film her video \u201cfor fun\u201d after being added to the group by a relative. \u201cI got up this morning and looked in the cupboard at the old dressing gowns hanging there. I just put it on, added a scarf around my neck, took me [false] teeth out and came out to my husband in the living room and said, \u2018I\u2019m too sexy!\u2019 He looked at me and couldn\u2019t stop laughing. And I said, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s do the garbage bin now!\u2019 \u201cMy son just rang me up and said, \u2018Oh my God, Mum, I can\u2019t believe you got your teeth out.\u2019 I went, \u2018Yeah, \u2019cause I\u2019m sexy!\u2019 Just because I\u2019m 74, nearly 75, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m dead.\u201d Helen has been isolating at home with her husband in Newcastle. She\u2019s only left the house twice in the past month, both times to go to the doctor. \u201cI said to my husband: we\u2019ve got to cheer ourselves up. And then that [Facebook group] came up and I haven\u2019t laughed so much in all my life.\u201d There\u2019s a quintessentially Australian energy to the way people in the group aren\u2019t afraid to take the piss out of themselves. Tattooed tradesmen have wheeled the bins out in budgie smugglers and high heels. A mother and daughter filmed a scene dressed as Kath and Kim from the eponymous TV show. One lady simply posed between her blue and green bins in an inflatable penis costume. Kim Ross, of Bendigo, \u201cgot so many laughs\u201d from the group that she and her partner decided to film their own contribution: the two of them waddling down the driveway in matching dinosaur costumes, ready to greet the garbage men at sunrise. Karen Aitchison, of Burpengary in Queensland, has raked in 14,000 likes in a few hours for her post: a photo of her husband standing on top of a campervan in a flowing pink frock, in tribute to the classic movie Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. She says the shot took about half an hour to set up this morning. \u201cWe had to wait for the bin to be emptied so we could hoist it up with a rope,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I had to wait for another neighbour to go inside so we weren\u2019t seen in the process.\u201d Karen has been isolating with her husband and their son. \u201cWe were joking amongst ourselves as a family the other week, \u2018We better wash our hair, it\u2019s bin night tonight.\u2019 Then I came across the group and I thought, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s priceless.\u2019\u201d In the midst of a global crisis, she says, the Facebook group has become a source of much-needed comic relief \u2013 and a show of solidarity among the isolated. \u201cI mean it just levels it, doesn\u2019t it? We\u2019re all the same, and we\u2019ve all gotta have a bit of fun somehow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
