United are at Everton on Saturday and Rooney is available again after the ankle knock that ruled him out of England\u2019s Euro 2016 qualifiers during the international break. Rooney has not scored at Goodison Park since April 2007, has only one goal in the Premier League this season, and has not registered away in the competition for 11 months. Asked about the 29-year-old\u2019s barren run away in the league, Van Gaal said: \u201cSo maybe against Everton he can change but his average is not so good [against them]. So it\u2019s getting time that he changed that pattern. I don\u2019t know [why]. That you have to ask Wayne but I\u2019m a manager who analyses opponents and gives him advice as to how we can disorganise Everton\u2019s defence and then maybe he can score. \u201cThat is what I\u2019m doing, not only for Wayne but all the players, especially from the view of the team tactics rather than the individual tactics.\u201d Rooney has also failed to create a single goal for the side in the league this term. Yet Van Gaal refused to state the striker is out of form. \u201cYou cannot answer that because he\u2019s part of the team,\u201d the Dutchman said. \u201cHe\u2019s scored for us in the Champions League. So for me it is not so important who is scoring. We have scored a lot of goals. In the beginning your criticism was we don\u2019t score goals but now we\u2019ve scored a lot of goals and you\u2019re picking up an individual player and I don\u2019t like that.\u201d Van Gaal maintains that Rooney is still his most vital player. \u201cHe\u2019s our captain so that\u2019s very important because his influence is bigger than every other player in our group. He\u2019s a very important player for me, his colleagues, everybody,\u201d said the 63-year-old, who does not believe Rooney is burdened by being the captain. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it with his personality.\u201d Van Gaal believes the side are making enough opportunities for the Liverpudlian to score. \u201cHave we created enough chances?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes, I think so. I think we have chances to score in every game. Also against Arsenal, after the first 20 minutes we have created a lot of chances. And also after [going behind] 3-0. So I think the spirit in the team is very good. It\u2019s not a given in every team that you can create a lot of chances at 3-0 down and we did it, so that\u2019s the positive thing. But of course it\u2019s very important that out of your chances you score and against Arsenal we didn\u2019t.\u201d Anthony Martial was voted the Premier League player of the month for September after an impressive start to his United career. The 19-year-old is playing at centre-forward where Van Gaal had planned for Rooney to play this season. Asked why the manager had changed this strategy Van Gaal said: \u201cHe\u2019s second striker. Our 10 is a second striker. That\u2019s what my preference is but sometimes I need another type in midfield. We\u2019ll have to see if he continues with that because Wayne can play in different positions.\u201d Bastian Schweinsteiger is available again after a minor thigh problem. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing as with Rooney. I was happy that my colleagues [England and Germany coaches] didn\u2019t take risks with them because Bastian could maybe have played the second match but he didn\u2019t take that risk so that\u2019s good for me,\u201d said Van Gaal. Everton may be the subject of a buyout from a group associated with the Major League Soccer franchise Sporting Kansas City, according to reports."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
