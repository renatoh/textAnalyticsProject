Chelsea are enduring a torrid run in what will prove to have been a transitional season and, while the club hierarchy had been staunch in their support of their manager of eight months, a sequence of four wins in 14 games is sorely testing their faith in the current regime. Villas-Boas's side will hope to return to the Champions League qualification places on Saturday afternoon, for 24 hours at least, by beating Bolton Wanderers, though a sense of realism appears to have set in with the Portuguese. Where, up until recently, Villas-Boas had been insistent that a club of this size was obliged to challenge for honours every season, the 34-year-old has now pointed to the toils of rivals such as Milan \u2013 who did not claim major silverware between the 2007 European Cup and Serie A title in 2011 \u2013 as evidence that transition can be painful. \"A lot of clubs have gone through it in the past,\" Villas-Boas said. \"Milan went four years without a title going through a major cycle of change. Our battle is the results, the negative results. Things can further go down still, because of how tight it is in the league, and I need to prepare people for that. \"One win will give us belief, but time is needed. [The pressure] reflects a society always in a hurry for everything: the fans are in a hurry for results, I am in a hurry for us to overcome Napoli in the Champions League. That sense of urgency and emergency does not respect time. It's part of a frenetic society. What would a managerial change do in this situation? \"Look what happened at Internazionale. They ended up deconstructing a winning team that had claimed three titles in a season with Jos\u00e9 [Mourinho]. Obviously, there's a psychological impact with results, but it can create further problems if you do not build something new.\" Rafael Ben\u00edtez, the manager who succeeded Mourinho at Internazionale, is in contention to replace Villas-Boas should the owner's patience snap; an immediate improvement in results is required to maintain the Portuguese's tenure. To do that, the manager must rely on experienced players who have been alienated at times by the reality that their spells at the club are steadily drawing to a close. Asked whether, when trying to change the culture of a club, he had anticipated resistance, Villas-Boas said: \"That is normal. I think you expect resistance and disappointment, but there must always be a sense of responsibility to the employer. The players have to perform. Either they do that or they become part of the change. The players have been excellent in accepting this is a job that needs to be done. Understanding is needed, and it takes time because of the foundations laid down at this club. That is not an excuse. You have the best players around and we should be doing much better. \"Maybe, in the past, there has not been patience at the club [when it comes to the manager]. The problem is that results lead you into doubt. Are you able to live with that climate of doubt and believe in the person and the project, or do you believe the person is not the right one? Continuity is necessary. What is very clear in my message is that I have belief in the players I've got to take this challenge through, even if there is an obvious need for a win to come.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
