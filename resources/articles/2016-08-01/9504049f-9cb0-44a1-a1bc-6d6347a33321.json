Most worry about their student debts, many believe their degree was not worth the money and their confidence that a degree has improved their chances of getting a good job is diminishing, according to the survey published on Wednesday. The NUS report, Double Jeopardy, concludes that those who graduated in 2015 have entered the world of work with significant debt, having paid far more for their education while receiving far less of a benefit from that education in the labour market than previous generations. Six months after leaving university, 47% of the 2015 graduate cohort were living back at home with their parents or guardian to save money; seven out of 10 said they were concerned about their student debt, and half thought their degree was not worth the fees they had paid. Quite apart from their student loan debts, six out of 10 still had outstanding consumer debt left over from their degree, averaging at \u00a32,600, and 46% had accumulated further debt since leaving university. Yet only 6% said they would not have gone into higher education at all if they could turn the clock back. They valued the knowledge and skills their degree had given them and the ability to critically analyse the world. On employment, 52% were in full-time work, with 13% working part-time and 2% self-employed. Just more than 8% said they were unemployed, while 17% were studying for a post-graduate qualification. Of those in work, six out of 10 were employed on permanent contracts; a quarter were employed on fixed-term contracts and 6% were on causal or zero-hours contracts. The report was based on an online survey of more than 500 graduates who had been full-time students from a range of different institutions, and is a follow-up to a similar survey last summer of the same respondents, looking at the cost of study and its impact on graduate decision making. Sorana Vieru, NUS vice president for higher education, said: \u201cThis research shows many graduates are without work, badly paid or in precarious and casualised employment, especially women. \u201cThe majority are in debt, not just with student loan repayments, but they also owe money to banks, credit card companies and loan sharks. \u201cThe graduates face a double jeopardy: they enter the world of work having paid far more for their education, with the debts hanging over them. Yet they receive far less benefit from this education in the labour market compared to previous generations, while living costs keep rising and the welfare safety net is shrinking.\u201d The study also flagged up income inequality between men and women, showing three times as many men in full-time work than women were earning over \u00a330,000, while double the number of women than men were earning less than \u00a315,000. The lowest levels of employment meanwhile were among those who studied creative arts, where 42% were employed full-time and average earnings were lowest. A Department for Education spokesperson said graduates still enjoyed higher employment rates and an average \u00a39,500 annual earnings premium compared to non-graduates. \u201cAs the OECD has recognised, our student funding system is sustainable, supporting our world-class universities while ensuring graduates only pay back when they are earning above \u00a321,000. \u201cWe know there is still more to be done to address variability in graduate earnings \u2013 which is exactly why we are reforming the system through measures such as our Teaching Excellence Framework, which will incentivise all universities to raise the quality of their teaching and focus on improving graduate outcomes.\u201d The NUS survey was published the day after Labour detailed its plans to reinstate both student maintenance grants \u2013 abolished by the government earlier this month \u2013 and the education maintenance allowance for 16-18-year-olds from low-income families which was scrapped in 2011. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \u201cToday\u2019s commitment to restoring both EMA and student maintenance grants shows that while the Tories continue to burden our young people with debt they will never repay, the Labour party is committed to investing in our young people. Meanwhile an online poll by HSBC of 1,000 UK students suggested that the average student spends \u00a33,304 on their first 100 days of university, while 19% spend their entire student loan within the first 100 days. More than half (56%) said living away from home was more expensive than expected and 35% admitted they found managing their finances overwhelming. A sizeable 42% received financial help from parents and family; 16% have a job and another 16% use their overdraft. The survey also found that students spent almost twice as much on alcohol and nights out (\u00a3626) than on course materials (\u00a3328) in the first 100 days, but rent and food are the biggest cost (\u00a31,279 and \u00a3670 respectively)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
