Having been admitted to hospital a few days ago in Cesena, a city in Emilia-Romagna, one of the regions hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, it is being reported that he may have died from the disease. Announcing news of the designer\u2019s death on Friday morning, the brand\u2019s chief executive, Riccardo Sciutto, told the fashion website Women\u2019s Wear Daily: \u201cHe was a master, it was a great pleasure to have met him. He was our spiritual guide and he is today more than ever.\u201d His shoes were used by designers such as Azzedine Ala\u00efa, Versace, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana in their collections, and worn by celebrities from Lupita Nyong\u2019o to Rihanna, and Paris Hilton to Laura Dern. Ariana Grande has often offset her signature short, baggy hoodies and high ponytail looks with a pair of the late designer\u2019s Matrix thigh-high boots. Having learnt the craft of shoemaking from his father, Rossi began selling his designs in shops in Bologna in 1966, before launching his eponymous brand in 1968. Among the cordwainer\u2019s most famous shoe designs was the extravagantly strappy, round-soled Opanca sandal and the more classic, sharp-toed and high-heeled Godiva pump. In 1999, the Sergio Rossi brand was sold to the Gucci Group, now know as Kering, one of the world\u2019s biggest luxury fashion conglomerates, before being sold by Kering to European investment house Investindustrial in 2015. Sciutto said the designer \u201cloved women and was able to capture a woman\u2019s femininity in a unique way. He was never over-the-top, always in good taste. The shoes were always wearable and he was never satisfied until they were perfect. They were not accessories for him. He told me once that he wanted to create the perfect extension of a woman\u2019s leg.\u201d Last month Rossi donated \u20ac100,000 to the Sacco hospital in Milan to help in the fight against coronavirus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
