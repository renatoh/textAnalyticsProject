But there have been times, in these intensely difficult weeks, with our social lives narrowed down to the dimensions of our computer and mobile screens, when it has felt like nature has been taunting us with the gorgeousness of this year\u2019s spring. It\u2019s there just outside the window: the air is thick with it. But we can\u2019t get out and enjoy it. Even under the influence of intense cabin fever, I\u2019m not quite daft enough to think we can recreate the missing joys of spring with a glass of wine. But some wines do at least seem to offer a sense, however fleeting, of spring\u2019s scents and energy. The sauvignon blancs of France\u2019s Central Loire Valley certainly have this effect on me: that combination of sappy grassy greenness, with notes of blossomy white flowers, and an intense freshness and silvery liveliness all very much present in Domaine de la Rablais\u2019 example. Andr\u00e9 Dezat Sancerre Blanc 2018 (from \u00a316.95, tanners-wines.co.uk; bbr.com; uncorked.co.uk) Touraine sauvignon, drawn from a wide area of vineyards across the central Loire, is undoubtedly among the best value white wines around right now, with tonic-bringing, bright, zesty own-label expressions available from Aldi (\u00a35.79), Sainsbury\u2019s (\u00a37) and Waitrose (\u00a37.99) all hitting the Loire\u2019s spring source. For extra-levels of graceful, evocative charm, it\u2019s worth seeking out the individual villages, of which Sancerre is the most celebrated. You have to be careful with Sancerre: the vineyards that fan out from the town on its lofty perch are beautiful but the quality is not always as good as the elevated price tag suggests. Like chateauneuf-du-pape down in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, this is an appellation with rather too many producers trading on the famous name. At their best, however, the wines have a quintessential Loire sauvignon mix of verdant verve and delicate raciness, and the wines produced by Andr\u00e9 Dezat and sons are undoubtedly, consistently in that category. Ch\u00e2teau de Tracy Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 2018 (from \u00a321, mrwheelerwine.com; tanners-wines.co.uk; leaandsandeman.co.uk) Sancerre\u2019s rival for the greatest producer of Loire sauvignon blanc is Pouilly-Fum\u00e9. Beginner\u2019s in wine are often told that the way to distinguish Pouilly from Sancerre is to look for the distinctive whiff of gun flint \u2013 a smoky smell like someone\u2019s just let off a cap gun. I\u2019ve never been entirely convinced by this: from time to time I do pick up smoky notes in Pouilly-Fum\u00e9, but no more often than I do in other Loire (or indeed, global) sauvignon blancs. Mostly the big differences between the wines of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 seem to come down more to winemaking style and the precise patch of vineyard the producer is working with. I\u2019ve never reliably been able to tell them apart. What I do know, however, is that the sauvignon blanc of Ch\u00e2teau de Tracy is among my favourites in Pouilly-Fum\u00e9, the Loire, the world \u2026 a wine of evanescent, verdant, spirit-lifting charm.
