The picture should be clearer by the time that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and his squad fly to Milan on Tuesday afternoon, ahead of their Champions League last 16 first-leg tie against Milan at San Siro. But Wenger knows that he must plan without Mertesacker and he is ready to move Thomas Vermaelen into the middle from left-back, where he has filled in of late, and recall Kieran Gibbs, who is fit again after his groin problems. The left-back has not played since mid-October. Jack Wilshere will undergo a scan this week, which will reveal the severity of the set-back that he has suffered as he fights to recover from the stress fracture to his ankle that has ruined his season. Caution and caginess has come to underpin every step of the midfielder's rehabilitation but there is optimism at Arsenal that his season is far from over. The tie at Milan will be the final game of Thierry Henry's loan spell back at the club but Gervinho is expected to be available for Saturday's FA Cup fifth round tie at Sunderland, when Wenger will make changes to his starting line-up. The Ivory Coast winger is due back in London by Wednesday from the Africa Cup of Nations, where he experienced heartbreak in Sunday's final, missing the vital penalty in his country's shoot-out defeat to Zambia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
