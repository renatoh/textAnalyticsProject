Ashton was recalled after a three-game absence at Warrington last Sunday but switched to the wing midway through the first half after his errors led to three of the Wolves' first four tries. Huddersfield, who are aiming to go fourth in the Super League table and pull five points clear of ninth-placed Wigan, will be without their Australian hooker Brad Drew. He returned home earlier this week for family reasons. Leeds will give a debut to Mike Ratu, an 18-year-old centre, in tonight's other game against a SalfordCity Reds team three points adrift at the bottom and desperate for their first win at Headingley since 1977."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
