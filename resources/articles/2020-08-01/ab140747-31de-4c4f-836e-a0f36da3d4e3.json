They are back in this virtual adaptation for a topical social satire on Zoom that focuses on misogyny and male privilege as the original, award-winning stage production did, and adds references to \u201cthe chap George Floyd\u201d, the Black Lives Matter movement and its relationship to Irish identity. Directed by David Horan, the piece begins with familiar small-talk on the lockdown that seems designed to lull us before the bonhomie cracks apart: someone mentions baking bread, another speaks of a \u201cman stepping inside my two metres\u201d. One sighs: \u201cI fucking hate Zoom.\u201d They initially look like the modern, liberal face of Ireland, with new man Dara (Michael Ford-FitzGerald), speaking up for women and effusing about his tasty vegetarian lasagne, while Grace (Bethan Mary-James), a black Irish doctor, is hailed as a \u201cfrontline hero\u201d and Liz (Amy Conroy), a lesbian, brings forth a sculpture of a vagina from her mantelpiece to show the others. The tone snaps when they begin to discuss the graffiti, which appears to refer to Liz\u2019s girlfriend, and for which Liz wants proper ideological redress: \u201cIt\u2019s control, it\u2019s power, it\u2019s violence.\u201d Liz\u2019s main opponent is Paul (Luke Griffin), an out-of-work screenwriter and epitome of fragile white masculinity, arguing against the scourge of liberal politics and feminism. Two older characters, Steve Blount as Philip and Pom Boyd as Maggie, seem like his silent accomplices, averting their gaze from any mention of systemic sexism or racism and revealing bigotries even as they try to veil them. \u201cSince when is an Irishman white?\u201d says Maggie, using Ireland\u2019s historical oppression to argue her way out of charges of white-on-black racism in modern Ireland, until that view is challenged. The discussion becomes as emotive and angry as a Twitter pile-on with characters making tone-deaf statements and becoming ever more stubbornly entrenched in their positions. The six neighbours are excellently portrayed: each is given a degree of humanity, however unlikable they may be. Even so, they are too bound to stereotype, and the characterisation bears little nuance or subtlety. It all feels like sermonising by the end, with the force of the drama dropping away, but this is an impassioned social comedy with very contemporary concerns and some pin-sharp lines. This Beautiful Virtual Village is available online until 17 September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
