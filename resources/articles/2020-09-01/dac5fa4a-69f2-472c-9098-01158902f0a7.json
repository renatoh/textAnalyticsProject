The supreme court justice died on Friday at the age of 87, 27 years after her nomination by Bill Clinton. Donald Trump, former presidents, governors, federal jurists and lawmakers led tributes. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state would erect the statue. \u201cShe redefined gender equity and civil rights and ensured America lived up to her founding ideals,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cShe was a monumental figure of equality, and we can all agree that she deserves a monument in her honor.\u201d In Washington, hundreds gathered on the steps of the court overnight, marking the passing of a justice who became a hero to liberals. Elizabeth LaBerge, a lawyer, said Ginsburg\u2019s death was another blow for people who have made \u201cserious law and order a mission of their lives\u201d. \u201cWho is going to take care of us?\u2019 \u201d LaBerge, 36, told the Washington Post. \u201cIt just feels like such a deep loss at this particular time. It\u2019s a lot to put on a woman of her age to keep us safe and functioning as a constitutional democracy.\u201d The California senator Kamala Harris, Joe Biden\u2019s running mate in the presidential election, called Ginsburg a \u201ctitan\u201d, \u201ca relentless defender of justice\u201d and \u201ca legal mind for the ages\u201d. \u201cJustice Ginsburg,\u201d she said, \u201cwas known to pose the question, \u2018What is the difference between a bookkeeper in the Garment District and a supreme court justice?\u2019 Her answer: \u2018One generation.\u2019 She never forgot where she came from, or those who sacrificed to help her grow into the historic icon we all came to revere.\u201d On Saturday morning, Harris too visited the steps of the court. \u201cThe stakes of this election couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMillions of Americans are counting on us to win and protect the supreme court \u2013 for their health, for their families, and for their rights.\u201d Trump, who has a chance to tip the court firmly to the right, was at first caught off guard. After stepping off stage at a campaign rally in Minnesota on Friday night, he described Ginsburg as \u201can amazing woman who led an amazing life\u201d. The president later issued a formal proclamation that remembered Ginsburg \u201cfor her brilliant mind and her powerful dissents at the supreme court\u201d, and ordered flags flown at half-staff. On Saturday, Trump said he would move quickly to nominate a replacement, setting up a Senate fight just weeks before the election. Biden said: \u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law.\u201d He also posted: \u201cLet me be clear: the voters should pick a president, and that president should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg.\u201d Barack Obama, who nominated two women to follow Ginsburg on to the court, wrote: \u201cJustice Ginsburg helped us see that discrimination on the basis of sex isn\u2019t about an abstract ideal of equality; that it doesn\u2019t only harm women; that it has real consequences for all of us. It\u2019s about who we are \u2013 and who we can be.\u201d Bill Clinton said: \u201cAmerica has lost one of the most extraordinary justices ever to serve on the supreme court \u2026 her landmark opinions advancing gender equality, marriage equality, the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of immigrants, and so many more moved us closer to \u2018a more perfect union\u2019.\u201d Hillary Clinton said: \u201cJustice Ginsburg paved the way for so many women, including me. There will never be another like her. Thank you RBG.\u201d The eight remaining supreme court justices issued a joint statement. Chief justice John Roberts mourned \u201ca jurist of historic stature [and] a cherished colleague\u201d. Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan described Ginsburg as a \u201chero\u201d and mentor. Clarence Thomas called her \u201cthe essence of grace, civility and dignity\u201d, while Brett Kavanaugh said he learned from her \u201cprincipled voice and marveled at her wonderful wit\u201d. Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the judiciary committee who will play a key role in the nomination, said: \u201cWhile I had many differences with her on legal philosophy, I appreciate her service to our nation.\u201d Civil rights activist, Guardian columnist and NBA hall of famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar remembered Ginsburg as \u201cthe best of us\u201d and a champion of \u201cequal opportunity and fair justice\u201d. \u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg was one of the fiercest, most intelligent defenders of equal opportunity and fair justice for all,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said on Saturday in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cShe was the best of us and her example brought out the best in everyone who believes in a truly democratic America.\u201d Erin Murphy, a law professor at New York University, remarked on Ginsburg\u2019s friendship with the conservative justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016 and whose seat was held open by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, in defiance of political convention, until a new president could pick a replacement. \u201cWhat irony,\u201d Murphy wrote, \u201cthat the deaths of Scalia and Ginsburg \u2013 the two revered justices from opposite ends of the political spectrum, famously best buds notwithstanding ideological difference \u2013 precipitated our extreme free fall into rancor and partisanship.\u201d Recently receiving the National Constitution Center\u2019s Liberty Medal on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment which gave women the right to vote, Ginsburg said she felt lucky to have joined the fight. \u201cIt was my great good fortune to have the opportunity to participate in the long effort to place equal citizenship stature for women on the basic human rights agenda,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cIn that regard, I was scarcely an innovator.\u201d The justice will be buried at Arlington national cemetery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
