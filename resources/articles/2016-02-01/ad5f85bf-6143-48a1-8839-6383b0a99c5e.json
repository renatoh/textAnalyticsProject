For all that there is respect between the unbeaten super-bantamweights who bring their respective IBF and WBA world title belts to the ring at the MEN Arena, this unification bout has been so long in the making \u2013 almost as drawn out as that between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao \u2013 that the tension has built to the point where one of them might let emotion override common sense. Frampton, who turns 28 today and is just eight months older than Quigg, says it will not be him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have a problem with that,\u201d he says. The fight trade favours him ever so slightly, although Quigg\u2019s second-round stoppage last July of the Spaniard Kiko Mart\u00ednez, who took Frampton the distance the previous September, eradicated even a scintilla of complacency in the Irishman\u2019s camp. And he admits Quigg is better than any of his 21 previous opponents, an unexpectedly generous and candid assessment so close to battle, especially given some of their pre-fight exchanges. \u201cKiko Mart\u00ednez was probably my best [previous] opponent. He was on a good run, full of confidence, he\u2019d won a world title, defended it a few times. Chris Avalos was good, a mandatory. But I think Quigg is probably the best opponent so far.\u201d Was he impressed, then, with Quigg\u2019s quick despatch of Mart\u00ednez? \u201cHe got rid of him early, sure enough. I didn\u2019t expect that, I didn\u2019t think he was going to go over so quickly. He went over, got up and walked on to a shot.\u201d But that is history, recent though it is. Frampton is concerned now only with the job in hand. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted it for a long time. When I was looking for a British title four years ago, and he wouldn\u2019t allow me to fight for it, that was the first time I really wanted this fight. But looking back, it was probably for the best to let it brew. Both of us are world champions. It\u2019s a much bigger fight.\u201d Could it turn into an ugly scrap, rather than a boxing match between highly-skilled technicians? \u201cHe\u2019ll need to maybe think about that. I\u2019m not daft. I\u2019ve got a good boxing brain. I\u2019m not going to let the hate in the fight get to me. I\u2019m going to do what I have to do to win the fight, whatever it takes. I\u2019ll not let the blood rush to my head. I\u2019ll be cool and calm on the night, and get the job done.\u201d And, if he gets it done, will he be going back to Belfast to indulge in his favourite sweet, pavlova? \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m a wee bit sick of it. I\u2019ve had \u2019em after each fight. There\u2019s a lady who makes them for me, Margaret \u2013 I can\u2019t remember her surname, Margaret the pavlova lady, I\u2019ll call her. We\u2019ll see.\u201d This has the ingredients of a minor British classic, but, after a Frampton points win, Margaret is likely to be getting another visit on Sunday morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
