The demand for an outside body to examine allegations against ministers came this morning, from the current chair of the committee for standards in public life, Sir Alistair Graham. He said the current \"ad hoc\" system of inquiries into allegations of ministerial wrongdoing - with a final ruling from the prime minister himself - was \"demonstrably redundant\". But Number 10 immediately moved to quash the momentum behind the call, which had been echoed by the Conservatives. Mr Blair's official spokesman said the decision on possible ministerial abuses must remain with the PM as he is accountable \"not just to parliament but also to the wider electorate\". He added: \"That is why the PM believes that in the end it's better that the prime minister who is constitutionally responsible for selecting ministers, in the end decides whether they have or have not abided by the ministerial code.\" The spokesman said an independent figure's adjudication would be no less controversial. Mr Blair has come under fire for ruling that Ms Jowell committed no breach of the ministerial code, after the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O'Donnell, earlier this week investigated the claims against her but passed a final decision on to Mr Blair. The PM also initially defended David Blunkett last year, before the then work and pensions secretary resigned over failing to declare his involvement with the DNA Bioscience firm with the relevant advisory panel on ministerial appointments. Pressure to reform the informal investigation of the ministerial code has grown. The committee on standards in public life first called for an independent investigator to be appointed in 2003, but this was rejected then by Mr Blair. Now the Tories - who are currently carrying out a \"Democracy Taskforce\" looking at this issue, among others - have called for an independent investigator. Oliver Heald, the shadow constitutional affairs secretary, said: \"We strongly support Sir Alastair's call for a more sensible way of investigating allegations of breaches of the ministerial code. \"Conservatives believe that case for independent investigation of alleged breaches of the code is overwhelming. \"Mr Blair's refusal to establish such a system is deeply damaging to public confidence in the way such matters are handled.\" In parliament, the Tories tried to force Commons leader Geoff Hoon into agreeing to a full debate on updating the code and a statement from the PM. Mr Hoon, though, dismissed the calls. \"The prime minister said you can't subcontract that decision and that is why I don't agree with the recommendation about an independent body,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
