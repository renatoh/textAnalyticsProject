Steve McManaman, who withdrew from the England squad for last week's friendly against Spain because of injury, started the game and created Raul's second goal. Real are now nine points ahead of their fierce rivals in the Spanish league with 13 games to play. Lille extended their French first division lead to three points when they beat Marseille 1-0 thanks to the goalkeeping excellence of Gregory Wimbee. And Sonny Anderson's 81st-minute goal secured a 2-1 victory for Lyon over their title rivals Bordeaux, who had been 1-0 up. Bayern Munich missed the chance to return to the top of Germany's Bundesliga after a shock 3-2 defeat at Hansa Rostock. They remain only one point behind Borussia Dortmund, the league leaders, but their manager Ottmar Hitzfeld questioned their ability to win a third successive title. \"We are in a very serious situation,\" said Hitzfeld, whose team have already lost as many games as in the whole of last season. \"The main problem is we are not aggressive enough and we cannot control a game.\" Bayern play Lyon in Group C of the Champions League tomorrow; Spartak Moscow, Arsenal's opponents in the same group, did not play at the weekend. Ruud van Nistelrooy made his long-awaited comeback from a knee injury on Saturday. The PSV Eindhoven striker, who came so close to joining Manchester United last year, came on in the 34th minute against Roda JC Kerkrade and although the game ended goalless he came the closest to scoring, hitting the bar from close range. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
