The rebooted Spider-Man franchise, launched almost as soon as Tobey Maguire had hung up his web-shooters, seems altogether redundant, but it must be said that Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man fulfilled its remit with laudable coherence and efficiency. His follow-up, though, is more like a taster menu than a movie proper, or like a garbled \"Previously on\u2026\" sequence that thinks it's a whole mini-series. Somehow Webb and the writers (including Star Trek duo Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci) shoehorn in a breathless backstory about Peter Parker's parents; some melancholy star-crossed business between Peter (Andrew Garfield) and his boffinish beloved Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone); the woebegone family life of tormented rich boy Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan, palely loitering); and a story about a lonely techie (Jamie Foxx, in comedy hair and teeth, playing it like Jerry Lewis's \"before\" persona in The Nutty Professor) who falls into a vat of eels and becomes the blue-skinned, translucent, galvanically overstimulated supervillain Electro. Electro is the film's prime attraction \u2013 a walking snap-crackle-and-pop son et lumiere show \u2013 and the main visual riff exploited this time is an enhanced version of the bullet-time effect from The Matrix, which can look pretty natty in a busy Times Square. But just when the action seems to have reached a bearable conclusion, we get not one, but two \"Oh no, now what\u2026\" surprise appearances by key Spider-Man villains: hardly narratively necessary, more a long-lead set-up for the Sinister Six spin-off currently in the works. For all the CGI pizzazz, this film only actually feels likable when Garfield and Stone do their insouciant double act \u2013 or when Garfield cheekily whistles the theme tune from the animated TV series. And still no J Jonah Jameson in sight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
