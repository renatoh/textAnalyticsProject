Man Financial is being sued by Clark Hodgson, the court-appointed receiver to an obscure Cayman Islands hedge fund, Philadelphia Alternative Asset Management (PAAM), which collapsed last year. Man said it \"categorically denies\" the receiver's allegations. Mr Hodgson, in an attempt to recover losses on behalf of investors, alleges that Man's broking business helped PAAM to operate a fraudulent scheme in which $179m (\u00a397m) of trading losses were hidden in a secret offshore account. The case is regarded in the hedge fund industry as a crucial test of the reputation of Man Group, a FTSE 100 company and world's largest publicly quoted hedge fund manager. Man's chief executive, Stanley Fink, has been enraged by the case. He has pledged that Man will fight vigorously what it calls \"outrageous, spurious and unsupportable\" allegations. The central claim is that Man Financial, which was PAAM's broker and executed trades on the fund's behalf, helped Paul Eustace, PAAM's manager, to hide his disastrous trading performance. Thomas Gilmartin, a senior vice-president of Man Financial and the individual in charge of PAAM's account, was a college friend of Mr Eustace. It is claimed that he helped to operate a secret account, known as the \"50 account\", in which losing trades were allegedly dumped in order to show profits in the so-called \"10 account\". Mr Eustace has agreed to submit to a lifetime trading ban and to pay restitution to investors in a settlement with US financial regulators, who pulled the plug on PAAM in June last year. Man maintains that it merely cleared trades for PAAM under instruction and that it accurately reported all the fund's activity in monthly statements to its directors. Man also renewed its bitter attack on the court-appointed receiver to PAAM yesterday, who filed the lawsuit in Pennsylvania district court. The receiver's decision to make use of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organisations act - known as Rico and originally designed as anti-mafia legislation - has particularly angered Man. \"Man believes that in bringing a claim under Rico the receiver is courting publicity,\" it said. \"Man Financial will defend itself against all actions, but the inclusion of Rico appears to be especially contrived and inappropriate.\" Mr Hodgson also filed his suit against seven Man employees, including Mr Gilmartin. Man said it was \"scurrilous\" that some administrative employees had been included, \"many of whom were only peripherally involved in the matter\". It added: \"This type of broad-ranging fishing expedition is unfortunately typical of the receiver's conduct of this case, which has been aggressive and unreasonable.\" The receiver filed 174 pages of exhibits in support of his suit. Many are internal emails that Man was obliged to divulge as a result of previous courtroom battles. Until a key case last December, which related to a separate contempt of court motion, Man had argued that the receiver's demands for documents were unreasonable and onerous. As in the past, Mr Hodgson has posted all the exhibits on his website. To Man's frustration, that will again provoke detailed scrutiny of the documents from financial bloggers who have been following the development of the case closely. Man's statement concluded by saying that it was noteworthy that Mr Eustace, in his consent to fraud charges filed by the US commodities futures trading commission, did not implicate Man Financial or any of its employees as knowing participants in his activities. \"The nature of the suit now being brought against Man Financial is simply a further attempt by the receiver to seek deep pockets,\" it said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
