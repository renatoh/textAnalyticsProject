An Association of British Travel Agents spokesman said British tourists were very resilient in their choice of holiday destination, and it took a lot, such as the Sars threat, to prevent them travelling. 'Worry of encountering anti-Western feeling is not enough to put people off and it tends to be directed to the government, not to tourists. A lot of people have been to these countries already and know they are some of the most hospitable countries in the world.' Thomson is trebling holidays to Egypt this winter and launching a brochure to support five new routes to Sharm el Sheikh and 22 new hotels in the Red Sea Riviera. Thomson, Thomas Cook, First Choice, Cadogan and Panorama have all increased holidays to Tunisia this summer, while Tunisia's visitor figures for April were up 59 per cent on last year. Gulf Air is launching a direct flight to Oman tomorrow, while sales to Jordan are up 200 per cent on 2003. 'We are, needless to say, located geographically in a noisy area, but I can assure travellers to Jordan of a very warm welcome from our people,' said a Jordan Tourist Board spokesman. And Turkey, on the border of the Middle East and Europe, is also experiencing a tourism boom. Libra Holidays launched its first trips there last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
