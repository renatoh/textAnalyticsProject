But the youngest back\u2011to\u2011back world champion took it well, admitting that he was so overwhelmed that his reaction to winning a second title was: \"Just as confusing as the first one, I have to say. It is hard to find the right words.\" Having taken third place to secure the point he needed behind Button and Fernando Alonso, Vettel did manage to elucidate more. \"To win the championship here is pretty special and a bit funny at the same time,\" he said. \"I think it will surely take a little bit of time but the season has been fantastic. \"I think the car this year was less dominant than the car last year. Last year we had so many races where sometimes you may say we were unlucky but we made stupid mistakes as well. We did things which cost us a lot of time and cost us a lot of points in the end. A championship is not one race, it's a lot of races pulled together and I think that's where the difference came from this year.\" That his car is less dominant than last year will be a moot point among his competitors but that he and the team have been more overwhelming, particularly in avoiding errors, is clear. \"We are very strong as a team,\" Vettel said. \"Every time it mattered, we made very few mistakes. Especially at those times when it was critical, we were there, we were performing. \"The secret, if there was one this year, is that we could trust, 100 per cent, the guy next to us and that's for the whole team. All year we tried very, very hard to keep our feet on the ground and always tried to focus on the next step, on the next race.\" Vettel's focus all season has never been in doubt. With nine wins and 12 poles he has been off the podium only once this year, an achievement that Button acknowledged as one of the keys to Vettel's success. \"However hard we have tried we haven't been able to touch him in a lot of races,\" he said, before noting that both his win and Vettel's title might take some time to appreciate. \"I was very happy, ecstatic,\" he said of the victory. \"This is a very special race to win, obviously not as big as Seb winning the world championship but winning a race like this does take a little bit of time to sink in. I remember when I won the world championship, immediately it was a strange feeling. It was like: 'what am I supposed to feel right now?' And it takes a little bit of time.\" Time is something the new double\u2011champion does not have right now, with the next race in South Korea a week away. \"Last year, after the chequered flag, it was all over and there was a long period of time when you weren't in the car again. So it's a bit different this year and it makes it even more special in a way,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
