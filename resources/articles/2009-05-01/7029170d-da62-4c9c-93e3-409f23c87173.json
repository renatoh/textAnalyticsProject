The Daily Telegraph reports that Darling and his colleagues were able to claim the money by using a fund set aside to help MPs with the cost of running an office. Until now the Telegraph, which has obtained a computer disc containing unedited information about the expenses claimed by all MPs, has mostly published information about the second home allowance. The revelations have already led to several MPs saying they will not fight the next election, two Labour MPs having the whip withdrawn and one minister leaving the government. The new allegations focus on office expenses. The sums involved are much smaller, but the coverage suggests some MPs could find their office claims just as embarrassing as their housing claims. It is alleged that the taxpayer has paid out more than \u00a311,000 to allow cabinet ministers to hire accountants. Other cabinet ministers who claimed for accountancy advice include Hazel Blears, the communities secretary; Geoff Hoon, the transport secretary; Jacqui Smith, the home secretary; David Miliband, the foreign secretary; Hilary Benn, the environment secretary; James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, and Douglas Alexander, the international development secretary. Gordon Brown, apparently, did not claim for accountancy advice. Darling claimed more than \u00a31,400 for accountancy advice over two years. One claim, in February 2008, included the cost of receiving advice on \"the treatment of rental expenses against income\", which seems to be a reference to his decision to rent out the flat he owned in London after he moved into a grace-and-favour apartment in Downing Street on becoming chancellor in 2007. Hoon claimed almost \u00a33,000 for accountancy \u2013 more than any other cabinet minister. Under tax rules, most workers are not allowed to claim the cost of paying an accountant to help them to fill in a tax return as a legitimate business expense. The Telegraph identifies other potentially embarrassing claims submitted by cabinet ministers as office expenses. \u2022 Harriet Harman, the leader of the Commons, charged more than \u00a310,000 to cover the cost of advice from a media trainer. Other ministers have also charged for media training, the paper says. \u2022 Ed Balls, the children's secretary, tried to claim for the costs of two Remembrance Day wreaths. His claim was rejected by the Commons authorities. (A spokesman for Balls later issued a statement saying that the claim for the wreath was submitted in error by a member of his staff in 2007 and that he paid for wreaths himself in 2005, 2006 and 2008, as he did in 2007 when the mistake was brought to his attention by the fees office.) \u2022 Smith used her expenses to pay for a \u00a3240 Apple iPhone for her husband, who works as her parliamentary assistant. \u2022 Blears and Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, were among eight ministers who claimed for digital cameras or camcorders using office expenses. The Telegraph also says that some MPs have been able to use office expenses to fund extensive work at their homes, on the grounds that part of their home is used as a constituency office. Office expenses are supposed to cover the costs associated with running an office and performing constituency work. The latest Telegraph revelations suggest that they were interpreted with some flexibility by the Commons authorities. But the paper also reports that some claims were turned down. It says that several ministers who submitted claims were warned by the fees office that they should not be using parliamentary expenses for purposes overtly related to party political campaigning. Asked why the taxpayer should be paying for services from an accountant, Darling told the Telegraph: \"Like many MPs, I employed an accountant to prepare tax returns for each of the years in question, to ensure that the correct amount of tax was paid.\" A Labour source said: \"The fees office green book which sets out the rules and advice on behalf of the parliamentary authorities states specifically that professional advice, for example from accountants or solicitors, is an allowable expense. \"In order that MPs comply fully with all the relevant requirements relating to tax, and to ensure they are properly meeting all their tax liabilities, many rightly seek professional assistance and advice where this relates specifically to their role as members of parliament.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 28 May 2009, to include the explanatory statement later issued by Ed Balls's office about payment for Remembrance Day wreaths."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
