England would then have the chance - with or without Ian Bell (we don't yet know whether he'll bat) - to take a decisive first-innings lead on a pitch that is flat, but not as conducive to strokeplay as, say, Kevin Pietersen might like. 2) New Zealand make 350-400 This is the no-man's land of first-innings scores on pitches such as this and would leave both sides with a chance of forcing a result. I also think it's the most likely of the three scenarios which I'm presenting as the only possible options. Because they are. 3) New Zealand make more than 400 Steve Harmison blows a gasket, Alastair Cook drops three sitters, Matthwe Hoggard goes in the back, and Monty gets done for excessive appealing. England collapse (without the injured Bell, naturally) and a new Schofield Report is commissioned. Stranger things have happened. And the bowlers? It depends if Harmison and Hoggard (36-3-159-2 between them yesterday) provide adequate back-up for Ryan Sidebottom and Panesar (47-15-105-3). It was a two-man effort, and that won't be good enough if England want to win this series. Ian Bell has apparently been having a bat this morning, but there's no news yet as to whether he'll be much use in this game [supply your own gag here]. I guess his move from No3 to No5 at least gives him a bit more breathing-space. \" Hell, an email! \"Glorious that the cricketing summer has started so early,\" enthuses Ian Copestake. \"Hamilton brings to mind another duel which this picture suggests is what cricket was invented to replace.\" What is Harmison's role in the side? asks Bob Willis. It's a fair question. Because if he's not being asked to blast out opening batsmen with the new ball, you do wonder. Nasser is asking why he never seems to be ready for the first Test of an overseas tour. Is there a real danger we won't see him in Test cricket after this series? But as I apply the knife, Jeremy Theobald is happy to twist it. \"After yesterday's placing of square cover, I'm wondering where Vaughan will place Steve 'Jonty' Harmison tonight to keep us entertained,\" he chuckles. \"I have to disagree a little Lawrence,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Anything beyond 320 would be very awkward for England with a fifth-day examination from Vettori and Patel in the offing. 380 looks pretty fatal to me - worringly, that's the mid-price on sportingindex's spread.\" I have to disagree too, Gary. Daniel Vettori is clearly class, but England have nothing to fear from Jeetan Patel. And if they do get a first-innings lead, which is well within the bounds of credibility if they keep New Zealand to under 400, it will be Monty who becomes the potential matchwinner. A classy stat from Willis, who is more than pulling his weight on his welcome return to the commentary box, reveals that Vettori is averaging 41 with the bat in his last 23 Tests. If he gets that many today, England might yet be in trouble. I'm trying to remember when a non-first day of a Test began without everyone proclaiming that the first session would be crucial. Well, the old cliche applies here. The second new ball is only six overs old and England have a great opportunity to knock New Zealand over for a very manageable first-innings total. But will Hoggard help out his partner-in-swing Sidebottom? \"As life got in the way of following the cricket yesterday, I have no idea why Hoggard bowled so poorly (according to his figures),\" says Ian Copestake. \"Any theories? Did he just have a bad day? But he won't let it happen again today, will he?\" I think there were moments early in the day when he searching too hard for swing: when it didn't materialise he was picked off leg-stump too easily. But in general he just looked a touch rusty. And here come the players... 91st over: New Zealand 283-6 (Taylor 55, Vettori 4) As yesterday, Sidebottom begins proceedings with a big lbw shout, this time against Taylor, who loses his balance as he tries to whip an inswinger to leg. Daryl Harper says no and I think he was right: that was missing leg. Taylor tucks the third ball to long leg for a single and Beefy reckons a few cracks are developing on the pitch. If he's right, and I wouldn't dare suggest otherwise, then it becomes all the more vital that England take a first-innings lead which is more than cosmetic. A tidy first over. 92nd over: New Zealand 288-6 (Taylor 56, Vettori 8) Hoggard prepares to go up for lbw against Taylor, but the ball is taken off middle stump at the last second and tucked to backward square for a single. Oohs and aahs pepper the Hamilton air. And then Vettori pulls for four as Hoggard drops short. Not the best ploy that, as we saw yesterday. \"Sorry to lower the tone with a cricketing question, but do you know the average bowling speeds from yesterday?\" asks an understandably red-faced Chris Herrington. \"How fast is Harmison bowling compared to Sidebottom and Hoggard?\" There wasn't much between the three of them, which tells you all you need to know about Harmy's state of mind. 93rd over: New Zealand 298-6 (Taylor 61, Vettori 12) Sidebottom begins with a wide one that fails to swing and is slapped through extra cover for four by Taylor, who follows it up with a quick single into the off-side. Sidebottom, who has smothered his face in what I hope is suncream, then oversteps - a transgression signalled by a shrill call from umpire Harper - before being cut for four by Vettori. Ten off the over and this has been a positive start by New Zealand. 94th over: New Zealand 302-6 (Taylor 65, Vettori 12) Hoggard beats Taylor outside off with a bit of late swing, but the threatening moments have been few and far between so far. And then Taylor brings up the 300 with a wild slash over the cordon and away to third man. \"The key to batting on a pitch that's going to get slower and lower,\" declares Huw Davies, \"is to bat for six and a half sessions and rack up 600 runs. Of course doing this in one innings is the tricky part.\" I see. 95th over: New Zealand 309-6 (Taylor 65, Vettori 19) More runs for Vettori, who rarely misses the chance to put away a bad ball and now flicks Sidebottom off his pads for four. Vettori then drives the next ball straight back to the bowler, who deflects it on to the stumps: the third umpire confirms Taylor got his bat down in time, and that's two runs. After bowling like a metronome yesterday, Sidebottom has conceded 17 runs in two overs. And England's hopes of dismissing New Zealand for under 350 are evaporating in the Hamilton sun. 96th over: New Zealand 310-6 (Taylor 65, Vettori 19) Yet again, England's pace bowlers are failing to work in tandem. Yesterday it was the fault of Hoggard and Harmison. Today, so far anyway, it's been the usually irreproachable Sidebottom. Why didn't Hoggard go up more convincingly for an lbw against Vettori? It pitched on leg and I reckon might have hit leg. But the appeal was half-ar$ed to say the least. The result is a leg-bye. Curious. \"As the only cricketing expert I know who's online at the moment not called Gary Naylor, who would you think should replace Harmison if, as is likely, he's utter toilet again for the match?\" asks Andy Bradshaw. Stuart Broad. 97th over: New Zealand 312-6 (Taylor 65, Vettori 21) Hawkeye says that one from Hoggard was missing leg comfortably, which rather contradicts my initial thought, as well as Beefy's harrumphed \"what's that missing?\" Meanwhile, Vettori collects two off Sidebottom with a thick inside edge - he's struggled with his line to the left-hander this morning. And at the back of England's mind will be the knowledge that at one point yesterday New Zealand were 191 for five. That pesky lower-middle order... 98th over: New Zealand 321-6 (Taylor 72, Vettori 23) Luck for Taylor, who drives airily at Hoggard and picks up four as the ball flies just out of reach of backward point. The next ball brings two to midwicket and the first half-hour has been all New Zealand: 39 runs was not a part of England's carefully prepared script. \"Why is the pitch being called slow?\" wonders, yes, Gary Naylor. \"The much-derided NZ batting order are going at a respectable three and a bit an over. I suspect that this will be an excellent wicket for 11 sessions of which England need to bat at least five.\" But why sit on the fence, Gary? 99th over: New Zealand 322-6 (Taylor 73, Vettori 23) When will Vaughan turn to Panesar, or even Harmison? This just isn't working for England, although Sidebottom thuds one into Vettori's pads. Again, England fail to appeal properly. What is going on? That might well have hit leg. Bizarre. \"I was a little surprised by your earlier comment that England have nothing to fear from Jeetan Patel,\" says Mark Gingell in Wellington. \"He may have been expensive in the shorter version of the game, but those of us down here watching his progress feel he is a genuinely developing talent. I fear your words could come back to haunt you!\" Yeah, I expect so. 100th over: New Zealand 331-6 (Taylor 82, Vettori 23) This is great stuff from New Zealand as Taylor thrashes Hoggard in the air through the covers and away for four and then punches his next ball down the ground to bring up the 50 stand. But England's lethargy is hard to credit. Their appealing has been truly dismal. \"England's bowlers are giving the impression they thought they just had to roll up today to polish off the innings,\" seethes Ian Copestake. \"Where do they get that misplaced confidence from?\" 101st over: New Zealand 337-6 (Taylor 83, Vettori 28) Hawkeye reckons that non-appeal from Sidebottom in his previous over was hitting the inside of leg-stump. Gah. Vettori cuts Sidebottom for four before being beaten outside off-stump, but this has been a dreadful morning so far for England: they have leaked 54 runs in 11 overs and forgotten that lbw is a mode of dismissal. \"If we (NZ) could sort out our top order, we would have the makings of a decent side,\" wails Simon Garrett. \"Hoping we can make 400 today as England should score easy against our pop-gun attack (excluding Dan of course).\" 102nd over: New Zealand 344-6 (Taylor 87, Vettori 30) Enter Harmy, whose first ball is tucked to backward square for two by Vettori, scoring almost exclusively square of the wicket. He is later slashed for four by Taylor, before beating him outside off with a delivery measuring 82.5mph, comfortably his quickest ball of the over. \"England look like a hungover pub side,\" rages Gary Naylor. \"Dismal body language, schoolboy appealing and feeding batsmen's strength. Moores is cricket's McClaren.\" Ouch. 103rd over: New Zealand 348-6 (Taylor 87, Vettori 34) A double change as Collingwood replaces Sidebottom, who, for once, had a terrible morning. And he might have had a wicket if Vaughan had posted a second slip, but instead it's four to Vettori off the outside edge. \"Is it too early to say how Tim Ambrose is doing on his debut?\" asks Paul Stones. \"Nothing too controversial in the first day and a bit so far it would seem.\" Yep. He's been pretty tidy so far. And he might yet have a role to play with the bat if Bell's right hand doesn't recover in time. 104th over: New Zealand 348-6 (Taylor 87, Vettori 34) Harmison is too wide of off-stump to trouble the right-handed Taylor - it's odd how he can bowl it straight at times but rarely in the corridor. A misleading maiden. And here come the drinks. England need 'em. \"I thought that only the NZ attack was of the cafeteria variety, but I am rapidly coming to the view that the English attack is not much better,\" scoffs Colin Lucas in Auckland. \"Harmison seems to be serving up nothing but pies!\" 105th over: New Zealand 353-6 (Taylor 91, Vettori 35) Taylor drives Collingwood gloriously down the ground for four to move into the nineties. As Bruce Forsyth would say, hasn't he played well! And he's even playing straighter too: England spent a lot of yesterday testing out the theory that he likes to play round his front pad. Not today. Here's Dominic O'Reilly. \"Do you think the England quicks are thinking, 'why am I flogging my guts out on a flat pitch in front of three men and a dog when I could have been counting my dosh for a bit of Twenty20 in India?' Or are they just poor?\" I'm sure the IPL thought has occurred to them, but this morning's display will have done nothing to encourage the Indian billionaires to part with their hard-earned. 106th over: New Zealand 355-6 (Taylor 91, Vettori 36) Here's Willis on Harmison: \"He's bowling at medium pace here - and not very accurately either.\" You've got to admire his facility for the withering. Moments later, umpire Steve Davis signals an off-side wide. \"Negative body language,\" drones Willis, seconds before Harmison almost yorks Taylor. That would have been amusing. \"Isn't England's plan obvious?\" says Mark Gilroy, paving the way for his own punchline. \"Try to keep New Zealand batting long enough for Ian Bell's wrist to recover, so he can bat. Maybe day four?\" 107th over: New Zealand 357-6 (Taylor 92, Vettori 37) At last, Panesar, and he almost beats Vettori with one that turns out of a small but noticeable patch of rough. This is looking increasingly ominous for England, who have got all they deserve out of this morning's lamentable showing. The batsmen exchange singles, but at least that resembled a tidy over. \"Although Jeetan Patel isn't as threatening as Murali or Harbhajan, he shouldn't be discounted - we've got four lefties in our line-up and he'll be useful turning the ball away from the bat on a wearing pitch,\" says Jon Ryan. \"With Fleming, Oram and Vettori in their team I suppose it's possible that Harmy could be replaced by Swann, if the selectors run out of patience. International players just don't seem to be troubled by the ball turning into them and that's why I thought we should have taken Monty and an offy to the Ashes last year to deal with Hayden, Langer, Hussey and Gilchrist. Still, at least most of our team are under 30 - here in Australia there's talk of replacing the Pakistan tour with a Saga holiday.\" 108th over: New Zealand 364-6 (Taylor 98, Vettori 38) Taylor pulls Harmison for a single, before Vettori works him off his legs for one more. And then Taylor moves to 97 with one of those flashing cover-drives: shot! A hesitant single to mid-off takes him to 98. \"I suspect, from the half-hearted appealing, the umpires may have intimated that nonsensical appeals will be heavily frowned upon, perhaps as against the fabled Spirit of Cricket, and England are playing along with the warning,\" says John Starbuck. \"What other explanation could there be?\" Well, the two shouts they failed to go up for were both leg-sidish - perhaps they just lost the courage of their convictions at the wrong moment. Either way, there's no excuse. 109th over: New Zealand 364-6 (Taylor 98, Vettori 38) Taylor tries to pierce the infield to take him to a maiden Test hundred, but Panesar is equal to the task. A nervy maiden. \"England's series with New Zealand always seems like two fat and pissed blokes having a 'shove each other' fight in a pub,\" chortles Dominic O'Reilly. \"It's so bad that no one can really be bothered to watch.\" I think New Zealand's batsmen might take offence at that, Dominic. The fat blokes have been all English so far. 110th over: New Zealand 369-6 (Taylor 102, Vettori 39) Vettori drops Harmison's first ball into the off-side and calls his partner through for the single which will give Taylor a potential five deliveries to score the two he needs. I hope he gets there: he's played superbly, insipid though England have been. He fails to score off the first three of them, including one agonising cut straight to point, but then pulls the fourth over square-leg for four. Well played! A cracking knock, from 185 balls with 16 fours, and a potentially match-winning one. 111th over: New Zealand 370-6 (Taylor 102, Vettori 40) The wagon wheel tells us that Taylor has scored his boundaries on the off-side and his ones and twos on the leg. That suggests an organised gameplan and it's taken New Zealand to the brink of my scenario 3), where a score of 400-plus lessens the chances of an England win. Vettori prevents a Money maiden with a sweep for one off the last ball. Half an hour to go before lunch and England desperately need a wicket. 112th over: New Zealand 371-6 (Taylor 102, Vettori 41) Harmison threatens to locate his line against the left-handed Vettori, but he's still hovering around 80mph. Or am I obsessing unfairly about speed? I said earlier that if Vettori reached 41 then England would be in trouble. OK, so it hardly a prophecy worthy of Mystic Meg, but the worrying thing is he's looked so untroubled. How different will this pitch seem when he gets a bowl I wonder. \"This is f***ing rubbish,\" says Phil Harrison, perhaps speaking for a nation. \"I'm going to bed. And I'm not even tired.\" 113th over: New Zealand 371-6 (Taylor 102, Vettori 41) Stop the press! England in proper-appeal shock! Vettori misses an attempted sweep off Panesar and is hit outside the line of off, but that didn't stop Monty trying to burst Daryl Harper's eardrums. That's more like it. A maiden. \"It's fair enough to berate England for failing to perform this morning,\" reckons Ian Copestake, \"but slagging off Harmison for negative body language is like criticising Keegan for an absence of defensive tatics, or suggesting Thatcher lacked femininity.\" 114th over: New Zealand 372-6 (Taylor 103, Vettori 41) Back comes Sidebottom for the ineffectual Harmison, who is surely not worth his place in what is essentially a four-man attack. Andrew Flintoff can't come back quickly enough. That was a better over from Sidebottom, who was weirdly off-colour this morning, and I'm not just talking about the great swathes of suncream he plastered across his face. Taylor scampers a quick single into the covers, but that's New Zealand's lot. \"Isn't the explanation for the lack of appealing a lack of confidence and concentration?\" says Gary Naylor, who in fairness sent his email in before Monty dared to go up for one. \"England look like it's all a bit too tedious for them to be playing in park where the spectators are sitting on grassy banks. They look like they're pleased just to get the ball to the other end without any damage done. Given that they are up against a man in his fourth Test and a No8, I fear I can't remember a poorer 90 minutes cricket from England. They were up against SK Warne in Adelaide after all.\" 115th over: New Zealand 376-6 (Taylor 104, Vettori 44) No wickets in the entire session is beyond England's most vivid nightmares, but it looks as if that's what's going to happen as Vettori elegantly late-dabs Panesar for three. 116th over: New Zealand 381-6 (Taylor 106, Vettori 46) Vettori brings up the 100 stand with a single off his hip off Sidebottom and I wonder what Peter Moores will say to his charges at lunch. Are there any positives for England to delude themselves with? None that spring to mind. New Zealand, by contrast, have been magnificent: Taylor has been aggressive, Vettori idiosyncratic, and they surely cannot now lose this game. Sidebottom strikes a blow of sorts by hitting Taylor on the helmet as he misses a hook, but we're talking straw-clutching here. 117th over: New Zealand 383-6 (Taylor 107, Vettori 47) It's dawning on me that the next three evenings promise little other than an England fight to arrive at Wellington at 0-0. Vettori drops Panesar into the off-side for a single, the 100th run of the session, and Taylor tucks him for one more to backward square. 118th over: New Zealand 387-6 (Taylor 111, Vettori 47) Lunch beckons and I don't even have the pleasure of food to look forward to. Dinner was soup, salad and toast before I left home, but it just feels wrong not to tuck into a great big sarnie as soon as the umpire flicks the bails off and heads for the pavilion. Wrong, I tell you. What's that? Oh, four to Taylor, who drives Sidebottom through extra-cover. 119th over: New Zealand 387-6 (Taylor 111, Vettori 47) I went for a jog with my brother earlier today and, in a blatant attempt to jinx the possibility, said Taylor and Vettori could easily add 100. Reader, it has come to pass and England need four quick wickets after the break if they are to have any chance of staying in this game. The session ends with a Panesar maiden to Vettori, but it's been New Zealand's morning: 105 without loss and with 450 now in their sights. See you at 12.10pm GMT to see how conservative they make that prediction look. You know you want to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
