But his competitive instinct remains intact even at 35 and last night, under the lights here, he broke both ducks to help end his former county's unbeaten run in this season's Twenty20 Cup. Hollioake had played only a bit-part with the ball, claiming the wicket of James Benning while conceding 31 runs off three slightly rusty overs. But by the time he walked out to bat, Essex were 124 for five in the 14th over in pursuit of 175 and in danger of throwing away their chances of going second in the South Division. Out came the cavalier spirit of old. Hollioake leg-glanced his first ball for four, then hit the lion's share of the 19 plundered off the next over from Nayan Doshi, including a six over long-on that seemed to have been plucked out of the archives for the occasion. By the time Azhar Mahmood bowled him for 21 off 12 balls the hard work had been done, although Surrey were left regretting a dreadful drop by Ali Brown at long-off to reprieve James Middlebrook with 16 still needed. Essex had been struggling when Matt Nicholson removed Grant Flower, Mark Pettini and Ryan ten Doeschate in his first three overs, and were in even further trouble when Chris Schofield bowled Andy Bichel after a brutal 35 to make it 76 for four. But James Foster changed the course of the match with 52 in 34 balls before the finishing touches were applied with seven balls to spare. The centrepiece of Surrey's 174 for four was a second-wicket stand of 103 in 12 overs between Benning, a possible wildcard for the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September, and Mark Ramprakash, who has nothing left to prove at this level but keeps scoring runs for fun anyway. Benning smote his way to 69 off 48 balls before having his stumps rearranged by Hollioake but Ramprakash kept going, as he tends to. He had already driven Martin Saggers, who is halfway through a month 's loan from Kent, down the ground for a pair of sixes when he slapped Hollioake, his former captain, for another straight six. If that shot might have been for old time's sake, the freedom of Ramprakash's innings rolled back the years, too. He finished with an undefeated 74 off 48 balls and boasts a Twenty20 average of almost 40, not to mention a strikerate of 132. For a player whose Test career buckled under the weight of others' expectation and his own, this competition is the final proof that a more expressive stroke-maker was always loitering with intent. The anguished what-ifs of his England days have given way to regal middle age."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
