This most divisive, bad-tempered election might not seem fertile ground for optimism. But we spotted plenty. A huge turnout. Heroic vote counters putting in magnificent double shifts. A determination to uphold democracy in the face of the pandemic. A robust institutional system, able to contain the sharpest differences of opinion and channel them towards a mandate. As for the outcome, the Upside has always steered clear of party politics. We prefer ideas to idealogues, zeal to zealots. We\u2019re more interested in the trial than the tribal. We are for collaboration, for innovation, for science, for honesty, for compassion, for ingenuity, for spirit, for courage in the face of adversity. We are for any president who embodies and encourages the same. And so to this week\u2019s list of the Guardian\u2019s most optimistic journalism, which includes: \u2022 Reasons to be hopeful in the US election. Three-minute read \u2022 C Covid vaccine approved by Christmas? Four-minute read \u2022 How Estonia excels at digital learning. Two-minute read \u2022 Culture to pick you up during lockdown. Mini-series \u2022 Therapeutic music in Nigeria. Three-minute read Lucky numbers Life expectancy in Australia has hit new peaks of 85 for women and almost 81 for men, according to official statistics. Elsewhere, I don\u2019t know what your record for keepy-uppy is, but I\u2019ll bet it\u2019s not 1.1m. This young lady topped that improbable total, and raised some cash for key workers in the process. And, from the world of cricket, we salute the sixiest batsman ever, Chris Gayle, via some wonderful writing from Andy Bull. What we liked The world\u2019s largest wind-powered ship is a salivating prospect, even if it is still at prototype stage. Jeff Bezos\u2019s $10bn Earth Fund is an equally salivating prospect\u2026 here the Atlantic reports on the principal beneficiaries. What we heard George Nixon has an offer that Upside readers cannot refuse. I can only describe it as a do-it-yourshelf library. George explains more here: It\u2019s really good to see the government has allowed libraries to stay open during this second lockdown so people can access books not via Amazon, but for some people that still might not be an option after a decade of austerity and local authority funding cuts. Bookshops are also still closed. During the first lockdown I posted pictures of my bookshelves on Twitter and Facebook in case anyone was interested in borrowing any of them, as they don\u2019t do much after I\u2019ve finished reading them. I\u2019ve reposted the original posts from March (I\u2019ve also bought plenty more books since then naturally...) and wondered if you wouldn\u2019t mind helping me get the word out please? They\u2019re all free, I just split the cost of postage with people, and it\u2019d be great to spread the word as far as possible This made us wonder if other Upside readers had initiative or lockdown antics they would like to share with the group? Do get in touch if so. Meanwhile, on Twitter, rubbercable reminded us of a piece from earlier this year about the fight against fake news Where was the Upside? With the Indian botanical enthusiasts trying to preserve crops in danger of going extinct. If you haven\u2019t already, sign up here to get this newsletter delivered to your inbox every Friday.
