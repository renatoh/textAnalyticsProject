Neath only yesterday let up in their threat to ban the Aberavon coach Chris O'Callaghan from the ground after he refused to apologise for comments he made in the programme for the first fixture between the sides in Port Talbot last September. O'Callaghan, saying the hatred between the clubs should be suspended for the afternoon, wrote: \"It's right to hate Neath: it's part of what we at Aberavon are all about. It's as natural as the stink from the steelworks or the lead which addles our brains. \"I was born in Neath, but won't admit it, lived in Neath, but want to forget it, and when I die I want to be buried face down in a mountain overlooking Neath with my arse sticking out.\" O'Callaghan said he was not willing to apologise because Neath had made a formal complaint to the Welsh Rugby Union rather than to him. \"We are bitterly disappointed that he has not seen fit to apologise to us, but we will let him in,\" said the Neath chairman Geraint Hawkes. \"It is time to let the teams do the talking on the pitch.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
