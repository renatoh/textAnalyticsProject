Then come the muttered recriminations. \"She has a point you know. If you'd been a bit more flexible this would never have happened ...\" And the backstabbing. \"Good riddance, if you ask me. Stuck-up bitch, always going on about her world-class profile.\" Friday's door-slamming by Imperial College as it announced it was severing its link with the University of London was expected, but is causing reverberations nonetheless. The link had been frayed for years, but when the college asked itself \"what's the point?\", it came up with no convincing answer. The rector, Sir Richard Sykes, never one to hang about, set in train the process, which was approved without dissent by his ruling council and which the university is making no attempt to oppose. There will be haggling over student facilities, and the divorce has to be approved by the Privy Council, but the deed is done. In a characteristically blunt comment to the college's student newspaper, Felix, Sir Richard said: \"Do we want to be badged as London University along with some less prestigious institutions?\" Rodney Eastwood, the college's director of strategy, is more diplomatic. \"The Imperial brand is strong and well recognised throughout the world. The University of London doesn't add anything to that.\" Having a federal university had not facilitated collaboration with other universities, and the common London degree had not meant students could move between colleges, he said. Imperial will save \u00a3400,000 in subscriptions and as much again in payments for services. Imperial's departure has forced the other 19 members of the London club to ask themselves what the point is. No one has yet come to Imperial's bleak conclusion, but enthusiasm varies. Remaining members are demanding subscriptions are cut and what they see as the overloaded bureaucracy of Senate House is pruned. A case in point: the university council was involved in a fractious exchange last week about a wiring contract for Senate House. It has 70 members. That may be suitable for an institution that exercises detailed control of the funding and academic standards of each constituent college. But it is not appropriate for one that surrendered virtually all its powers a decade ago to what are independent universities in all but name. David Latchman, master of Birkbeck, who is very supportive of the university, said the governing council was an example of arrangements that had not been changed in the 1994 reforms but needed to be \"hacked away\" now. Rick Trainor, principal of King's College, said Imperial's departure was \"regrettable\" but would not make much difference to the future of the federal university. He too wants to see \"urgent radical reform\" by the end of the current academic year to prune the bureaucracy and give the colleges more influence on how the university is run. King's College is internationally known, Trainor says, but the University of London name is a help when it comes to recruiting overseas students. \"If you have an institution with a well-established international reputation, why would you want to remove that?\" Less enthusiastic The heads of Queen Mary and Royal Holloway both leapt to the defence of the federal university last week. Both have incorporated the University of London name in their titles. Goldsmiths College is likely to follow suit. The London School of Economics is much less enthusiastic about what it gets for its \u00a3272,000 a year subscription. \"LSE is not currently considering leaving the University of London. The school may wish in the future to exercise degree-awarding powers while remaining in the University of London. What other colleges do is for them to decide,\" said a statement that suggests its director, Sir Howard Davies, would not be broken-hearted to follow Sir Richard out of the club door. Most discontented is UCL, but it is inextricably intertwined with the University of London estate in Bloomsbury, so any divorce would be extremely messy. The provost, Malcolm Grant, might well feel he has too much on his plate trying to balance his own books with a 15% cut in staff over the next three years to embark on declarations of independence. But he sees last week's announcement as very bad news. \"UCL deeply regrets Imperial's decision to leave the federal university, because it can only harm the university to have one of the UK's world-class research institutions depart. Radical reform \"UCL is not proposing to follow suit - at least at the moment - but will seek to compel radical reform in the governance and cost-effectiveness of the university.\" Sir Graeme Davies, the vice-chancellor of the University of London, says reforms are already in train with a view to cutting college payments by about 10%. Not a man for histrionics, Davies has appeared laid back about Imperial's defection. It's \"disappointing\", he says, but Imperial has been de facto independent for a long time. He points out that the Central School of Speech and Drama recently joined the university and others might do so in the future. City University is gossiped about as a candidate, as is the University of the Arts London - a rumour its vice-chancellor, Sir Michael Bichard, has been at pains to squash. Perhaps more threatening to the university in the long run was last month's critical report from the higher education watchdog, the Quality Assurance Agency, which was not satisfied with its oversight of degree standards. Davies says he is in dialogue with the QAA over what he feels is a misunderstanding about the role of the federal university. All the constituent colleges have been passed with flying colours, so there should be no question about standards, he says.
