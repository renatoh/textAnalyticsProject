Well, they almost reached the offices. The council, having got wind of the silent protest, overreacted hilariously by closing the main gates to the North London Business Park, mounting extra security and alerting police; two police vans hovered nearby as the cheerful protestors silently waved their banners. The proposed cut amounts to 11% of artsdepot's income, and seems particularly brutal given that the North Finchley venue has been such a success since it was created (ironically, by the council) six years ago. As its director, Nigel Cutting, said: \"If it goes through, Barnet will be one of the largest councils in the country to spend nothing on the arts. A local authority area with twice the population of Oxford at least deserves a degree of arts provision.\" There is still time to stop the cut \u2013 the consultation finishes next Monday. The planned Barnet cut comes on top of the decision by London Councils (the umbrella body for local authorities in the capital) to axe the \u00a33m it spends on arts provision. The idea is that these spending decisions are being devolved back to the boroughs but, frankly, what are the chances of the boroughs spending an equivalent amount of money? Zero? The decision, made before Christmas by council leaders, means that theatres and organisations across London will all lose money. Theatre Royal Stratford East, for example, is losing \u00a380,000. Artsdepot, meanwhile, is again in the firing line, losing two grants that amount to \u00a3130,000. The eye-spinning plans to create the world's biggest arts complex in Hong Kong have suffered a major blow with the departure, after just five months, of its British chief executive, Graham Sheffield. It was announced on Friday that Sheffield, the much-respected former artistic director of the Barbican, had been advised by his doctor to resign immediately. The West Kowloon plans are certainly ambitious. Covering nearly 100 acres and with an initial cost of about \u00a31.8bn, the aim is to create a vast cultural theme park encompassing theatre, dance, music, film and visual arts. But will it happen? The project has been dogged by numerous problems and delays, and Sheffield is not the first to go \u2013 former executive director Angus Cheng resigned for \"personal reasons\" in June 2009. A global search for Sheffield's successor has now begun, and a decision is also imminent on which overall building design will be chosen from a shortlist that includes Norman Foster, Rem Koolhaas and local architect Rocco Yim. Definitely Hong Kong-bound is Damien Hirst, who is exhibiting new paintings and sculptures at a show that opens at the region's new Gagosian gallery next Tuesday. The most eye-catching piece will be a variation on his \u00a350m diamond-encrusted skull, For the Love of God. Those at the frontline of arts cuts may be particularly keen to know that it will, this time, consist of a human baby skull cast in platinum and encrusted with 8,128 pav\u00e9-set perfect diamonds, 7,105 natural fancy pink diamonds and 1,023 white diamonds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
