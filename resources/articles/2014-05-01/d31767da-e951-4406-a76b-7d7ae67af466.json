Just like Shane Warne\u2019s improbable storylines, Lance Franklin\u2019s career goes in weird and wonderful ways. Football freakishness aside, his deal at the Swans was also about his ability to fill conversations and stadiums. After a flat start to Swan Life, Friday saw Buddy produce far from his greatest performance, but definitely a compelling narrative. In his first game against Hawthorn \u2013 the side he left to fly to Sydney in a zeppelin fuelled by burning money \u2013 the Hawks were top of the ladder while Sydney had been struggling. Running wide into the left pocket to shape back one of those long left-footers, Franklin missed. Snapping round the body after a hand-off, he missed. Contested mark right in front, missed. Gymnastic stretch to reel in another mark, missed. Sneakily playing on from a free kick to bomb from 50, missed. Routine mark on the lead, missed. A right-angled checkside from on the behind line, missed. That made seven points. Marking on the lead in the forward pocket, he lost confidence and passed instead. Missed. A one-hander in the last quarter, another missed attempt to dish off. Finally, from a set shot, he struck one cleanly. Goal. Minutes later Lewis Jetta slapped the ball his way, Buddy tried to spin away from a tackle, and while turning 270 degrees, he scrubbed a kick away while falling to the ground beneath Ryan Schoenmakers. It rolled 20 metres straight through. For those saying Buddy has to win games for the Swans, Sydney exceeded Hawthorn\u2019s score by exactly two goals and seven points. The Bloods are back It\u2019s worth mentioning what an achievement that was for Sydney. Three rounds ago they were dangling like short-term Sylvester Stallone co-stars in 13th place. Now they\u2019ve scooted up the cliff to clip their caribeners securely onto the zip-line of the top four. That\u2019s on the back of four wins in a row. Sydney\u2019s renowned pressure ruined the Hawks\u2019 finesse game, keeping the league\u2019s most prolific scorers to 13 goals from eight players. The Swans bossed the match early, slipped behind in the third quarter, but rallied to take back the lead. Kurt Tippet and Franklin played together for the first time, Franklin providing the vaudeville while Tippett kicked four goals. Dan Hannebery rebounded after criticism of his form, racking up 40 possessions and the match-sealing goal to be best on ground. Those of us who tipped Sydney as 2014 contenders are starting to look marginally less stupid. The bag is back Comedy may have inspired Franklin to sacrifice his chance at nine goals, but on the other side of the country, another sometime slapstick artist proved the entertainment value of the straight man. West Coast\u2019s Josh Kennedy lined up for 11 goals from 11 attempts on Sunday as his side thrashed the Giants. It\u2019s a fair lament that the modern game no longer allows many big hauls from key forwards. We can only hark back to the time when John Coleman kicked 32 against the Wendouree Space Lords while also winning an amateur golf tournament. But once in a while we get an afternoon like this. Aside from jittering toward goal like a meth enthusiast down the aisle of a Collingwood tram, Kennedy could have been channelling a performance straight from the 1980s. Lead out, chest mark, kick a goal, kick a goal, lead out, chest mark, kick another goal. The fact that a couple were complete shanks that somehow swerved through only added to the delight. The bump is back Or rather, it was this round, but its practitioners won\u2019t be back next game. So far this season we\u2019ve discussed alleged bumps more often than gossip columnists. Several players have been suspended, while Jack Viney successfully appealed last week. Given Viney was almost suspended for having a guy crash into him using his face, you\u2019d think it might make other AFL players cautious. Instead the response seems to have been \u201cBashing heads in with our shoulders, you say? Hmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.\u201d Recent suspension theory is not complex: if you aim to smash a guy with your shoulder, don\u2019t hit him in the head. Jarryd Roughead, a man the size of a phone booth, might have reconsidered hitting Ben McGlynn, a man the size of a fire hydrant. Bulldog forward Liam Jones rammed the full force of his shoulder into Dean Terlich\u2019s jaw. Fremantle\u2019s Paul Duffield left Chad Wingard dazed on the Adelaide Oval turf, then turned to the umpire looking guilty as all hell. West Coast\u2019s Mark LeCras leapt off the ground just to be sure, copping Will Hoskin-Elliot square in the head. Bomber Paul Chapman went to bump Brisbane\u2019s Jack Redden, couldn\u2019t quite reach, and hung out an elbow to make up the difference. All five will inevitably be suspended. \"We're really supportive of the bump rule,\u201d said Demons coach Paul Roos after watching his man Terlich get knocked out. \u201c[A]s far as I'm concerned it's black and white. If you choose to bump when you have an alternative then you suffer the consequences. Jack Viney did not bump.\u201d Does everybody have that down for Round 9? The boom player is backing it up As Port Adelaide shot to the top of the table, it was the aforementioned Wingard pulling the trigger. In fact, once he\u2019d shaken off the grogginess, the shoulder charge that had ironed him out seemed to wake him up. His five goals against such a defensive team as Fremantle was the difference on the day, but most impressive was the intensity and energy with which he created them. First he crumbed a pack and squeezed out a high dink of a kick under extreme tackling pressure. Then he sprinted back to the behind line to haul in a rainmaker, kicking a left-foot checkside from his set shot. He attacked the footy at half forward, forcing it on by momentum alone, then ran to receive the handpass and drive a long ball home. He sped by another pack at the perfect pace to receive a volleyball tap and snap his fourth, then took one of the marks of the year, leaping up, catching a ride with his hip that spun him 180 degrees, but somehow looking back over his shoulder to take the ball in flight. There has been a lot of excitement about Wingard, and here he showed the kind of style that lifts team-mates with its audacity and confidence. If Port are to sustain their run this year, Wingard will be one of the key drivers. So far he\u2019s been able to deliver."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
