About 300 protesters took over central Bendigo last Saturday, lashing out against a legal decision by the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal to approve construction of Bendigo\u2019s first mosque. \u201cIf this video gets 1,000 shares, I\u2019ll get all my UPF boys, and in three weeks\u2019 time, march back right back into Bendigo again,\u201d Burgess said in a video posted to the group\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cAnd this time, I will be in Bendigo with them.\u201d In a subsequent video, Blair Cottrell, another spokesman for the group, confirmed the UPF would be returning to Bendigo, as the target had been met. The group claims the mosque will bring more Muslim immigrants into Bendigo, as a first step to sharia law. Commenting on the prospect of another anti-mosque rally, Peter Cox, the city\u2019s mayor, said: \u201cWe can do without that kind of publicity, but it just strengthens our resolve to get the mosque built. \u201cThey are using this as a political game. They drape themselves in the Australian flag yet they are not willing uphold the Australian constitution in terms of freedom of religion and beliefs.\u201d \u201cI think the very small local group [of mosque opponents] is being used by the national organisation. It\u2019s a political campaign of no real substance.\u201d Cox has released a factsheet to counter some of the claims made by the anti-mosque group. He said the litigants against the mosque had until Thursday to appeal their case to the supreme court. Kim Vuga, from the SBS program Go Back to Where You Came From, spoke at the rally. \u201cIt\u2019s not radical Islam but Islam itself that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Vuga said. \u201cWe are already living with the enemy and, yes, we are under attack.\u201d Keysar Trad, spokesman for the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia, said: \u201cThese people are talking about issues they don\u2019t understand. If I was to ask any of them what the word sharia meant I don\u2019t think any of them would know.\u201d The Melbourne-based group No Room for Racism launched a counter-rally in response, turning up in roughly equal numbers to the anti-mosque group. Many members of Saturday\u2019s anti-mosque protest had travelled from interstate. When speakers at the protest asked who was local, many raised their hands. But locals interviewed on the morning of Saturday\u2019s rally were largely supportive of the mosque. They expressed concern at the impact of the rallies on Bendigo\u2019s businesses and reputation. Businesses have been particularly affected by the rallies. During Saturday\u2019s rally, many were forced to close or reported lost trade. Steven Blundell, the president of the Bendigo Traders Association, said businesses would suffer further if the anti-mosque group returned. James Jupp, from the Australian National University, said mosque protests were common and anti-Islamic groups such as the UPF had become more prominent in the past few years. But he said such groups tended to be fragmented and struggled to maintain momentum. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of angry people in these things and they don\u2019t get on with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t find a significant leader or individual, things tend to fall apart.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
