Today's incident was the third time this week that somebody has set themselves alight near the embassy, which is in Knightsbridge. The police chief in charge of operations outside the embassy, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Trotter, said: \"About six police officers immediately went over to the man, put out the fire with fire extinguishers and wrapped him in fire blankets. He is now in hospital in a serious condition.\" Iranians have been protesting against a raid by French authorities in Paris against opposition group, the People's Mujahedeen of Iran, in which more than 150 people were arrested. The left-wing Mujahedeen, which wants to overthrow Islamic rule in Iran, has been banned by EU states as a terrorist organisation. On Tuesday, Heshmat Zandi, 38, a mechanical engineering student who lived in Borehamwood, Herts, doused himself in petrol and set himself alight, causing 40% burns to his body. An Iranian woman also set herself on fire outside the embassy. Ambulance crews rushed her to hospital in a serious, but not life-threatening, condition after putting out the flames. She was named by the National Council of Resistance of Iran as Neda Hassani, 25, an Iranian living in Canada who was on holiday in the UK. Mr Trotter appealed to the demonstrators not to resort to such \"appalling\" forms of protest. He said he was \"very concerned indeed\" about the incident, adding that his officers would step up security and searches of people around the embassy. He continued: \"We're very concerned about police officers having to go and deal with someone on fire and put them out. I commend them for their bravery, and it's also very distressing for them to do this. \"I would appeal to demonstrators that this mustn't happen again: this is really appalling. The main thing for us to do is to search people coming in here, be vigilant, be aware and try to stop people harming themselves as quickly as we can.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
