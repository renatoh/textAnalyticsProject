Not the sport itself despite the well-publicised threat from the Office of Fair Trading but the name. A spokesman from the British Horseracing Board has confirmed that a name change is being discussed. Traditionalists would despair but with a hunting ban back on the political agenda, would the sport want to be associated with an outlawed pastime? Appearing on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! raised pop singer Peter Andre's profile to new heights and Aintree are expecting up to 10,000 when he appears at their Ladies' Night fixture a week on Friday. Andre, about to embark on a UK tour, will perform his chart hits in front of the grandstands after racing.The course couldn't confirm if glamour model Jordan, who is apparently stepping out with Andre since they met in the jungle, will be there too. For those who can't wait for the new racing channels to start, you can get hold of what we can only presume are bootleg DVDs, featuring all the racing everyone has missed since Attheraces went off the air.

News of the BBC's plans to cut back on racing, headlined in yesterday's papers, also first appeared here a month ago. Sometimes you just have to blow your own trumpet. There can't be many more versatile horses than last Monday's Towcester winner Translucid. In his last 12 starts Translucid has finished first or second in five countries. He's also reached the first two in Flat turf races, on the all-weather, over hurdles and over fences. Translucid is trained by a German, Christian von der Recke, who's versatile himself. A couple of seasons ago he had winners in 11 countries and runners at 64 different tracks. In the novel by Raymond Chandler, Farewell My Lovely , the character of Moose Molloy, memorably described as being 'as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel's food' and 'as big as a beer truck', is looking for Velma, an 'ex-warbler in a nightclub'. Moose Malloy, a seven-year-old gelding, is a novice hurdler of very little ability. 'Soon turned it in on his latest outing,' says Timeform ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
