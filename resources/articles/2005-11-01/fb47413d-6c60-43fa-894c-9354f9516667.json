It certainly helped me through a week in Singapore a few years ago, when shuttling between hot, humid streets and air-conditioned restaurants threatened to exhaust me. I was at first wary of the intense perfume of this infusion, but before long I was addicted. The steaming, fragrant tea was hydrating and reviving, and a great accompaniment to spicy foods. Jasmine tea is essentially green tea, which comes from the same plant as standard black tea, but the leaves are unoxidised. This means it's lighter in flavour and colour. It also has less caffeine (though still some) and is especially high in antioxidants (some US doctors consider three cups of green tea wholesome enough to constitute one of our daily fruit and veg portions). Inferior brands are green leaf simply sprayed with a synthetic perfume. The good stuff is infused by being mingled with freshly picked jasmine flowers, then dried - the process being repeated several times. I struggled to find a brew as good as the ones I drank in Singapore until a friend introduced me to Jing Tea's jasmine pearls. These little grey balls, when steeped in water for five minutes off the boil, release a deep but delicate flavour. More than a reviving drink, this tea is so fragrant, it encourages a mid-afternoon ritual - pretty china cup, a moment of peace. You can capture the unique perfume in other ways, too: try infusing it in a custard or syrup. Order from jingtea.co.uk or search out the good stuff in Chinese groceries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
