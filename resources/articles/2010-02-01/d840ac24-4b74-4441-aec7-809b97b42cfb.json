The gallops at Richards's Greystoke yard near Penrith have been frozen almost constantly since mid-December, so he sent a handful of his more talented charges to be quartered with Geoff Wragg, the retired Flat trainer, 250 miles to the south. \"Basically, we were stuck,\" he said in the winner's enclosure after his 12-year-old beat Alberta's Run. \"I had to do something or I wouldn't have had enough fit horses.\" There is no prospect of Richards leaving the stable where his father, Gordon, trained with so much success. But this was a rare success for him in a major race in the south, the 2007 victory by Monet's Garden in the same race being another example. The grey will not, however, be sent for a fourth assault on the Cheltenham Festival, with the Grand National meeting his next possible target. According to Richards the veteran will be kept in training \"as long as he's happy and well. Greystoke seems to be a place that can keep these old battlers going a bit longer than other places. It's a pleasure for a jockey, I would imagine, to be sitting up there, singing a song and having a great old time of it.\" It was a good day for greys from the north, as Haydock's big race, the Blue Square Gold Cup, was won in impressive style by Silver By Nature, trained near Perth by Lucinda Russell. At the owner's request, the horse has no entry in the Grand National and will try to win the Scottish equivalent. Dessie Hughes, the Co Kildare trainer, has every reason to be pleased about his prospects in the National, after Vic Venturi and Black Apalachi gave him a one-two in the Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse. \"This was a fantastic result,\" he said. \"We now have two Aintree contenders.\" There was less enthusiasm from Harry Findlay, who welcomed a winner in his colours at Ascot but then struck a downbeat tone when asked about the Cheltenham Gold Cup chances of Denman. Findlay poured cold water on any hope that a lack of fitness might account for the horse's shock defeat at Newbury last Saturday, when he unseated Tony McCoy while under pressure from moderate rivals. \"I know one thing, Denman was flying [at home],\" he said. \"I heard things about Denman before that race I ain't never heard before and, unless I'm reading the vibes out of the yard wrong, his defeat was a big, big shock.\" Findlay added that the horse's current odds of 7-2 to beat Kauto Star at the Festival were \"about right\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
