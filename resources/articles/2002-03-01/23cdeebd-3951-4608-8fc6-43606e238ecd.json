The project started by looking at the election, but quickly moved on to art, music, philosophy, and current events such as the September 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan. The library fears that as national debate and culture takes place increasingly online, large parts of our collective heritage are being lost to the ephemeral nature of the internet. According to the Digital Preservation Coalition, the average life of a web page is six to seven weeks, making it difficult for people to go back to information found online. Stephen Bury, the head of European and American collections at the library, said there is a need for an objective, trusted archive that will still be around in 200 years. Mr Bury said that without the archive, important aspects of British culture will disappear as websites change. He sited an art project in which a London taxi became a roving canvas. The taxi has ceased to do its rounds, but the project is preserved - for now - at cabgallery.com. However future generations would lose access to the project if it is not archived. \"Increasingly the internet is being used by scholars, and an average PhD today will have 20 to 30 references to websites as they appeared on a particular day, and there is not future proof of that. There is no way to know if that paper is telling the truth,\" he said. Mr Bury and his team are now asking for \u00a3600,000 from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to fund an archive of 10,000 UK sites, including facilities for public access to the information. The pilot project, with its 100 site search, collected approximately 20,000 pages, so the full project will require substantially more time and money. The British Library wanted to move quickly, before even more of the country's heritage disappeared from the internet. Mr Bury envisaged that in the next election every candidate could have a website, creating between 4,000 and 5,000 sites that should be preserved. He also wanted to see a legal compulsion upon sites to allow snapshots of their information to be archived, the way publishers must deposit all books published in the UK with the library. Without that change, the library had to contact each site to seek permission to archive their material."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
