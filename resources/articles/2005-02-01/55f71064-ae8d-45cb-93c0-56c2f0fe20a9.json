Reyes admitted in a radio interview, when he was duped into believing he was talking to Real Madrid sporting director Emilio Butragueno, that he dreamed of moving to the Spanish club. But today Wenger insisted the winger, who is understood to be homesick, would have to demand a move as he has no intention of selling him. Though it is now clear that Reyes is unsettled, the Gunners boss backed him to come through this test of character. \"We signed Reyes as a 20-year-old and we have gone for the challenge of making him into one of the big players in the world,\" said Wenger. \"This doesn't change my determination to see that through. You know, within that period, that the player will have ups and downs.\" \"It's not easy for him. But if you want to go abroad, you have to accept it won't be easy. It's the same for everybody. That's part of the challenge.\" \"If you want to have a big player - like he will be, I'm still convinced of that - there will be periods where you're not too happy. You can ask Michael Owen. He's had periods like it too.\" \"He wouldn't have been feeling like this at all when he was scoring goals in September. We've all been 21 and could have said something like this when we were going through a bad period. But we have a good Spanish troop here. He has integrated and is loved by everybody. That will help him to go through periods like that.\" \"It is a big challenge for him. I feel for him, but when it doesn't go as well as he expected it to, he must show the strength that is needed. If he doesn't, he will [still] not be happy.\" Reyes, 21, has been angered by the underhand tactics of Spanish radio station Cadena Cope, while it is also understood he did not use the phrase \"bad people\" to describe his Arsenal team-mates. However, there was little question of his desire to return to Spain as he had admitted: \"I wish I was playing for Real Madrid. It has always been my dream since I was little to play there.\" Wenger responded: \"He has the right to have a club of his dreams in his country. Who wouldn't have that?\" Having realised he had been caught out, Reyes yesterday released a statement through Arsenal, pledging his commitment to the club. Despite acknowledging the difficulties experienced by the Spaniard and his family in settling in London, Wenger is confident he will still stay at Arsenal. \"I rate him still,\" he insisted. \"There is no reason why I should sell the player. It's simple. If a player wants to leave he has to knock at my door and tell me and then he has to bring a club that wants to buy him.\" \"My commitment and desire to keep the player is stronger than ever because I believe in him and that's it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
