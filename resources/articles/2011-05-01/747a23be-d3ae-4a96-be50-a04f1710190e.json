At his quarterly inflation report briefing, the governor said growth would be weaker, and inflation higher, than the Bank set out in its last set of forecasts three months ago. \"There is no doubt that we are facing a difficult time ahead,\" he said. The Bank is expecting domestic gas bills to increase by 15% and electricity bills by 10% this year in the latest blow to household finances from high energy prices. King admitted that inflation is \"uncomfortably high\", and warned there is \"a good chance\" that it will reach 5% before dropping back in 2012 and 2013. The governor said he expected the economy to recover from its weak performance over the past six months, which has seen GDP growth effectively flat since the autumn \u2013 but he conceded that the Bank had been forced to revise its forecasts down sharply over the past year, as growth has repeatedly disappointed. \"A year ago, we thought that growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 would be 1.5%,\" he said. \"That hasn't happened. What we have seen is a soft patch.\" Labour seized on the downgrading of the Bank's forecasts to blame the chancellor George Osborne for clobbering the economic recovery. Angela Eagle, the shadow Treasury minister, said \"cutting too deep and too fast, as this Conservative-led government is doing, is a vicious circle\". However, King said the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) expected growth to bounce back later in the year, driven by a stronger trade performance and a resurgence in business investment. Hopes of a boost from stronger exports gained some support from yesterday's official trade figures, which showed that the quarterly goods deficit in the first three months of the year, at \u00a39.3bn, was the lowest since the end of 2009. Measured by volume, exports were up 18.9% year on year in the first quarter. Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citi, pointed out that car exports had risen by 45% on a year ago. \"Exports of cars have been rising strongly for two years, and this probably owes a lot to the plunge in sterling since early 2007. The stimulus from the low pound is far from exhausted, and should continue to provide a major boost to exports \u2013 and GDP as a whole \u2013 for quite a few years to come.\" Sterling rose after the inflation report was published, as City analysts brought forward their predictions of an interest rate hike on the basis of the MPC's higher inflation forecasts. But analysts said the combination of above-target inflation and anaemic growth would make the next two years painful for consumers, who have already faced declining real wages for the past 12 months. \"This is another sombre assessment of the UK economy,\" said Esmond Birnie, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \"A challenging and uncomfortable time lies ahead for households struggling to make ends meet, for the Bank's monetary policy committee in terms of trying to retrieve some inflation-fighting credibility and for the coalition government in terms of applying the planned fiscal squeeze.\" King also warned that the continuing weakness of Britain's banking sector is holding the MPC back from raising interest rates to tackle inflation, which hit 4% in March. The Bank's analysis shows that lenders are paying much more than the 0.5% base rate to raise money in financial markets, which is feeding through to higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. \"There's no quick fix here,\" the governor said. \"Once you have had a major financial crisis, it's a matter of years before the health of the banking sector can be restored.\" The MPC is also watching developments in the crisis-hit eurozone, amid fears the continuing uncertainty over the fate of Greece could rock international markets in the coming months. Charlie Bean, the Bank's deputy governor, said \"the main impact to us would be not through trade linkages, but \u2026 concerns about counterparty exposure through the banking system, which could lead to a further tightening in the bank funding and financial markets.\" The MPC has been deeply divided for several months about whether to increase interest rates in the face of stubbornly high inflation. Andrew Sentance, the independent economist who will leave the committee at the end of this month, has repeatedly voted for a rate rise, but King has described a one-off increase to placate City doubts about the Bank's inflation-fighting credibility as a \"futile gesture\". King took care to stress yesterday that there are differences of view on the committee, and greater than usual uncertainty about the outlook. \"With uncertainties persisting in terms of commodity prices, the various factors that are muddying the picture of economic growth in the UK (such as extreme weather and extra bank holidays), the debt crisis in the euro area, the political situation in the Middle East and the still-unknown impact of the Japanese earthquake on supply chains, it is likely these divisions will remain a feature of policymaking for some time to come,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
