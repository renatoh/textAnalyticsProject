We\u2019re broke people.\u201d As Whitt, 34, pedalled back to the store with his receipt, he sensed a car approaching from behind and heard a crushingly familiar sound. \u201cHe put the siren on,\u201d said Whitt. \u201cWhoop, whoop!\u201d A cop asked him what Whitt was doing in the area. He wanted to see his identification, and rifled through his shopping bag to see what he was carrying. Then, he ran Whitt\u2019s name in search of outstanding warrants. \u201cI told him \u2018that\u2019s illegal, you\u2019re violating my rights\u2019,\u201d said Whitt. \u201c\u2018I have not broken the law. You ain\u2019t got probable cause for nothing\u2019. He told me \u2018I can cite you for not wearing a helmet\u2019.\u201d Whitt was eventually freed to go. But he was left incensed. \u201cI wanted to shoot that motherfucker,\u201d he said this week. \u201cI wanted to. Because he had no right to bother me.\u201d The raw fury in this northern suburb of St Louis over the killing of Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old apparently walking back from a convenience store, may slowly fade in the coming weeks and months. But the underlying, bitter resentment among many in the local African American community about their treatment at the hands of an almost unanimously white police force and local authorities, will likely continue to simmer. Ferguson\u2019s population is 67% black, but 50 of Jackson\u2019s 53 police officers \u2013 94% \u2013 are white. Figures published last year by Missouri\u2019s attorney general showed seven black drivers were stopped by police for every white driver, and that 12 times as many searches were carried out on black drivers as white. The sharp disparities fuel mistrust, residents said. \u2018A subculture of prejudice\u2019 Asked about race relations at a press conference on Wednesday, Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged that there was a \u201ccommunity that is at odds with us now\u201d. He said: \u201cApparently there has been this undertow that has now bubbled to the surface.\u201d Addressing a town hall meeting in Ferguson earlier this week, Cornell Brooks, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said that police in the city must address a \u201csubculture\u201d of prejudice. \u201cSometimes that means putting more people in uniform that look like me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to increase the diversity of the department since I got here,\u201d Jackson insisted on Wednesday, pointing out that he had promoted black officers and describing his pursuit of diversity as a \u201cconstant struggle\u201d. Still, one after another, young black residents complained to the Guardian about the way they have been treated by those in positions of power in the city over recent years. Their claims against police officers in particular ranged from disrespect to \u201call-out race war\u201d. The city authorities are led by a white mayor, James Knowles. Four out of the five city councillors with profiles on the city website are white; one is black. The setup is largely a relic of an era less than two decades old, when Ferguson had a majority-white population. Then came steady de-industrialisation and the so-called \u201cwhite flight\u201d to suburbs further afield, with many of the families that left said to have done so primarily to avoid the integration of the city\u2019s schools system. Several people pointed to Art McCoy, who was appointed the superintendent of that struggling school system in 2011, as a rare example of a black man in a position of authority in the city. They said McCoy was well-respected among residents and understood students. Only 35% of students in the district pass maths tests used by the state to assess schools. 41% pass the English test. However in November last year, McCoy was pushed out of his job and placed on administrative leave, for reasons that remain unclear. Hundreds of students staged protests against the decision, and parents inundated city authorities with complaints. McCoy was replaced by Larry Larrew, the acting superintendent, who is white. Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for the city, said that an unusually high number of municipalities and legislative bodies in the region had created a cascading system of authorities that appeared disconnected from the lives of many African American families. \u201cBlack people see all these layers of white authority that do not like them, do not understand them and do not respect them,\u201d said Bynes, who is black. \u201cWhen the traffic court is in session here you will have a white judge, a white prosecutor and a line of black people waiting to pay penalties wrapping around the block. It breeds resentment and anger about their taxes.\u201d Bynes conceded that the failure of black residents to vote in local elections had perpetuated the problem. But, she said, \u201cmany are disenfranchised because they don\u2019t vote and they don\u2019t show up because they are too busy working out how they are going to eat and feed their families the next day.\u201d About 22% of Missouri\u2019s residents live below the federal poverty line. Jackson stressed on Wednesday that \u201crace relations are a top priority right now\u201d. He said officials from the department of justice would be assisting Ferguson with officer training and helping the force to \u201cfix what\u2019s wrong\u201d. But as protesters began a standoff on Tuesday night with a long line of police blocking downtown Ferguson, decked out in riot gear and backed by two armoured vehicles, many said that they weren\u2019t interested in a dialogue. A few even said that Sunday\u2019s looting and torching of a QuikTrip gas station near the scene of Brown\u2019s killing should be interpreted as an attack on all outsider-owned businesses, which would continue. \u201cWe can use this as an opportunity,\u201d one man, Charles Jolley, told a few dozen allies whose attention he held, several of whom agreed vocally. \u201cWe can reclaim our community. This is a war, and we are soldiers on the front line\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
