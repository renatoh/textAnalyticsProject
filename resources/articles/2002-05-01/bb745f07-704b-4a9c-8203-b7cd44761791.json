He will also become the first bowler to celebrate the achievement twice. It was during the final of the Asian Test Championship last month that Vaas studied a crumpled notebook in which he has recorded rough-and-ready details of his victims since his Sri Lankan debut eight years ago, and informed his team-mates in typically placid manner that the record was his. He was back in Colombo, a couple of days later, wondering why there was no bunting in the streets and no editorial proclaiming his virtues in the Daily News, when Dav Whatmore, Sri Lanka's coach, was alerted to the fact that the official statisticians had a different view. \"He told me that I was only on 196. I argued that my calculations said 200, but he said no one else thought so. I'd had handshakes all round in the dressing room and had celebrated over a quiet meal. Now I will have to strive to do it again.\" It is a story that is delightfully Sri Lankan: proud, gently humorous, and slightly at odds with the modern, technologically-driven world. For all that, Vaas is not a bowler - or man - to be underestimated. With no Muttiah Muralitharan to spearhead Sri Lanka's bowling, the 28-year-old will become both stock bowler and strike bowler, relentlessly accurate from a modest, grooved approach, given teeth by a wicked in-dipper, and with the stamina and patience to explore his opponents' weaknesses hour after hour. There may no longer be a Michael Atherton for him to pick off at will, as he did the last time these sides met, but that there will be new victims is inevitable. Six months ago Vaas pronounced himself a fast bowler, reaching his peak with a devastating exhibition of swing bowling against West Indies. At the Sinhalese Sports Club he bowled Sri Lanka to victory with seven wickets in each innings, 14 for 191 in the match. Less than a week later he bettered Murali's one-day record by taking eight for 19, including a hat-trick, as Zimbabwe were dismissed for 38. Before the game he had asked his wife Wasana what she wanted for her birthday. \"She told me to take seven wickets and come home early. So I took eight and got home even earlier.\" That is very much in the style of the man. Warnakulasuriya Patabendige Ushantha Joseph Chaminda Vaas is one of the most undemonstrative members of a mild-mannered side. These days, though, a contented marriage, baby daughter and a career at its peak give him a striking self-possession. As a young child he helped to carry the cross at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Wattala on the northern fringes of Colombo. \"I seriously considered going into the priesthood, which would have meant 12 to 14 years of study, but cricket began to take over.\" He carries a bible and a rosary on tour, goes to church, and joins a predominantly Buddhist Sri Lankan side in praying before every game. He occasionally entertains his team-mates by crooning Sinhalese love songs. When pining for home he might sing something by Chandana Liyanarachchi. \"Maybe Suwada Thiya - a man singing for his girlfriend, beautiful like a flower.\" The supportive dressing-room atmosphere developed by the coach Whatmore and captain Sanath Jayasuriya suits him. His recovery from two stress fractures has long proved his resolve, but he is now respected as a senior counsellor in the dressing room. \"His improvement has not happened by accident,\" says Whatmore. \"He does so much work that people don't see, in the gym, on the running track and the year he spent working out reverse swing, studying the videos and experimenting in the nets. He has found the key to success at this level.\" There may be more to come. \"Wasim Akram promised me in Sharjah that he will teach me everything,\" Vaas said, \"but only when he retires.\" England will find him enough of a challenge in the meantime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
