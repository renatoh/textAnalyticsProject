Woodland appears a little more pensive and trudges off with his hands in his pockets. Relaxed or downcast? Up to you. Either way, he\u2019s got plenty to think about as he goes into the final day of the US Open holding the 54-hole lead. That was a dramatic afternoon\u2019s play; if we have anything like a repeat tomorrow, when we make our way towards the business end, it\u2019s going to be a heck of a battle between Woodland and Rose. And some other big hitters, like Louis Oosthuizen, Rory McIlroy, Matt Kuchar and a certain Brooks Koepka, will want their say as well. Hope you can join us tomorrow. Nighty night! -11: Woodland -10: Rose -7: Koepka, Reavie, Oosthuizen -6: McIlroy -5: Kuchar, Hadley -4: Willett, McDowell, Rahm, Stenson, Wallace -3: An, Schauffele, Scott Woodland sends his putt a little too far out to the left, and it skims the side of the hole. He blows out hard, knowing that\u2019s a good chance spurned. Rose in fact has a ten-footer as well, and whether he\u2019s helped by a wag in the crowd yelling \u201cIt\u2019s straighter than it looks!\u201d is a question for another time. But it is straight, and in it goes! Birdie, and a 68. Woodland makes do with par for a 69. His lead has been halved today, but he\u2019s still in the box seat going into Sunday! Woodland\u2019s 106 yards from the flag. He screws a fine wedge to ten feet! A great chance for a closing birdie that\u2019d give him a round of 68. Then Rose takes a swish at his sand shot ... and out it comes, leaving a five-footer for his birdie and a round of 68. Two huge putts coming up here. Rose does indeed have a way into the green. He\u2019s 276 yards out, so out comes the fairway wood. He lashes it into the bunker guarding the front right of the green. His ball lands on the upslope, and he\u2019s got green to work with. All of which may explain why he\u2019s walking towards the green enjoying a good laugh with his caddie. Just the two players left out there: Gary Woodland and Justin Rose. Both send their tee shots at 18 towards the tree on the right, not wanting to take any chances with the rocks falling down to the Pacific on the left. Woodland ends up behind the tree, so he won\u2019t be able to launch one towards the green. He\u2019ll be laying up. Rose might have a route in, but we\u2019ll see about that for sure in a minute. Woodland draws one around the tree and he\u2019ll have a nice wedge in. Oosthuizen was going round with Aaron Wise today. The 22-year-old from Vegas had an absolute shocker: a 79 that included a quadruple-bogey eight at 9. He ends the day well down the standings at +3. Sepp Straka, who had been hovering around the top of the leader board during the first two days, also had a miserable time, shooting 76. He\u2019s +3 as well. But both young players will be better for the experience. Two putts for Woodland, and that\u2019s another par. He\u2019s still only made two bogeys all week! This is how you win US Opens. Meanwhile Rose\u2019s ball takes a little bobble as it comes off the face of his putter, and stays up on the right. And on 18, Oosthuizen lays up, then wedges in to 25 feet. But he can\u2019t guide the right-to-left curler in for birdie. Still, he makes his par, and he\u2019d have taken three under for the last four holes when he was standing on the 15th tee. He\u2019s right back in the mix! Rose caresses a lovely 6-iron straight at the flag on 17. He\u2019s ten feet away! Woodland finds the green too, but he\u2019s 35 feet away. Advantage Rose, you\u2019d have thought, but we\u2019ve been here before. Meanwhile it was a par for Chez Reavie at the last, and he signed for a marvellous 68. -11: Woodland (16) -9: Rose (16) -7: Koepka (F), Reavie (F), Oosthuizen (17) -6: McIlroy (F) -5: Kuchar (F), Hadley (F) -4: Willett (F), McDowell (F), Rahm (F), Stenson (F), Wallace (F) Rose shows his stones by getting up and down from the curly kale at the front of 17. He remains two off the lead, because Woodland fails to guide in his left-to-right breaker for birdie. Up on 18 - a hole Chesson Hadley had earlier bogeyed to finish with 70 on -5 - McIlroy arrows a stunning second from 220 yards to 20 feet. But the dream eagle\u2019s not to be, his ball breaking to the right. Still, a birdie was the minimum requirement, and he\u2019s made it. He signs for a 70, and at -6 a second US Open still isn\u2019t out of the question. But he\u2019ll most likely need the leaders to stumble. Par for Matt Kuchar down the last. He signs for a disappointing 70, having started so well. He\u2019s -5. But it\u2019s three birdies in a row for Louis Oosthuizen, who rolls in a 15-footer on 17! He\u2019s -7, having looked totally out of it an hour ago! Rose, in prime position in the centre of 16, lands his 9-iron a couple of yards short of the green. It snags in the thick stuff. Woodland spins his to 12 feet. Meanwhile on 18, McIlroy bangs a glorious drive down the middle, cutting the corner, the rocks, the Pacific Ocean, the lot. He\u2019ll be wanting birdie, dreaming of eagle. Woodland and Rose both hit safe irons down 16. Neither particularly long, but safety first. Henrik Stenson and Jon Rahm both finished with one-under 70s, by the way. They\u2019re -4, not totally out of it, but requiring both Woodland and Rose to lose their nerve spectacularly, at which point they can take their chances with the remainder of the field. -11: Woodland (15) -9: Rose (15) -7: Koepka (F), Reavie (17) -6: Hadley (17), Oosthuizen (16) -5: Kuchar (17), McIlroy (17) -4: Willett (F), McDowell (F), Rahm (F), Stenson (F), Wallace (F) Rose is just short of the 15th in two. His putt up is not Woodlandesque, kinking five feet to the left. But he holds his nerve to tidy up. His partner, the leader Woodland, has a great chance to extend his advantage at the top, but doesn\u2019t commit to a ten-footer for birdie and so par will have to do. Up on 17, McIlroy finds sand with his 7-iron, and hits his escape a little bit thin. He\u2019ll need to sink a 25-footer coming back for his par. He can\u2019t make it. He slips back to -5, where he started the day. So much for moving. What he\u2019d give for Matt Wallace\u2019s finish. Par for Reavie, though, and he remains in a tie for third at -7. Matt Wallace has struggled all day. But he drains a 35-foot eagle putt across 18, and suddenly a poor round has turned into an acceptable level-par 71. He\u2019s -4 going into Sunday. Meanwhile his playing partner Koepka takes two putts for his par, and that\u2019s a 68 to go with two 69s for the defending champ. He\u2019s -7. Back-to-back birdies for Louis Oosthuizen, at 15 and 16. He\u2019s salvaging his US Open bid at the end of his round. He\u2019s -6. But bother for Matt Kuchar on 17. He fluffs a chip and can\u2019t guide home a putt from the fringe. He slips to -5. And on 18, Koepka accepts the situation and quickly knocks a chip into the heart of the green but 40 feet from the flag, about the best he could do. This is going to be interesting for Brooks Koepka. The champ sends his drive at 18 towards the tree on the right. He\u2019s up close, but there\u2019s enough room for a full swing, and a route under the branches to the green. He opts to go for it ... and slices it to the right. He\u2019s short of the green, and it\u2019s not a great leave, because there\u2019s a bunker in the road, and branches of another tree overhanging it, so a simple chip is out of the question. Rose then knocks in his birdie putt from the fringe at the back! It\u2019s pretty much a replay of what happened at 12 in terms of narrative and dramatic rhythm. This is rollicking good fun, with both Woodland and Rose giving as good as they\u2019re getting, scrambling when they must, making the big birdies when they can. And it\u2019s only Saturday! Goodness know what tomorrow is going to bring. -11: Woodland (14) -9: Rose (14) -7: Koepka (17), Reavie (16) Woodland gets a huge break with his chip into the 14th. He seriously underhits it, but somehow the ball doesn\u2019t topple back off the false front. Had it done so, he\u2019d have been back on the fairway, snookered by the bunker like McIlroy was earlier. But his ball stays stubbornly stuck on the green. And then he drains the 40-footer for his par save! This is astonishing! Look at this one of two ways: this is simply going to be Woodland\u2019s year, because his short game and steely nerve are the business! The other is that his tee-to-green game is beginning to fray, and there\u2019s only so often you can chip in or drain monster putts. Take your pick. A how-did-that-stay-out moment on 17. A gorgeous tee shot by Koepka, pin high to 25 feet. He hits what looks like a perfect birdie putt, but it somehow lips out on the left while travelling at glacial speed. That really should have dropped. Gravity has done a number on Koepka there. He stays at -7. Real bother for Woodland at 14. His drive didn\u2019t finish in the bunker, but awfully tangled rough just beside. The grass turns his club over as he takes his second shot, and the ball disappears into awful stuff on the other side of the fairway. He\u2019s forced to hack out, and will need an up-and-down from 50 yards for his par. Meanwhile Rose is just off the back in three, close enough to the flag, on the fringe. And Kuchar hands back the shot he picked up at 15 within one hole. He\u2019s -6. Adam Scott has suffered since the turn, with bogeys at 11, 12 and 14. But he\u2019s just holed out from sand at the par-three 17th. He\u2019s -2. Some other admin: Francesco Molinari in with a level-par 71; he\u2019s -2. Xander Schauffele finished with a 71 as well; he\u2019s -3. Sergio limped home in par since we last heard from him, and that\u2019s a dismal 75; he\u2019s +1. And it was a 73 for Jordan Spieth; news of his recovery a little premature perhaps, and he\u2019s +1 too. ... something finally happens for Rory McIlroy! He sends his second shot at 15 from 160 yards to 12 feet, and rolls in the putt! The birdie takes him to within five of Woodland\u2019s lead ... and both Woodland and Rose have found sand with their tee shots at the par-five 13th. McIlroy permits himself a low-key air-punch in celebration. -11: Woodland (13) -8: Rose (13) -7: Koepka (16), Kuchar (15), Reavie (15) -6: McIlroy (15) G-Mac holes a monster across 18 for eagle! That means it\u2019s a round of 70 for the 2010 champion, and he\u2019s -4 going into the final day. Koepka is pin high at 16 in two. He\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 15 feet. But he can\u2019t make it. Birdie for Matt Kuchar at 15; he\u2019s -7. Woodland clips his chip from the front-left of the 13th to four feet, and tidies up for par. And he\u2019s got a three-stroke lead again, because Rose twitches over a five-footer and it\u2019s a miserable bogey. Before Woodland chipped in on 12, Rose was dreaming of getting to within one. Now all of a sudden he\u2019s three behind again. Leader board coming up next, because ... Woodland\u2019s tee shot at 13 finds the tangled nonsense down the right. His second squirts left, and nearly ends up in the bunker guarding the green, but stops just short. It\u2019s in the rough, but sitting up. Rose meanwhile is short of the green in two, but on the fairway. This US Open is turning into a bit of a grind now ... and it\u2019s wonderful entertainment! Compare and contrast. After the wonder chips by Woodland and Koepka, McIlroy - in the bunker to the right of the 14th green in two - hits a fat splash. His ball only just gets out of the sand, then curls all the way back off the false front of the green, and now he\u2019s faced with a big up-and-down to stay at -5. Which he does, nearly chipping in himself for birdie, but there\u2019s to be no celebration for McIlroy. That\u2019s a really poor way to pass on a good chance for birdie, despite the fact he nearly salvaged it with his wedge. Woodland chips in! A cute little clack of the wedge, and his ball serenely rolls along a right-to-left route and into the cup! What a par save! And suddenly Rose\u2019s nine-foot putt looks twice as long! He makes it, though, refusing to allow Woodland\u2019s escape affect him. A broad smile, and he\u2019s closed the gap at the top! But if Woodland\u2019s par isn\u2019t ludicrous enough, up on 15 Koepka trundles his chip across the green and into the cup to stay at -7! Difficult to say who\u2019s happier of the three, though Rose is the one who\u2019s made material gain. -11: Woodland (12) -9: Rose (12) -7: Koepka (15), Reavie (13) -6: Kuchar (14) Woodland\u2019s in a hell of a bind. His ball is plugged in the face of the bunker, but not in the sand. He\u2019s forced to stand three feet below in the trap, grip down, and stab his ball out sideways. And he slightly overcooks it, his ball squirting into the rough on the other side of the green. And there\u2019s similar trouble for the champ Koepka on 15, as his wedge out of the awful rough to the side of the green flies through the dancefloor and into more cabbage. Meanwhile eagle-eyed readers will have noticed that Koepka didn\u2019t make birdie at the par-five 14th after his blootered drive. Having laid up with his second, he wedged to 15 feet but didn\u2019t make the putt. And now he\u2019s just pulled his approach into deep filth to the left of the 15th green. There could be some change afoot at the top soon. Woodland\u2019s tee shot at 12 snags the thick stuff surrounding the bunker at the front of the green. Rose responds by whipping a 5-iron into the front-right portion of the green ... and he gets a very fortunate bounce, as the ball leaps forward and lands on a slope that gathers his ball towards the hole. He\u2019ll have a great look at birdie from ten feet, while his partner has some trouble to be dealing with. Reavie rolls in a putt from off the front of 13! That\u2019s back-to-back birdies. That was a perfect read. Reavie, from Wichita, a lineman. He\u2019s -7. But he\u2019s still four off the lead, because Woodland taps in from three feet for birdie at 11. Rose couldn\u2019t guide in a seven-foot curler for his birdie, and there\u2019s significant separation at the top again. -11: Woodland (11) -8: Rose (11) -7: Koepka (14), Reavie (13) Speaking of Spanish capitulations, Jon Rahm bogeyed 10, 11 and 13, and all looked lost. But he\u2019s just carded back-to-back birdies at 14 and 15, and he\u2019s level par for an, ahem, adventurous round. At -3 he\u2019s a little too far back you\u2019d have thought, unless both Woodland and Rose unravel. But both have gone close at 11, Woodland especially, so Rahm shouldn\u2019t hold his breath. A slightly disappointing 72 for Matt Fitzpatrick. The young Sheffield star posted a couple of early birdies, but suffered mid-round, with bogeys at 8, 9, 10 and 13. A birdie at 14 salvaged his score a little, and despite it all he\u2019s still in red figures at the US Open, a state of affairs that should never be sniffed at. Meanwhile you might be wondering why I\u2019ve been ignoring Sergio today. Bogeys at 1, 4, 5, 8 and 9 are why I\u2019ve been doing that. He\u2019s since picked up one shot at 13, but through 16 holes he\u2019s four over for his round and +1. Ah well, at least he made his first cut at a major since 2017. Oh Sergio! Chez Reavie makes a 15-footer on 12 for birdie. He\u2019s ticking along without fuss, and is only four off the lead at -6. Another par for McIlroy who remains at -5. Oosthuizen can\u2019t get up and down from sand at 11 and slips to -4. A drama-free par for Woodland at 10. And Rose makes his 30th one-putt of the week, scrambling par to stay within two of his playing partner. -10: Woodland (10) -8: Rose (10) -7: Koepka (13) -6: Kuchar (12), Hadley (12), Reavie (12) -5: McIlroy (12) -4: Willett (F), Stenson (14), Oosthuizen (11) Dustin Johnson is in with a level-par 71. Pebble Beach isn\u2019t going to pay him back for the carnage of 2010. He\u2019s -2, having moved not a jot today. Meanwhile Brooks Koepka, having made his way through perhaps the hardest stretch at Pebble Beach without a misstep, opens his shoulders on the par-five 14th and clatters a monster drive down the track. McIlroy is in danger of dropping a stroke at 11, finding himself snagged on a bank to the right of the green. He can\u2019t get particularly close with his bump down. But he rolls in the seven footer coming back to save his par. Nothing\u2019s happening today for the 2011 winner at all, but there are always patches like this, there\u2019s a long way to go, and at least he\u2019s hanging in there. Brandon Wu is in with his second 71 of the week. Filed alongside yesterday\u2019s wonderful 69, the 22-year-old Californian is leading the race for low amateur. At -2, he\u2019s a couple of shots ahead of Viktor Hovland, who you\u2019ll remember getting as high as -4 on Thursday. A further two shots back, it\u2019s Chandler Eaton at +2. And it\u2019s safe to say Michael Thorbjornsen is out of contention after an unfortunate 84 today; he\u2019s +15. But at 17, he\u2019ll just be thrilled to have made it to the weekend. Plenty of big-name pros didn\u2019t. One of the shots of the day by Chesson Hadley, who fires his approach at 11 over the flag, landing his ball at the back of the green and spinning it 30 feet back to seven feet. But he can\u2019t reward himself by converting the birdie chance. He stays at -6. Rose meanwhile remains at -8 after doing extremely well to get up and down from a tight lie to the left of the green. He does pretty well to get within eight feet, then pokes in a right-to-left curler to scramble his par. Woodland makes a fairly fuss-free par. Koepka opts to putt, and lags a long one from 60 to three feet. That\u2019s a great save. The champion is three under for his round today, the best of anyone in the top ten bar the long-finished Danny Willett - who had been playing in slightly more favourable conditions. That could prove a significant trend. He stays at -7. McIlroy lets another 15-foot birdie putt dribble by, this time at 10. Shades of DJ yesterday, who let so many chances slide. Rory remains at -5. He looks dejected, but he\u2019s still only five off the lead, and there\u2019s still so much golf to play. Meanwhile Koepka hits a 6-iron into the par-three 12th, but either it gets caught up in the wind (which is picking up a little bit, albeit in unpredictable spasms) or he\u2019s under-clubbed. Whatever, he\u2019s short of the green and looking totally radged off as a result. Woodland drops his first shot since the 9th hole on Thursday. Only his second bogey of the week. He totally misreads his putt from the fringe at the back of 8, sending it miles to the right, expecting a right-angle snap when it was more of a gentle slider. That leaves him with a tricky six-footer across the green, and he can\u2019t save himself. Meanwhile in true match-play fashion, Rose strokes his birdie putt straight into the cup. And suddenly a four-shot lead is only two! It\u2019ll be fascinating to see how Woodland responds to his first setback for 48 hours. -10: Woodland (8) -8: Rose (8) -7: Koepka (11) -6: Kuchar (10), Hadley (10) -5: Reavie (9), McIlroy (9), Oosthuizen (8) -4: Willett (F), Stenson (12) A wild tee shot by Koepka on 11. But his power enables him to force his ball greenwards, when most would leave it well short. He\u2019s inches off the back, and cradles a putt from the fringe to tap-in distance. What an escape! He stays at -7. \u201cI suspect you\u2019re right, Scott,\u201d is the perfect start to email correspondence, as employed here by Simon McMahon. \u201cMickelson is fated never to win the US Open. Being about as far from an elite sportsman as it\u2019s possible to be, I\u2019ve no great insight into this, but I imagine he won\u2019t give it up easily, a bit like Jimmy White still thinks he can win the World Snooker Championship cos he made a century in practice, or Dundee United think they\u2019ll win Big Cup cos they beat Arbroath in a pre-season friendly. Sport really is a metaphor for life, or vice versa, or something, eh?\u201d Probably more for us than him. After all, he\u2019s got the Masters, the Open and the PGA in the bag. And if missing out on a US Open is good enough for Sam Snead, it should be good enough for Lefty. Chez Reavie makes a sensational par save on 9, curling in a downhill right-to-left putt from 30 feet. He stays at -5. Par for McIlroy, a 15-foot birdie effort sliding by on the low side. He turns in level-par 35. Back on 8, Rose arrows his own shot of the day, a 5-iron straight at the flag. He\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 15 feet on this exceptionally difficult hole. Woodland\u2019s second, a 7-iron pushed a little to the right, takes a lucky bounce off the hood of a bunker and kicks towards the green. He\u2019ll have two putts from the fringe at the back for par - but that could have gone anywhere. Sand and a penalty area to the right. A garden-variety par for Woodland on 7. Rose leaves himself a testing par saver from five feet, having raced a 40-foot birdie effort by. He can\u2019t miss this one coming back, for the sake of his confidence more than anything else. And he doesn\u2019t. No three-putts for Rose this week. Meanwhile Oosthuizen drops back to -5, having found that tricky bank by the side of 8. And on 9, Kuchar yips a tiddler for par and sends the ball four feet past! Oh dear. He does very well to gather himself and knock the one coming back in for bogey. But that\u2019s two shots gone in two holes. Meanwhile Gary Woodland clatters a fine tee shot down 8, but there\u2019s an ominous rumble coming from behind ... it\u2019s Brooks Koepka, who birdies 10 after stroking his second to eight feet, and moves into a share of second spot! -11: Woodland (7) -7: Koepka (10), Rose (7) -6: Kuchar (9), Hadley (9) Gary Woodland gets up and down from a greenside bunker at the par-five 6th, and he\u2019s extended his lead to four. We\u2019re getting to the point where the chasing pack need him to slip up and offer them some hope ... but he\u2019s only dropped one stroke this week! Justin Rose meanwhile has to make do with par after his approach finds an awful lie to the right of the dancefloor. Meanwhile Chez Reavie sends his second into the tousled bank to the left of 8, and the result is a shot dropped. He\u2019s back to -5. -11: Woodland (6) -7: Kuchar (8), Rose (6) -6: Koepka (9), Hadley (8), Oosthuizen (7) -5: Reavie (8), McIlroy (8) Wallace can only bash his ball into the heart of 9. He\u2019s 30 feet past the flag, though. Two putts, but that\u2019s a double bogey. He\u2019s out in 38, having clattered down the standings to -1. But a no-fuss par for his partner Koepka, who reaches the turn in a blemish-free 33. He\u2019s -6. Par for McIlroy at 8: he stays at -5. And Phil Mickelson ends his round with a triple-bogey eight. It\u2019s a 75, he\u2019s +3, and the career slam\u2019s just not going to happen, is it. Matt Wallace\u2019s round is threatening to unravel. Having bogeyed 8, he\u2019s only one over today. But his tee shot at 9 finds thick oomska down the left, and his attempt to gouge out flies straight left, and he\u2019s in even worse trouble now. He pinches the bridge of his nose in an attempt to keep calm. He\u2019s currently -3 but won\u2019t stay there long. Meanwhile Jon Rahm nearly extricates himself from trouble at 10, chipping from a tight spot on the right to ten feet. But he shoves the par saver and slips back to -4. Matt Kuchar does very well to bundle his ball from the thick grass to a couple of feet. He\u2019ll escape with just a bogey. But that means Gary Woodland now has a three-stroke lead ... and he\u2019s just cracked a fine driving iron down the par-five 6th. He\u2019s looking calm and composed today. Meanwhile back-to-back birdies for Xander Schauffele, at 10 and 11, have brought the 25-year-old Californian back into this tournament. And the 2016 Open champ Henrik Stenson isn\u2019t out of this, reaching the turn in 34. -10: Woodland (5) -7: Kuchar (7), Rose (5) -6: Koepka (8), Hadley (7), Reavie (7), Oosthuizen (6) -5: Rahm (9), McIlroy (7) -4: Willett (F), Furyk (12), Schauffele (11), Stenson (9), Wise (6) Kuchar sends his second at the troublesome 8 high onto the bank to the left of the green. He\u2019s facing an almost impossible chip down, and sure enough it flies through the green and into thick stuff on the other side. He\u2019d take a bogey now and run. Meanwhile birdie for Oosthuizen at 6, and he\u2019s back to -6. In attempting to gently splash out of the bunker, Rose suffers a full-blown shank. Off the hosel. The ball squirts to the right and snags in the rough stuff just over the bunker. He nips his third shot close, but that\u2019ll be a bogey. Woodland manages to splash out to ten feet, and makes the saver to remain at -10. Meanwhile Chez Reavie - after decent finishes at the last two PGAs - makes birdie at 6 and 7 to rise to -6. Rose is having to fight his game tee to green. He shoves his tee shot at the par-three 5th into the bunker on the right. He\u2019s going to be short-sided from there. And Woodland follows him in! Trouble for the pair there. Before Woodland can tidy up for his birdie, his partner Rose gets up and down from greenside sand. So the final group both pick up a shot. Quite a few of the leading pack making hay over the first seven holes, where the scorin\u2019 is good. -10: Woodland (4) -8: Kuchar (7), Rose (4) -6: Koepka (7), Hadley (7) -5: Rahm (8), Reavie (6), McIlroy (6), Oosthuizen (5) Woodland looks to be in a little trouble on 4, his perfect tee shot having found a massive divot. His wedge in will surely be difficult to control. But he somehow slams the brakes on right by the flag, and he\u2019ll surely be converting that for his first birdie of the day. Meanwhile birdie for McIlroy at 6, and he\u2019s back where he started the day at -5. And another birdie for Matt Kuchar, this time at 7, and folk are finally starting to make their moves on Moving Day! Thanks to Rob. Back just in time for some top eagle action. Matt Kuchar and Chesson Hadley have just played the par-five 6th in a combined total of six strokes. Two stunning second shots, two eagles! Kuchar\u2019s presence here is no surprise; he\u2019s so often involved at the business end of the majors. But Hadley, a 31-year-old from North Carolina, has no track record in the majors whatsoever. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s missed six of his last seven cuts! Meanwhile it\u2019s back-to-back birdies for Brooks Koepka, who follows up 6 with a 20-footer at 7. All told, the top of the leader board suddenly looks a whole lot different. -9: Woodland (3) -7: Kuchar (6), Rose (3) -6: Koepka (7), Hadley (6) -5: Rahm (8), Oosthuizen (5) The Americans are coming; Jim Furyk and Matt Kuchar to be precise. A birdie for Furyk at the ninth gets him t0 -4, two under on the day, while Kuchar is now at -5 after gaining a shot at the 4th. He\u2019s joint fourth, with the menacing Koepka, who has just birdied 6 and is beginning to relish these grimy conditions. Tiger finishes with a birdie at 18 for a 71 and he will go into the final round at level par. And with that I\u2019ll return you to the comforting arms of Scott Murray. Thanks for your time. Bye. Woods produces some magic on 16 to grab a birdie from a long way away on the green. The putt is sensational but it\u2019s all been a bit of a mess today. That\u2019s his fourth birdie but five bogeys have checked his progress and are stymying any continuation of his fairytale comeback. For now. He\u2019s +1 , but he\u2019s TIger. Danny Willett is in the bunker on 18. It\u2019s not an awful position though, or lie for that matter, and he produces a fine sand wedge to leave himself a short putt for par. He rolls that in without drama and that is a 67 for the Englishman and the round of the day. He\u2019s the clubhouse leader on -4 and remarkably is currently in a tie for fifth. Well played that man. And immediately he\u2019s giving an interview \u2026 It was really good. I got off to a hot start and came in really strong down the last few. It\u2019s pretty windy out there but you\u2019ve got to get out quick, hang on through the middle and come home strong. Them leaders would probably bite you hand off for level par or -1 with the position they\u2019re in. If someone is double figures under par at the end of the day I think they\u2019ll be leading Gary Woodland and Justin Rose are on the first tee, and they\u2019ll be pleased nobody has jumped out of the pack at them so far. Rose drifts his iron into the rough on the right. Woodland, who has only made one bogey in this tournament so far, follows him in there. Up on the 1st green Oosthuizen holes a long one to save par while McIlroy misses his birdie putt to the right on 2. Thanks as always Scott. Things are looking tough out there but Mickelson is a fighter and snares a fine birdie two at 12 to return to -2. That was on the back of a bogey at 11 for the big man who keeps on coming, whatever the course throws at him. Koepka passes up a birdie chance at 3 but rattles in the par saver to suggest he\u2019s in the mood to move. Rory punches his third into the green, but from that position there\u2019s no control, and his ball dribbles off the back of the putting surface. He\u2019s left with a 40-footer from the fringe for his par. Bogey is the realistic target now, of course, and he does pretty well to pop a putt, the even longer grass hampering his back-stroke, to six feet. But he really needs that bogey putt to go in. It does. He\u2019s -4. Meanwhile Mickelson creams a tee shot at the par-three 12th to 12 inches. He\u2019ll be back to -2 unless he has one of his infamous rushes of blood from close range. And with that, I\u2019m taking a break. Rob Bleaney will look after you, and I\u2019ll see you again soon. McIlroy is making a mess of this opening hole. He gouges out of the rough on the right ... and sends his ball into the equally thick rubbish down the other side. He\u2019ll have fancied a quick start, but this is no good. Meanwhile birdie for Tiger at 14, after he nearly holed out for eagle with his wedge; he\u2019s +1. Koepka curls in his par saver! That is quite absurd given the trouble he found off the tee. He stays at -4. But his partner Matt Wallace can\u2019t perform a similar feat of escapology after a loose tee shot, and he\u2019s -3. Meanwhile a bogey for Mickelson at 11; he slips back to -1. And Rory\u2019s out and about, but he\u2019s already in bother, pushing his iron off the 1st tee into the rough down the right. Trouble for the defending champ on 2. Koepka sprays his drive into thick stuff down the right. That ball disappeared. This is going to be interesting, on a monster par four. He gouges out, then sends a wedge biting 15 feet past the flag. He\u2019ll have a putt with a lot of movement for par. Not ideal, but after that drive, to even have a chance of saving par has been some effort. Meanwhile par for Fitzpatrick on 3, though he nearly drained a 40-footer for birdie from the back of the green. Willett goes close to another birdie at 15, but his effort from 20 feet shaves the lip. Birdie for Jon Rahm at 3, though, to cancel out a dropped shot at 2. He\u2019s -3. Xander Schauffele has been erratic over the opening four holes, to say the least. After that aforementioned double at 1, he dropped another at 2, then birdied 3. Finally he\u2019s threaded his drive at 4 through the small entrance to the green, nearly hitting the flagstick. Had that happened, we could have had a hole-in-one albatross on our hands! But the ball scampered past, towards the back of the green. Two putts later, and that\u2019s another birdie. He\u2019s one over for his round today, but at -2 overall, at least on the way back. A little frustration for Brooks Koepka, too. He strokes his second at 1 to 15 feet, but his straight uphill birdie putt stops one dimple short of an opening birdie. And apologies, but there was some misinformation flying around regarding Fitzpatrick\u2019s shot into the par-five 6th. It was his third, not his second, after a poor tee shot. So the 20-footer was for birdie, not eagle. And he didn\u2019t make it. So he stays at -4. Bah. It hurt me just as much as it hurt you. News of Rickie Fowler, who is in with a disappointing 71. He was three under for his round after 7, then was an inch away from holing out from sand at 8, but that near miss took the wind out of his sail. Bogeys at 9, 10 and 15 knocked him back to +1, and the frown that accompanied a near miss for birdie at the last tells the story. His major-championship frustration continues. DJ bounces back with birdie at the par-five 6th. He\u2019ll be slightly disappointed, nonetheless, having lashed his second from 225 yards to 15 feet. But he doesn\u2019t quite hit his eagle putt, which dies off to the right at the last. He\u2019s -4. Birdie for Danny Willett at 14, and he\u2019s -3 again, having weathered his mid-round storm. And coming behind Dustin is Matt Fitzpatrick, who clacks a gorgeous fairway wood into the green like the big man before him. He\u2019ll have a look at an eagle putt from about 20 feet that\u2019d take him to within three of the lead! Bogey for Tiger at 12. He\u2019s +2, his race is run, if it wasn\u2019t already, long ago. Meanwhile Nate Lashley is going along nicely, following up birdie at 1 with another at 6. The 36-year-old debutant - whose tragic backstory is briefly told here - is -3 overall. Meanwhile on the first tee, it\u2019s Brooks Koepka, who whips his opening iron down the fairway. He\u2019ll be going round today with Matt Wallace, the young English prospect\u2019s chops up after tie for third at Bethpage Black last month. Back-to-back birdies for Francesco Molinari! He follows up one at 3 by nearly backspinning a wedge from 100 yards into the cup at 4. He rises to -4 for the tournament. He\u2019ll be ruing that double-bogey/bogey finish at 8 and 9 yesterday, though the amount of absurd par saves he made earlier in the round may ensure he stays philosophical about the whole enterprise. Matt Fitzpatrick joins him at -4 by going extremely close with his tee shot at the par-three 5th, knocking in a short putt for his second birdie of the day. But DJ\u2019s going the other way, after finding the bunker to the right of 5. He\u2019s -3 again. -9: Woodland -7: Rose -6: Oosthuizen -5: Wise, McIlroy -4: Fitzpatrick (5), Molinari (4), Reavie, Hadley, Kuchar, Koepka, Wallace You have got to love Patrick Reed. He\u2019s totally unrepentant for his club-snapping antics of yesterday. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to the golf course, I didn\u2019t say obscenities or anything like that. It was a split second, I moved on and did my business, hit my next golf shot.\u201d Ewan Murray reports. The wind\u2019s up a little today and, surprise surprise, the links are playing much tougher. Nobody\u2019s made a charge towards the top of the leaderboar... er, hold on! Here comes the big man! Dustin follows up his birdie at 3 by wedging from 70 yards at the short par-four to seven feet, then rolling in the putt. He\u2019s -4! If his putter is hot today, we could be in for something special, because the rest of his game looked in super nick yesterday. Imagine if he managed to lift the famous old trophy tomorrow, a fairytale end to his 2010 nightmare. There wouldn\u2019t be a dry eye in the house. -9: Woodland -7: Rose -6: Oosthuizen -5: Wise, McIlroy -4: D Johnson (4), Reavie, Hadley, Kuchar, Koepka, Wallace Xander Schauffele looks like a major champion in waiting. The 25-year-old from San Diego has only made nine previous starts in the majors, but already has second-placed finishes at the Open and the Masters to his name, plus fifth and sixth-placed finishes at his two US Open appearances. He\u2019s got the game for the big occasion. But this one might be beyond him. All looked fine and dandy after his opening round of 66, but yesterday\u2019s 73 was a slog, and he\u2019s opened up today by careering down the 1st like the Keystone Kops. A double-bogey after visiting the rough on both sides of the hole, plus a greenside bunker, and he\u2019s crashed down to +1. Here\u2019s a little upwardly mobile action, though. Birdie for the 2016 champ Dustin Johnson, who rattles in a 20-footer at 3. He\u2019s -3, and really should be a few shots better off, because he played very well yesterday tee to green, but his flat stick did a number on him coming home. I lost count of the short birdie putts he missed. He\u2019s only six behind, and if the big man can get something going ... well, he may feel Pebble Beach owes him big-style after his notorious Sunday meltdown in 2010. And a birdie for Lefty at 6, the first splash of red colour on his card today. He\u2019s -2. It all goes wrong quicksmart for Hideki Matsuyama. He finds deep rough down the left of 11, then more thick stuff on the other side of the track. Throw in a missed short putt, and that\u2019s a double bogey that sends him crashing down to -1. Only one of the early starters has got as high as -4, and Danny Willett couldn\u2019t stay there. The leading pack will be satisfied with the way this is panning out. Tiger pulls a straight 15-foot birdie putt to the left of the cup at 9. He swishes his putter through the air in great irritation. He tidies up for par, and he\u2019s turning in 36. He\u2019s +1 for his round and the tournament. Meanwhile birdie for Matt Fitzpatrick at 2, and the young Englishman is -3. A nice run by Paul Casey! The 41-year-old Englishman bogeyed 2 and 3, but he\u2019s responded with birdies at 4, 6 and now 7, the latest the reward for a monster putt from the back of the green, An Byeong-hun territory. He\u2019s -1. Meanwhile Hideki Matsuyama repairs the damage of bogey at 9 with birdie at 10 to return to -3. But Danny Willett can\u2019t repeat the trick. Another wild tee shot, and after hacking his way up the left of the 10th, it\u2019s back-to-back bogeys. There goes that momentum! He slips back to -2. Patrick Cantlay was the hipster-tipster\u2019s choice this week. No wonder: he\u2019d just won the Memorial Tournament at Muirfield Village, a victory that came off the back of a top-ten finish at the Masters and a tie for third at last month\u2019s PGA. An opening-day 73 meant he was off the pace from the get-go, and yesterday\u2019s 71 didn\u2019t really address that. The 27-year-old Californian only just made the cut. But he\u2019s finally made a significant move up the leader board today. A fine 68, after coming home with birdies at 13, 16 and 17, have taken him to -1 for the tournament. That\u2019s the round of the day so far. He\u2019s just outside the top 30 right now, but with the wind picking up a little, and the greens likely to get a touch harder as a result, he might find himself in a better position come the end of the day. Nothing\u2019s happening for Phil Mickelson. He\u2019s parred the first five holes, having left most of his birdie attempts well short. The putter not his friend today. He remains at -1. Tiger meanwhile stays +1 after par at 8. He had a good run at a 20-foot birdie putt, but it didn\u2019t drop and right now he\u2019s a study in frustration. Bogey for Matsuyama at 9, and he reaches the turn in 33. He\u2019s -2. Then coming behind, Willett drops his first stroke of the day, the result of sending his tee shot into the second cut down the left. He gives himself a chance to escape with par, clipping his third to 15 feet, but he can\u2019t make the putt. Bogey, but he\u2019s turned round in 32, a figure he\u2019d have grasped with both hands when teeing it up at 1. Tiger\u2019s left with a 40-footer down the 7th green. He nearly makes it, of course. Then his three-footer for par horseshoes out. Oh dear. A rush of blood there, hit far too hard. That\u2019s the easiest stretch of the course finished with, and he\u2019s gone backwards. He\u2019s +1, and the title\u2019s pipe-dream territory now. His partner An Byeong-hun shows the way to go, following up birdie at 6 with another at 7, thanks to a tramliner from the back of the green. He\u2019s -2. Tiger\u2019s just off the front of the par-five 6th in two. This would be a good time to do something outrageous. He opts for putter instead of wedge, and leaves his 60-footer a good seven feet short. It costs him, because he shoves his birdie putt wide right, and that\u2019s a great opportunity to move into red figures spurned. He very nearly flies the green at the 98-yard 7th, too, so it looks like another chance to pick up a stroke has gone. Willett however gets up and down magnificently from the bank to the side of 8, and keeps his card blemish-free. He stays at -4. A chance for Matsuyama to join Willett at -4. He swishes a fine second across the cliffs and into the treacherous 8th green. He\u2019s left himself a ten-foot putt for birdie ... but he can\u2019t nail it. He remains at -3. Mind you, how long Willett, in the group behind, stays at -4 is a good question, because he\u2019s tugged a 6-iron from the centre of the 8th fairway to the really thick stuff to the left of the green. His ball\u2019s disappeared into that nonsense. And it\u2019s a downhill lie. Good luck Danny! Danny Willett is flying! He clips his tee shot at the teeny-tiny 7th - playing at just 98 yards today - to 12 feet. The downhill putt he\u2019s left with is a gentle right-to-left slider, but he judges it perfectly and he\u2019s -4 now. Worthy of today\u2019s first updated leader board, I\u2019m arguing. -9: Woodland -7: Rose -6: Oosthuizen -5: Wise, McIlroy -4: Willett (7), Reavie, Hadley, Kuchar, Koepka, Wallace And another birdie for Tiger! He sends his tee shot into the centre of the par-three 5th. A straight uphill putt from 25 feet is always dropping, on an inevitable journey from the second it left the face of his flat stick. He\u2019s repaired the damage of the first three holes in short order. He\u2019s back to level par. Another birdie for Danny Willett, who creamed a fairway wood into the front of the par-five 6th, the ball breaking right towards the hole and stopping 20 feet short. His eagle putt shaved the right of the cup; he\u2019s -3 for both his round and the tournament. He\u2019s going round with his pal and compatriot Luke Donald; the former number one sees his eagle effort, set up after a similarly lovely fairway wood sent scampering into the green, stop one dimple short. Donald\u2019s +1, slowly piecing his career back together after injury. Three birdies in a row for Hideki Matsuyama, at 4, 5 and 6. The Japanese superstar, still chasing that elusive major, having tied for second a couple of years ago at Erin Hills, is -3. Tiger meanwhile chips close at 4, and tidies up from five feet for a desperately needed birdie. He\u2019s back to +1. A closing bogey for Tyrrell Hatton, the result of a wayward drive into sand down the right. He signs for a 69. He was rubbing his wrist gingerly after blasting out of that fairway bunker. Hopefully nothing serious, as at level par for the tournament, he\u2019s nicely placed for a very respectable finish tomorrow. He\u2019d been going round with one of the pre-tournament hot tips, Tommy Fleetwood, but Southport\u2019s finest has never really got going this week. A 73, to go with his 71-73 weekday work. He\u2019s +4. It\u2019s all going badly wrong for Tiger. He finds greenside sand at 3, and is forced to play away from the pin, such is his awkward position. He splashes to the heart of the green, then races his long, long, long par putt five feet past. He makes the one coming back, but that\u2019s two bogeys in the first three holes, a start he could barely afford. He\u2019s +2. As for America\u2019s other romantic choices? Rickie Fowler drops his first shot of the day at 9, though he still turns in 33; he\u2019s -1. And career-slam-chasing Phil Mickelson, from the centre of the fairway at 1, allows his approach to topple back off the front of the green. He\u2019s left with a 40-foot putt. He leaves it a couple of turns short, but will at least escape with par, remaining at -1. The post-Augusta comedown suffered by the 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett has been well documented, so there\u2019s no need to go into all that again here. But he\u2019s slowly making his way back. A win in Dubai last November, and this could be his best showing in a major since, well, you know. Birdies at 1 and 3, and he seems to be carrying himself with a little more confidence this week. It\u2019s lovely to see. And at -2, he\u2019s currently inside the top 20. Here\u2019s to the 31-year-old from Sheffield keeping it going. Rory Sabbatini is having quite the spectacular week. On Thursday, he became the first representative of Slovakia to make a hole-in-one in major-championship golf, acing the 12th. He\u2019s also got his eye in today. Having just hold a big curling putt from the fringe at 4, he rolls in a chip from distance across 5. Back-to-back birdies, and he\u2019s level par. Meanwhile news of the aforementioned Rhys Enoch: he\u2019s in with a third-round 71, and is, for what this is worth at this super-early stage, the clubhouse leader at +2. Tiger thinks the jig is up? No, no, he\u2019s not hard-wired like that, is he. From the centre of the 2nd fairway, he sends a long iron into the green, using the bank on the right to send his ball rolling left towards the cup. That\u2019s gorgeous. He\u2019ll be left with a ten-footer for bounce-back birdie. But he leaves the putt high on the right. Off he storms in the frustrated style. Meanwhile Rickie Fowler has clearly come out with an all-guns-blazing attitude. He\u2019s so unlucky not to hole out from the bunker to the right of the 8th green, his ball smacking the pin and stubbornly staying on the lip. Still, he\u2019ll tap in for par, and he remains at -2. \u201c$&amp;*!\u201d Tiger performs one of the curse words in the style of Brian Blessed on the 1st green. A baritone boom that rings around Pebble Beach, his reaction to a dropped shot on the opening hole. He\u2019d failed to give his chip in enough oomph, and the remaining putt was always a big ask. He slips to +1, and is now ten behind with 35 holes left to play. A suggestion that he knows the jig is now up, if it wasn\u2019t already. Meanwhile Hatton is this close to chipping in from sand at 17. He\u2019ll save his par. The 27-year-old from High Wycombe seems to enjoy the grind of a US Open. Another birdie for Tyrrell Hatton! He\u2019s going along very nicely today. Birdies at 3, 6, 7 and now 15, offset by a single bogey at 5. Three under for his round and -1 overall. Easy to forget that Hatton tied for sixth last year at Shinnecock Hills, given all the final-round noise surrounding Tommy Fleetwood\u2019s 63 and Brooks Koepka retaining his crown. Meanwhile Rickie Fowler is doing just as well: more birdies, at 6 and now the tiny 98-yard par-three 7th, where he rolled in a 40-footer. He\u2019s suddenly -2 overall and must be wondering what the heck happened yesterday. Here comes Tiger! He starts the day at level par for the championship. Nine behind the leader Gary Woodland. Probably too far back, especially on a US Open course where you can\u2019t take too many liberties in chasing a low score. Then again, Lou Graham was 11 shots behind leader Tom Watson at the halfway stage of the 1975 Open, and went on to win his only major at Medinah. So nothing\u2019s impossible yet. However, flaying an iron off the 1st tee into the deep stuff down the left isn\u2019t an ideal start. He does pretty well to gouge back out to the fairway; he\u2019ll have to get up and down from 50 yards or so to save his par. So yesterday afternoon, Patrick Reed fluffed a chip and then did this ... Yes, yes, won\u2019t somebody think of the kids, etc. But let\u2019s face it, we\u2019ve all wanted to do that at some point in our lives. Is it as spectacular as Rory McIlroy\u2019s helicopter fling into the deep blue at Doral? Rory\u2019s meltdown was more measured and elegant, but hats off to Reed for the decisiveness of the act, all executed quickly, crisply, cleanly and without fuss. A bit like Withnail taking care of the live chicken at Uncle Monty\u2019s cottage. Also, his calm disposing of the bits and the way his caddie simply handed him another club, the pair getting on with business as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened, was a nicely paced comic conclusion to the scene. Role model: 0/10. Entertainer: 10/10. Anyway, whether he\u2019s in a better frame of mind today is a moot point: he\u2019s three over for his round through 16. He\u2019s +5 overall. Some early movement towards the bottom of the leader board. Tyrrell Hatton was out in 33, and has been parring his way along since. He\u2019s two under for his round through 14 and level par overall. Canadian Nick Taylor, the low amateur in this tournament way back in 2009 at Bethpage Black, has just birdied 11 and 13; he\u2019s two under today and level par for the championship. And Marcus Kinhult is the third player out there who has made it to two under for his round; the 22-year-old Swede, the current British Masters champ, is level par on his US Open debut. Rickie Fowler was leading this tournament after the morning wave on Thursday. A fine opening 66, but once again the prospect of that elusive major-championship victory proved to be one great tease. Having started slowly yesterday with a couple of bogeys, he looked pretty emotional when he then sailed a shot from the centre of the 18th fairway into the Pacific Ocean. He ended with a miserable 77, the low point a double after visiting the hazard down the right of the admittedly troublesome 8th. Ah well, as a student of links golf, there\u2019s always Portrush next month, it\u2019d be lovely to see him break his duck at the Open anyway. The popular Californian is off well today, with birdie at 3. He\u2019s level par for the tourney. Rhys Enoch reached the clubhouse late yesterday afternoon. The 30-year-old Welshman, who made it to Pebble Beach via the qualifiers at Walton Heath in Surrey, had been out in the penultimate three-ball, following up his miserable opening round of 78. Weekend participation looked extremely unlikely when he began yesterday with bogey at 1, but birdies at 4, 7 and 9, plus eagle at 6, saw him hit the turn in 31. He ended up with a 66, second best of day, bettered only in a US Open at Pebble Beach by Tiger Woods, Justin Rose and Gary Woodland (2000, Thursday and yesterday respectively). That meant he\u2019d swerved the cut, just, a sparkling performance from the Sunshine Tour regular. Enoch\u2019s been enjoying himself on the front nine again today, making consecutive birdies at 4, 5 and 6, though three bogeys have balanced out his card. He\u2019s level for his round through 13, and +2 overall. Here are a few of the names we\u2019ll be missing this weekend, on account of their failure to make the cut. The 2009 champion Lucas Glover; Branden \u2018Mr 62\u2019 Grace; Tony Finau; Jimmy Walker; Ian Poulter; Justin Thomas; Thorbjorn Olesen; the two-time winner Ernie Els; Kevin Na; Keegan Bradley; Kiradech Aphibarnrat; Kim Si-woo; Thomas Pieters; CT Pan. Or as major-championship Saturdays will soon be rebranded, Best Keep An Eye On What Brooks Is Doing Day. The two-time defending champion, looking to become only the second player to three-peat at a US Open, hasn\u2019t been playing that well this week, by his own lofty standards anyway. Yet he\u2019s still in a tie for sixth, just five shots off the lead, and Gary Woodland\u2019s had to post a bogey-free 65, equalling the Pebble Beach US Open record of Tiger Woods (2000) and Justin Rose (Thursday) to establish such an advantage. So it\u2019s on. The three-peat is still on. Woodland already looks tough to beat, mind. He was sensational yesterday. His birdie down 9, made despite his drive finding a deep divot, exemplified both his talent and steely determination. Long tipped for better things, without ever quite delivering, perhaps this is his time. But of course there are still 36 holes to play. With plenty of big names lurking, much could, and probably will, change over the next few hours, as the 119th United States Open Championship takes proper shape. Buckle up, it\u2019s going to be one heck of a ride around a track that\u2019s expected to get a little harder - and therefore harder - over the weekend. It\u2019s on! -9: Woodland -7: Rose -6: Oosthuizen -5: Wise, McIlroy -4: Reavie, Hadley, Kuchar, Koepka, Wallace -3: Stenson, Scott, Piercy, Rahm, Z Johnson, McDowell, Garcia, Schauffele Today\u2019s tee times (all BST, USA unless stated): 3.36pm Justin Walters (SA) 3.47pm: Rhys Enoch (Wal), Patrick Reed 3.58pm: Tommy Fleetwood (Eng), Tyrrell Hatton (Eng) 4.09pm: Shane Lowry (Ire), Martin Kaymer (Ger) 4.20pm: Kyle Stanley, Nick Taylor (Can) 4.31pm: Adri Arnaus (Spa), Tom Hoge 4.42pm: Clement Sordet (Fra), Erik Van Rooyen (SA) 4.53pm: Bernd Wiesberger (Aut), Alex Prugh 5.04pm: Andrew Putnam, Patrick Cantlay 5.15pm: Brandt Snedeker, Rafa Cabrera Bello (Spa) 5.26pm: Michael Thorbjornsen -a-, Chip McDaniel 5.37pm: Brian Stuard, Marcus Kinhult (Swe) 5.48pm: Colin Morikawa, Andy Pope 5.59pm: Cameron Smith (Aus), Jason Day (Aus) 6.10pm: Rickie Fowler, Bryson DeChambeau 6.21pm: Kevin Kisner, Marc Leishman (Aus) 6.32pm: Billy Horschel, Billy Hurley III 6.43pm: Daniel Berger, Rory Sabbatini (Svk) 6.54pm: Abraham Ancer (Mex), Hideki Matsuyama (Jpn) 7.05pm: Danny Willett (Eng), Luke Donald (Eng) 7.16pm: Emiliano Grillo (Arg), Chandler Eaton -a- 7.27pm: Tiger Woods, Byeong Hun An (Kor) 7.38pm: Viktor Hovland (Nor) -a-, Webb Simpson 7.49pm: Paul Casey (Eng), Charles Howell III 8.00pm: Charlie Danielson, Phil Mickelson 8.11pm: Haotong Li (Chn), Jason Dufner 8.22pm: Jordan Spieth, Nate Lashley 8.33pm: Harris English, Brandon Wu -a- 8.44pm: Dustin Johnson, Carlos Ortiz (Mex) 8.55pm: Sepp Straka (Aut), Matt Fitzpatrick (Eng) 9.06pm: Francesco Molinari (Ita), Jim Furyk 9.17pm: Xander Schauffele, Sergio Garcia (Spa) 9.28pm: Graeme McDowell (NI), Zach Johnson 9.39pm: Jon Rahm (Spa), Scott Piercy 9.50pm: Adam Scott (Aus), Henrik Stenson (Swe) 10.01pm: Matt Wallace (Eng), Brooks Koepka 10.12pm: Matt Kuchar, Chesson Hadley 10.23pm: Chez Reavie, Rory McIlroy (NI) 10.34pm: Aaron Wise, Louis Oosthuizen (SA) 10.45pm: Justin Rose (Eng), Gary Woodland"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
