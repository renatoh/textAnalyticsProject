The Italian's inability to attract top players and the unsettling effect his arrival has had on the club prompted the chairman to terminate his contract. Although talk of a power struggle with the coach Jean Tigana appears to have been exaggerated, Baresi's appointment, on a six-month probationary basis, has not had the desired impact. \"There is no problem any more,\" said Fulham's goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, currently on duty with the Holland squad. \"Baresi has gone and it is only Tigana now. Tigana has won the battle but all the players like working with him and it is not a problem.\" Sources at Fulham claim that Baresi was never considered to be the natural successor to Tigana and that the Italian's approach was considered unimpressive by club staff. His title had already been adjusted to that of football adviser to the chairman and his main role in recent weeks was to discuss the game with Fayed. The Italian's only signing was the Argentinian striker Facundo Sava, who joined while Tigana was on holiday. Sava has not finished a game since his arrival from Gimnasia and has played for 12 minutes in the last five games. Baresi, one of the best central defenders the game has produced, enjoyed a role as a vice-president at Milan before being tempted to Fulham. He was expected to raise the profile of the club and pinpoint new players but only recommended men such as Antonio Benarrivo and Angelo di Livio, ageing Italians thought to be past their best. Tigana is intent on signing young players who can be coached. \"Baresi came on a six-month trial period,\" Fayed said at the weekend. \"I wanted to have a legendary name such as his linked to Fulham but mainly I wanted him to repeat the role he had at AC Milan, where he scouted worldwide for players. \"The press translated Baresi as a manager in waiting when in truth there has never been a problem between the two men. I believe in experimentation in business and the same in football. That's why I created this unique role at a football club to maximise Franco's experience. Sometimes experiments don't work.\" The former Juventus defender Moreno Torricelli, meanwhile, is talking over a move to Portsmouth, although the manager Harry Redknapp has also approached Middlesbrough about their 33-year-old defender Gianluca Festa. Torricelli, 32 and one of many Fiorentina players looking for work following the club's demise, is in England to discuss a move. \"English football has always fascinated me - the stadiums, the play, the way of life - and now I have this opportunity with Portsmouth,\" he said. \"I have come to evaluate the opportunity with my family. I will make a decision by the weekend.\" The start of the Italian season will be postponed until September 15 due to some clubs' failure to agree TV contracts. A breakdown in negotiations with the state broadcaster RAI over a highlights deal and the unhappiness of several smaller clubs with live-match packages brought the issue to a head. Lazio have had three transfer deals blocked by the Italian league because of the club's parlous financial situation. Christian Manfredini and Eriberto will stay with Chievo and Massimo Oddo at Verona."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
