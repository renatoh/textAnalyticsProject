So why \u201clockdown\u201d in the first place? \u201cLock\u201d is an old Germanic word for a lock or other fastening mechanism, or a space enclosed by such a mechanism, which is why a lock in modern English is also a barrier in a canal. To \u201clock in\u201d (a person in a chamber) or to \u201clock up\u201d (originally the chamber or door itself) date from the 15th and 16th centuries, but a \u201clockdown\u201d is much more recent. It was only in the 1970s that \u201clockdown\u201d began to mean an extended state of confinement for inmates of prisons or psychiatric hospitals, and thereafter any period of enforced isolation for security. Originally, in 19th-century America, a \u201clock-down\u201d was a strip of wood or peg that secured the poles or a raft together when timber was transported by river. It is therefore a wistful irony that our present condition is named after a mechanism that once ensured the reliability of travel in the great outdoors. \u2022 Steven Poole\u2019s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
