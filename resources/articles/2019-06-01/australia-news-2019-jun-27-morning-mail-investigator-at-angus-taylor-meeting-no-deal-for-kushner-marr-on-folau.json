Top stories Angus Taylor says a meeting attended by an investigator from the unit examining alleged illegal land-clearing by a company Taylor part owns had nothing to do with the case. The meeting was held between Taylor, Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office and senior environment department officials. Guardian Australia revealed last week that Taylor met with Frydenberg\u2019s office and department officials to discuss the federal government\u2019s designation of critically endangered grasslands. The meetings occurred at the same time that New South Wales and federal investigations were underway into the poisoning of 30 hectares that contained the grasses on a property in the state\u2019s Monaro region owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. The former agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce expanded a taxpayer-funded farm finance scheme against the advice of Treasury, an audit has found. The scheme gives lucrative concessions to farmers. A report from the National Audit Office on the farm management deposit scheme shows that an expansion of the scheme, spearheaded by Joyce as minister in 2016, occurred despite none of the proposals having a \u201cstrong case for change\u201d. The auditor general, Grant Hehir, has also found that the FMD scheme, which held more than $6.6bn in deposits in June 2018, does not have \u201cfully effective\u201d administration processes, risk identification or compliance measures in place. This is despite the amount of foregone revenue from the taxpayer-funded scheme more than doubling from $245m in 2016\u201317 to $500m in 2017\u201318. Australian voters say it is more important to maintain funding for services such as health and education than giving workers on high incomes a tax cut, according to the latest Guardian Essential survey. The poll of 1,097 respondents suggests voters are not convinced of the merits of stage three of the Morrison government\u2019s income tax package if information is presented to them in terms of budgetary trade-offs. A strong majority, 78%, said maintaining government investments in health and education was more important than legislating a tax cut for workers on incomes of $200,000. Three-quarters of the sample said people earning more than $150,000 should pay a higher rate of tax than workers earning $40,000. World Jared Kushner\u2019s \u201cdeal of the century\u201d has failed to materialise in Bahrain, where Trump\u2019s senior advisor and son in law found no interest in his proposals for ending the Israel/Palestine conflict. The plan\u2019s central premise of prosperity as a precursor to a lasting solution barely appeared to register on either side of the separation wall, writes Middle East correspondent Martin Chulov. As the European heatwave continues, German officials imposed a 120km/h speed limit on stretches of the autobahn as the road surface began to deteriorate. A temperature of 38.6C was recorded on Wednesday in Coschen, near the Polish border, exceeding the country\u2019s previous June high, while rail tracks buckled near Rostock on the Baltic Sea. Sri Lanka\u2019s president has ordered the execution of four drug offenders, potentially ending a 43-year moratorium on capital punishment. Maithripala Sirisena, the president, said on Wednesday he had signed the death warrants. A Gambian pageant winner has accused the country\u2019s former president of rape as an investigation claims Yahya Jammeh systematically sexually abused young women. Jammeh, who reluctantly stepped down in 2017 after 22 years of rule, presented himself as a deeply religious figure and an advocate of girls\u2019 rights. Evidence is mounting that Parkinson\u2019s disease may start off in the gut. New research shows proteins thought to play a key role in the disease can spread from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain. More than 9 million people around the world play Candy Crush for between three and six hours \u2013 or more \u2013 a day, a top executive at the maker of the multibillion dollar game has revealed. Opinion and analysis With Israel Folau, the church is demanding a kind of free speech that keeps gays in the firing line, writes David Marr. \u201cThese Christians \u2013 by no means all Christians \u2013 are willing to burn up huge amounts of political capital to keep and, if possible extend, their power to punish homosexuals. It\u2019s a weird pivot of their faith. This is not all they want the Morrison government to shore up with legislation, but it\u2019s at the core of their demands. They are shy of saying it in so many words, of course, hence all the malarkey we\u2019ve been hearing from them for the last couple of years about freedom. Here\u2019s a simple principle: being decent and kind requires no legislation. You only need a religious freedom act to shelter behind when you plan to be nasty \u2013 say to age-old targets of your wrath like gays.\u201d \u201cThe latest engineering construction figures show yet more evidence that Australia\u2019s economy has been struggling for nearly a year now, and that the public sector is failing to fill the gap of falling private sector infrastructure work,\u201d Greg Jericho writes. \u201cWhat a difference a year makes. This time last year I wrote of the latest engineering construction figures that \u2018infrastructure spending remains well below peak levels\u2019 but \u2018fortunately the level of public infrastructure spending has been rising very strongly\u2019. And now, with the latest release of the engineering construction figures by the Bureau of Statistics, we see that the volume of infrastructure work done for both the private and public sectors has declined for four straight quarters and is now at its lowest level since 2016.\u201d Sport Donald Trump has warned Megan Rapinoe not to \u201cdisrespect\u201d her country. Rapinoe, who has won the World Cup and Olympics, is outspoken on social issues and was the first white professional athlete to kneel for the national anthem in protest of social injustice in the United States, before US Soccer passed a rule requiring team members to stand for the anthem. Wallabies coach Michael Cheika has flagged his side will adopt a new style of attack following the departure of former attack coach Stephen Larkham, who claimed the pair had fundamental differences in their philosophies. The Wallabies\u2019 plan of attack at the World Cup later this year might be a case of \u201ceverything old is new again\u201d as Cheika goes back to his roots in an attempt to revitalise the team, which last year endured their worst season since 1958. Thinking time: \u2018I\u2019d put on a smiling face, then go home and fall apart\u2019 Saturday night on the banks of the Ohio River, and the most American of scenes is unfolding. At the Ball Park, the Cincinnati Reds are playing the Texas Rangers, while at the US Bank Arena next door Carrie Underwood is making the latest stop on her global tour. Fans spill together through the muggy streets, a mingling of scarlet baseball jerseys and tan cowboy boots. This is Underwood\u2019s first tour since 2016, a huge two-hour, 60-date monolith of a show in support of last year\u2019s album Cry Pretty. It must be a strange time for such a quintessentially American artist to be visiting the wider world, especially one who is white, southern and religious. \u201cI feel like more people try to pin me places politically,\u201d she says carefully. \u201cI try to stay far out of politics if possible, at least in public, because nobody wins. It\u2019s crazy. Everybody tries to sum everything up and put a bow on it, like it\u2019s black and white. And it\u2019s not like that.\u201d Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reports that NSW Labor leadership hopeful Chris Minns \u201caccepted a banned donation from a Labor party fixer and property developer Bechara Khouri in the lead-up to his election to parliament.\u201d The Age\u2019s front page story this morning is Australia leads bid to sideline America. The headline Final act: Call the G-G appears above a photograph of a downcast Malcolm Turnbull on the Australian\u2019s front page, as the paper reveals that: \u201cThe day before Malcolm Turnbull was deposed, the prime minister clashed with attorney general Christian Porter over a last-ditch plan to save his leadership by persuading governor general Peter Cosgrove not to commission Peter Dutton as prime minister.\u201d Coming up US Democrats are preparing for their first showdown as the 2020 debates loom. 20 presidential hopefuls will go head-to-head in Miami on 26 and 27 June.
