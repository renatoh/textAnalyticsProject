I have always fought my corner, suggesting that we are not actually defective versions of women, but a fully realised gender, with our own special skills, talents and propensities. However, the evidence against this is mounting. A survey last month suggested women now score higher in intelligence tests than men. For the previous 100 years, men scored about five points higher, but that's all over. Now, we are officially the thicker sex. Women are conspicuously smart in areas where they were once told they were stupid. Men, meanwhile, are on a historic quest to discover their limitations, and women have been very willing to help out. Which is nice. Once, for instance, men didn't know they were emotionally inadequate. They believed that being distant and separated from their emotions was their role as fathers and husbands. Women have redefined this as a deficit rather than a virtue. The shortfall applies not only in the matter of emotional and intellectual IQ. My daughter Eva mentioned the other day that she \"preferred girls to boys because girls have a better sense of humour, they are less violent and prettier\". It is hard to disagree. I used to stand against this consensus of male shortfall, seeing it as a cultural cringe, but I am running out of road. I have observed enough marriages, including mine, to accept that men, in most cases, occupy the supporting role to the prime mover, the wife/mother. We still do \"better\" in the world of work, statistically speaking. This may be to do with sexism and that old, spectral enemy, the patriarchy, but I feel it is also partly because women, especially mothers, often experience intense conflict about competing at the same joy-destroying level of intensity in the career world as men. It is true that men run the political, military and financial establishments, but perhaps this has to do with men wanting to so desperately. These areas are the last bastion of male values \u2013 raw aggression and risk-taking. As such they are not much to be proud of. Men's only real clear area of superiority \u2013 brute strength \u2013 has become irrelevant. Last year, women aged 22-29 earned more than men. Childless women who have never married earn more than the average man in the thirtysomething age group. Women's buying power dominates the economy. The most successful group of athletes at the Olympics was American women \u2013 and we are never far behind the Yanks in social trends. Men, it seems, are simply not as well suited to the modern world as women. There are still things I \u2013 shamefacedly \u2013 prefer about men. Martin Amis once said his taste in fiction is largely homosexual: mine is too. I prefer to watch men play sport \u2013 women's tennis and football has never captured my imagination (athletics is an exception). But on the whole in the bigger game, the game of being, women have come out ahead \u2013 maybe not yet in terms of power and status, but in terms of ability, resourcefulness and moral standing. This is good news for all my daughters, and it will certainly come as no surprise to my wife. How do I feel about this? Not particularly delighted. But I feel I have taken a big step in finally admitting it to myself. Perhaps I am a modern man at last. How does it feel? Pretty much like women used to feel about male dominance, I imagine. Not that great \u2013 but impossible to gainsay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
