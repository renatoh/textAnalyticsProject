What shocks is how conventional he's become. The Dangerfield here, on the last night of a brief tour, was a distant relative of the one who frolics through gigs like a big, bearded puppy. There's a suit and tie, an acoustic guitar and a set of songs, mostly from the solo album Fly Yellow Moon, spawned by his recent state of \"unmitigated loved-up bliss\". But the woman who inspired the music has since left, leaving Dangerfield in the position of having to sing tunes that now must ring hollow. She Needs Me \u2013 introduced with \"I guess you want to hear the top 200 single, yeah?\" \u2013 contrasted a euphoric lyric (\"You pull another blanket round me/ 'Cos this is where I want to be/ She needs me\") with a subdued performance. Dangerfield's pearly voice was made for heartache; occasionally bolstered by two violinists, it endowed the songs with a bruised dignity. It hardly rose above a murmur on Firebird, a \"weird, slightly medieval\" tune that he said came to him in a dream. Great Crescendos, a raw blues anomaly that had him barking raggedly and scraping at his guitar, was the nerve-jangling odd one out. There was a whimsical encore involving a ukulele and a version of Guillemots' Made-up Lovesong #43 \u2013 a hint that there's still a rollicking kid inside, biding its time until Dangerfield is feeling better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
