On the eve of St Valentine's Day, the year-long love affair between Sven-Goran Eriksson and the English media finally showed signs of strain. Beneath the surface of last night's press conference in Amsterdam ran an undercurrent of tension that, encountered in a healthy relationship, tends to disappear of its own accord. In a different kind of environment, however, it can end up in the divorce court. This was the way the nation's bonds with Bobby Robson, Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan began to come untied. And in this case, as in most tiffs, it could easily have been avoided. Until this week, Eriksson had not been considered one of the Silent Swedes. Reserved, certainly. No one ever expected him to express himself in splurges of emotion. But since his arrival a year ago he has not seemed unduly reluctant to explain himself, although he has shrewdly deployed his limited command of the language to conceal his innermost thoughts without seeming impolite or unforthcoming. This week, however, he found himself bracketed with Greta Garbo, Ingmar Bergman and Bjorn Borg. By announcing his squad for tonight's match against Holland on Saturday, but failing to schedule a press conference until last night, he provoked the irritation of those whose terms of employment require them to convey his thoughts to the nation. Eriksson turned up last night, on schedule, and after a cursory question or two about his selection the discussion turned to his apparent reluctance to confront the media. \"When we have a match on Wednesday,\" he said, \"we come together on Monday and I have the players for only 2 days. When I started this job, I said I would do only one press conference. Time is very short. When we're together for a week, for something like a qualifying game, that's a different matter. \"Secondly, I don't like to see Eriksson-talk in the papers every day. And I don't think fans do, either.\" He may have a point there, but it is not one that would go down well with the editors of tabloid newspapers, to whom there is no such thing as too much of a good thing. And Eriksson's success in reviving England's fortunes has been one of the brightest features of life for tabloid editors over the past year, reinvigorating their coverage of the game in all its dimensions, from match reports on the back page to sex scandals on the front. This is something that Eriksson, for all his Swedish emotional continence, would do well to recognise. Coping with it, particularly if England get through the group stage of the World Cup, but even more so if they crash out at the first hurdle, will require a set of strategies designed to enable him to retain his sanity and his dignity. Both must have come under threat recently from that imbecilic British \"artist\" who makes a living from faking photographs of celebrities, using lookalike models posed in compromising or undignified attitudes, and then scoring a double-top by exhibiting them in art galleries and selling them for use as soft-drink advertisements. What does that say about the culture of contemporary Britain? And what must Eriksson have thought of us when he saw that this \"artist\" had faked a snatched photograph of him in his bathroom, wearing union jack underpants? On the other hand, this week's little problem could easily have been avoided. A short press conference on Sunday needed to occupy no more than half an hour of his time. There is also a plausible argument that a salary of \u00a32m a year carries with it an obligation to explain oneself when required. But these are matters of public relations strategy, for which the Football Association should take whatever blame may be going. One hopes it will have noted the effect of such a small incident and ensure there will be no repeats. For a start,it could show it has learnt the lesson by announcing that England's pre-World Cup retreat in Dubai will not be, as promised, a week of unbroken purdah but will contain one opportunity for media access to the head coach and his captain. Lovers sometimes fall out over the smallest things, and perhaps this is the equivalent of a disagreement over a bit of faulty map-reading. Let us hope Thursday morning brings champagne and red roses all round. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
