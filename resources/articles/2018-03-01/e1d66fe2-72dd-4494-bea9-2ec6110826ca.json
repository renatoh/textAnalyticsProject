In briefings after the surprise announcement \u2013 which would be the first ever meeting of leaders of the two countries \u2013 US officials made no mention of possible concessions that Trump might offer, other than saying that severe sanctions would stay in place until North Korea took verifiable steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. At the daily White House briefing, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders even cast doubt on Trump\u2019s acceptance of the offer of a summit, suggesting it was dependent on preconditions. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear. The United States has made zero concessions but North Korea has made some promises. This meeting won\u2019t take place without concrete actions that match the promises that have been made by North Korea.\u201d Sanders did not specify what actions the US required Pyongyang to take, and whether the demands amounted to more than the requirement of a pause in missile and nuclear testing, which Pyongyang appears to have already agreed to. The White House later appeared to minimise the impact of Sanders\u2019 remarks, with one official telling the Wall Street Journal: \u201cThe invitation has been extended and accepted, and that stands.\u201d Later, on Friday evening, Trump added to the confusion with a tweet about the meeting in which he added a qualifying phrase: \u201cif completed\u201d. The speed of events had Trump\u2019s administration scrambling to keep up with the president. Thursday\u2019s announcement appeared to have taken some senior US officials unawares: the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was travelling in Africa, and had told reporters \u2013 while the South Korean delegation was in the White House conveying the offer \u2013 that talks with the North were a distant prospect. Tillerson said on Friday that the US had been taken aback at Kim\u2019s \u201cforward-leaning\u201d approach but described the outcome as a success for the US policy of severe sanctions executed by the state department. He said Trump had made the decision himself after determining the time was right for \u201ctalks\u201d but not formal negotiations. The vice-president, Mike Pence, said that Kim\u2019s invitation to suspend nuclear tests and meet the US president proved that Trump\u2019s strategy was working. The North Koreans \u201care coming to the table despite the United States making zero concessions and, in close coordination with our allies, we have consistently increased the pressure on the Kim regime\u201d, Pence said in a statement. \u201cOur resolve is undeterred and our policy remains the same: all sanctions remain in place and the maximum pressure campaign will continue until North Korea takes concrete, permanent, and verifiable steps to end their nuclear program.\u201d Reacting to the announcement of the summit, the Chinese and Japanese governments have echoed the US line that there would be no let-up in the economic pressure on North Korea until Pyongyang began to dismantle its nuclear weapons and missiles programmes. It remained unclear if Kim is prepared to limit his arsenal and what he might require in return for doing so. Pyongyang had not commented officially on the summit plans since they were revealed by a South Korean delegation on Thursday night. A previous deal, the 1994 Agreed Framework, involved deliveries of fuel oil and the promise to build civilian nuclear reactors for North Korea. But Kim has consistently demanded an end to what Pyongyang calls Washington\u2019s \u201chostile policies\u201d which involve its military presence on and around the Korean peninsula and joint exercises with its ally, South Korea. Tillerson said it will take \u201csome weeks\u201d to arrange the timing for their meeting. US officials said that no time or place had been agreed. Bilateral talks in the past have been conducted in Geneva, New York and Beijing, but those involved diplomats. Kim Jong-un has not ventured outside North Korea since inheriting power from his father in 2011. A strong possibility as a venue would be the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas, a backdrop that would only add to the drama of an extraordinary encounter. In the coming weeks, the Trump administration will have to develop a negotiating strategy almost from scratch. Former officials have said that while much time and effort had gone into designing and enforcing sanctions, and planning military options, almost none had been devoted to putting together a plan for negotiation. The US special envoy for North Korean policy, Joseph Yun, left his post last week, depriving the administration of the single diplomat who had been in contact with North Korea. He had been contemplating retirement for some time, one of his colleagues said, but would have stayed on if he felt the White House had been interested in his efforts. The state department has been cut out of the loop on several critical moments in the evolution of administration policy on North Korea. Leadership on Korean policy has shifted to the White House. A likely key figure in the weeks running up to a summit is Allison Hooker, the only official left in the administration with firsthand experience of North Korea. She travelled there in 2014 when she was director for Korean affairs at the national security council and accompanied the US intelligence chief, James Clapper, to Pyongyang to negotiate the release of American detainees."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
