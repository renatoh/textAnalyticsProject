In 2001, when MSF started work in Nchelenge the focus was on providing care to people in their homes. In recent years as the stigma surrounding Aids has decreased and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) have become more available MSF doctors have moved away from providing care in individuals' homes and now work in rural health centres and the district hospital. As Riekje Elema, the head of mission in Zambia, explains: \"MSF is now working in nine out of 10 rural health centres in Nchelenge. We are trying to integrate HIV care with the Zambian health authorities as much as possible. In January we piloted a new system in 2 clinics whereby MSF hands over the care of all its patients to Zambian clinical officers and MSF staff take on a coaching role.\" One area of particular difficulty is the clear difference seen between men and women in seeking testing, counselling and care in this part of Zambia. As Riekje explains: \"Women generally have more exposure to voluntary counselling and testing as they come to the health clinics for medical care when they are pregnant or when their children are sick. In the clinics MSF staff will talk to them about the importance of getting tested. However even if they do decide to get tested often many women will have to seek permission from their husbands before they can start receiving treatment. For men it is another story. They must be almost dying before they come to a clinic for help.\" MSF is hoping to expand all its activities in 2006. The money raised by the Guardian appeal is already helping to support this effort. Today 480 patients are now receiving ARVs and 450 people are being tested monthly. In 2006 MSF teams will focus in particular on getting more men to go for testing, counselling and ultimately treatment. Information, education and communication will all play an important part. There is also a great need to provide more care for children and orphans. According to Riekje, \"If you have around 500 people on ARVs then about 10%, or 50 of them, should be children under the age of 15. MSF currently has only 12 children on ARVs so we still have a lot to do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
