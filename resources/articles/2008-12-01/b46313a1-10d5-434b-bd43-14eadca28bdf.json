The bizarre attack occurred in the 53rd minute of the game, immediately after Carlton Cole had held off Stoke's Andy Griffin en route to scoring an equaliser for the home side. Fuller was initially poised to take the re-start but then walked back 30 yards to berate Griffin. Despite attempts by team-mates to keep the players apart, the pair stomped towards each other and the Jamaican striker struck his captain in the face. The referee Michael Jones, who at first seemed unsure as to what had happened, had words with Griffin before showing Fuller a red card. West Ham went on to win the match thanks to an 88th minute goal by Diego Tristan. \"The funny thing is Rick and Griff get on very well,\" said Pulis. \"They even had a party over Christmas at which they exchanged shirts. But Rick is a very volatile person and I can't condone what he did. I've watch the incident on TV and he walks up and clips him on the chin. I'll have a team meeting on Monday and I'll deal with him then.\" Stoke eventually lost 2-1. Fuller's dismissal was Stoke's second of the festive period following Andy Wilkinson's red card against Manchester United on Boxing Day. Though he did not suggest the referees were wrong on either occasion, Pulis did complain that today's opponents, like United, should have suffered similar depletions. \"Luis Boa Morte committed two very bad fouls in the first 15 minutes but was only booked for one of them,\" said Pulis. \"There were incidents involving Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo the other day that the referee didn't seem to see. But they always seem to see things when it's us. I'm not asking for favours, just for parity. We have to be treated the same as everyone else otherwise the Respect campaign goes out the window.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
