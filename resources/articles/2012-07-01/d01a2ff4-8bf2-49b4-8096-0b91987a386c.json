In an interview with the BBC, the former chancellor has advised his longtime admirer to devote more time to running Britain's economy so that he no longer has to waste time on tactical discussions. His advice echoes criticisms from two of Osborne's biggest critics, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries. Balls has taken to calling Osborne \"the part-time chancellor\". Osborne has been the Tories' arch strategist since Cameron became party leader in 2005. He chairs the daily 4pm strategy meeting at No 10 with key advisers. Lawson, interviewed for today's Westminster Hour on Radio 4, said that Osborne should now give it up. \"I think it might well be sensible now for him to give up this central strategic job, which does involve chairing meetings and so on. \"George has on the whole a pretty good political antennae, political judgment and there's nothing to stop David Cameron saying, from time to time, 'George, what do you think of this? What do you think of that?', so his political thought is not going to be excluded if he gives up his role. \"I do think it might be sensible to give up the formal role and focus exclusively on his job as chancellor of the exchequer, which is a tremendously important job.\" Lawson, who was chancellor under Margaret Thatcher for six years from 1983, stopped short of echoing many Tory backbenchers who have called for Osborne to step down as chancellor too. \"I think his last budget was not his biggest success but I think he should continue in that job but I do think, as you suggest, that it would be sensible for him to set aside his second job,\" he said. It comes at the end of a torrid few months for Osborne. His reputation as keeper of the treasury has been damaged by a much-criticised budget, memorably described by Ed Miliband as an \"omnishambles\". Some Tory MPs have called him to be replaced by Boris Johnson's strategic adviser, Lynton Crosby. Friends of Osborne have described Lawson as one of Osborne's greatest heroes for freeing up Britain's economy and successfully managing a difficult and demanding prime minister. Lawson, who is the father of TV chef Nigella and the journalist Dominic, also suggested that Cameron should model himself on Margaret Thatcher rather than Tony Blair. \"There are basically two models of long-term premiership in recent memory: Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. David Cameron has modelled himself very much on the Blair style. I think the Conservative backbenchers prefer the Thatcher style. I do think he has a lot to learn from her,\" he said. \"And I think Blair is a bad role model, except in that particular time in history of changing the Labour party which had to be done. He was brilliant at that but I don't think that applies to the Conservative party at all. I don't think there is any read across,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
