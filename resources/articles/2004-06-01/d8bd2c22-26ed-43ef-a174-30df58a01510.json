Heuberger boasts his own clothing line, counts Martina Hingis among his ex-girlfriends but at No137 in the world he shouldn't trouble Henman too much. Mind you, that was said about Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo, who was a set and a break up on Britain's finest before doing the decent thing and losing. Player to watch Guillermo Coria won his first ever match at Wimbledon yesterday, taking three soggy, rain-delayed days to beat South Africa's Wesley Moodie. They began playing on Tuesday and were held up with the scoreboard frozen at 5-3, 30-30 in the fifth set until Coria won the two points he needed yesterday. He will be hoping today's second-round match against Florian Mayer proves a lot more straightforward. Shock in the making Greg Rusedski proved that off-court troubles haven't dimmed his ambition by beating Davide Sanguinetti yesterday. If he can do the same to the world No8 Rainer Sch\u00fcttler then that really will be reason for the British No3 to celebrate. Rusedski has one thing in his favour - he has won their only match, on grass, at Nottingham in 2001. Brit to follow Elena Baltacha's triumphant return from a six-month lay-off with liver damage may be cut short today by Jennifer Capriati but after the health problems she's had, the Scot may simply be delighted to be on a show court and against such an illustrious opponent.
