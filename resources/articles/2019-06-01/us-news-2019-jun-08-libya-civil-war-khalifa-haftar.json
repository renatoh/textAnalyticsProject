Encouraged by the 15 April call, Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA) hired lobbyists in Washington in the hope of arranging an official visit by the field marshal, who is a dual Libyan-US national, or one of his top aides, to reinforce the impression that he had US backing in his offensive against the UN-backed government in Tripoli. However, the lobbying firm, Linden Strategies \u2013 hired on a one-year, $2m contract \u2013 has yet to make progress as the tide shifts inside the Trump administration. With a volatile president, who has shown himself especially prone to persuasion from the Gulf monarchies and Egypt, policy could zigzag again. For now, US officials insist that Trump\u2019s phone call to Haftar was a personal favour to the Egyptian president, Abdul Fatah al-Sisi, who was visiting Washington a few days earlier, and did not signify a shift in US policy. \u201cState and defence were not aware of the Trump call, let alone supported it,\u201d said Jonathan Winer, a former US envoy on Libya. \u201cIt has taken a wrecking ball to our Libya policy.\u201d Ahmed Omar Maiteeg, the deputy prime minister of the Tripoli government, told NBC News on Thursday the Trump-Haftar call was confusing, \u201cbecause we see the US government as a our main ally\u201d. However, the pro-Haftar push inside the administration, while short-lived, went well beyond a phone conversation. On White House instructions, the US mission at the UN joined with Russia to block a UK-backed resolution calling for the end of Haftar\u2019s offensive. Bloomberg reported that Trump and his national security adviser, John Bolton, had explicitly supported the offensive, and Haftar boasted to senior UN officials that Bolton had given him the green light for the assault, on the condition he acted quickly. The White House would not respond to the claim. Haftar has made similar claims before which turned out to be unfounded, a former Obama administration official said. With Haftar\u2019s offensive stalled on the outskirts of Tripoli, Trump\u2019s fleeting enthusiasm for Haftar has waned, and the lead on Libya policy has been handed back to the state department. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has been consulting Libya experts in the past two weeks, and is considering a range of options, including a US-enforced ceasefire. European governments would like to see the US play an active role in persuading Haftar to pull back from Tripoli and enter ceasefire talks. \u201cPompeo is paying attention to Libya now, and is keen to get the policymaking process back on track,\u201d said a source familiar with the talks. Any US military involvement, however, would likely be resisted by Trump, who is keen to extricate the country from foreign military entanglements. \u201cIf you are a gut politician, would you want to change Libya from being Hillary\u2019s mess to your mess? He is thinking: don\u2019t embrace the mess,\u201d Winer said. Haftar\u2019s forces remain a potent threat to the government of national accord, led by the UN-backed prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj. Attempts to strike a ceasefire between both sides, which each lay claim to ruling the country, have so far failed, and regional powers backing Haftar and Sarraj appear more intransigent than ever. Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have all taken a stake in Haftar, a former officer in Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s military, while Qatar and Turkey have lined up behind Sarraj. US support for Haftar was thought to have been a potential game-changer. However, Trump\u2019s apparent change of heart appears to suggest that any solution to the conflict will be thrashed out on battlefields, or in diplomatic moves that are so far yet to take shape. France has voiced support for Haftar\u2019s military efforts against jihadist groups in Libya, but has not backed his Tripoli offensive, which the general is said to have launched without informing even sympathetic governments. Stephen Payne, the head of Linden Strategies, the lobbying firm, said: \u201cAfter having been in communication with Field Marshal Haftar for the past five years, and most recently meeting him in Benghazi, I knew we were on the right side of history.\u201d Persuading the state department or Congress will be an uphill struggle. The House foreign affairs committee has called for the justice department and FBI to investigate war crimes allegedly committed by Haftar and the LNA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
