Dominic Chappell bought BHS from the billionaire Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 in March 2015, but the company collapsed in April 2016 with the loss of 11,000 jobs. The Insolvency Service, which handles corporate collapses, had been seeking disqualification of Chappell and three other former BHS directors since March 2018. Chappell\u2019s father, Joseph, and another director, Colin Sutton, have also been banned for five years each. Another former director is still facing proceedings. Claire Entwistle, assistant director for the Insolvency Service, said: \u201cBoth Dominic and his father abused their responsibilities as directors. Not only did they carry out reckless financial transactions but they failed to maintain adequate company records \u2013 a basic requirement for any responsible director. \u201cThe courts have recognised the severity of their actions and the bans handed down will seriously curtail their opportunities to manage companies.\u201d The collapse of BHS was the biggest high street failure since the financial crisis, and left a \u00a3571m pensions black hole. The Insolvency Service has faced criticism for its handling of the scandal. Green, who owned BHS for 15 years, agreed to hand over \u00a3363m to the BHS pension scheme but escaped without a ban and also kept his knighthood, an outcome heavily criticised by MPs. Frank Field, the MP who chaired the work and pensions committee that investigated Green and Chappell\u2019s role in the BHS collapse, said: \u201cHere\u2019s yet another example of the monkey being shot while the organ grinder goes free.\u201d In a statement published on Tuesday, the Insolvency Service detailed a litany of wrongdoing by Chappell, including diverting BHS funds to other companies he owned and inadequate accounting. The high court heard Dominic Chappell wrongfully diverted \u00a31.5m of funds from BHS to a company based in Sweden a day after the imploding retailer\u2019s board had discussed placing it in administration. He also transferred more than \u00a31m in money made from sales of BHS\u2019s stores in Sunderland and London\u2019s Oxford Street to Retail Acquisitions, the company which he used to buy BHS. In total, the Insolvency Service questioned payments worth \u00a36m from BHS to companies related to Chappell and his father, and more than \u00a31.5m paid directly to Chappell. Chappell last year lost an appeal against a conviction for failing to hand over information to pension regulators. The judge in that case branded Chappell \u201cevasive\u201d, and said his evidence was \u201cuntrue\u201d and not \u201cat all credible\u201d. Chappell appeared in court in June to face separate charges of a \u00a3500,000 tax fraud and allegations that he bought two yachts to launder money. In February, the government said it planned to introduce lengthy jail sentences for executives who recklessly mismanage pension funds, in part because of scandals involving companies such as BHS and Carillion, the outsourcer that collapsed in 2018."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
