A few years ago he developed something of a fixation with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the then Chelsea manager, and spent part of his free time shadowing the \"Special One\". \"I know Chelsea well,\" said Pardew. \"Before I got this job and moved north, Chelsea was perhaps the team I visited most. I did a big study of Mourinho, how he played and how he got that unbeaten record at home.\" Along the way Mourinho, now coaching Real Madrid, invited him behind the scenes. \"I took in Chelsea's training ground a couple of times,\" said the Newcastle manager, whose family home in Surrey is handily placed for that facility while also being a relatively easy commute from Stamford Bridge. \"I just wanted to get my head round their incredible record at home under Mourinho. They must have gone two-and-a-half seasons without losing at home and Jos\u00e9 had done that at Porto before that. It wasn't just about great players, there was obviously something else going on. I came away with a couple of things.\" Many of Roberto Di Matteo's squad are familiar faces. \"I know Chelsea's players very well,\" Pardew said. \"They're re-motivated now. The fact that it was reported they needed to be replaced because they lacked legs has now worked on the other side of the coin. They're proving everybody wrong, that's what great players do.\" Di Matteo's Champions League finalists are sixth, one point behind the fifth\u2011placed Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur, who visit Bolton Wanderers night standing fourth, courtesy of superior goal difference. \"It's going to be a big night for Champions League qualification, there's no getting away from that,\" said Pardew. \"After Chelsea we've still got two more games left where things can change again but Wednesday will be significant.\" His Newcastle team ended a run of six successive wins with a 4-0 defeat at Wigan Athletic on Saturday and, on returning to training, the players were greeted by the chilling sight of a mobile cryotherapy unit parked at their weekday headquarters. It was filled with individual ice baths in which Pardew's first\u2011teamers plunged to hasten their physical recovery from the Wigan game, while perhaps also imbuing them with an extra mental edge. \"I don't think there'll be any problem with the psychology of our team now,\" he said. \"It has to be a bad time to play Chelsea but we're looking for a big reaction.\" Pardew accepts Newcastle may yet end up in the Europa League and is duly anxious to finish at least fifth rather than sixth, which would shorten the summer break by requiring involvement in early qualifying rounds. \"If we can't strive for fourth, it's important we strive for fifth.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
