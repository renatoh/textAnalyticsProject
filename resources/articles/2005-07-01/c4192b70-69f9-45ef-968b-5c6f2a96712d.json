The company said six of its drugs in mid-stage clinical trials should progress to the final phase of development after producing positive results. Glaxo has been slashing costs since the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in 2001, involving the loss of more than 8,000 jobs. Yesterday the pharmaceuticals company, the second largest in the world, said it is moving 150 financial jobs from Stockley Park, near Heathrow, to India. It has increased the proportion of clinical trials of its drugs in low-cost countries like China and Poland to 30%, and plans to increase this further. Cost cuts like these, along with strong growth in sales of its diabetes drug Avandia and asthma treatment Seretide, contributed to a rise in profits of 9% to \u00a31.7bn compared with the equivalent three months the year before. The profit growth was also helped by a reduction in legal costs. Overall sales grew 6% to \u00a35.2bn in the second quarter of the year. Analysts had been worried about the effect of losing sales of a slow-release version of antidepressant Seroxat and diabetes drug Avandamet after regulators said the quality of the tablets wasn't good enough and halted production this year. The problem has been resolved and sales have resumed. Glaxo's drugs division provided most of the increase, up 6% to \u00a34.5bn. Consumer healthcare, which includes Aquafresh toothpaste, Niquitin nicotine patches and Ribena, grew sales by 3%. Dr Jean-Pierre Garnier, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, said he was more pleased about the progress of the pipeline of potential new treatments. The company said results have been published from most of the drugs in mid-stage trials and that several were positive and would progress to late stage, or \"phase III\" trials. The others have either been put on hold by regulators or will be tested in a different way in phase II. \"No compound [drug] has failed so far, overall that is a fantastic score card,\" said Dr Garnier. \"There has been no death in the pipeline this quarter, and ... that is really really unusual.\" The drugs that will start phase III trials include Aplaviroc, a new HIV drug, '093, a potential diabetes drug, and a new flu vaccine, a spokesman said. Results from two diabetes drugs were \"inconclusive\", and further mid-stage trials will be carried out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
