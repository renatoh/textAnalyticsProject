The relevant passage from the presentation is reproduced for clarity: \"The current lack of unity and coordination between the numerous different organisations and agencies often manifests itself in a situation close to anarchy, both military and civil ... Add to this the multifarious agendas of the many NGOs; well-meaning but uncoordinated and lacking in strategic direction, and you have a recipe for confusion, disaffection due to promises undelivered and aggravated distrust of western intentions amongst the Afghan population.\" There was no suggestion Afghanistan was close to anarchy, but a specific comment on the lack of coordination among the international community. General Richards, as the commander of the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) in Afghanistan, then went on to say how the international community and President Karzai had addressed this issue through the creation of a new and powerful mechanism to decide on, and then implement, the government's policy. I hope this sets the record straight so your readers do not misunderstand what the general said, or form a false impression of the situation in Afghanis-tan. The country does indeed face many challenges, but is certainly not close to anarchy, due to the dedicated efforts of the soldiers and other members of the international community, and the determination of the government and people of Afghanistan. Lt Col Chris Borneman Chief information officer, International Security Assistance Force, Afghanistan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
