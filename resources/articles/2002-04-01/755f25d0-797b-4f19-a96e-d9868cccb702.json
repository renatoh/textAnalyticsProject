Record sales are heading south, numerous \"music-for-free\" web services are \"educating\" kids into getting their music for nothing and industry consolidation is slashing jobs across the board. All of which makes life pretty miserable for your average record company employee - be they a humble college starter or a highly-paid senior vice president. Still, it's not all gloom and doom. There's always the dance sector. In recent years dance music has rocketed in popularity in the UK; according to the International Federation of Phonographic Industries, it accounted for 13% - around \u00a3243m-worth - of music sales in the UK in 2000 fuelled by the estimated 5m clubbers in the UK. And while the club scene is not immune from fickle economies and taste, dance events at home and abroad still manage to heave with punters desperate for their favourite tunes and prepared to pay a small fortune to hear their DJ heroes play them. The mixing talents of top flight DJs are also in great demand from record companies looking to give their latest hit a fresh twist. Described by some as the rock stars of the 21st century, the cream of the UK's best DJs can earn anywhere between \u00a35,000 and \u00a350,000 for \"performing\" a two-hour set in a club in London's trendy East End or the \"superclubs\" in resorts like Ibiza, depending on the event. Those who additionally produce or make their own records, such as Paul Oakenfold, Tall Paul and Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim) earn huge - albeit undisclosed - sums. Consequently those who manage these individuals and book live appearances on their behalf stand to earn a considerable fee for the service - the going rate being between 15% and 20%, often charged to the promoter in addition to what he or she pays the DJ. For the successful it can be a glamourous lifestyle and travel to exotic destinations is often part and parcel of working for a successful DJ management outfit. But it is a tough market to crack. The hours are long, the work demanding and the success rate often low. Lee Bridle, who runs Most Wanted DJ Management, home to Judge Jules, says most of his 11 staff are young and ready to travel or stay out late when they need to. The work can put a huge strain on relationships as the demands of maintaining a home life clash with nightclubbing in several different continents over only a few days, he says. But for the determined - and ultimately successful -the rewards are there for the taking. Rachel Birchwood turned 25 earlier this month but already she has a high-flying career running DJ management company International Management Division - which oversees the business careers of Radio One DJ/record A&amp;R executive Pete Tong and others - along with her husband Eddie Gordon. And she juggles this with bringing up a 2 year-old daughter. Like many who now work in the dance industry Ms Birchwood was a regular clubber before becoming involved in the business. She first hooked up with top UK DJ Carl Cox in Ibiza when she was 17. \"I met Carl and became his personal assistant at his Ultimate Music Management company. In the summer of 1998 Carl set up IMD to represent some DJs outside the US and a year later we bought the company.\" DJs are seen as \"artists\" and in the dance industry, as with other areas of the music business, the hunt for new stars is crucial. \"There is a constant search for tomorrow's talent,\" says Ms Birchwood. \"You want to take today's nobodies and turn them into tomorrow's stars.\" Her doormat is deluged with demos from aspiring DJs, plus, she says, she is constantly \"out there\", listening to who's hot and who's not, finding out who's doing what in which clubs and what kind of reactions they are getting. Once the hunt for talent has unearthed the next \"big thing\" the work really starts. The DJs are relying on managers to further their prospects and their careers. \"You've got to throw a lot punches to get a result in this business,\" says Seven Webster, founder of 7PM, a Brighton-based record label and music publisher which also oversees the careers of DJs including Danny Howells and Kiss FM's Andy Morris. \"My colleague Steve Burton has pretty much driven Danny's career, fighting for him every day for the past four or five years. His career took off last year, but to work for four years and not make any money via someone you believe in, like, and work with is hard work,\" he adds. Just like the record industry, the route to success for the up-and-coming DJ is a tortuous one, says Tim Burnett, partner at agency/management company MN2S. \"We get sent demos all the time and if they're from 'no names' we advise they get personal management.\" What the management game is clearly about is contacts and who you know. And providing a service, says Mr Burnett: \"We supply DJs to clubs, co-ordinate the schedules, arrange the itinerary, flight, hotels, etc.\" A good relationship with the people on one's books goes a long way, he says. \"Ninety percent of our roster we know personally.\" It's that kind of business, apparently. Like many aspects of the music industry, further education is getting in on the act and many colleges are cottoning on to the demand for courses catering to those who want a career in the DJ business. One is the Guildford-based Academy of Contemporary Music, which is launching a music business degree course in September. The course, according to ACM general manager Dave Howell, will be a modular one, with artist and DJ management elements included. Some believe you only learn the job by \"living it and breathing it\" but Howell counters those who say academia has no place in such an environment. \"There are skills and theories that you can take on board on a course like this. It doesn't simply boil down to whether you've already got the makings of a good manager inside you. There are practices that can be developed here and it gives students a better chance to crack the industry,\" he adds. So, music degrees aside, what does one need to survive and thrive in the world of DJ management? A love of the music is vital, says Paul Wells of Elite Music Management, an agency/management company, as is the ability to get on with all sorts of people. \"Being genuinely into the music scene is essential, knowing the market, possessing decent communication skills and being organised. Oh, and common sense,\" Mr Wells adds. Mr Bridle adds: \"You must have someone who is really into the scene and who is friendly, flexible and knowledgeable. This business is changing from being informal and casual to being a major corporate industry.\" Business savvy is a plus and having existing management experience can put you streets ahead of the opposition, believes Paxton Talbot. \"If you can go into this business with a history of management acumen already behind you it'll be a great start.\" The founder of Lily Management, which organises dance festivals around the world and manages a number of up-and-coming DJs, Mr Talbot worked for seven years as a manager at TGI Friday where looking after the needs of more than 100 people taught him a lot. \"In order to retain their loyalty I had to keep them happy and cater for their own personal development.\" Those skills proved invaluable in his current line of work, he adds. People looking to succeed in the business also need to set themselves apart from the crowd and find something, be it a sound or an artist, that is different and original, believes 7PM's Mr Webster. Many enter for the money first and the music second, which in Mr Webster's view is wrong. \"First, anyone trying to map out a career path in management needs to ask themselves why are they doing it, where are they going and what do they want to achieve.\" There is also a marked difference between DJ agencies and DJ managers, he adds, the former largely concentrating on booking gigs for DJs they look after, the latter operating as career specialists. \"Although if you're able to combine the two areas you can make more of an impact and make the industry's ears prick up,\" he says. Succeeding in the business is one thing, but for anyone contemplating a career in DJ management, getting on to the ladder itself often proves the most tricky stage. \"There is no hard and fast way to get into this business,\" says Ms Birchwood. \"People who go to clubs understand dance music and the stuff that goes with it, which is an obvious advantage. One way would be to find out who the right companies are and work your way into one of them. Or call on your local club and ask them advice. \"Once you've got your foot in the door, be prepared to work for next to nothing. I started eight years ago on \u00a39,000 a year. My mum thought all this was a bad idea at first but she's come round since.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
