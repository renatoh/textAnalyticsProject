The reward for Feyenoord's 2-2 draw with Internazionale last night in the De Kuip stadium is a final on May 8 in the same arena with vast home support guaranteed for the meeting with Dortmund. Also guaranteed will be a huge security presence for a potentially combustible meeting of Dutch and German fans. The Rotterdam side triumphed 3-2 on aggregate and, though Dortmund lost 3-1 to Milan in the San Siro, that saw the German club through 5-3 overall. Dortmund, despite their 4-0 first-leg advantage, apppeared in greater danger in the semi-final second legs from the lingering Italian threat when Milan halved the deficit within 19 minutes through goals from Filippo Inzaghi and the Romanian defender Cosmin Contra. But Milan could not break through again until the last minute, when Serginho scored from a penalty to take his side tantalisingly close to a remarkable comeback. But seconds later Lars Ricken put the issue beyond doubt with the Germans' sole goal of the night. In Rotterdam, even the return of Ronaldo for his first start in more than three months could not prevent Inter sliding out, despite two goals in the last six minutes from Cristiano Zanetti and Mohamed Kallon with an injury-time penalty. The Dutch had already done further damage, Pierre van Hooijdonk scoring with a powerful header for his seventh European goal this season and Jon Dahl Tomasson adding Feyenoord's second before half-time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
