The remarks came as part of a barrage of disparaging comments that threaten to re-ignite an ongoing feud with the Democratic congresswomen Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. They seemed to refer to a perception that Jewish Americans have a dual loyalty to both America and Israel. Trump, who recently encouraged Israel to block Tlaib\u2019s visit to see her family in the occupied territories, lashed out after the congresswomen criticized Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government for denying them entry, vowing that the Israeli leader would not \u201csucceed in hiding the cruel reality of the occupation from us\u201d. Calling Omar a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Jews, Trump said he didn\u2019t \u201cbuy\u201d the tears Tlaib had shed Monday at an emotional press conference during which Tlaib talked about her decision not to travel to Israel to see her elderly grandmother, who lives in the occupied West Bank. \u201cWhere has the Democratic party gone?\u201d Trump asked reporters at the White House. He then went on to apparently refer to Jewish Americans\u2019 supposed loyalties to Israel and how voting Democratic was disloyal to the country. \u201cWhere have they gone, where they\u2019re defending these two people over the state of Israel? And I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d Accusing Jewish Americans of having dual loyalties to America and Israel is widely seen as an antisemitic trope. The comment provoked immediate condemnation from a raft of American Jewish leaders. Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, pointed out on Twitter that charges of disloyalty \u201chave long been used to attack Jews \u2026 It\u2019s long overdue to stop using Jews as a political football\u201d. J Street, the progressive Jewish American lobbying group, released a statement in which it called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cdangerous and shameful\u201d. It noted that 70% of American Jews voted for Hillary Clinton against Trump in the 2016 presidential race, adding \u201cthis vast majority of our community rejected and continues to abhor the xenophobia, bigotry and extremism of Donald Trump and his allies\u201d. Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, also waded in. Calling himself \u201ca proud Jewish person\u201d, he said: \u201cI have no concerns about voting Democratic. And in fact I intend to vote for a Jewish man to become the next president of the United States.\u201d This is not the first time that Trump has been castigated for invoking the \u201cdual loyalty\u201d antisemitic trope. In April he called Netanyahu \u201cyour prime minister\u201d in front of the annual meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
