Here\u2019s the match report, which includes the word \u2018mojo\u2019 in the headline. Van Persie pointing out how many times Rashford and Martial made dozens of great runs but never received the ball. A sign of United\u2019s issues. A very honest interview from Luiz, who points out the team were unhappy and unfit under Emery. Luiz: \u201cI think it was great. We did a great first-half and we were a mature team in the second. \u201cPhysically we are not ready. When you are physically not there you have to show heart. \u201cWe are trying to change things but you can\u2019t go from zero to 10 in one day. It\u2019s great to see how committed the kids are. \u201cMikel is a great coach. I think he can improve every single player. In life, when you are happy, results can be a lot different.\u201d Sokratis: \u201cWe have to start again. We have a lot of space to improve. Second half we did not play like the first half but I think every game is better. The fans are back and I hope the new year brings the best. \u201cWe are not ready to fight for 90 minutes and this second half again today we were struggling but every players like the way we play.\u201d Don\u2019t take my word for it ... United just could not create anything of use. Lingard and Pereira were frankly poor (and have been for a while). Surely Solskjaer must do all he can to sign Christian Eriksen. Mesut Ozil completed 90 minutes which is a rare sight. I say this without any research but it\u2019s certainly a positive for Arsenal. The Emirates is singing Sweet Caroline while Arteta goes to each member of his team to celebrate. They players seem to like him, that\u2019s for sure. A fine first-half performance from Arsenal was enough to see them through. Their attacking players excelled and created two well-worked goals, while their defence solid throughout and United just could not break it down. 90+2 mins: There\u2019s been plenty off huffing and puffing from United but without any real quality in the final third, which must worry Solskjaer. The latest being Mata finding Rashford in the box but he volleys into Leno\u2019s chest. Keown gives Luiz Man of the Match. It could have been a number of players in their defensive ranks. Torreira and Xhaka have also been excellent. 90 mins: Four minutes added on. 89 mins: Aubameyang breaks clear of Fred, who tries to take him down but fails. The striker gets to the edge of the box and tries to find the marauding Nelson but the cross is not good enough and United clear. Daire Finnie offers: \u201cMaguire on course to be United\u2019s most expensive mistake since Pogba. He may yet come good but the first 20 odd games for United he has been by far the weakest link in defence..even when Young has played.\u201d 87 mins: If Arteta\u2019s methods are going to work then he needs a fitter squad. Other (better) teams than United will break them down if they are this fatigue in the second half. They are still holding on here. 85 mins: Arsenal are playing very deep and United just cannot find a way through at the moment. 83 mins: Torreira has taken on some energy gel and is battling his way through the final few minutes. 81 mins: Arsenal have some issues. Lacazette is down, Torreira looks done for. Arteta only has one sub left. In the end Guendouzi replaces Lacazette. Mata replaces Matic for United. 79 mins: Aubameyang cuts in from the left, dribbles towards the box, gives it to Lacazette who opens his body up but whacks his shot high and wide from 20 yards. Saka leads a break out from Arsenal, using his fresh legs to dribble beyond on the United defence but he shoots off-balance and it trickles into De Gea\u2019s hands. 77 mins: Guendouzi is ready to come on, one assumes for Torreira. 75 mins: Fred swings in a cross from the right, after the referee has a word with Sokratis about something or other, which Leno punches clear. Arsenal break and Ozil plays a fine pass for Lacazette to run onto but the Frenchman is static. 73 mins: United are penning Arsenal in and the hosts are struggling to hold them back. Greenwood collects the ball on the edge of the area and strikes a low drive which Leno drops on top of. 71 mins: Martial pulls the ball back from the byline, Fred collects it and lays it off to Wan-Bissaka who takes the ball into the box and goes down under a challenge. United call for a penalty, Arsenal claim its a dive and VAR gives nothing. 69 mins: Kolasinac has dropped to the floor with his usual ankle issue and he is replaced by Saka. I would argue the second was not a bookable offence but it was a close call. You do indeed have a point. 67 mins: Holding looked like he was coming on but he\u2019s put his training gear back on. Maybe someone has a problem in the Arsenal defence ... 65 mins: United are putting pressure on the Arsenal defence. Martial drives into the Arsenal box only to be crowded out but he gets the ball to Pereira, who lays it off to Rashford and he curls a shot just over the bar. 63 mins: Pepe departs and Nelson comes on. Martial pushes the Arsenal man off the side of the pitch to speed up proceedings. This tweet was supposed to be sent to Metro, I believe. 61 mins: Arsenal have certainly slowed down in this half, like they did against Chelsea. They need to work on their fitness so they can keep up the tempo required by Arteta for 90 minutes. 59 mins: Matic turns himself inside and out on the edge and then works it through to Pereira but he snatches at the shot and it whacks into the side netting. I am not saying it is the rules, just that it could be a factor in the referee\u2019s mind. Send your complaint letter to Chris Kavanagh. 57 mins: Pereira and Greenwood are on for United. Lingard is coming off, as he\u2019s been awful, and James is also withdrawn. 55 mins: James gets into the box and spots a gap at the front post so tries a cheeky shot but Leno gets down well and holds on. Fred whacks one from 25 yards with his right boot but it\u2019s right down Leno\u2019s throat. 53 mins: Lingard fires a shot from 20 yards but it is blocked by Luiz in the area. United are having more of the ball in this half but struggling to do anything with it. 51 mins: United have sent a few players out to warm up. Changes must be coming. 49 mins: Martial dissects the defence with a pass but it\u2019s got too much on it for Rashford and calmly dribbles into Leno\u2019s arms. Fred again scythes down Lacazette and still avoids a booking. Kolasinac got carded in the opening few minutes for a little push. The referee has been inconsistent. 47 mins: Luiz comes out of defence to whack the ball against James for his own amusement. Fred then catches Lacazette on the shin but the referee takes no further action. No changes for United but surely it cannot be long until Solskjaer rolls the dice. Here we go again! Dael Morris points out: \u201cUnited look woeful. You\u2019ve been right that the problems are with Matic, who\u2019s simply outpaced, and Shaw, who\u2019s simply not good or smart enough, but you have to credit the Arsenal team\u2019s willingness to press everyone in possession. United look stunned every time they\u2019re closed down. Also, both Lindelof and Maguire are at fault for the goals. They both need to be closing down attackers and in the case of both goals the goal scorers have far too much time to decide what to do, mainly because the defenders are clueless. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird game to watch as a United supporter, because United look like they have never really started and are trying to remember what they were told in the briefing, rather than deal with what they\u2019re actually facing. It\u2019s all common this season to see United play like they\u2019re learning.\u201d Certainly the best I\u2019ve seen Arsenal play for a long old while. I am taking nothing away from them. Already on a booking, so a touch of lenience added? Martin Lancon asks about Luiz: \u201cHow does he get away with it, two off the ball fouls, both seen by VAR, one given as foul, surely yellow in hindsight after first. He used to get away with it at Chelsea as well, sneakily dirty player but never carded because never seen by ref the type of incident that I thought was one of the reasons for VAR.\u201d He knows when to do it to avoid the glare of the officials. David Moyes is a genius. Yeah, to be fair it was. I am just trying to rebuild Ozil\u2019s reputation singlehandedly. Peter Oh tries to bring intelligent thought to this blog: \u201cThe Arsenal attack asking questions that the United defence can\u2019t answer. The Sokratic method?\u201d United looked bright in the opening few minutes but have been woeful since. There\u2019s been plenty of zip about Arsenal and they thoroughly deserve the lead with their front four looking extremely dangerous whenever the ball goes near them. 45 mins: One minute added on. 44 mins: The Emirates is bouncing, something which has not happened for a while. United need to change things at half-time. Greenwood on for Lingard? Ozil drifts into space, collects the ball and picks a pass over the top to Maitland-Niles\u2019 run down the right but his cross is blocked by Maguire. The resulting inswinging corner from Pepe is flicked on at the front post by Lacazette and De Gea can only palm it into the danger zone where Sokratis is waiting to smash the ball in from a few yards out. 40 mins: Lacazette drifts out to the right from where he bends in a super cross along the six-yard line but there is no one there to meet it. Arsenal are definitely a more attacking and inventive force under Arteta. Long may it continue. 38 mins: De Gea\u2019s latest error sees him try to whack a clearance straight into Lacazette but it just clips the striker and goes about 18 yards to Pepe, who pikcks up the ball, cuts in and curls a shot against the base of the post. A let-off for De Gea and United. 36 mins: Arsenal have been on top in this game since the opener and United do not seem to have a gear change. Is it down to the fixture schedule or just a bad performance? It might not be a bad idea. Lingard also not in the game. 34 mins: Torreira is the next to have a pop. He spins on the edge of the box, gets the ball onto his left foot and swings through his shot but the ball goes inches wide of De Gea\u2019s left-hand post. 32 mins: Lacazette should double the lead. Pepe lays it into Lacazette in the area, he spins Maguire but then sends his shot closer to the corner flag than the goal. 30 mins: Maguire then seems to catch Lacazette when jumping for a header but the referee sees nothing in it. It looks like Maguire catches the striker in the back of the head with his elbow, leaving the Frenchman to rub his head. There is nothing malicious in it but it should be a foul. 28 mins: Martial drives into the area but Sokratis gets round to clear the ball out of a throw. A less successful intervention from a centre-back sees Maguire clean out Ozil about five seconds late to stop a counter-attack. 26 mins: One obvious thing about United is how much they miss McTominay in the middle of the park. No one else can match his energy in there and things just look quite sluggish. To mix things up, a long ball is played over the top for Rashford to chase but Leno reads the danger and comes outside of his box to head clear. I think turning the defence and using the pace of their attackers could be a fruitful concept tonight. 24 mins: United are popping the ball around a bit but they are struggling with the final pass. A fine joke: 22 mins: It might not be his best position but Aubameyang is dangerous on the left, whipping in a delightful cross with the outside of his boot which just defeats everyone and Shaw clears. Ian Collins writes in to discuss poor Luke: \u201cAre we saying that Jose was right about the once great hope for England left back and that he\u2019s just not that good?\u201d I agree with Mourinho on everything. 20 mins: Arsenal\u2019s front four seem to have a better understanding than United\u2019s who are yet to click tonight, playing some sloppy passes as attacks keep breaking down. 18 mins: Maitland-Niles pulls down Rashford, who for added effect jumps up a bit to show it is a foul. United need to get Fred on the ball a bit more as Matic just does not have the passing range to cause problems. 16 mins: This sounds delightful ... as a fellow south Londoner, I can confirm this is not a regular occurrence but I am also quite pro-Pepe. 14 mins: Luiz is done for holding Martial on the halfway line, which is frankly pointless. He looks to be playing on the edge tonight. 12 mins: Shaw might be in a for dreadful evening trying to stop Pepe, purely because the United man isn\u2019t actually very good. He does not look smart enough to keep the Arsenal man quiet. 10 mins: Just before the goal I was typing about how United had started the better but needed to make the most of it. They proved me right. Pepe almost turns provider by rinsing Shaw just outside the area - in the end the defender does well to not give away a penalty - the winger then lifts a ball to the back post to Aubameyang who volleys over. Some fantastic work down the left flank from Kolasinac sees the defender get to the byline, from where he pulls the ball back into a dangerous area to a waiting Pepe and he sidefoots the ball into the back of the net. 6 mins: Maitland-Niles puts his team into trouble by passing the ball straight to Lingard who drives forward and slips in James but Arsenal recover and the ball is diverted behind for a corner, which comes to nothing. 4 mins: Kolasinac bundles over James who is far too quick for the full-back. The Arsenal defender in the end gets booked for his indiscretion - not good news for a man who is up against one of the fastest players in league. Fred whips in the set-piece but Leno comes out and punches clear. Martial is also unhappy after being caught late by Luiz, who gets away with it. 2 mins: United start the game brightly and break on Arsenal, resulting in Lingard laying it off to Rashford who lines up a drive from 25 yards which dips and bounces but Leno gets himself behind it. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The players are in the tunnel but I doubt we will see any Vieira v Keane-esque shenanigans. Looks quiet. I think it\u2019s fair to say it is a crisp day in London. Lovely night for a zipping the ball around the Emirates. The battle for second is still on! Graham Fulcher asks: \u201cRe the small piece of news. I wonder if they would have been better extending the loan. Some players with Championship experience could prove invaluable next year.\u201d I have a feeling he will be off elsewhere. Bristol City are very interested. Paul Mullally brings the pleasantries: \u201cFirst off happy new year. As a lifelong United fan, Pogba missing tonight\u2019s game is not surprising players hold the power in this day and age is Mino Raiola up to some mischief? Anyway enjoy the game United 2 Gooners 1.\u201d Happy New Year to everyone! Even Mino. Small piece of Arsenal news: they have recalled Eddie Nketiah from Leeds. BT Sport have been surprisingly smug about being on air all day. It\u2019s literally your job, lads. And well done for making Manchester United fans travel down to London for an 8pm kick-off. Kim Doyle is hoping for goals: \u201cIt is a new year for the Gunners and an offensive look that all the fans have been waiting for \u2013 Auba, Laca, Ozil and Pepe all starting. Perhaps a flurry of goals will follow.\u201d Not a good sign ... Paul Pogba is \u201cfeeling some discomfort in his ankle and he\u2019ll be out for a few weeks - definitely\u201d, says Solskjaer. Hmmm ... Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. Some potential January moves in this morning\u2019s Rumour Mill ... I am expecting Aubameyang to play on the left, which is a shame as it\u2019s certainly not his best position but Arteta has obviously decided the way to go is to get all his best players onto the pitch and fit them into a formation. Bill emails in: \u201cRe the 606 call (18.57), any analysis of Arsenal\u2019s descent will have to include a look at the seemingly entitled, paranoid, delusional, highly critical parts of the fan base, I\u2019d say. I think Arteta seems to have a great plan and be acting intelligently. No wonder he\u2019s had to spend time rallying the fans, but should that be necessary? I can see the point of being vocal where it\u2019s due (Emery was a mistake from the off), but surely support should go the other way, from fan to club\u201d Welcome to a new year. No Pogba once again for United, which will fuel a few rumours, I am sure. He didn\u2019t feature at Burnley due to some degree of fatigue. Can he still be tired? January business for United? Xhaka and Torreira are paired together as the wall to stop Manchester United and that Arsenal front four looks rather exciting: Pepe, Ozil, Aubameyang and Lacazette. Matic keeps his place in midfield for United, while Shaw will line up against Pepe, which will be an intriguing battle. Arsenal: Leno, Maitland-Niles, Sokratis, Luiz, Kolasinac, Xhaka, Torreira, Pepe, Ozil, Aubameyang, Lacazette. Subs: Martinez, Ceballos, Holding, Nelson, Willock, Guendouzi, Saka. Manchester United: De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Matic, Fred, James, Lingard, Rashford, Martial. Subs: Romero, Jones, Mata, Pereira, Young, Greenwood, Williams. An Arsenal \u2018fan\u2019 has just phoned up 606 to say they are going down and Aubameyang and Lacazette aren\u2019t good enough. I know things aren\u2019t great the the moment but to say the Gunners will be relegated is bizarre. Odd chap. Here\u2019s David Hytner on Mikel Arteta\u2019s worries. Happy New Year! Hopefully by now your hangover has subsided and you have moved back onto solids. Speaking of hangovers, Arsenal are still trying to get over the one induced by pumping 75% proof Unai Emery into their veins. New boss Mikel Arteta looks to have brought some endeavour and freedom to Arsenal\u2019s attacking players but the same old issues continue in defence and it cost them two late goals and the match against Chelsea. Arteta will be hoping he can secure his first win tonight but that will not be as easy as it seemed a couple of months ago. Manchester United have lost just once in their last nine games and will be hoping to carry that fine form on at the Emirates. Paul Pogba could be brought back into the side after sitting out the relatively routine 2-0 win over Burnley. Unlike Arsenal, United have plenty of players who have found consistency and look like they could genuinely challenge for a top-four spot. Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are very much on the same wavelength and Fred is running things from midfield, which is a bit of a shock considering the fact he spent a long time at the club looking woefully out of his depth and it\u2019s even better news due to the injury to Scott McTominay. The United defence was never in trouble at Turf Moor, an impressive feat for a side who have struggled to keep cleansheets this season, not helped by their goalkeeper chucking one in. It\u2019s a new year and new beginnings, which is cracking news for Arteta, while Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will just want to carry on where he left off last year. Should be a cracker under the lights. Kick-off: 8pm GMT"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
