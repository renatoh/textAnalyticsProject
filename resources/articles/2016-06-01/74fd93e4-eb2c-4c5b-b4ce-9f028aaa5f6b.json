That\u2019s how many days are left until the federal election. Count \u2018em. Fifteen. As we emerge from the desert on this, the 40th day of the election campaign, take heart in knowing that tonight you, the average punter, will be able to fire your questions at both Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten on Facebook, the people\u2019s forum, through Joe Hildebrand, who was, by his own admission, shocked to hear he was the people\u2019s moderator. Hildebrand has written on News Corp websites about his existential angst over being asked to moderate the debate, and notes that the scheduled kick-off time of 6pm Friday night was \u201ctraditionally known as a dead zone on the internet.\u201d But, he notes, a lot of people seem to be talking about the election on Facebook, so let\u2019s give it a crack. Questions for the debate actually close at midday, which doesn\u2019t sound super interactive, but it does mean that technically you could participate in democracy during your tea break and still go to the pub after work. With that cheerful thought, make a cup of tea and let\u2019s dive into Friday. The big picture A historic event took place at Kirribili House last night. Malcolm Turnbull, fresh from a day dodging questions about Parakeelia, celebrated Ramadan by hosting an iftar, fast-breaking dinner for prominent Muslim Australians, as well as people of other faiths. My colleague, Paul Karp, writes that it\u2019s the first such event hosted by an Australian prime minister. Turnbull told his 75 guests in a pre-dinner speech that the broader Muslim community should not be blamed for the acts of a few extremists. The aim of extremists, including those committing violence through a warped and nihilist interpretation of religion is to divide us and to turn our citizens against each other \u2013 but we will not let them win. \u201cActs of terror like Sunday\u2019s massacre in Orlando are perpetrated to divide us along lines of race, religion, sect and sexuality \u2013 but that kind of hatred and division must not prevail We must stand together like we do tonight as one Australian family united against terrorism, racism, discrimination and violence Among the guests were Gold Logie winner Waleed Aly; his wife, sociologist Dr Susan Carland; AFL player Bachar Houli; AFL national diversity manager Ali Fahour; Australian Multicultural Foundation director Hass Dellal; and youth advocate Yassmin Abdel-Magied. Turnbull was interviewed by Aly on Channel 10\u2019s The Project later that evening, and admitted that he had not fasted but \u201cjust showed up for the meal.\u201d Another guest was Sheik Shady Alsuleiman, president of the Australian National Imams Council, who, The Australian noted, has made anti-gay comments and was therefore, it suggested, not the best guest for an event that focused on unity in the wake of the mass murder of 49 people in a gay club in Orlando, Florida. The Herald Sun was more forthright, headlining it\u2019s coverage with: \u201cPrime Minister dines with hate preacher.\u201d While Turnbull hosted the multi-faith event, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, joined members of the LGBTI community in a vigil in Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square for victims of the Orlando massacre. Turnbull attended a service for the victims on Wednesday night. It was a reprieve from a day\u2019s politicking in which Parakeelia, the software company owned and used by the Liberal party, continued to dominate debate. Shorten called Parakeelia a scam, saying: This looks like a Liberal party washing machine turning taxpayer dollars into Liberal party profits. While the Liberal Party\u2019s national director, Tony Nutt, said the company was: ...run on a professional basis, independently audited and complies with the law. According to a report in the Fairfax press, that\u2019s not entirely true. Reporters James Robertson and David Wroe write that Parakeelia allegedly failed to inform ASIC of changes to company shareholdings for 15 years, due to a \u201cclerical error.\u201d The \u201cerror\u201d was that former Liberal party treasurer Ron Walker, who resigned in 2002, was, at least until Wednesday afternoon, listed as a 98% shareholder in the company. When told of this fact by Fairfax, Walker reportedly said: That\u2019s impossible. I was assured that I had resigned. I relinquished all other directorships. Malcolm (Turnbull, who was party treasurer in 2002 and 2003) took over from me. He succeeded me as federal treasurer of the party. He assumed all responsibilities I had on that day. Walker then apparently called Liberal HQ and was told the letter \u201cwas never sent to ASIC \u2013 clerical error,\u201d and that Nutt said it would be remedied the next day. Interestingly, Fairfax ran a remarkably similar story in 2007, in which Walker said remarkably similar things. The Australian\u2019s David Crowe, in an excellent analysis that you can find here, writes that Parakeelia would not go away as an issue because it \u201coffers another example of the way politicians like to live in a world with special rules and no questions asked\u201d. On the campaign trail Malcolm Turnbull has woken up in Sydney and will take an early morning flight to the seat of Page on the NSW far north coast, where he\u2019ll announce a $25m NSW North Coast Jobs and Investment package alongside Barnaby Joyce and Fiona Nash later this morning. The package is intended to provide innovation grants, with businesses matching government investment dollar-for-dollar, to \u201cincentivise business to invest, deliver new export opportunities and boost regional jobs\u201d. Bill Shorten is flying to Hobart, where he will announce a program called Working Futures, designed to deliver training to 20,000 unemployed youths a year. The program will provide a six-week course teaching employment, presentation, interview and job search skills; a six-month work placement paid at an award-equivalent training wage, and result in a fully funded Certificate III of the participant\u2019s choice. The campaign you should be watching Ken Jasper, who held the Victorian state seat of Murray Valley for the Nationals for 40 years, has raised the ire of Liberal candidate for Indi, Sophie Mirabella, for recommending people preference independent MP Cathy McGowan ahead of her. Jasper gave McGowan his endorsement in 2013. He has recommended that people give Nationals candidate Marty Corboy their first preference and McGowan their second. Mirabella said it was \u201ca very dishonourable thing to do\u201d. But Jasper, who has made no secret of his criticism of Mirabella, seemed quite comfortable with his decision. And another thing(s) The Labor candidate for the western Sydney seat of Lindsay, Emma Husar, where the Labor party will (finally!) hold their campaign launch on Sunday, has reportedly deleted old Facebook posts in which she awkwardly said that all politicians \u201clie, steal and cheat.\u201d According to Fairfax\u2019s James Massola, Husar also deleted a photo of herself hugging a giant red condom. Speaking of campaign launches, the Australian reports that Tony Abbott was expected to attend the Liberal party\u2019s official launch on Sunday week, and expected to have \u201chis contribution to the Coalition\u2019s election acknowledged\u201d. This followed a rapidly shut-down campaign, apparently driven by talkback radio hosts, to make Abbott defence minister.
