The collision is believed to have involved a police motorcycle and happened as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made their way from London to Windsor. William and Kate were \u201cdeeply concerned and saddened\u201d by the event and had been in touch with the elderly woman\u2019s family and sent flowers, a spokesperson told the Daily Mail. The Independent Office for Police Conduct said the woman, named by neighbours as Irene Mayor, 83, had been taken to a London hospital in a serious but stable condition. \u201cIn line with procedure, the Metropolitan police service referred the collision to the IOPC,\u201d said the public body in a statement. \u201cOur staff attended the scene of the incident and after careful consideration, we have launched an independent investigation. The investigation is in its very early stages and the officer involved is assisting our inquiries as a witness.\u201d The incident took place on Upper Richmond Road in south-west London, at 12.50pm on Monday. It is the fourth car-related incident involving a member of the royal family in seven months. Mayor, a grandmother and widow, had \u201cgot lots of injuries\u201d, her daughter Fiona told the Mirror. A neighbour Simon Banks said: \u201cThere was a massive police presence around the crash. A lady was on the ground being attended to by the paramedics and a police motorcycle was lying on its side on the road nearby.\u201d The royal couple, who did not see the accident, had been travelling to attend the St George\u2019s chapel service commemorating the Order of the Garter with the Queen. In line with security procedures, the convoy \u2013 usually made up of two cars and police escorts \u2013 continued driving after the incident. It is believed that a police motorcyclist, travelling at the front of the convoy to hold back traffic, was involved. A Kensington Palace spokesman said: \u201cThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were deeply concerned and saddened to hear about the accident on Monday afternoon. Their Royal Highnesses have sent their very best wishes to Irene and her family and will stay in touch throughout every stage of her recovery.\u201d In January, the Duke of Edinburgh, 98, flipped his Land Rover after colliding with another car while driving near the Queen\u2019s Sandringham estate. He later gave up his driving licence. It was reported in March that a receptionist was still locked in an insurance battle after a police driver chauffeuring the Countess of Wessex crashed into her Peugeot in Birmingham city centre last November. Last week, reports emerged that the Duke of Kent \u2013 the Queen\u2019s 83-year-old cousin \u2013 could face a police investigation after he was involved in a car crash with a student driver in Brighton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
