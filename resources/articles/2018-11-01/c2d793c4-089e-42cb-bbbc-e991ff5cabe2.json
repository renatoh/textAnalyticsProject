The Novichok poisonings of double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, by Russian intelligence agents in Salisbury and a series of cyber-attacks allegedly directed by the Kremlin have strained ties between the UK and Russia in the last 12 months. But the British prime minister will use a traditional address at the Lord Mayor\u2019s banquet in the City of London on Monday to say the UK is \u201cready to respond in kind\u201d if there were signs of increased cooperation from Russia in the interests of international stability. May will use the speech to reflect on the Salisbury nerve agent attack and the thwarted hacking of the international chemical weapons watchdog\u2019s headquarters in The Hague by Dutch authorities, also praising the coordinated response from the west. \u201cTogether with our allies, in response to the attack in Salisbury, we coordinated the largest ever collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers, fundamentally degrading Russian intelligence capability for years to come. And our law enforcement agencies, through painstaking investigations and cooperation with our allies, produced the irrefutable evidence that enabled our Crown Prosecution Service to bring charges against those responsible. \u201cIn these actions, we have seen the impact of international unity and a collective response to these threats. We have shown that while the challenge is real, so is the collective resolve of like-minded partners to defend our values, our democracies and our people,\u201d she will tell the audience. Despite the criticism, the prime minister will say \u201cthis is not the relationship with Russia that we want\u201d. May will also announce the name of one of the UK\u2019s eight planned Type 26 frigates as HMS London in the speech."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
