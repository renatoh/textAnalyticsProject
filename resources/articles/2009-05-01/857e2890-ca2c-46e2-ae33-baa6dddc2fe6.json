At midday she went to his hostel for a pre-arranged meeting to discuss his mental state, but no one was there. When the hostel staff unlocked the door to the room, they found it empty, the bed unmade. His mobile goes straight to voicemail. Natasha is on the front line of Camden's child protection team, working from a cramped temporary office behind the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, north London, on standby to assess children brought into A&amp;E with suspicious, non-accidental injuries or signs of neglect. She is also assigned unborn children, if midwives believe that their mothers might be using drugs or drinking heavily, or if there are concerns about the parents' ability to care for the baby once it arrives. This man's desire to murder his wife and then commit suicide (which he confessed to a hospital psychiatrist) has triggered action along the safeguarding chain, and it is Natasha's responsibility to make sure he is not allowed to carry out the threat. Her inability to make contact with him is making her feel extremely uncomfortable. This is an extraordinarily challenging time to be a social worker with child protection responsibilities. The fallout from the deaths of Baby P and Victoria Climbi\u00e9 has savaged the reputation of an already much-maligned profession. \"Public vilification of social workers has a negative effect on staff and serious implications for the effectiveness, status and morale of the children's workforce as a whole,\" Lord Laming warned in his report into child protection published this spring. \"There has been a long-term appetite in the media to portray social workers in ways that are negative and undermining ... Without highly motivated and confident social workers, the reality is that more children will be exposed to harm.\" Morale in Camden is higher than elsewhere because children's services in the borough have a good reputation. But even here, the huge responsibility of the job and the prevailing climate of hostility conspire to make this a profoundly stressful occupation. For a while, Natasha has to suppress her alarm about the missing man so she can attend to another family on her books, and she makes her way swiftly on foot from the hospital, hurrying through back alleyways of the local housing estates to the one-bedroom flat that houses a young couple recently arrived from Afghanistan and their three small children. Earlier in the week, the man had his wife admitted to hospital because she had flown into a frenzy and started biting herself when the downstairs neighbours began knocking on the door to complain about the noise her children were making. The woman, heavily pregnant with her fourth child, thought they were coming to kill her husband. Inside the flat, the young mother emerges from a small side room to sit on a folded-up double bed, which takes up most of the main room. The bed is crammed next to the fridge, which is squeezed behind the crib where a small child is sleeping. If you stand in the middle of the room, there is enough room to take one small step in each direction. There is mould on the walls, which someone has tried to wipe off with a cloth, but the cloth has just spread the green dust in wide sweeps across the plaster. The mother sits with her knees folded beneath her, and listens and speaks without ever opening her eyes. A young translator has arrived to interpret; her eyes are wide with shock at the state of the mother and the flat. \"Do you still feel that you want to harm yourself?\" Natasha asks, nodding to the translator to step in. The mother replies \"no\" and falls silent, kneading her forehead with a clenched fist. When Natasha asks her to explain what happened immediately before she was hospitalised, the mother says she is terrified of the neighbours who complain constantly about the noise of the children. \"I was afraid of the arguing. And I am tired of life.\" Her husband says she has had problems with depression for several years, but he has never seen it so acute. His wife begins to cry and tells the interpreter she cannot cope with living in such crowded conditions. She has told the doctors at the hospital that if she is not rehoused within a week, she will stop eating. Natasha promises to talk to the housing department, but as she makes her way back to the street, she says social workers have very little influence on housing matters. The translator hands a payment form to Natasha for signing. \"That was a tough one,\" she says. \"You have to be professional, when really you just want to cry.\" Walking back to the hospital, Natasha says she is concerned at the mother's \"detached\" behaviour. A meeting of all the professionals concerned in the family's case is set for the following week, where the housing problems and the woman's health will be discussed, but because the father is looking after the children full-time and appears to be very competent, the case does not worry her unduly. After three years as a practising social worker in child protection, she says she is no longer easily shocked. But the disappearance of the man threatening to kill his wife is still unsettling her. She sits at her computer and begins a long process of tracking down his doctor to see whether he feels the case is serious. For three hours she is on the phone without pause, juggling calls to housing officials arguing that the family from Afghanistan need urgent rehousing, talking to midwives to find out whether the Iranian man's pregnant wife knows he is threatening to kill her, calling the hostel to see if the couple have re-emerged. She uses a headset, leaving her hands free to log all her conversations into a template on a sophisticated computer system, used by all social workers, called Framework I. An emailed report from a doctor reveals the Iranian man has been researching ways of killing his wife on the internet. Other colleagues join her to discuss what to do if the man and his wife are not traced; they share her alarm. Finally the man returns to his hostel and answers his phone. Natasha tries to establish whether his state offers cause for urgent action, or longer-term monitoring ... \"Are you able to recognise that these are just voices telling you to do things?\" she asks him, calm and sympathetic. \"What are the voices saying?\" she asks, then, after a pause: \"Kill yourself, and your wife and your baby.\" She notes down the response. \"Don't leave them alone.\" \"In the year you have been hearing these voices,\" Natasha asks, \"have you attempted to harm your wife? . . . No . . . I'm sure that you do love her and the baby. Do you think you can manage the voices? Does your wife know about the voices? Is she worried?\" Natasha makes an appointment for an emergency out-of-hours crisis team to visit the couple, and books an interpreter to be present at a hospital visit the next morning to make sure the midwives can discuss the situation with the woman, and see if she understands the risk her husband poses. It is Friday night, everyone else has left, and she gets ready to go home. \"I feel anxious for the weekend,\" she says, and draws a deep breath. \"I do feel anxious.\" Day two: Royal Free hospital Natasha reviews the red plastic folder where recent suspicious admissions to A&amp;E are logged. She wonders whether a mother's story about a 13-month-old rolling off a sofa on to a marble floor is plausible, mentally assessing whether the explanation is consistent with the injury, checking on the computer system to see whether the child or any of its siblings have previously attracted the attention of social services. It is not clear whether the mother was drunk at the time, but the injury is not serious and there are no other records to suggest this is a worrying family. More concerning is the case of a five-year-old who has fallen out of a second-floor window. His father brought him into A&amp;E with lots of cuts and bruises, but no broken bones. The child said he was climbing up to reach a toy on a shelf when he fell out, but the father has been extremely aggressive and hostile to the hospital staff, and the doctors were not entirely persuaded by the story told by the child. A check on the system shows the same child was recently taken into the emergency department of another hospital, with an injury caused by a heavy object falling on to his foot; again staff had noted the father's angry approach, objecting to x-rays being taken. Natasha says a child abuse investigation team has been booked to visit the child's home, and an appointment made for a doctor to see the child to make sure there are no historical injuries. A mental health check will also have to be booked for the father. \"It could just turn out to be a housing need - that the window is just not properly secured,\" says Natasha. But she sounds unconvinced. \"Sometimes you have to go on gut instinct. You get a sense from the parents' behaviour of whether they are trying to hide something. It is always suspicious when parents don't want to talk to the social services, when they avoid their visits, when they won't take their phone calls.\" At lunchtime, she leaves the hospital to visit two 19-year-olds who have recently brought their newborn baby home from the hospital's maternity wing. The baby was made the subject of a child protection plan before it was born, after the mother told midwives she had been smoking a lot of cannabis to dull the pain of pregnancy. Doctors were concerned not only about the impact of the drugs on the unborn child, but also about whether the mother would be able to look after it. But Natasha is not too worried by the case (four out of 10, she says, if 10 is the maximum anxiety level). A lot of her cases concern drug-addict pregnant women. She sees many babies that are born withdrawing from drugs. \"You can see them shaking when they are lying in their cribs. They can be a bit sickly - bringing up a lot of milk when they are feeding. They scratch themselves, and they have a slightly irritating high-pitched cry - they're suffering from classic withdrawal symptoms. It may take a few days for the symptoms to show, but it can be very painful for the child.\" She and the midwives must assess whether addicts are capable of looking after their children once they are born. \"Are they going to be able to prioritise financially? Is the last \u00a35 going to go on food or drugs? Is the dealer going to come to the child's house?\" Having a history of substance abuse doesn't necessarily mean they will be bad parents, she adds, as long as they are working with social services to get clean. \"If they are an active user then we would be really, really concerned by that.\" She climbs up four storeys to a clean flat where she is greeted by the new parents, who are still in their pyjamas, dazed and shattered by the persistent demands of their tiny child. Natasha is quickly reassured by their obvious affection for the child and apparent ability to cope. After a friendly 45 minutes of conversation about electricity bills, telephone wires and sleeping patterns, Natasha looks at the baby and then asks outright if either parent is still smoking cannabis. \"I've made a no-smoking rule,\" the mother says. \"Even cigarettes. I don't want smoke in the flat.\" Natasha is satisfied, and makes a note to downgrade the case from a child protection issue to the lower \"child in need\" category. It makes a positive change to be greeted in a friendly way. \"Visits like that are the best part of my job,\" she says as she walks towards the bus stop to return to the hospital, visibly relieved. Often the meetings are more confrontational. \"Not everybody wants a social worker, no matter how often you explain it's not a punitive thing and ask them to see us as supportive. A lot of people still don't want to engage with us. Particularly pregnant mothers - they just think we want to take away their babies,\" she says. \"Removal is not what we want to do, but that's not how it is perceived.\" She likes her job, and thinks the pay - which starts at around around \u00a330,000, rising to \u00a336,000 with experience - is \"decent\", but the level of antagonism she encounters is endlessly draining. \"Dealing with that hostility can be really difficult. I've been sworn at countless times, countless, countless times, been called a 'fucking bitch'. I've been given a satellite phone with an alarm button on it, which goes straight to the police, giving them my precise location. Since Baby P, it has got worse. I don't get upset any more, but I do feel deflated. I think I am genuinely putting myself out to work with these families, and sometimes I do ask myself, 'Why am I doing this?' But I don't go home and cry. I do understand that sometimes our work is intrusive.\" Day three: Children in need team, West Hampstead Andrew, a social worker with 10 years' experience, has to spend the day collecting evidence which will guide whether he recommends that three young boys, aged between four and 10, be removed from the care of their father. He feels very troubled by the looming decision. There is no evidence of physical harm to the children, just long-term, chronic neglect. Their mother is a drug addict and in prison; in her absence, the children have not attended school regularly, are badly clothed and badly fed. Despite this, Andrew believes the father loves his children. It is hard to decide what is best for the boys. In two years of working with children, he has never yet helped remove a child from its parents, and it is not something he is eager to do. But there is also the violent aggression of the father, whose threatening behaviour has caused Andrew's predecessor to hand over the case. Two family support workers (untrained social work support staff) have, over the course of a week, spent 23 hours observing conditions at the family home, to gather evidence for a possible court case. During a meeting with Andrew and a state-appointed guardian for the boys, these women describe what they have seen. \"I'm telling you now they are playing the game,\" the first, a cheerful redhead, says. She is convinced what they have witnessed has been a charade, with the father play-acting good parenting. \"Whenever they didn't want us to hear something, they put the telly on blaring. Not just in one room but in three rooms. Once we could hear a thumping noise from behind the door. We don't know what was happening.\" Social workers had told the father he needed to introduce stricter routines, and he appeared to be trying. \"But the children were put to bed in their full school uniform - trousers, shirts and jumpers,\" the second woman points out. \"The older boy was asking 'What's a bedtime?' World war three was kicking off when he was told to get to bed. I've got no doubt they got up again as soon as we left.\" The children were given just one bath over the course of the week, and the observers describe them as \"permanently grubby\". One of the older children seemed distressed and said: \"I want to go into foster care\". Another has delayed speech development (\"but he does swear well for a child of his age\"). The school reports that their behaviour is uncontrollable. One child is sleeping on the floor, another on the sofa. Their pillows are black with dirt; there is no pillow cover and no mattress cover, the women report. In every room except the kitchen, the lightbulbs have blown and not been replaced. The cupboard doors are hanging off their hinges. The children eat tinned spaghetti, frozen pizza and chips but no vegetables. The women wonder what all the benefit money is being spent on. \"Something in the house is not right - but I can't put my finger on it,\" the first woman says. \"The father is trying to show us what he thinks we need to see. But it's total chaos.\" She also sees real attachment between the father and his children. \"There is no doubt in my mind he loves his kids dearly,\" she says. Andrew takes notes, looks depressed and concludes: \"If what you've described is the best he can do, then it's a bit gloomy.\" He departs for a meeting with the father. He doesn't feel brave enough to ask if he would mind the Guardian being present. Later, he reports with cool understatement that the meeting was \"very heated\". \"He knows that he's just one step away from having the children removed. There was a lot of effing and blinding. The father has a very hostile attitude to the social services and the court.\" After just two months on the case, Andrew already feels fond of the children, and is downcast by the father's failure to improve. \"It does give me sleepless nights. Not only have they lost their mum, but now we're thinking about taking their dad away from them too. The father isn't beating them up, but the level of care is not adequate,\" he says. \"If he were beating his children, it would be easier. A case of poor parenting and neglect is much more difficult.\" He will make a recommendation to the judge, but the final decision will be taken by court. There is a chance the grandmother might take the children on, but there are doubts about her willingness to make a long-term commitment to them. \"This is the closest I've come to removing a child. Contrary to popular belief, it is very rare.\" Andrew has 29 children on his list, from 15 families. At the moment, the dilemma over what to do with these three boys is absorbing so much of his time that the other cases are pushed on to the back-burner. \"Children's social work is very hard. There aren't enough hours in the day,\" he says, eating a sandwich lunch over his computer at 4.40pm, the first moment he has been able to take a break. The phone doesn't stop ringing. As he eats, he takes another call and agrees to give up his Saturday so he can accompany some children to see their father in prison. Scanning down the list, he says the majority of the parents are on benefits, with a poor educational background - but there are exceptions. He has one family where the two small children are at private school and the father works in the City, who were put on the \"children in need\" list because their mother left them on their own one night so she could go clubbing. \"The dad was very pissed off. His attitude was: 'Why aren't you catching the real criminals?' He got his solicitor involved.\" Most of the cases involve neglect, bad parenting, drug abuse, mental health problems and domestic violence. Sex abuse and violence against children are extremely rare. \"Most people don't want to harm their children. Parenting is not rocket science, but some people just can't do it.\" Andrew hasn't yet lost his faith in humanity, but there are moments when he feels very bleak. \"99.9% of my children are absolutely fantastic. They're lovely kids. It's the parents that depress me. They don't realise the long-term effects of their neglectful behaviour.\" In the evening, before he goes home, he delivers cards to three sisters from their father, who is no longer allowed any contact with them after a long history of beating up their mother. \"May Allah bring all your wishes true. Daddy loves you,\" the cards read. The father is hoping ties can be reestablished, and Andrew has to take each child aside one by one, to discuss whether or not they want this to happen. There is real affection between the children and Andrew, who has been working with the family for two years. When he is out of earshot, the mother whispers: \"He helped me when my husband was killing me. That man saved my life.\" Day four: Duty and assessment team, West Hampstead If a school teacher, a doctor or a neighbour in the area wants to report that a child is being mistreated, their calls are dealt with by this team. The office is calm, the peace only occasionally interrupted by gently raised voices (\"If you keep on shouting at me, I will hang up.\") The duty manager, John, is making his way through 11 cases logged on the computer since yesterday. If the allegation is serious enough to be classed as a child protection matter, it must be dealt with straight away. Most cases require further investigation. First there is a call from a GP, reporting that a patient walloped her child hard over the back in the waiting room, and told staff the child was \"a bad one and should be treated like a dog\". There are questions about the mother's mental health, and a colleague is already looking into the background. Then there is the case of a father who is threatening his ex-wife over access to their children. \"He told her: 'Things have changed, I'm packing shooters.' Does that mean guns?\" John wonders. \"It says here he's a crackhead. The mother is very worried.\" Each case that is taken on will generate at least 150 pages of documentation, and staff resent the paperwork. Every call made, every letter sent, every fax dispatched has to be noted in the system. \"It does mean there's not enough time left to spend with the family,\" John says. Andrew agrees the balance is wrong. \"If you ask any social worker, the one thing they would like to change would be to get rid of the paperwork. If the government doesn't sort this out, I can't see myself sticking at the job for another 10 years. We spend something like 80% of our time at the computer.\" Staff turnover is a problem here, as it is across the country. \"There is a huge shortage of social workers in London. You burn out quite quickly,\" a team manager says. Some of the shortfall is made up by employing people from South Africa, Europe, Australia and the US. \"Unfortunately there is an issue about the quality of the training here. It's reasonable to say that your best students aren't flocking towards social work degrees. The status of the profession has dropped,\" he says. \"Abroad it is more on a par with teaching, but here it is seen as below that. Recruitment is one of our biggest challenges.\" Day five: Looked-after children team, Crowndale centre, Camden Three members of the team are having a polite disagreement about whether a care order should be lifted, allowing four children to have normal contact with their father. Three years ago, the children were briefly taken into foster care because their father's behaviour was deemed unacceptably dangerous, and their mother was judged incapable of protecting them. He had set fire to their flat, was regularly beating her; there were death threats and an incident with a dog being killed. Since then the children have been reunited with their mother, but the father is not allowed to visit, and rare meetings between him and his children have to be supervised by social workers. Parental responsibility for the children is shared between the borough and the mother. Madeleine, a young social worker from Texas, newly assigned to the case, says the father's mental health has improved, and he is taking drugs to control his schizophrenia. She thinks perhaps it's time for the restrictions on normal family life to be removed. \"Over my dead body would that order be lifted,\" remarks a colleague, who was in charge of the case when the original crisis erupted. A meeting with the four children, both parents, representatives from their school, social workers and an independent review officer is held in a large conference room. For the duration of the discussions, the youngest child, aged five, plays with plastic cups on the floor, serving invisible cups of tea to the adults around the table. The father, in a purple shirt and waistcoat, sunglasses tucked into his collar, listens approvingly as the teachers outline the children's positive school reports. But he is irritated at the presence of an unfamiliar locum social worker, and impatient with the protracted process of regaining contact with his children. \"This is a new social worker,\" he complains. \"She doesn't know anything.\" \"Can I say something?\" the 11-year-old child asks, before telling the room: \"I don't really like social services.\" There is awkward laughter from staff. \"It will be better for my dad if he is around us. When he is around us he is mostly happy.\" A new assessment of the family is ordered, and the family is asked to return in June. There is ill-concealed frustration on all sides of the table. Madeleine goes to meet another social worker and a psychiatrist to discuss the mental health of a 15-year-old boy, the son of a heroin addict, who has been looked after in a succession of foster homes and care homes since he was seven. The boy hates his new care home, and Madeleine wants to see whether it might be time to try to find him a new foster family. The news is not good. The woman in charge of finding placements joins the meeting and describes the boy as \"unfosterable\". His situation has become more complicated since he made an allegation of sexual abuse against a care home worker; an investigation was conducted and the claim ruled unfounded. The child is refusing to go to school and locks himself in his room all day. Care home staff have tried turning off the power supply to his room during school hours, so he can't play computer games - without success. \"His school reckoned he was Cambridge material,\" the psychiatrist says, but adds that the boy has refused to attend classes since September and is getting severely behind. His behaviour is increasingly disturbed. He emptied the cutlery drawer into the microwave and turned it on, knowing it would explode. He has been violent towards staff, and has broken things in his room. Attempts to organise private tuition have foundered because the boy missed his appointments. The psychiatrist has interviewed the boy in the private care home where he is currently housed, and came away despondent. \"I feel very, very stuck ...\" he says sadly. \"This is a sensitive, awkward boy who feels very, very bad about himself. He doesn't feel cared about.\" The group has a long discussion about what might be best. There is an unspoken sense that this is a case where corporate parenting has not worked well. The placements manager, who has known the child for many years and appears fond of him, feels downcast about the way things have turned out. \"It would have been much cheaper to send him to Eton,\" she says. \u2022 All names have been changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
