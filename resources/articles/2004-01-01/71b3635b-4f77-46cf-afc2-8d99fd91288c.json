Henry, the former Wales and Lions coach who took over from John Mitchell last month after the All Blacks failed to win the World Cup, has his eye on the Northampton flanker Andrew Blowers, the Wasps prop Craig Dowd and the Saracens back rower Taine Randell, as well as the Saints' wing Bruce Reihana and the Leicester centre Daryl Gibson. \"We have lost a lot of guys in recent years,\" said Henry. \"We need some old heads in our Super 12 sides. Senior players do a tremendous amount for the development of a nation's rugby talent and we have a number playing in Europe and Japan: if any of them want to come home, I will give them every encouragement.\" The former New Zealand scrum-half Mark Robinson is at Northampton and the centre Mark Mayerhofler is with Newcastle, the full-back Christian Cullen and the centre Paul Steinmetz are playing in Ireland, and the former New Zealand captain Todd Blackadder is with Edinburgh. In addition, several New Zealand internationals are earning their livings in Japan with the second-row forward Troy Flavell, who was banned for four weeks for a crude challenge on Richard Hill during the friendly between England and the New Zealand Barbarians last month, considering joining them. \"I want Troy to stay here,\" said Henry. \"He is a rare player who can play in the second and back rows, and we cannot afford to lose any more seasoned players abroad. We have to develop our depth.\" Henry was speaking on the eve of a world conference being held until Thursday in Auckland, where the leading coaches and administrators will be discussing the state of the sport in the company of referees and players. \"I will be in close contact with our five Super 12 coaches in the coming months and there will be a renewed emphasis on forward play,\" Henry added. \"I appreciate that the conditions we play under are firmer than those in Europe, but we need to look at the bigger picture.\" Henry wants to make sure that the conditions favour the All Blacks when they play England in the first of two Tests, in Dunedin on June 12, by switching from a evening kick-off, which suits British television, to the afternoon which would mean a 4am BST start. \"At that time of year, in the middle of winter in the south, the chances are the conditions will be better in the afternoon than at night,\" he said. \"There is no doubt that late kick-offs affect the quality of rugby, but I acknowledge that we will have to hold discussions with the broadcasters.\" Wales's Steve Hansen and Northampton's Wayne Smith are expected to be offered contracts next month as Henry's assistant coaches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
