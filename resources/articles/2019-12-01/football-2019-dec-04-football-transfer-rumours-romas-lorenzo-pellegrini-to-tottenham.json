Christian Eriksen, for example, still wants out, and his chairman, Daniel Levy, is happy to assist in that ambition, with Manchester United among possible suitors. The Evening Standard reports that Levy is pushing for the Dane\u2019s sale in January \u2013 for less than \u00a340m if necessary \u2013 to forestall the risk of Eriksen going for free when his contract runs out in the summer. So who would come into Spurs\u2019 midfield in his stead? On this The Mill has more nos to churn than yeses. Nemanja Matic is a no-no, according to the Manchester Evening News. So too is Bruno Fernandes, due to the whopping \u00a385m release clause on the Sporting midfielder. So enter Roma\u2019s Lorenzo Pellegrini who, according to Calciomercato, is firmly on Tottenham\u2019s shopping list. Oh, and in defence, Spurs have their eye on the young Norwich centre-back Ben Godfrey. Across north London, Marcelino is the latest name to be crowbarred into the managerial frame at Arsenal. The former Valencia head coach, without a club since being ushered out the Mestalla doors in September, has been contacted by Arsenal about the position, according to reports in Spain, though the Gunners may face competition from Everton should Marco Silva\u2019s tenuous grasp on his job be loosened altogether. Talking of Everton, they\u2019re keen on signing the 16-year-old Portuguese sensation Matchoi Bobo Djal\u00f3. The Pacos de Ferreira winger became the youngest player to appear in Portugal\u2019s top-flight earlier this season and has also attracted the interest of Southampton, Newcastle and Juventus. With Edinson Cavani\u2019s happiest days at Paris Saint-Germain seemingly now behind him, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are keen to revive an interest in the Uruguay forward that they first displayed in 2015. Mundo Deportivo says that, with Mauro Icardi now above Cavani in PSG\u2019s pecking order and Diego Simeone still inclined to fill an Antoine Griezmann-sized hole in his attack, such a move could fit for both player and club. Leicester have been linked with a \u00a330m swoop for Burnley\u2019s Dwight McNeill as Brendan Rodgers looks to further strengthen his high-flying squad but the Clarets\u2019 chairman Mike Garlick isn\u2019t having a bar of it. \u201cOne thing we won\u2019t be looking to do is put everything we\u2019ve achieved at risk by selling any of our key players,\u201d Garlick sniffed in his programme notes for Tuesday night\u2019s defeat by Manchester City. Wolves, Manchester United and Juventus have also been linked with the in-form winger. And in a reassuring display of interest in the non-league game, Enfield Town\u2019s Muhammadu Faal \u2013 second cousin of Joe Gomez, no less \u2013 is on several Premier League clubs\u2019 radars. The Sun reports that the striker, who has scored 18 goals in 19 games for the Isthmian Premier Division side, is being sized up by Norwich, Watford, Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Sheffield United."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
