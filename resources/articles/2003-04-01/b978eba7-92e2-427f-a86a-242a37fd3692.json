But more importantly, it gives us an opportunity to consider and debate collectively the key challenges that we all face in taking forward higher education. And I believe we need to move forward in a way that recognises our traditions and values while at the same time taking every opportunity to adapt organically to new challenges. What I want to do over the next 30 minutes is to focus on what I see as three key strategic developments: the government's white paper on The Future of Higher Education; the grant letter covering higher education funding and delivery to 2005-06; and, finally our consultation document on the strategic development of higher education in the period 2003-08. That will give us another 20 minutes for questions and discussion. The challenge we are all facing is how we can achieve and sustain excellence in an age of uncertainty. The future we face will be uncertain as the full impact of globalisation sweeps across the world. And higher education will, like any knowledge organisation, be subject to the challenges and opportunities of globalisation. So what we need to do is ensure we are able to achieve and sustain excellence in a world where there will be an ever increasing demand for higher education from the world's population but ever changing demands for the delivery and provision of that demand. The white paper - The Future of Higher Education Let me turn initially to the white paper. I think it was the distinguished commentator on higher education, Professor Martin Trow, who said back in the early 1990s that when he received a copy of the 1991 white paper on higher education, he glanced through the document at speed and then wondered if all he had between its red covers was an executive summary. For Trow, the government's thinking about the ending of the binary line and creation of a single funding framework for higher education lacked a certain measure of analysis and detail that he might have expected as we bounded into the age of mass higher education. I doubt he could make the same comments about the 2003 white paper. At 105 pages it is certainly not short on detail. In one sense the white paper represents unfinished business from Lord Dearing's report in 1997. You will recall that Ron and his committee thought at the time that we would probably need another look at higher education some five years or so after his report. So the white paper is timely. But it is also a bold statement about a new sense of direction for higher education. I very much welcome the white paper's acknowledgement of the fact that our universities and colleges are a great success story. We are moving forward from a position of strength. But in a competitive and volatile global environment we need to seize every opportunity to build on our individual and collective strengths to ensure that we can achieve and sustain excellence in all aspects of our teaching, research and knowledge transfer. Where I think the white paper could have been stronger is on the relationship between higher education and lifelong learning. People will move in and out of higher education on a full-time and part-time basis throughout their lives and we need to ensure that we are sufficiently flexible in the way we deliver higher education to meet those needs. That really is very important. We need to put alongside that notion of lifelong learning a real sense of educational opportunity and progression, so that we see clear progression routes into and through higher education across an individual's lifetime. My vision, if you like, is that a student of any age can get a taste for higher education perhaps by doing an evening class, an adult learning class, a vocational course, or whatever it might be, at a local institution and, from that point on, there is a natural and seamless pathway through a range of higher education qualifications that could ultimately lead to a PhD in a research strong university. I welcome the confidence that the government has in the ability of our sector to deliver excellence across the full range of our activities, to promote both economic competitiveness and social inclusion. And I believe that the government's determination to develop in partnership a long-term strategy for investment and reform does at the very least give us a platform for building on past and current success. I can accept that not every part of the white paper will be to the liking of every person here today. But I think it does need to be acknowledged, if not fully accepted, that we are engaged in a debate with a government that quite clearly views our universities and colleges as the key institutions of the knowledge economy and knowledge society. Since the white paper was published in January, I have been to a great many meetings with colleagues in the sector. And as you would expect we have had many conversations about the direction and speed of change for higher education that could evolve from the white paper. The one conversation that sticks in my mind was with a vice-chancellor who had lived through the period of the so-called 'efficiency gains' of the substantive part of the 1990s. Life was awful for many in higher education at that time. But things have improved in terms of the investment in higher education; and if we are careful and can make our case with evidence, then we can sustain that momentum, even though I am realistic enough to acknowledge we have a long way to go. The long-term investment by the government described in the white paper may not be what many colleagues here today feel is sufficient to sustain excellence across the sector - however it is allocated. But it does, I believe, give out the message that there should be no turning back to the cuts of the '80s and '90s. I welcome and support strongly the opportunity the white paper gives us to re-invent the vocation of higher education and re-balance the teaching vocation with the research vocation. We have all been working extremely hard over the past 10 years to find ways of recognising and rewarding high quality teaching. Far too often the debate about teaching quality enhancement has been overshadowed by the furore surrounding the 'teaching quality battles'. I really do believe we have now found a way forward on quality assurance, and in no small measure that is a tribute to colleagues in the sector who have worked creatively with the Quality Assurance Agency and the funding bodies to find a workable and purposeful solution. And I want to pay tribute to the work of Sir Ron Cooke who has over the past two years encouraged, supported and led the crusade to find a way forward that would be acceptable to all the stakeholders in higher education. I am personally particularly grateful to Ron for the contribution he has made to the plans for the establishment of the new Academy for Learning and Teaching. And I also wish to thank publicly Ron's colleagues on the Teaching Quality Enhancement Committee. Given the range of constituencies that all have a legitimate and valued voice in the quality enhancement of teaching, I know it was no mean task to find an acceptable way forward. I hope we can collectively find the mechanisms and funding to ensure that the new Academy becomes a reality. I know there is unfinished business here; in particular the student survey, which we are committed to making robust and reliable through piloting and development work. We need to find effective ways of incentivising teaching excellence, through a range of measures including the Centres for Teaching Excellence. We will also take forward the exciting agenda of developing innovative approaches to learning and teaching to meet the changing needs of students and employers. I will return to these points later. Office for Fair Access I cannot let this opportunity pass without saying a few words about the debate on the 'Access Regulator'. To be slightly - but only slightly - off message for the moment, I must say that I thought the Guardian Higher Education section on 1 April was simply priceless in its exclusive on the naming of the regulator. Carole Caplin was not, I must confess, the name that immediately came to mind in the context of the regulator. To go back on-message. We now have the publication from the government on 'Widening participation in higher education' which sets out the plans for establishing the new Office for Fair Access. I am sure everyone here today will have noted that within the government's proposals, 'An individual university's admission policies and procedures will be outside the remit of the access agreement and the Office for Fair Access'. And I think this statement will be broadly welcomed across the sector. We support the proposal that Professor Stephen Schwartz should identify and disseminate good practice in admissions. And of course he will have the benefit of building on the excellent work from Universities UK and others, in the recently published report 'Fair Enough'. Within the Council we have always expected a role that included providing support for the Office for Fair Access. Therefore I welcome the confirmation by the government. As the publication acknowledges, some of the government's proposals will be subject to legislation and therefore may be subject to amendment before implementation. And the document is of course out for consultation. I do hope that the sector will respond positively to this invitation. And of course the HEFCE Board will have a view on the details of the consultation document. We broadly welcome the more constructive approach now set out in the report's proposals, but retain some concerns about how the regulator will relate to the HEFCE Board - and to me as Accounting Officer. Funding settlement to 2005-06 Let me now turn to the funding settlement in the three-year period from 2003-04. Overall, I believe this is a favourable settlement. For the year 2003-04, funding for research has increased by 10.9 per cent. The increase in the resource for teaching is more modest at 3.8 per cent. One of the main features of the grant allocation is the \u00a3265 million for widening access and improving retention which recognises more fully the additional costs of providing for students who are most at risk of dropping out. Although overall teaching grant contributes to the additional costs of providing for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, or who are most at risk of dropping out, the method for calculating the grant has not previously sufficiently recognised these costs. And there are substantial increases in capital funds for teaching, research and information technology. These funds will help to redress past under-investment in infrastructure. The \u00a3364 million allocated for capital in the financial year 2003-04 will rise to \u00a3649 million by 2005-06. Undoubtedly, the one area that has given rise to the greatest concern is the allocation of funds for research. The challenge of the white paper is to make best use of our grant from the government to ensure that research funding is allocated, organised and managed effectively. The funding letter made clear that the secretary of state wished to see more discrimination between the best research departments in advance of the next research assessment exercise. And as you will be aware, the secretary of state followed up the grant letter with a further letter to my chairman, David Young, in late February this year. We were requested to allocate \u00a320 million in 2003-04 to the best research departments rated 5* in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise. And we had to meet this objective within the existing grant. The method for allocating the research funds is set out in detail in the recurrent grant circular published in March so I do not propose today to go over well-trodden ground. If we start with the premise that we want to identify and reward research excellence, then we are by logic moving from a position in which we start by funding adequately the strongest departments and then work our way down the list until we exhaust all the available funding. This approach has had significant funding consequences particularly for the grade 4 and grade 3a departments. The reality is that we have to operate within a finite funding envelope and the Council has had to take some difficult decisions within a range of competing priorities. I think the issue here is really one of overall levels of public funding for research. While I believe that the overall settlement for higher education is a good one, it does not provide sufficient funding to fund at previous rates all research in all departments across England. It would also be unrealistic, I believe, to expect public funding in the future to meet all expectations. Therefore, our funding policy is necessarily selective, with the highest units of resource being targeted at research excellence. Not to do so would weaken our nation's overall research base and global competitiveness. We will, of course, continue to argue for additional funding for research in the next Spending Review. I think there has been general support for our decision to provide \u00a320 million as a capability fund, to support research in emerging subject areas where the research base is currently not as strong as in more established subjects. The capability fund will operate at least for the three-year period from 2003-04 to 2005-06. I hope that this commitment will provide a degree of continuity and confidence for planning purposes. You will have seen from our grant announcement that we have allocated just under 20,000 additional student places in 2003-04. If the government is serious about moving towards a 50 per cent participation rate by the end of the decade then we shall need to move towards a significant expansion of student numbers. This may be after the next Spending Review settlement. I am not complaining too hard about this because at the moment, as you know, developing demand for higher education among students is very dependent upon improving achievement rates at 16 to 18. At the moment the sector is more or less in equilibrium in terms of supply and demand. So, if we had more places, significantly more places, I am not convinced that we could fill them. As we move forward, I hope that we will see both our policies at the Council and the government policies for improvement in performance in schools, delivering more students at 16 plus who are able to participate in higher education courses. We estimate that to meet the government target we shall need an expansion of at least 350,000 places by the end of the decade. And it is essential that this growth is fully funded. Without it the sector cannot meet the 50 per cent target, nor have the flexibility to plan for the present latent demand in those parts of the country where there is a lack of provision, whether Cumbria or Cornwall, Swindon or Doncaster, Ipswich or Peterborough. These issues will need to be addressed in the Government's next Spending Review. HEFCE Strategic Plan 2003-08 Let me now turn to our draft strategic plan which was launched last month and is out for consultation until 27 May. It is not at all surprising that there is a degree of symmetry between the government's overarching vision and the Council's strategic approach to developing and sustaining excellence throughout our higher education system. The symmetry is not surprising as there is common ground in all modern economies and societies about the challenges of globalisation, and the impact of the knowledge economy and knowledge society. We all know the challenges we face. The issue is how we respond strategically to these challenges. How we move as a sector to meet the challenges of globalisation and grow stronger as a result is no mean task. Our strategic plan will provide a funding framework within which our universities and colleges have an opportunity to build on their chosen areas of strength, and work in collaboration with other providers, so that the sector as a whole continues to thrive. We are, I believe, at a defining point for higher education. How we fund, manage and deliver higher education over this decade will have a profound effect on our ability as a higher education sector to meet the challenges of globalisation and opportunities of a culture of lifelong learning. Our aim is to foster and reward world-class provision across the full range of activities in higher education. As I mentioned earlier, perhaps the greatest challenge we face is to the traditional concept of higher education. Lifelong learning is turning education from a single life episode to a lifelong opportunity for personal development. I am proud of the achievements of our universities and colleges. But past success will not deliver the solutions for tomorrow's world. We need to focus on options that will deliver the future rather than tinkering with structures that have delivered the past. I believe that the combination of the White paper and our strategic plan offers an enviable agenda for the future of higher education in this country. The challenge is to turn the vision into a reality. The draft strategic plan that we shall be discussing in detail in the workshop sessions today and tomorrow deliberately does not go into detail about the programmes of work we shall need to develop in partnership, and after consultation, with the sector and then put into effect. I should stress that our new integrated approach to the allocation of funding in all four core areas should be viewed as an organic development from our present funding arrangements. As we develop and implement the strategic plan, I think we do need to ground our thinking and funding in a geographical context and framework. We do need to think about the regional impact of our policies. This has implications for the continued development of a creative relationship between the Council, universities and colleges, and the Regional Development Agencies. This is something that you may wish to pick up and explore in the workshop discussions. I think it will be helpful if I take this opportunity to remind colleagues of the key questions within which we are asking respondents to frame their comments on the draft plan. There are five key questions: \u00b7 Do you endorse the vision and the broad strategic direction - and if not, what elements cause you concern and why? \u00b7 Viewed as five-year strategy, is this a sound and realistic plan to guide the development of the English higher education sector, and does it contain the right key themes and elements? \u00b7 What are the main unresolved issues and associated risks in relation to implementing the plan, and are the Council and the sector together adequately prepared to deal with these? \u00b7 Do you endorse our proposal to develop a funding approach that supports institutions in building on chosen areas of strength and encourages collaboration? \u00b7 Do you have comments on other specific elements of the strategic plan? The core of the argument in the strategic plan is that individual universities and colleges will have to recognise that they cannot all meet the full range of customer and stakeholder needs. They must work to build on their chosen areas of strength, and in collaboration with other providers, so that the sector as a whole continues to deliver all that is required of it. Tomorrow's university or college will need to be increasingly diverse, flexible and adaptable. We all want to ensure that higher education is at the heart of a truly competitive knowledge-based economy and an open inclusive society. Through our funding support, we will help to develop a system where excellence in teaching and knowledge transfer is as highly regarded as excellence in research. We will support innovative ways of delivering lifelong learning, both traditionally and through new technologies. We will support institutions that reach out beyond their traditional student base to encourage those who can benefit from higher education to do so. We will support diversity, collaboration and complementary patterns of working in the drive to improve quality. Let us now look at the four core strategic aims and three cross-cutting themes. While I do not want to go into each in detail I do want to spend a little time walking through the key features of each section. Widening participation and fair access I am sure that some of you will have seen the press coverage given to the draft key performance targets on widening participation and fair access. I should say that we have discussed these draft targets with colleagues at the DfES. And I should emphasise that the targets are genuinely for consultation. Additionally, I should emphasise that we are not in the business of setting quotas or targets for individual universities or colleges. We fully expect to review the targets in the light of the consultation, and in the light of the government's document on 'Widening participation in higher education'. From our perspective, we see widening and increasing participation as a permanent goal for the higher education sector. We regard delivering, with others, the Government's target for increased participation as the first step in a longer campaign of developing bespoke education to meet the needs of individual learners, including through vocational qualifications and workplace learning. In our review of funding for teaching, we are examining our funding for part-time and continuing education, funding for completed modules, and funding for flexible modes of delivery. This is an area of the strategic plan where we really need to work creatively in partnership with other stakeholders such as the Regional Development Agencies, and the Learning and Skills Council. We also need to work in partnership with the DfES and the Aimhigher initiative, to increase demand for higher education. While we may wish to set regional targets for growth it is also the case that as a funding council we do not have planning powers, which will impact on our ability to direct funding and growth in student numbers. We plan to make available additional funding for institutions that have a distinctive mission in this area, and a correspondingly large proportion of students from non-traditional backgrounds. Enhancing excellence in learning and teaching Learning and teaching are at the heart of higher education. They are a core activity for all institutions, and feature strongly in the public perception of the sector's role and achievements. Students already see themselves as customers as well as learners and as the fee levels increase they will increasingly feel themselves entitled to agreed standards of provision, and to full information about the quality of what is provided. In this part of the strategic plan we are trying to address a number of inter-related themes. We want to support the vocation of teaching. There should be other routes to prestige than through the research vocation route. The blend of initiatives to deliver quality assurance and quality enhancement will support our objectives. In consultation with the sector we will fund a significant number of Centres of Excellence in Teaching. Establishing the centres will both reward demonstrable excellence and be an investment in developing effective pedagogy that reflects new modes of teaching and learning, and the growing diversity of learner needs. As I mentioned earlier, we do see the proposed new Academy for Learning and Teaching as a positive and constructive part of our plans to support quality enhancement. The Bologna Process This is an opportune moment to say a few words about the Bologna Process. The Bologna declaration may well have widespread implications for the future of UK higher education and quality standards within a European perspective. For our part, we shall wish to work with the sector and other partners to assess the implications of major European initiatives particularly in respect of any discussions that relate to a more co-ordinated Europe-wide system of quality assurance for the UK. I think that what we really need to do as a matter of some urgency is work towards a coherent set of policy objectives and key principles that could guide us in our future engagement with Europe, and indeed the Bologna Process. We do need to engage collectively and pro-actively with the Bologna Process and other European initiatives and I would prefer to move forward on the basis of purposeful engagement in the context of clear policy objectives. Enhancing excellence in research We are seeking to develop a funding policy that supports and rewards world-class research, encourages effective collaboration, and provides capacity for developing and extending research capability in new areas of work. We shall shortly be having a presentation by Sir Gareth Roberts on the review of the RAE. I am personally immensely grateful to Gareth and his steering group for the commitment and energy they devoted to the task. We are committed to collaborating with other funders to enable the research base to respond positively to the changing face of research. It is a priority for us to ensure that funders work closely together so that we do not pull the research base in different directions. Sustaining our research base against global competition means we must recognise and support truly excellent research financially, and foster effective collaboration. We will develop a selective funding system that allocates our grant primarily by reference to robust assessments of research excellence and also works to maintain and develop the research infrastructure. And as I mentioned earlier but it is worth repeating, we have earmarked \u00a320 million for a capability fund to support research in emerging subject areas. Enhancing the contribution of higher education to the economy and society As global competition increases, so does the importance of ensuring that the knowledge that HEIs create and accumulate is applied for the economic and social benefit of all, and especially within their surrounding communities. In this section of the strategic plan we set out our plans to build our existing support for HEIs' activity in this field into the permanent targeted funding stream. The purpose of the funding arrangements proposed are to support and encourage closer collaboration between our universities and colleges and the potential users of their knowledge, expertise and facilities. Within the next phase of the Higher Education Innovation Fund we will support up to 20 new Knowledge Exchanges, focused on institutions that are already centres of excellent practice in both knowledge transfer and skills development. Building on institutions' strengths We believe that the pressures for change to which our strategy responds are likely to lead over time to the development of a higher education sector which is significantly different - in its structure, organisation and approach - to what we see now. Universities and colleges need to consider now how they will respond, individually and collectively, to the challenges that change of this order will present. Our vision is for a higher education sector in which institutions are at once more diverse and increasingly interconnected. We aim to support institutions in focusing on their strengths while building new partnerships based on complementary missions. We aim to help institutions, and the sector as a whole, to respond effectively to global competition, and to become more firmly grounded in the needs of their regional economies and communities. The outcome should be a sector working to common standards of excellence to achieve shared goals across a wide range of activity. We believe that our approach to funding will enable and encourage institutions to develop distinctive missions building on their areas of relative strength. It will enable them to choose the areas in which they plan to achieve particular excellence - within a coherent national framework. We will make available additional funding beyond our core grant in all the strategic areas, allocated in response to the institutions' own aims and mission. We aim over the planning period to build up this funding to the point where substantial additional rewards are accessible to institutions achieving particular excellence under any of the aims. I think there is some measure of concern about our plans to fund by mission. In part I think this is based on a misunderstanding of our intentions. We are actually trying to protect the strengths that diversity brings to our higher education system. I think the English - and I do mean the English - do have a genius for turning diversity into hierarchy, and I am not sure what we can do about that to be quite honest. And to lay another myth to rest - we are not about to impose the 'Wisconsin' model on English higher education. But I do think we need to be open to different models of funding and structures. I have spoken in other places about opening a debate around the metaphor of funding that is based on a hub, spoke and rim. I have a figurative mind so this helps me at least to project an image of how we can bring together systemically the strengths of individual institutions to support a world-class system of higher education in England. I should emphasise that I am not talking about imposing a new model or plan for higher education. But really I want to use the hub, spoke and rim image to allow us to visualise a network of relationships: a network that is not hierarchical but dependent on each part of the network performing to the highest possible standards. The hub institution (whether for teaching, research, knowledge transfer or widening participation) holds that place in the network because it has a particular strength in that area of provision. The connectivity of the range of institutions is fuelled by collaborative arrangements that are mutually supportive. Developing leadership, governance and management I know that this area of development did invoke a reasonable degree of angst at last year's conference. But I really do feel we have made significant progress on two fronts: firstly, in making more transparent the issues for debate; and secondly, in our support for the sector's own strategic framework for leadership development through a new leadership foundation. The development of the people who work in higher education underpins the delivery of all our key objectives. It will not be long before we have to put forward our evidence to the next Spending Review. And evidence of the efficient and effective use of funds for staff investment can only help our case. At the heart of the strategic plan is the message that we want to build a new relationship with our universities and colleges. And we wish to reduce the administrative burden on the sector by moving away from an audit-focused accountability relationship towards helping the sector to build stakeholder confidence through visible good practice. Excellence in delivery: organisational development within HEFCE The final section of the strategic plan is about my own organisation and our performance. Our strategy has the objective of supporting the sector in a culture of continuous improvement, so it is essential that we not only hold up a mirror to our own practice but also seek to benchmark our practice and performance. As the strategic plan sets out, we are to be assessed by the European Foundation for Quality Management. And as you will be aware we do make public the results of the MORI survey which looks at communications and relations between the Council and the sector. We shall be publishing the results of the most recent survey. I think we can take heart from the most recent survey results. But we are not complacent and we shall look carefully at those areas where we can do even better. Conclusion This is a particularly important conference both for the Council and the sector. We face a great many challenges but the White paper and the funding settlement offer many opportunities. If we work together creatively and purposively we can maintain and enhance our world-class reputation. Our strategic plan is designed to achieve that objective. The purpose of the workshop sessions is to explore both the conceptual and practical consequences of our plans. I very much look forward to hearing what you have to say about our strategic plan. We can only make it better if we hear what you have to say, and listen and act upon your advice. I shall end with a quote from the distinguished American commentator Sheldon Rothblatt. In his essay on higher education, based on a series of intellectual voyages around John Henry Newman's 'Idea of a University', Sheldon wrote: \"For many centuries universities have exercised a disconcerting aesthetic and moral hold on the imagination of European and American societies. Universities' histories are full of promise, full of disappointments, but always, like the open ovals of the seventeenth-century astronomers, pointing beyond themselves. The result resembles the one described by Thucydides as he pondered the essence of his native Attica. Athens, reflected the exiled narrator, was born to have no rest. It would also give none to others.\" Some would say that HEFCE was born to have no rest; and it would give none to others. Our collective task is to deliver the future for higher education. We should always start with a vision. This is a task as daunting as it is inspiring. We should settle for nothing less.
