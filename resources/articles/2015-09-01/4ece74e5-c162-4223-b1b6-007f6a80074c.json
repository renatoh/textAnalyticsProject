That\u2019s all for now. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to check back later for a full match report. Third set: Azarenka 4-6 Halep An errant Azarenka groundstroke early in a rally \u2013 her 16th unforced error of the set to Halep\u2019s four \u2013 moves the world No2 within three points of the match. Vika strikes back to win the next two points on a pair of Halep errors to level the score at 30-all. Now Halep hits a scorching forehand winner to bring it to match point. The crowd on Ashe swells. Halep steps to the line. Good serve down the middle and Halep lets out a shriek when Azarenka sprays a forehand wide on the fourth shot of the rally. The match is over and Simona Halep is through to the US Open semi-finals for the first time with a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 victory. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I found the power to win this match,\u201d Halep says to ESPN\u2019s Pat Shriver during the on-court interview. Third set: Azarenka 4-5 Halep* (*denotes next server) Two quick points for Halep to put Azarenka behind love-30 and move the world No2 within two points of the semi-finals. Vika takes the ball early for a winner to close it to 15-30, then a missed forehand by Halep makes it 30-all. Powerful backhand winner by Azarenka makes it 40-30 and a winner at the net off a thudding serve gives her the game. Halep will now serve for the match. Third set: *Azarenka 3-5 Halep (*denotes next server) Azarenka with two quick points on Halep\u2019s serve, but the Romanian strikes right back with a backhand winner from the baseline followed by an Azarenka error to bring it to 30-all. A third straight point gives Halep game point, but Vika fights back with a winner to bring it to deuce. Still, Halep fights through for the hold and Azarenka will serve to stay in the tournament. Third set: Azarenka 3-4 Halep* (*denotes next server) Vika faults while serving at 30-15 and Halep pounces on the 79mph second serve to crunch a forehand winner up the line. A half-chance for Halep here at 30-all. Next a 21-shot rally ends when Halep misses a cross-court forehand long. A game point for Azarenka, but Halep brings it to deuce with a thunderous forehand which she punctuates with a fist pump. A double fault by Halep gives Azarenka another game point, but she overcooks another forehand and it\u2019s back to deuce. Now a Vika error will give Halep at look at a break point, and the world No2 converts when it\u2019s Azarenka who blinks first during a high-quality baseline volley. A mishit backhand sails wide and it\u2019s the Romanian in the driver\u2019s seat after the changeover when she serves for a 5-3 lead. Third set: *Azarenka 3-3 Halep (*denotes next server) A very easy hold for Halep, whose serve is locked in. Both players look rejuvenated from the break and are really going for it. Azarenka to serve now for a 4-3 lead with new balls. Third set: Azarenka 3-2 Halep* (*denotes next server) Two quick points by Azarenka, then a nicely placed touch volley to move ahead 40-love. Three game points. A double fault by Vika \u2013 her second of the set and fifth of the match \u2013 makes it 40-15. But Azarenka charges the net on the next point and forces Halep into an error. Easy hold. Looks like we\u2019re about to resume here on Ashe. Halep closed out the hold and Azarenka will serve at 2-2 in the third. The Wawrinka-Anderson quarter-final has been moved to Armstrong. That match won\u2019t start before 6. Federer-Gasquet still on Ashe for 7. The rain is still coming down in Flushing Meadows. While we\u2019re waiting, take a minute to appreciate how much a better day you\u2019re having than James Blake, who was on his way to the grounds today when he was, shall we say, sidetracked. \u201cLet\u2019s send them to the locker room,\u201d tournament referee Brian Earley says. \u201cThey said it\u2019s only going to get heavier.\u201d Play now suspended. Stay with us and we\u2019ll keep you updated on the latest from the grounds. One big question: will the third men\u2019s quarter-final between Stan Wawrinka and Kevin Anderson, scheduled for next on Ashe in the day-session finale, be moved to Armstrong? Third set: Azarenka 2-1, 15-40 Halep* (*currently serving) The lights have been turned on \u2013 finally! \u2013 and the rain is coming down. They get a few points in with Halep moving ahead 30-15, but tournament referee Brian Earley is on the court with walkie-talkie in hand. Looks like the players want to finish the game and they do play one more point, which goes to Halep, before Earley and the chair umpire halt play for weather. Now it appears Earley is trying to determine whether to keep the players on court or to send them back to the locker room. Third set: Azarenka 2-1 Halep* (*denotes next server) Just when Azarenka had conjured her best tennis and appeared poised for a finishing kick, Halep rattles off the first two points on her serve. Vika with a gorgeous volley brings it to 15-40, but a Halep winner gives her two dooks at a break point. Azarenka saves them both, but a deep, penetrating groundstroke by Halep lands right on the line and flummoxes Vika and Halep will have a third break point. Vika saves that too, but minutes later can\u2019t save a fourth, giving the break to Halep with an unforced error. Halep now 5-for-17 on break points compared to 5-for-5 for Azarenka. Third set: *Azarenka 2-0 Halep (*denotes next server) At 30-30, a drop-shot winner by Azarenka gives Vika a break-point chance. Halep faults, then musters just a 66mph second serve that Azarenka pounces on, getting even in the rally before forcing Halep into an error off the forehand side. It\u2019s Vika, break point down just moments ago, who draws first blood in the decider. Third set: Azarenka 1-0 Halep* (*denotes next server) Halep winner followed by a double fault by Azarenka. Love-30. Halep then nets a forehand, but Azarenka does the same on the next point to earn a pair of break chances early in the third. She saves both off her second serve: the first with a backhand winner from the middle of the court to cap a lengthy rally, the second after hitting a beautiful cross-court forehand that Halep on the run can\u2019t return inside the lines. Another lengthy rally at deuce \u2013 both the best and longest of the match at 25 shots \u2013 ends when Azarenka crushes a winner into the corner. A game point for Vika, but Halep saves it when Azarenka overcooks a forehand. Net winner by Halep and she\u2019ll have a break point. Vika saves it and they trade points for a stretch as the storm clouds loom over the the grounds and the first few sprinkles of rain begin to fall. The players trade points until finally another game point for Azarenka. After a game that spans- more than 13 minutes, Azarenka escapes with the hard-won hold. Lengthy conversation with the chair umpire after the game on whether they will continue. For now they will. The heat rule is in effect for today\u2019s match. Or maybe it isn\u2019t? There seems to be confusion about why there\u2019s been a 10-minute break between the second and third sets. What we do know is it has been more than 10 minutes since the last point. Whatever it is, Halep has been out there waiting to play. Second set: Azarenka 6-4 Halep Halep wins the opening game but then mixes in a fifth double fault and it\u2019s 15-all. They trade winners for 30-all, then Halep mixes in a winner and Azarenka is a point away from forcing a decider. Halep then sprays a backhand wide early in a rally and Azarenka has the break. We\u2019re headed to a third and deciding set! Second set: Azarenka 5-4 Halep* (*denotes next server) Winner by Azarenka at the net followed by a Vika error and it\u2019s 15-all. Halep can\u2019t retrieve a swinging volley at the net, but on the next point she hits a forehand winner to make it 30-all. A half-chance here for the world No2. Now Azarenka mixes in an unforced error and all of a sudden Halep has a break point to move the set back on level terms. Vika faults and Halep pounces on the second serve to find her way into the rally, forcing Azarenka into an error on the backhandside. There\u2019s the break! Second set: *Azarenka 5-3 Halep (*denotes next server) At 30-30, a well constructed point by Halep wends with a forehand winner down the line to move her within a point of the game, but a forehand winner from the middle of the court brings it to deuce.

Second set: Azarenka 5-2 Halep* (*denotes next server) A quick point by Halep on Azarenka\u2019s serve, but Vika fires back with a forehand winner from the baseline followed by a Halep error and moves ahead 30-15.

Then Azarenka pushes a forehand long \u2013 her 20th unforced error of the day \u2013 followed by a winner to bring it deuce. Then Halep double-faults to give Azarenka a break chance and she capitalizes, forcing Halep to hit a difficult running forehand that sails wide of the line. Second set: Azarenka 3-2 Halep* (*denotes next server) How about this? Halep has rattled off seven straight point \u2013 including a run of three straight in this game capped by a shrewed passing winner off a misplayed drop shot by Vika \u2013 and how has three looks at a break point. A good 85mph second serve by Vika helps her win the point, but a backhand winner down the line by Halep gives her the break and we\u2019re back on level terms in the second. Second set: *Azarenka 3-1 Halep (*denotes next server) A blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it hold for Halep to keep pace with Azarenka, who has been mixing it up better since the break. Second set: Azarenka 3-0 Halep* (*denotes next server) Azarenka hits a winner then double faults as the match hits the hour mark.
