The evil hand of Nazi doom rests lightly upon the secretly gay brother and pushes him towards ruin. Cringe as his mother kisses the cursed stepfather-to-be! Thrill as the evil stepfather engineers his escape! Avert your eyes as the whole series veers into implausibility! And so we head towards the dying moments of The Halcyon. Unless I\u2019m wrong and there\u2019s a second series. It turns out, of course, that we were right all along. Fancyman D\u2019Aberville is a spook! \u201cOh the perils of a double life!\u201d Why do we only get to find out now what a) Toby\u2019s job is and b) that Toby is extremely important? I can\u2019t bear Cocktail Waiter\u2019s betrayal! How on Earth would he know what to look for? This is ridiculous. Too late to worry about that, though. What\u2019s done is done. At least the glamour was back for a bit, with added Jamie Cullum. And the anniversary celebrations are coming up! Meanwhile lots of gloom and frenzied plot action featuring people we have never seen before and are likely to never see again. Peggy\u2019s lost it and is seeing ghosts, understandably. \u201cPeggy feels it isn\u2019t safe here any more.\u201d Oh dear. This was a bit weepy and horrible. \u201cYou have to be a big girl.\u201d Evacuation is a great plotline, emotionally speaking. But why tell the story in seven seconds even if she was just going to Chertsey? Suddenly it all sped up, implausibly. A visit from Special Branch and then off to the Interrogation Centre at Latchmere House for a lot of shouting. Don\u2019t hit little Toby! But now Fancyman D\u2019Aberville was also on the rack. \u201cThere are good ways to leave \u2013 and there are bad.\u201d Onwards we marched. Lord Ambrose, Brigadier Harker, who are all these people? \u201cWere you close to your father? You understand why I\u2019m asking that, given his Nazi sympathies ...\u201d Ah, so the old man was a Nazi. We might have guessed. And these people are Daddy\u2019s friends. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cThey had a disagreement. It concerned Lord Ambrose\u2019s wife ... Be careful, his dislike of your father runs deep.\u201d Well, some high stakes at least. \u201cIt\u2019s this kind of entitlement that creates enemies.\u201d Hmm. There would be plenty of time to sort all this out if we had a lot more episodes ahead. But we don\u2019t. Plenty of red herrings were interspersed with all the espionage. Poor Mark Benton (playing Feldman), having to hand over his poem. I don\u2019t know what to say about that, other than that in real life this character (who has been brilliant and offered a lot of light relief throughout this series) would not write a poem, even a laughably awful poem. Equally irritating was the intervention by Creepy, Racist Troublemaker Fancyman No 2. \u201cYou boys all look a little alike to me... We let you come here...\u201d I won\u2019t repeat what was said next but I suppose it\u2019s accurate to the period, if not slightly overblown. This side of things was always going to be blown open at some point. Classily handled, although Fancyman No 2 did not deserve the bottle on the house (except over his head). In real life, of course, Mr Garland would not have sided with his employee. Mr O\u2019Hara was the only one with anything to celebrate this week as Emma finally succumbed to his dubious charms. \u201cThe first US president to be elected to a third term...\u201d And here he is referring to \u201cfake news\u201d or \u201calternative truths\u201d as \u201cartistic licence.\u201d And it went on: \u201cYour country\u2019s at war ... Justice and due process don\u2019t always win out.\u201d Heavens. Where have we heard this recently? You can\u2019t say they don\u2019t aim for contemporary relevance. Diamante brooch for best supporting costume Betsey was providing little competition in brown silk, looking understated for once this week. (Until the flesh-coloured lace corsage dress. Sigh.) Her Ladyship sparkled in the sequinned bolero. But Emma wins the prize for the ruched velvet burgundy dress. When you\u2019re going to see Jamie Cullum, you have to dress up, don\u2019t you? Inevitable Downton flashback moments For some reason I had forgotten (until I was helpfully reminded by the far more observant viewers below the line here) that Charles Edwards was Michael Gregson in Downton as well as being Lucian D\u2019Aberville, Fancyman Extraordinaire. Downton fans \u2013 and they are legion, friends, legion! \u2013 will recall that Mr Gregson was the newspaper editor who was set to wed Edith until it emerged he was already married to a madwoman and then he had to go and become a Nazi in Germany but not before fathering Marigold, the Imposter Child. Or something like that. (He actually was supposed to have been killed in Germany. But I always thought he must have gone to ground and would emerge at Goebbels.) Anyway, it\u2019s a fantastic Downton echo and Edwards does an excellent turn as an insecure pseudo-aristo who can never be trusted. Plaudits to the man. Show-stopping lines \u201cIf they do promote you, you can finally get a decent suit.\u201d I love Her Ladyship\u2019s pronunciation of \u201csee-yoot.\u201d Why hasn\u2019t she had any Dame Maggie lines for about five episodes? \u201cI\u2019m not your snivelling man-servant.\u201d No, that would be Cocktail Man who has really, er, cocked things up. \u201cOne more drink and then we\u2019ll go.\u201d \u201cOne or two more drinks.\u201d Emma goes kerrazy. \u201cThere\u2019s something about you \u2026 Brings out in the worst in me.\u201d Move over, Brief Encounter!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
