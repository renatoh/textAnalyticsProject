Smaller than a pinhead, two tiny shards of silicon have been sculpted by university micro-engineers as a marketing ploy to show off the skills of their tiny but highly profitable world. Both are unprecedentedly small models of two of northern England's many jumbo structures - the Angel of the North statue by Antony Gormley and the curved Tyne Bridge opened by King George V in 1928. The two models were delicately crafted using techniques from chemistry, physics and mechanical engineering. The cables on the bridge are less than a tenth of the width of a human hair. \"They're not gimmicks,\" said Richard Carter, business director of Innovation in Nanotechnology Exploitation, which hunts for business for the scientists at Newcastle University's institute for nanoscale science and technology. The department specialises in minute adjustments to computer chip material - usually silicon - for communications businesses. The work was part of a technology development programme looking at new ways to make very small structures and devices. Each mini-sculpture is about 400 micrometres wide, against the 177ft wingspan of the angel and the 7,100 tonne weight of Mott Hay and Anderson's bridge across the Tyne. Interest in the pair may prompt models of other landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
