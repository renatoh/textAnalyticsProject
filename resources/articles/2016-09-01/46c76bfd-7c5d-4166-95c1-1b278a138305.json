But the Republican presidential candidate continued to falsely claim that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy theory. Clinton spoke only a few blocks away at the Black Women\u2019s Agenda symposium, held at a downtown hotel. Clinton said that \u201cthere is no erasing\u201d Trump\u2019s role in spreading the \u201cbirther\u201d gospel. \u201cFor five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,\u201d she said. \u201cHis campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. \u201cHe is feeding into the worst impulses, the bigotry and bias, that lurks in our country. Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple, and Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.\u201d Speaking in Virginia, first lady Michelle Obama told an audience of college students that criticism of her husband\u2019s birthplace have been a constant companion since 2008, without mentioning Trump\u2019s name. \u201cThere were those who questioned and continued to question for the past eight years and to this day whether my husband was even born in this country,\u201d she said, alluding to the Republican nominee without mentioning him by name. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party will not be allowed to take part in the first televised debate of the race for the White House,the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced today. Johnson, once a Republican governor of New Mexico, has pinned his hopes on taking part in the debates. He and Stein, however, fell well short of the 15% national polling average required to participate. Donald Trump today named one of the nation\u2019s top anti-abortion activists to his campaign coalition, in the clearest signal yet that the presidential candidate has fully embraced Republicans\u2019 typically harsh stance against abortion. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B Anthony List, a group that works to elect Republican, anti-abortion women, will chair the loose coalition of conservative, anti-abortion rights leaders who are working to elect the Republican nominee. Trump\u2019s campaign also announced that he would commit to a law banning public funding of abortion. Donald Trump just told a Florida audience that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will \u201ctake your jobs, Ohio - remember, it\u2019s gonna take your jobs, Ohio.\u201d Mere hours after he appeared to put one of the oldest criticisms of his presidential campaign to rest with the acknowledgment that President Barack Obama was born in the United States, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told supporters that his opponent\u2019s Secret Service detail should disarm itself due to what he characterized as her opposition to the Second Amendment. \u201cTake their guns away,\u201d Trump said of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens to her.\u201d Speaking at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida, Trump criticized Clinton\u2019s stance on gun-control issues, characterizing her stance as wanting to \u201cabolish\u201d the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. (This claim has been debunked.) If Clinton were truly as anti-gun as she claims to be, Trump told the audience, her Secret Service detail should disarm itself. \u201cI think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons - they should disarm. I think they should disarm immediately, what do you think?\u201d Trump asked the raucous crowd. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens to her.\u201d Trump was deeply criticized in August after suggesting at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, that gunowners could take the Second Amendment into their own hands if Clinton were elected and began nominating Supreme Court justices. \u201cHillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ll tell you what, that will be a horrible day.\u201d The remarks were seen by many - including the Democratic nominee herself - as hinting at calling for Clinton\u2019s assassination, or that of her judicial nominees. Donald Trump, on racism: The \u2018racist word\u2019 - it\u2019s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook, and Americans have had enough of it. We get it. We get it. After bragging about how many African American and Latino employees he has, Donald Trump tells the audience in Miami, Florida, that he is campaigning \u201cin every part of this country for every last vote.\u201d \u201cWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable - boy, that second word is tough, but that is tough,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and really, really, really love your country.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks are met with a U-S-A chant. Donald Trump has walked onstage in Miami, as a Les Miserables spoof banner - Les Deplorables - shows his acolytes launching a revolution. \u201cWelcome to all of you deplorables!\u201d Trump tells the audience. Standard fare as Republican speakers warm up the crowd ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s scheduled 6pm appearance. \u201cIt\u2019s a honor to be with so many deplorables,\u201d says Blaise Ingoglio, chair of Florida\u2019s RNC. Inevitable chants of USA! USA! follow. He returns to address the crowd in Spanish, and the audience is notably quieter. Even a mention of Marco Rubio, the Florida senator and former Trump opponent in the primary race who is hugely popular around these parts, raised barely a ripple. But other speakers, conservative commentator AJ Delgado, a senior Trump campaign adviser born to Cuban-immigrant parents, and Carlos Curbelo, a Republican congressman from South Miami who has until now been lukewarm on his support for Trump, got the crowd fired up again, with the now-familiar \u201cHillary lied\u201d narrative. Cue shouts of \u201clock her up, lock her up!\u201dTrump is in the house and on stage imminently, and the auditorium is now full. Watch it live here: Few of the Trump supporters The Guardian spoke to on their way in to tonight\u2019s rally in downtown Miami had much time for today\u2019s developments in the \u201cbirther\u201d controversy. \u201cIt\u2019s a distraction to what we should be talking about,\u201d said Michael Rodriguez, 34, a Cuban-American restaurant worker who lives in Little Havana. \u201cThis election is about jobs, the economy, immigration and America being strong again.\u201d Janusz Biskupek, 50, of Boca Raton, cut a striking figure in a pristine white suit emblazoned with pro-Trump slogans. \u201cTrump is a smart guy. I want my president to be respected,\u201d he said. \u201cObama? He went to Cuba and nobody waited on him. We need a stronger president. We need Donald Trump.\u201d The arena at the James L Knight centre, however, was filling up slowly, with plenty of room still in the bleachers with Trump scheduled on stage in less than half an hour. Perhaps the rival attraction of a Friday night Kanye West concert a stone\u2019s thrown away was more of a draw. The choice for president is \u201cexcruciatingly clear\u201d, First Lady Michelle Obama said during her campaign trail debut, urging the college audience to support Hillary Clinton this November. Obama cast the election as a choice between \u201cone of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president\u201d and someone who doesn\u2019t \u201ctake the job seriously\u201d. Ticking off a list of accomplishments of her husband\u2019s administration, Obama argued that with the past eight years as a guide, Trump is neither prepared nor qualified to be president. \u201cA candidate is not going to suddenly change when they get into office \u2013 it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d Obama told the crowd of mostly students and young people at George Mason University in Virginia. \u201cIn fact, because the minute that individual takes that oath, they are under the hottest, harshest light there is.\u201d She referenced her moving speech at the Democratic National Convention, \u201cwhen they go low, we go high,\u201d going after the Republican nominee without mentioning his name. \u201cBeing president isn\u2019t anything like reality TV,\u201d she said, drawing loud cheers and applause. Obama recalled the 2008 campaign, reminding the audience that raising questions about a president\u2019s experience, qualifications and judgments is all part of a very public vetting process to be president. \u201cAnd then there were those who questioned and continued to question for the past eight years and to this day whether my husband was even born in this country,\u201d she said, alluding to the Republican nominee without mentioning him by name. Trump helped fan the flames of birtherism, a conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the US but in Kenya, and used the issue to help propel his political ambitions. Facing dismal approval ratings among minority voters, Trump admitted on Friday morning for the first time that Barack Obama was born in the US. Obama is a powerful and popular ally for Clinton, especially among young voters. New polling shows that millennials, disappointed by their options for president have turned toward third-party candidates. The First Lady\u2019s appearance on a college campus in the battleground state of Virginia, the First Lady\u2019s event is part of a broader push by the Clinton campaign to win back some of the millennial voters who have strayed in recent weeks. Next week, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic challenger whose campaign was powered by young people and students, will campaign for Clinton in the coming days. \u201cElections aren\u2019t just about who votes but who doesn\u2019t vote,\u201d she said, imploring the young people in the crowd to support Clinton. She encouraged them to fight the urge to want to \u201chide under the bed\u201d and avoid the election altogether. She also addressed a complaint many young people who felt inspired by Sander\u2019s underdog campaign have leveled at Clinton. \u201cI hear folks saying they don\u2019t feel inspired in this election,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWell let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I\u2019ve had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job, and here is what I absolutely know for sure. Listen to this: Right now we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president.\u201d Perhaps above all, the campaign event was a testament to Obama\u2019s enduring popularity. \u201cIt is so hard to believe that it is less than 2 months until election and that my family is almost at the end of term,\u201d Obama said. The crowd broke into a raucous round of chanting: \u201cFour more years\u201d chant. \u201cNo,\u201d Obama protested, waving her hand at the crowd as the chant continued. \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cI promise you,\u201d she said, \u201cBarack and I will continue to work for you for the rest of our lives.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is attempting to prove the false allegation that Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign ignited the birther rumors about then-opponent Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship with an interview transcript from a CNN phoner with Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager. The transcript falls short of this claim: PATTI SOLIS DOYLE: There was a volunteer coordinator, I believe in late 2007, I think in December, one of our volunteer coordinators in one of the counties in Iowa. I don\u2019t recall whether they an actual paid staffer, but they did forward an e-mail that promoted the conspiracy. WOLF BLITZER: The birther conspiracy? DOYLE: Yeah. Hillary made the decision immediately to let that person go. We let that person go. Billionaire Fight! The whole thread is worth a gander. Bellicose bloviator Rush Limbaugh made a major concession this afternoon, telling listeners that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is not, in fact, a conservative. \u201cCan somebody point to me the conservative on the ballot?\u201d Limbaugh asked his listeners this afternoon. \u201c\u2018What do you mean, Rush? Are you admitting Trump is not a conservative?\u2019 Damn right I am!\u201d he thundered. \u201cFolks, when did I ever say that he was? Look, I don\u2019t know how to tell you this. Conservatism lost, in the primary, if that\u2019s how you want to look at it. We had Cruz; we had Rubio.\u201d Limbaugh sounded uncharacteristically defeated in the segment, expressing frustration with the nomination of Republicans who are not conservative enough. \u201cEven what we\u2019ve seen now, we haven\u2019t seen anything,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cBut the establishment\u2019s gonna come together to protect themselves regardless of ideology. I wish conservatism was on the ballot.\u201d Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson has reacted to the Commission on Presidential Debates\u2019 announcement that only Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be invited to the first debate of the general-election campaign with frustration, but not with surprise. \u201cI would say I am surprised that the CPD has chosen to exclude me from the first debate, but I\u2019m not,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cAfter all, the commission is a private organization created 30 years ago by the Republican and Democratic parties for the clear purpose of taking control of the only nationally-televised presidential debates voters will see. At the time of its creation, the leaders of those two parties made no effort to hide the fact that they didn\u2019t want any third party intrusions into their shows.\u201d \u201cThe CPD may scoff at a ticket that enjoys \u2018only\u2019 9 or 10% in their hand-selected polls, but even 9% represents 13 million voters, more than the total population of Ohio and most other states. Yet, the Republicans and Democrats are choosing to silence the candidate preferred by those millions of Americans.\u201d \u201cIt is unfortunate that the CPD doesn\u2019t believe such a voice should be heard. There are more polls and more debates, and we plan to be on the debate stage in October.\u201d It\u2019s official: Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will be the only candidates to appear on the stage at the first presidential debate of the general-election campaign, after Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party nominee Jill Stein failed to reach the polling threshold necessary to merit an invitation. The Commission on Presidential Debates released a statement officially declaring that Clinton, Trump and their running mates will be the only people to appear in the first two debates: The Board determined that the polling averages called for... are as follows: Hillary Clinton (43%), Donald Trump (40.4%), Gary Johnson (8.4%) and Jill Stein (3.2%). Accordingly, Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, and Donald Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, qualify to participate in the September 26 presidential debate and the October 4 vice-presidential debate, respectively. No other candidates satisfied the criteria for inclusion. The composition of the final two presidential debates will be decided upon polling in the future. Here\u2019s a video stream of first lady Michelle Obama campaigning for Clinton in northern Virginia: Ben Carson, whose campaign used money raised in the name of the lord to pay political consultants for \u2013 what? \u2013 and who believes that Putin, Khameni and Abbas used the pyramids to store guns with which Jews could have prevented the Holocaust, or something, has launched an \u201cideas forum\u201d: Something\u2019s falling apart. Not clear what it is. The web site of the person who runs Trump\u2019s campaign thinks it\u2019s funny that Trump announces news conferences he doesn\u2019t hold and seems to find Trump\u2019s sudden reversal on the question of Barack Obama\u2019s native birth funny, too. Harmless at least. Or funny in its harmfulness? And for some reason this Breitbart post includes a picture of Harambe the gorilla. The person who runs this web site is currently running Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign: The national fraternal order of police, the largest union of police officers with more than 330,000 members, has endorsed Donald Trump for president. The union withheld an endorsement in 2012, endorsed Republicans in \u201808, \u201804 and \u201800 and endorsed Bill Clinton in 1996. In August the group issued a statement saying it was \u201cdisappointed and shocked\u201d to hear Hillary Clinton would not seek their endorsement. \u201cObviously, this is an unusual election,\u201d a letter released by the group quotes group president Chuck Canterbury as saying. The letter says Clinton did not seek the endorsement and Trump \u201cunderstands and supports our priorities and our members believe he will make America safe again.\u201d The congressional black caucus political action committee is not impressed with Trump: There\u2019s a lot more where that came from \u2013 branded umbrellas, duvets, ice buckets, beds, furniture, etc. Check out @American_Bridge for more. Trump is asked whether he will apologize to the president for his five-year-long drumbeat of racist attacks which he now has stopped beating it. The drum. Trump ignores the question. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Steven Thrasher on Trump\u2019s appearance on Jimmy Fallon last night: On Thursday, Jimmy Fallon had Donald Trump on the Tonight Show and ended the segment by saying, \u201cDonald I want to ask you, because the next time I see you you could be the President of the United States. I just want to know if there is something we could do that\u2019s just not really presidential, really \u2013 can I mess your hair up?\u201d Trump let him and the NBC audience roared with laughter. But, for many of us, this is very far from being a joke. Giving comic cover to Trump just isn\u2019t funny when he\u2019s unleashed forces of anti-blackness and anti-immigrant sentiment. He\u2019s labelled Mexicans rapists, raised the prospect of a ban on Muslims, patronized and insulted African Americans while pretending to be a potential new hope. As a result, Fallon managed to come over as one powerful white man protecting another. Not only was it not funny. It didn\u2019t do anything to take Trump down a notch (if it was even meant to). Instead, it humanized him, boosting him on that stupid metric so many Americans use when choosing a president: \u201cHey, he\u2019s a guy I\u2019d want to have a beer with! Look at him, letting Fallon have fun with him!\u201d Harry Reid isn\u2019t slowing down today (see earlier): \u201cWhat a liar. He never questioned the citizenship of anyone else running for president... he is just such a phony.\u201d Clinton is still going: Gallup tracks Hillary Clinton\u2019s favorability on a juggernaut streak to 40% while Trump languishes in the low 30s. Good times: Clinton\u2019s Twitter account is walloping Trump for having, again, falsely accused her of originating birtherism when he has been its top evangelist: Actual billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is offering to give $10m to the charity of Donald Trump\u2019s choice \u2013 or to Trump himself \u2013 if Trump lets Cuban interview him for four hours: 2) @realDonaldTrump groundrules are that you cant mention the Clintons or discuss anything other than the details and facts of yr plans and 3) @realDonaldTrump and no one else is in the room to help. Just me, you and a broadcast crew. Deal ? 5) @realDonaldTrump In the inmortal words of YOU. \u201cWhat do you have to lose ?\u201d The Clinton campaign has released a statement reacting to the Trump event, in the name of campaign manager Robbie Mook: Trump\u2019s actions today were disgraceful. After five years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory into the mainstream, it was appalling to watch Trump appoint himself the judge of whether the President of the United States is American. This sickening display shows more than ever why Donald Trump is totally unfit to be president. Kasich\u2019s take on Trump\u2019s birther switcharoo: Springsteen will sell more albums: Somebody let Ohio governor John Kasich, who has said it is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that he\u2019d vote for Trump, into the Brady briefing room: This seems about right. Free the media! Trump, today: President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Trump, 2011-present: Profile in courage here. The media is not cooperating with Trump\u2019s invitation to tour his new hotel. The fourth estate lives. Trump leaving the event, which the campaign billed as a press conference, ignoring shouted questions by the media: What did you think of that? Well what did you think of that? Trump has just uttered the lie that we preemptively debunked an hour ago. He said Clinton started birtherism. She did not. Trump: Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to go back to making America strong again. Trump\u2019s done. No news conference, as he had announced. He repeats that \u201cthis is such an amazing honor.\u201d \u201cWe have to get back to work,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very much left behind. .. We talk about the word depletion. The military has been so badly treated.\u201d Here now is Trump. There\u2019s a USA! USA! chant in the room that goes up. Another veteran has stood to say that Trump \u201cknows how to take the handcuffs off America\u2019s economy.\u201d CNN is starting to break away from the event. The anchors are in a split screen with the event at least. Naw, we take every event both candidates do. But this has been a bait-and-switch. The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs is inside the ballroom: Multi-disciplinary inter-agency guy says he\u2019s been \u201ctotally impressed with Mr Trump\u2019s stamina... and his intellectual curiosity.\u201d And his temperament. \u201cBut the thing I\u2019ve been most impressed with is his absolute love for the men and women in uniform.\u201d Does that love extend to paying his taxes? One wonders. Here\u2019s another medal of honor winner speaking on behalf of Trump. He was awarded the silver star after service in the Korean war. \u201cI\u2019ve become convinced that our nation needs a multi-displinary inter-agency approach to defeat our enemy,\u201d he begins. This guy\u2019s a Trump voter? Another medal of honor winner speaks, Bob Patterson. He says he\u2019s watched the country \u201ctake a complete turnaround from where it was.\u201d \u201cWe used to be the shining star on the hill,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time we send someone to Washington that knows how to say, \u2018you\u2019re fired.\u2019\u201d Trump says that. Thornton speaks. He tells the crowd to stop clapping. I have known Mr Trump since 1986, and when it wasn\u2019t fashionable to support the military... he supported us at that period of time. He says his medal of honor represents everyone and \u201cfreedom is not free.\u201d Thornton says life is short. \u201cThis election means so much. We do not need any more bureaucratic leadership from Washington DC. \u201cMr Trump has never failed at anything, because he listens to his advisers, he listens to his people,\u201d Thornton said. Now let\u2019s all go out for a Trump steak at Trump\u2019s casino in Atlantic City. So that\u2019s who the folks on stage are. Medal of honor recipients who\u2019ve endorsed Trump. Trump introduces Mike Thornton, medal of honor recipient. Thornton is a former Seal. He got the medal of honor for his actions in the Vietnam War. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have him on my team, and also fellow recipient Bob Patterson.\u201d \u201cWe have 17 medal of honor recipients, and they\u2019ve all endorsed me for president of the United States.\u201d Here\u2019s the Trump stream again if you need it: Trump: I said this will be the best hotel in Washington. I think it really may be one of the best hotels in the world. That\u2019s how it turned out. OK Trump has materialized. \u201cNice hotel,\u201d he says. \u201cUnder budget and ahead of schedule, isn\u2019t that nice. This is a brand-new ballroom, you only see a small piece of it... we\u2019ll be having our opening ceremony in October. ... it\u2019s such an honor to have our first event.. for medal of honor winners.\u201d Here\u2019s the full text of Obama\u2019s response to ABC\u2019s Jon Karl on the question of whether he was born in the USA: I, Jon, have no reaction and I\u2019m shocked that a question like that has come up at a time when we have so many other things to do. Well, I\u2019m not that shocked actually. It\u2019s fairly typical. We got other things to attend to. I was pretty confident about where I was born. I think most people were as well. My hope would be the presidential elect, election reflects more serious issues than that. Clinton this morning has called on Donald Trump to apologize to the president and to the American people for spreading the racist \u201cbirther\u201d notion that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. ABC News asked the president whether he is owed an apology, but \u2013 perhaps thankfully for the integrity of the republic \u2013 the president did not respond. (See update below.) Update: The president has commented on his birht. Sanders gets in on it too: In an interview Wednesday, the eldest Trump offspring used Holocaust imagery to mount a political attack. He said: The media has been her number one surrogate in this. Without the media, this wouldn\u2019t even be a contest, but the media has built her up. They\u2019ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy, [sic] on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing. If Republicans were doing that, they\u2019d be warming up the gas chamber right now. Not Trump Jr concedes a \u201cperhaps\u201d \u201cpoor choice of words\u201d: On Thursday, the Clinton campaign called the comments \u201cinsensitive, divisive and reckless\u201d: Donald Trump Jr\u2019s recent comments invoking the use of gas chambers to make a political attack show just how insensitive, divisive, and reckless the Trump campaign is. The bottom line is this \u2013 offensive references to the Holocaust are never acceptable, especially from a presidential campaign. Donald Trump has got a lot of people on the stage where he will speak. Who are they? The campaign has yet to send around a list. This hotel just opened and Trump\u2019s appearance serves to advertise that he is open for business in DC \u2013 in addition to advancing whatever Trumpism he is going to advance. The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs is at the event. While we wait for Trump. He may say that Hillary Clinton started the \u201cbirther\u201d movement (his campaign said that last night). That\u2019s not the case. Don\u2019t take our word for it. Consult Politifact: There is no record that Clinton herself or anyone within her campaign ever advanced the charge that Obama was not born in the United States. A review by our fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org reported that no journalist who investigated this ever found a connection to anyone in the Clinton organization. Consult the Washington Post: This is simply not true. Clinton\u2019s campaign, one of the most thoroughly dissected in modern history, never raised questions about the future president\u2019s citizenship. The idea that it did is based largely on a series of disconnected actions bysupporters of Clinton, mostly in the months between Obama\u2019s reaction to the Jeremiah Wright story and the Democratic National Convention. I know, because I spent/wasted quite a lot of time covering this stuff. Consult factcheck.org: But none of those stories suggests any link between the Clinton campaign, let alone Clinton herself, and the advocacy of theories questioning Obama\u2019s birth in Hawaii. We report, you decide. That\u2019s the line, isn\u2019t it? Trump\u2019s due to speak soon. Here\u2019s a live video stream (apologies for not getting the Clinton stream in earlier, she started earlier than we\u2019d anticipated): To rise up, but most importantly, to show up at the polls this November. With our power and strength. I know. I believe this or I would not be standing here before you... that together we can build a future, where yes, love trumps hate. She\u2019s out. She coughs a bit at the end. Clinton: In many ways, this profound choice is up to the women in this room. African American women turned out to vote more than any other group of Americans in 2012. This year once again you have your hands on the wheel of history and you can write the next chapter of the American story. Clinton: He is feeding into the worst impulses, the bigotry and bias, that lurks in our country. Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple, and Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology. Donald Trump looks at president Obama.. he still doesn\u2019t see him as American. Think of how dangerous that is. Think of a person in the Oval Office who traffics in conspiracy theories, and refuses to let them go, no matter what the facts are... Imagine a president who sees a person who doesn\u2019t look like him... and thinks, that person isn\u2019t a real American. Donald Trump is unfit to be president of the United States. We cannot become insensitive to what he says, and what he serves up. We can\u2019t just accept this. We\u2019ve got to stand up to it ... Donald Trump looks at a distinguished federal judge, born in Indiana, and sees a Mexican... he looks at a gold-star family and sees them as Muslims, not patriotic Americans. He looks at women and decides how our looks rate on a scale of 1-10. I look at America, and I see everything...[our diversity is our strength]. We know who Donald Trump is. Now it\u2019s time for our country to show who we are. Clinton: We know who Donald is. For five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president. His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history. Clinton: I believe every election is important. But this one feels different, doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s because it is. The next 53 days will shape the next 50 years. \u201cIt goes to show that black women deserve more than a seat at the table. It\u2019s past time that you had a chance to run the meeting,\u201d Clinton says. She\u2019s being continuously applauded. I would not be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States were it not for black women like you ... I\u2019m going to close my campaign the way I began my career all those years ago at the children\u2019s defense fund... I will be focused on opportunities for kids [and families]. The American people deserve something to vote for, not just against. \u201cWhile your stories may not appear in the history books,\u201d Clinton says, \u201cyou are changemakers, the pathbreakers and the ground shakers.\u201d You are proof that yes indeed, black girl magic is real. The question is moot. Clinton has just started: \u201cThe good news is, my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women\u2019s health!\u201d she says. Generous laughs. My instinct was, to push through it. That\u2019s what women do every day... I think it is fair to say that black women have an even tougher road. Both Clinton\u2019s and Trump\u2019s events are scheduled to start at 10pm. We\u2019ll provide lives streams for both. Which one should we take in in real time? Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Hillary Clinton is scheduled to attend a Black Women\u2019s Agenda Annual Symposium Workshop &amp; Awards Luncheon in Washington DC today. Michelle Obama will campaign for Clinton in Fairfax, Virginia. Donald Trump has an event this morning at his new hotel in Washington DC, and one this evening in Miami. Campaigns tangle on \u2018birther\u2019 issue Trump said on Fox News this morning that he plans to make a statement today on whether Barack Obama was born in the US. On Thursday, his campaign released a statement asserting the candidate believed that. This morning his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, who \u2013 oh bash it, let\u2019s hear what Bernie Sanders thinks: Sanders: \u2018This is pathetic\u2019 Reid smacks Trump After Trump taunted him for a workout injury that blinded him in one eye, Senate minority leader Harry Reid, who called Trump a \u201chuman leech\u201d on the Senate floor on Thursday, has continued to attack Trump with a statement obtained by Politico in which Reid calls Trump a \u201ccon artist\u201d and says: Donald Trump can make fun of the injury that crushed the side of my face and took the sight in my right eye all he wants \u2013 I\u2019ve dealt with tougher opponents than him. I may not be able to see out of my right eye, but with my good eye, I can see that Trump is a man who inherited his money and spent his entire life pretending like he earned it. In Searchlight, we learned a thing or two about hard work that Trump may not have learned at his boarding school. Trump rips off working people with scams like Trump University. And while the people he ripped off suffer, Trump sits at the posh resort he bought with his daddy\u2019s money, with no understanding of the misery he caused. Kasich: \u2018very unlikely\u2019 he\u2019d vote for Trump Can the popular Ohio governor herd voters in his crucial swing state (no Republican has won the presidency without Ohio) away from Trump? It does not seem to have been working so far. Thanks for reading, and please join us in the comments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
