According to a Federal Aviation Administration document first reported by the Times, the registration for Trump\u2019s Cessna 750 Citation X jet came to an end in January and is not currently in good standing with the FAA, which means that the jet may be forced out of commission for days or even weeks while its registration is updated. The lapse means that the dozens of trips Trump has taken on the aircraft \u2013 which he owns through a limited liability company \u2013 since January may have exposed him to serious civil and criminal penalties. Flying an aircraft without proper registration is punishable by a civil penalty of up to $27,500, a $250,000 criminal fine and up to three years\u2019 imprisonment. Trump\u2019s personal aircraft have become vital campaign props during his improbable rise to frontrunner status in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. He arrived at the Iowa state fair ahead of the state\u2019s caucus in one of his three Sikorsky helicopters, which he then loaned out to allow Iowa children the chance to ride it. He frequently gives stump speeches in front of his custom Boeing 757, which has its own theme music, lifted from the 1997 action film Air Force One. The 757\u2019s registration is good through 2018, according to FAA records, but it still poses a problem: it is too large to land at many smaller airports, where Trump frequently hosts his rallies. Losing out on his personal Cessna for a few weeks ahead of the so-called \u201cAcela primaries\u201d in the mid-Atlantic region next week might complicate Trump\u2019s travel plans \u2013 and require the expense of renting a smaller jet in the meantime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
