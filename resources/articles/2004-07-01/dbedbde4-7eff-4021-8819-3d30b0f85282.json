The company said interim sales increased 14% to $13.6bn (\u00a37.3bn), while net income had grown 19% to $2.8bn. The news gave relief to the rest of the drugs sector after months of dismal performance on the stock market, and the share prices of pharmaceutical groups shot up yesterday. However, analysts warned that Novartis has a number of good new drugs on the market and its results are not necessarily a signal that the rest of the sector is doing well. Novartis's relatively new drugs include Diovan, for high blood pressure, which is now its biggest seller with sales of $1.5bn in the first half. It also developed Glivec, for chronic myeloid leukemia, with sales of $757m, and Zometa, for complications associated with cancer, which fetched $526m. \"I am... pleased that we have gained market share, marking 10 consecutive quarters of growth above the market average with margin improvements ahead of plan,\" said chairman and chief executive Dr Daniel Vasella. The profits were better than most analysts expected, due to a lower proportion spent on research and development, sales teams and marketing. \"In the first half the mix of business improved, with a shift towards speciality products like Zometa and Glivec,\" said Stewart Adkins, analyst at Lehman Brothers. \"They are prescribed by specialist doctors so you don't need an army of sales people. \"You don't need to persuade hundreds of thousands of GPs to use Glivec, it is such a wonder drug that pretty much everyone is going to be given it that needs it.\" Novartis has to spend a lot on drugs such as Diovan which have many competitors, and it is investing money in an advertising campaign to increase public knowledge of high blood pressure in the US. The company was bullish about the drugs it owns that are still in clinical trials. LAF237, a new diabetes drug, SPP100, a new treatment for high blood pressure, and cancer drug PTK are all in late-stage trials on humans. Yesterday Novartis's shares rose 4.6% to 55.7 Swiss francs. Novartis's results led to a rare cloud of euphoria surrounding the UK drugs firms, with GlaxoSmithKline up 1.9% to \u00a310.65 and AstraZeneca 2.8% higher at \u00a323.56. Since the start of this year Glaxo has lost 18% of its value over concerns about the American market, particularly after US group Pfizer cuts its revenue forecasts last week. Branded pharmaceuticals provide about two-thirds of Novartis's sales, but it also has a large consumer health division which includes off-patent generic pharmaceuticals, animal medicine and baby food. The generic pharmaceuticals business Sandoz reported falling sales which it blamed on increased competition for the antibiotic AmoxC. The company has bought several generics companies recently and has said it fancies acquiring more. Sales of over-the-counter drugs such as anti-inflamma tory drug Voltaren, fungal infection treatment Lamisil and fibre-adding powder Benefiber increased 16%. Its veterinary medicine, contact lens and nutrition businesses also increased sales."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
