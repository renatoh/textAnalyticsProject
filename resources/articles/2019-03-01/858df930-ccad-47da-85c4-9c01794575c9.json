Oberman who, with the Countdown presenter Rachel Riley, plans to sue 70 Twitter users for aggressive \u201ctrolling\u201d about her campaign to rid the Labour party of antisemitism, will play the lead in a production of The Merchant of Venice she is devising with the experienced Shakespearean director Brigid Larmour. The pair are to move the courtroom drama from its original setting in Renaissance Venice to the East End of London in the 1930s, when political unrest and racial prejudice were rife. \u201cIt is a very problematic play. And it\u2019s clear Shakespeare\u2019s Shylock, along with Dickens\u2019s Fagin, is difficult as a Jewish fictional stereotype, but when I watched the all-female Julius Caesar in 2012, I saw the way these roles can be open to reinterpretation,\u201d said Oberman this weekend, adding that she intends to draw on what she has learned about the nature of antisemitism. Oberman, who is best known for television roles in EastEnders and in the hit comedies Friday Night Dinner and Toast of London, was later asked to give a reading of Shylock\u2019s most famous speech about bigotry, containing the line, \u201cIf you prick us, do we not bleed?\u201d at a charity event. Further inspiration came from family memories of Oberman\u2019s great grandmother, Annie, who lived through that turbulent time in the city. \u201cWomen like her were tough as nails and so I pictured Shylock as a matriach like that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe 30s was a very difficult time to be Jewish, to be working-class and to be a woman.\u201d Talking through her ideas with Larmour, the shape of what Oberman describes as \u201ca viable living world of a different Rialto\u201d emerged. \u201cBrigid is such an intelligent director and she was very positive,\u201d said Oberman. The two women are already in discussions with a leading artistic director and are to work on the script with a group of actors at the Watford Palace Theatre in early May. The fresh version of the play will also pay tribute, Oberman hopes, to other Jewish women, such as Riley, the MPs Luciana Berger, Ruth Smeeth and Margaret Hodge, who have each spoken out on the issue bedevilling the Labour party. \u201cThey have been incredibly brave,\u201d said Oberman. \u201cAnd the response has been racism and mysogyny that I wouldn\u2019t have believed and that hasn\u2019t been seen since the 1930s. But I have tried with everything that\u2019s happened to put it to positive use. I hope it has pushed my creativity into much more powerful and positive directions, not just in seeing a new way to play Shylock, but in a new podcast I am about to launch called Trolled.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
