Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The increasingly polarised US economy has meant that a record-breaking period of growth has been accompanied by falling life expectancy, high levels of poverty and stagnant living standards for average Americans, the International Monetary Fund has said. In its annual health check on the world\u2019s biggest economy, the IMF highlighted a range of \u201ctroubling\u201d social indicators marring a decade-long expansion which in July will be the longest in the country\u2019s history. It called for more generous in-work benefits for the low paid, a minimum wage rise, higher spending on education and action to reduce deaths by opioids as part of a wide-ranging programme of anti-poverty measures. The IMF\u2019s annual article IV consultation said the US economy had shown extraordinary resilience, noting that unemployment was at its lowest in 50 years, but that \u201cthe benefits from this decade-long expansion have not been widely shared\u201d. The IMF also identified several kay areas where the US economy is failing Americans, particularly those at the lower end of the wealth and income scale: The impact of rising suicides and drug overdoses on falling life expectancy, now one of the lowest in the G7. A rise of just 2.2% in inflation-adjusted incomes for the median US household since the end of the 1990s, even though per capita incomes have risen by 23%. A decrease in wealth among the poorest 40% of the population since 1983. The fact that 45 million Americans live in poverty. An erosion of social mobility so that half of today\u2019s young American adults earn less than their parents did at a similar age. Forty years ago the figure was 10%. Poor education outcomes by international standards despite devoting a bigger slice of national income to schools and colleges. Just in: The International Monetary Fund has hiked its growth forecasts for the US economy. It now expects growth of 2.6% this year...but the bad news is that growth drops to 2%. And if the trade war with China worsens, growth could be rather weaker. This is what Ford\u2019s decision means to workers: Meanwhile in Vilnius, the European Central Bank has extended its pledge to keep interest rates at their current record low. The ECB now won\u2019t hike borrowing costs above zero until the middle of 2020, as it struggles with low growth and weak inflation. The central bank also slashed its 2020 growth forecast from 1.6% to 1.4%, while also nudging up its 2019 forecast from 1.1% to 1.2%. ECB president Mario Draghi revealed that some members of the governing council had discussed the possibility of cutting interest rates to new record lows, or restarting its QE stimulus programme. That highlights the weakness of the European economy -- bad news for companies such as Ford as they also struggle with technological change. Draghi was also questioned about the \u2018minibots\u2019 which Italy\u2019s parliament has approved this week. They\u2019re new securities which Rome could used to pay off individuals and companies who are owed money by the state as payment for services or as tax rebates. Analysts have suggested they could run as a new parallel currency - something Draghi points out would be illegal under eurozone rules: \u2018Minibots\u2019 are either money and then they are illegal or they are debt and then the stock of debt goes up. I don\u2019t think there is a third possibility. Ford workers at Bridgend have been sent home early after learning that their factory will close next year. Some spoke to media outside the plant. Press Association reports that Len Jones, 48, who has worked at the plant for seven-and-a-half years, said: \u201cIt\u2019s devastating. Everyone\u2019s got mortgages to pay and families to support. \u201cI expected a little more time to get things sorted. \u201cWhen we found out, everyone was just silent. They gave us letters and we just all went home. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to take in really, even though we expected it. Now it\u2019s official, it\u2019s a bad thing, really.\u201d Another, named Stephen, explained how demand for Bridgend\u2019s new 1.5-litre engine had dwindled: \u201cThe writing has been on the wall for a long time. We knew when the Sigma engine finished there was no replacement. We knew when the AJ engine finished there was no replacement. The predicted volumes for new Dragon engine were 250,000, then 125,000, then the last thing we had was for 70,000.\u201d Supervisor Claire Shortland reported that the mood inside was \u201cDismal, but sort of expected really\u201d. She\u2019s already been through this situation once, having worked at Ford\u2019s Southampton factory which closed in 2013. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do now. I sort of packed everything up and came here from Southampton when we stopped making Transit and now this.\u201d The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the industry body, has hinted that Brexit is a factor behind Bridgend\u2019s closure. SMMT chairman Mike Hawes points to the \u2018economic uncertainty\u2019 in the UK as one factor (and we all know the principle cause of that uncertainty). Hawes says: Today\u2019s announcement is another crushing blow for UK automotive manufacturing and, especially, the staff and their families in and around Bridgend. Ford\u2019s challenges are not unique: economic uncertainty at home and abroad, technological change and global trade issues are stressing markets and forcing companies to review operations and make difficult decisions. Success in this fiercely competitive global industry, however, starts at home and we hope that all efforts will be made over the coming weeks to restore confidence, bolster demand and ensure there is long term competitiveness for this crucial sector.\u201d Ford is holding a conference call with journalists now, to explain the closure of the Bridgend site. Is Brexit a factor? European president Stewart Rowley insists the closure has nothing to do with Brexit, saying that Ford wouldn\u2019t have taken a different decision if Brexit wasn\u2019t happening. But what if there\u2019s a no-deal Brexit? Rowley says Ford will need to evaluate the business environment, and any tariff changes, if that happens. Rowley explains that Ford will source engines from other sites, and isn\u2019t planning to relocate the Welsh Dragon Engine facility elsewhere. Should the rest of Ford\u2019s UK operations be worried? Rowley says the Dagenham engine plans is a core part of the business. Rowley also reveals that he\u2019s spoken to UK business secretary Greg Clark about Bridgend. The Federation of Small Business fears that the Bridgend closure will have a devastating impact on the region\u2019s economy, as well as Ford workers and their families. Ben Cottam, head of external affairs at FSB Wales, explains: \u201cFor 40 years, Ford has been part of the economic landscape of Wales and has a long-established, embedded and innovative supply chain of smaller businesses in Wales and beyond. UK and Welsh Governments now need to move quickly and, as a priority, work with individual businesses and business organisations to gauge the potential impact and determine what support will be needed to help shore up the activity of these businesses and, if necessary, help them diversify or seek new customers. \u201cThe dynamism of the plant\u2019s employees and the supply chain are a huge asset to Wales which must not be lost. Now is a time for decisive leadership and we want to see real and demonstrable partnership and shared determination between Welsh and UK Governments to ensure that asset is not lost. FSB stands ready to lend its support to that effort. Ford says it will offer a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to support workers losing their job at its Bridgend engine factory. The car marker says: This includes helping employees with redeployment opportunities to other Ford sites in the U.K. and assisting with domestic relocation where possible, or supporting them to find new employers or pursue new opportunities, such as creating their own businesses or training for new careers. However, the reality is that Ford is one of the biggest employers in the region, so it\u2019s going to be very tough for anyone facing redundancy in the next few months. Ford don\u2019t mention Brexit in the statement announcing Bridgend\u2019s closure. Instead, they single out the loss of the contract to supply JLR with engines, and the failure to find more buyers for its new 1.5 litre offering. Ford says: Factors behind the proposed closure of Bridgend include significant underutilisation of the plant, driven by the impending end of engine production for Jaguar Land Rover, the cessation of the previous generation Ford GTDi 1.5-litre engine, and reduced global demand for the new generation Ford GTDi and Pfi 1.5-litre engine. At expected volumes, the plant also faces a cost disadvantage compared with other Ford facilities building the same engine. Significant efforts to identify new opportunities have not been successful. Now, you could speculate that Brexit uncertainty deterred automobile makers from committing to buying engines from Bridgend (for fear that they were caught up in no-deal delays at the ports). But Ford haven\u2019t stated that. Ford\u2019s president of Europe, Stuart Rowley, has insisted that the company is still committed to the UK - despite deciding to shut Bridgend. Rowley says: \u201cCreating a strong and sustainable Ford business in Europe requires us to make some difficult decisions, including the need to scale our global engine manufacturing footprint to best serve our future vehicle portfolio. \u201cWe are committed to the U.K.; however, changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead.\u201d Rowley is pledging to help staff who lose their job at Bridgend. \u201cAs a major employer in the U.K. for more than a century, we know that closing Bridgend would be difficult for many of our employees. We recognise the effects it would have on their families and the communities where they live and, as a responsible employer, we are proposing a plan that would help to ease the impact.\u201d Ford says it plans to shut Bridgend as part of a \u2018business redesign\u2019 to create a more efficient Europe-wide operation. It plans to stop making its \u201cnew-generation\u201d 1.5-litre engine in February 2020 (I think this is the new Ecoboost engine used in the Fiesta ST and Focus). Ford will then continue to manufacture engines for Jaguar Land Rover until its contract ends in September 2020, at which point production will end. Here are the key points from its announcement: Consultation starts concerning the proposed end of engine production and closure of Bridgend Engine Plant in South Wales by late 2020. Proposal supports Ford\u2019s redesign strategy to create a more efficient and focused business in Europe, with significant progress already being made. Comprehensive plan includes an enhanced employee separation programme, plus measures to help employees find new jobs or other career opportunities. Ford will remain a significant employer in the U.K.; engine production maintained at Dagenham; Dunton Technical Centre home to Ford\u2019s European sales-leading commercial vehicle business NEWSFLASH: Ford has confirmed that it plans to close the Bridgend engine plant by late 2020, as feared. More to follow.... Renault may not have given up on the other auto news of the day - the collapse of its proposed merger with Fiat-Chrysler (FCA). The French carmaker has just issued a statement, which notably speaks in the present tense about the deal (even though Fiat walked away briskly overnight). It also says that its Japanese partner Nissan was \u201cconstructive\u2019, even though French finance minister Bruno Le Maire appeared to blame Nissan for not offering enough support earlier today. Here\u2019s the statement: We are gratified by the constructive approach of Nissan and wish to thank FCA for their efforts and the Renault\u2019s Board of Directors for its continued confidence. We view the opportunity as timely, having compelling industrial logic and great financial merit, and which would result in a European based global auto powerhouse. Further, we believe it emphasises the attractivess of Renault and of the Alliance. Over in parliament, MPs have clashed over the Bridgend closure - and the extend to which Brexit is to blame. PA has the details: Trade minister Graham Stuart said the automotive industry is in \u201cmassive global flux\u201d and trying to link every decision to Brexit is to lead people astray\u201d. He was answering a question in the Commons from Labour\u2019s Geraint Davies (Swansea West), whose father worked at the Welsh Office and had convinced the car firm to move to Bridgend. The MP said the workers in the area, which voted for Brexit, \u201cdid not vote to lose their jobs\u201d and argued they \u201cdeserve a final say on the final deal and to stay in the EU and not lose their jobs\u201d. But Mr Stuart hit out at this \u201cfalse argument for a second referendum\u201d, saying that the people of South Wales wanted to leave and not hear \u201cweaselly words from the party opposite\u201d. Geriant Davies has tweeted a clip of his question too: The Unite union has now pledged to fight the closure of Ford\u2019s engine plant at Bridgend \u201cwith all its might\u201d. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey has also accused the US carmaker of treating its workers \u201cdisgracefully\u201d: \u201cFord\u2019s decision to shut its Bridgend engine plant in 2020 is a grotesque act of economic betrayal. \u201cThese workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers - this is still Ford\u2019s largest European market - through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company. \u201cFord broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000. The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle - car or van - is made in the UK. McCluskey is referring to the fact that parts made at Dagenham and Bridgend are shipped to the EU where Ford vehicles are assembled (a process that could be hampered by a disruptive Brexit) Here\u2019s the latest on Bridgend, from our Jasper Jolly: Ford will close its Bridgend engine plant by September 2020 with a loss of 1,700 jobs. Workers at the plant were informed of the decision on Thursday morning, according to sources with knowledge of the announcement. The decision is a major blow to the British car industry and to manufacturing capability in south Wales. In February, Honda announced it planned to shut its Swindon plant in 2021 with the loss of 3,500 jobs, while fellow Japanese carmaker Nissan reversed a decision to build its new X-Trail vehicle at its Sunderland plant. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors, is also cutting thousands of jobs. JLR, which runs the largest British carmaking operation, has come under pressure from a slump in sales in China. The Ford closure will leave only Toyota\u2019s Deeside engine plant and Aston Martin Lagonda\u2019s new St Athan plant as the only major carmaking locations within Wales. The Bridgend plant has manufactured engines since 1980. However, the plant, which sends petrol engines to Ford factories across Europe, was thought to be particularly at risk because a contract to make engines for JLR will end this year. Ford runs three factories in the UK, including a diesel engine plant at Dagenham, east London, and a plant making transmissions in Halewood, on the outskirts of Liverpool. The US carmaker is currently undergoing a round of steep cost-cutting around the world. In January, Ford announced widespread job losses across its European operations, saying it would consider closing plants. A formal announcement from Ford is expected later on Thursday. Parliament\u2019s Treasury committee have also just weighed in on the Woodford crisis, urging the company to stop charging management fees on its now-frozen equity income fund. Nicky Morgan MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, said: \u201cInvestors in the Woodford Fund have been locked out of accessing their cash. Yet it has been reported that Mr Woodford is taking in nearly \u00a3100,000 in management fees a day. \u201cThe suspension of trading has provided Mr Woodford with some breathing room to fix his fund; he should afford his investors the same space and waive the fund\u2019s fees while the fund is suspended. \u201cThe FCA has rightly said that it is closely watching the fund. The Treasury Committee will no doubt raise this troubling episode, and what lessons can be learnt, when we take evidence from the FCA and Bank of England.\u201d The governor of the Bank of England has issued a stern warning to the asset management sector, just days after Britain\u2019s most famous stock picker was plunged into a crisis. Mark Carney has told a conference in Tokyo that investment funds are a significant, and growing, area of financial risk. The danger, he says, is that they can amplify a downturn because they promise investors quick access to their money while often investing in relatively illiquid assets (basically, stuff that you can\u2019t sell at a moment\u2019s notice). Carney warned: Over half of investment funds have a structural mismatch between the frequency with which they offer redemptions and the time it would take them to liquidate their assets. Under stress they may need to fire sell assets, magnifying market adjustments and triggering further redemptions \u2013 a vicious feedback loop that can ultimately disrupt market functioning. Small UK investors who trusted fund manager Neil Woodford with their money will know exactly what Carney is talking about. Woodford\u2019s decision to freeze his Equity Income fund has shaken the sector, with the man himself admitting that he needs time to cut its exposure to illiquid assets. Carney doesn\u2019t single out Woodford directly, but he does flag up the property funds which froze redemptions after the 2016 Brexit vote. We have recently seen analogous situations in the UK within some niche managers and smaller markets, such as property Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). The complications would be much greater if a major asset class like emerging market economy debt were to freeze up. Here\u2019s some reaction: This is turning into a very bad day for job cuts. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff has learned that TSB bank is cutting 124 jobs, as part of an efficiency drive at its head office and branches. That\u2019s on top of the 1,700 jobs at risk in Bridgend, and the 1,800 being cut at Aviva (not sure how many are in the UK). My colleague Jasper Jolly has also heard from sources that Ford\u2019s Bridgend plant is to close by September 2020. That\u2019s a heavy blow to the area, but particularly the 1,700 workers at the site and their families, who are getting the news today. A formal announcement is expected from Ford later today. Union sources have told Sky News that the Bridgend plant is to close in 15 months time, in September 2020. Still nothing official from Ford yet. Former Welsh Government leader Carwyn Jones, who now represents Bridgend in the Welsh Assembly, fears the threat of a no-deal Brexit may have forced Ford\u2019s hand. He told the Press Association: \u201cThis has all been very sudden. There was no warning about this at all. It seems to me that any decision, whatever that decision is, would have been taken very recently. From my perspective I want to know what\u2019s going on as to with the workers and want to know a reason for the decision, and to work with Welsh government to see what we can do to help the workers here. It\u2019s the biggest single employer in the area, I remember it being built in the late 70s. There are relatively few suppliers locally but there are a number of businesses that provide services for the plant itself and they would be severely affected because for a lot of them this is the only contract they have.\u201d I do know that Ford said themselves in October publicly that a no-deal Brexit would mean they would rethink their investment strategies for the UK. \u201cIf it is the worst news here, is that part of that re-think? They will have to explain.\u201d There\u2019s dispute about how much blame should be assigned to Brexit for Bridgend\u2019s woes. Reuters points out that car exports would suffer if there was more friction at the UK border: Ford is making cuts in several markets to turn around loss-making operations but has also repeatedly warned the British government that it needs free trade to be maintained with the European Union after Brexit, the terms of which remain unclear.... Ford\u2019s British-built engines, which are shipped for fitting in vehicles in Germany, Turkey, the United States and elsewhere, could face delays and extra costs if Britain leaves the EU without securing a deal with the European Union. Owen Smith, Labour MP for Pontypridd (which is close to Bridgend in South Wales), nas tweeted: Obviously the loss of the engine contract with Jaguar Land Rover is also a huge factor. But the political uncertainty gripping the UK won\u2019t have helped Ford find alternative work, as professor David Bailey points out: Bloomberg\u2019s Lionel Laurent suggests the French government moved too slowly on the Fiat deal: Here\u2019s our news story on the end of the Fiat-Renault merger talks: Adam Price, leader of Wales\u2019s Plaid Cymru, has blasted Ford\u2019s decision to (we fear) shut the Bridgend engine plant. Price says the move would be \u201cone of the worst acts of industrial vandalism seen in the UK for decades\u201d. He\u2019s also unhappy that the US company is making the move on D-Day, when people should be celebrating co-operation and solidarity. Price tells Sky News: This is an act of crass insensitivity by Ford.. not the actions of a responsibly mature company. This is cowboy capitalism at its worst. Q: But hasn\u2019t this been coming for 3 years? Manufacturing in the UK has been struggling for several years, particularly the car sector.... Price agrees that the closure has been on the horizon -- so politicians in Westminster and Cardiff should have done more to support the Bridgend plant. He also warns Ford that workers won\u2019t take the closure lying down. There could be \u201cUK-wide industrial action, and even continent-wide industrial action\u201d, he claims, as Ford is also paying off staff in France and Germany. I don\u2019t think in any sense that this is a done deal. Ford workers in Bridgend have been arriving at work, ready to learn their plant\u2019s fate. ITV\u2019s Rupert Evelyn reckons an announcement will come around lunchtime: Renault shares have plunged by over 7% at the start of trading in Paris, after Fiat-Chrysler ended its courtship. Fiat shares have also taken a hit in Milan, down 3.5%. France\u2019s finance minister has blamed Nissan, Renault\u2019s Japanese partner, for the collapse of talks with Fiat-Chrysler. Bruno Le Maire said France was \u201copen\u201d to the merger idea, but wouldn\u2019t proceed without hearing more from Nissan. \u201cAn agreement had been reached on three of the four conditions. What remained to be obtained was the explicit support of Nissan.\u201d The blame game has begun over the collapse of the deal to create the world\u2019s third-biggest carmaker. Fiat-Chrysler is clear that Parisian politicians are to blame, telling its shareholders that \u201cthe political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully.\u201d Renault\u2019s board has revealed that its largest shareholder had indeed wanted to delay its decision on whether to back the plan. It says its directors couldn\u2019t take a decision due to \u201cthe request expressed by the representatives of the French State to postpone the vote to a later Council.\u201d But a French government official says Fiat Chrysler is at fault for pushing the deal too aggressively. Associated Press explains: The French official said France wanted to delay a vote until Tuesday to give more time to discuss it with Renault\u2019s alliance partner Nissan, and said Fiat Chrysler put \u201cmassive pressure\u201d to quickly take the offer or leave it. Another jobs blow: Britain\u2019s largest insurer, Aviva, has just announced 1,800 jobs across its worldwide operations. Aviva\u2019s new CEO, Maurice Tulloch, says the cuts will help save \u00a3300m per year. He told the City: Reducing Aviva\u2019s costs is essential to remain competitive and this means tough decisions and job losses which I do not take lightly. We will do all we can to minimise redundancies and support our people through this. More than half of Aviva\u2019s 30,000 global workforce are based in the UK, at offices at Norwich, Bristol, Sheffield, York, Perth and Glasgow. Unions and politicians are very alarmed about the prospect of Ford\u2019s Bridgend plant closing. Here\u2019s the GMB\u2019s Mike Payne, speaking on the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019ve known for quite a while that unless there was going to be investment in this plant, this plant was at risk. The Unite union is also concerned \u201cUnite will be meeting Ford first thing tomorrow morning and will comment further once the details of any announcement are known. Our priority is our members\u2019 jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.\u201d Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has called for the government to meet Ford and help keep the factory running: \u201cThis is worrying news, first and foremost for Ford employees and their families who are left unsure as to their futures, but also for the jobs across the supply chain and the impact on the local economy in Bridgend. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The car industry is reeling from a double-dose of bad news this morning. In the UK, workers at Ford\u2019s Bridgend engine factory are heading to work to learn the future of their plant - and the omens are not good. Ford officials have flown over from America for a company meeting, and are expected to announce the closure of the plant. It employs more than 1,500 people, with many more jobs in the local economy and supply chains also dependent on it. Bridgend\u2019s future has been in doubt for some time -- Ford cut investment last year, and recently began a voluntary layoff programme. Losing a key engine contract to supply engines for Jaguar Land Rover was another blow, while uncertainty about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU has also hurt the sector. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains what\u2019s gone wrong: The British car industry is facing a series of difficulties including a steep fall in demand for diesel vehicles and falling sales in China, previously a key growth market. At the same time, Brexit uncertainty has cast a pall over the industry, with the threat of tariffs on cars and parts travelling to and from the UK. And in another auto twist, the proposed merger between US-Italian carmaker Fiat Chrysler and French rival Renault has just collapsed. Fiat-Chrysler has blamed France\u2019s politicians (Renault\u2019s biggest shareholder) for thwarting the deal. It says: It has become clear that the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully. The merger would have created a powerful new force in the car industry, at a time of dramatic and volatile change. It would have let the two firms share the cost of developing cutting-edge technologies such as self-driving vehicles and electric cars. More to follow.... Also coming up today It\u2019s a busy day in the economic world - the European Central Bank is setting interest rates, releasing new economic forecasts, and pondering what more it can do to support the eurozone economy. Bank of England governor Mark Carney speaks in Toyko in a couple of hours, at the Institute of International Finance spring meeting. Trade tensions and geopolitics will be in focus too, as China\u2019s president Xi visits Russia. America is releasing new trade figures too, which may show whether the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed recently have hurt demand. We\u2019ll also have an eye on Arcadia, after Sir Philip Green was forced to delay a creditors\u2019 vote after some landlords refused to back his rescue plan.
