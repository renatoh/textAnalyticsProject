It wasn't just the sheer number of woman-friendly books and magazines \u2013 though that in itself was amazing. It was the sense of community: the reading groups, the board where local organisations posted their events, the activism, the friendships formed. Feminist bookshops are a lot more than stacks of Steinem or hooks. They're often the centerpieces of local feminist organising. But like many independent bookshops, feminist outlets are in trouble. Deep trouble. Last year, Book Woman \u2013 the only feminist bookstore in Texas \u2013 almost had to shut its doors because of a lack of funds. This year, its In Other Words in Portland, Oregon. The bookshop recently put out a call on their website, on blogs and via email asking people to help them raise $11,000 in order to keep their doors open. We know it sounds crazy that a small bookstore in Portland could raise this much money in such a short time, however our community of locals, out-of-town family and friends, as well as feminists nationwide have responded in full force to our plea. They are making online donations, swarming through our doors to support the store by doing their shopping and attending events, and by getting the word out to their own communities that we need help. And its working. We've made nearly $7,000 in the five days since we announced our financial crisis. Clearly, In Other Words is an institution that our community will not let go under. The organising around In Other Words has indeed been amazing \u2013 feminist blogs have posted about the bookstore's situation, and I've received dozens of emails from activists asking for donations for the store. We can keep this store \u2013 this community \u2013 open. After all, we did it with Book Woman; in just a few months the store raised nearly $40,000 and was able to stay open. Because again, this is about more than just books. In an interview with Feministing, Heather Ites \u2013 one of the proprieters of the oldest feminist bookstore in North America, the Amazon Bookstore Cooperative \u2013 said, \"Literature has been historically seen as a liberating space, a transgressive space, and having that filtered through a corporate entity like large bookstores or online mega-giants is scary, scary indeed to me.\" And to me. So the next time you're thinking of buying a feminist book, instead of heading to the nearest shopping centre, consider heading to your local feminist joint. As Ites noted, \"Without free spaces, free thinking spaces, this world is in dire trouble. And with more and more independent booksellers going out of business, it is more important than ever to be conscious of what you are actually supporting.\" Besides, you'll probably find a lot more there than a book \u2013 you'll find a community."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
