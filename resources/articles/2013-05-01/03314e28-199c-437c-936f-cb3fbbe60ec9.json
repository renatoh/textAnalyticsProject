In the 60s, Sir Matt Busby ran Manchester United with a laissez-faire policy, which allowed geniuses such as George Best to flourish. Bill Shankly, of Liverpool legend, stood for working-class solidarity and passion. Brian Clough \u2013 \"Old Big 'Ead\" \u2013 turned arrogance and cussedness into a way to win. So what about Sir Alex Ferguson, who announced his retirement last week after 27 years in charge of Manchester United? Like Shankly, he turned his players into a \"all for one and one for all\" community. He bullied and swaggered like Clough, glaring at referees, baiting rival managers. And if Busby indulged Best to a fault, Ferguson turned a blind eye to the excesses of his own talisman, Eric Cantona. It was quite an act. Now that he is going, even old enemies such as the Arsenal boss, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, have been generous in their tributes. Ferguson has finally declared a truce with the rest of the world. Football will miss the greatest manager in the game's history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
