She will fly from Cape Town, where she lives, to Mumbai and Bangalore. Once in India, however, she is not sure how to travel on to Mysore. Safety is her main concern (and her mother's!). What is the safest, not necessarily the cheapest, way to get from Bangalore airport to her destination, and where she should stay? Lina Kantor, Zimbabwe Mysore is a charming city, with a fantastic palace that dominates the skyline as well as notable temples and colourful bazaars. From Bangalore airport, your daughter can take a taxi to the train station for \u00a32 (roughly 170 rupees), pre-paid in the airport. From there, at least four trains a day go to Mysore. The journey takes four hours and costs \u00a33-6, depending on the class and speed of train. There are also dozens of buses daily, costing around \u00a33 and leaving from the bus station, which is next to the train station. This journey is not especially dangerous, but your daughter should be careful, avoid travel after dark and buy the highest class of train ticket available. In Mysore, the Hotel Palace Plaza (00 91 821 2430034; hotelpalaceplaza.com) is right by the maharajah's palace. It is modern, safe and comfortable. Single rooms with air conditioning start at \u00a311 per head a night. Please may I have your advice on what money I'll need on a visit to Poland. I know I will have to pay cash to rent an apartment, and I am happy to do so. But on other occasions can I use my Visa card, or do you always need cash? I have heard that euro travellers' cheques are not widely accepted there. As my stay will cover a weekend I want to make sure that I don't go short of money. Frank Breen, by email For minimum money worries in Poland avoid travellers' cheques. You generally need to exchange these at banks, which will be little use to you as they don't normally open at weekends. The widespread Kantor private exchange offices change cash and offer cash advances on credit cards, but often don't change travellers' cheques. Given that cash machines are widespread and credit cards are accepted in many places, your best bet is to take some cash (pounds are fine for this), a debit card for withdrawing additional funds and a credit card for any other general expenses. If you have a Mastercard or Visa you can check the locations of their cash machines on their websites. With a bit of luck, I'll be heading to Tokyo on a business trip in February. Our business contact has already warned that 'there will be no sun', but it should be a fascinating place. Where should I go if I have a few days to explore? I'd like to see the highlights of the city (if there are any). I also want to visit the countryside, using public transport, do some walking and perhaps stay one or two nights outside Tokyo. Finally, what are the best low to middle price places to stay? Willem Nissink, by email Tokyo is a fantastic, chaotic, exciting place to explore. It is easy to get around by public transport, and countryside is easily accessible. Unlikely as it may sound, there is no better introduction to Tokyo than a trip to the Tsukiji Central Fish Market. Get an early start and stroll round this huge, colourful and smelly place, which offers the world's best sushi breakfast. The imposing temples and more understated shrines of Asakusa make another essential stop. You'll need more time to get to the Imperial Palace and the Higashi Gyoen royal garden, but they have tranquillity and space in a city where both are precious. The best way to get a feel for Tokyo's pulse is to people-watch. If you're there over a weekend, head for Harakuju, a district where the youth of the city hang out. By night, bar crawling round Shinjuku, Shibuya or Roppongi is great fun. If you have time to get of out of the city, try the religious centre of Kamakura, the Shizen Kyoikuen woods or the coastal resort of Izu-hanto. You'll be visiting outside the height of the season for climbing Mount Fuji, but a day trip to the Hakone area can include cable-car rides and soaking in an onsen, or hot-spring bath. All of these are a short distance from Tokyo.
