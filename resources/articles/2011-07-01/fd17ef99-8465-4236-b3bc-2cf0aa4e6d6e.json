In the event, the white paper was published on 11 July (A plan for partnerships, 20 July, page 1, Reshaping services special supplement). \u2022 A still photo from the forthcoming film of The Inbetweeners showed Will, Simon, Neil and Jay wandering wide-eyed in a supposed Cretan party resort. The female actor pictured with them should have been named as Eloise Joseph, who plays a PR person, not Emma Louise Cargill, who plays a hotel guest (The not-bleeding-likely lads, 15 July, page 5, Film &amp; music)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
