Hardaker was left out of Leeds\u2019 squad to face Warrington Wolves on Friday night after details came to light of an alleged incident involving the 23-year-old and his Leeds team-mate Elliot Minchella. He was replaced by the teenager Ashton Golding, who made his first appearance of the season instead of Hardaker. Minchella was also not involved in the match, although he was initially not in Leeds\u2019 squad for the game, unlike Hardaker. The pair are expected to be interviewed by police in the coming days after an alleged assault involving a 22-year-old man in Leeds. The Rhinos released a brief statement on Friday night which detailed that both players are co-operating with police. It read: \u201cThe club have been made aware of an incident in which it is alleged that Leeds Rhinos players Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella were involved. \u201cBoth the club and the individuals concerned are co-operating fully with the police investigation. \u201cUntil such time as that investigation is concluded neither the club nor the players involved are able to make any further comment.\u201d West Yorkshire Police have confirmed they are speaking to two men concerning the incident, which occurred after a break-in and assault on Burley Road in the city on 3 February. Police did release images of two men but they have since been removed after fresh information came to light."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
