More than two dozen employers are expected at the fair in Leeds prison, formerly called Armley, which is modelled on graduate recruitment fairs hosted in universities. The prison piloted the idea in March, when 15 inmates found jobs. Several went straight into work on the Monday following their release. \"I've been in and out of prison for 20 years and I've never seen anything like this,\" one prisoner said at the time. Another added: \"There are lots of things here I'm interested in. I've got no excuses now.\" Employers invited back for today's fair include shoe repairers Timpson; Leeds libraries; Leeds City Credit Union; and Kier Construction, as well as charities the Prince's Trust and Turning Point. All of Leed's 1,000 prisoners have been invited to the event, and last time 150 attended. The jobs fair is part of a drive by the government to get employers more actively involved in training and recruiting prisoners. At Leeds, inmates are also offered a motor mechanics course run by Toyota. Other prisons run similar work schemes. Wandsworth prison, in south London, works with Cisco and other companies to offer prisoners IT training. Construction company Bovis also works inside Wandsworth, training prisoners to fill skills shortages in the construction industry. Leeds inmates can also get support when they start work. The prison was able to arrange a bus pass for one ex-offender facing high travel expenses that would have make it hard for him to get to work. He is \"still in his job and doing well\", the prison said. Like many jails, Leeds also has Jobcentre Plus staff based inside the prison. Carol Borthwick, a Jobcentre Plus adviser, hailed the pilot jobs fair as a great success. \"We believe it is vital that people leaving prison have an opportunity to earn an honest living if they are going to get a chance to keep out of trouble,\" she said. \"Many of the people in here have a variety of skills that employers can make good use of, and being given a fresh chance is just what can make all the difference.\" She added: \"We are also working with our prison service colleagues to get training for those who need it, giving people the skills they need to get work when they are released. \"We know it is a challenge, but it is one we are keen to address.\" A prison service spokeswoman said it is committed to helping prisoners get back into work on release to help them reintegrate back into the community. \"Any initiative that will help offenders to successfully integrate back into society is to be welcomed and encouraged,\" she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
