And, despite Guus Hiddink again reiterating last week that he will leave as interim manager in the summer to concentrate solely on Russia, the Chelsea captain also claimed talks will be \"ongoing\" for the Dutchman to stay. Mourinho led Chelsea to consecutive Premier League titles, the FA Cup and two League Cups, but Terry is insistent that Hiddink, who oversaw Wednesday's 3-1 victory over Liverpool in the Champions League, is now the man to lead the club. \"He has a good relationship with Roman Abramovich,\" said Terry. \"Things have gone very well and I'm sure there will be talks ongoing. If we keep progressing there's only going to be one option. He's done brilliantly. He's on at us every day in training, and he doesn't let anyone get away with anything.\" Asked about stories that the players wanted Mourinho back Terry was emphatic. \"Listen, Jose was a great manager and had some great times here. But it's someone else's turn now to kick on. Mourinho is a world class manager, a lot of the players are still in contact with him... But we need stability at the club now. The manager's done brilliantly and got us playing freely. But it's down to the board to make those decisions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
