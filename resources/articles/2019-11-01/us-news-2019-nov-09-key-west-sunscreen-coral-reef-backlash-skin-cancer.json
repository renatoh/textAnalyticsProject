Fearful of accelerating the decline of the fragile Great Florida reef \u2013 the 360-mile band of living coral stretching from west of the Florida Keys to the state\u2019s Atlantic coast \u2013 commissioners believed they were taking an important step for environmental preservation. Florida\u2019s Republican politicians, however, are framing the issue as a matter of public health as they pursue legislation at the state level seeking to overturn the ban, using the same arguments that failed to stop Hawaii enacting a similar measure in 2018. In effect, the debate has become one of protecting coral reefs versus preventing skin cancer. Backed by dermatologists who cite Florida\u2019s soaring rates of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, they say it would be dangerous to ban the sale of sunscreens containing the chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate, which filter ultraviolet rays. \u201cUnfortunately, with all the wonderful things that come with our beaches and sunshine, we also rank second in the nation for the highest rate of new melanoma cases,\u201d state senator Rob Bradley, sponsor of the bill, told the senate\u2019s industry committee. He said the Key West ban, set to take effect in January 2021, would remove many of the leading brands of sunscreen from the shelves, including products by Hawaiian Tropic, Banana Boat and Coppertone that use the chemicals, and eliminate the public\u2019s \u201cfirst line of defense\u201d against skin cancer. Bradley\u2019s bill gathered momentum in Tallahassee this week, setting up a likely battle in the senate early next year that will pit the expert testimony of doctors against that of environmentalists. Johnston, meanwhile, said Bradley was wrong to portray the ordinance as downplaying the importance of sunscreen and pointed out that there were many sunscreen brands \u2013 often made by smaller firms \u2013 that could still be used. \u201cYou should use sunscreen [but] we would like you to use a safe sunscreen for our coral reef when you\u2019re in the Keys,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are literally hundreds of alternative sunscreens that do not include these two ingredients. \u201cWe have enough scientific information that says they are harmful to our last remaining coral reef and it\u2019s incumbent on us to do everything we can to protect it. The reef is the centre of our economy and tourist trade and a source of enjoyment for all of Florida and the world.\u201d Awareness of the impact of chemicals on coral reefs appears to have grown since Hawaii\u2019s 2018 decision. Coppertone, a leading sunscreen manufacturer, said its scientists were working on new formulas without oxybenzone or octinoxate, and in August the pharmacy chain CVS announced it would remove the chemicals from store-branded varieties of its sunscreens by the end of 2020. Additionally, the federal food and drug administration (FDA) issued proposed changes to sunscreen regulations in February, with a final ruling imminent, and sought information from manufacturers about the safety and effectiveness of 12 active sunscreen ingredients. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, meanwhile, published information based on scientific studies blaming chemicals in sunscreens for harm to marine life and coral reefs. \u201cStudies have shown that just a tiny drop of sunscreen can kill coral five to 20 miles offshore,\u201d said Justin Willig, conservation travel programs coordinator of the Oceanic Society, which recommends alternative \u201creef-safe\u201d sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium oxide. \u201cIt causes coral bleaching at lower temperatures, can damage the DNA which leaves the coral unable to reproduce, and some of the chemicals can become endocrine disruptors which leads to abnormal skeleton growth and eventually causes the junior corals to die.\u201d However, some dermatologists in Florida remain skeptical of the science used to promote sunscreen bans and question claims that there are suitable alternative products. \u201cI was born and raised in south Florida and have seen the skin cancer epidemic blossom to the point where one person dies every hour of melanoma in the US and another person dies of squamous cell carcinoma,\u201d said Dr Andrew Weinstein, immediate past-president of the Florida society of dermatology and dermatological surgery. \u201cThere\u2019s excellent data that shows that people who use sunscreen get fewer cutaneous tumors and also data that shows people will avoid using sunscreens they don\u2019t like. Mineral sunscreens feel chalky and sticky, and people will use less. \u201cKey West acted extremely irresponsibly. It will lead to increased cancer risks anywhere where sunscreen is not available.\u201d Deborah Foote, director of government affairs for the Sierra Club of Florida, sees evidence of a power grab in state politicians\u2019 efforts to reverse the ban. \u201cThe bigger picture is the continuing pre-emption of local jurisdictions from being able to regulate issues that are important and unique to their community,\u201d she said. \u201cParticularly with the environment there are aspects in Florida more appropriate to local decision-making. \u201cEveryone should take a deep breath and wait for the FDA outcome which is supposedly at the end of this month. If these chemicals are removed from the approved list they\u2019re going to be going away anyway.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
