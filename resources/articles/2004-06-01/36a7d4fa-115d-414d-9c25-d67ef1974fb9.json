The Latvians make their major tournament debut next Thursday, against the Czech Republic. Southampton striker Marians Pahars and goalkeeper Aleksandrs Kolinko are among the players to have been on the recent injury list, but have now been passed fully fit.. Latvia are 500-1 rank outsiders for the Euro 2004 title, but made it to Portugal at the expense of supposedly stronger teams including Poland and World Cup semi-finalists Turkey, whom they beat 1-0 at home and held to a 2-2 draw away.. Being drawn in this year's group of death, with Germany, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, however, has done little to improve the Latvians' chances. Starkovs said he had warned his players against trying to count how many points they would need to reach the tournament's second round. \"I don't do this sort of math. There are other pragmatic teams like Italy who have gone far with just a single goal. But I don't want to jinx a good result. It is important that everyone just plays their best.\" Latvian Prime Minister Indulis Emsis met with the team on Wednesday to wish them luck in Portugal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
