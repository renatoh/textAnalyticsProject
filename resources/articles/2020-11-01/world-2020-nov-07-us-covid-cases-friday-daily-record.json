At the White House, the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, was reported to have tested positive for Covid-19. On Saturday morning, Johns Hopkins University in Maryland put the total US coronavirus caseload at 9,731,198, with 235,925 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of new daily cases in the US was approaching 100,000 for the first time, while the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths had risen from 772 on 23 October to 911 on Friday. Those numbers were higher in the spring and August. States recording record daily highs on Friday included Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Utah. News of Meadows\u2019 test came days after he appeared with Donald Trump at a White House event at which numerous people did not wear masks. The president himself was previously treated for Covid-19, spending three days in hospital, after attending a White House event at which Covid mitigation measures were not enforced. Members of Trump\u2019s family, senior aides and leading Republicans have all contracted the virus after attending events in Washington and on the campaign trail. On Friday, Bloomberg News said numerous Trump campaign aides had also tested positive. Last weekend, Dr Anthony Fauci, the senior US public health expert, posted a dire warning about the coming winter and the ongoing pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a whole lot of hurt,\u201d Fauci told the Washington Post, angering the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good situation. All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.\u201d On Friday, across the US, states posted record numbers. In Illinois, faced with 20,000 new cases in two days, JB Pritzker, the governor, said a stay-at-home order was possible if the spread was not slowed \u2013 just before his office announced that he was self-isolating after being exposed to the virus for a third time. With a record 10,374 new infections reported on Friday and 10,000 deaths passed this week, Pritzker was asked if he would order people to stay home, as was required by Illinois and many other states in the spring. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bad situation [but] I\u2019m not looking at the broader mitigation of stay-at-home \u2026 as in something I would do in the coming days or a week,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee you what it looks like two weeks from now or three weeks. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d Kentucky reported 2,302 new cases and 10 more deaths on Friday. More than 1,000 people were hospitalised. Governor Andy Beshear urged 80 counties classified as \u201cred zones\u201d to follow state emergency recommendations. Last week, 68 counties were on the red-zone list. \u201cI know we\u2019ve been in this fight for so long that it\u2019s easy to get numb to the scary headlines and high case numbers,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cThat\u2019s normal. It\u2019s human nature. But you have to understand this is the most dangerous Covid-19 has ever been in the commonwealth and it is leading to more of our fellow Kentuckians becoming sick, being hospitalised and dying.\u201d Kansas added a record 5,418 new cases over two days as hospitals warned of serious strain. The increases brought the state\u2019s Covid case total to 97,633, up 5.9% from Wednesday. The state added 79 deaths to bring its total to 1,166. Deaths have more than doubled since mid-September. Kansas\u2019s health department head, Dr Lee Norman, said cases \u201care just skyrocketing\u201d because people are spending more time indoors, attending public events and family gatherings without being diligent about masks or social distancing. He said he was worried cases will spike again from Thanksgiving get-togethers, while many officials \u201chaven\u2019t done anything\u201d to check the surge. In Texas, a district judge upheld an order from El Paso county\u2019s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso\u2019s 34th district court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region, at the request of the state. El Paso county judge Ricardo Samaniego ordered a two-week shutdown of non-essential activities late last week. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early 20th century, city and county officials had authority to respond as they \u201cthought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities\u201d. Ken Paxton, Texas\u2019s attorney general, has argued that Samaniego\u2019s order is illegal because it goes against Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s statewide order to reopen businesses. Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general\u2019s office, said the state would appeal against Moody\u2019s order. El Paso joins 10 other Texas cities, including Houston, San Antonio and multiple communities in the Rio Grande Valley, to receive aid from the Department of Defense at the request of state officials."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
