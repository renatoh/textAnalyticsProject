The last thing he wants to do at this stage of the match is serve that second serve. He\u2019s annoyed with the close line calls that have gone against him and the last one has bamboozled him into a double fault. In this best-of-five tussle with Australian world No240 Chris O\u2019Connell, the score sits at 5-7, 6-3, 5-6 (15-40). It\u2019s not just a critical point in this 2017 Australian Open wildcard playoff match. You could say it\u2019s a critical point in Groth\u2019s 2017 Australian summer. While the 2015 Newcombe Medalist has been a fixture on the Australian summer circuit for the previous two years, his current ranking of 180 signifies an injury-stricken 2016 that precludes him from direct entry to Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne. His schedule for the Australian summer of tennis is unclear, but contesting the January lead-in events that constitute the Australian Open (AO) Series is a big priority. \u201cFor me it\u2019s huge,\u201d Groth tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve done well in the past at those events \u2026 we only get to play in front of our home crowd a few times a year and maybe a few more times during Davis Cup.\u201d It also gives home-grown talent a chance to garner an edge over their international opponents. \u201cWe practice here for the entire month of December at the national academy with Tennis Australia so it\u2019s a huge advantage to us that we get to hit on the courts that will be used for the tournaments.\u201d The AO Series comprises five tournaments leading into the Australian Open: the Hopman Cup (Perth) and Brisbane International in week one, followed by the World Tennis Challenge (Adelaide), the Hobart International and the Sydney International in week two. 2017 is distinct in that its the first Australian summer in a decade to simultaneously feature both Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in the draws for the official lead-in tournaments. Federer and Nadal\u2019s appearances in the AO Series (Federer is competing in the Hopman Cup and Nadal the Brisbane International) also signal their return to competition after injuries that kept one or both of them absent from the bulk of the major tennis tournaments in the second half of 2016. Geoff Quinlan, tournament director of the Brisbane International, says Nadal\u2019s absence from tennis in general this season will stimulate extra anticipation when he arrives for tournament play in Australia at the start of the new year. \u201cThe other part is Rafa hasn\u2019t played in Brisbane previously,\u201d says Quinlan. \u201cThat means he\u2019ll start far earlier in Australia, which is great for us and the fans.\u201d In terms of star power and top ten players, the Brisbane International is the standout of the AO Series tournaments, with its deep ensemble cast of A-list men\u2019s and women\u2019s players. Federer, who Forbes ranks as the highest-paid tennis player in the world by way of endorsements and appearance fees, buoys the Hopman Cup alongside Nick Kyrgios, and the Sydney International women\u2019s field is stacked with six players from the top ten, including world No1 Angelique Kerber. But the men\u2019s draw at the Sydney International continues to struggle to attract mainstream men\u2019s tennis stars, while the Kooyong event (formerly part of the AO Series) is a shadow of past glory when it staged finals regularly contested by the likes of Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Andy Roddick, Federer and Lleyton Hewitt. Rival January tournaments in Auckland (featuring Serena and Venus Williams), Chennai, Qatar and Shenzhen mean that the status and star power of the AO Series, like any other swing on an ever-globalising tournament calendar, is transient. To attract crowds, viewers and sponsors, the modernisation of the Australian summer of tennis is a perennial endeavour for Tennis Australia. Professor Hans Westerbeek, Dean at the college of sport and exercise science at Victoria University, says sports generally are innovating in response to the saturation of sporting events on the annual calendar. \u201cIf you don\u2019t buy a ticket to this, there\u2019s always the option to buy a ticket to something else,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about going beyond what historically for the last 20 or 30 years has been the primary product.\u201d The \u2018True Blue\u2019 plexicushion prestige court surface that\u2019s been universal at the AO and AO Series events since 2008 is an emblem of how Australia\u2019s summer swing has evolved in this Big 4-dominated decade. In the present era, IBM\u2019s big data and real-time analytics are profoundly deepening fan engagement with the sport \u2013 you almost need a phone in your hand to appreciate the full coverage of a tennis contest now as fans consume the sport through traditional broadcast television channels alongside enhanced digital content streams and social media platforms. The multi-purpose Pat Rafter Arena and Perth Arena mean that the AO Series is increasingly becoming an enclaved arena-tennis spectacle for prime time, and trials in Fast 4 Tennis signpost the need to innovate and experiment with the format to ensure contemporary fans\u2019 attentions. The AO Series \u2013 which lacks the prize money and points standings of the longer-standing US Open Series \u2013 offers players an opportunity to acclimatise to Australian conditions, get match-hardened and pick up rankings points, according to Tennis Australia. It\u2019s one of the many diverse series of swings on the tour with its flavour, according to ATP World Tour spokesperson, Simon Higson. \u201cI think if you asked the players, they would also identify the Australian tournaments as presenting some of the toughest playing conditions, especially with the extreme heat we\u2019ve seen on occasion in recent years,\u201d he says. Quinlan likens the AO Series relationship to the AO with the way the Spring Racing Carnival leads into the Melbourne Cup. \u201cIt promotes the sport and the event and it\u2019s a bit of form guide that creates a patchwork quilt of stories within stories leading up to these iconic events,\u201d he says. Back at Melbourne Park, there\u2019s a muddy sky looming over court eight and the yellow and blue \u2018AO\u2019 flags peppering the grounds are whipping thornily. Groth\u2019s damp green and gold T-shirt is pasted to him and his cap is fashioned au contraire enough to oxygenate suspicions he\u2019s dressed by Lleyton Hewitt. He rolls in his second serve and the five-shot rally ends meekly when his malnourished topspin forehand dips into the bottom of the net. At the change of ends, Groth smashes his racquet into the True Blue surface five times and tosses it into the fence behind him. The match isn\u2019t tilting in his favour and the big-serving Groth ultimately succumbs to his opponent. He\u2019s done enough to impress TA managing director Wally Masur however and it\u2019s decided that Groth will receive a discretionary wildcard into the 2017 Australian Open on the basis of his Davis Cup performance in 2016. And after a run of frustrating injuries participation in the AO Series could just be the kickstart Groth needs \u2013 for the Australian summer of tennis, and for 2017."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
