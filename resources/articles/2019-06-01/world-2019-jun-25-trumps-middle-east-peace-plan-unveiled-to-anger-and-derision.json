A conference hall of regional officials \u2013 with no Israelis or Palestinians present \u2013 was the first to hear details of the US-brokered deal, an economic blueprint that shreds decades of diplomacy and which even its mooted financial backers seemed reluctant to embrace. The centrepiece appears to be a call for donors to contribute $50bn to kickstart the Palestinian economy and win the buy-in of neighbouring Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon, which would eventually open direct trade links with the West Bank and Gaza. There has been no sign of a political dimension to the proposal, hailed as the brainchild of Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner. Critics across the region suggested the US was replacing the long-agreed \u201cland for peace\u201d formula with a blunt new \u201cmoney for peace\u201d that attempted to buy off the Palestinian cause. Kushner said his plan was \u201cthe opportunity of the century\u201d for the Palestinians but their acceptance was a precondition for peace. \u201cAgreeing on an economic pathway forward is a necessary precondition to resolving the previously unsolvable political issues,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be clear, economic growth and prosperity for the Palestinian people are not possible without an enduring and fair political solution to the conflict \u2013 one that guarantees Israel\u2019s security and respects the dignity of the Palestinian people.\u201d Acknowledging the scepticism about his father-in-law\u2019s policy in the region, he said: \u201cMy direct message to the Palestinian people is that despite what those who have let you down in the past say, President Trump and America have not given up on you.\u201d Nancy Okail, the executive director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said: \u201cThe Palestinian issue is primarily political, and pouring money into it won\u2019t solve it. Kushner\u2019s plan is indicative of his lack of understanding of the history and dynamics in the region, offering a simplistic and unviable, immoral non-solution to a longstanding, complex issue.\u201d Hours before the official \u201cPeace to Prosperity\u201d conference dinner in the Bahraini capital, Manama, on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia released a statement reiterating its support for the two-state solution. This has been the bedrock of past discussions between Israelis and Palestinians, underwritten by successive administrations in Riyadh and Washington. Saudi Arabia is an ally of the Trump administration and a nominal supporter of the conference. Its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had forged a close understanding with Kushner in the months before the conference; both are understood to see the 71-year-old conflict through a similar lens. During Kushner\u2019s time as Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, core demands of the Israeli rightwing have been implemented. US aid to Palestine has been slashed, the bitterly contested city of Jerusalem declared as Israel\u2019s capital, Palestinian diplomatic missions closed in Washington and US missions closed in the West Bank and Gaza. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a \u2018land for peace\u2019 formula addressing a decades-old occupation and siege to a \u2018money for peace\u2019 recipe for disaster,\u201d said HA Hellyer, a senior associate fellow of the Royal United Services Institute and the Atlantic Council. \u201cThe needs and rights of the Palestinians \u2013 the occupied \u2013 are now openly and explicitly disregarded by the Trump administration with such transparency that such a \u2018money for peace\u2019 recipe for disaster [to them] is a logical conclusion,\u201d Hellyer said. \u201cThere are precious few in the Arab world who are willing to invest much political capital to address and solve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but that doesn\u2019t translate to support for this. If that were the case, we would see high-level delegations, for example, going to the Bahraini workshop. Instead, Arab states are trying to send as low-level diplomats as possible.\u201d Sir John Jenkins, a former Middle East director for the Foreign Office, said torpor across Palestinian politics had contributed to a loss of faith in the existing peace model. He said Palestine\u2019s political structure had collapsed and there was \u201cno Palestinian national narrative any more\u201d, pointing to the \u201cbureaucratisation and demoralisation of Fatah\u201d, the \u201cfutilely belligerent\u201d Hamas in charge of Gaza, and the fact that the Palestinian Authority that runs parts of the West Bank was \u201cwidely distrusted and despised as corrupt by many Palestinians\u201d. Jenkins said: \u201cAdd to this the failure of the Arab uprisings, the consequent discrediting of political Islamism, the collapse of Arab nationalism and the rise of securitised authoritarianism, and the old context within which the Palestinian national cause sat has also vanished. No one has replaced it with anything satisfactory. This is a failure of the political imagination.\u201d He said this vacuum had been filled with \u201cthe promise of economic development, as if that will make the unorganised but still widespread and powerful Palestinian yearning for a state, or at least a political community, go away. I think that\u2019s a misreading. Economic development gets you so far \u2013 but then what?\u201d He added of mooted Arab benefactors: \u201cI can\u2019t see them simply signing on the dotted line unless there is some sort of political horizon. The Palestinian issue retains a distinctive power to mobilise many Arabs emotionally. It\u2019s hard to see why the Kurds and others are allowed to realise national aspirations but not the Palestinians. And Iran would accuse them of selling out the instant they signed. Why give them the satisfaction?\u201d Hellyer said a two-state solution, already diluted, may become even less viable in the absence of meaningful political engagement. \u201cIf the Israelis continue along this present course of action, they make the alternative of a one-state solution more and more inevitable, where the Palestinian struggle for national self-determination in a state is transformed into a civil rights struggle in a single state alongside Israelis.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
