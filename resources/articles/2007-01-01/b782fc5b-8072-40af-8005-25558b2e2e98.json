And it was, dramatically, the real thing: a tautly directed cracker. Plays within plays are hard to pull off on radio, where you only have voices to guide you to who's who, and Stoppard's includes an extra trick, filling it full of characters not quite telling the truth, especially to themselves. Harriet Walter as Charlotte, starring in her husband's play about adultery, was especially impressive in the clashes in the play-within-the-play with her co-star, Max, played by Roger Allam. Max finds Charlotte's passport at their house, and so realises she isn't abroad on a business trip. He had found it at home once before, when she claimed to be in Amsterdam. \"I must say, I take my hat off to you, coming home with Rembrandt placemats for your mother,\" he says, spitting each word out. \"It's those touches that lift adultery out of the moral arena and make it a matter of style.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
