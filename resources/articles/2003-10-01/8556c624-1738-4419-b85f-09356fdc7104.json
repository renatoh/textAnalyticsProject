I sussed him out'", "bodyText": "Question: How old are you? Answer: Fourteen. Question: You were 13 when this happened though, right? She nods. Question: Tell me what happened. Answer: I was bored after school and went on to this chatroom that I visit sometimes. I don't spend hours on it, but just when I'm bored. I sometimes talk to my friends from school, and we all meet up in this chat room. Question: Is this a teenager's chat zone? Answer: Yes, it's on MSN. Question: When did you meet Lindsell? Answer: He came on and asked if I would like to chat, and I invited him into to my chat zone. He was asking my age and we got chatting. Question: Was he trying to make friends? Answer: He was trying to get my email address and phone number, but after a while I thought he was weird. He kept changing his age between 15 and 19, and then started sending nasty emails saying, I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna XXXX you and stuff. So I deleted them and stopped talking to him and blocked him from my account. But he changed his email address and I let him back in. He changed after I blocked him out the first time and started being really nice. In the end I decided I didn't want to talk to him though. He was weird. The way he talked and the way he spelt was not like other teenagers. Then he asked if he could ring me and told me he had cancer, so if I ever spoke to him on the phone and thought his voice was weird it was because of the cancer steroids he was taking. Question: How much personal information did you give him? Answer: He was asking me lots of questions and what I looked like and what my school uniform was like. I didn't give him my number or anything, but I told him what my uniform was like and the colour and stuff. Then the police told me he went to my school's website and found my school on internet maps. He must have been trying to find me. Question: Do you think you had a lucky escape? Answer: I thought I was lucky. I sussed him out. I thought he was weird and was calling him a freak and stuff. He wanted to set up a meeting. Question: Do you think he was trying to manipulate you? Answer: He was trying. It's just the little things I didn't think mattered like my uniform. It's scary that someone was doing that. I think there needs to be some proof that the person is who he says he is before you can trust them or chat to them about yourself too much. I hardly go onto chatrooms anymore and don't give out my email. The girl's mother was also interviewed. Question: Tell me what happened to your daughter. Answer: She likes going onto the internet to chat. Kids can't just go out and about like they used to. I suppose it is just a sign of the times. This man made contact as a teenager, but then started sending rude and threatening emails, so my daughter stopped contact. He then changed his email address and got back in somehow. Question: Your daughter is quite sensible, though? Answer: This was very dangerous for her, but she wised up. She is sensible and didn't actually give out much personal information. Still, from the school uniform alone, this man could have been sitting outside her school waiting for her. He knew what she looked like from her profile on the chat room. You don't think this kind of thing is going to happen to you. Me and my daughter have a good relationship and she speaks to me about lots of things. Question: Was he trying to manipulate your daughter? Answer: After the rude and threatening emails he started being nice and saying he was really sorry, and he would never hurt her and the like. He then said he had cancer. Even I was taken in and felt sorry for him when my daughter was calling him a freak. I thought he had cancer. If I was taken in, someone more vulnerable than my daughter would be easy prey. The police say he went further with a lot of the girls, trying to abduct them. Who's to say what could've happened? I think we have been very lucky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
