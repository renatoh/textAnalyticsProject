In recent episodes, the pregnant Helen has been refused bail for stabbing her abusive husband and agrees to move to a dedicated mother and baby unit (MBU) in a prison miles away from her home and young child. Gove told the Radio Times that the Radio 4 show and its \u201cgripping\u201d storyline was \u201crequired listening in our house\u201d. \u201cAs well as being superb drama, it has exemplified one of the virtues of public service broadcasting,\u201d he said. \u201cHelen\u2019s story has brought welcome attention to the real problems many women face from coercive and controlling men. Now Helen\u2019s plight has shone a light on the position of women in our prisons and reinforces the case for reform.\u201d In February, the prime minister, David Cameron, called for a rethink of the way the prison system treats pregnant women and mothers with babies. Ministry of Justice figures suggest 100 babies spent time living with their mothers in prisons in 2015. The Archers\u2019 storyline, which first introduced Helen\u2019s partner Rob as a charming man two years ago before slowly revealing his violent and coercive nature, has already led to a campaign to support \u201creal-life Helens\u201d raising more than \u00a3130,000. Following the controversial episode in which Helen was provoked into stabbing Rob, listeners have learned that she faces either six years for wounding with intent or 12 for attempted murder, as well as the certainty of giving birth while in custody. According to new figures, audiences requested 3,559,940 downloads of The Archers via BBC iPlayer Radio in March 2016, a 42% increase from the previous year. In February, Gove said: \u201cWe need radically to reform how we treat women offenders. At the moment, too many women are in jail. A prison sentence not only punishes them, but also makes life much tougher for their children.\u201d With only 64 MBU places in England and Wales and fewer prisons for women than men, women are often held further from their homes than men, even though they tend to serve shorter sentences on average. The Archers\u2019 editor, Sean O\u2019Connor, who will shortly leave the Radio 4 hit to take over at the BBC1 soap EastEnders, made a direct comparison between the two very different shows. \u201cIn the past, it\u2019s been soaps like EastEnders who have covered women in prison. We aimed to show how shocking it is when you are hit by the full force of the law. And we wanted to represent the greater injustice women experience in the prison system.\u201d The BBC director general, Tony Hall, has already praised the storyline for the show achieving its highest appreciation ratings in the show\u2019s 65-year history. \u201cThe much talked-about Archers storyline has brought about unprecedented public focus on domestic violence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that our programmes can tackle difficult issues \u2013 and the public seem to agree.\u201d The programme has worked closely with domestic violence charities such as Women\u2019s Aid and Refuge to develop the story. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said: \u201cNow in custody, Helen is more isolated than ever ... Like many abused women, Helen is struggling to resist Rob\u2019s narrative: that everything is her fault and that she is a bad mother. I hope that, as the storyline continues, Helen receives the empathy she deserves.\u201d Following Sunday night\u2019s episode, Refuge tweeted its support. Women\u2019s Aid has previously reported a 20% increase in calls to the National Domestic Violence Helpline in the year to February. Polly Neate, chief executive, said she thought this was \u201cin part down to the \u2018Archers\u2019 effect\u2019.\u201d In speaking to the Radio Times, Gove would not say whether Titchener should be freed. \u201cJudicial independence is a precious thing. It\u2019s for the court hearing each case to determine the outcome,\u201d said a spokesman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
