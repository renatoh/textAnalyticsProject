He described the goalkeeper\u2019s move from the champions Chelsea as a \u201cvery serious\u201d statement by Arsenal and said: \u201cHis ambition is still there even though he has won everything in England and in Europe. Those type of signings give a lift to the whole team. He\u2019s not just a good goalkeeper. He has experience and ambition. The decision he made to come here after being a legend at Chelsea was not easy. \u201cI don\u2019t think many of them would do it at his age. He is still hungry and he wants to prove himself at the top again and it\u2019s a really good decision for us. He could have gone to another league and said: \u2018My name is here forever in the Premier League with Chelsea.\u2019 And you know that there will be some criticism coming [to him]. He just wants to take this chance and say: \u2018I\u2019ve got another chapter with a massive club and I want to make Arsenal champions.\u2019 \u201cWhen you get to know him I have no doubt he will handle that criticism. He is very cool, he\u2019s been training very well and he\u2019s not here just to sit on his back. He wants to compete, he wants to keep winning and he\u2019s a good lad.\u201d The midfielder was speaking after Arsenal\u2019s squad arrived in Singapore for a pre-season tournament in which they will play a national side, Everton and Stoke City. The manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, stated on Monday that he hoped to add another one or two signings but had never been interested in signing Raheem Sterling from Liverpool because his squad has enough attacking talent. Arteta said: \u201cThis is a process that started three or four years ago. Suddenly the club\u2019s perspective and potential changed,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of selling the best players, they decided to keep the players and keep adding the quality every year. Once we do that we start to show more consistency, start to win trophies , confidence, atmosphere, everything gets better.\u201d Arteta, who at 33 is the same age as Cech, is hoping this will be a significant period in his career after he started only six matches last season because of injury and the emergence of players such as the young French midfielder Francis Coquelin. Arteta signed a new one-year contract at the start of July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
