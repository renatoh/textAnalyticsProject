The figures, seen by interested parties in the electronic 'virtual data room' set up by investment bank Lazards, show the titles have survived the advertising recession better than many analysts expected. It may force bidders to top the \u00a3700m mark in the auction. All potential buyers have now visited the 'data room' and had face-to-face meetings with Telegraph executives. Many media assets sell for up to 20 times earnings, which in the Telegraph's case would make it worth closer to \u00a31 billion. However, a buyer is likely to be hit by a large tax bill and could face legal action from shareholders trying to recover money they allege was wrongly paid to former chief executive Conrad Black. The extent of a new owner's liability is unclear, but it could run into millions. Despite this, the profit projections may encourage bidders. In 2003, the last full year for which figures are available, the papers made around \u00a334m. Potential buyers also say they can make savings by cutting back 'office' costs in the paper's marketing and advertising departments. Lazard, appointed by Hollinger International to sell all or part of the group, has told bidders to submit third-round bids by 10 May. US venture capital group KKR is bidding for all of Hollinger. So too is German publisher Axel Springer, which owns Bild newspaper. It has joined forces with American finance house Hellman Friedman. The Barclay brothers are bidding for the Telegraph titles, as is DMGT, owner of the Daily Mail, which has teamed up with Cinven, although it did not table a joint bid. Mail executives plan to sell the papers on to Cinven should their bid be accepted by Hollinger but blocked by Ofcom, the media regulator. Other bidders include private equity groups 3i and Candover. Executives at Axel Springer were angered by comments made by Express proprietor Richard Desmond last week. Desmond taunted Telegraph managers about the prospect of German ownership, describing them as 'Nazis'. The new Telegraph owner would have to work with Desmond, who jointly owns the printing press at West Ferry where the papers are published. Axel would not comment on the remarks but sources say the company has quizzed Telegraph executives, led by Jeremy Deedes, about how the British public would react if it bought the Telegraph."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
