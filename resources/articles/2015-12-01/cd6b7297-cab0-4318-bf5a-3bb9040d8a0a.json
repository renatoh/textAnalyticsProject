Those mishaps were, of course, unintentional. Here, Mischief Theatre know exactly what they are doing, playing on the audience\u2019s pleasure in backstage and onstage catastrophes. With their sleeper West End hit, The Play That Goes Wrong, Mischief have neatly mined the comic possibilities of a creaky country house murder mystery being assaulted by the combined egos of the Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society, a group of amateur actors so inept that what can go wrong, inevitably does. Doors refuse to open, scenery collapses and performers upstage each other as private grudges create mayhem. There\u2019s more of the same on offer in this harmlessly goofy entertainment that gets the audience onside even before the action begins with some likable to-and-fro and a comic mobile-phone announcement. It comes with the added benefit that pretty well everyone is familiar with JM Barrie\u2019s story about Wendy, John and Michael\u2019s trip to Neverland in the company of the obstreperous Tinkerbell (whose tutu is attached to the mains supply with electrifying results) and the boy who refuses to grow up, and seems unlikely ever to do so, given the amount of concussion sustained. There are unlimited possibilities for mishaps where stage flying is involved. When Gladys Cooper played Peter Pan in the 1920s, she had rows with the stage hands, who took their revenge during the flying sequences by bouncing her off the scenery like a wrecking ball. Here the thin line between the arrogance of the Peter Pan character and the amateur actor playing him is cleverly excavated, as Peter constantly, and not entirely inexplicably, finds himself dangling upside down. Directed by Adam Meggido, this is a slicker affair than The Play That Goes Wrong, and has the added bonus of the presence of Tom Edden as a narrator constantly upstaged by his chair. There\u2019s good work, too, from Dave Hearn as Max, who has only been cast because his uncle put up the money; Nancy Wallinger as Annie, a multiple quick-change failure, and Ellie Morris as the stagefright-afflicted Lucy, who believes in fairies. It\u2019s formulaic, but it delivers. Apollo theatre, London, until 31 January. Buy tickets at theguardianboxoffice"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
