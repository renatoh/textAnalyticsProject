He warned that black and ethnic minority players who would like a future in the game after retirement are \"demoralised\" by the status quo. Webb believes the paucity of non-white managers in the country is an issue which needs to be looked at as a matter of urgency. The Premier League is one of the most culturally diverse divisions on the planet but has been overwhelmingly dominated by white managers. Norwich City's Chris Hughton is the only black manager in the top flight and Blackpool's Paul Ince and Charlton Athletic's Chris Powell are the only black managers in the Football League. Chris Kiwomya departed as Notts County manager on Sunday by mutual consent after eight months. Webb, who has been meeting senior players during a visit to England, suggested there was a growing disenchantment among professionals. \"There's a lot of young players coming through,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I understand that more than 30% of the league is made up of people of African descent and over 71 different nationalities playing in the Premier League, but it's not reflected, they're not getting an opportunity [to manage]. \"Many of them are becoming very demoralised and these are issues of course that we hope the FA will take on and that of the Premier League. The [English] game must reflect society and the community. It doesn't do so.\" The Football Association chairman, Greg Dyke, was criticised by the board member Heather Rabbatts for a perceived lack of diversity in his commission on the future of the English game. His initial eight-strong panel was entirely comprised of white men, although Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand was added to the group. The players Webb spoke to included Reading's Jason Roberts, who has been at the forefront of attempts to boost the number of black coaches and managers. Webb also talked during his visit to Manchester City's Yaya Tour\u00e9, who said he suffered racist abuse from CSKA Moscow fans during a Champions League match in Russia last week. Tour\u00e9 provided Webb with details of what happened in Moscow and, according to Concacaf which is headed by Webb, agreed to assist with anti- racism educational programmes planned by Fifa's task force."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
