The lucrative five-year deal with SportPesa, agreed in 2017, was one of the most high-profile and increasingly controversial of Premier League club sponsorships by gambling companies, which has prompted campaigners to warn of the social costs and \u201cdire consequences\u201d being caused by the increasing \u201cgamblification\u201d of football. The early termination of the deal, which was understood to be for \u00a37m a season, an Everton record, follows a strategic review of the club\u2019s commercial operations led by the chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale. She responded to a question at the club\u2019s AGM last month by saying that \u201cin an ideal world\u201d they would prefer a \u201cdifferent type of sponsor\u201d than a gambling company. Everton\u2019s desire to increase their activities and revenues with sponsors, in line with the club\u2019s development and investment under the ownership of Farhad Moshiri, together with restrictions which apply when a sponsor is a gambling company, are understood to have been factors in the club approaching SportPesa to end the sponsorship early. An Everton spokesperson said: \u201cThis has been a difficult decision but one that allows us to best deliver on our commercial plan and to grasp the new opportunities now open to us. \u201cThe club would like to thank SportPesa for all of the work that has been done together. Our partnership has seen our first team visit Africa on two occasions, as well as former players and club staff take part in numerous activations in the region. This has allowed us to grow our own footprint in Africa and further strengthen our special relationship with the continent.\u201d SportPesa, founded by a partnership of Bulgarian casino operators and wealthy, influential Kenyans in Nairobi six years ago, grew rapidly by promoting online gambling in the country. Last summer the Kenyan government expressed concerns about young people becoming addicted to betting and falling into debt, and toughened its regulatory approach to the companies, suspending many licences, including that of SportPesa. The company had expanded quickly into the UK and Europe, agreeing partnerships with Arsenal, Southampton and Hull City, before it become the main sponsor at Everton. The company set up an office in Liverpool\u2019s Liver building, where Everton\u2019s offices are also now based, and were marketed as a partner which had \u201ca strong alignment\u201d with Everton\u2019s values, including by being involved in Everton\u2019s community programme. At their last home game, against Crystal Palace, Everton used it as the annual match clubs can use to promote a good cause by wearing on their shirts the name of their own community programme rather than SportPesa. Although the club has not committed to ending gambling sponsorships, given Barrett-Baxendale\u2019s remarks at the AGM it must be considered unlikely that the main sponsor from next season will be a betting company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
