A certain common factor brings us here and joins us together on this occasion. We are here in the simplest terms to celebrate the existence of the miracle of five lines and the four spaces they thus create, onto which we hang the symbols known to us as notes. In some far-off distant corner of unrecorded history, a group of monks, or a single monk perhaps - in which case he would have been Thelonius Monk or Egyptians perhaps, an ancient civilisation anyhow, devised a system to which many of us here owe our livelihood. But of course it doesn't rest there and is in no way quite as simple as that. History happened, and affected the way we look at the world, the way we look at events, so that Sir Edward Elgar was able to sit down and write on those five lines - plus a few others that had intruded as sophistication came along, a second symphony that would have imperial overtones, spreading tentacle-like over great pink areas of a world globe, conjuring up pictures of parades, maharajahs, elephants, thin red lines, gentlemen in pith helmets, ostrich feathers and the pomp and ceremony of a once great empire Five Lines Four Spaces An extraordinary thing this music, that symphony being but one secular and tiny isolated example. A miraculous thing actually, bound up with so much of what makes homo sapiens that species so significantly different from its primate relatives. We are all of us, from lowliest operative to highest achieving academic, subject to, and locked into, a cultural network that stretches backwards a thousand years or more. Some are much more affected by that involvement than others, but we are all involved, and tonight is one of those occasions when we present the laurels to the victors in this corner of the arts - and rest on our laurels too, safe in the knowledge that the music plays on and all is well in the musical firmament. And what is the status of that firmament I ask at this stage in our development. There is cause, I feel, both for congratulation and concern. Since I entered into the \"Affray\" last week over what might be the content of this address, I've had more attention than I've known at any time of my career of more than three decades. Well that's a good sign. At least someone is listening and appears interested in what we are doing. In some general remarks about conservative and unadventurous planning of programmes, the work of the South Bank was represented very unfavourably. I wish to correct that impression. There was a time, certainly (as with the Royal Opera three years ago, when it appeared that no possible good could ever emanate from that institution), The South Bank took a lot of flak for its programming policy. At one period it was justified, but for several years now criticism of that sort has been inappropriate as we have seen the move away from safe planning to a state in which recent South Bank celebrations have marked the work of William Walton, Henze and currently Kurtag. This year alone sees the presentation of new works from Simon Holt, Mark-Anthony Turnage and Alexander Goehr. Congratulations then to a vibrant organisation alive and well in SE1. But at the same time cause for concern. Borrowing from Churchill for a moment never before has so much instant information been made available to so many at a moments notice. And yet the erosion in our everyday life that goes on apace, makes us, I believe, much lesser beings than those great achievers who went before us. Go home tonight and read Keats, Byron. Try to imagine how many of us there are now with the necessary knowledge and background to write anything that approaches the quality and depth of work those two men alone produced. We kow-tow more and more to the mass appeal, which seems to be the order of the day. We have undoubtedly become a civilisation in rapid cultural decline. The established church of this country attempted popular appeal in countering falling congregations by abandoning the old and poetic liturgy that was considered too archaic for modern taste, bowing to the need for instant comprehension and gratification. Those same dictates of taste would treat dear William Shakespeare similarly. \"I can't understand this Shakespeare\" goes up the cry. \"Then we'll remove him\" we respond to our overtaxed little darlings. Take him out of the syllabus, off with his head. That which is of worth and long-standing quality seems now to be denigrated and of no consequence to our time. Our time. A time of instant gratification where chess can be learned in a weekend and one becomes a Segovia on the guitar after a three hour video cassette course. I fear all too strongly that this contagion has reached us in music. The rise of populism serves absolutely no good in the long term. Sugar coated programming of the recording of choice bits of easy listening is a plague and has taken over a once respectable and serious profession to the point where integrity is almost wholly inundated, swamped in parliament parlance. And I'm sick and tired of hearing of those performers who talk of it as their life's work to bring culture and the classics to a wider public as though they are a band of nursing sisters seeking to restore a terminally ill patient. Well, this patient has had a long life and is perfectly capable of continuing to look after him/herself, than you very much. There is more integrity and worth in a few bars of Beethoven Schubert or Mozart than in a hundred lifetimes of a professed do gooder to music. And I don't want Janet Reger ripoff attired Gregorian babes, and the idea of a wet T-shirted quartet where once was the Amadeus has me reaching for the sea sick pills, or even just reaching. Don't get me wrong. Those involved in this branch of music making are entitled to a living doing what they do best - God knows it's hard enough at any time making a career in the arts even for some of the most highly gifted people one meets. When they achieve recognition it's usually hard earned and rightly deserved. These are two very separate and different mediums of entertainment we are dealing with here and vast numbers of the populous are being hoodwinked into believing it's the very best we have to offer. Don't create the impression in the public mind that this is classical performance at its best. Oh no. There are many others for whom those accolades are rightly reserved. What have we become - are becoming - in this money grabbing PR led pursuit of the sale of units. We've become the victims of a gang of well organised hijackers with no musical sensibilities or taste. We aren't alone. Football has its super leagues and millionaire teams at the top end of an inverted pyramid. Not a situation of great equilibrium for the rest of the humbler members of those leagues, I would say. But I did say we are becoming, just now and not just have become. There is an optimism too. It means we have to embrace once and for all, excellence and promote the oft misrepresented of words. Elitism. If it has proved possible for the machinery of hyperbole to promote the modest talents of a schoolgirl chanteuse or a pub tenor into something mind bogglingly out of proportion to reality, and only previously enjoyed and justified by a Jussi Bjorling, a Din Lipatti or a Joan Sutherland, could that same machine not just as easily be directed to our music institutions, and with careful guidance - very important that - thereby allow that same hungry public out there to hear young talent of the highest order needing encouragement more than ever as they embark upon, the rigorous courses that we all hope will make some of them at any rate into artists of real integrity and worth. This country now enjoys a reputation envied throughout the world for the manner in which it can turn out young performers of such consistently high quality. The continuance of that reputation is a matter that should concern us all. Of course it would help were we to be supported - nay, even acknowledged by a sympathetic government, but that seems unlikely to be the case for the foreseeable future, and may never come our way again. We have to find an acceptable way of looking after ourselves outside of a nanny state welfare system - and yet still maintaining the highest standards. Slowly but surely the power and integrity of the raw material with which we work is being undermined. In my own field, I applaud the essays made into the updating of a classic 18th century Mozart opera for example. It is essential we don't remain a music theatre museum. But I don't want us to forget the work's origins at all. The significance of that period. A period of unrest, revolution and reform. It is essential that singers are aware that they have to learn the alphabet before they embark upon war and peace. They have to learn the alphabet before they embark upon War and Peace. They must also become accustomed to they style of costumes, the costumes of the age. Fewer and fewer directors seem unwilling or are able to embrace that subject of historical accuracy. My concern is that it comes from a gap in their own armoury of knowledge that should encompass, for example, everything from the management of hooped skirts and fans to the rules and regulations governing duels. Few have that key to the treasure house that is the classic 18th century. All this is vital background to the young singer in order that we should one day regard them as fully rounded artists and not just another batch of good singers. Without that background they remain promising but ultimately disappointing, in that they will never be able to fulfil the potential that seemed to be there within their grasp at the start. Those very skills of training could so easily be lost to us forever in the space of a generation. That is the sad legacy we would leave and such has never been the case before. We have gifts to hand on - a responsibility. It's a responsibility appreciated and understood by carpenters, bricklayers, goldsmiths, shoemakers, all the characters who inhabit the Meistersingers. The Royal Philharmonic Society has had many important functions in the past, and will shortly recognise several notable musical achievements in the year just gone. It has an enormous part to play now at a time I regard as critical for the continuation of the standards to which we have become accustomed in our music making and listening. We are at a vital road junction. Not a crossroads because that would presuppose a road ahead. I'm saying there is no obvious road ahead at the moment. A new one must be found. Like Pilgrim we must be able to distinguish standing at that junction, which is the road paved with integrity that leads to elitism and excellence, and which is the road to mediocrity - nothing over - just mediocrity. Here we are in a country once jokingly known as 'das land ohne musik', which has been ridding itself of that soubriquet, and acquiring the taste for well over a century now - a long time. We have to hold on to what we have achieved - as difficult and thought provoking as that may be. The amalgamated talents that are in this room tonight could make an enormous difference within our profession. When you go home tonight and have done the homework on Keats and Byron I recommended earlier, the next thing I want you to do is this. Go to the larder and there among all the other tinned goods find a can of worms. And tomorrow morning open it and set them free, to join mine who've been out there for a week now. Let's start to make a big fuss and our voices heard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
