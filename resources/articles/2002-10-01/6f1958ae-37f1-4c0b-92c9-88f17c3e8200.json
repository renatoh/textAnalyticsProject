Let's hope he fulfils his potential because I know how players can look stitched on for greatness at his age and not make it. I worked with three 16-year-olds who I felt were definites to get right to the top. The main one was Norman Whiteside, there was another Manchester United lad called Aidan Murphy and later Lee Hendrie at Aston Villa. Unfortunately Norman's career was cut short by his knee injuries, Aidan never played for United and so far Lee hasn't gone as far as I imagined. It shows how fragile things can be for all sorts of reasons. Rooney has to be nursed carefully and David Moyes doesn't need Everton fans chanting for the kid to come off the bench every time a game isn't going their way. They can't expect him to go in a telephone kiosk, change his uniform and come out and win matches. Once I had given Norman his debut at the end of my first season at Old Trafford only injuries kept him out but I think it was easier for a teenager to bed into that United team than it would be now at Goodison. Without being disrespectful to Everton, we had a more than decent team. We were on top of a lot of matches and that makes a big difference. Norman was also a mature lad. I never thought of him as 16. He was 16 going on 27. He played in the World Cup at 17 and it was obvious that nothing fazed him. I was in Valencia that famous night when Northern Ireland beat Spain and remember seeing Norman crash into Juanito, the Spanish right-winger and idol of the country. He put Juanito into a row just in front of us and the lad almost landed in King Juan Carlos' lap. I thought: \"Norman, hang on a bit, son.\" But that summed him up. By 21 he had played in cup finals, two World Cups and captained Manchester United. It was such a shame about his knee problems because he would have been a legend at Old Trafford. Contrary to what people think, Norman wasn't a party animal as a kid but, if you hear about misdemeanours with young lads, you try to stamp down quickly. The senior pros can always play a big part in helping them settle. Ray Wilkins was good like that at United and it was the same at Villa with Steve Staunton, Kevin Richardson and Ray Houghton. It has been well mooted for a year or more that Rooney has potentially a very big future and all the scouts at United sensed they had a special one in Norman. You can see a player at 15 or 16 and know they have really got something and Norman was in that pot. He came on to the staff at United on a full-time basis as I arrived and the first time I watched him was in the Youth Cup against Sunderland. He had a maturity, aggression and know-how. He played alongside Mark Hughes in that team and Mark was one we thought would make it but were never sure. He was a bit moody and played in bursts whereas Norman looked a dead cert. It was the same at 16 with Murphy, who we felt would be the new Bryan Robson. He was picked for England schoolboys and with United one night he scored four goals from midfield against a strong Nottingham Forest reserve side. He was captain of our team that got to the Youth Cup final and looked destined to go all the way. Aidan was a Manchester lad who used to run to training but he didn't fulfil the promise and moved to Crewe. It wouldn't have surprised me if he'd done a David Platt and made a comeback but it didn't happen. After something like 100 games Murphy briefly went to Scarborough and that was it. As for Hendrie, I knew after 10 minutes he would make it in the Premiership. We invited him to play a friendly to have a look at him and straight away I thought: \"No danger, he's a proper player.\" Lee was about to sign for Birmingham but we snatched him and he was so good as a kid that people like Houghton and Staunton would spend 20 minutes watching him for the youth team on a Saturday morning after we had finished preparing for home games. Lee was a left-sided player then and I still think that's his best position. He has been used as a central midfielder and can do well there but I don't think that does him any favours. Playing in a four on the left he would have solved England's left-side problem by now. As it is, he has got just one England cap. Many expect Wayne Rooney to have far more by his mid-20s but let's not get carried away yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
