Pearson will be defending his Paralympic title for an astonishing third time. He will also be attempting a possible third gold of 2012, which would take his total to 12 golds over four Games. This tally would take him past the 11 golds won by wheelchair athlete Baroness Grey-Thompson. Peerage for Pearson? UNMATCHED SERVICE Equally impressive is Esther Vergeer, the Netherlands' wheelchair tennis champion, for whom defeat is very much a word she does not recognise. Vergeer's amazing record of 465 singles matches unbeaten is unmatched in any sport. SCARY BORIS When the Paralympics ends, one person will surely stand triumphant. Bojo, for it is he, has cemented his position as the nation's favourite buffoon thanks to canny photo opportunies throughout the games, notably an enchanting cameo with Babs Windsor \u2013 so much so that some talk him up as a credible rival to David Cameron. But Boris's popularity is causing consternation in Labour's ranks. Sally Bercow tweeted: \"Really hope Boris doesn't become Tory leader. He's waaay too popular. Labour needs Dave to stay, no?\" NEW BALLS, PLEASE Most necessary rebrand of the Paralympics? Wheelchair rugby. They used to call it murderball. Not the sort of inclusive term the Games organisers like. LESS IS FOUR Poor old Channel 4. The official broadcaster of the Paralympics has been criticised for its advertising breaks and compared unfairly with the publicly funded BBC. And yet the channel won't even turn a profit from the coverage. The broadcaster will recoup only 80% of its outlay. LAST, NOT LEAST After the Olympics gave us Eric \"the Eel\" Moussambani, the Paralympics has crowned its own unlikely hero. Runner Houssein Omar Hassan, left, finished seven minutes behind his rivals after straining his Achilles tendon at the start line of his T46 1500m heat. Hobbling solo for most of his race, Omar Hassan brought the 80,000-strong stadium crowd to a standing ovation as he completed his final lap. \"It was very sore, very sore,\" the man from Djibouti told officials, pointing to his foot. \"I do not stop. I want to finish.\" Which he did, in considerable style. MULTI-TASKER So, now the world knows all about Richard Whitehead, the world record holder for leg amputees in both the marathon and half marathon, who won the 200m, with a blistering performance. He's also got the 100m coming up. But it doesn't stop there. He's also represented his country at swimming, cricket and sledge hockey. The man has more medals than the Pentagon. Incidentally, Whitehead wore his lucky pants for the performance. For the record they are black Calvins. RICH WORDS We are big fans of James Ballardie, Channel 4's Paralympics blogger. Ballardie landed an exclusive with cyclist Jody Cundy following his controversial disqualification, which produced an expletive-filled rant. As Cundy told Ballardie: \"I had no words to describe [it], other than swear words.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
