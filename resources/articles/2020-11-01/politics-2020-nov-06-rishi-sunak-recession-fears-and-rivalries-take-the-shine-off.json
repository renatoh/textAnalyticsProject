At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis the chancellor \u2013 a virtual unknown outside the Westminster bubble just months earlier \u2013 was getting almost as much airtime as the prime minister and collecting a string of flattering nicknames. There was \u201cDishy Rishi\u201d for his \u201cEat out to help out\u201d scheme designed to help restaurants recover from the first national lockdown. The financial news provider Bloomberg also dubbed Sunak, a Star Wars fan, \u201cBritain\u2019s economic Jedi\u201d, for turning on the Treasury\u2019s taps to pay millions of workers\u2019 furlough wages and help save thousands of businesses from collapse. Sunak\u2019s ability to gather such broad support \u2013 the pollsters Ipsos Mori found him to be the most popular chancellor since Labour\u2019s Denis Healey in the 1970s \u2013 was noted by political pundits, who were quick to cast him as the \u201cprime minister-in-waiting\u201d. He remains the bookies\u2019 firm favourite to take the top job. But perhaps Sunak, who turned 40 during the first lockdown and has only been an MP since 2015, let his star rise a little too quickly. His rivals are seeding what they hope will be a more lasting, and damaging, label: \u201cRishi\u2019s recession.\u201d Perhaps this was in the back of his mind when on Thursday he set out the government\u2019s latest spectacular U-turn: extending the furlough scheme to pay up to 80% of a person\u2019s wages up until the end of March 2021. This had not been part of the Sunak master plan, but the chancellor had been under pressure from all sides. Boris Johnson, who installed Sunak in No 11 in February, and his allies are understood to have launched a subtle campaign to ensure Sunak will be associated with the UK\u2019s deepest recession since records began. His name is also being actively linked with some of the government\u2019s most unpopular policies, including the refusal to concede to the footballer Marcus Rashford\u2019s campaign to extend free school meals over half-term. A Sun on Sunday article headlined Rishi vs Rashi accused Sunak of \u201cparking the Treasury bus\u201d to block \u00a320m needed to feed 1.4 million underprivileged children. Allies of Sunak denied the claim and said the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, had not asked for the money. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to take his share of bad news, not just clean up for stuff that works,\u201d one insider said. A minister was said to grumble that Sunak needed to be told to \u201cstop behaving as if he is PM already\u201d. Whether he blocked it or not, the government\u2019s failure to find \u00a320m for hungry children while the chancellor spent half a billion on Eat out to help out has not gone unnoticed at food banks across the country, including those in Sunak\u2019s Richmond constituency in Yorkshire. Alison Grainger, who helps run a food bank in Northallerton, near Sunak\u2019s \u00a31.5m constituency home, said it was \u201cbewildering and disappointing\u201d that Sunak \u201ccould help people rich enough to eat out at restaurants, but not people here who can\u2019t afford to feed their families the basics\u201d. Grainger said she had been impressed by Sunak when he came (along with a publicist and cameraman) to volunteer at the Hambleton Foodshare food bank in the town centre a few years ago. \u201cPeople in the town have been proud of Rishi and what he\u2019s done during the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now I think there is a feeling of disappointment, that he\u2019s trying to do his best for big business but leaving the community to come together to feed the kids.\u201d The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is thought to be working on the assumption it will be Sunak not Johnson he will be fighting at the 2024 general election, and is now zeroing in on the chancellor, blaming him for the economic pain that will be caused by the month-long England-wide lockdown that began this week. Starmer said it was Sunak who blocked the implementation of a less severe two-week \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d recommended by the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) in September. \u201cMake no mistake, the chancellor\u2019s name is all over this,\u201d the Labour leader told company bosses at the Confederation of British Industry virtual conference on Monday. \u201c[It was] his decision to block a circuit breaker \u2013 to dismiss it as a \u2018blunt instrument\u2019.\u201d Sunak, Starmer said, failed to learn, failed to listen and failed to lead. \u201cThe result is tragic \u2013 but all too predictable,\u201d Starmer added. \u201cIt makes me so angry.\u201d Sunak\u2019s previous winter economy plan, which cut the amount of money workers would receive and increase companies\u2019 contributions, did not even make it to the middle of autumn. His mantra that he \u201ccan\u2019t save every job\u201d had changed to say he was acting to \u201chelp protect as many jobs as possible\u201d but only those that were \u201cviable\u201d. The suggestion that the chancellor and his mandarins could decide whose jobs were viable and whose weren\u2019t sparked an immediate backlash, particularly among powerful figures in the arts. Asked by ITV News if he was suggesting some of the UK\u2019s \u201cfabulous musicians and artists and actors\u201d should get another job, Sunak said: \u201cAs in all walks of life, everyone\u2019s having to adapt.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t pretend that everyone can do exactly the same job that they were doing at the beginning of this crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve put a lot of resource into trying to create new opportunities.\u201d This was met with derision \u2013 from stars used to the mud of Glastonbury to those accustomed to the glamour of the Royal Opera House. The British soprano Louise Alder said she couldn\u2019t work in the UK \u201cbecause my industry doesn\u2019t exist\u201d but could in Germany, where audiences are socially distanced. \u201cIn Germany I am \u2018viable\u2019. I choose to stay there,\u201d she said. Oasis\u2019s Liam Gallagher attacked government \u201cdopes\u201d for \u201ctelling musicians and people in arts to retrain and get another job\u201d. The actor Michelle Collins, who played Cindy Beale in Eastenders, said: \u201cThirty-five years an actor, I now have a non-viable job. Thanks Rishi Sunak, is that all of us in the arts? We are prevented from working so cannot even work if we wanted to. Absolutely insulting to me and all those people who thrive in and enjoy the arts. Brings \u00a3120bn into economy.\u201d The chancellor, and his team of special advisers and image consultants running his social media campaign on Instagram and Twitter, are keen to point out that it was hard work and ambition that helped Sunak rise to the top. They talk of his summer job as a waiter at Kuti\u2019s Brasserie Indian restaurant in Southampton, where he grew up, and his admiration for Southampton football legend Matt Le Tissier. Less often mentioned is his time as head boy at \u00a313,000-a-term Winchester college, reading PPE at Oxford University or his years working for Goldman Sachs and controversial City hedge funds. Sunak\u2019s own vast personal wealth \u2013 which includes a \u00a310m-plus property portfolio with homes in Notting Hill and California as well as a Georgian manor house set in 12 acres of grounds in the village of Kirby Sigston, north Yorkshire \u2013 has also caused an unwanted distraction. Around the tearooms in Westminster, MPs are said to speculate that he probably also holds the title of \u201cthe richest man in the House of Commons\u201d. \u201cThere is a sense that his wealth can make him feel a bit detached from other people,\u201d said one Conservative MP who, like Sunak, was first elected to the Commons in 2015. \u201cBeyond his ministerial team, there\u2019s not really anyone I can think of who you\u2019d say is a close ally.\u201d The MP said that Sunak\u2019s ambitions were based on projecting a broad sense of competence, rather than forming a clique. \u201cYou could argue that he has done quite well so far, but giving out all the money is the easy bit. There\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to find out just how rich Sunak is or where his millions are invested as he moved his wealth into a blind trust in July 2019. Labour activists have also seized on Sunak\u2019s wealth and \u201clavish celebrity lifestyle\u201d producing a viral video asking: \u201cIs Dishy Rishi on your side? You decide.\u201d The video, produced by the campaign group One Rule for Them, describes Sunak as \u201cBoris\u2019s smooth-talking people\u2019s politician\u201d and accuses him of planning tax cuts for \u201chis old mates in the City\u201d. As images of Sunak\u2019s Californian beach house, Yorkshire estate and \u201cmansion in Kensington to boot\u201d flash up, the narrator claims the chancellor once worked for a hedge fund that helped crash the economy. Adam McNicholas, founder of One Rule for Them, which describes itself as \u201ca grassroots campaign fighting back against a government who thinks it\u2019s one rule for their lot and another for the rest of us\u201d, said he decided to create the video to \u201cshow the public who Sunak really is\u201d. \u201cNot many people knew he was a hedge fund manager, at a fund that helped crash the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to know that before they make up their minds about him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
