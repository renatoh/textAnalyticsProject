The property entrepreneur, 29, was recently named among the top 10 richest people under 30 in Britain, with a fortune estimated at \u00a369m. If successful, Morris says he will provide a further \u00a325m to bring financial stability to the relegated club. He said: \"Our plans are fully costed and very well financed.\" Leeds went into administration with debts of \u00a335m last Friday following a winding-up order issued by the Inland Revenue, which is owed \u00a35m in unpaid taxes. The business was, with the administrators' approval, almost immediately bought by a new company, Leeds United Football Club Limited, of which Ken Bates is a listed director. But the sale is subject to approval by the club's creditors at a meeting later this month and also by the Football League, while SR Morris and other consortia are aiming to ambush Bates' plans to resume control of the club. Morris was the leading shareholder in the Yorkshire consortium that was in charge at Elland Road for 10 months from March 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
