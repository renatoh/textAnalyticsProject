When Djibril Ciss\u00e9 gave Sunderland the lead it seemed that Newcastle United's owner might require the British Army's assistance to exit the ground safely but, thanks to Shola Ameobi's controversial equalising penalty, Ashley was threatened by nothing worse than resounding boos. His first return to St James' Park since August and the preamble to Kevin Keegan's still lamented departure ended with the Toon Army trooping home with collars raised against the chill winds whipping in from the Steppes in a mood of grim resignation rather than outright rebellion. With no realistic prospect of ousting Ashley averting relegation is the priority and, although Joe Kinnear's stuttering side have now gone eight games without a win, their second Premier League point since Christmas at least brought a measure of relief. It also restored a shred of parochial pride as losing to a not-entirely-convincing Sunderland would have been far too ego-denting to contemplate. Typically, Kinnear took credit for a managerial masterstroke in coaxing Ameobi on to the field despite the striker complaining of an ankle injury. \"I forced Shola to play,\" he said. \"He had a fitness test and said he was still feeling the injury so I told him 'forget it, you're playing'.\" With Shay Given joining Manchester City yesterday \u2013 when Charles N'Zogbia edged closer to joining Wigan in part exchange for Ryan Taylor and a fee \u2013 Steve Harper re-emerged blinking into the limelight after so many years as Given's understudy and performed competently. City have agreed to pay \u00a37m, rising to a possible \u00a38m, for Given, who has been given a 4\u00bd-year contract. Kinnear has already spent much of that money on Kevin Nolan who, after an initially quiet spell, improved considerably, in central midfield. \"Kevin did well,\" said Newcastle's manager. \"I'm very well pleased with the point as we were under-strength.\" Sunderland were marginally the better side but lost momentum after Ciss\u00e9 limped off and Kieran Richardson faded during the second period. \"It's a point gained,\" said their manager, Ricky Sbragia, who is close to completing the signing of Tal Ben Haim from Manchester City. \"The penalty was soft, though.\" Michael Chopra had the chance to impress against his former club but managed only one shot and completed very few passes. His sanguine mood was perhaps understandable considering that Phil Bardsley might have been sent off rather than merely booked for a tackle that wiped out Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez. The Argentinian generally did well but his compatriot Fabricio Coloccini had another shocker and played Ciss\u00e9 just onside after Dean Whitehead lobbed the ball forward. With the rest of the Newcastle defence assuming that Ciss\u00e9 was offside, they stopped in their tracks and watched Harper parry the Frenchman's first shot before being beaten by his follow-up from the rebound. Ashley \u2013 refraining from wearing a replica shirt \u2013 slunk deep in his seat and drew his black-and-white scarf tighter round his neck. Sunderland had come close to scoring when Richardson's curling free-kick struck a post. Although the richochet fell conveniently for Kenwyne Jones, Nolan cleared off the line. Yet Kinnear perhaps belied his yesterday's man image and said something inspirational at half-time as a much improved Newcastle suddenly proved capable of retaining possession for protracted periods. Their confidence seemed boosted when a surge of righteous indignation finally succeeded in uniting Newcastle's fans and management. It arrived as Anton Ferdinand felled Damien Duff in the area, but the referee merely booked the Ireland winger for diving. He was probably correct but arguably had the odd inner doubt because, soon afterwards, he awarded Newcastle the luckiest of penalties in the wake of Steed Malbranque's perceived foul on Steve Taylor. Although contact appeared minimal, the kick was awarded and Ameobi sent Marton Fulop the wrong way from the spot. Sunderland's Danny Collins later said: \"Damien Duff told me Taylor's dive was better than his.\" Aware that a newly swaggering Newcastle no longer had Ciss\u00e9's pace to be petrified of, Sbragia introduced a more subtle weapon in Andy Reid. Anxious to demonstrate why he should have been picked in the first place, Reid quickly unleashed a shot that stretched Harper and, then, with virtually the final kick of the game, directed a half volley tantalising, fractionally, wide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
