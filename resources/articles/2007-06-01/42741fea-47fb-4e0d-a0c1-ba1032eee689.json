The Frenchman has had a knee operation and Manchester United's doctors do not expect him to play again until November at the earliest. Saha has had surgery in the United States after damaging knee cartilage in training in late April. His wretched run of knee, ankle and hamstring injuries has restricted him to four starts this year and Ferguson has been increasingly frustrated by the forward's inability to stay fit. United's manager has already asked his chief executive, David Gill, to explore the possibility of tempting Carlos Tevez away from West Ham, and David Trezeguet is regarded as a back-up option after announcing he will leave Juventus. Internazionale are interested in both players and have made an offer for Tevez. Saha will work with United's medical staff on a rehabilitation programme, the success of which will be key to whether he has a future at Old Trafford. He would like to remain at the club and, ideally, Ferguson would like to keep him, but the manager has serious misgivings about relying on a player so susceptible to injury and there were times last season when it strained their relationship. Saha's advisers have insisted he will be fit to start the season, but Ferguson's information is that the 28-year-old will miss at least the first three months. Sunderland have offered Preston North End \u00a36m for the striker David Nugent. It is not known if the bid will succeed because there is competition from Everton and Portsmouth, and with Nugent abroad with England's Under-21s it is unlikely he will wish to make a decision this week. He has spoken of his boyhood support for Everton but that will be irrelevant if the club do not match Sunderland's offer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
