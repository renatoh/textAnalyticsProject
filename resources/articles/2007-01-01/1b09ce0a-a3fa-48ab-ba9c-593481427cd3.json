Or that - whatever deals he does or doesn't manage to pull off in his City office - Thursday will give him his easiest ride and his happiest moments. Why is he so sure? Because Anthony is one of a growing tribe of long-distance dads in the UK: fathers (and it almost always is fathers) who live apart from their family for all or part of the week because their job is based hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of miles away. So for Anthony, Tuesday is the day when he kisses his wife, Jane, and children, Asmita, Daisy and Arthur, goodbye for three days: and he doesn't like what that means for any of them. \"We've been living this life for the last four and a half years - we left London for Lancashire because we wanted the children to go to school here, and Jane's family were here,\" he says. \"And it's all worked out extremely well - we're very happy here. But I knew from the beginning that, to make the money I need to support them, I needed a metropolitan income: I can work in my company's Leeds office on Mondays and Fridays, but from Tuesday to Thursday I'm in London.\" Leaving Jane and the children behind for half of every week hasn't, Anthony admits, got any easier. \"The truth is that I just miss them all an awful lot. I'm lucky in that I've got a small flat in London. Hotels are soulless for business travellers; I don't think I could do this at all if I had to live in a hotel. But the thing is that you're on your own, it's not home. You phone a lot, and you try to know everything that's going on, but it's hard. And it's hard telling the children why you're doing it as well. Arthur said to me the other day, 'Why do you have to work in London, Daddy? I like it so much better when you're here with us.' It's a tough one to explain.\" For Jane, the days when Anthony is away are always unsettling. \"I think I'm always subconsciously waiting for him to come home - I just can't quite get used to it. I tend to stay up too late doing the ironing and putting things away. It's in the back of my mind that things aren't quite right, that we're not all together.\" The Chitnises have been friends of mine for the past decade; they're one of the closest and most family-oriented couples I've ever known. They're both completely committed to why they're doing what they're doing, and they're both extremely supportive of the other's point of view: what's more, Jane's parents live next door so she has plenty of practical back-up when Anthony is away. But even they are finding long-distance family life tough going, and they're certainly not alone. No one is collating the figures on how many families live apart for some or all of the week, but there are plenty of reasons why it's a reasonable guess that the figure is on the up. Job insecurity, a new kind of employment fluidity, technological change, cheap flights: all this adds up to a world in which it is no longer unthinkable for a thirty- or fortysomething parent to say yes to a job that's many miles from home. Anne Green, a researcher at the Warwick Institute for Employment Research who has studied long-distance commuting and its effect on family life, says that while 20 years ago it would have been unthinkable for a wife and children not to up sticks if a husband got a new job, these days things can be very different. \"Women's employment has changed things: more and more families are dual-career, so one partner getting a new job in another part of the country doesn't necessarily mean the other one's career can automatically be grafted there too,\" she says. \"It's largely a phenomenon of the managerial classes, and of course there are more managerial jobs in the UK now than in the past, which is another reason why it's on the rise. You also find that people in this group tend to value education particularly strongly, and if their children are happily settled in good schools they're often very loth to transfer them to another part of the country.\" These considerations were very much to the fore 10 years ago for the Yardley family when Jonathan, a marketing director, arrived back at the family home in Kingston upon Thames to tell his wife Jean that he'd been offered an exciting new job ... in Germany. \"It was a good career move for him,\" says Jean, now 54. \"But we knew uprooting our four children would be impossible - our older kids were doing their GCSE courses, and their lives were here. We thought it would work: he'd be home every weekend, Germany is only a two-hour flight away.\" And at first, says Jean, it was fine. \"We really trusted one another, which was important. And though the children missed him, we worked hard to make the weekends special. \"But the years went by, and somehow it all went wrong. He started going back to Germany earlier and earlier on a Sunday, and he found it hard to switch from his weekday bachelor existence into this frenetic, four-kids household at weekends. And I started to feel I couldn't share stuff with him because I didn't want to upset him and risk a disastrous couple of days when that was all the time we had.\" Two years ago, Jonathan took a new job in Tokyo, returning only every other month or so. Jean knew it was the beginning of the end, and the couple divorced earlier this year. When she looks back, says Jean, she can see that what undermined their marriage was the loss of opportunities to share the nitty-gritty of life. \"You think it's the big set-pieces, the romantic dinners, that keep you together, but actually it isn't. It's the small stuff: the impromptu giggles, the little nagging worries, the everyday sharing: that's what binds a marriage together, and no amount of emails and phone calls can make up for it. I honestly think if Jonathan had stayed here, though we might have had some tough times, we'd have rocked on together somehow.\" For Laurie Veninger, 44, the alarm bells have already started to sound: her husband, Jim, also 44, currently works in Holland from Monday to Friday, but is giving up his job in the next few months and returning to the UK to a new job in Cambridge. The couple's daughters, 14-year-old Madeleine and 13-year-old Emma, are happy in their school near the family home in Lancashire, but Laurie and Jim have made the difficult decision to uproot them so the four of them can be together again in Cambridge by the end of next year. \"I think Jim taking a job abroad was right at the time, but it's been much harder than we realised it would be to live this way,\" says Laurie. \"It's been three years, and the girls have never got entirely used to it: just today my younger daughter said she was missing her daddy. I'm quite independent - I'm certainly not the sort of wife who needs her husband to kill spiders - but of course there are times when you wish he was around. And the person it's been hardest on, far and away, is Jim himself. The stress on him of all this commuting and of being away from us is visible. I worry about him out there all on his own, and I worry about all the travelling he has to do. \"We exchange lots of emails and we talk on the phone several times a day: he'll usually phone at lunchtime and then again in the evening, and he tries to speak to the girls every day. On the upside we've been together a long time and we're very comfortable about guessing what the other one would say or do in a particular situation, which helps a lot. But the downside is that you don't enjoy one another the way you used to: when he's home there often seems to be just the niggles and the nagging stuff, there's a danger of the little frustrations taking over and not having time to appreciate the good things about one another.\" One of the biggest dangers, says Laurie, is that it's easy to get tough and hardened. \"You haven't got the support for the little things, and you do need that,\" she says. \"I think we've survived it and we'll be OK, but it takes its toll: I'm glad I can see an end to this way of life for us now, and I think things will be a lot easier in the future when we're back together.\" The bottom line is that family life is all about being together: take one key player out of the equation, and you inevitably rock the boat and add to the stresses and strains that every family inevitably experiences anyway. And even though some families can handle it - maybe part of the week like the Chitnises, maybe for a few years like the Veningers - the truth is that, for others like the Yardleys, it can add up to an intolerable strain that ends up with the family splitting permanently. Which is ironic, given that - for most families that take this path - the prime motivating factor in the first place was their children's quality of life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
