BBC Scotland, moving from the leafy, organic olive oil environs of Glasgow's West End for the, shall we say, grittier delights of Govan docks, previously renowned for industrial collapse? Nothing like a bit of schadenfreude, especially when there are chattering classes involved. Imagine conversations over supper: \"They say it's up and coming.\" \"Yes, but...\" \"There's even a supermarket 20 minutes away.\" \"Yes, but...\" \"And the locals are terribly friendly - well, some of them are.\" \"Yes, but where are we going to buy focaccias for lunch?\" Regeneration, innit. That's what I call public service broadcasting! Ups I'll be cackling on the other side of my face - the place is up and coming. It couldn't get much lower, mind. The Clyde's halfway through the biggest docklands revival since London's, though it's a darned sight better. Already there are Imaxes, science centres and concert halls. Coming are 2,500 homes, squares, hotels, digital hub things, riverside walkways, parks, supercasinos and maybe even some bus and light rail connections, plus Zaha Hadid's Transport Museum. Glasgow is still a great property bet: good value, high price rises and the city's revival's still steaming ahead. Downs Expect a decade of cranes and, as in London, a decade of Alphaville before the heart starts pumping. The them and us thing. Getting around The south side's reliant on roads, especially the hideous M8. The north bank has rail from Glasgow Central (four minutes/every 10 minutes). Walk? It's 10 to 30 minutes to the centre. Time out The Armadillo, aka the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, attracts Pavarotti, there's Rangers at Ibrox, but until anything else is built, try a night in with a curry. Schools Primaries such as Kelvinhaugh, Anderston, Lorne St and Copeland seem good. Secondaries such as St Thomas Aquinas and Bellahouston fair but improving; independent Glasgow Academy is popular. Property Pumped-up, mutant apartment towers. Three beds in Lancefield Quay, Festival Park or River Heights around \u00a3350,000; two-beds, \u00a3145,000-\u00a3210,000 (you'll get a lovely Georgian/Victorian two-bedder in the West End for that, but let's not rub salt in the wounds). Phase one of the Glasgow Harbour development for sale; Bryant (0141-334 5518) has the latest apartments, \u00a3170,000-\u00a3305,000. Phase two's better, though not yet for sale. Agents: try Clyde Property Westend (0845 402 7381). Bargain of the week One-bed flat in Lancefield Quay with river views, \u00a3115,000 (Moving, 0845 408 9636)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
