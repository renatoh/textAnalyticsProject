Thomas Haldenwang, head of the BfV, said the number was too great for security services to be able to monitor them all. \u201cWe currently have 12,700 rightwing extremists willing to use violence in Germany, and it\u2019s difficult to have an eye on them all,\u201d he told a press conference at which the first concrete details about the main suspect in the murder of Walter L\u00fcbcke, a member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party, were released. Referred to as Stephan E by investigators, but identified by anti-neo Nazi websites as a relatively well-known far-right figure named Stephan Ernst, the 45-year-old was typical of many rightwing extremists in Germany in that he had kept a low profile, Haldenwang said. For the security services, \u201cpeople who for almost a decade have behaved inconspicuously are not considered a high priority\u201d, he added. Haldenwang said Ernst remained a suspect in L\u00fcbcke\u2019s killing on 2 June, when he was shot outside his home in Kassel. The murder weapon has not been found. DNA found on L\u00fcbcke\u2019s clothing was matched with a DNA sample from Ernst held in a police data bank after he was convicted in 1993 of attempting to detonate a pipe bomb outside an asylum seeker\u2019s shelter in the state of Hesse. As more details emerged about the attack, which has shocked Germany not only because of its brutality but since suspicions were raised that L\u00fcbcke might have been murdered for his pro-refugee stance, the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said investigators were trying to establish whether the attacker was a lone-wolf radical or operated as part of a neo-Nazi terror network. Seehofer called the attack \u201ca rightwing extremist assassination of a leading representative of the state\u201d. He said it was \u201can alarm signal and is directed against all of us\u201d. Haldenwang said Ernst had started engaging in rightwing extremism in the 1980s: \u201cSince this time he has been on the intelligence service\u2019s radar. As a criminal he last came to our attention in 2009. But I can\u2019t exclude whether he might have been conspicuous elsewhere.\u201d The head of Germany\u2019s criminal police department, Holger M\u00fcnch, told the press conference Ernst was a member of a shooting club but did not possess a weapons permit. He is being held in police custody in Hesse, but has so far refused to talk. Ernst is understood to have ties to the militant Combat 18 group, though it remains unclear whether he is a formal member of the international neo-Nazi network, which has a tiered paid membership structure. Combat 18, which was founded as a violent arm of Britain\u2019s BNP in 1992 but has morphed into a network of autonomous neo-Nazi cells across Europe, has an estimated 50 formal members in Germany. According to the German tabloid Bild, Ernst has in the past claimed to be a member of the \u201cOidoxie Streetfighting Crew\u201d, a neo-Nazi group that some have described as a precursor to the current \u201cCombat 18\u201d cell. Authorities emphasised at the press conference on Tuesday that Ernst had dropped off their radar about 10 years ago. The suspect\u2019s name was, however, mentioned in front of the state parliament of Hesse as recently as 2016, when it was raised in a question by the leftwing Die Linke party. In front of a fact-finding committee investigating the activity of the neo-Nazi terror group National Socialist Underground, a police informant had named Ernst as an example of a neo-Nazi in Kassel with violent tendencies. According to the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Ernst had also left a threatening comment underneath a YouTube video in 2018. Using the pseudonym \u201cGame Over\u201d, he wrote: \u201cEither this government abdicates soon or there will be deaths.\u201d More detail has emerged about Ernst\u2019s previous convictions. In 1992 he tried to kill a man at a public toilet at Wiesbaden\u2019s central station who had made \u201csexual advances\u201d, as he claimed in front of a regional court. The victim of the attack, whom the court described as \u201cvisibly foreign\u201d, was stabbed once in the back and once in the front, but survived after several emergency operations. In June 1994, Ernst received a six-year prison sentence for planning the failed pipe-bomb attack on an asylum seekers\u2019 shelter in Hohenstein-Steckenroth in Hesse During pre-trial custody, he also beat up a non-German prisoner with an iron chair leg, according to a report by the newspaper Die Zeit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
