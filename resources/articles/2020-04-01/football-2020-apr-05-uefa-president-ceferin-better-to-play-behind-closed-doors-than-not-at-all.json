European football\u2019s club competitions are indefinitely postponed, with the finals of both competitions called off and no new dates allocated due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, Uefa remains intent on finishing the Champions League and Europa League seasons and has warned that any domestic leagues which are abandoned prematurely could result in teams being excluded from its competitions in the future. \u201cThe fact is that we really don\u2019t know much,\u201d Ceferin told the German broadcaster ZDF. \u201cWe are waiting for the development of this terrible situation in the world, and mainly in Europe. Football isn\u2019t the same without fans \u2026 it is definitely better to play with fans than without fans. \u201cIt is still better to play the game behind closed doors and have it on TV, which is what the people need and want because it brings positive energy to their homes, than not playing at all. That\u2019s what the people want, that brings positive energy, and it will be July or August. We can\u2019t play it out in September or October.\u201d Pushed on whether the season could be abandoned totally, Ceferin said: \u201cIf the authorities do not allow us to play, then we cannot play.\u201d Uefa was forced to issue a statement on Sunday denying reported comments from Ceferin that the Champions League had to finish by 3 August. \u201cThis is not true,\u201d said the statement. \u201cThe president was very clear not to set exact dates for the end of the season. Uefa is currently analysing all options to complete domestic and European seasons with the European Club Association and the European Leagues in the working group set up on 17 March. The primary priority of all the members of the working group is to preserve public health. \u201cFollowing on from that, it is to find calendar solutions to complete all competitions. Options are currently being studied to play matches in July and in August if needed, depending on restart dates and the permission of national authorities.\u201d Ceferin also admitted that Uefa is considering postponing its Financial Fair Play regulations for at least a season given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, although it is understood that Manchester City\u2019s appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over their two-year ban could still be conducted via conference call in May or June. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of the possibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be flexible because the clubs are in deep financial problems. They cannot perform the FFP now. For now, we are postponing it to see how the season goes, but we can decide either way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
