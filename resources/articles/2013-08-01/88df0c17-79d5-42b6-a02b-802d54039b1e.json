They are both fine-tuned virtuosi whose projects sound like edgy classical chamber-music as much as improv or jazz, and that impression is all the stronger here. The sense of romantic melancholy turning to scurrying vivacity on Five Senses of Keen is also there in Orpheus and Eurydice, with its elegant folk melody for piano underpinned by a spinning violin pattern. Later stages of the set tend toward more exclamatory, improv-like figures in both the themes and the variations. But even at their most heated, Courvoisier and Feldman always sound as if they're weighing proportions, massaging nuances, and drawing listeners in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
