For the second game running Derby were on the wrong end of an official howler, and chances are they will be relegated as a result. Replays showed that Manel was onside when he slid the ball past West Ham's debutant goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek in injury-time on Saturday, but the linesman's flag ensured the Rams left with just a point when it should have been three. George Burley, one of those managers who rarely whinges, understandably found it hard to be his usual philosophical self. \"Diabolical decisions have cost us five points from the last two matches, and that's hard to take in our position,\" said the Scot, grimly. \"We've improved over the last couple of months, given ourselves half a chance, so it's ...disappointing. We can do it but we'll probably have to win all our home games and pick up something away.\" It is as unlikely a prospect as West Ham hitting the 75-point mark that their manager Alan Pardew believes will be necessary to reach the play-offs. After a reasonably bright start Pardew's team quickly ran out of ideas, and as the crowd grew restless, almost as quickly lost their nerve. In the second half they were for the most part abject, and a team with more confidence than Derby would have taken them apart. The final whistle was greeted with a chorus of \"What a load of rubbish\" from all sides of the famous ground on which players such as Thomas Repka simply do not belong. One fan who told the hapless Czech as much after he had contrived, in rapid succession, to land three throw-ins at the feet of Derby players, got several mouthfuls in return. It was remarkable to hear Pardew heap much of the blame on the pitch, which while not perfect is a lot better than any on nearby Hackney Marshes. Citing the loss of Matthew Etherington to injury was more legitimate, the young winger having been West Ham's most creative player this season, but the fact is, coming on the back of similarly appalling efforts at Millwall and Reading, the Hammers are starting to blow their promotion chances big time. \"We realise the task is difficult now, but a win could be all it takes to get us back on track,\" said Pardew. \"Everyone, players, management and fans, is getting frustrated and it's hard to keep that at bay.\" When his players show so little stomach for the fight, it is hard to sympathise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
