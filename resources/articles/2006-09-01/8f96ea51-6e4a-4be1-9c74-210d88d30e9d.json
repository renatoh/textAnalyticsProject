Having completed the shock signings of Carlos T\u00e9vez and Javier Mascherano, Upton Park has been awash with optimism but the West Ham manager adopted a strangely pessimistic outlook prior to tonight's home leg against the Italians. \"There's going to be respectability in losing to them,\" Pardew said. \"I sent Keith Peacock and Roger Cross to Palermo on Sunday [to watch them beat Reggina 4-3] and their report came back saying if they play like they did in the first half, don't even bother turning up. I know they're a very good Serie A team and my tip to be the outside challenge for a Champions League place. We'll be up against it.\" Contemplating a fixture pile-up should West Ham progress, Pardew again did little to fill his charges with confidence. \"I don't have to worry about [fixture congestion] unless we get through,\" he said. \"It's two games and that won't hurt us, but it'll be different once we get into the group stages and have to make sure people are fit for the league and the Uefa Cup game. But my only concern for this game is the unusually short turnaround for [the game against] Newcastle on Sunday.\" The Blackburn manager, Mark Hughes, is demanding his players do not waste last season's hard work by failing to qualify for the Uefa Cup group stages. \"We want to make the adventure last as long as possible,\" said Hughes, whose side face Salzburg in Austria tonight. \"We've worked extremely hard to get into the competition and now we are looking to make the most of it. We want more than just two games in Europe after all the effort we put in last year.\" Hughes was told yesterday that his centre-back Ryan Nelsen is out until Christmas following a hamstring operation. The Hearts manager, Valdas Ivanauskas has urged his players to keep their cool for tonight's visit of Sparta Prague to Murrayfield. Roman Bednar became the sixth Hearts player to be sent off this season on Saturday and Ivanauskas warned: \"I need to remind the players again; if you stay on the pitch, you stay in the game and you can keep fighting.\" Thomas Buffel wants Rangers to repeat their Champions League feats of last season, when they reached the last 16, in the Uefa Cup. Rangers are away to Molde tonight. \"We are hoping to do the same this season in the Uefa Cup,\" said Buffel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
