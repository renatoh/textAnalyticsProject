The answer is that Americans bought roughly 44 million PCs last year, according to Gartner Dataquest figures, compared with 13 million DVD players, according to the excellent table from the Consumer Electronics Association. I don't think anyone who has read the press for the past year would have had the impression that expensive and complicated PCs were outselling cheap and simple DVD players by better than 3 to 1. Indeed, it would be interesting to know if more DVD players were sold inside PCs than separately -- it's certainly possible from the numbers. But don't get too bound up with the astonishing success of the PC market. Sales were down from 49 million last year, and the Intel/Microsoft hegemony won't be able to keep coming up with reasons for people to buy new machines every few years forever,"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
