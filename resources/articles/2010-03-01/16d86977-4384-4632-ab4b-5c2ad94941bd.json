Fortunately, plenty happened before hand, including Final Fantasy XIII, great game quotes and how to become a meat-up regular. That sounds wrong, doesn't it? Final Fantasy XIII \u2013 tempted? On Monday morning, a beautiful weekend had just passed \u2013 clear blue skies and lovely bright sunshine. Such a shame that FFXIII didn't arrive on most people's doormats (myself included \u2013 hrumph), which meant we couldn't spend the whole sunny 48hr period indoors, in the dark, sat in our underpants, crouched over a controller. Or would that just have been me? [Regretably, I'm thinking, no - Keef] Tuesday (release day) spawned a few early blogger reviews of FFXIII for those of us lucky enough to get it a day early (w00t!). Plus points seem to be the shiny visuals, impressive cut scenes, frenetic battle system (when you eventually get it). Negative points are the very slow pace (20 hours of linearity for a start) and typical angsty-teen and fluffy-girlie characters. It seems like this one needs time to settle in, but has already done a good job in dividing the blog. Heavy Spoilers (again) Despite Heavy Rain only being out for just over a week, many people had already completed it and the blog was resplendent once again with posts headed 'HEAVY RAIN SPOILERS'. This was frustrating to say the least for those waiting for the Qauntic Dreams masterpiece to hit the bargain bins, and it all got too much for Bigworv \u2013 \"Can you go and talk about Heavy Rain somewhere else. One of you f****rs will forget spoilers and ruin it for me.\" Bargain Spotters In between talk of Modern Warfare 2, football and mugs, PhilosopherK1ng managed to find a great bargain on Valkyria Chronicles \u2013 only \u00a319.95 from ShopTo! Chubster2010 later spotted another bargain buy \u2013 Chinatown Wars on PSP for \u00a34.99 from play.com. Sadly this one was quickly whacked back up to \u00a324.99, but a couple of people did get their orders sent out at \u00a34.99. Good bargain spotting fellas \u2013 keep it up! What a bunch of mugs\u2026 On Wednesday morning Be4ch expressed a desire to have his own Gamesblog mug, as his company now requires people to bring their own mugs to work for\u2026 you know\u2026 'green' reasons. He even mocked up several and has linked them to a Wiki page that he also set up. What a legend! He clearly has too much time on his hands (as do the rest of us I guess, else we wouldn't be on the blog all day). Great London Pubs and Worst Places to Live See Wednesday's box for a full list of the best London pubs. As for the worst places to live, honourable mentions go to Feltham, Canary Wharf, St Mary's (Southampton), Hull and Stockport. Apparently PipSickness once found a dead lady on his bonnet when he lived in St Mary's, which led us all to wonder whether he is in fact the famous Southampton Ripper. Favourite game quotes On Wednesday we got to discussing the best gaming quotes of all time, including such beauts as \"You were nearly a Jill sandwich!\" from Resident Evil (actually, it was \"almost, a Jill sandwich\" - Keef), the synthesized voice that said \"Good luck!\" as you exited the tunnel in Starwing, the garbled voice that says \"Treasure Island Dizzy!\" in the game with the same name and the all-time classics \"Rise from your grave!\" and \"Welcome to your doom!\" from Altered Beast. (I would add \"Another visitor, stay a while, stay FOREVER\", \"Welcome to the stage of history\" and \"Game over, yeah!\" though the latter is technically a song lyric - Keef) Get bitten by the bug\u2026or dog On Thursday our resident abstainer timthemonkey regaled us with his story of the night prior: \"Gaming \u2013 None, as I went for a nice jog in the evening sunshine in an effort to get slighter fitter before Cricket season starts. This, however, turned out to be a poor plan as it lead to me getting savagely bitten by a dog on the back of the calf. 12 stitches and a three hour wait in A&amp;E and the fitness kick had lost its appeal. Looked at it this morning and the surrounding area has gone a wonderful shade of purple as well. Feet up tonight!\" Cue jokes over purple, swollen limbs. There was of course plenty of advice on how to sue the owner. Or take revenge on the dog. Let's meat up\u2026 On Thursday morning, as people trickled onto the blog, there were some confessions of feeling rather ropey after the previous night's blog meat up. Somebody chundered but nobody seemed to want to 'fess up to it. Worryingly, these nights seem to be becoming a regular occurrence. What have I done?! If you want to join up to one of the London-based blog meat ups \u2013 generally a night to sit, drink and chat games (and war dollies if you want) \u2013 speak to resident organiser CunningStunt. Friday Ranting \u2013 adverts The usual Friday vitriol was reserved for the terrible adverts we see on TV nowadays. Here are some examples: \"Moonpig. Think it's the only way I can get a card to my mother before Sunday. However, their constant looping of the same annoying advert for years has built up my lava pit of hatred for them.\" SuperSmashIn voices his wrath at the personalised greetings card industry \"Adverts. Go compare, We buy any car/gold, Moonpig - take a back seat. Has anyone seen the new Dove for men advert? Good. F*****g. Lord.\" Uncle3en lets loose \"I've always reserved a special hatred for the poorly dubbed Glade adverts. If your products that good, why haven't you shelled out the money for decent advertising instead of getting the receptionist to speak over the smug German woman?\" Timthemonkey goes ape (see what I did there\u2026?) \"Those Ray Winstone Radio Adverts for Volkswagen Veeeeaaaaans. '20 poun' a mumf' 'Vowkswagin Transpowtah.' Get out.\" KayJayM quotes an advert I've never seen, but sounds very annoying. This went on for some time and eventually evolved into hatred of Sunday morning show 'Something for the Weekend'. The language was such that it cannot be repeated here. (Thank goodness, my delete finger is getting tired - keef) Quotes of the week \"Cashback - Went to the cashpoint at lunchtime and got out twenty quid, and it gave me four fivers! Incredible scenes. Had to check I wasn't in 1987 by mistake.\" An exciting afternoon for Limni. \"@Whoever mentioned it was Chuck Norris' Birthday. He shares his birthday with Osama Bin Laden. Coincidence or something more sinister...?\" Robotron2000 goes all 'conspiracy theory' on us. \"Has Cunning died? Or is he still going up and down the Northern Line?\" Henrypootle's worried concern after Wednesday night's meat up. Also discussed Games: Battlefield Bad Company 2, Heavy Rain, Final Fantasy XIII, Films &amp; TV: Avatar, Hurt Locker, District 9 Welcome to: Albatri, CobraOB"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
