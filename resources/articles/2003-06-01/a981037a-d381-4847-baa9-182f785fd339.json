In the case of ultra-directional wallpaper designers Deborah Bowness and Rachel Kelly - who studied at Leeds University together - they suggest you ditch all preconceptions of wallpaper as a static roll of pretty-pretty repeat patterns and view it afresh as a giant canvas to customise freely. Bowness is showing an installation of her wallpapers at a show called Living Rooms, at north London's Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture (MoDA), part of Middlesex University. She has pasted an entire corridor with photographic, life-size images of no-frills interiors snapped on her recent travels in the Far East - from the banana-leaf-lined walls of a guest-house in Thailand to a birdcage-festooned Hong Kong street. Sepia-toned, these are dreamlike and nostalgic without being neo-colonial or twee. A far cry from Laura Ashley sprigs, they feature mundane, grungy touches, from institutional-looking phones to 'dodgy wiring'. 'Some rooms look like tropical prisons,' she says. Bowness also sells kits of cut-out motifs and 3D accessories you can stick on: 'Birdcages' (birds and cages); 'Ruddy ducks' (archetypal flying ducks grouped into large, unruly flocks), and 'Paper plates' (50s plates with real plate hooks). Living Rooms is a continuation of experiments initiated while she was studying printed textiles at the Royal College of Art. Her degree show featured Hooks and Frocks - a boudoir-chic wallpaper picturing tea dresses casually hung on a bedroom wall - which won the Oxo/Peugeot Design Awards textiles category prize in 2000. Its 3D elements - real hooks and hangers - saved it from being overly saccharine. 'I wanted to create something functional, not just conventionally decorative,' she explains. Kelly did an MA in textiles at Central Saint Martins. While there, she let loose some fellow students on a crackpot idea - a board and stickers - to see what they'd make of it. 'They went mad. I realised this was the way forward.' She decided against taking the normal route of the textiles graduate - 'working for one of the big textile firms churning out designs you don't like'. Inspired by the landmark 90s ICA show Stealing Beauty - which showcased a new trend for lo-fi, DIY design as an antidote to the coldly slick loft look - she created her wallpaper stickers inspired by herbaceous borders and suburban-kitsch doilies in high-gloss vinyl, in luscious emerald green, lipstick red and blackcurrant-fool pink. These can be put on to any surface - doors, chests of drawers, chairs. She plans to produce an interactive tablecloth, too - rectangles and circles of coated silk printed with trompe l'oeil 'shadows' that look like they've been cast by vases of flowers. 'I'd include stickers of petals you could stick on to the shadows as if they'd dropped on to them.' Her latest wallpaper, commissioned by Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur, is inspired by Sex and the City, and features renditions of ultra-retro Gucci and Dolce &amp; Gabbana kitten heels in cafe-au-lait shades, reminiscent of Andy Warhol's elegant 50s shoe illustrations. Its interactive element? Labels to stick on the inside of the shoes which you can write your name on to personalise the paper. Kelly and Bowness's designs aren't totally iconoclastic. According to Lesley Hoskins, the curator of Bowness's show, 'Deborah's large-scale images recall the early 19th-century tradition of \"scenics\" - papers picturing panoramic tropical landscapes, paradise gardens or trompe l'oeils of drapes and swags imitating ritzy curtains. In Kelly's stickers there are echoes of a 30s fad called \"drops and growths\" - a border fringed with hanging plants like wisteria pasted near the ceiling and another with vertically growing lupins and delphiniums near the skirting board.' But the new wallpaper vogue is taking things further by being fully interactive. \u00b7 Living Rooms is at MoDA, Middlesex University, Cat Hill, Barnet (020 8411 5244) until September (Cockfosters is the nearest tube station).
