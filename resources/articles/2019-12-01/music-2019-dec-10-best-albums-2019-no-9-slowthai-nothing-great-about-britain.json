Staring down the barrel of another period of austerity, only a working-class artist could create the state-of-the-nation treatise needed to make sense of it. Enter Slowthai, who pilfers from rap, punk and garage to depict every shade of a wretched nation. Fittingly, throughout his debut album, the 24-year-old rapper plays the Shakespearean fool. In the Bard\u2019s plays, the fool was a savvy servant who danced circles around those of a higher social standing. They were the one to provide wit in bleak times, and so in Nothing Great About Britain, Slowthai wryly evokes the forgotten parts of the country through snapshots of working-class life: tea and biscuits, hiding drugs, fallouts with a stepfather, EastEnders\u2019 Phil Mitchell. From the album\u2019s eponymous opening track to the so-quick-you\u2019ll-miss-them barbs at the prime minister (\u201cI run my town, but nothing like Boris!\u201d), his punk spirit ridicules the country\u2019s gatekeepers. The album art visualises Slowthai\u2019s intent in a striking tableau: people watch from an estate and union jacks limp over the balconies, as a naked Slowthai grins like a maniac, locked in medieval stocks. The self-proclaimed King of Northampton suffers with a smile. Despite Slowthai\u2019s various statements over his breakout year \u2013 brandishing a mock-up of Johnson\u2019s decapitated head at the Mercury awards, his \u201cFuck Boris\u201d T-shirts, his delicious comments about Theresa May \u2013 his debut isn\u2019t explicitly political. Slowthai shows, not tells, and Nothing Great About Britain lets the personal speak for itself. In his case, that\u2019s growing up to a half-Bajan single mother in a deprived area and dealing with a cheating stepfather. On Ladies, he pays tribute to the fairer sex: the ones who have the babies, drive men crazy but made them what they are. He\u2019s happiest \u201cdreaming of a life he\u2019s not living\u201d, everything any nice aspirational lad would be after. (\u201cI want a wife that\u2019s gracious / Then we can get a yard that\u2019s big in Barbados.\u201d) And still the phrase repeats itself across the album like a darkly comic mantra: there\u2019s nothing great about Britain! Except Slowthai clearly thinks there is given how he applies such tenderness and care to the characters that populate his world. \u201cKicked us out now we living at Tasha\u2019s,\u201d he raps on Northampton\u2019s Child: \u201cIn her living room / Funny how good vibes turn the room to a palace.\u201d In a savvy piece of marketing, Slowthai\u2019s team set up mirrors around cities with the caption \u201csomething great about Britain\u201d. His \u201cBet Ya a \u00a35er\u201d tour billed tickets at five pounds in a bid to attract fans who wouldn\u2019t usually be able to afford an academy gig. For all Slowthai\u2019s apparent nihilism, his message is uplifting: it\u2019s the people who make our country something worth saving. In Shakespeare\u2019s time, the fool highlighted key cultural truths: war, corrupt leaders, personal suffering. By playing the jester, Slowthai became the voice of a British generation at the turn of a turbulent decade. Hope may feel unfeasible for twentysomethings on the eve of another general election, but there\u2019s some comfort, at least, in grim humour. We\u2019ve got to keep laughing or we\u2019d die crying."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
