Quite how, is anybody's guess. A few days ago, the plans were unformed. That is to say, there weren't any. Not the sort of plans that the British military would recognise as, well, plans. I suspect the Brits were just itching to seize control - pin up maps, draw up timetables and generally restore order in the chaos. But that wouldn't be transition. So they did what they had to do, and didn't do anything, until they were asked. They watched the Afghans juggle the plates - and the Afghans pulled it off on the day. Somehow. Perhaps that's what the transition process will look like writ large - complete mayhem, verging on out of control, but OK in the end. Somehow. That would probably suit everyone. Back at the British base in Lashkar Gah, tent etiquette is a cause for concern. Last night, nobody seemed to want to turn the lights off. So far, they have gone out at 9ish - I thought it was automatic. Last night they were still on at 11pm, even though all 32 of us were in our bunks. That's 30 battle-hardened soldiers with guns, and two middle-aged journalists - me and the guy from the Independent. Well, neither of us were going to ask if it was time for bed. Luckily, an American Marine spared our blushes and found the switch. I suspect nobody else knew where it was and nobody wanted to ask."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
