Webb missed last year's victory over St Helens at Old Trafford with a back injury that also ruled him out of the World Cup, and although the Rhinos' coach, Brian McClennan, insists that he will play in the rematch, he was suspiciously evasive about the nature of the problem that forced Webb off in the second half of Friday's victory against the Catalans Dragons. \"He's just injured,\" said McClennan, who has been reluctant to answer questions about the injuries Webb has suffered with worrying regularity all season. \"It's not a major concern. He'll most definitely end up in the 17.\" McClennan denied that Webb's surprise omission from the 23-man squad New Zealand named yesterday for the Four Nations series later this autumn was related to his fitness. With Warrington's second row Louis Anderson also left out by the Kiwis' coach, Stephen Kearney, the Wigan scrum-half Thomas Leuluai is the only British-based player included. Keiron Cunningham, the St Helens captain who, like Webb, was cleared by the Rugby Football League's video review panel yesterday after being put on report in the semi-finals, failed to attend the pre-grand final press conference at Old Trafford because he was having a scan on a hand problem which has been described as both a broken bone and ligament damage. The Saints coach, Mick Potter, dismissed any suggestion that the hooker might be denied a seventh grand final appearance. \"He'll play, no matter what,\" said Potter. \"He'll be offered medical advice but I don't think anyone will tell Keiron he's not playing in a grand final, regardless of the outcome of the scan.\" Ali Lauitiiti's return from illness for Leeds is therefore likely to be the only change from the teams that took Saints and the Rhinos to their third consecutive grand final meeting. Any doubt that Wigan will tomorrow unveil Michael Maguire as their new coach following the decision not to renew Brian Noble's contract was removed today when the Melbourne Storm coach, Craig Bellamy, admitted that he expects to lose his assistant. \"I think Michael will certainly go if he gets a visa,\" Bellamy said. \"He has done a great job for us. He is very talented and he thinks he is ready for a head coach's job and I think he is too. That is what he wants to do and he'll certainly get the blessing from our club, without a doubt.\" Wigan's 20-year-old stand-off Sam Tomkins was named as the Super League's young player of the year ahead of Warrington's Richie Myler and Kyle Eastmond of St Helens at last night's Engage Man of Steel ceremony in Manchester. Huddersfield's Australian full-back, Brett Hodgson, collected the headline award which is now voted on by the Super League players, beating off competition from the England props Adrian Morley and James Graham. The Giants picked up a second major award as Nathan Brown was named coach of the year. That award was decided before the club's best-ever Super League finish, in third, was followed by two defeats in the play-offs.
