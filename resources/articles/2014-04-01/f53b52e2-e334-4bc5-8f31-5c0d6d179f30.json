But the first national primary school offer day, when every four-year-old in England learned which primary they would go to, will have been a tense affair for all 600,000 children due to start school this autumn. Many primaries were too oversubscribed to take all the children whose families had made them first choice. But against predictions, local councils under the most pressure \u2013 especially those in London \u2013 managed to maintain the proportion of children getting into the school parents put top of their list. It still means around a fifth of families missed out. The parenting website Netmums reports that the de facto school starting age is now two, as it becomes accepted that parents put their children into nurseries linked to the primary they hope to go to. And the real pressure of the new baby boom is still to come. One survey by the Local Government Association showed that some areas \u2013 a part of Norfolk, central Croydon, Thurrock in Essex \u2013 need to expand the number of primary places next year by 75% to keep up with demand. Many more, particularly in London, but also in Bristol and Manchester, will have to grow by at least a fifth. Within three years, another 130,000 primary places \u2013 more than 4,000 classes \u2013 are needed in addition to the 90,000 created last year. The government's \u00a35bn extra funding has done the trick for most families this year. But on the ground councils have to wrestle, not only with several different income streams, but also with the fragmentation of the local system. Free schools and academies are outside council control and can't be asked to expand. Councils are right to argue they should control school-place planning. It is an absurdity that they are legally required to provide a place for every child that needs one without having the power to make it happen. They also want to be able to work across school areas to produce rational, value-for-money provision. They want free schools built only where there is a shortage of places, and they want them to have to meet the same cost-benefit criteria as maintained schools. And they want a single stream of cash available to build new schools, and to rebuild and maintain existing ones, including free schools and academies. It may be that the biggest primary school myth is the idea that has motivated a generation of school reform \u2013 that market-based accountability is the best driver of standards. Parents of four-year-olds do not have the luxury of time. They cannot wait for the market to respond to a shortage of quality education they want. They need it now. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 April 2014.
