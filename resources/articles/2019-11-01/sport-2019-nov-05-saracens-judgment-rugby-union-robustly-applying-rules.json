The first was that for all Saracens\u2019 protests and self-justifying explanations \u2013 and rugby union\u2019s historic wobbliness about enforcing its salary cap \u2013 this is a spectacle of a sport robustly applying its rules, regardless of a club\u2019s power and pedigree. Saracens provided eight players for England\u2019s World Cup squad led by the captain Owen Farrell, and those weary warriors were barely home from the airport when this blow landed. The second was that clever ways of paying players very often turn out to be not as well-advised as they must seem when conceived. Premiership Rugby\u2019s rules do not require full reports of disciplinary panels to be published; its summary merely said Saracens had \u201cfailed to disclose payments to players\u201d and \u201cexceeded the ceiling for payments to senior players\u201d in the past two seasons when they finished champions, and in 2016-17. It was Saracens who confirmed at the heart of the charge was their owner Nigel Wray\u2019s practice of \u201cco-investing\u201d in businesses with the club\u2019s players and that the disciplinary panel had found against the club\u2019s argument that such \u201cco-investments\u201d should be seen sympathetically as part of its commitment to players\u2019 welfare, not included in something as basic as the total money they were being paid. In March, Wray went public with a long plea for these business partnerships to be considered acceptable, after they had first drawn attention and the indignation of other clubs. \u201cFirst and foremost I am an advocate of entrepreneurialism and independent spirit,\u201d he said, presenting the co-investments as part of Saracens \u201creally caring for people\u201d and providing for players\u2019 education, welfare and post-career planning. \u201cHow do you look out for your family?\u201d he asked, rhetorically. Along with educational opportunities and business secondments, Wray listed the dizzying support or investment provided to senior players\u2019 businesses including captain Brad Barritt\u2019s Tiki Tonga coffee company; Chris Wyles\u2019s and Al Hargreaves\u2019s Wolfpack Lager; a table business, gin company, a cocktail venture founded by Mike Ellery and Tim Streather, and \u201cSanderson\u2019s Puddings, run by Alex Sanderson\u2019s mum\u201d. Not included in that long statement, however, were Wray\u2019s investments in companies with Farrell, Richard Wigglesworth and Billy and Mako Vunipola. Faz Investments, which Farrell and Wray own jointly, was stated last month to be dormant, but Vunprop, owned by Wray equally with the Vunipola brothers, has an investment property valued in the most recently published accounts at \u00a31.54m. Wiggy9, of which Wigglesworth is the sole director and Wray a 30% shareholder, owns a property valued at \u00a3875,000 in Lewisham, south-east London. In its response to the panel\u2019s findings the club said it \u201csteadfastly maintains that player co-investments do not constitute salary\u201d and promised it will \u201ccontinue to vigorously defend this position\u201d. Premiership Rugby pointed out that the salary cap was introduced 20 years ago \u2013 by agreement of the clubs \u2013 to try to maintain clubs\u2019 financial sustainability in a professionalised sport with inevitably escalating players\u2019 wages and to keep the league competitive between the richer and less well off. The regulations clearly plan for the possibility that players might not receive all their money in a monthly standing order with PAYE deducted. \u201cSalary\u201d is defined very widely as \u201cany salary, wage, fee, remuneration, compensation, match fee, per diem, royalty, gratuity, profit, perquisite, reward, emolument, earnings, incentive, retainer, loyalty payment, preferred payment or any other sum\u201d. The panel constituted by the dispute-determining organisation Sports Resolutions and chaired by Lord Dyson, a former president of the court of appeal, appears to have decided that Wray\u2019s and Saracens\u2019 many investments in players\u2019 businesses did indeed count in that catch-all of pay the cap seeks to limit. The enormous, season-wrecking points penalty is set in the rules for a breach of over \u00a3650,000 in any salary cap year. The financial penalty is \u00a33 for every \u00a31 over the \u00a3350,000 permitted, suggesting that Saracens were paying their players \u00a31.78m above it. Saracens have pledged to appeal, which according to the rules must be to another panel constituted by Sports Resolutions. There they will argue that the salary cap itself should be judged anti-competitive and invalid and that Lord Dyson got the law wrong. That appears to present something of a challenge \u2013 as will getting these tangled affairs into order, and dealing with a 35-point penalty if, as must be expected, this thumping judgment stands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
