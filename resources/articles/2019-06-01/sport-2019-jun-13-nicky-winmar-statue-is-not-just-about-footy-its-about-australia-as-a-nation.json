Little did he, or anyone else know, that with that simple action he was changing the way Australians would talk about race relations for years to come. So powerful was the image that we are still talking about it today. Since then the image has become so embedded into our consciousness there have been songs written about it, a book and countless reproductions from cartoons to graffiti. It\u2019s the power of the action and the image and what Winmar was saying that have now seen a statue created and erected on the banks of the Derbarl Yerrigan, the Swan river, in Perth. This is significant for several reasons. For me personally, Nicky and I share a heritage. We are both Noongar men. Noongars have for many years made up about a third of all playing stocks in the elite AFL. Polly Farmer, the Krakouers, Sonny Walters, Leon Davis, Michael Johnson, the Materas, Lewis Jetta, Derek and Dale Kickett are all Noongars. Nicky holds a special place in this continuum as he was the first Indigenous player, Noongar or otherwise, to play 200 AFL games. Pretty deadly for a boy from the Pingelly Reserve in WA, where he learnt how to mark by bouncing off an old bench seat from an EK Holden. Another significant reason is Winmar\u2019s statue will be the first to take pride of place at the city\u2019s new Optus Stadium and says as much for Winmar\u2019s skill as it does about his heritage. The reason for this is for many blackfellas the connection to country is as strong as family. It\u2019s how we identify. For Nicky\u2019s statue to take pride of place in the Noongar heartland and next to the ground where a game that is sacred to many Australians, both black and white, means a great deal. Many have been critical of this feeling that the statue should have been placed in a variety of other sites, Moorabbin Oval where he played for the Saints, Victoria Park \u2013 the Collingwood stronghold where he, along with Gilbert McAdam, were abused on that day. Some have even suggested it should be out the front of AFL House. But the fact is Perth is the right choice. Because just as the photograph has transcended the realm in which it was taken so too has the statue transcended state borders and tribal footy affiliations. It\u2019s a statue for all Australians, whether you like footy or not. My biggest hope for Winmar\u2019s statue is that as people stream into Optus Oval to watch the footy or attend a concert they take the time to stop and reflect not just on Winmar and his achievements but ask themselves what they know about Australia\u2019s First Nations people. Not what they think they know but what actual information has inspired, angered or saddened them about Australia\u2019s black history. In this way Winmar\u2019s statue is not just about footy. It\u2019s about us as a nation. It\u2019s about what makes us tick as Australians. What are our common ideals and goals and what are our challenges. I hope children stop their parents and ask them about the statue and who Winmar was and where he came from, geographically, historically and politically. Maybe when this happens, and the conversation is generated where we can answer honestly and without shame we can really start to measure how far we have come by the quality of the conversation we have with one another and ourselves. Winmar changed the conversation about racism in Australia. The power of the moment captured by Wayne Ludbey is arguably the most famous football photo in Australian history. The power comes from the composure of Winmar in the face of adversity, the artistic balance of the photograph as a significant historical moment and the fact it has transcended the sporting realm. The reason why we still talk about what Winmar did is because it cannot be easily explained. It is about race, racism, sport and identity. What many can seem to agree on is that what Winmar was saying was fundamental: I am black and I am proud. The statue is the latest example in the ongoing discussion that Winmar has enabled and told through the lens of football. It helps us understand who we are and where we have come from. The statue of Winmar situated at Optus Stadium is significant due to the deep connection that Winmar has to his Noongar identity. That the statue is in Perth and at Optus Stadium is great acknowledgment of Winmar\u2019s Aboriginal heritage and his legacy as an athlete. An athlete who played the game but refused to accept the abuse and through that refusal allowed us to have a better conversation about who we are and where we are going.
