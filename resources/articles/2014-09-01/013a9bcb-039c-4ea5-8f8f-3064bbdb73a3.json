At the end of what has been a hectic summer at St Mary\u2019s Ronald Koeman\u2019s side managed to make two impressive additions as several players left on loan. Alderweireld, 25, who plays mainly in central defence but can also fill in at right-back, joined from the Primera Division champions Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on a season-long loan with the option for a permanent move, which it is understood would cost Saints \u20ac8m (\u00a36.3m). Man\u00e9, 22, who plays in midfield, arrives on a four-year deal from Red Bull Salzburg for a fee understood to be \u00a310m, while Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez\u2019s move to Hull is the main outgoing player on the final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
