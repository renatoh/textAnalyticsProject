He has never started a season so poorly and he is very unhappy about it. But the Chelsea manager had a more categoric point to make. This was not 2007 all over again \u2013 the year when his first spell at Stamford Bridge ended in such an explosive fashion. His relationship with the owner, Roman Abramovich, remained solid. He was not going anywhere. \u201cLet\u2019s be objective,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the club in any circumstances. And the club doesn\u2019t want me to leave. I\u2019m not going to walk away. The club is not going to sack me. Point. Point. \u201cIf anyone thinks that I walk or I leave the job, it\u2019s somebody that doesn\u2019t know [the situation]. I think these people are not Chelsea fans because Chelsea fans know me for good and for bad, and that\u2019s not my profile \u2013 to run away from problems; in this case, to run away from bad results.\u201d Abramovich was at the club\u2019s training ground in Cobham on Friday, at around the time that Mourinho was holding his pre-Everton press conference and the manager stonewalled the inquiries about whether the pair had spoken, and about what. \u201cHe is the owner! He is allowed to visit his club,\u201d Mourinho exclaimed. The memory of his departure from Chelsea, which followed the breakdown of his relationship with Abramovich, remains clear. And with times tough at present, the questions that Mourinho faces, invariably, chip away at whether there is the scope for another meltdown. In 2007, Mourinho had been frustrated since January at the club\u2019s decisions on the transfer market, together with the one to appoint Avram Grant as the director of football. The situation came to a head after the 1-1 Champions League draw with Rosenborg in September \u2013 a game watched at Stamford Bridge by only 24,973 spectators. Mourinho\u2019s team had started that season with better results than this time \u2013 they have just four points from four Premier League matches so far. They go to Everton on Saturday lunchtime with players out of form and in urgent need of a tonic. During the past transfer window, Chelsea failed to sign Mourinho\u2019s top central defensive target \u2013 John Stones of Everton \u2013 although they did eventually land the Spain winger, Pedro, from Barcelona and Mourinho has frequently cut an irate figure. His latest setback is the news that Thibaut Courtois is a long-term casualty with a knee injury; the goalkeeper underwent surgery on Thursday. But Mourinho made it plain that he was a more content person now than he was in 2007, partly because he had achieved his target of managing in Italy and Spain, at Internazionale and Real Madrid respectively. There was also a classic Mourinho moment when he suggested that Abramovich himself had come to appreciate him more fully, having experienced life with a host of other managers since 2007. After Mourinho\u2019s exit, Abramovich worked with Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guus Hiddink, Carlo Ancelotti, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo and Rafael Ben\u00edtez. \u201cWhen I was here in 2007, I had two things on my mind,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cGo to Spain and go to Italy. Today, I have been in Spain and I have been in Italy. I don\u2019t want to go back. I want to stay here. That makes a difference. Mr Abramovich, in 2007, in his football life, he knows only two managers \u2013 [Claudio] Ranieri and myself. In this moment, he knows a lot of them. It\u2019s a difference too. So there are differences.\u201d Mourinho and Abramovich were able to patch up their relationship after the trauma of 2007\u2013 otherwise, as Mourinho noted, they would not be working together again \u2013 and the manager made the point that the owner had given him a new four-year contract at the beginning of last month. \u201cA few weeks ago, I have two years\u2019 contract,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cNow, I have four. It makes a difference.\u201d Mourinho has worked with only a handful of his players for the bulk of the past fortnight, due to the international break but heis optimistic ahead of the Everton game, insisting that the team\u2019s performances so far have deserved greater reward. \u201cWe have one problem,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWe are not getting the results we always expect to get. That\u2019s our problem. I never had four matches four points, never [at the start of a season]. \u201cI\u2019m not happy and I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m not happy. But I\u2019m optimistic. I trust the players and the players trust me. So it\u2019s not such a hard situation because you feel that better results will arrive. It\u2019s not something that you don\u2019t see the way to leave the situation. We are going to leave this situation, for sure.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
