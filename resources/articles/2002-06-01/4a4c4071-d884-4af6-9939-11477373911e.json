And it's not just passengers who are sick of it - airlines were complaining last week that BAA, which runs Gatwick and Heathrow, had reduced investment in gates and piers since 11 September and was concentrating on squeezing yet more glossy shops into every crevice. So it was a refreshing experience to visit an airport last week that was little more than a garden shed with a Pepsi machine. OK, I exaggerate, but I didn't have high hopes for Skavsta - Ryanair's Stockholm 'airport' which is an offputting 55 miles south (90 minutes by bus) from the city centre. But when the total return air fare over a bank holiday weekend is \u00a360, who's complaining? There is only one toilet in the arrivals lounge and a small shop to supplement the Pepsi machine, but it's less stressful than those big blighters like Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle in Paris and Amsterdam's Schiphol, where you have to arrive hours before your flight. I once arrived at Heathrow Terminal One 29 minutes before take-off for a flight to Berlin and was refused check-in because the airline staff said it would be impossible to get through security and run the distance to the gate in that time. They weren't joking. By contrast, when you fly from baby London City airport, they often let you on 10 minutes before take-off if you only have hand luggage and run up the escalator fast. At Skavsta you are through the airport in minutes. Get off plane, pick up baggage from the one carousel, go to the counter, buy a \u00a310 return ticket, get on the bus, and you are soon in central Stockholm. If you get to the airport early on your return and it's a nice day (as it was last Tuesday), you can lie on the grass outside the 'terminal' and sunbathe staring into the pine trees or admire the two private light aircraft on the runway, or count the cars in the long-term car park (six). I'm also a fan of M\u00f6nchengladbach, popularly called D\u00fcsseldorf Express. VLM flies there from London City. The airport is a good 45-minute bus and train ride to central D\u00fcsseldorf, but unlike the real D\u00fcsseldorf airport it takes minutes for you to be processed (according to its website, it takes just 15 minutes to check in - but I've done it in less). I'm not worried about security in shed airports. My daughter Hanna (aged two and 11 months) was treated like a suspected al-Qaeda member at Skavsta. Her half-eaten bag of Swedish-style cheesy Wotsits was snatched from her sticky fingers and passed through the X-ray machine. The six pockets of her multi-coloured rucksack of cuddly toys, colouring pads and pens were shaken and stirred to reveal a pair of plastic pinking shears. These were examined by six security guards who carefully placed them back in her bag with a pat and a smile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
