I told the zealot harassing me the jacket was a gift from a Native American shaman-clown, under whom I had studied. She backed down, humiliated, like Major General Arthur St Clair before the forces of Little Turtle and the Potawatomi, at the Battle of a Thousand Slain, on 4 November 1791. My accuser and I began a short but tempestuous relationship, based on the thrill of committing ever more offensive ideological thought crimes. One sick night, I imagined a public library with deliberately inadequate disabled access, while she made a scale model of a unisex toilet and then vandalised it. Within weeks, our imaginary atrocities exhausted, our twisted affair ended. But I realised there may have been some truth in my ex-lover\u2019s accusations of cultural insensitivity. Luckily, I still had the receipt for the jacket and so I returned the racist garment to Camden market, where I had bought it while shopping drunk months earlier. The idea of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d is a minefield, especially in the \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d times that we live in now, in today\u2019s \u201cpolitically correct\u201d world of \u201cso-called\u201d \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d \u201cgone mad\u201d. But I don\u2019t doubt for a moment that Michael Gove\u2019s decision to quote the rap singer Stormzy in a tweet on Tuesday was without malice. If Gove isn\u2019t a Stormzy fan how would the blotchy foundling know that the rapper\u2019s hit Shut Up included the phrase \u201cI set the trends dem man copy\u201d? Daniel Hannanananananananan\u2019s decision to reply to Gove\u2019s tweet with the emphatic urban phrase \u201cBig man ting!\u201d is less easy to justify. As the words do not relate to a specific Stormzy lyric, one can only assume Hannanananananananan thought them appropriate simply because Stormzy is black. It would be interesting to see if Hannanananananananan felt comfortable saying \u201cBig man ting!\u201d in person to a black person \u2013 Sir Trevor McDonald, Lizzo, Anthony Braxton, or Michelle Obama for example \u2013 while explaining his views on Brexit. \u201cAbsolutely nobody is talking about threatening our position in the single market. Big man ting!\u201d In short, would a \u201cBig man ting\u201d in the mouth of Daniel Hannanananananananan seem uncomfortable, or would it be a perfect fit, as if it had always belonged there? In the interests of full disclosure I must confess that I sing some Stormzy in my current show, Snowflake/Tornado. A line from Crown, \u201cheavy is the head that wears the crown\u201d, helps the audience understand the pressures I have faced since the Times declared me the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest living standup\u201d. But no one has suggested that I am racist quoting Stormzy, perhaps because I do not work for a man who has called black people \u201cpicaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. Minds immeasurably superior to mine have suggested that Gove\u2019s controversy-generating tweet was manufactured on his behalf by culturally savvy Conservative content providers, primed to cause plausible online distractions while dog-whistling to the coveted Arsehole Vote, historically a key part of any Tory victory. But Dominic Tosser Raab explained last week he thinks \u201cpeople don\u2019t give a \u2026 er \u2026 toss about social media\u201d, which is why his party doesn\u2019t spend money on re-editing news footage to smear their opponents online. Except that it does. Never mind. Tosser is probably confused, like when he didn\u2019t know the difference between sea and land. And anyway, if the Conservatives wanted to woo arseholes, they could just let Jacob Rees-Mogg open his mouth, instead of hiding him on a remote Somerset fen, like the flesh-eating recluse played by Don Henderson in The Ghoul (Freddie Francis, 1975), who said his hitchhiker victims deserved to be cooked and eaten because they lacked the common sense to not be cooked and eaten. It is likely that Gove, however, feels a genuine connection to Stormzy. Both men, for example, have been accused of using class A drugs, a charge Stormzy denies. But a young black man accused of class A usage would face the full force of the law, whereas an elderly white Conservative politician like Gove can admit to having snuffled as much cocaine as he likes and the offence is soon forgotten. Least said soonest mended, I always say. Gove was further traduced for saying Stormzy, who supported the Grenfell fire victims and funds scholarships to Cambridge University, should leave politics alone because he is \u201ca far, far better rapper than he is a political analyst\u201d. Black people, it seems, need to carry on singing and dancing for their masters and leave the thinking to big brains like Michael Gove. But is this interpretation of Gove\u2019s words unfair? What if Gove is such a Stormzy fan that he is afraid he will lose his idol from music to politics, and then there will be no more of the rap music that he loves? Is Gove trying to put Stormzy back in the black box simply because he loves him too much? If the online comment sewer is flowing beneath this piece this week, doubtless readers will ask why this column isn\u2019t questioning the Labour party\u2019s ongoing open-goal antisemitism shambles. This is a legitimate criticism, except that we have the entire rest of the media to ask that question repeatedly while, as usual, the Conservatives\u2019 relentless top-down racism remains relatively unexamined. It\u2019s a startling fact that 25% of the prison population is from a BAME background, whereas none of it is from parliament, perhaps due to the unequal systems of punishment Gove\u2019s non-conviction proves are in play. Had Gove been imprisoned for his drug offences, as he should have been, his fluency in urban slang would have been a great asset inside. \u201cAh! Stop it!! It hurts!!! My haggis nozzle!!!!
