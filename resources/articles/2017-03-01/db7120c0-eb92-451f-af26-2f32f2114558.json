Canada, who died after a stroke, has struggled with serious health complications since the San Francisco sheriff\u2019s office evicted her on 10 February, according to housing activists and Canada\u2019s family. \u201cIris Canada was betrayed by all the systems that were supposed to protect her,\u201d Iris Merriouns, Canada\u2019s niece, told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cShe would have lived longer had she not had to suffer so much. It was such a long, arduous fight.\u201d The death of the centenarian marks the end of a protracted battle that received international attention as a representation of gentrification and income inequality in San Francisco amid California\u2019s growing housing shortage. Canada\u2019s fight to stay in her first-floor two-bedroom apartment \u2013 her home of more than 50 years \u2013 began in 2014 when the owners first sought an eviction. Carolyn Radisch; her husband, Peter Owens; and his brother Stephen Owens had purchased the six-unit property in 2002 and granted Canada a \u201clife estate\u201d agreement, allowing her to remain until she died at a fixed rate of $700 a month. The owners claimed that Canada eventually stopped living in her unit and failed to maintain the property, but Canada and her family vehemently denied the accusations and said she wanted to remain in the unit until her death. The lengthy court fight \u2013 which included a judge granting more than ten requests for an eviction delay \u2013 came to a close when a court recently ruled in the owners\u2019 favor and ordered the San Francisco sheriff\u2019s office to proceed with the eviction. Officers subsequently changed the locks on Canada\u2019s door, prompting intense protests at the office of Sheriff Vicki Hennessy, who told activists that she was acting at the direction of the court. Canada\u2019s health worsened after the eviction, and she spent most of her time in recent weeks at the hospital, according to Merriouns. \u201cHer heart rate never returned to normal.\u201d By many measures, San Francisco is one of the most expensive cities in the country, and low-income renters, particularly longtime residents of color, have struggled to stay in the region as the technology industry has continued to exacerbate wealth disparities. \u201cIt was clear all along that this woman was not going to survive this eviction,\u201d said Tommi Avicolli Mecca, director of counseling programs with the Housing Rights Committee, a local advocacy group. \u201cSomething needs to be done to stop our seniors from being evicted. There\u2019s a lot of frustration, a lot of anger and a lot of sadness.\u201d Merriouns was in tears recounting her final conversations with her aunt, trying to explain to her why she was unable to go back home. \u201cShe just felt kind of thrown away,\u201d said Merriouns. \u201cShe was a person of dignity and pride, and she was not yelling and screaming. She was just simply saying, \u2018I want to remain in my home.\u2019\u201d In an interview with the Guardian at her home last October, Canada said: \u201cI love my house. This is my place. This is my furniture. Everything here is mine,\u201d adding, \u201cAll of this is killing me.\u201d Mark Chernev, an attorney for the property owner, said in an email on Tuesday: \u201cThe owners were saddened to hear of Iris Canada\u2019s passing \u2013 she lived a remarkable life and will be remembered fondly.\u201d Reached by phone, Eileen Hirst, chief of staff for the San Francisco sheriff\u2019s office, said: \u201cWe are very sorry to learn that Iris Canada has passed away.\u201d She did not comment further. \u201cEvictions have detrimental affects on your health,\u201d Mecca said, adding that for some people \u201cit is absolutely deadly\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
