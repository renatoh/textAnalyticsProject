A depleted United side enjoyed the bulk of possession against the champions elect in what Van Gaal described as their best performance to date under his stewardship, maintaining the form \u2013 if not achieving the result \u2013 that had resulted in them winning their previous six league games. Shaw gave his most impressive display since last summer\u2019s \u00a328m move from Southampton, the teenager a threat down the left in his first appearance in almost six weeks and only his 13th Premier League start of the season. There were positives to be taken from the display, with United the more proactive team for long periods, despite the absence of players such as Michael Carrick and Daley Blind resulting in Wayne Rooney, their most potent attacking threat of late, moving back into midfield in a rejigged lineup. The England captain suggested post-match that the display was evidence that United are \u201cimproving every week and can get better again\u201d following major changes to their coaching and playing staff last summer, and are \u201cnot too far behind\u201d Chelsea. \u201cI think that performance does lay down a marker,\u201d said Shaw. \u201cYou have seen the results of recent weeks, we keep improving and we want that to continue so that we can come out firing next season. Hopefully, this fixture could be a title decider next year. I\u2019m positive. It was my first performance for six weeks and I\u2019d like to think it was my best for United. I got forward a lot and felt really good on the pitch but everyone was brilliant out there. \u201cWe could have got more from the game. It was just one of those days: we created a lot of opportunities but nothing went in for us. You have seen what the manager has turned United into in recent weeks but that is because there is a really focused side, where you have to give 100% in every training session and game, and be focused all the time. If you don\u2019t give that, he won\u2019t play you \u2013 and that\u2019s what he is like.\u201d This season has been an education for Shaw. The 19-year-old travelled to the World Cup with England last summer after only two full seasons in the Southampton first team, starting the final group game against Costa Rica, and arrived at United as English football\u2019s most expensive teenager. Yet he immediately found his fitness criticised publicly by Van Gaal, and injuries have frustrated his progress in the period since. His form suffered as confidence waned, with the adjustment to new surroundings proving a difficult process. In a recent magazine interview, the player awarded himself a C minus for his initial impact at his new club and he remains painfully realistic about his adaptation to life at United. \u201cYes, it\u2019s been hard but I am still young and coming to the biggest club in the world hasn\u2019t been easy for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been playing and there have been a lot of negative comments about me. It is something that isn\u2019t nice and I\u2019ve tried to ignore it but, hopefully, this performance against Chelsea is the start of me coming back. \u201cI have family and friends who are helping me on my journey and the manager has been unbelievable as well. Over the last few weeks I have learned a lot from him and credit goes to him for trusting me in a big game like this one at Stamford Bridge. It\u2019s been a period where I\u2019ve been able to learn a lot more about myself. \u201cI saw a comment the other day saying I was taken off at half-time against Arsenal [in his previous appearance on 9 March] because I wasn\u2019t fit enough but that\u2019s not true at all. This is coming from me and I know what the manager pulled me off for and it wasn\u2019t for my fitness. I could have carried on in the game. I\u2019d felt my back a little bit and the manager just wanted to be careful because I am young and hopefully have a long future ahead of me. It wasn\u2019t anything about my fitness at all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
