The fall-out from the Scottish spat tumbles into a second week today, the club captain still barred from Bellefield and the manager disinclined - despite the Professional Footballers' Association's pleading - to mellow his resolve that Ferguson will not play for him again. Resolution must be reached this week; there is likely to be some measure of financial settlement on the remaining 18 months of the forward's \u00a334,000-a-week contract, though the Goodison coffers are bare. Moyes sees Ferguson, whose 28 league starts since rejoining the club from Newcastle for \u00a33.75m three years ago have effectively cost Everton \u00a3340,000 each, as a bad influence on his young team. \"Youngsters don't always perform every game,\" said the manager, though this was a good day, comfortable success briefly managing to eclipse the argument rumbling along disconcertingly in the background. A first win in six Premiership games was assured by two goals in three minutes in the first quarter. Everton should have run up a cricket score, so dominant was their play and so jittery was the Wolves response. But, given that everything smacked of anti-climax with the morning's World Cup final still fresh in the memory, it was no surprise that was as good as it got. Tomasz Radzinski's battered first from 25 yards eased the nerves. Wayne Rooney pirouetted and crossed for the excellent Kevin Kilbane to loop his first Everton goal beyond Michael Oakes moments later and the game was won. The lead established, Thomas Gravesen dominated midfield with some semblance of the form that had helped Denmark defeat England at Old Trafford a week earlier. \"He's a player who has strange ideas sometimes and it takes a lot of talking to him to get the message through,\" said Moyes, who will be anxious that the Dane can stamp his authority on a tighter game at Bolton next weekend. That still looms as a relegation struggle at the moment, though mid-table beckons for both clubs. Not so for Wolves. \"It was murder out there,\" Alex Rae complained. \"We were all over the place and it's hard to find any positives. It's how we react now that's important.\" Sloppy and outclassed here, they remain entrenched with little other than Nathan Blake's header from Kenny Miller's centre to offer hope. That was saved; Wolves may not be. Man of the match: Kevin Kilbane (Everton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
