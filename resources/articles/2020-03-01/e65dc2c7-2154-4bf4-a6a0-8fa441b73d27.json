My colleagues write: Wall Street is now braced for the Fed to step up its response to the threat posed to the global economy by the pandemic when it meets in Washington on Wednesday. The US central bank is expected to cut interest rates by at least half a percentage point and announce a fresh wave of the money-creation programme known as quantitative easing as it seeks to revive confidence among traumatised investors. Some analysts predicted that the Fed could go for a full one point off US borrowing costs \u2013 currently running in a range of 1% to 1.25% \u2013 amid fears that growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy could collapse over the coming months as more Americans are infected with the virus. Donald Trump, who triggered Thursday\u2019s market mayhem by imposing an EU travel ban, stepped up pressure on the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, to act. \u201cThe Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks,\u201d, the US president tweeted. \u201cJay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic &amp; physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also, STIMULATE!\u201d Right. Time to clock off for the weekend. Goodnight, and best wishes. GW Here\u2019s the scene on Wall Street tonight, as shares surged in late trading: In another significant move, Trump has pledged to waive interest on federal student loans and purchase crude oil to boost the country\u2019s strategic petroleum reserve. That should push crude prices up next week, potentially reassuring markets worried about Saudi Arabi\u2019a oil price war. And despite today\u2019s late surge, the S&amp;P 500 is still down nearly 9% this week - with the Dow losing 10%. A tough old week for the markets, again. One good day does not mean the worst is over, of course.... Boom! The US stock market has just posted its best day since 2008 - as Donald Trump declares a national emergency to combat the coronavirus. The S&amp;P 500 has closed over 9% higher tonight, gaining 230 points to 2,710 thanks to a late rally during Trump\u2019s speech. The Dow Jones also surged towards the finishing line, ending 9.36% higher at 23,185 points, a gain of 1,985 points (easily its best day in points terms ever). And Trump is continuing to tell Americans they can get through the crisis: It feels significant that Donald Trump lined up a series of US business leaders for his \u2018national emergency\u2019 press conference. A sign that the public sector and the private sector are going to work together on this crisis. My colleague Daniel Strauss explains: Trump moved on to introducing representatives from partner organizations working with the White House to combat the Coronavirus. They include representatives from Walmart, Walgreens, LHC Group, Signify Health. Most of the business people gave brief remarks about how eager their respective companies are to help. Stocks are rallying on Wall Street in late trading, as Donald Trump declares a coronavirus national emergency. After days of downplaying the severity of Covid-19, US president Donald Trump has now declared a national emergency over the pandemic. Speaking at the White House, Trump says the move will release about $50 billion in federal aid to fight the disease. It will \u201cunleash the full power of the federal government,\u201d said Trump, as he urged every state to set up emergency centres to help fight the virus. Our US Politics liveblog has all the details: Over on the Financial Times, Katie Martin has written an excellent piece about the market turmoil this week. As she points out, investors took an age (in financial terms) to wake up to the coronavirus threat, as they were too focused on financial risks. Thus the belated, huge, plunge in stocks when the pandemic risk became obvious. But also, there\u2019s an alarming lack of liquidity out there in the US government bond market. It\u2019s not as obvious as the share price moves, but it really, really matters.... She explains: The equity price falls are striking. But investors are even more unnerved by the fact that the plumbing behind markets started to creak this week. In particular, the most important market in the world \u2014 US government bonds \u2014 appeared to be short-circuiting. Every experienced trader will tell you that Treasuries \u201cshould\u201d be rallying while stock markets slide, providing a hedge to those who want one. But they are not, in part because of banks\u2019 unwillingness to act as go-betweens. \u201cTo me, it feels worse than 2008, more like the LTCM crisis,\u201d one hedge fund manager said. The \u201ctotal lack of liquidity in so-called liquid products\u201d means some funds will probably not survive this crisis, he added. That, plus the stress in US high-yield bonds, could topple more dominoes. If funds fail, they will have to sell more assets. If companies fail, banks and funds will be on the hook. Markets would be forced to keep pricing in more and more pain. Already, panic is feeding off itself. \u201cThe market has been jolted to the point of breaking, and textbook common sense seems to no longer apply,\u201d Nomura\u2019s Masanari Takada wrote. \u201cGiven the extreme uncertainty over what will happen, investors\u2019 own insecurities could cause a worst-case black swan scenario to actually unfold.\u201d The last week has been a story that investors, journalists and economists will tell their grandchildren about (and mightily bored they\u2019ll be!) Although we\u2019ve not actually seen any companies collapse, thank goodness, it has otherwise been just as gripping as the 2008 crisis. As Nomura put it tonight: As weeks go they don\u2019t get much more dramatic than this one. Rate cuts (in the case of the Bank of England at least), more QE (in the case of the ECB), sizeable (and in some cases not-costed) fiscal easing from the UK\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer, even Germany promising a stimulus plan and wild swings in the equity markets (especially in Italy). COVID-19 should continue to play havoc with economies and markets, health and wellbeing, in the weeks to come and we feel justified in having axed our growth and inflation forecasts this week, alongside adding to our expectations of monetary easing. A glimpse at the FTSE 100 leaderboard today shows that miners, online grocer Ocado and takeaway firm Just Eat had a good day, but travel companies, housebuilders and retailers struggled. Here\u2019s a reminder of this week\u2019s turmoil on the London stock market - which saw the worst day since 2008 on Monday, and the worst since 1987 on Thursday. And that was \u00a3275bn gone, in a flash. Currency analyst Michael Brown of Caxton FX reckons there\u2019s a big scramble for US dollars.... and problems finding enough US government debt. Unusual times, which will be contributing to the wild moves this week. After today\u2019s rally, all Europe\u2019s stock markets were a healthy shade of green. But since the start of 2020, they\u2019re flashing red - with losses of almost 30% since January 1. The coronavirus has already inflicted serious financial costs, well before the full economic and personal harm has taken place. Back on Wall Street, the rally is holding pretty firm. The main indices are all up around 4% today, a huge move in normal times, but rarely worth a second blink in the current climate of fear. Here\u2019s the score card, with two hours of a mad week to go: Dow: up 992 points or 4.6% at 22,192 S&amp;P 500: up 109 points or 4.4% at 2,590 Nasdaq: up 298 points ot 5.1% at 7,500 Boeing (+10%) and Goldman Sachs (+11%) are the top risers on the Dow, ahead of Walgreen Boots (+9.95%) and JP Morgan (+9.5%). Companies across America have been taking steps to address the coronavirus pandemic this week, with many such as AT&amp;T and JP Morgan activating home work policies. But the long-term economic impact of the shuttering of America will take weeks if not longer to assess. Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said the escalating response to the crisis from the US government, closing schools, banning large gatherings, will take a \u201csharp toll on the economy\u201d. Capital Economics has cut its US growth forecast for 2020 to just 0.6%, down from 1.8%. More here: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, agrees that the last week was a nightmare for savers and investors - large and small. \u201cIndividuals with cash in the bank were struck by news of interest rate cuts meaning returns on variable rate accounts are now next to nothing. \u201cAs for investors, they just experienced the worst period for stock markets since the 1987 crash and the 2008 global financial crisis. \u201cMany people don\u2019t realise their pension is likely to be invested in the stock market and sadly they often only find out when you get big crashes such as we\u2019ve just seen. \u201cIt just goes to show how the stock markets affect such a wide range of people, and not simply those looking to make a quick buck from buying and selling. \u201cIf there is a silver lining it\u2019s that markets ended the week with a rally. The FTSE 100 jumped 2.5% to 5,366 on Friday and the S&amp;P index in the US was 3.5% higher as the UK markets closed. That rebound follows signs that authorities are \u201cpulling out all the stops to prevent a sharp economic crash\u201d, Mould adds: \u201cThe German government said it would offer unlimited credit to companies affected by coronavirus disruption. This followed a pledge on Thursday by the US Federal Reserve to pump trillions of dollars into the financial system. \u201cChina cut reserve requirements for banks to ease borrowing conditions for companies and central banks in other parts of the world rolled up their sleeves. Japan announced plans to buy nearly $2 billion of dollars of government bonds and Norway followed many other countries by cutting interest rates. The best thing we can say about this week in the City is that it\u2019s over. Both the UK and European stock markets have just endured their worst week since 2008 The FTSE 100 has shed 17% this week - its worst showing since Lehman Brothers failed. The Stoxx 600 has lost 18%, with Germany\u2019s DAX losing 20% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down a breathtaking 23.3%. My rough calculation is that the FTSE 100 has lost \u00a3275bn this week, and over \u00a3500bn in the last three weeks of turmoil. After all that early morning excitement, the London stock market has closed with rather less drama. The FTSE 100 index has recovered less than a quarter of Thursday\u2019s bleak losses. It\u2019s closed 128 points higher at 5366, a gain of 2.5%. Mining companies BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto gained over 10%, with steel maker Evraz 12% higher. But cruise operator Carnival shed another 9%, and holiday operator TUI lost 6%. The FTSE 250 index also stumbled, losing 1% more. Phew! After Thursday\u2019s historic slump, European stock markets have posted a small, modest recovery. The Stoxx 600 index of the largest 600 European companies has closed around 1.4% higher. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB (+7%) and Spain\u2019s IBEX (+3.8%) led the way, after both country\u2019s banned some short-selling. After slumping 10% yesterday, that\u2019s only a small recovery. Germany\u2019s DAX barely rose at all, despite today\u2019s promise of financial aid. The leading German business daily, Handelsblatt, is reporting that Lufthansa, the nation\u2019s flagship airline will apply to the German government\u2019s multi-billion liquidity fund for help due to the financial fall-out from the coronavirus. In an internal video message to Lufthansa employees, the CEO Carten Spohr said the company would look to the German government for help, as well as entering discussions with governments in the other countries where it has a subsidiary, about possible state aid. A spokesman for the company, Europe\u2019s largest-grossing airline which last week announced it would cut its flights by 50 per cent in response to the health crisis, confirmed the reports. Spohr is due to participate in an emergency meeting with chancellor Angela Merkel and other industry bosses this evening at which the impact of the coronavirus on the German economy will be on the agenda. Thomas Jarzombek, the air industry coordinator in the government, has called representatives of the industry to a meeting this coming Monday, to discuss how to reduce the economic fallout. Jarzombek said the main aim was to work out what the air industry, just like other branches of industry, needed to get through the crisis. Jarzombek said: \u201cThe government is providing various instruments in order to help in cases of short term liquidity bottlenecks,\u201d he said, citing various government lending programmes. \u201cIf the need is there, they can be extended at short notice, be made more flexible or deployed in new ways.\u201d He said the main goal was to retain as many jobs as possible. Germany has announced \u201cunlimited\u201d aid to see businesses through the coronavirus crisis, with a starter plan of half a trillion euros. Finance minister Olaf Scholz said there was no upper limit to credit on offer from the state-owned KfW development bank. The government unleashed \u20ac550bn (\u00a3492bn) in government backed loans, which economy minister Peter Altmaier said was \u201cjust for starters\u201d. He vowed that no healthy company would find itself in trouble: \u201cWe will reload our weapons if necessary.\u201d The package is bigger than the \u20ac500bn aid offered during the 2008 financial crisis. As of this morning, Germany had seen 2,369 cases and five deaths from coronavirus. Germany\u2019s export-led economy is vulnerable to the rapid slowdown in world demand that began in China. More than half German companies surveyed by the ifo Institut this week reported negative effects from the coronavirus. Berlin, Bavaria and two other of Germany\u2019s 16 states have announced the blanket closure of schools and kindergartens, with more expected to follow. Deka Bank chief economist Ulrich Kater said Friday\u2019s guarantee package is a \u201cwhatever it takes from the government\u201d. He said the measures to help particularly small and medium-sized companies through the crisis are \u201cabsolutely sensible\u201d. \u201cThis is just the news that can stop the downward spiral.\u201d (thanks to AFP and Reuters for the quotes) Just in: Insurance giant AVIVA has suspended travel insurance sales, following other industry players. It says that travel insurance is designed to cover unforeseen events, while Coronavirus is a known event which creates a high likelihood that customers\u2019 travel plans will be affected. So insurance sales are now \u2018paused\u2019, from an hour ago. Investors are piling back into the US dollar...usually a sign that they\u2019re getting panicky. This dash for the greenback has driven the plucky British pound down below $1.24, the lowest since Boris Johnson agreed the new Brexit deal in October 2019. So much for the rally! The UK stock market is subsiding in the final hour. Traders must be getting edgy about what might happen this weekend, with Covid-19 cases continuing to rise in Europe and UK. So the FTSE 100\u2019s not up only 1%, making a tiny debt in last week\u2019s rout. And the smaller FTSE 250 (which has more UK-focused firms) is now down another 1%. That\u2019s despite French president Emmanuel Macron tweeting that leaders will hold a video conference on Monday to discuss a response to the crisis. Back on Wall Street, the early rally is fading a little. Stock are still up, with the Dow 520 points higher or 2.5% at 21,720. But after losing an incredible 2,350 points last night, investors were hoping for a stronger recovery. They\u2019re joking. I think.... Lloyds Banking Group has been forced to shut two of its offices this week, affecting nearly 2,000 staff, after discovering the first coronavirus cases across its workforce. Around 450 staff at its Edinburgh Citymark building are currently being asked to self-isolate, work from home or work from an alternative emergency site after a colleague was diagnosed with the virus. That site, where some of its tech and digitally-focused staff are based, remains closed. A Lloyds spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Edinburgh Citymark building will be temporarily closed to allow for the appropriate areas of the site to be cleaned, after a colleague based there was diagnosed with COVID-19. \u201cOur priority is the wellbeing of the individual, as well as the colleagues and visitors to the building. We\u2019re closely monitoring the developing situation and continue to follow official guidelines.\u201d Lloyds\u2019 Belfast Gasworks office, where around 1,500 staff call centre staff are employed, was closed on Monday after a separate case was confirmed. That office was fully reopened on Thursday. Veteran investor Warren Buffett has cancelled his annual shareholder meeting, due to the health risks of Covid-19. The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting usually attracts tens of thousands of small investors to Nebraska, keen to hear from the Sage of Omaha. Buffett is always good value, dispensing wise advice about investing in good times and bad ones. The event will be live-streamed instead. Hopefully Buffett will make up for any disappointment by playing a few tunes on his trusty ukulele.... British Airways got some grim news today - some will lose their jobs before this crisis is over. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, told them that it faces \u201ca crisis of global proportions like no other we have known\u201d and that lay-offs were inevitable... \u201cperhaps for a short period, perhaps longer term\u201d. More here: The head of the European commission Ursula von der Leyen has described the coronavirus as \u201ca major shock\u201d to Europe\u2019s economies, as she promised a multi-billion euro fund to handle the fallout. At a press conference in Brussels, von der Leyen said the coronavirus pandemic was an \u201cunprecedented challenge for our healthcare systems\u201d, but the EU could withstand the economic shock as long as member states \u201clived up to [their] responsibilities\u201d. She announced Brussels was increasing a coronavirus \u201cinvestment initiative\u201d to \u20ac37bn (\u00a333bn), up from \u20ac25bn proposed on Tuesday. The starting point is \u20ac8bn of unspent money from the EU budget for infrastructure spending - \u201csleeping money\u201d as von der Leyen put it - that is intended to trigger a further \u20ac29bn of public and private funds. But EU member states and the European parliament - currently meeting in restricted sessions because of the virus - will have to approve the idea. The commission also provided more details on measures announced earlier this week, such as loosening rules on state aid, and making use of flexibility in EU budget rules. Measures include: Relaxing airport slot rules. Airlines will not lose their prized landing and take-off slots, if they fail to use them as a result of travel bans and falling demand. A waiver on the usual \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d rule that requires carriers to use 80% of their slots, will run until 30 June 2020 and can be extended if necessary. Loosening rules on state aid, so governments can help companies by suspending tax payments or compensate those suffering losses. The commission said it had already signed off a Danish scheme in less than 24 hours, promising to do the same for other countries. Releasing \u20ac1bn from the EU budget, which is expected to cover \u20ac8bn in loan guarantees, with the aim of providing liquidity to 100,000 small and medium-sized companies. Governments will be able to use flexibilities in the EU stability and growth pact rules that restrict the deficit. In normal years a state\u2019s deficit cannot exceed 3% of gross domestic product. This rule will be relaxed under an \u201cunusual events\u201d clause, so governments can, for example, pay self-employed people or help companies that have put workers on half time, without facing fines from Brussels She also said France and Germany were \u201cwilling to adapt\u201d export bans on medical goods, such as masks and ventilators. Such restrictions flout EU rules on the free movement of goods and have angered countries that do not produce such products. Von der Leyen said the commission would do more if needed, delivering the message in the EU\u2019s three working languages of English, French and German. \u201cThis is an important economic package but we have to acknowledge the situation is evolving fast. We stand ready to do more as the situation evolves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to support the Europeans and the European economy.\u201d She also insisted EU authorities were fully behind Italy, following complaints from Italian politicians that Europe has gone missing in action when it comes to helping the country worst-affected by the coronavirus epidemic. Tech stocks and financial companies are leading the recovery in New York. Bank of America and Citigroup are up 7%, as Wall Street tries to put its worse day since 1987 behind it. Every stock on the Dow has risen, with chipmaker Intel (+10.3%), aircraft maker Boeing (+10.1%) and Walt Disney (+8.9%) hogging the top of a crowded list of rising stocks. BOOM! Stocks on Wall Street have rocketed higher at the start of trading. The S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones industrial average, and the Nasdaq all surged by 6% as the opening bell rang out in New York. After their worst losses in a generation, US stocks are firmly rebounding -- as hopes of a US economic relief package. The promise of more government spending in Europe, and the liquidity injections promised by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan in the last 24 hours are also helping. But volatility is absolutely soaring right now - as a truly historically wild week enters its last act. And don\u2019t forget, Wall Street slumped by 10% yesterday, so we\u2019re still down over two days. Tension is building on Wall Street, with shares expected to surge at the open following Thursday\u2019s shocking losses. With the futures contracts suspended, after jumping 5% overnight, who knows how the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 will perform in a few minutes? Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is trying to cheer traders, it seems: Germany has pledged to boost government spending to support its economy through the Covid-19 pandemic, breaking its long adherence to fiscal restraint and balanced budgets. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told a press conference in Berlin: \u201cWe have the financial strength to deal with this crisis. There is enough money there and we are deploying it. We are using all necessary measures to protect workers and companies.\u201d Although the stock market is surging, the City is eerily quiet. Walking down Moorgate towards Bank of England there is a marked absence of pedestrians and cars. It feels like a Sunday, my colleague Larry Elliott reports. Lloyd\u2019s of London has closed its underwriting today, as part of a stress-test of its resilience for a coronavirus shutdown. Anecdotally, many City workers have said they\u2019ve been testing home-working in recent days. Talks about a potential US stimulus package are continuing in Washington.... US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have spoken on the phone about an economic relief package to help protect the US people from the coronavirus economic shock. This is from Pelosi\u2019s chief of staff: The two sides had been split about how to respond to the crisis, on predictable lines. The Democrats are pushing for a package including paid leave for ill workers, higher jobless benefits and food aid, and free testing for coronavirus. President Trump, though, is insisting on tax cuts - a message he\u2019s just repeated on Twitter The bounceback is gathering pace in the City, with the FTSE 100 now up over 8% today - a gain of 430 points. Mining giants are leading the way, with BHP, Anglo and Glencore up around 15% each. British Airways owner, IAG,is also recovering strongly - up 13%. That would be match some of the wild swings we saw during the 2008 crisis.... the last time global markets were quite this spooked. Another dramatic Wall Street session looms..... Newsflash: The Bank of England has released the minutes of its emergency meeting this week, when it voted to cut UK interest rates from 0.75% to 0.25% They show that the Monetary Policy Committee believes UK economic activity will \u201cweaken materially\u201d over the coming months. It expects to learn more about the economic shock of Covid-19 in the weeks and months ahead. And if necessary, the MPC believes it has further tools to fight - including cutting bank rate again. It could also expand its offer of cheap loans for banks to pass onto businesses, also announced on Wednesday morning. A reminder that the markets have been here before (and will doubtless be here again): The FTSE 100 index is surging higher, up 7.3% today on hopes of international co-operation and a US stimulus package. The blue-chip index has now gained 383 points, taking it back to 5620 and away from last night\u2019s seven-year low. The news that Wall Street will surge in 90 minutes time is pushing up stocks across Europe. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 is also up 7%. That doesn\u2019t recover all of Thursday\u2019s huge losses (when the FTSE 100 lost 639 points. or 10%). But it\u2019s something of a boost to the City, where traders must be dizzy after the last few weeks. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will have conversations with other world leaders on Friday regarding the global response to the coronavirus outbreak, his spokesman said. He added that planning staff from the Ministry of Defence would help local authorities work out how to support public services so they can deal with the outbreak (via Reuters). That might reassure City investors that politicians could work together to limit the economic harm we face. The US stock market is expected to rally strongly when trading begins in a couple of hours. Trading in Dow and S&amp;P 500 futures has been frozen \u2018limit-up\u2019 at +5% -- meaning the market is likely to jump by more than 5% when the opening bell rings. Perhaps the latest interventions from central banks, including the Federal Reserve\u2019s $1.5trn liquidity push last night, is helping calm markets. Investors are also pinning hopes on a co-ordinated push by governments to calm the panic. Yesterday, the US Congress cancelled its planned recess next week so policymakers could work on a economic stimulus package to protect the US economy from a severe downturn. From the Footsie to the footie.... The Italian short-selling ban will include shares in two storied football clubs - Juventus and Lazio. Their revenues will be hit now Serie A games are being played behind closed doors. English games, meanwhile, are being suspended altogether for a month - an unprecedented move, that will also hurt club revenues, and have a knock-on impact on the hospitality trade. But as the Premier League says, \u201cthe health and welfare of players, staff and supporters are our priority\u201d. Three hours in, and the European rally is holding firm. FTSE 100: up 255 points or 4.8% at 5492 German DAX: up 337 points or 3.7% at 9,498 French CAC: up 182 points or 4.5% at 4226 Italian FTSE MIB: up 1,479 points or 9.9% at 16,373 Up to 50 million people in the travel and holiday sector could lose their jobs due to the coronavirus, an industry body warned today. The World Travel and Tourism Council fears that demand for international travel could slump by 25% this year -- causing 12-14% of workers in the sector to be laid off. The WTTC wants governments to cut travel taxes, simplify the visa process, and support companies affected. Another central bank has eased monetary policy - and this time it\u2019s China. The People\u2019s Bank of China is allowing Chinese banks to hold less capital in reserve, freeing up more funds to support their customers. This cut in China\u2019s reserve requirement ratio will free up 550 billion yuan (\u00a360bn) into the economy, PBoC says. The Spanish stock market authorities have also banned the short-selling of some stocks, which has pushed the IBEX index up 5% this morning. But curbing speculation won\u2019t fix the looming economic crisis, as Pierre Veyret of ActivTrades writes: Share markets are rebounding slightly on Friday in an attempt of a price stabilization following the worst sell-off since the 1987 crisis. This bullish opening on EU shares has been boosted by the decision from Spanish and Italian regulators to ban short-selling on certain stocks, with these two benchmarks currently the best performers in the eurozone. However, the uncertainty persists on risky assets as coronavirus cases and the associated death toll continues to soar. The virus is spreading fear and panic further across the world and putting pressure on entire industries. Covid-19 has already slowed several businesses down and investors remain worried stimulus by central banks won\u2019t be enough to offset the negative impacts across the world. Markets are now entering an irrational-like state with prices heading for their worst week since 2008. Most stock traders now have one major question in mind: where\u2019s the bottom? The Bank of Japan\u2019s pledge to keep the markets flush with liquidity is helping markets recover, reckons IG\u2019s Sara Walker. Gracious, it\u2019s choppy in the City today. The FTSE 100 is clambering higher, up 210 points or 4% to 5452 after two hours of trading. And a clear picture is emerging -- major international companies are rising today, with oil giant Royal Dutch Shell 8%, and miners such as BHP and Anglo American up around 10%. But companies reliant on discretionary spending are falling again. Obviously that includes the holiday operators. Retailers, such as JD Sports (-2.5%) and housebuilders such as Barratt (-2%), are out of favour too, as traders anticipate the impact of a recession and isolation measures. Whitbread, which runs the Premier Inn chain of hotels, are down 1.7% too. A reminder of Australia\u2019s wild trading session overnight: There\u2019s always a danger that stock market rebounds are merely \u2018dead cat bounces\u2019 -- a swift, but short recovery before another tumble. Fiona Cincotta of City Index has sent this chart over, showing how recent rises (white blocks) have been followed by sharper falls (the black blocks). She explains: After stocks experienced the worst sell of since Black Monday over 3 decades ago, there is a sense that the market has more than priced in the negative impact that coronavirus headwinds could bring. Let\u2019s not forget that China has recorded the lowest level of infections with just 8 new confirmed cases. This proves that with containment measures such as lock down, strict quarantine and travel restriction it is possible for a country to rebound and relatively quickly. China has sent a specialist team to Italy to help get control over the outbreak. There is light at the end of the coronavirus tunnel, which in Europe and US we are just entering. However, the chart is not quite so convincing. Any stronger starts that we have seen this week have not been sustained into the afternoons so there is plenty of caution on trading floors this morning. Italy\u2019s stock market is having a better day, with the FTSE MIB index up almost 5% this morning. The overnight ban on short-selling may be helping, as it prevents speculators driving a firm\u2019s share price down. But it\u2019s only a small relief, as the FTSE MIB slumped by almost 17% yesterday alone. France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, is trying to calm the markets too. He told the BFM TV channel that Paris will support companies in which the government holds shares, pledging: \u201cWe will help all companies in which the state has a stake, Air France, Renault. What ever it costs we will be at their side and will support them. Le Maire didn\u2019t give more details. But he did suggest that the overall cost of helping French businesses and workers would run into \u201cdozens of billions of euros.\u201d He also described Donald Trump\u2019s EU travel ban as an \u201caberration\u201d: An hour into the trading session, the FTSE 100 is 2% higher at 5347. That\u2019s 109 points higher than last night\u2019s close (when the Footsie slumped 10% to its lowest point since 2012), but down on the 8am bounce. Mining companies are leading the 78 risers, along with supermarket chains Morrisons (+5%) and Tesco (+4%). But there are now over 20 fallers, led by cruise firm Carnival (-11%),holiday firm TUI (-7%) and budget airline easyJet (-4%). Investors worldwide are extremely jittery, as Russ Mould of stockbrokers AJ Bell reports: \u201cThe story in Asia Pacific markets overnight was one of extreme volatility. Aussies stocks endured a real boomerang of a session \u2013 the more than 12% swing from its low point to an eventual 4.4% gain reflects just how frazzled investors are just now. Asia also saw see-saw trading \u2013 with most markets ultimately rebounding from their lows. \u201cThe VIX volatility index suggests markets are as jittery as they have been at any time since the financial crisis. Japan\u2019s central bank has announced it will take steps to boost the amount of liquidity in the markets. This will include the use of \u2018repo\u2019 operations -- where a central bank provides cash in exchange for collateral such as government bonds. This would prevent a bank running out of liquidity, if other banks were too nervous to lend to it. Reuters has the details: The Bank of Japan said on Friday that it would provide \u201cample liquidity\u201d using market operations and maintain stability in the repo market to help stablise financial markets. The BOJ also said in a statement that it had conducted unscheduled purchase of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) on Friday. Norway\u2019s central bank has slashed interest rates this morning, in an unexpected move to protect its economy from Covid-19. The emergency move cut Norwegian interest rates from 1.5% to 1%, and follows unscheduled rate cuts in the UK, US and Canada in recent days. The Norges Bank warned: \u201cThere is considerable uncertainty about the duration and impact of the coronavirus outbreak, with a risk of a pronounced economic downturn.. It added that its rate-setting committee is \u201cmonitoring developments closely and is prepared to make further rate cuts.\u201d ING economist David Smith says the move was forced by the sharp fall in oil prices, and also in global interest rate expectations: Hmmm... this morning\u2019s rally is losing more momentum - with the FTSE 100 now up around one hundred points still (nearly 2%). As Connor Campbell of SpreadEx puts it: Driven by its miners \u2013 Rio Tinto, BHP Group and Anglo American were all up between 9% and 12% \u2013 the FTSE climbed 100 points to just about cross 5450. That already marks a sharp pull back from the 6%-plus bounce seen in the moments after the open, suggesting that equities have a job on their hands convincing investors to stick with them until closing time. It\u2019s probably also worth noting that, even with this rise, the UK index is has shed almost exactly 2000 points in the last 3-weeks. Savers and pension holders will welcome any rally today. But today\u2019s rebound looks rather unimpressive, in the context of the last few days: After that early surge, the UK and other European markets have stabilised up around 3% to 4%. Correction: Australia\u2019s market finished UP 4%, not down as I mistyped earlier. Even better! Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized firms is also rallying, but with less oomph than its big sibling. The FTSE 250 has gained almost 2% in early trading. But Cineworld (which might breach its banking covenants if forced to close cinemas) are down 13%, and Restaurant Group (Frankie &amp; Bennies, Wagamama) are down another 5%. The threat of mass sporting cancellations is hitting gambling firms, with William Hill down 6%. European stock markets are also recovering, after a historic 10% plunge on Thursday. Germany\u2019s DAX has risen by 3.5% at the open, with financial stocks such as Deutsche Bank (+7%) and Commerzbank (+11%) among the risers. Shares are surging back in London, as the stock market reopens after Thursday\u2019s rout. A massive early burst of buying has lifting the market back up from last night\u2019s seven-year lows. The FTSE 100 has leapt by over 6%, or 332 points, back to 5565 points. Almost every share is rising sharply. Mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are leaving the rally, up over 13% each. Insurance firm L&amp;G has gained 10%, as some calm returns to the City. It\u2019s still early days, but this might calm some nerves. One company is still tumbling, though -- cruise operator Carnival is down another 7%. Covid-19 has reached Britain\u2019s business leaders. Telecoms firm BT\u2019s CEO, Philip Jansen, has tested positive for the virus -- making him (we think) the first publicly confirmed case among FTSE 100 bosses. He\u2019s now self-isolating, and keeping working. Jansen said in a statement: \u201cHaving felt slightly unwell, I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve met several industry partners this week, so felt it was the responsible thing to do to alert them to this fact as soon as I could. \u201cGiven my symptoms seem relatively mild, I will continue to lead BT but work with my team remotely over the coming week. There will be no disruption to the business.\u201d More here: Stock market regulators are taking steps to shore up the markets. Overnight, Italy\u2019s watchdog announced a temporary short-selling ban on some stocks - to prevent speculators from selling shares they don\u2019t own (and buying them back cheaper). Britain\u2019s FCA says the move will also affect Italian banks traded in the City. South Korea has announced a similar move too: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World markets are in panic mode, after the worst day since 1987 on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday. Investors are grappling with three questions; how bad the coronavirus pandemic will become, how serious an economic downturn it will cause, and whether policymaker will intervene decisively and effectively. (Many will also be pondering why they didn\u2019t sell three weeks ago, but this is no time for introspection). It\u2019s already been a wild Friday in Asia-Pacific. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index plunged by 10% at one stage, matching the horror scenes on the London and New York stock exchange on Thursday. Australia\u2019s market saw blistering selling too, sending the S&amp;P/ASX200 down 8% at one stage. But.... there was a late mini-recovery, meaning Tokyo *only* finished 6% lower, with Sydney UP 4.4%. And that means European markets MIGHT have a better morning. That late comeback in Asia may show hopes of a co-ordinated fiscal and monetary response to the crisis over the weekend, or may suggest that some investors think the sell-off has gone far enough. Last night, the US Federal Reserve delved into its arsenal -- pledging to inject at least $1.5tn into the markets, and to restart its bond-buying programme. That, though, didn\u2019t prevent fresh losses on Wall Street. So what for Europe and the US today? Frankly, who knows how the next few hours will play out. But it\u2019s not going to be a gentle ride. As things stand, the FTSE 100 is expected to rebound by at least 3% - bringing some relief to the City. Wall Street is also being called higher -- with Dow futures up over 800 points. That wouldn\u2019t even recover Thursday\u2019s rout, though, let alone the losses of the last three weeks. But traders may be grateful for what they can get. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at Swissquote, warns it could be a volatile day: The FTSE 100 tanked 640 points yesterday to the lowest levels in more than seven years. The 30-billion-pound fiscal support, the 50-basis-point interest rate cut, nor the additional monetary stimulus package helped improving appetite in British stocks. Banks, energy and mining stocks lost big. Trading on FTSE futures (+3.30%) hint that the British blue-chip index may lick its wounds today. Cheaper sterling and steady oil should give some support to the index, but gains remain fragile. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day. Hold tight.
