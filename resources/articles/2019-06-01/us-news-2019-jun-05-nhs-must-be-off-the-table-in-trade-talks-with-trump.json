Having grown up in a village in rural Scotland where nobody ever called the doctor because they wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay the bill, she often told us of the revolution in healthcare which the NHS made possible, and about the gratitude of ordinary folk nursed free of charge in hospital through diphtheria, tuberculosis, scarlet fever and the like. I can hardly imagine her reaction on hearing that only 70 years later the United States wants the NHS to be \u201con the table\u201d in a future trade deal (Trump snubs Corbyn and eyes up NHS in trade talks, 5 June). Have we already forgotten how things used to be? Susan Tomes Edinburgh \u2022 As bizarre as the proposition might seem, I presume that if the US\u2019s position is that something as fundamental to our way of life as the NHS is going to be on the UK\u2019s side of the table in any post-Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and the US, then the UK could argue that gun control should be on the US\u2019s side. After all, and to use Donald Trump\u2019s own words, \u201cwhen you\u2019re dealing on trade, everything is on the table\u201d. I am sure that there are many in the UK who would much prefer to have the US as a major trading partner if it took steps to address the carnage caused by its virtually unregulated gun market. Harvey Sanders London \u2022 So can we expect the Brexit bus slogan to be changed to \u201cLet\u2019s send our \u00a3350m a week to the US instead\u201d? Daryll Twigger Almondbury, West Yorkshire \u2022 Far better for Britain to remain in the EU than to become the 51st state of America. Protecting our NHS must now stop Brexit.
