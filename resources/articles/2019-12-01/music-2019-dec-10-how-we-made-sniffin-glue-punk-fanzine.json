I used to buy the NME and read about New York punk: the Ramones, Patti Smith, Television. When the Ramones\u2019 debut album came out, it sounded so fresh and exciting. I was blown away. A kid like me would never have thought the music business was for them, but when you heard the Ramones, you thought: \u201cI can do this.\u201d I wanted to be involved even though I wasn\u2019t a musician. There were fanzines, but they were for more marginalised music, like blues and country. Inspired by the Ramones track Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue, I thought it would be great to do a punk fanzine. I had an old children\u2019s typewriter I had got for Christmas one year and used that. I crossed out in pen where I needed to and used felt tip for the headlines. It was very basic. Looking back, it looks like some kind of DIY statement but the aesthetic template for punk didn\u2019t exist at that point. I was just doing the best I could, with whatever was available. The first issue didn\u2019t have many pages and there were no photographs. The main thing was a review of the Ramones. I never took them by hand to sell at gigs. I was lazy, so I sold them through record shops \u2013 Rough Trade, Virgin. Using their distribution networks, you could get them to pretty much every shop in the country. Punk was like a bomb going off. It changed my life. Within a few months of starting Sniffin\u2019 Glue, I had quit my job. By issue four, we were talking about taking over the music business. The demand grew and record shops would front me money to get more copies printed. We started getting them made at the printers and soon had loads of great photographers contributing. An attitude was formed that set it apart from the music papers. We wrote about bands in a way that said: \u201cGo and see them. They will change your life. You\u2019re going to cut your hair off, leave your job and form a band.\u201d I was in the right place at the right time. It might be a legendary fanzine now but it didn\u2019t seem so then. Years later, I\u2019m proud of the impact it had on what came next: other punk fanzines such as London\u2019s Burning, 48 Thrills, Ripped and Torn; as well as i-D and the Face, whose DIY ethos and strong stylistic identity owed so much to those early fanzines. For me, punk died the day the Clash signed to [major label] CBS in 1977. I wrote that at the time. By mid-77, I had a talent-scouting job at Step-Forward Records and had started my own band, Alternative TV. It was too much to do all three. Plus, I felt the zine was getting diluted. So I thought: \u201cTwelve issues and then stuff it.\u201d And that\u2019s what we did. We printed 20,000 copies of the final issue with Alternative TV\u2019s first single as a giveaway flexi-disc. Sniffin\u2019 Glue had said what it needed to \u2013 and went out on a high. Danny Baker, writer I came on board halfway through. I remember thinking Mark was nuts when he started it. We\u2019d put each issue together in a condemned building behind Oxford Street. Stewart Copeland, the drummer in the Police, gave us his office in there. There would be thousands of copies of each page arranged in piles on a table. We\u2019d come back from a night out at the Roxy, do a line of speed and walk round the table all night, taking a page from each pile. You\u2019d get to the end, put a staple through them, then start again. In the morning, you\u2019d have 10,000 Sniffin\u2019 Glues. I was surprised Mark decided to end it but he said: \u201cThis is the punk thing to do. It\u2019s all on Top of the Pops now. It\u2019s on the major labels. Let\u2019s finish it.\u201d We had \u00a390 in the bank, which we spent on the flexi-discs for the final issue. Mark doesn\u2019t get half the credit he deserves. You\u2019ve got your Malcolm McLarens and your Bernie Rhodes, but Mark was the real thing \u2013 a council estate kid who started his own magazine. To me, that was like him flying to the moon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
