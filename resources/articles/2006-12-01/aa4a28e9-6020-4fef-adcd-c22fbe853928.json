So, with Wenger claiming on Friday that Arsenal can do the same again, what to make of this victory over the same opponents? Especially when it was a game that, with 20 minutes remaining, looked more likely to finish 3-3 than the highest-scoring game in the Premiership this season. Asked to reinforce his comments about the title, all Wenger would say was: 'This team can go further.' Key here was the performance of Emmanuel Adebayor, with the Togo striker clearly revelling in the fact that he is now playing regularly, because of the extended absence of Thierry Henry, who was here at the Emirates, dressed stylishly for the cold. His team-mates wrapped up this game with similar panache thanks to three goals in the last five minutes. 'He has developed recently. He has gained in confidence,' observed Wenger of the man he bought in January from Monaco. The pattern this season at the Gunners' home games has been for them to fall behind and then struggle to gain a point. The first part of that trend was observed once more, but what resulted was not in keeping with the recent past. For that, Wenger should have given his opposite number Mark Hughes a whopping great Christmas present. Most visitors have tended to pack the midfield and trust to scoring on the counter-attack before sitting back, which has frustrated Arsenal into five home draws. However, Hughes opted for width in midfield and the pace and strength of Shabani Nonda and David Bentley. That proved to be his undoing, as Arsenal were able to move the ball forward as quickly as they liked without getting stuck in a midfield glue or coming up against a massed defence. The outcome should have been clear when Arsenal went into the break 3-1 up, but Blackburn muddied the waters through a combination of some sloppy defending and simply refusing to go quietly. When Nonda scored his second, with an overhead kick, the Gunners looked nervous. Wenger admitted as much, saying: 'At 3-2 we were a bit exposed and Jens Lehmann had to make some saves. Our desire to go forward can end up costing us. But we are never boring.' Once more, Rovers felt they could extract a point and they committed themselves forward in numbers, but were left exposed. As Hughes said: 'We could just have tried to limit the damage at 3-1, but instead we were positive.' Bentley, returning to play against the side in which he grew up as a footballer, seemed intent on punishing Wenger for letting him go. After 110 seconds he was brought down by Kolo Toure and Nonda converted the penalty with ease. Toure wanted to make amends and did so after 10 minutes, earning a corner from which Gilberto Silva headed inside the far post. Bentley continued to try his luck but it was his opposite number, Adebayor, who was to profit most on this afternoon. After 23 minutes, he slipped a pass to Alexander Hleb and the Belarus midfielder waltzed around Andy Todd before finding the bottom corner. Arsenal's movement was now proving too much for Rovers' static defence and four minutes later the hosts' lead was two goals. Robin Van Persie ran on to a lobbed ball and, when ready to shoot, Lucas Neill tripped up the Dutchman. Adebayor's penalty was as clinical as Nonda's. Apparently coasting to victory, Arsenal found themselves back in a close game when Blackburn scored their second. Brett Emerton reached the byline and crossed to substitute Matt Derbyshire. He sent his diving header against the crossbar, but the rebound fell for Nonda. More anxious moments followed, including Lehmann pushing a shot from Morten Pedersen over the bar, before Arsenal finally converted their overall superiority. With five minutes remaining, Van Persie turned Andre Ooijer one way and then the other before curling a delightful shot inside the far post. That, admitted Hughes, 'knocked the stuffing out of us'. The fifth goal came after Adebayor found Cesc Fabregas. He slipped the ball to Van Persie and the Dutchman had his second of the day. Wenger was in ecstasy. 'That was a real Arsenal goal, a collective one,' he said. The sixth was pretty good too, he added, as Fabregas toyed with Robbie Savage before cutting the ball back for Mathieu Flamini, who rounded the afternoon off in fine style from 10 yards. Man of the match: Emmanuel Adebayor The Togolese centre-forward has caused better teams trouble this season, as Manchester United can testify after he scored the winner there this campaign. It also helps when you know you have the beating of your marker. But he was inspired here in front of his home supporters, setting up one goal and converting his penalty without fuss."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
