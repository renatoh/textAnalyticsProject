A cannonade of three goals in nine first-half minutes ensured Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side fully exploited their rivals' Easter Monday inactivity and returned to the top of the table, maybe for good. For a team of this quality in this form, holding a one-point lead at this stage with a match in hand, something must go horribly wrong for them not to finish first. Charlton's unbeaten run of a dozen matches against London opposition became an anorak statistic as Arsenal continued to pursue the more significant record of completing a league programme without an away defeat. It is this consistency on the road, in the Premiership if not the Champions League, that has enabled them to live with an occasional fallibility at Highbury and maintain their title challenge. For that reason few Arsenal supporters will be looking much further beyond Saturday's north London derby at home to Tottenham, an encounter rich in foot-shooting potential. But after a bank holiday that has brought them six points and six goals with none conceded, there is now the strong possibility that Arsenal will be visiting Old Trafford next month already wearing the crown Manchester United have worn so often they may get a head cold without it. \"Let's play Tottenham first,\" said Wenger when the hypothesis was put to him. Nevertheless he is even more convinced that his team would soon be champions. \"I hardly look at the results of anybody else,\" he confessed. \"I just know that we will be champions, if we keep winning. We believe we can do it because of the strength, physical and mental, there is in the squad.\" The loss of Robert Pires has not been allowed to cast a shadow over Arsenal's run-in. Injuries, however, continue to dog them. Yesterday Ashley Cole, just recovered from damaged knee ligaments, aggravated the injury in a tackle with Graham Stuart and was forced off just before the half-hour. He will have a medical today. \"It is bad news for us and England,\" Wenger said. \"He says it is not as bad as the first time, and he looks optimistic, but he will be out for Saturday.\" On the brighter side, for club and country, Martin Keown looked none the worse for a two-month absence mending a broken leg, and Arsenal will have taken comfort from his performance yesterday. Charlton's defence did not lack energy but its deficiencies were ruthlessly exploited by Arsenal's mix of speed, accurate, imaginative passing and intuitive movement off the ball. \"When you play these sides you always are aware of one thing, their pace,\" reflected Alan Curbishley, the Charlton manager. \"How many times do you see them beating offside or catching a defence square and then scoring from three or four yards?\" Yesterday Arsenal did this enough times to double their winning margin. Had Jason Euell or John Robinson, queuing up unmarked, managed to get a foot to the low centre from Jonatan Johansson in the second minute Charlton might have at least given Arsenal a reminder of their 4-2 victory at Highbury in November. In the event this was an irrelevant memory by the 25th minute. Just past the quarter-hour the strength of Sol Campbell's lunge to dispossess Euell turned the tackle into an inspired pass that sent Thierry Henry on a long, lone sprint to shoot low past Dean Kiely. Five minutes later Henry spun off Richard Rufus before finding Dennis Bergkamp free on the right, the Dutchman's narrow-angled shot turning itself into a tap-in for Fredrik Ljungberg at the far post. Another four minutes and a broad move by Bergkamp, Ljungberg and Sylvain Wiltord provided a similar chance for Henry's 30th goal this season. The rest, apart from David Seaman readjusting admirably to turn Euell's attempt to lob him over the bar, was a formality. Not so the championship . . . not yet anyway. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
