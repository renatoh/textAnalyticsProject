I forgot to switch my phone off and it rings. It's my friend Hannah, so I answer it, because she is a massive fan of MasterChef and may have an interesting question for him. Hannah actually pretends to be on MasterChef with her husband at home; they get ingredients in, have a cook-off, then taste each other's efforts saying things that John or Greg might say on the show, such as, \"Then in comes the lovely saltiness of those capers.\" \"G'day Hannah, how are ya?\" Torode says into my phone, suddenly sounding more Australian. \"Absolutely not, no, not at all,\" he says to Hannah. \"I love the format, it's the most fantastic format in the world.\" There's a pause while she says something else. \"Well, I tell you what,\" says Torode. \"You keep on watching, 'cos things might change.\" Oh dear, it seems she's asked about whether the MasterChef formula is getting a little stale and predictable and I've already asked him about that. He's probably getting paranoid now. He says he thinks MasterChef will grow and change and evolve just as it has done up to now. It has come a long way since it was a Sunday afternoon show, presented by Loyd Grossman. The format was played around with, it was switched to the evening, Gary Rhodes was given a turn at the helm. But it was really only when the show was handed to Torode and his sidekick, fruit and veg man (and King Edward looky-likey) Greg Wallace, that the show really took off. Something about their blokiness, emotional honesty, colourful language, their rivalry and the strange way they never address the camera appealed. Now MasterChef is something of a phenomenon, with a celebrity version and 6 million viewers, not to mention loons like my friend Hannah pretending to be on the show at home. \"Cooking doesn't get tougher than this,\" they shout to each other as they open a can of beans for tea. Torode grew up in Maitland, New South Wales. His mother died when he was four and his dad was off working most of the time so he was brought up by his grandmother. He wasn't into playing rugby league like the other kids at school, preferring the exciting smells of his grandma's kitchen. She was, he says, an amazing cook, a proper cook. \"She cooked good lamb chops with peas and you know, boiled potatoes. Her caramel slice was legendary.\" Over here, he may be seen as a brash Aussie, but he says he didn't really fit in down there. \"I'm here because what I wanted to do was to cook. I really enjoyed it, and I'm not . . . well, I love golf, I love cricket, all that sort of stuff, but I'm not [puts on exaggerated comedy Crocodile Dundee Australian accent] a bloke.\" He's a rubbish Aussie in other words. \"Well yeah, I was pretty shit as an Australian.\" So he came over here, married a pom, had a couple of kids, joined the Conran Group, cheffed at Pont de la Tour and Quaglino's and became part of the whole Australiafication of food that was going on in the 1990s. He split from the first pom, got himself another, had a couple more kids. Now he's got his restaurant, the four-storey Smiths, near Smithfields meat market. And he's got another, the LUXE, opening soon in London's fashionable Shoreditch. \"I mean how frigging lucky am I?\" he says. \"Every day I wake up and look in the the mirror and go: really? Is this really what's happening? I mean it's just fantastic. But people tell me to keep my head on my shoulders, don't be a prick, and you'll survive.\" Is he? A prick? \"I think sometimes I'm very hard, but I don't think I'm a prick, no.\" I don't think the innuendo is intentional here, it's just the way it comes out. But he does mean it when we're talking about chicken and he asks me if I'm a leg or a breast man. As the Albarino (an elegant white wine that needs to be said with an Aussie accent \u2013 honestly, try it) slips down, he becomes a less shit Australian. Badly cooked scallops are \"like little globs of snot\". The only three definites in life, are: \"You're going to eat, you're going to shit, and you're going to die.\" You get the idea, he's not Fanny Cradock. But it's fun. Having lunch with John Torode is fun. The breast-man-leg-man thing came up because, after a successful beef book, he's now done one about chicken, or a chook book, as he calls it. A chicken is an extraordinary thing, he says. \"It's adaptable, it's easily used, it's probably the easiest thing to please everybody with. You roast a chook, you put it on the table, and regardless of who you are, and what you are, you'll find a bit that you'll actually like. Unless you're a vegetarian.\" There are Thai curries in his book, chicken soups, his gran's best ever roast chook. And it isn't just about chickens, it's about other fowl too \u2013 ducks, geese, turkeys, quails, pheasants, pigeons. He mentions a dish the journalist Rosie Boycott cooked on Celebrity MasterChef that involved partridges and pears. It was an unlikely, but surprisingly successful combination. Flavour combinations \u2013 that's the big thing about MasterChef. The show may be more about theatre than about cooking, but you do learn a bit about what goes with what. Please can I have a few private pointers and tips to take home with me? \"It's not necessarily about what goes with what,\" he tells me. \"It's about what your body believes should go with what. So let's take fish, chips and vinegar. Fish and chips by nature are greasy, so we put vinegar on it and we like it because it helps our digestive system. The vinegar breaks down the fat. Tomatoes and mozzarella work very well together because the milk is rich in summer when the grass is very very green, and makes the best mozzarella in the world, same time as the tomatoes are around and beautiful bushy basil.\" He is slipping into MasterChef speak. It's the same, he says, with wine \u2013 we drink wine with, say, steak because it helps digest it. And because it's delicious. He pours me another glass of Albarino, which seems to be digesting my rabbit very successfully. There's one round in MasterChef I think isn't really fair, and I'm not sure tells you much about the contestant's ability as a cook; the ingredient identification round. But John says it's fair, because they're coming on and professing to be this really high calibre, and they're just finding out if they have what it takes to win the competition. So, could he identify any kind of meat, for example? \"Why, have you got something weird in your bag?\" Yes, as it happens. \"I probably couldn't identify elephant.\" It's not elephant. It's actually elk (or moose), smoked, I think, in thin little slices. Someone brought it from Norway as a present and it's been sitting in the fridge for ages. I was wondering what the hell we were going to do with it, until I was asked to interview Torode. I hand him a piece. \"Classic, I love this sort of thing,\" he says. He's being very game about it, sporting even, but I reckon I can smell fear underneath the bravado. \"It looks like a bit of bresaola [dried, salted beef] to me . . . it's been rolled, it's been smoked. It's very dark for pork, I don't think this is pork \u2013 well, saying that . . . This has been done in quite a large factory, you can tell by how thin it is.\" He tastes it. \"It's oversalted, overcured, it doesn't taste of meat any more, which means it's highly processed, and I would dare say it would come from a supermarket like Sainsbury's. And I reckon it's supposed to be smoked cured beef.\" He should know beef, he's written a bloody book about beef. Final answer? \"Final answer.\" Ha, it's moose! Elk if you prefer. But in no way beef, about which you've written a book. \"Well at least it was a red-blooded animal, and it wasn't a pig. I would've been in big shit if I'd said pork.\" To be fair, he's taking it pretty well, but I reckon he's hurting inside, like Ricky Ponting when he lost the Ashes. Right, any chance of another bottle of that nice Albarino, to help digest the moose? \u2022 John Torode's Chicken and Other Birds is published this Friday by Quadrille, priced \u00a320."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
