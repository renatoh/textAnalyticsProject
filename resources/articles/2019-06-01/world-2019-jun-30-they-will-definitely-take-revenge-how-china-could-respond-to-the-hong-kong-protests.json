Mao Zedong in 1930 famously used the traditional saying: \u201ca single spark can start a prairie fire\u201d to remind fellow Communists the power of strikes and uprisings when they were a fledgling opposition party under the one-party Nationalist rule. Today, Chinese leaders are likely to take a much grimmer view when they see images of millions protesting a controversial law in Hong Kong this month. Rocked by its biggest political crisis in decades, millions have thronged to the streets to protest a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told reporters last week that it was \u201chighly alarming that Western forces have been stirring up trouble and provoking confrontation in an attempt to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s peace and stability.\u201d Casting protests as conspiracies fomented by \u201cWestern hostile forces\u201d is a narrative that is not new for the Chinese government. The 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement, eventually crushed by the military, was labelled as a plot backed by Western powers to topple communist rule. The 500,000-strong protest in Hong Kong against a proposed subversion law in 2003 and the 79-day \u201cUmbrella\u201d civil disobedience movement in 2014 were also similarly blamed on \u201cforeign forces\u201d set to undermine China. Amid the recent protests, a Hong Kong representative to the Chinese parliament warned of \u201cforeign forces\u2019 interference\u201d and warned people not to become \u201cpawns\u201d in the US-China trade war. \u201cAccording to the Communist ideology, \u2018We are the people\u2019s representatives\u2019, so the party cannot accept people rising up against it and forcing it to back down,\u201d said Joseph Cheng, retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong. The authorities also have a deep-rooted tendency to blame problems on foreign interference instead of their own governance weaknesses, political commentator and veteran journalist Ching Cheong said. \u201cChina sees Hong Kong as influenced by years of colonial rule and having no sense of responsibility to introduce laws to protect the national security or to help the country nab fugitives,\u201d said Ching. \u201cAnd they believe that hostile forces are using \u2018colour revolution\u2019 to subvert China through Hong Kong.\u201d Chinese leaders have many times warned against \u201ccolour revolution\u201d \u2013 movements that lead to regime changes through non-violent resistance \u2013 and Chinese President Xi Jinping in January warned officials to be vigilant against political risks that could threaten the Communist Party\u2019s rule. \u201cThe Communist Party fears mass protests,\u201d said Willy Lam, a China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who said Xi was particularly frightened of unpredictable events that could disturb the stats quo. After the current crisis, analysts believe the Hong Kong government will likely start a new round of retaliatory measures against its critics while the Chinese government will tighten its grip on the city. \u201cThey will definitely seek revenge, otherwise they can\u2019t justify themselves as an effectual regime,\u201d said Lam. Analysts expect that the Hong Kong government will widen the prosecution of people active in the protests. Last week, the police said 32 people had been arrested over the recent demonstrations and five have been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Analysts also expect the government to continue weakening the pro-democracy camp by disqualifying more of its election candidates. Six members of the legislature have already been ousted and candidates seen as pro-independent have been prevented from running for public office. And Beijing will likely try to assume more power over Hong Kong, speed up its integration with China, and intensify ideological education, analysts say. \u201cChina will step up its intervention. Like after the 2003 protest, China will watch more closely,\u201d said Cheng. At China\u2019s behest, Hong Kong has already put in place a number of infrastructure projects that aid integration with the mainland, such as a bridge linking Hong Kong, Macau and Southern China\u2019s Greater Bay Area, and a multi-billion-dollar high-speed rail linking the city and mainland cities. And more resources will likely be dedicated to initiatives to fuel patriotism, such as stepping up ideological education among youngsters, analysts say. Having antagonised not only the pro-democracy camp, but also the business community and even pro-government politicians in the recent crisis, Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam will lean even more heavily on her Beijing masters for support, Cheng said. \u201cShe will get even closer to China,\u201d he said. But in the absence of any real solution to address Hong Kong people\u2019s plights for democracy and more freedoms, these strategies will only deepen Hong Kong\u2019s political crisis and more angry outbursts of discontent are expected on the streets. \u201cThe crux of the issue is that there is no democracy and there are no checks and balances so bigger mistakes will occur,\u201d warned Cheng. \u201cConflicts will keep accumulating and one day these will explode.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
