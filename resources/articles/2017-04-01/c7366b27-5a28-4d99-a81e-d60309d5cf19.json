Within minutes of confirmation that the Champions League quarter-final first leg will be replayed on Wednesday night, the Bundesliga club sent out a tweet informing Monaco supporters that a scheme to house them for the night was already under way. That was followed soon after by an offer from the Ligue 1 side to subsidise their fans up to \u20ac80 (\u00a368) to stay in local hotels before the rearranged game, which will kick off at 5.45pm UK time. Several supporters heeded the rallying call, with some posting pictures of the two groups of fans enjoying a meal together. \u201cIf someone still needs a place to sleep for tonight in Dortmund, don\u2019t hesitate to contact me,\u201d wrote journalist Thomas Thiel. \u201c#bedforawayfans and #tableforawayfans are all hungry,\u201d added Twitter user @vespafoto. Earlier, police had praised the reactions of supporters inside the Westfalenstadion for their calm reaction to being evacuated. \u201cBig kudos to all stadium visitors. Almost all have left the stadium without any problems and are on the way home,\u201d read a tweet from the local police account. Dortmund\u2019s chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke, added: \u201cI have to express a huge compliment to our fans, who have dealt with it very well, objectively, reasonably and solidly.\u201d Despite police revealing they had discovered a letter near the scene of the crime which contained a claim of responsibility for the attack, the Dortmund president, Reinhard Rauball, backed the club\u2019s players to put the episode behind them and concentrate on their meeting with the side who beat Manchester City in the last 16. \u201cOf course this is an extremely difficult situation for the players,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they are professionals and I am convinced that they will put that away and will bring their performance tomorrow. It would be a bad thing for those who did that to succeed, because the team is influenced in some way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
