Sir Kevin Tebbit, giving evidence at the final hearing of the two-month-old Hutton inquiry, also denied ever telling Tony Blair's former communications director, Alastair Campbell, that Dr Kelly was \"a bit of a show-off\". Closing the hearings this afternoon Lord Hutton revealed that his report would probably not be ready until the New Year - not late November, as previously expected. He said that due to the sheer weight of evidence to consider, and the practicalities of the \"printing process\", he still hoped to deliver his report in December, but it may in fact not be ready until January. Returning to give evidence for the final time - after an eye operation delayed his initial return - Sir Kevin was cross-examined by QCs for the Ministry of Defence, the Kelly family and the inquiry itself, and insisted that Dr Kelly had consented to his name becoming public, even if that consent was only \"tantamount\" or \"implicit\". Asked if Dr Kelly was informed of the strengthening up of the Q&amp;A material which had eventually led to his name being confirmed by the MoD, Sir Kevin said \"not in explicit terms but I believed it was implicit\". Earlier he admitted to Jeremy Gompertz, the lawyer for Dr Kelly's widow and daughters, that the weapons expert's consent had been \"tantamount\" because he had approved of Richard Hatfield's reading-out of the initial press statement and understood that the matter would need further media handling. Dinner party 'slur' Earlier, Sir Kevin was forced to answer dramatic accusations from Mr Gompertz that he had told the BBC's diplomatic correspondent, James Robins, that Dr Kelly was \"a bit eccentric\" and having made a circular motion to his head with his forefinger. The alleged conversation, referred to in an email from Mr Robins to the BBC head of news, Richard Sambrook was supposed to have taken place at a lecture and dinner party at the Italian ambassador's house on July 16 - the day before Dr Kelly's apparent suicide. Mr Robins wrote to his boss that Sir Kevin \"sought me out to have a few words in confidence\" although he was \"not quite sure what the purpose of this particular little smear is\". But Sir Kevin insisted that if he had in fact spoken to Mr Robins at the buffet table, it was only to say that \"anyone who talks to Andrew Gilligan must be 'off their head'\". Sir Kevin insisted his remarks were not intended as a smear merely that \"anyone who talks to Andrew Gilligan in these circumstances must be a bit odd\". Campbell diaries dismissed as 'racy' Sir Kevin was also forced to deny the accuracy of two diary entries by Alastair Campbell. The first of which had reported Sir Kevin as saying: \"The guy [David Kelly] never mentioned me [Alastair Campbell] - he was a bit of a show-off though.\" Sir Kevin responded that he could not answer for Mr Campbell's diaries but that he \"certainly wouldn't say that\". He admitted, however, that he may have described Dr Kelly to Mr Campbell as \"someone who enjoyed talking to journalists\". Sir Kevin dismissed Mr Campbell's diaries as having a \"racy style\"; he also rejected their claim that he had been consulted over a proposal to leak Dr Kelly's name to the press. Mr Campbell's diaries - already read out to the court in earlier hearings - mooted a plan to give Dr Kelly's name to the papers ahead of the prime minister's appearance before the parliamentary liaison committee, but that \"they [Sir Kevin Tebbit and Sir David Omand] didn't want to do it.\" Sir Kevin agreed that hypothetically he would not have wanted to do it but said he had never been informed or consulted about it in any case. No guarantee of anonymity Answering questions from James Dingemans, QC for the inquiry, Sir Kevin said of the evolving Q&amp;A briefing material that despite the testimony of Dr Kelly's widow \"there was never an understanding of anonymity and we could not have given it\". Sir Kevin elaborated: \"There was not a specific understanding. I thought it was understood.\" Sir Kevin told Mr Gompertz that Dr Kelly was \"rather dismissive\" of offers of help, and quoted Mrs Kelly as saying her husband was \"sometimes a difficult person to help\". Conduct of MoD Questioned by his own counsel, David Lloyd-Jones for the MoD, Sir Kevin subtly attempted to shift the blame away from his department. First of all he implied that Dr Kelly should have had a self-interest in outing himself \"so he himself would have an interest in removing this slur from him\". That referred to some of the accusations made by Mr Gilligan in his Today programme report, which Dr Kelly was not believed to have agreed with. Secondly with reference to Dr Kelly's apparent suicide, Sir Kevin said that the department had had \"no knowledge of Flint, Hewitt, Watt [other journalists Dr Kelly had spoken to in the past] and so we had no idea of the pressure he may have been under.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
