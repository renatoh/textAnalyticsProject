He made personal remarks about his experiences with racism while speaking at a local community college. \u201cI am the attorney general of the United States. But I am also a black man,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI can remember being stopped on the New Jersey turnpike on two occasions and accused of speeding.\u201d \u2022 A police officer who threatened protesters was relieved of duty on Wednesday. While monitoring the protests, he had aimed an assault rifle at protesters and threatened to kill them.

Follow the Guardian\u2019s Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72), and Chris McGreal (@ChrisMcGreal) for ongoing reporting from Ferguson. More from Eric Holder\u2019s meeting at a community college in Ferguson: I think about my time in Georgetown \u2013 a nice neighborhood of Washington \u2013 and I am running to a picture movie at about 8 o\u2019clock at night. I am running with my cousin. Police car comes driving up, flashes his lights, yells \u2018where you going? Hold it!\u2019 I say \u201cWoah, I\u2019m going to a movie.\u201d Now my cousin started mouthing off. I\u2019m like, \u2018This is not where we want to go. Keep quiet.\u2019 I\u2019m angry and upset. We negotiate the whole thing and we walk to our movie. At the time that he stopped me, I was a federal prosecutor. I wasn\u2019t a kid. I was a federal prosecutor. I worked at the United States Department of Justice. So I\u2019ve confronted this myself. We are starting here a good dialogue. But the reality is the dialogue is not enough. We need concrete action to change things in this country. That\u2019s what I have been trying to do. That\u2019s what the President has been trying to do. We have a very active civil rights division. I am proud of what these men and women have done. As they write about the legacy of the Obama administration, a lot of it is going to be about what the civil rights division has done. So this interaction must occur. This dialogue is important. But it can\u2019t simply be that we have a conversation that begins based on what happens on August 9, and ends sometime in December, and nothing happens. As I was just telling these young people, change is possible. The same kid who got stopped on the New Jersey freeway is no the attorney general of the United States. This country is capable of change. But change doesn\u2019t happen by itself. So let\u2019s here. Let\u2019s do the work today. Excerpts from attorney general Eric Holder\u2019s meeting at St Louis Community College Florissant Valley have been released. He spoke personally about his experience with racism and the nation\u2019s history of racism. \u201cThis is something that has a history to it and the history simmers beneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson,\u201d Holder said. I just had the opportunity to sit down with some wonderful young people and to hear them talk about the mistrust they have at a young age. These are young people and already they are concerned about potential interactions they might have with the police. I understand that mistrust. I am the attorney general of the United States. But I am also a black man. I can remember being stopped on the New Jersey turnpike on two occasions and accused of speeding. Pulled over \u2026. \u2018Let me search your car\u2019 \u2026 Go through the trunk of my car, look under the seats and all this kind of stuff. I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me. via @chrisgeidner Missouri state highway patrol has relieved an officer of duty and suspended him indefinitely after he threatened a group of demonstrators during protests, St Louis County police said on Wednesday. \u201cThe unified command strongly feel these actions are inappropriate, and not indicative of the officers who have worked daily, to keep the peace,\u201d St Louis county police said in a statement. The ACLU of Missouri said in a letter to highway patrol that the officer, a member of the St Ann police force, \u201cpointed an assault weapon at civilians and threatened to kill them\u201d and then invited them to \u201cfuck themselves,\u201d The city of Ferguson\u2019s police department clarified that it is not part of the enforcement efforts in the common protest zone on West Florissant Avenue, an area which is being enforced by state highway patrol and St Louis County police. \u201cThe Ferguson police department does not have the military style equipment referred to in many media reports describing use of force in managing violence during recent unrest, including armored tanks, tear gas and \u2018riot gear,\u2019\u201d the agency said in a release titled \u201cimportant factual correction regarding militarization of local police.\u201d \u201cThe public perception seems to be that our officers are engaged with protesters when they are not,\u201d said mayor James Knowles in the statement. \u201cOur officers are working in the rest of Ferguson providing community policing support to our residents and businesses.\u201d via @aterkel St Louis alderman Antonio French, who has become one of the best known faces of these demonstrations, spoke to the St Louis Dispatch-Post about \u201coutside agitators\u201d effect on the protests. French says the numbers may show that the majority of those provoking the situation are local, but out-of-town antagonists are exacerbating the tension. \u201cWe had two guys last night from Chicago, one of them who calls himself Joey, who was set on getting people worked up,\u201d said French, who has worked incessantly as a mediator between police and demonstrators. French at the same time concedes that some of the agitation is coming from \u201cthose Canfield boys,\u201d referring to the apartment complex where Brown lived. But he maintains that the violence over the past several days attracts nonresidents. \u201cSome people think that the revolution is starting now, and they want to be here,\u201d the alderman said. St Louis county prosecutor Bob McCulloch challenged Missouri governor Jay Nixon about whether or not he will remain as prosecutor on the Michael Brown shooting case, in a radio interview broadcast on KMOX St Louis. \u201cStep up and say I\u2019m on the case or off the case,\u201d McCulloch said. McCulloch\u2019s impartiality has been questioned by some who are concerned about his deep dies to local law enforcement. He\u2019s defended his ability to fairly judge the case, but that did not assuage the concerns of a small group of protesters that gathered outside the Justice Center building in Clayton, Missouri where the grand jury meets. \u201cWith so many people who saw so many things, I\u2019m very confident we\u2019ll have an excellent understanding of what happened out there that day,\u201d McCulloch said. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine recounts the past 11 days of protest in Ferguson, which have shattered any illusions of racial harmony in Barack Obama\u2019s United States. Before the apocalyptic scenes of troops, teargas and \u201cless lethal\u201d bullets turned this town of just 21,000 into an international spectacle, a man who gave his name as HB quietly sprinkled Remy Martin cognac on the spot on the residential side road where his young friend Michael Brown had been shot dead on 9 August. Six bullets from a policeman\u2019s pistol meant that Brown, who was 18, would never grow old enough to drink his favourite brandy in a bar. \u201cWe are in so much pain,\u201d HB told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to tear shit up. And it ain\u2019t going to stop until we get some kind of justice. We need to stop these white cops.\u201d His threat might have been easily dismissed that sunny afternoon as the idle talk of the grieving and vengeful. But more than a week later, just about the only thing clear through the fog of noxious gas clouding Ferguson\u2019s streets is the burning, implacable rage of Brown\u2019s peers against the police and their political masters in this northern suburb of St Louis. Though the start of classes in the Ferguson-Florissant school district has been delayed because of the protests, McCluer High football coach Mario MacDonald is having his players practice because of a Missouri state rule that says teams must practice for 14 days before their first game, which is Friday. Sports Illustrated\u2019s Robert Klemko spoke with the team about what the demonstrations mean to them and their community. A few days earlier, MacDonald had asked his players if they knew who the Black Panthers were and saw mostly blank faces. Instead of practicing one day, he showed them the civil rights documentary Eyes on the Prize and discussed the different factions of the movement. Meanwhile, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon mulled imposing a curfew in Ferguson and calling in the National Guard. \u201cMichael Brown,\u201d the coach told the team, \u201ccould have been one of you guys.\u201d Now, on Monday in a public park five miles from the spot where Michael Brown was shot to death, coach MacDonald is asking them to fix the center-quarterback exchange. St Louis metropolitan police are trained that a knife is a lethal weapon within 21 feet, said police chief Sam Dotson at a press conference on Wednesday. Though witnesses reported that Powell had two knives, Dotson said only one was recovered from the scene. It was similar to a steak knife, he said. Each officer fired six rounds, but investigators do not know how many times Powell was hit because autopsy results are not yet available. The shooting is being investigated by criminal and internal affairs. Both officers involved in Tuesday\u2019s shooting are on administrative leave and the agency is reviewing whether it is safe to release their names. The quick and clear release of information about this shooting starkly contrasts that of the Michael Brown shooting. Dotson said reporters will be provided with video and phone recordings from yesterday\u2019s shooting. St Louis metropolitan police have released an incident summary on Tuesday\u2019s officer-involved shooting. Kajieme Powell, a 25-year-old black male, was fatally shot by two unidentified police officers on Tuesday. One officer is 25-years-old and has served on the force for just over three years. The other is 31-years-old and has been on the force for just over two years. According to the incident summary, an alderwoman contacted the police and said that Powell had one knife in his hand and one knife in his pocket. Once officers were sent to the scene, \u201cthey observed the suspect acting erratically, walking back and forth down the street.\u201d When the two officers exited their police vehicle, Powell approached them saying \u201cshoot me now, kill me now.\u201d Officers asked him to stop and drop the knife multiple times, but the suspect continued walking toward them and both fired their weapons. Powell was pronounced dead on the scene. Attorney general Eric Holder met with Missouri state highway patrol captain Ron Johnson, who has been leading law enforcement\u2019s response to the protests. As a grand jury convenes for the first time on the shooting of Michael Brown, the St Louis Post-Dispatch has provided a rigorous explanation of how a grand jury works in St Louis County: Defense lawyers often view the grand jury as a rubber stamp of the prosecutor. The old saying about a grand jury could indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor wants is actually believed to have originated with a former New York court of appeals judge, Solomon Wachtler. He was telling a reporter about the influence prosecutors had over grand juries. \u201cIt\u2019s no joke,\u201d said James Cohen, an associate professor at Fordham University School of Law in New York. \u201cThat (quote) vividly places the power of the prosecutor in context.\u201d Cohen explains: \u201cThe prosecutor is responsible for presenting the evidence, calling the witnesses and instructors the jurors on the applicable law. The prosecutor can decide who to call based on what he expects the witnesses to say.\u201d The prosecutor can decide not to instruct the grand jury on a charge of murder, for instance, and instead only instruct the jury on criminal negligence. Or the prosecutor could instruct the grand jury on several charges, including manslaughter. The Guardian\u2019s correspondents in Ferguson report on the \u201ctussle\u201d between St Louis county prosecutor Bob McCulloch and Missouri governor Jay Nixon: McCulloch, whose impartiality has been repeatedly called into question, threw down what amounted to a challenge to Nixon, saying that he would recuse himself from the inquiry if the governor demanded he do. Nixon responded by saying that he would not make such a demand. But in a late-night statement on Tuesday that stopped well short of a ringing endorsement, the governor reiterated that McCulloch could step down if he wished. \u201cThere is a well-established process by which a prosecutor can recuse themselves from a pending investigation and a special prosecutor be appointed,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cDeparting from this established process could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution.\u201d The St Louis investigation has been clouded by the pressure on McCulloch, who has deep ties to law enforcement agencies. His impartiality was called into question when he criticised the decision by Nixon last week to remove the responsibility for policing the protests against the killing of Brown from the St Louis County police force. Here\u2019s the pool report on Eric Holder\u2019s meeting at Florissant Valley Community College: Among the handful of students who met with Holder was Molyrik Welch, 27, who said her brother died following an encounter with Ferguson police in 2011. Welch said the 31-year-old man, Jason Moore, died of cardiac arrest after officers allegedly used a stun gun during a disturbance call. \u201cA lot has happened here,\u201d she said. \u201cHe [Holder] promised things were going to change.\u201d Bro Ehsan, 25, a criminal justice student, said the recent Ferguson shooting and its aftermath had been a \u201csad experience.\u201d \u201cWe want to be part of change,\u201d Ehsan said. \u201cThis kind of thing should not be happening here.\u201d via @stlpublicradio US attorney general Eric Holder has just left Florissant Valley Community College, where he met with students. He\u2019s now headed to a meeting with community leaders, per reports from local media. Former Marine Lyle Jeremy Rubin cataloged the equipment police have deployed on the streets of Ferguson and how they are used, including stun grenades, gas canisters and armored vehicles. His explanations on the use and effects of wooden projectiles and more can be read on The Nation. Again, the wounds are nasty. All these injuries remind me of the after-affects of Simunition training for Marine officers at The Basic School, except worse. Like the stun grenade, employing wooden pellets as a form of riot control was spearheaded by the British decades ago, mainly in Hong Kong. As the ACLU makes clear, considerable litigation has proceeded in the aftermath of such tactics, including suits brought by protesters in Oakland who bore the brunt of these measures around the beginning of the Iraq War. Longshoremen on their way to work also suffered and sued accordingly. As a result, the Oakland police department caved and beating residents with wooden projectiles as a means of crowd management was rendered illegal. White house aides told the Washington Post that President Barack Obama, Eric Holder and Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett briefed 1,000 African American community leaders about the situation in Ferguson as part of an effort to \u201chelp keep the situation calm and focused.\u201d More from The Post on the White House\u2019s behind-the-scenes work on the protests: NAACP President Cornell William Brooks, who has been in frequent touch with the White House, said that \u201chaving the attorney general visit the site of an ongoing investigation is extra rare. . . . The U.S. government\u2019s pursuit of justice for this family is huge.\u201d The civil rights groups said they would continue to press the Obama administration to implement broader reforms aimed at ending racial profiling among law enforcement officers and scaling back the militarization of local police forces. \u201cIt\u2019s really tremendously important that the attorney general is making the trip tomorrow,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union. But she added that there is concern that once the media moment passes in Ferguson, the Justice Department might feel \u201cless of a sense of urgency.\u201d Here\u2019s where things stands as we continue to provide coverage on the demonstrations in Ferguson. \u2022 US attorney general Eric Holder has arrived in Ferguson, where he will meet with Department of Justice employees and community leaders for a briefing on the federal investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown. It\u2019s unusual for federal officials to become this involved in this type of a case and is causing tension between investigators on each side. \u2022 A grand jury has convened in Clayton, Missouri where prosecutor Bob McCulloch will present evidence on the shooting. McCulloch said this process could last into mid-October in interviews on Wednesday. \u2022 Some have raised questions about McCulloch\u2019s involvement in the case because of his deep ties to law enforcement. A small group of demonstrators assembled outside the Clayton Justice building ahead of the hearings to protest his involvement in the case. \u2022 Conversations with federal officials and a review of federal documents show that size and scope of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s program to provide military equipment to police eclipses that of the military equipment grant program operated by the Department of Justice. \u2022 A day after the city of Ferguson announced it would work to hire more black police officers and increase law enforcement transparency, mayor James Knowles spoke about the difficulties of accomplishing these things. Knowles has largely remained quiet during the protests. Tensions in Ferguson won\u2019t subside anytime soon says Slate\u2019s Jamelle Bouie, who has been reporting from Ferguson, where he says everyone has a story about their interactions with the police. What\u2019s important to understand is that these incidents and interactions reflect upon themselves. \u201cToo often the policeman\u2019s club is the only instrument of the law with which the Negro comes into contact,\u201d wrote Howard University criminologist Kelly Miller in a 1935 op-ed. \u201cThis engenders in him a distrust and resentful attitude toward all public authorities and law officers.\u201d If you\u2019re trying to grasp the looting that has struck Ferguson throughout the demonstrations, there\u2019s some of your answer. For as much as there are bad apples and provocateurs in any mass gathering, it\u2019s also true that there\u2019s a deep distrust of law enforcement across the black community that stems from decades of unfair treatment. \u201cThat\u2019s our life. We black. We get pulled over everyday,\u201d said two young demonstrators who declined to give their names, but were adamant\u2014as chants of \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d filled the air\u2014that they were \u201cout here for Michael Brown\u201d and \u201cthey would do it however they [the police] wanted to do it.\u201d Guardian reporters Rory Carroll and Chris McGreal have been reporting on the scene in Ferguson. Here\u2019s a round up of their photos from Tuesday. Last night\u2019s protests were more peaceful than other nights, but they were not absent confrontations between police and demonstrators. Activist Rosa Clemente says she and a group of protesters were harassed by police. Clemente shared her experience in an essay in Ebony: Let me be clear: we did nothing to provoke this. The first hour we were there, we merely walked and talked to folks--people were moving as they were told they had to and chanting. I caught up with Amy Goodman of NPR, and Trymaine [Lee]. Right before that, I had talked to clergy members. As a prayer vigil came together, I observed that the police seemed to get very agitated because people were being still. I stood watch. Talib and Jessica [Care Moore] were in a circle with young people who began to notice who they were and it seems that there was going to be an impromptu cipher. I kept my eye on the crew we were with; the amount of police officers was just as many as protestors. As a long time activist against police brutality I have been trained by elders and my organization Malcolm X Grassroots Movement to be alert, stay focused. So I was keenly aware when something shift. I stepped to Talib [Kweli] and said, \u201cSomething is about to go down.\u201d I saw the police raising their batons and getting into formation. As I wrapped up a convo with Trymaine, we saw a plastic water bottle being thrown. People kind of looked up, turned back to what they were doing...and the next thing you know, the police came at us like charging bulls, weapons drawn, screaming, causing mass confusion. There is no database of police shootings in the US, so Deadspin is trying to create one to overcome the information gap. Its asking for help from the public and is open to suggestions on better ways to compile the data. Deadspin explains: \u201cThere is no central infrastructure for handling that information and making it public. Researchers, confronted with the reality that there are over 17,000 law enforcement agencies in the country, aren\u2019t even sure how you\u2019d go about setting one up. No one is keeping track of how many American citizens are shot by their police. This is crazy. This is governmental malpractice on a national scale. We\u2019d like your help in changing this.\u201d Local news channel Fox2Now has a camera trained on US attorney general Eric Holder and his entourage, which have both made it to Missouri. Economic injustices and inequality institutionalized racist attitudes, says The Guardian\u2019s financial columnist Suzanne McGee . She broke down the economic inequalities black people in the US face: According to the 2012 US census, African Americans represent 14.2% of the population nationwide, but 28.1% of this group lives in poverty \u2013 compared to 11.1% of the total population. Of families with children, that number jumps to a third, compared to 18.8% of families of all races. Unemployment, whether short or long-term, runs at double the rate that white workers experience. If you\u2019re black, you\u2019re significantly more likely to have to spend more than 30% of your monthly income on either rent or monthly occupancy costs. What all this adds up to, in the long run, is a crippling disadvantage \u2013 a yawning wealth gap between the races. One study shows that while a white family turns every $1 of income into $5 of wealth, for the typical African American family that $1 translates into a mere 69 cents of wealth. White Americans make up 64% of the country\u2019s population, but own 88% of its wealth; today\u2019s typical white household is likely to be 20 times more affluent than its black counterpart. As long as that remains the case, the white economic elite perpetuates itself, and continues to make the rules \u2013 deciding, for instance, what the criteria are for hiring cops in Ferguson. Ferguson city leadership has been fairly quiet during the protests, but on Tuesday, the city of Ferguson called for \u201cnighttime quiet and reconciliation\u201d in a document that also promised that the city would work to increase diversity in its police force and to acquire dash cameras and vest cameras for police officers. Mayor James Knowles discussed these initiatives with the St Louis Post-Dispatch in an interview published today. \u201cWe don\u2019t hire a new cop every year,\u201d Knowles said. \u201cEvery time we do, we are rushing out there to find an African-American officer. It\u2019s a problem that we\u2019re committed to working with others to fix.\u201d He said that part of the problem is that the pool of black officer candidates is low and that other larger departments have recruitment advantages because they can pay more and offer more job growth. Missouri politicians are meeting with US attorney general Eric Holder today during briefings on the situation in Ferguson. This includes representative Emanuel Cleaver and state senator Claire McCaskill, who updated Holder on the situation last week in a phone call she made from a tire store. A petition for a proposed \u201cMike Brown Law\u201d has reached the signature threshold needed to get a response from the White House on the online open government initiative We The People. Anyone can create a petition on the website, but only petitions that get at least 100,000 signatures will receive a response from the administration. More than 127,000 people have signed the petition, which calls on lawmakers to create a bill that would require law enforcement to wear cameras. The request states: \u201cCreate a bill, sign into law, and set aside funds to require all state, county, and local police, to wear a camera.The law shall be made in an effort to not only deter police misconduct(i.e. brutality, profiling, abuse of power), but to ensure that all police are following procedure, and to remove all question, from normally questionable police encounters. As well, as help to hold all parties within a police investigation, accountable for their actions.\u201d Rebecca Carroll says in an editorial for The Guardian that white people need to use their privilege to dismantle racism: You are the ones who created this godforsaken racist system by using your circumstantial power and privilege 400 years ago to institutionalize white supremacy. Now use that power and privilege you still have, 400 years later, to dismantle it. And please don\u2019t quibble about whether you have any direct lineage to the architects of racism. You are benefitting from it, so you have a direct responsibility to figure out how to undo it. Because maybe you\u2019ve seen what happens when we black people try to undo it in 2014 \u2013 they call in the National Guard. In between talking with my son to both protect him from the same fate as Michael Brown and empower him to walk tall in his skin, I have tweeted and posted on Facebook about this all week to no avail. Some white friends and acquaintances have said their silence is not complicity, or that we all need to work together. More pointedly, it was suggested in one thread comment that my upbringing \u2013 adopted by two white parents and raised in a majority white town \u2013 imparts a certain privilege that does not allow me to truly understand the racism toward black people in places like Ferguson. It is unusual for an US attorney general to push for a federal investigation into a case like the Michael Brown shooting, but Eric Holder\u2019s aggressive efforts are indicative of a strong personal interest in the case, says the LA Times. Holder is the country\u2019s first African American attorney general and has become known for his involvement in civil rights cases since taking office in 2009. However, federal involvement in local cases tends to cause tense competition, and it looks like this situation is no exception. Holder is betting that federal action will quiet the nightly violence, according to one Justice Department official, who spoke anonymously because of the delicacy of the situation in Ferguson and at the department. \u201cHe believes maybe showing the flag will help quell the tension,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe attorney general has always been about race, and it happens here that the victim is black and the police officer is white. Yet one wonders how much that is playing a part in his extraordinary decision to go ahead with this.\u201d Another official, also speaking anonymously, said the situation could reach a tipping point where federal criminal charges would be the only way to vindicate Holder\u2019s public comments and show that the federal government is serious. \u201cHe sees a duty to prosecute or look into potential civil rights violations,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But once you\u2019re all in, you\u2019re all in.\u201d A small group of protesters have gathered outside the Justice Center in Clayton, Missouri, where the grand jury is meeting today. Images of armored military vehicles on the streets of Ferguson have inspired renewed criticism of a Department of Defense program that gives excess military surplus to local law enforcement, but The Guardian\u2019s Spencer Ackerman says that is eclipsed by the size and scope of a Department of Homeland Security program. During the current fiscal year, DHS plans to award $1.6bn in grant money for state, local and tribal agencies, mostly to aid them with counterterrorism, border security and disaster preparedness, it announced last month. By contrast, the Defense Department\u2019s \u201c1033\u201d program to transfer surplus military gear gave out less than $500m worth of equipment in fiscal 2013. Two grant programs in particular, awarded through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), provide the lion\u2019s share of the DHS money: the State Homeland Security Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative. The former program provides federal dollars to states, while the latter funds cities and metro areas directly. The State Homeland Security Program will disburse over $401m this year for \u201cplanning, organization, equipment, training and exercise needs\u201d relevant to preventing and responding to \u201cacts of terrorism and other catastrophic events\u201d. A grand jury for the Michael Brown shooting case is convening for the first time today, but St Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could take two months for his office to present all of its evidence. \u201cOur target date is hopefully by the middle of October,\u201d McCulloch said in a Wednesday morning radio interview. Some have questioned McCulloch impartiality in the case because of his past comments and close ties to local law enforcement. Last week, he criticized Missouri governor Jay Nixon for taking the duty of policing protests from the St Louis County police force. He is also the son of a police officer who was killed in the line of duty by a black assailant and his mother and brother have careers in law enforcement. McCulloch, however, has said he has \u201cdone a very good job of being fair and impartial\u201d in his 23 years as a prosecutor. \u201cI want to do my job,\u201d McCulloch said. \u201cThe Brown family deserves that. The community deserves that.\u201d Protesters chant \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d in this video from the tenth straight night of protests in Ferguson. Focusing on people\u2019s resistance instead of police repression dehumanizes black life, says Nyle Fort, in an editorial for The Guardian: But that\u2019s the crux of white supremacist racial logic: the problem with black people is \u2026 well, black people \u2013 not mass incarceration and the deindustrialization of urban America, not educational inequality and generational poverty, not 400 years of slavery, lynchings, and Jim Crow. To be black in America is to be victimized and then made responsible for our victimization. We built this country. But, apparently, it is we who are lazy and dependent. We are bullied politically, socially and economically. But it is we who are called \u201cthugs\u201d. \u201cThere is never an excuse for violence against police,\u201d President Obama said. Yet there are endless excuses for state violence against black people. For mass incarceration, there\u2019s the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d. For poverty and unemployment, there\u2019s \u201ca culture of laziness\u201d and \u201cgovernment dependence\u201d. For the educational gap, there\u2019s the burden of \u201cacting white\u201d. For Eric Garner: \u201cloosies\u201d. And for Michael Brown, there are stolen cigarillos, jaywalking or anything the police can say to shift the narrative from their white supremacist practices to black \u201cghetto\u201d culture. The most recent overnight protests in Ferguson were relatively calm following several nights of chaotic demonstrations. \u201cThere were no gunshots, Molotov cocktails or tear-gas - a peaceful night by Ferguson standards,\u201d said Chris Campbell and The Guardian\u2019s Rory Carroll in their report on the protests. In the early hours of Wednesday, however, there were reports of glass bottles being thrown and altercations between the crowd and police. More from Campbell and Carroll: For most of the night a crowd several-hundred strong marched without incident under the gaze of police, who stayed further back than previous nights. By 11pm Antonio French, a local alderman, was upbeat. \u201cWe just want to get a few peaceful nights in a row to restore faith that people are getting back to normal,\u201d he said. French, who has joined the nightly marches, said police appeared to have caught agitator ringleaders the previous 24 hours. He himself had tackled one on Monday night. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him tonight,\u201d smiled the alderman. Some trouble broke out: plastic and glass bottles were thrown, including some with urine, according to police. Officers faced off against dozens of chanting youths and occasionally lunged into the crowd to seize individuals, spraying some with pepper gas. Welcome to our live coverage of the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, where unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was killed by police on 9 August. The shooting sparked raging protests in the 21,000 person town, but demonstrations were relatively subdued on Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning. US attorney general Eric Holder is due in Ferguson today to check on a federal investigation into the shooting that has put about 40 FBI employees and members of the Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights division on the ground to canvass residents and gather evidence on the case. \u201cWe understand the need for an independent investigation, and we hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson,\u201d Holder said in an editorial posted on the St Louis Post-Dispatch\u2019s website on Tuesday. Evidence for the local investigation into the shooting is due to be presented to a grand jury this morning. The panel will determine whether the policer officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson, should be charged. Some have questioned the impartiality of St Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch because of his close ties to local law enforcement. McCulloch said he would recuse himself from the case if governor Jay Nixon demands it. St Louis police are also expected to provide updates on the police\u2019s fatal shooting of another black man on Tuesday. The shooting further stoked racial tensions as protests continue in the region. Sam Dotson, the chief of St Louis\u2019s metropolitan police, said the man did not respond to orders to drop a knife and was within four feet of the officers when they shot him. We will continue to provide updates throughout the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
