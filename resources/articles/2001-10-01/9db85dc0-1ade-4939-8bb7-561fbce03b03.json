The inquiry, by the Norfolk area child protection committee (ACPC) - which took evidence from social workers and other professionals - said inter-agency coordination was \"ineffective\" and social workers had not acted with \"due urgency\". \"Staff of all agencies in Norfolk involved with Lauren Wright missed opportunities to make sense of and interpret Lauren Wright's circumstances in the light of her current and previous experiences,\" said the report. Lauren's father Craig Wright and stepmother Tracey were found guilty today of manslaughter and of wilfully neglecting Lauren. The girl died when her stepmother struck her stomach so violently that her digestive system collapsed. Postmortem tests showed the child had 60 bruises on her body, including marks made by hard objects, possibly a stick. Gillian Shephard, Conservative MP for Norfolk south-west, which covers the village of Welney, Norfolk, where Lauren was abused and killed, called for a full public inquiry into her death. Ms Shephard said: \"\"What happened to her happened in full view of those agencies that should have been responsible for her care and the public deserves to be told why.\" Norfolk social services department admitted it made serious mistakes and chances to save Lauren were missed. One social services manager has already left the department as a result of the case. David Wright, Norfolk's director of social services, admitted that his department had made \"wrong\" decisions, but argued this was a \"clear case of human error\" He also blamed a national recruitment shortage and the pressures faced by social workers. \"How can we protect vital workers from becoming so battle-weary in dealing with these impossible situations that their judgment becomes impaired?\" Children's charity the NSPCC said the case was one of the most disturbing it had seen and lessons had to be learned. \"Social services, health and education professionals, and many relatives, neighbours and other villagers - saw the warning signs. Yet, despite their concerns, too little was done to protect [Lauren Wright].\" The ACPC inquiry found that coordination of the case by social services was ineffective and the opportunity to fully assess Lauren Wright's situation was \"weakened by not acting with due urgency on referrals or calling a child protection conference.\" Marian Brandon, a senior lecturer in social work at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, analysed all the evidence given to the child protection committee's inquiry and compiled an overview report. Her report says that at no time during the course of this case was consideration given to the convening of a multi-agency meeting. The report adds: \"There is no doubt that the social services department should have called a child protection conference in March 2000. \"At this time social services, health and education were becoming increasingly concerned that Lauren was failing to thrive and that she may have been experiencing abuse at home. \"The failure to convene a child protection conference at this stage was a crucial omission.\" The report made a series of recommendations - the main one being that professionals in any child care agency should challenge decisions that do not accord with their professional judgment. \"All responsible staff must on receipt of new information indicating child protection concerns ensure that it is dealt with urgently,\" added the report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
