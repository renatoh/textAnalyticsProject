Worries over the SFO bribery investigation encouraged traders to sell up, says David Madden of CMC Markets. While the case is hanging over the company, traders are likely to steer clear of the stock Glencore was the biggest blue-chip stock in London. Other multinationals also fell, as the surge in the pound will make their overseas earnings less valuable in sterling terms. This means the FTSE 100 has closed 50 points down at 7,137. Packaging firm DS Smith fell 7%, after warning that it faced a \u201cdifficult\u201d trading environment (although profits were still up 30%). The pound is on track to end the day at fresh highs. It\u2019s currently trading at a 31-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.185, and a seven-month high against the US dollar at $1.316. Economics professor Costas Milas has spotted something interesting about the pound (still trading at a seven-month high against the US dollar this afternoon). Web searches for Boris Johnson used to rise when the pound was becoming more volatile -- but currently, the reverse is true. He writes: You are pointing out that sterling hit 1.31 vs the dollar. What has arguably received less attention is the fact that financial markets (in addition to the Canadian Prime Minister) appear to have been\u201ctwo-faced \u201d. Academic research has already established that Google search activity predicts financial markets. The popularity of Boris Johnson (proxied by Google searches on the web) coincides with a surge in sterling\u2019s volatility from early 2016 up to and including the summer of 2019. That is, when Boris (first as a Foreign Secretary, then as a backbencher and then as a new Prime Minister) acted as the leading Brexiteer. Since the beginning of autumn, however, financial markets appear to have changed their mind. Indeed, as the prospect of a new general election together with the prospect of Boris Johnson winning next week\u2019s elections and \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d (despite the very tight deadline of December 2020) increased, the rise in Johnson\u2019s popularity appears to have reduced sterling\u2019s volatility... Shares in Glencore are on track to close at their lowest level since October 2016. The Resolution Foundation think tank have now issued a report into UK wealth, based on this morning\u2019s ONS data. Called \u201cWho owns all the pie?\u201d, it shows clearly how wealth inequality has risen in recent years, as the wealthiest people have benefitted most from higher asset prices. They also show that it\u2019s very hard to simply work your way to wealth, rather than inheriting it: Fifty years ago, someone with a good salary could save enough over the course of their lives to retire with a good amount of wealth to live off. For many people today this is a distant dream: what matters more is the wealth you inherit or marry in to, rather than the income you can set aside over a working lifetime. A middle income family on just over \u00a326,000, for example, would have to save everything for 96 years if they were to reach the wealth of a household in the top 10 per cent of the wealth distribution (whose average wealth is \u00a32.5 million). Even a family just inside the top tenth of the income distribution would have to save for 50 years, making it unrealistic that even the highest-paid can accumulate large amounts of wealth without windfalls from outside. Glencore (-7.4%) is helping to drag the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down. The blue-chip index has now lost 45 points, or 0.65% today, to 7142. That\u2019s also due to the stronger pound, which is weighing on exporters. Glencore, which is headquartered in Baar, Switzerland, is often described as the \u201cmost powerful company you\u2019ve never heard of\u201d. Valued at \u00a331bn, Glencore is the world\u2019s largest mining company by revenue, providing more zinc and cobalt than any other firms, and is also a huge trader of commodities such as oil. It was founded in 1974 as Marc Rich and Co. Rich \u2013 a former child refugee who became a naturalised American citizen after fleeing Nazi-occupied Belgium with his family. Here\u2019s more details: Back in 2017, the Paradise Papers investigation explained how Glencore had secretly loaned $45m to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, after enlisting him to secure a controversial mining agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We reported that: ..In 2009, Glencore loaned Gertler $45m with the caveat that it would be repayable if agreement with DRC authorities was not reached to secure a mining contract for a company linked to Glencore. Gertler\u2019s notoriety in the resource-rich but conflict-riven and corrupt DRC spans nearly two decades. He was cited by a 2001 UN investigation that said he had given the DRC president, Joseph Kabila, $20m to buy weapons to equip his army against rebel groups in exchange for a monopoly on the country\u2019s diamonds, and a 2013 Africa Progress Panel report said a string of mining deals struck by companies linked to him had deprived the country of more than $1.3bn in potential revenue. Gertler has firmly denied these allegations, and denies there was anything improper about the $45m loan. Here\u2019s the story: In January 2018, it emerged that the US Department of Justice was investigating allegations that Gertler has bribed top officials in the Congo to secure mining rights. The SFO\u2019s inquiry adds to Glencore\u2019s problems, says Bloomberg: The announcement worsens the legal troubles at the company, which is already being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible corruption and money-laundering in Venezuela, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo. NEWSFLASH: Mining and commodities giant Glencore is being probed by Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office. In a statement to the City, Glencore says: Glencore has been notified today that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has opened an investigation into suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business of the Glencore group. Glencore will co-operate with the SFO investigation. The SFO also released a brief statement, confirming it is looking into \u201csuspected bribery\u201d at Glencore. Following the announcement by Glencore PLC, the SFO confirms it is investigating suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business by the Glencore group of companies, its officials, employees, agents and associated persons. As this is a live investigation we cannot comment further. Shares in Glencore, which both produces raw materials and trades them around the globe, have promptly slumped by 6% in London. Eighteen months ago, Bloomberg reported that the SFO was concerned about Glencore\u2019s activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and its links to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler. Today\u2019s report also shows that poorer families are more likely to hold financial debt -- as they turn to hire-purchase schemes and credit cards to survive. The ONS says: The least wealthy 50% of households held 36% of total household debt in April 2016 to March 2018, but whilst they held less debt their total debt was a relatively large proportion of their total wealth, with less wealthy households being more likely to have financial debt. Richer households, though, are (obviously) more likely to hold substantial mortgage debt as this chart shows: Worryingly, UK household debt levels have also risen -- to \u00a31.28 trillion in 2016/18 \u2013 up 4% from 2014/16. More than 90% of that is linked to property assets (either mortgages or equity released schemes). But non-mortgage debt has jumped by 11% over the period, meaning the average household had \u00a39,400 of non-mortgage debt. This \u2018financial debt\u2019 has risen by \u00a312bn to \u00a3119bn, from \u00a3107 billion in April 2014 to March 2016. So while some families have become wealthier, others are more indebted. Some of this relates to student loans. But credit facilities, such as hire-purchase loans, have also swelled. The Office for National Statistics explains: Total household financial debt rose by \u00a312 billion (11%) in the latest period, up from \u00a3107 billion in April 2014 to March 2016, with most of the change accounted for by increased hire purchase debt (up by \u00a36 billion) and student loans from the Student Loans Company (up by \u00a37 billion). Some 12.7m households have some form of financial debt, up from 12.4m in 2014-16. Here\u2019s the details of Britons\u2019 debt burden: \u00a335 billion in non-student loans \u00a332 billion in student loans \u00a325 billion in hire purchase \u00a322 billion on credit and store cards \u00a33 billion in overdrafts \u00a31 billion in mail order debts \u00a31 billion in arrears on bills Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201c13 million of us are living in the red \u2013 lugging the burden of non-mortgage debts around with us. The figures are skewed slightly by the \u00a332 billion of student debts \u2013 which the vast majority of graduates will never pay back in full. However, even excluding that we\u2019re carrying \u00a387 billion in loans, credit cards, hire purchase agreements, overdrafts and arrears. It\u2019s an enormous burden of debt and interest to be facing each month, and it keeps rising \u2013 it\u2019s up 11% in the most recent figures. Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation has tweeted about the rise in UK wealth, and wealth inequality: There is also a remarkable divergence in wealth growth across the UK in the last decade. London has seen a huge jump in wealth, but the North East and the East Midlands have both suffered falling wealth. How has the average Londoner become so wealthy? Over to the ONS.... For London, median total wealth has increased in each of the survey periods since July 2006 to June 2008. Between July 2006 to June 2008 and April 2016 to March 2018, median total wealth in London has increased by 78% to \u00a3356,400. Changes in net property and pension wealth are the major factors driving changes to total wealth. For London, median net property wealth has increased by 51% since July 2006 to June 2008, to \u00a3410,000 in April 2016 to March 2018. Pension wealth has increased by 47% to \u00a3102,200. The ONS\u2019s wealth report also shows clearly that wealth inequality has risen in Britain over the last decade. The UK\u2019s Gini coefficient for total wealth, a widely-used measure, has risen from 61% in 2008 to 63%. That means wealth is distributed more unequally than before the financial crisis. On the Gini coefficient, a reading of zero shows totally equal distribution, while 100% shows a totally unequal sharing of the pie. So it\u2019s notable that the Gini coefficient for net financial wealth has risen to 91%, a level that screams inequality. The ONS explains: Some households may be in net financial debt (their debts exceed their assets), many will have relatively modest amounts in savings accounts, while others have many millions in financial investments. It\u2019s official: The wealthiest people in the UK are getting even wealthier. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that UK households grew their combined wealth by 13% between April 2016 and March 2018 (the most recent data). Much of that increase is due to rising asset prices -- which benefits the wealthiest as they tend to own them; either outright, or in their pension pots. Rising property prices have also boosted wealth (but again, that\u2019s only good news if you own your own home, or someone elses...) And that\u2019s why the wealthiest 10% of families got the biggest boost, while the poorest 10% saw little improvement. The ONS says: The total net wealth of private households in Great Britain was \u00a314.6 trillion in April 2016 to March 2018, an increase of 13% in real terms from April 2014 to March 2016, mainly because of increases in private pension and net property wealth. Median household net wealth in Great Britain in April 2016 to March 2018 was \u00a3286,600, an increase of 9% from April 2014 to March 2016, after adjusting for inflation. Total wealth inequality in Great Britain is broadly unchanged in the most recent period, though it has increased since July 2006 to June 2008, based on a number of measures of inequality. Inequality in net property wealth and net financial wealth has increased between July 2006 to June 2008 and April 2016 to March 2018, while inequality in pension wealth has fallen. Average (mean) wealth for all wealth deciles increased in real terms between April 2014 to March 2016 and April 2016 to March 2018, with the higher deciles seeing the biggest increases; the average for the poorest decile increased 3%, and the richest wealth decile increased by 11%. Richard Falkenh\u00e4ll, senior FX strategist at Nordic bank SEB, reckons sterling\u2019s recovery could be short-lived. He fears another cliff-edge Brexit crisis in a year\u2019s time following a Conservative victory, as it will be very hard to agree a new free trade deal quickly. Falkenh\u00e4ll writes: \u201cThe pound continues to gain on the back of opinion polls showing a stable lead for the Conservative party, and markets are now probably almost fully discounting a Tory majority in UK Parliament after the general election. \u201cWhile this would create some certainty around Brexit in the short term as the UK will then leave the withdrawal period and move into the transition period in January 2020, a Conservative win will in fact increase the risk of the UK falling out of the EU without a trade deal by the end of next year (2020). It might be that the GBP recovery could turn out to be quite short-lived.\u201d Earlier today, chancellor Sajid Javid said he was confident that the UK and EU could agree a future relationship before the end of the withdrawal agreement in December 2020. But there\u2019s considerable scepticism about this..... Sales of vans also fell sharply in the UK last month, suggesting businesses are hunkering down until the election is over. New van registrations slumped by 9.6% compared with November 2018, new figures show. That\u2019s the third monthly decline in a row. Registrations of small vans (below 2 tonnes) have tumbled by 24%, while large vans (2.5-3.5 tonnes) are down 11.4%. Pickup sales are up, though. The SMMT\u2019s Mike Hawes blames political uncertainty: \u201cA third consecutive month of decline for new van registrations is concerning, particularly after growth for much of the year. Ongoing political uncertainty doesn\u2019t help inspire business confidence but this is essential if we are to embolden further investment in new vehicles which will go a long way to improving air quality in our towns and cities.\u201d Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the latest general election latest - including some interesting defections from the Brexit party today: Willem Klijnstra, currency analyst at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, has told the Financial Times that a Johnson win next week is \u2018baked in\u2019 to the pound\u2019s current valuation. He says: A Tory-led government is baked in today. The tail risk is that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Klijnstra also points out that a Conservative win would take attention \u201cstraight back to Brexit\u201d -- both the withdrawal from the EU by 31 January and the trade talks. Trade experts doubt the government claim that it can agree a comprehensive deal by the end of 2020, so further tensions next year would weigh on UK assets. The pound has dipped a little since the UK car figures came out, but is still at a 31-month high against the euro at \u20ac1.184. That\u2019s its highest level since Theresa May held her ill-fated snap general election, when opinion polls predicted a solid Conservative win. Investors seem to believe the pollsters are doing a better job this time. As Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank told clients today: Sterling has been supported by investor hopes that a Conservative majority at the election will support a smooth ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament, taking away some of the short-term uncertainty over the Brexit process. The sole poll yesterday came last night and showed a 10pt lead for the Tories - unchanged from the previous poll and in-line with the poll of polls. Next week\u2019s general election hasn\u2019t helped the car industry, says Ian Plummer, commercial director at Auto Trader. Here\u2019s his take on the drop in car sales last month: \u201cManufacturers are coming up against unprecedented cost hurdles as they take the journey towards the electrification of their fleet and also fight to hit the stringent new CO2 emissions regulations next year. Some of the biggest industry stalwarts have recently announced job losses as they look to refocus their businesses to deal with these issues. Compounding that, issues caused by Brexit continue to hinder the industry too; the unsteady value of the pound, consumer uncertainty and the ambiguity around future trading regulations only serve to amplify the enormous pressure manufacturers are under. And in the short term, both the manufacturers and their franchised retailers, still have ambitious targets to meet to reach despite these wider economic challenges. \u201cBrexit, and now the election, is also further dampening consumer buying confidence, making it ever-harder to sell cars. Although electric car sales have risen steadily this year, they only make up a small proportion of the market. Nearly two-thirds of consumers are still plumping for a petrol engine, as this chart shows. That\u2019s why the SMMT are calling for cash incentives, and more electric charging point to encourage customers to switch. A survey earlier this year showed that electric cars are now more affordable than petrol in some countries, as lower taxes, fuel costs and subsidies makes up for a higher purchase price. But some consumers could be put off by the range provided by current models. MG\u2019s ZS EV (\u00a326,995), for example, promises a range of 163 miles on a single charge. Political uncertainty is deterring consumers from buying a new car, says Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive. He\u2019s also calling for more government support for electric cars. \u201cThese are challenging times for the UK new car market, with another fall in November reflecting the current climate of uncertainty. It\u2019s good news, however, to see registrations of electrified cars surging again, and 2020 will see manufacturers introduce plenty of new, exciting models to give buyers even more choice. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go for these vehicles to become mainstream and, to grow uptake further, we need fiscal incentives, investment in charging infrastructure and a more confident consumer.\u201d Newsflash: UK car sales have fallen again, led by yet another slump in diesel demand. Sales dropped 1.3% year-on-year in November, with 156,621 models registered. With just one month to go, car sales are down 2.7% this year compared with 2018. Diesel car sales slumped by 27% year-on-year, as the crackdown on polluting vehicles continues to deter consumers. Petrol rose by 2%. The figures also show that alternatively fuelled vehicles now have a record market share of 10.2%. That\u2019s hybrid, plug-in hybrid or pure electric cars. Reaction to follow.... Over in Germany, the factory slump continues to drag on. German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in October, by 0.4% month-on-month, new government data shows. That means orders are 5.5% lower than a year ago, as the ongoing US-China trade war and slowing global growth hits Europe\u2019s largest economy. The pound was the biggest mover in the foreign exchange market yesterday, as it rallied against other major currencies. With fresh gains this morning, forecasts of a Conservative win next week are lifting the currency, explains Lee Hardman of Japanese bank MUFG: With only a week to go until the UK election, the Tory party still hold a sizeable lead of around 10 percentage points over Labour. It has made market participants increasingly confident to price in a Tory majority and an end to the deadlock in parliament. Boris Johnson set out his agenda yesterday for the first 100 days of a Conservative government. He pledged that legislation to implement his EU withdrawal agreement will be put back before parliament ahead of Christmas as he aims to take the UK out of the EU by the end of January. There are also plans for a February budget which would quickly implement plans to begin raising the threshold for paying national insurance tax. With the pound increasingly pricing in a Tory election victory ahead of the event, there is some risk of \u201cbuy the rumour sell the fact\u201d price action following the announcement of the election result even if the Tories secure a majority as expected. Pound price action would be much more volatile if the opinion polls were to prove misleading. Currency expert Kit Juckes of Societe Generale writes: Sterling rallied on continued optimism about a Conservative win in the General Election and, as one wag put it, an absence of gaffes from Boris Johnson. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With a week to go until the general election, predictions of a Conservative victory are pushing the pound higher. Sterling has hit a fresh 31-month high against the euro this morning, touching \u20ac1.185 for the first time since May 2017. It\u2019s also continuing to climb against the US dollar, touching $1.314 - a seven-month high. Traders are increasingly confident that Boris Johnson will be returned to Downing Street, probably with a working majority that will allow him to push his Brexit deal through parliament by 31 January. The latest YouGov polling gives the Conservatives a nine-point lead, which could be enough to avoid Johnson\u2019s nightmare scenario of another hung parliament. Johnson will be relieved that the NATO summit passed off without Donald Trump wading into UK politics -- beyond denying that he has covetousness desires for the NHS. Overnight, the Conservatives have also wheeled out some pledges designed to woo voters next week, including a tax-cutting budget in February and a boost to education spending. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the pound\u2019s rally shows that the City is expecting an orderly Brexit early next year: The pound broke to the upside yesterday, as President Trump came and went while managing to avoid courting controversy over the NHS, and by virtue of that putting Boris Johnson in a difficult spot. As a result of that currency markets appear to be starting to price out the prospect that Labour might win a majority at next week\u2019s election. Having been so negative on the pound for so long, markets are starting to believe in the prospect that we could well start to see the prospect of an orderly withdrawal from the EU in the next two months, and thus short positions are starting to get squeezed out, sending the currency to its best levels against the euro since before the 2017 election. Also coming up today We find out how many new cars were bought in the UK last month - a poor reading could suggest consumers are cautions ahead of the general election. Oil ministers from the Opec cartel are meeting in Vienna today. They could agree output cuts in an attempt to push crude prices up. Financial markets are still nervous about the prospects of a US-China trade deal, following conflicting noises this week. The clock is ticking towards 15 December, when Washington could impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports.
