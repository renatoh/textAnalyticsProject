The report by Anne Longfield said hundreds of thousands of young people are off the radar of \u201cearly warning systems\u201d such as schools, putting them at heightened risk. It calls for the government to ensure that councils and teachers stay in touch with those most vulnerable to exploitation, and those suffering the \u201ctoxic trio\u201d of domestic violence, substance misuse and mental illness at home. The findings are part of a paper focusing on the deprivation endured by England\u2019s most vulnerable families \u201cWhile the government\u2019s decision to keep schools open for the most vulnerable children is welcome, sadly most of them are just not showing up,\u201d Longfield said. \u201cThey are most likely at home, often exposed to a cocktail of secondary risks \u2013 a lack of food in the house, sofa-surfing or cramped living conditions, neglect, or experiencing acute difficulties due to parental domestic violence, substance abuse and mental health problems. Many will be caring for parents or siblings themselves in these incredibly difficult circumstances.\u201d Longfield\u2019s report comes after the Department for Education\u2019s (DfE) own figures showed that just 5% of pupils identified as vulnerable were attending school in England. The Guardian reported that headteachers were making daily calls to pupils at home to make sure they were safe, along with continuing to provide meals and other support. The report said the lockdown has removed many of the usual ways of identifying children at risk, with schools and other community hubs, including doctors\u2019 surgeries, youth centres, children\u2019s centres and libraries also closed. Longfield said she wants to see schools working with local authorities to ensure that all children known to be vulnerable are still being seen by professionals. \u201cI applaud the efforts of some schools and councils to ensure vulnerable children are still being visited by teachers or social workers. I\u2019d like to see this extend throughout the country,\u201d she said. The report and data collected by the children\u2019s commissioner found huge variations among local authorities in different categories of deprivation and vulnerability throughout England. The DfE said local authorities were receiving additional funding of \u00a33.2bn to cope with pressures caused by the coronavirus lockdown, including in children\u2019s social care, and that it had set up teams around the country to improve its information on the risks facing vulnerable children. \u201cSchools and early years settings remain open for vulnerable children, who are encouraged to attend where it is appropriate for them to do so. We thank social workers and everyone involved in keeping these children safe at this time for their hard work, including continuing to conduct risk assessments and home visits where needed,\u201d the DfE said. But Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, said the government could not ignore Longfield\u2019s warnings of the heightened risks. \u201cYesterday, the government significantly relaxed statutory duties on local authorities to protect vulnerable children. In light of this report, it is even more urgent that the government guarantees these changes will not adversely impact children in need and commits to reversing them if there is any evidence they are doing so. \u201cMinisters must also alleviate the financial pressures on families which may be making the situation even worse, including ensuring urgent access to food where the free school meal voucher scheme is failing,\u201d Long-Bailey said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
