The journeymen Graeme Hogg, Clayton Blackmore and Chris Turner all wore the famous red jersey on that crisp November day in 1986 when the only talk of trebles concerned the drinking habits of some of the players the new manager had inherited. \"All sorts of things have changed in the last 16 years,\" Ferguson ventured yesterday, but perhaps Sir Bobby Charlton summed it up most eloquently. \"A magical manager,\" he said. \"Sir Matt Busby was great for this club, but Alex has been phenomenal.\" Unprecedented success has come United's way since Charlton and his fellow directors tempted Ferguson away from Aberdeen, so it was appropriate that one of the most famous players in the club's history was present in Old Trafford's Salford Suite as the most successful manager in English football offered the most revealing insight yet into his motives behind staying another three years. \"I think he realised he was just going to miss it too much,\" Charlton later confided. \"It's one thing going on holidays, watching horseracing and playing golf, but football is in his blood.\" Listening to Ferguson, the same sentiments came across. Indeed, it is beginning to seem mildly preposterous that he was considering retirement in the first place. If football is addictive, United's manager is a self-confessed junkie, helpless without his daily fix. \"There was a part of me that was filled with trepidation. Just knowing that I wouldn't have that 3pm on Saturday to look forward to every week, that would have been the hardest part,\" he said. \"To be sitting in the stand watching a team that I had been associated with for 16 years, I've had no experience of anything like that before and, if I'm being honest, I wasn't looking forward to it at all. I was worried about what I was going to do.\" So much so that Ferguson, 60, was unsure he could bear to be around as his successor settled in. \"I was planning to go away for a couple of months, take myself right away from everything and then come back in October and start watching the team then. But even that would have been extremely difficult. I just wasn't ready to ride away into the sunset and, as any player will tell you, this is a difficult club to leave. After a while it becomes ingrained in the fabric of your life.\" Now, he said, the \"show goes on\". Not quite business as usual but almost, and all at the club are delighted. As Peter Kenyon, United's chief executive, said: \"Perhaps the only people who are not happy are our competitors, but we can live with that.\" There will be the odd tweak here and there. \"The administration is a problem for me,\" revealed Ferguson. \"It can get very claustrophobic. When you open the office door in the morning and see that pile of paperwork on your desk it can wear you down. \"I look at it sometimes and feel myself getting depressed. So that's something we will look at. And I might take a day off every now and then, just to keep up my energy and freshness. Well, that's the plan, anyway.\" For now, though, this wonderfully enthused sexagenarian is occupied with reuniting United with the 17lb of silverware otherwise known as the European Cup. \"We're equipped to do it. This is more or less the same squad that won the treble in 1999. OK, Peter Schmeichel has gone but we've got the best goalkeeper in the world in Fabien Barthez. Jaap Stam has left but, again, Laurent Blanc has been fantastic. The competition in the Premiership is fiercer than ever but I think we will get better too. There is a great future for this club and I'm sure we can be successful again in Europe.\" Ferguson gives the credit for his change of mind to his wife Cathy - \"she said you should only retire when you're tired\" - and, come 2005, his employers may hope she intervenes again. Asked whether he might further extend his stay, Ferguson smiled. \"Who knows?\" Not all was sweetness and light at Old Trafford yesterday, however. United's attempts to persuade David Beckham to sign a new contract have reached their most critical point yet, with Kenyon indicating last night that they were unwilling to meet the player's financial demands. Though emphasising that the negotiations were \"positive and not confrontational\", Kenyon could not disguise his frustration that, more than a year since the talks started, Beckham had yet to commit himself to the club. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
