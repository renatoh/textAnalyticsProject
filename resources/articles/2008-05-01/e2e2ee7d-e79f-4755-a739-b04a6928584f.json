The US president arrives in Israel today to take part in its 60th anniversary celebrations, but he is expected to do little to advance the slow-moving peace negotiations with the Palestinians. With Lebanon the latest crisis in the region, Bush lambasted Hizbullah and its supporters for \"destabilising the country and turning against the Lebanese people\". \"The international community will not allow the Iranian and Syrian regimes, via their proxies, to return Lebanon to foreign domination and control,\" he said. Washington would help Fouad Siniora, the embattled Sunni Lebanese prime minister, by strengthening his armed forces as they step up patrols to restore order after a week of violence initiated by the Shia militia. \"It's probably the most practical way that we can get some help to him quickly,\" Bush told al-Arabiya TV. The destroyer USS Cole has been sent back to patrol the Lebanese coast to underline US support. Saudi Arabia, leading the pro-American conservative Sunni countries alarmed by Hizbullah, Iran's reach and the chaos in Iraq, warned there would be implications for Arab relations with Tehran. \"For Iran to back the coup that happened in Lebanon and support it will have an impact on its relations with all Arab countries,\" said the Saudi foreign minister Saud al-Faisal. On another front, Bush told Israeli journalists he still hoped \"to get something defined\" in terms of an Israeli-Palestinian agreement by the end of this year, the deadline set when he launched the Annapolis talks last November. But he was not coming to \"demand\" progress but rather to \"encourage\" the negotiations, Ha'aretz, an Israeli newspaper, reported. \"The United States cannot impose peace,\" he said, nor decide where the border between Israel and Palestine should lie. Tony Blair, representing the international \"Quartet\" of Middle East peacemakers, announced in Jerusalem yesterday that he had secured the agreement of Israel's hawkish defence minster, Ehud Barak, to ease trade and travel restrictions in the West Bank to try to boost the credibility of talks between Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, and Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister. Israel is scrapping one checkpoint near Hebron and will remove two checkpoints and one roadblock, as well as relocate a major checkpoint near Ramallah, \"once Israel determines the security situation so allows\". The Israeli army said changes would be implemented only \"in the future\" and on condition Israeli security demands were met. The UN says there are 560 such barriers. Human Rights Watch called on Bush to work to relieve the siege of the Gaza Strip, where Hamas have been isolated since seizing control from the Palestinian Authority. Hamas said yesterday it would not agree a ceasefire with Israel if Israel insisted on linking it to the release of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier with the rank of corporal, captured nearly two years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
