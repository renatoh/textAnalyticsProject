He travelled to the squad's training base in the Vale of Glamorgan after having a scan in Manchester. Peel has made one start in the Wales coach Warren Gatland's 16-month reign, against Italy in Cardiff last year, and he was originally left out of the squad for this year's Six Nations, but was recalled after Gareth Cooper needed knee surgery. Saturday was his chance to not only make an impression on Gatland, but stake his claim for a place in the Lions' squad for the summer tour to South Africa. While Wales were saying they were waiting for the results of the 67-cap Peel's scan before making a decision, the fact they made his replacement, Mike Phillips, available to the media indicated the outcome was in little doubt. \"It is a huge blow for Dwayne,\" said the Wales outside-half, James Hook. \"Like me, he has waited four matches for a start in the championship and I know how badly he wanted this opportunity.\" Wales are unsure who would replace Phillips on the bench. Cooper has recovered from his operation, but has picked up a groin strain, while Martin Roberts, who featured in the autumn internationals, damaged his ribs playing for the Scarlets on Sunday. London Irish's Warren Fury, who toured South Africa last summer but who has not featured for his club since January, was called into the squad as cover. \"It is not looking great for Dwayne,\" said the Wales physiotherapist, Mark Davies. \"I have spoken to Dwayne and he is gutted. Martin is sore but keen and we will make a decision on him on Tuesday. We are also awaiting a report from Gloucester on Gareth's fitness.\" If Phillips plays, he will be one of six players to survive after the defeat to France in Paris. \"We made too many individual errors that night and we will need to be more precise against Italy,\" he said. \"They have not made a great start to the Six Nations, but they are a proud and passionate group of players and the opening 20 minutes will be very intense.\" Wales not only need to win to maintain their hopes of retaining the Six Nations title, but do so with something to spare because of Ireland's superior points difference. Wales face Ireland on the final day of the campaign, but they are not making an issue of the fact that the match at Stadio Flaminio will be controlled by an Irishman, Alan Lewis. \"It is important that the breakdown is controlled strictly from the start,\" said Phillips. \"As a scrum-half, there is nothing more frustrating than having your possession slowed down because the tackle area is not being refereed properly. We are aware that we need to improve our points difference and that means meeting their early onslaught and playing the way we want.\" Scotland have been handed a lift ahead of Saturday's match against Ireland after Jim Hamilton, Nathan Hines and Rory Lamont returned to training."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
