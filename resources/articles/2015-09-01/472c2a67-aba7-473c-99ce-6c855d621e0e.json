They surrounded the vehicle and shouted for the passenger, 29-year-old Mark Duggan, to get out of the car. When he did an officer (known as V53 at the subsequent inquest), thought he saw a gun in Duggan\u2019s right hand. He fired twice, killing him. Duggan\u2019s death ignited the worst riots in modern English history. Starting in London, before spreading to other UK cities, the unrest lasted six days and resulted in more than 3,000 arrests across the country. The Hard Stop, named after the procedure armed police use to pull over a suspect at speed, is director George Amponsah\u2019s documentary on Duggan\u2019s death and the subsequent unrest. Premiering at the Toronto film festival this week, it follows Marcus Knox-Hooke and Kurtis Henville, childhood friends of Duggan who grew up with him on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham. Knox-Hooke, one of a group filmed on CCTV smashing up a police car, was living in a bail house when filming started, awaiting sentencing after being arrested and charged with violent disorder, robbery and burglary. Amponsah followed him as he received his sentence of 32 months, went to prison and was released. He was intrigued by Knox-Hooke\u2019s story. The one-time criminal had found religion and moved away from Tottenham two years before Duggan\u2019s death. He felt he had been pulled back into violence by the loss of his friend. Amponsah says he wanted to explore Knox-Hooke\u2019s struggle: watch him try to balance his resolve to live a peaceful, law-abiding life with his sense of loyalty to his community. He reasoned that by getting to know Duggan\u2019s friends, he\u2019d get to know Duggan. \u201cI just wanted to find out about the humanity,\u201d says Amponsah. \u201cWhat kind of people get shot by the police in broad daylight on a sunny afternoon by a bus stop in London?\u201d Knox-Hooke, who first met Amponsah in Hammersmith hospital, where we was working, recalls being wary of the director. The media had swooped on Broadwater Farm in the wake of Duggan\u2019s death. The community were suspicious of anyone hunting a story. \u201cI had a lot of trust issues at first,\u201d says Knox-Hooke. \u201cWhen George turned up with his camera everyone was shying away and giving me funny looks. Different newspapers had come to the house and because we weren\u2019t used [to the media] we opened our doors to them. The next thing you know they were slandering us. So obviously when George came around we felt like, \u2018Well, this is just another guy who\u2019s trying to gain some sort of benefit off us\u2019. There was negative energy, but George was persistent. He gained our trust\u201d. Duggan had been monitored by Operation Trident, the Metropolitan police\u2019s anti-gang taskforce. They had intelligence to suggest that he was involved in drug trafficking and gun crime (this has been denied by Duggan\u2019s family). The police performed the hard stop because they suspected he was carrying a gun. A weapon was found, wrapped in a sock, behind a fence several metres from Duggan\u2019s body after he was shot. It was not marked with his fingerprints and no significant trace of gunpowder was found on his body. The jury at the inquest into his death decided that he had a gun with him in the minicab before it was stopped by police \u2013 a majority also concluded that he had thrown it behind the fence \u2013 but also that he had not been holding a gun when he was shot. They ruled that his killing was lawful, a verdict described as perverse by Duggan\u2019s supporters. The Hard Stop is pitched as an investigation into the real Mark Duggan, but it achieves something broader and greater than that too. Timely, given the spate of police killings of unarmed black people in the US, it places the killing of a black man by police in the context of a decades long breakdown in trust between communities, like that of Broadwater Farm, and the law enforcement. Amponsah explores the history of Broadwater Farm, explicitly a riot in 1985 that lead to the still unsolved murder of PC Keith Blakelock. PC Blakelock was working to protect a group of firefighters who had been called to the estate after the riot started. He was killed by a gang wielding knives and machetes. The spark for the 1985 riot was the death of Cynthia Jarrett, who suffered a heart attack while police were searching her house. In news footage from the time one announcer notes that \u201cpolice could have prevented the riot, if they responded to community groups from Broadwater Farm\u201d. The Hard Stop suggests little has changed. \u201cWhat happened in 2011 is not an isolated incident,\u201d says Amponsah. \u201cAnd what happened in 1985 wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. These things are universal. And they always tend to start with the same issue, which is \u2013 at the very least \u2013 a perception of police brutality: state-sanctioned violence towards a member of a community. As the riots in 2011 escalated the actual reason for them in the first place started to get lost, which was a human life\u201d. The Hard Stop shows us the human beings behind the headlines. It shows Knox-Hooke reflecting on his criminal past \u2013 how he used to dominate people, ruling them through extortion and fear. \u201cGrowing up I always rated badness,\u201d he says ruefully. Today he mentors young people who grew up in a similar situation to him, including Mark Duggan\u2019s eldest son, Kamani. Similarly Henville, who has served prison time for drug offences, is shown trying to go straight (\u201cI didn\u2019t rob anyone or hustle anyone \u2013 I was just trying to be a young entrepreneur at the time,\u201d he says of days as a dealer). Amponsah denies that he\u2019s trying to sanitise the pair. The film is not, he says, \u201ca Hug-a-Hoodie exercise\u201d. But he does place value on what they did during the three years that he spent filming with them. They took significant steps to redefine themselves. \u201cWhat\u2019s been interesting is getting to know Marcus and Kurtis as they try to get on with their lives,\u201d he says. \u201c[But] the police still have this problem with them. You get the impression that there\u2019s this game of cat and mouse. One side decides, \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to leave now\u2019, but the other side, being the police, say, \u2018Well, no. You can\u2019t leave. It\u2019s not up to you\u2019.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re antagonised by [the police],\u201d says Knox-Hooke. \u201cThey come driving into the Broadwalk Farm estate doing hand gestures \u2013 gun fingers. When Mark first got shot uniformed officers were driving past putting two fingers up [he mimes 1 finger up on each hand], like \u201cone-one\u201d. Like it\u2019s a football match. One-all [referring to PC Blakelock]\u201d. (The Met say this is a rumour that was investigated at the time by borough police officers, who found no evidence that it was true.) A big part of the problem, say Amponsah and Knox-Hooke, is that communities like Broadwater Farm, which is highly ethnically diverse, are policed largely \u2013 if not entirely \u2013 by white officers. \u201cWhen all of that escalates, as it did in 2011, suddenly they bring out a black police officer to somehow come and be some sort of soothing balm for the situation,\u201d says Amponsah. \u201cThat might be something the Met does because they think it\u2019ll show they care, but that\u2019s only going to antagonise the community. Isn\u2019t that almost trying to humiliate people further? \u201cWhy are you coming now?,\u201d says Knox-Hooke. \u201cWhere were you the other 25 years? Why is it only now that a man\u2019s been shot that they want to put you there?\u201d The police involved in the killing of Mark Duggan were cleared of any wrongdoing by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in March, following the lawful killing verdict from the inquest in January 2014. Amponsah was there filming with Knox-Hooke and Henville when the inquest jury\u2019s verdict was announced. He shows Duggan\u2019s family and friends reacting with shock, anger and disbelief. Amponsah believes the truth about Duggan\u2019s death will seep out eventually. His personal take is that, equipped with bad intelligence about their suspect, the police overreacted to the threat that Duggan posed. The shooting therefore may have been a mistake. But the way the police reacted after Duggan\u2019s death? That was damning. \u201cI think they botched it,\u201d he says. \u201cAn officer potentially thought they saw a gun in Mark\u2019s hand, that seemed like a threat to themselves and their fellow officers. If we accept that then at what point do the police accept that a mistake was made? That\u2019s what Marcus says in the film: \u2018Just admit you were wrong and made a mistake\u2019. I didn\u2019t see that happening then and I don\u2019t see it happening now. There was just this kneejerk process of \u2018Let\u2019s demonise the victim of the mistake\u2019. \u201cThe police have a difficult job to do,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut I believe that if you make a mistake in your line of work, you should hold your hands up and say, \u2018I made a mistake and we will do the best we can to learn from it\u2019. I don\u2019t see the police doing that and I think that\u2019s a problem. If we\u2019re talking about a capacity to change? I\u2019ve seen it in Marcus and Kurtis. I don\u2019t really see it in the police.\u201d This article was amended on Tuesday 16 September to add further details clarifying the jury\u2019s conclusions at the inquest into Mark Duggan\u2019s death and to correct the spelling of Marcus Knox-Hooke\u2019s name and that of Mark Duggan\u2019s son, Kamani."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
