The killings \u2013 three on New Year\u2019s Eve and a fourth on New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 were all unrelated and occurred within a 15-hour period at locations in north, east and south London. The three deaths on Sunday bring the total number of fatal stabbings in the capital in 2017 to 80, Scotland Yard confirmed. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has struggled to control knife crime during his term so far, said he will \u201cwork tirelessly in 2018 and beyond to stamp out this scourge\u201d. Figures revealed in the Guardian as part of the Beyond the Blade reporting revealed that 2017 was already the worst year for deaths of children and teenagers in England and Wales since 2009. As at the end of November, 35 people aged 19 or under in England and Wales had been stabbed to death. It was last higher in 2008 when 42 young people died as a result of an attack with a knife. Two of the victims of the most recent deaths were 18 and 17, while the other two men were both 20. Last month, Cressida Dick, Britain\u2019s most senior police officer, said extra resources were needed to fight knife crime in the capital, describing her force and all public services as \u201cstretched\u201d. The first of the most recent spate of attacks was at 11.30am on 31 December when an 18-year-old man was stabbed in Enfield. He died in hospital that evening. At about 7.30pm, a 20-year-old man was fatally stabbed in West Ham, and at about 10.40pm a 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in Tulse Hill. The fourth stabbing happened at 2.30am on 1 January, when a 20-year-old man was attacked in Old Street, east London. A second man, aged in his 20s, was taken to hospital with critical stab injuries. Police have arrested a 19-year-old man on suspicion of murder following the stabbing. Commander Neil Jerome, of the Met\u2019s territorial policing command, said: \u201cIt is heartbreaking that, at a time when so many of us are contemplating what lies ahead in 2018, four families are dealing with the grief of losing a loved one to senseless violence and the callous use of knives as lethal weapons.\u201d He urged anyone with information about the attacks to contact police or Crimestoppers. Five men were arrested in connection with the murder in Enfield. There have been no arrests in the other cases. Alison Cope, whose son Joshua Ribera, AKA the rapper Depzman, was stabbed to death at the age of 18 four years ago, said the government was not doing enough and was approaching the \u201cepidemic\u201d of knife violence with \u201ctoken gestures\u201d. \u201cThis will carry on and it will be exactly the same as last year, and the year before,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have who knows how many deaths this year.\u201d Cope, who now campaigns to tackle knife crime, wants more funding and support for programmes that send people affected by knife crime \u2013 like herself \u2013 into schools and colleges to educate them on the impact. \u201cThe government promotes things that look good to the public \u2013 like knife bins, or playing certain type of music in McDonald\u2019s when young people gather, faith-led intervention,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all token gestures. \u201cIf you put a poster on a billboard that says \u201cdon\u2019t carry a knife\u201d at no point is a young person who is carrying a weapon going to look at that and think \u2018I\u2019m going to change my entire mindset because someone has printed something and put it up there\u2019.\u201d Cope, whose son was at a memorial tribute at a nightclub in Selly Oak held for a friend who had died a year earlier after being stabbed when he was killed, said you need children to feel something if you want to influence them. \u201cThe only way they\u2019re going to feel is to meet people who have experienced it, lived it, who know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said. She said her love and thoughts were with the families of those stabbed over New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cThey\u2019re not just headlines. Behind those headlines are mums, dads, grandparents, cousins, sisters, brothers all howling. Police swarming their house, telling them what happens next. Their children in a morgue, in freezers. The next stage will be the arrests, the court process. This is the beginning of a life changed forever.\u201d Khan launched the high-profile \u201cLondon needs you alive\u201d campaign and knife crime strategy after he assumed office as mayor of London in May 2016. He said: \u201cMy thoughts today are with the families of four young men who have tragically been killed in four unrelated stabbings in our city last night. \u201cThe police have today assured me that everything is being done to bring to justice those responsible for these appalling acts of violence. I urge anyone with information to come forward. \u201cThe police were out in force helping people enjoy our city\u2019s fantastic celebrations last night, and I thank them. However, it is horrific that knife crime has claimed another four young lives as the new year begins. \u201cWe will work tirelessly in 2018 and beyond to stamp out this scourge. I want to be absolutely clear \u2013 if you use a knife the full force of the law will be brought down on you. You will be caught and prosecuted.\u201d Meanwhile, West Mercia police said a woman who had suffered what is believed to be a knife injury was pronounced dead at an address in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, at 12.12am. A 49-year-old man was arrested at the scene after police were called to the property at 11.52pm on New Year\u2019s Eve. In Sheffield, South Yorkshire police said five men in their 20s were taken to hospital with knife wounds after an altercation at around 2.20am in Carver Street. Two of the men suffered life-threatening injuries and remain in hospital in a critical but stable condition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
