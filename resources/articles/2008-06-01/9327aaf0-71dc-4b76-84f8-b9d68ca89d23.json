Dads in starched shirts worked at respectable jobs while moms, never far from a feather duster, stayed home and baked blueberry muffins. In reality, many moms stayed home and baked their brains with tranquillisers to alleviate the loneliness induced by the oppressive social climate, choking on all that remained unspoken. Increasingly, in both literature and film, artists are looking beyond the decade's chrome surface, revealing the sexism, segregation, racism and poverty it concealed. In The Story of a Marriage, Andrew Sean Greer explores these themes with insight and clarity. Greer's previous novel, The Confessions of Max Tivoli, was the story of a man whose body grows younger as his mind matures; before that came his much-lauded debut, charting the 30-year course of a comet. Such trickery is absent from Greer's new novel, which addresses a more widely relevant subject: the dark truths that can lie below the smooth veneer of a marriage. Hoping to know another person's soul is, it seems, a fool's business. It's 1953 and Pearlie Cook is protecting her handsome husband, Holland, the way she always has - censoring his newspapers so that his is a world filled only with good news, and cushioning him from anything that might threaten his fragile constitution. Before she married him, his aunts warned her that he had 'a crooked heart' and their warning infuses everything: the telephone rings softly so as not to startle him, the doorbell is muted, the dog is a special barkless breed. Though their son has polio, it is shielding Holland that takes up most of Pearlie's time; it is something she has always done. Pearlie and Holland met as teenagers in rural Kentucky, and after the Second World War were accidentally reunited on a beach in San Francisco. Neither will return to the south and it is in San Francisco that they make their home, in a closed and seemingly hostile neighbourhood near the ocean. 'I was a vigilant wife,' says Pearlie with a weary pride, and it is clear that she has always been on her guard against dangerous outside forces. And then, one afternoon, everything changes. A polite, blond man in designer clothes appears, bearing expensive gifts and a story that robs Pearlie of all her certainties. Buzz Drumer reveals to her her husband's past and in doing so throws the future of her family into doubt. Pearlie must recalibrate everything. 'We think we know them,' she warns. 'We think we love them. But what we love turns out to be a poor translation, a translation we ourselves have made, from a language we barely know. We try to get past it to the original, the real husband or wife, but we never can. We have seen it all. But what have we really understood?' What the reader understands is that nothing can be taken for granted and that life can shift, and shift again, its shudders as destabilising and as sudden as a San Francisco earthquake. Buzz makes a request of Pearlie that not only shatters the life she'd imagined for her family but sends shrapnel flying into all the lives surrounding them. Meanwhile the anti-communist feeling in America has reached fever pitch and Ethel Rosenberg is in the news incessantly, a wife about to make the ultimate sacrifice for devotion to a husband. Greer has packed a tremendous amount into less than 200 pages. The story has a languorous, unhurried feel, and yet it contains many surprises. These are not always the shocking twists found so often in fiction but rather resemble the smaller jolts of real life, the moments in which we learn something new about those we love. The Story of a Marriage is a beautiful, understated novel that celebrates the heroes of private battles. It is peopled with those who have opted out - draft dodgers, conscientious objectors, and people on the margins of society who believe they are fighting for enough already, without taking on their nation's conflicts. Like them, Pearlie's war is never-ending, and it's one that she wages alone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
