Tel: 01923 807807. Website: thegrove.co.uk First impressions: Walk the public rooms in wonderment. Some exceedingly creative minds have been allowed full reign and an apparently limitless budget. There are artefacts everywhere, full of fascination. Beware of people looking up at the ceiling rather than where they are going - The Grove could become the chandelier capital of the country. The sumptuousness of it all even affects the staff, who want you to enjoy your stay and go to great lengths to ensure you do. What are the bedrooms like? All different and stuffed full of yet more artefacts. Plenty of space, huge plasma TVs, DVDs etc - every mod con. The bed? A four-poster with Perspex posts in one room; an amazing, tall bright red headboard in another - even going to sleep is an amazing experience at The Grove. The bathroom? Huge, deep, white baths; small square sinks; lovely fierce showers; towels as big as they ought to be. The restaurants? Stay long enough and you can consume comfort food in The Stables; eat a full international menu, cooked to order, in The Glasshouse or go for the ultimate in modern cooking with a classic twist in Colette's. Chris Harrod, formerly of L'Ortolan and Le Manoir aux quat' Saisons, cooks in the latter. What is there to do nearby? There is a wonderful, walkable, golf course in the grounds that is open to visitors - pay and play with no members making demands. Visit the Spa, with 13 treatment rooms, a 22m indoor swimming pool, state-of-the-art gym, or simply go to Heathrow - only 30 minutes away. How much a night? Superior rooms from \u00a3240. Deluxe rooms from \u00a3320. Suites \u00a3490-\u00a3900."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
