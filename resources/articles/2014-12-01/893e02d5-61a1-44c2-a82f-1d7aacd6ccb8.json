What to buy \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on festive entertaining but generally everyone loves cheese,\u201d says Alison Brien, fromager at Sydney\u2019s Formaggi Ocello. Brien recommends buying one or two really good cheeses instead of half a dozen mediocre ones. \u201cIf you\u2019re having a big party, serve one really stunning cheese like a whole wheel of triple cr\u00e8me cheese with truffle in it and have it as showpiece,\u201d she says. Will Studd, host of the television show Cheese Slices, is also an advocate of less is more. \u201cKeep it simple,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more cheeses you have the more difficult it is to have them in optimum condition and to match them with wines.\u201d As it\u2019s summertime, Studd recommends staying away from \u201creally stinky\u201d wash rind cheeses. \u201cIf you open the fridge it will be like someone has died and every blowfly on the planet will think it is party time at your house,\u201d he says. Instead Studd says you should look for cheeses that have some sort of point of difference and something interesting about them. \u201cThere\u2019s no point serving boring cheese \u2013 it\u2019s time to celebrate,\u201d he says. How to serve it The French have a tradition of serving only odd numbers of cheeses: three, five or seven. There\u2019s another school of thought that you should arrange your cheeses in a clockwise direction from mildest to strongest. But whichever approach you take, the most important thing to do is to take your cheese out of the fridge more than five minutes before serving. \u201cPut your cheese on a nice platter or wooden board, cover it with a damp tea towel and leave it for two to three hours,\u201d says Studd. \u201cThe two things that are really important when it comes to cheese are temperature and humidity.\u201d This enables the cheese to come to room temperature without drying out, Studd says. What to serve it with Forget the Jatz crackers and instead add some panforte, stone fruit and nuts to your cheese board this New Year\u2019s. Anthony Femia, affineur at Melbourne\u2019s Spring Street Cheese Cellar (at Spring Street Grocer) recommends pairing cheese with seasonal fruits such as lightly grilled peaches, fresh cherries and figs. He\u2019s also a fan of pecans, walnuts and dried apricots. \u201cTry to avoid the sugary pastes like quince paste as they can be filling on the stomach and dull the flavour,\u201d Femia says. Biscuits are also a no-go zone according to Studd, who recommends \u201creally good bread\u201d as an alternative. \u201cBiscuits change the texture of the cheese,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I want my wafers I will go to mass. People put stuff with cheese originally because the cheese was really bad and it was a way of making bad cheese taste better. Somehow we have adopted that.\u201d But if you really want to get into the party spirit Brien recommends some slices of panforte. \u201cIt\u2019s traditional in Italy and stunning served with cheeses,\u201d she says. \u201cYou get nuts and honey all in one mouthful. It is adding those little touches to your cheese plate that gets people talking and makes it really memorable. Excess cheese In the unlikely event you have leftovers from your cheese platter, Brien says you should wrap the cheese in baking paper first then loosely wrap it in clingfilm and pop it in a container in the fridge. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wrap it really closely in the clingfilm as that will make it get sweaty,\u201d she says. \u201cBetter still it makes a really delicious ... toastie.\u201d Four top cheeses 1. Comt\u00e9 AOP, matured 24 months If you always buy cheddar, try a French Comt\u00e9 instead. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious, smooth, nutty and everyone loves it,\u201d says Brien. She recommends Comt\u00e9 as \u201cthe perfect champagne cheese\u201d and says it also pairs well with a glass of chardonnay or pinot noir. Available at specialty cheese stores including Formaggi Ocello. $78 a kilo. 2. Holy Goat\u2019s Brigid\u2019s Well Australian goat\u2019s cheeses are at their best this time of year and Femia recommends Holy Goat\u2019s cheeses which are organic and handmade in Sutton Grange, Victoria. \u201cIt\u2019s a naturally rinded goat\u2019s cheese with citrus notes on the palate,\u201d he says. The cheese has a \u201cfudge-like texture\u201d and Femia says it goes well with wines such as chablis and viognier. Available at specialty cheese stores including Spring Street Cheese Cellar. $140 a kilo. 3. Yarra Valley Dairy\u2019s Saffy Saffy is a creamy fresh cow\u2019s milk cheese which is marinated in olive oil, garlic, lemon rind, cumin seeds and saffron. Catherine McCarthy of Yarra Valley Dairy says it\u2019s a very luxurious cheese which is perfect for special occasions like New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cIt\u2019s got a really creamy mouth feel with tang from the lemon and the unique headiness that comes from saffron,\u201d she says. Available at Yarra Valley Dairy. $14 a jar. 4. Cropwell Bishop Stilton There are some good cheeses to be found at the supermarket if you shop at the deli counter, according to Studd. \u201cThe supermarkets desperately want to be good at specialty cheeses, they are just twigging to it now,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you are going to buy from a supermarket make sure it is cut to order not pre-packed.\u201d Studd recommends Cropwell Bishop Stilton, available at Coles. \u201cIt\u2019s got a sweet-salty finish with a lovely creamy background and that\u2019s what you are looking for,\u201d he says. \u201cStilton that hasn\u2019t been frozen is very creamy, it matures slowly and it crumbles in large lumps.\u201d Serve with a sticky wine. Available at Coles. $75 a kilo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
