The 12-acre Quayside project, a partnership between Google\u2019s Sidewalk Labs and the city of Toronto, has come under increasing scrutiny amid concerns over privacy and data harvesting. This week, the US venture capitalist Roger McNamee warned that technology companies such as Google cannot be trusted to safely manage the data they collect on residents. \u201cThe smart city project on the Toronto waterfront is the most highly evolved version to date of \u2026 surveillance capitalism\u201d, he wrote to the city council, suggesting Google will use \u201calgorithms to nudge human behavior\u201d in ways to \u201cfavor its business\u201d. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook and Google, is co-founder of Silver Lake Partners, one of the world\u2019s largest technology investors. But in recent years, he has soured on many of the technology giants and their handling of data and privacy concerns. \u201cNo matter what Google is offering, the value to Toronto cannot possibly approach the value your city is giving up,\u201d he wrote, pleading with officials to abandon the project. \u201cIt is a dystopian vision that has no place in a democratic society.\u201d The letter follows news that the project\u2019s advisory panel, Waterfront Toronto, plans to delay a planned vote on the Quayside development to ensure it can undertake an \u201caccountable, transparent, and extensive\u201d evaluation of Sidewalk Labs\u2019 plans, which are expected to be submitted in the coming weeks. \u201cWe have adjusted our expected timelines accordingly to ensure that the evaluation process has the time required to meet the expectations of Waterfront Toronto, and the public as a whole,\u201d spokesman Andrew Tumilty said in a statement. McNamee\u2019s criticisms are the latest in a growing chorus of opposition to the project by high-profile technology investors and executives. Late last year, Jim Balsillie, the co-founder of BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, called the project \u201ca colonizing experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues\u201d. In 2017, Sidewalk Labs won a proposal to develop a 12-acre section of Toronto\u2019s eastern waterfront. The proposal also left the possibility of developing as many as 800 acres of the city\u2019s Port Lands area in the coming years. Originally seen as a tool for addressing affordability and transportation issues in the city, Quayside was meant to be one of the world\u2019s first \u201csmart cities\u201d, drawing on environmentally conscious design and emerging technologies to \u201caccelerate urban innovation and serve as a beacon for cities around the world\u201d. Sidewalk Labs intends to build 2,500 housing units, nearly half of them under market value. Despite initial public support for the project, Quayside has been dogged by fears of data harvesting, privacy concerns and an overall lack of transparency. In early October, entrepreneur Saadia Muzaffar resigned from the project\u2019s advisory panel, citing a lack of transparency by Waterfront Toronto and saying the organization showed \u201capathy and a lack of leadership regarding shaky public trust\u201d. Later that month, Ann Cavoukian, the former privacy commissioner of Ontario, also resigned. \u201cI imagined us creating a Smart City of Privacy, as opposed to a Smart City of Surveillance,\u201d she wrote in her resignation letter. In statement to Guardian Cities, Sidewalk Labs rejected McNamee\u2019s allegations, adding that while they welcomed public debate, \u201c[he] does not seem very familiar with what Sidewalk Labs is actually proposing\u201d. The company disputed McNamee\u2019s suggestion that they would use facial recognition technologies in the project. \u201cAs we have made clear, we believe that data collected in public space must be overseen and closely controlled by an independent and publicly accountable Data Trust, not Sidewalk Labs, Google, or any private company,\u201d said spokesperson Keerthana Rang. Toronto city council is set to discuss McNamee\u2019s letter \u2013 and Sidewalk Labs \u2013 at Thursday\u2019s meeting. Deputy mayor Ana Bail\u00e3o told Guardian Cities via email that privacy and data are some \u201cof the most significant challenges facing our society today\u201d and that councillors would review any concerns raised over the project."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
