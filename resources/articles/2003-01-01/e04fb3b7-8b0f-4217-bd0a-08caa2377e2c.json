Geese, on their way to Nottingham Goose Fair, were less elegantly shod: they were driven through a mixture of tar, sand and sawdust before they hit the road. I set aside Iain Sinclair's London Orbital, an account of walking the M25 anti-clockwise, to read this, Graham Wilson's book of eight long and appealing British rural walks. And as with the Sinclair, it's the rambling digressions that make Climbing Down such a lovely read. There are very wise asides on such matters as rural public transport, rights of way, the unintended but often deleterious impact of the success of Alfred Wainwright's books on walking, sexism among ramblers (happily, it was the Manchester Guardian that encouraged the establishment of the women-only Pinnacle Club), and the problems of long-distance walking with a dodgy hip. Each walk is illustrated by elegant pen-and-ink drawings by Gerry Dale, and the book is beautifully printed and sewn. There's a delightful sounding walk around the lighthouses of Rathlin Island, a challenging one called the Sutton Eight near Macclesfield, named after the number of pubs at which you're expected to stop en route, and a 50-mile coast-to-coast from Ullapool to Bonar Bridge (so much better than Wainwright's St Bees to Robin Hood's Bay). Sadly, there are no tips on what to wear on Wilson's walks - though you'll probably need something on your feet sturdier than pigs' socks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
