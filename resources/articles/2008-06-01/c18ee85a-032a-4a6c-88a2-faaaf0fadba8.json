It's what I am'", "bodyText": "Natacha Atlas is putting on her false eyelashes. Or so I'm told, as I await her in the dim light of a basement bar in central London, its low divans, bronze-topped tables and palm fronds doing a convincing impression of a backstreet souk cafe. Atlas's lashes, when they appear, are worth the wait, framing her green eyes, which loom large in a face masked by several layers of paste-thick makeup. In a floor-length silk gown, reclining against an embroidered cushion, she looks every inch the diva. It is 13 years since she began putting her powerful, shimmering voice to the Middle East-meets-west rhythms of dubby fusion collective Transglobal Underground. Seven solo albums later, she has addressed a conference against racism as a United Nations goodwill ambassador, and worked with musicians as diverse as Nitin Sawhney, Nigel Kennedy and Belinda Carlisle. Even so, Atlas's new solo album, Ana Hina, marks a change of direction, away from sweaty, pulsing club beats and towards a gentle, acoustic sound that sets her breathy, aching voice over lush strings, electric guitars and Arabic oud and riq. The record pays homage to some of the best-known musicians of the Middle East from the 1950s, 60s and 70s - from Lebanon, the composers and poets the Rahbani brothers and the kohl-eyed singer Fairuz; from Egypt, the singer and heart-throb Abdel Halim Hafiz. \"I'd planned it a couple of years ago,\" she says. \"But before, I never really felt capable and ready to do cover versions of classic Arabic songs. I've spent more of my life in Europe than I have in the Middle East, and so my knowledge is going to be less than somebody over there, who is performing in Arabic nightclubs all their life.\" But this changed when Atlas met the album's producer and arranger, Harvey Brough, whose work she admired \"because he played a lot of instruments, and was open to different types of music\". She sent him some recordings by Fairuz and the Rahbani brothers - \"a bunch of scratchy old tapes that had a lot of hiss on them; I was surprised that he managed to decipher what was going on there\". But Brough did decipher them, and, with him on board, Atlas decided to push ahead with an acoustic project \"to show people that not all Arabic music is music that cannot be played by Europeans. I wanted to have Arabic players, but also have western string players playing Arabic music - because that is what the Rahbani school of music did.\" It is easy to mock the word \"fusion\", but it is the only word Atlas feels comfortable with in terms of describing her own music. \"People say, 'Oh, fusion, eurgh, this is a new thing, and we don't like it,'\" she says stonily. \"No, actually - it's not a new thing. It's what the Rahbani brothers were doing in the 50s, 60s and 70s, trying to make a kind of union between Arabic music and western music. It's not that I'm here going, 'Oh, I'm going to do this, and mix this with that, and hey, isn't it new and punky and original?' No, it's not, it's been happening way before. And this fusion is natural to me, because that's what I am.\" Atlas was born in the Moroccan quarter of Brussels. Her father was a neurology lecturer of Egyptian descent (his own father had shortened the family name from El-Atlasi on his move to Europe), her mother an English costume designer. She grew up listening to Fairuz and the Rahbanis, and dreaming of becoming \"everything from a belly-dancer, ballerina, actress, all that kind of thing\". Atlas smiles. \"My mum never thought that I was going to end up behind a desk, you know, as a secretary.\" She moved to Northampton with her mother as a teenager after her parents' divorce, studied at a Steiner school in Sussex, and then travelled across Europe and the Middle East, adding Spanish to her already fluent English, French and Arabic, and perfecting her belly-dancing. Her musical career began by chance. A salsa band she was singing with sent a demo to the culture-crossing record label Nation Records, through which she began working with Transglobal Underground as their lead singer. Before long, she was borrowing their production skills for her own solo projects. Her 1995 debut album, Diaspora, brought her fans across the UK, Europe and the Middle East, as did its 1997 follow-up, Halim. The next record, 1999's Gedida, reached the French charts, but failed to register in the UK, where Atlas's swirling, trancey style appeared to have gone out of fashion. \"I don't bother with the UK any more,\" she said at the time. \"They've never understood that world music can be pop as well.\" Her own attempts to combine the two genres faltered in 2003 with Something Dangerous, a messy collage of rap, R&amp;B, drum'n'bass and French chanson. But her sixth album, Mish Maoul, was a return to form, exploring Egyptian music, bossa nova and electronica, and earning rave reviews. So has Atlas changed her mind about the UK? She nods. \"The world music scene has grown since then. And I meet more English people who are learning different languages. Fifteen years ago, I hardly met another English person who knew how to speak another language. It seems to be changing.\" Change seems to be what Atlas herself values most - along with hard work and ambition. She is modest about her brief time as goodwill ambassador - \"that,\" she says briskly, \"was a minimal participation\" - but she hopes to one day use her influence in the Middle East to open a women's refuge in Egypt. \"Many women are abandoned by their husbands, and suffer from all kinds of injustices,\" she says. \"I'd like to offer an alternative, somewhere women are safe and can be on their own and find a way to get on with their lives.\" In the meantime, Atlas will be belly-dancing her way around Europe this summer in Soupergroup, a dance-cabaret show. Other projects in the pipeline include a Spanish-language record, a classical music collaboration with composer Jocelyn Pook, and a new album that will see her singing in Arabic, English, French, Spanish and Hindi. And then, of course, there is the matter of the time-consuming maintenance of her eyelashes. Is it fair, I ask, to call her a perfectionist? She laughs. \"I hope so. I think it's best to try to aim for the best that you can do. For me, that's almost a compliment.\" Ana Hina is out now on World Village. \u00b7 Natacha Atlas plays at the Exeter festival on June 13 and at the Pigalle Club, London on June 24."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
