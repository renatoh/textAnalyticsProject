The pair had known each other for eight years, climbing an active volcano in Ecuador and hunting with Eskimos on Baffin Island. \u2018Perhaps we were not quite as cool as Stanley and Livingstone,\u2019 wrote Bonington, \u2018but we did manage to be rather British in our slightly self-conscious greeting.\u2019 Snow had already made a remarkable solo descent of the Amazon from one of its main sources all the way to the Atlantic, but according to Bonington it was a wonder he had ever managed to even leave the house. \u2018I had been amazed by his complete lack of practicality and his inability to look after himself,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018He did not know how to light a Primus, had only the vaguest notion of how to pitch a tent, and was prone to minor accidents.\u2019 They must have been quite eye-catching, with Snow wearing clothes more suited to fell walking in the Lake District \u2013 \u2018Afrika Korps-style cap, anorak, a couple of thick sweaters, Derby tweed breeches and long stockings\u2019 \u2013 and Bonington sporting T-shirt, shorts and an umbrella. By the time the pair met, Snow had lost a lot of his equipment and most of his body weight, too, but his discipline was as \u2018fixed as that of a monk\u2019. \u2018It\u2019s the going-for-ever-on-ness that I find the attraction,\u2019 he said. Bonington, however, \u2018needed tension and excitement\u2019. \u2018I feel a deep sensual enjoyment in climbing and now know that I detest walking along roads.\u2019 Snow never did complete the journey through North America and George Meegan beat him to the record in 1983."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
