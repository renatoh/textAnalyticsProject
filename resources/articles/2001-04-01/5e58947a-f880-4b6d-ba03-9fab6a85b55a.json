Managing director Brent Escott claims Club Direct is the only company that offers legal costs if an insured passenger contracts DVT. Mr Escott believes there will be a number of cases this year where holidaymakers are forced to sue airlines and travel companies. Although rare, the condition that causes a potentially fatal blood clot in the heart or lung is believed to lead to about 10 deaths a year, according to government medical experts. Other areas covered under the legal expenses section of a Club Direct policy could include tripping on faulty paving, swimming pool accidents and other injuries caused through negligence. But while Club Direct includes legal expenses, it says many other insurers do not. Mr Escott says most others exclude the need to sue and that this is often hidden in the small print. \"The exclusion for the travel trade and airlines was originally introduced when travel agents had a stranglehold on the travel insurance market, and it has remained there ever since. Ironically, of all the people you are ever likely to have to take action against after a trip abroad, the travel provider and airline must be among the most likely contenders.\" Mr Escott says holidaymakers need greater awareness. \"My view is that more providers who operate directly, rather than for the travel industry, will start to offer better deals all round, including legal expenses cover.\" He says among those that refuse to cover full legal action against the travel trade and airlines are Thomas Cook and Lunn Poly. \"We want to see all travel insurance policies drop this exclusion now,\" Escott says. \"It's a relic from the past and is not in the customer's interest. The only people it benefits are the travel agent, tour operator and airline.\" Although holidaymakers should check that legal expenses are now included as part of their travel cover, most travellers would be better off if they avoided buying their policies from travel agents, says Escott. A spokesman for Thomas Cook confirms that legal expenses against airlines is not included, but says his company would look at covering the \"supplier\" of services when it comes to legal expenses cover. This could mean legal expenses cover against a hotelier would be part of the cover. \"This should include someone who had a swimming pool accident,\" he says. Lunn Poly was repeatedly contacted but did not have a spokesperson with knowledge of insurance to comment. But Ian Chalmers, the marketing director of Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) company, there is already consumer protection and they are available to deal with complaints from dissatisfied customers.\" Mr Chalmers says DVT is now something airlines are aware of. \"I know that British Airways, for example, is making sure its cabin crew are aware of the dangers and will request passengers not to sit still for long periods.\" Mr Chalmers says those who had a legal case to bring against a tour operator and had a strong case could use the services of a solictor and then reclaim costs or use a no-win, no-fee lawyer. \"I can see Club Direct is using this to raise awareness, but I would say to people who are worried that they don't really need this cover. It is more of a marketing exercise in my view.\" While he says legal expenses cover is not essential, Mr Chalmers does believe holidaymakers should shop around before buying insurance. Paul Charles, of online broker Screentrade.co.uk, agrees and says travel agents are the last place you should go for your holiday insurance. He says some agents earned hefty commissions and had limited expertise in selling insurance. Consumer magazine Holiday Which? recently found that people buying from travel agents can end up paying four times as much than if they bought elsewhere. For example, broker TravelPlan Directcharges \u00a310 for a two-week holiday in Europe, while the same cover with Going Places would be \u00a340.99. Patricia Yates, editor of Holiday Which? says: \"Taking the time to look further afield than the main high street travel agents will ensure you are fully protected and that you pay a fair price.\" Some years ago, government watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading (Oft) clamped down on travel agents who charged holidaymakers more for not taking tied-in insurance, stating the \"large margins\" made on insurance meant some consumers were receiving poor value. Cheaper deals and equivalent cover can often be bought from specialist brokers, websites, direct from insurers or even retailers such as Boots."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
