What the leader has put to the conference kept us altogether around operating through the UN.\" Conservative party chairman Theresa May: \"This was a speech designed to secure better headlines for the prime minister, not better services for pupils, patients and commuters across Britain. \"By always concentrating on short term initiatives the prime minister is failing to focus on a long term plan to improve the country.\" Shadow health secretary Liam Fox: \"However much Tony Blair insists Labour's extra billions will solve the crisis in the NHS, patients and staff alike know that only radical and meaningful reform - not his sham reforms - can put the NHS right.\" Shadow education secretary Damian Green: \"Tony Blair claims he wants to give every child the best opportunities in the 'post comprehensive era' but his reforms are just another series of gimmicks that will do nothing for our most vulnerable children.\" Friends of the Earth director Charles Secret: \"Mr Blair was quite right to highlight the threat of globalisation. But he said nothing of acting to protect the global environment and control the abuses of multi-national corporations.\" Derek Simpson, general secretary of Amicus: \"I give the Prime Minister 10 out of 10 for theory. We now look forward to the government taking the practical test. It was very welcome to hear the prime minister pay homage to all manner of public service workers.\" Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union: \"On reform of public services we are still waiting for the route map. Reform must be more than just PFI.\" Digby Jones, director general of the CBI: \"We welcome the renewed commitment to reform of public services but the challenge is delivery.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
