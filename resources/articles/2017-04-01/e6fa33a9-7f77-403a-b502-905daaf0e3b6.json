Oxlade-Chamberlain is one of several Arsenal players whose contracts expire in the summer of 2018 but no significant progress has been made towards a new agreement with the England midfielder, Arsenal\u2019s priority seemingly being to persuade Alex S\u00e1nchez and Mesut \u00d6zil to remain at the Emirates Stadium. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s vital that Chamberlain stays at Arsenal,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe bought him when he was very young and built him up. He has a great mentality and a good football brain and it would be big damage for us to lose this kind of player.\u201d With Aaron Ramsey, Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere also approaching the final year of their existing deals, Wenger conceded that satisfying everyone\u2019s demands this summer will be difficult but he expects a deal to be reached with Oxlade\u2011Chamberlain before the player enters the final six months of his contract and becomes entitled to enter negotiations with other clubs. \u201cIt will be done this year,\u201d the manager said. Wenger stressed he wants Arsenal to retain the club\u2019s top young British players, as he believes a homegrown core to be an important quality to his squad. \u201cWe have to keep them all. Ramsey, Chamberlain, Wilshere, Gibbs. All these players we have to make decisions and manage to keep them together,\u201d he said. Other Premier League clubs are monitoring the situations of those players, with Liverpool known to be among the admirers of Oxlade-Chamberlain, in particular. Wenger is adamant that Arsenal should hold on to the player for whom they paid \u00a312m to Southampton in 2011, just before Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s 18th birthday. Despite the manager\u2019s declared fondness for him, Oxlade-Chamberlain is not a definite member of Wenger\u2019s preferred starting lineup, with half of his 24 Premier League appearances so far this season being as a substitute. Even the player\u2019s best position is unclear, although his most recent outings have been as a deep-lying central midfielder rather than as a winger. Oxlade-Chamberlain performed badly in that position in the 3-1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion last month and then underwhelmed in the same role for England against Lithuania, and injury made him miss Arsenal\u2019s past two matches, during which Mohamed Elneny and Granit Xhaka formed a strong partnership in central midfield. With the injured Santi Cazorla scheduled to return to action next season and Wilshere due to return on loan from Bournemouth, competition in central midfield is strong at Arsenal even before any potential summer recruits are factored in. All the same, Wenger says he foresees Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s long-term future being in the middle and at Arsenal. \u201cThat\u2019s always what I\u2019ve had in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve played him there a few years ago and I think he did well. He\u2019s offensive and you can feel as well that he\u2019s a guy who can get out of pressure because of his dribbling skill. And he has penetrating skills and in midfield that is important. I find as well that sometimes on the flank he is out of the way. In the middle he\u2019s more focused, he needs to be involved in the game.\u201d Wenger admitted that Oxlade-Chamberlain needs to improve the defensive aspects of the role. \u201cBecause he has not enough experience in that position. He\u2019s a player who likes to take the ball and go at people. He can lose balls but defensively he is strong in the challenge. He has that kind of robustness to deal with the body-to-body that is very important in the Premier League.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
