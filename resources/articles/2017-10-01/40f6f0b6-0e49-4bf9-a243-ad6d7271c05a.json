The transparency center will allow people to find out how long ads have been running, what wording and images are being used throughout the campaign and information on how those ads are being targeted at users based on their demographic details. For political ads that refer to a specific candidate (electioneering ads), users will be able to discover the identity of the organisation funding the campaign, the total campaign ad spend, the targeting demographics they have chosen and historical data. When electioneering ads appear on Twitter they will also be marked out as such with the messaging \u201cpromoted by political account\u201d. The changes would not affect political issue-based ads that do not name a specific candidate, although Falck said Twitter was working on this. This means that the anti-refugee messaging that insisted France was operating under Sharia law used by Secure America Now to target swing states would not be subject to the same scrutiny. \u201cThere is currently no clear industry definition for issue-based ads but we will work with our peer companies, other industry leaders, policymakers, and ad partners to clearly define them quickly and integrate them into the new approach mentioned above,\u201d Falck said. The changes come part-way through a Senate intelligence committee investigation into the Kremlin\u2019s potential meddling in US politics in which Twitter is implicated. Following revelations that Facebook had sold more than 3,000 election ads linked to a Russian agency, Twitter cross-referenced those advertisers with its own to discover similar political advertising on its own network. Twitter subsequently suspended 201 accounts, the company told the committee at the end of September. Senator Mark Warner described Twitter\u2019s internal investigation as revealed in a presentation to the committee as \u201cfrankly inadequate\u201d. The Democrat accused Twitter of failing to grasp \u201chow serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions and again begs many more questions than they offered\u201d. \u201cThere is a lot more work they have to do,\u201d he told reporters on 28 September. Last week Warner, along with senators Amy Klobuchar and John McCain, introduced legislation dubbed the Honesty Act requiring online platforms with at least 50 million monthly users to make a public record of advertisers who spend at least $500 on political ads regarding campaigns or significant legislative issues. Twitter appears to be pre-empting such legislation. Warner described Tuesday\u2019s announcement as \u201ca good first step\u201d. The changes will be made to the US before rolling out globally."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
