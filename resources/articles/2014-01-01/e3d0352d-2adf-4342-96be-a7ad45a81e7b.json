A rare example of blatant FA Cup gold-digging as opposed to romance, it was an admirable demonstration of fiscal prudence from the boss of a club in need of \u00a3150,000 just to stay afloat. In the wake of a fourth-round draw that could not have been more unkind, a brave decision that could have backfired now looks heroically prescient. Truth be told, short of one of his own players ruining everything by scoring a deserved winner, Askey's plan never looked in danger of backfiring against Championship strugglers who have failed to win 21 of the 25 matches they have played this season. Missing the in-form striker Connor Wickham, who was prevented from playing by the small print of his Sunderland loan agreement, Sheffield Wednesday started brightly and took a first-half lead courtesy of R\u00e9da Johnson but were abject after the interval. They will be grateful for the charity of poverty-stricken non-league opponents who have every right to fancy their chances of finishing the job at Hillsborough. Their reward should they do so? A visit to Spotland, home of Rochdale, one of the least box office draws available to either club involved. \"From the circumstances that we started the season with, it's probably the biggest achievement of my time here,\" said Askey, whose ties with the Silkmen as player and coach span nearly 30 years. \"It's been very enjoyable despite everything that's gone on. Our wage bill is about a third of what it was last season. We're probably bottom of the table in that regard, along with Hyde, but if I thought about these things too much I'd never sleep.\" Mid-table in the fifth tier of English football is where Macclesfield actually languish courtesy of their on-field endeavours, but their sublime equaliser was a goal to grace a far more prestigious football stage. Steve Williams, stealing in behind Glenn Loovens in the 72nd minute, demonstrated remarkable composure to deftly guide a beautifully floated Paul Turnbull pass from deep past Dami\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez with an expertly placed volley. It was a sweet caress by any standards, not least those of a Conference centre-half. Wednesday's first-half opener had been comparatively bog-standard: Johnson rose unchallenged to greet a Stephen McPhail corner on the fringes of the six-yard area and thumped a meaty header past Rhys Williams in the Macclesfield goal. With his own future hanging in the balance, Wednesday's caretaker manager Stuart Gray's post-match mood was one of measured disappointment. \"We started very well and bossed the game, but didn't build on it,\" said the man who has overseen a revival of sorts since the dismissal of Dave Jones at the beginning of December. \"The disappointing thing is that in the last 10 minutes we could have lost.\" On his own future, Gray said: \"The chairman said last week we'd have another two games and look at it. We've had those now so we'll sit down with him on Tuesday.\" On the strength of this performance, it may not take too long.
