On its website the union claimed the proposed framework \"could compound institutional racism\" because it would lead to more local deals in which women and ethnic minorities have in the past fared badly. Jocelyn Prudence, the chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (Ucea), responded furiously today, demanding that the union withdraw the allegations and remove them from its website immediately. They were unhelpful in fostering an atmosphere conducive to resolving the dispute, she said. In a letter to Sally Hunt, the AUT general secretary, and copied to the Commission for Racial Equality and the universities' Equality Challenge Unit, Ms Prudence said the accusation of institutional racism was extremely serious. \"To make glib accusations about the potential impact of the new pay framework on institutional racism is disingenuous. As you are aware, the new framework is designed to modernise arrangements, and replace the outmoded structures that have been place in the 1960s, with the specific aim of promoting equality, transparency and harmonisation. The framework will be underpinned by job evaluation which we believe is necessary to ensure equal pay is delivered for work of equal value.\" Ms Prudence said it was precisely because the new structures were aimed at delivering equal pay for work of equal value that other unions in higher education had accepted the framework. Another lecturers' union, Natfhe, is recommending the framework to members in a ballot this week but yesterday the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), which represents lecturers in new universities rejected the deal agreed by its negotiators. The AUT said the pay gap between ethnic minority and white staff had been growing since 1995 during a period when there was more local bargaining. The deputy general secretary, Malcolm Keight, said: \"Increased local discretion on pay and progression raises major concerns about equal opportunities. In our experience, it often leads to inconsistent treatment, non-transparent procedures and the reinforcement of existing institutional practices that systematically disadvantage certain groups, such as ethnic minority staff and women\". The AUT argued that as localised bargaining was being introduced through the back door, the pay gap between white and ethnic minority staff was substantial and growing, from an average of \u00a32,800 in 1995 to more than \u00a34,300 by 2001. Ms Prudence said the data used by the AUT was old and flawed. \"The press release you have issued on your website compounds this with a contorted extrapolation designed to scaremonger, and we request that you withdraw it immediately. I am sure you will agree that the way to resolve your concerns about the framework is through constructive dialogue. \"We find the AUT's continuing use of misleading allegations not related to the two central issues of the dispute is unhelpful in fostering an atmosphere conducive to resolution amongst our members and yours.\" Ms Hunt responded tonight that the union had raised a serious issue and had no reason to apologise for drawing people's attention to it. \"Our press release states quite clearly that pay discrimination along racial lines local discretion has worsened substantially in higher education during recent years. \"As we believe local discretion in pay often leads to inconsistency in treatment which can disadvantage ethnic minority staff and women, we are fearful of the effects of the employers' plans to introduce under-regulated localised bargaining. \"It is because of concerns such as this that the AUT is opposed to increased localised discretion on pay.\" Exploratory talks between the two sides are to be held on Monday, chaired by the TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber. But unless there is some progress quickly, attitudes are likely to harden at an AUT conference due to be held in Scarborough on March 24. The union is now talking about reaching local agreements with individual universities if it cannot reach a national deal - something that would leave it open to charges of hypocrisy on the issue of institutional racism. However the union has been buoyed by yesterday's surprise decision by the EIS to reject the deal reached by its negotiators and recommend its 1,761 members to vote \"no\" in a ballot scheduled for next week. The Scottish union is unwilling to link the new framework to the 6.4% pay deal for this year and next."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
