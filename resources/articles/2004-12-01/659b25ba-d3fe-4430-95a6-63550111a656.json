Four hundred film industry executives on both sides of the Atlantic were asked by Sky Movies to name the most influential person in film during 2004. The chancellor was ranked above Hollywood directors and producers in the survey. The film industry has had a turbulent relationship with the chancellor's department this year. In February, the government abruptly announced that it was closing a profitable loophole allowing UK-based film productions to claim large amounts of tax relief. Some projects folded as their budgets, heavily dependent on the tax breaks, collapsed. Later in the year, the Inland Revenue announced that it intended to crack down on \"unfair\" accounting practices such as \"double-dipping\" - claiming tax relief twice for the same item of expenditure - but that tax relief would be extended. As part of his pre-budget report, Mr Brown clarified that new rules would not be introduced suddenly. A spokesman for the UK Film Council said: \"Film is an internationally competitive global industry so it's no surprise that the chancellor has won the vote. \"Supporting the UK film industry through the tax system is crucial.\" The 400 entertainment executives who took part in the survey were also asked to name the best British film and most disappointing films of the year.
