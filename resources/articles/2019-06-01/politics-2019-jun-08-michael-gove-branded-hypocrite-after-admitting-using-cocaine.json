Figures from major political parties, along with former police officers and drugs charities, lined up to accuse the former justice secretary of double standards and of trivialising a debate on the harm caused by class A drugs. A former senior drug adviser to the government, Prof David Nutt, said Gove\u2019s disclosure was more proof that privileged politicians felt able \u201cto break the law, but not for others to do the same\u201d. Nutt also warned Gove that his confession might mean him being barred from travelling to the US to represent the UK, if he won the Tory leadership contest. Following his admission in the Daily Mail, before publication of a book about him by the journalist Owen Bennett, Gove said he \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d taking cocaine \u201con several occasions\u201d more than 20 years ago. In a further embarrassment, it has also emerged that in 1999 Gove wrote an article in the Times setting out why he opposed what he called \u201cLondon\u2019s liberal consensus\u201d on loosening rules on the use of cocaine and other drugs. In the piece, headlined \u201cWhen it\u2019s right to be a hypocrite\u201d, he set out why he believed drugs laws should not be repealed. \u201cThe knowledge that millennial demand for illegal drugs may lead to the potentially lethal adulteration of some substances hasn\u2019t been used to explain to citizens that the law is there for a purpose,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstead it\u2019s been acknowledged that some people feel they have to see in the new millennium in an altered state, so we\u2019ve been given advice on how to \u2018minimise\u2019 risk.\u201d He stated that middle-class professionals were pushing to liberalise drugs laws to deal with their own guilt over taking drugs, adding: \u201cThere is a greater sin than hypocrisy. It is the refusal to uphold values because one may oneself have fallen short of them.\u201d An opinion poll of Tory party members by the ConservativeHome website on Saturday put Gove in a distant second place on 12%, behind Boris Johnson with 43%. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Gove pledged to replace VAT with \u201ca lower, simpler, sales tax\u201d and cut business rates if he became prime minster. He argued that he had demonstrated \u201cbusiness know-how\u201d in his roles in government. The environment secretary said he would use \u201cthe money we get back from the EU\u201d to invest in \u201ctowns and communities which have suffered most from de-industrialisation\u201d, and introduce an Australian-style points based immigration system \u201cto ensure the most innovative and gifted from across the globe can help us prosper\u201d. Reacting to Gove\u2019s admission he used drugs, Nutt cited the example of the television chef Nigella Lawson, who was banned in 2014 from travelling to the US after admitting using cocaine, and suggested the same restriction could be placed on Gove. According to the US Department for Homeland Security, an individual can be denied entry for \u201cviolation of any law on controlled substances, except for simple possession of 30g or less of marijuana\u201d. \u201cMy view is that the attitude of politicians to drugs has always been very dishonest,\u201d Nutt said. \u201cThey seem to feel that it\u2019s OK for them to break the law but not for others to do the same.\u201d Nutt said Barack Obama\u2019s confession to having taken drugs did not stop him getting elected as US president and should not affect UK politicians either. But, he added, \u201cthey should be held to account if they don\u2019t agree that when in power they will revise the drug laws in favour of harm reduction and treatment rather than prohibition and punishment.\u201d Crispin Blunt, a Tory MP who co-chairs the all-party parliamentary group for drug policy reform, said: \u201cThe use of drugs by Michael Gove in his younger days, while illegal, was wholly unexceptional. Having admitted using drugs, he should have reflected honestly on the implications of a policy which has wholly failed to deter such drug use. \u201cSadly Michael \u2013 like others before him \u2013 has delivered a politically crafted and deeply unconvincing handwringing statement of regret for committing a victimless crime. The victims have largely been created by policy and the law.\u201d Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, said: \u201cMichael Gove and other Conservative leadership candidates have to be clear about where they stand on this issue \u2013 as a party they have to get their heads out of the sand. Gove\u2019s article rightly points out using drugs may have a different impact on the life of someone depending on their background \u2013 the fact that is the case is another sign of a broken system and I hope he may have grown up enough in the past two decades to see change is needed.\u201d Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about what a politician did in private 20 years ago. What I can\u2019t stand is the rank hypocrisy of potential prime ministers \u2018owning up\u2019 to drug use while backing policies that threaten those using drugs now with prison, and allows criminal gangs to profit.\u201d Senior Tories warned the admission would damage Gove\u2019s chances of winning over the Tory membership if he succeeds in reaching the final stage of the leadership contest in which grassroots Tory decide between the final two candidates. On Saturday night, Gove\u2019s supporters said they suspected the cocaine story had been leaked deliberately by the camp of one of the other candidates as part of a \u201cdirty tricks\u201d operation. The episode led to other candidates being asked about their drug use. Dominic Raab, who has already admitted taking cannabis as a student, told the BBC: \u201cIt was a long time ago and pretty few and far between. I have never taken cocaine or any class A drugs.\u201d Andrea Leadsom said in a statement: \u201cI have never taken cocaine or class A drugs. Everyone is entitled to a private life before becoming an MP.\u201d Boris Johnson has said he was offered a \u201cwhite substance\u201d at university, but none went up his nose because he sneezed. He said he has \u201cno idea whether it was cocaine or not\u201d. Paul Goodman, the editor of the ConservativeHome website, said the revelations might have a negative effect on Gove\u2019s campaign: \u201cI suspect that Michael\u2019s admission will make much less difference among party members than might be supposed. The question though is not so much what activists make of it, but what Tory MPs think. So the admission could at the margin benefit some of Michael\u2019s competitors in the first parliamentary ballot.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
