The former Manchester United and England defender, who took up his first managerial position at the Mestalla in December last year, initially to see them through to the end of the campaign, participated in a video conference call with Roy Hodgson and the assistant Ray Lewington on Wednesday. They discussed the squad for the games against Germany and Holland, with the national manager to announce his party at Wembley on Thursday. Neville, a key member of Hodgson\u2019s coaching staff for the European Championship finals this summer, took up the reins at Valencia on the understanding it would not affect his position within the national set-up. To that end he always expected to honour that agreement and link up with Hodgson and the England team as they continue their preparations for the tournament in France. Yet his club side\u2019s stuttering form over a difficult season has prompted suggestions in Spain that he should concentrate on reviving Valencia\u2019s season by remaining behind to work with those players not involved in international fixtures, rather than joining up with England. Valencia have lost seven of Neville\u2019s 15 La Liga games in charge. Their 1-0 derby defeat on Sunday against Levante, who prop up the division, was a third in succession in all competitions after a performance described as indefensible and unacceptable by the rookie manager. \u201cI apologise to the fans of Valencia because the very basic premise of a football match is that you run, fight and tackle as hard as the opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t defend what I\u2019ve just seen and I have to take full responsibility for that.\u201d Neville\u2019s side are yet to keep a clean sheet and languish 12th in the table on 34 points. Hodgson, Neville and Lewington have discussed the merits of offering Leicester City\u2019s Danny Drinkwater a first call\u2011up to the national squad following his impressive form this season with the Premier League leaders. Asked about the midfielder at a Uefa coaches\u2019 workshop in Paris this month, Hodgson confirmed that he was one of a number of fringe players under consideration. He had previously suggested it would take something special for an uncapped player to burst late on to the scene before Euro 2016. \u201cI have been watching everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been watching Mark Noble for eight years \u2013 I tried to sign him at Fulham \u2013 and Scott Dann for four years. I have been watching Ryan Shawcross, who\u2019s played for England before, and Troy Deeney for two or three years.\u201d The manager will join Lewington at White Hart Lane on Thursday evening to watch the second leg of Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Europa League tie with Borussia Dortmund, and he has Daniel Sturridge, Leighton Baines and Danny Welbeck available again after injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
