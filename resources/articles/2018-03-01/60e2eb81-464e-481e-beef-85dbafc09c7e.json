Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds", "bodyText": "The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has remained silent over the more than 48 hours since the Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users\u2019 personal data, even as his company is buffeted by mounting calls for investigation and regulation, falling stock prices and a social media campaign to #DeleteFacebook. Facebook\u2019s shares slid 6.77% on Monday following the news, knocking $36bn off the company\u2019s valuation as investors worried about the consequences of the revelations. Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes\u2019 live tracker of the world\u2019s wealthiest people. The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question. The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses \u201cmost or all\u201d of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly. \u201cIf this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook\u2019s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unlikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica\u2019s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement. On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,\u201d said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee. Referencing the government\u2019s request for Facebook\u2019s auditors to leave Cambridge Analytica\u2019s offices, Collins tweeted: \u201cThese investigations need to be undertaken by the proper authorities.\u201d The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time. Experts have long criticized Facebook\u2019s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users \u2013 now numbering more than 2 billion around the world \u2013 from signing up for the platform. Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive\u2019s silence. Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook\u2019s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation. Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: \u201cDespite the rumors, I\u2019m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It\u2019s true that my role did change. I\u2019m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.\u201d The Times reported that Stamos\u2019 responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August. \u201cAlex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cHe has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.\u201d Stamos is one of a small handful of Facebook executives who addressed the data harvesting scandal on Twitter over the weekend while Zuckerberg and Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said nothing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
