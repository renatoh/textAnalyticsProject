Talking about a failed relationship doesn\u2019t soothe the pain of heartbreak and can make some people feel even worse, a US psychologist claims. Instead of brooding over broken relationships, Walter Mischel recommends a couple of aspirin to take the edge off the pain and urges people to distance themselves from the event to improve their perspective. Ruminating on bad experiences could send people into a downwards spiral, said Mischel. Some fared better if they took a fly-on-the-wall view and wrote an account of the bad experience, referring to themselves in the third person, he added. By distancing themselves from the painful event, people could be more thoughtful about what happened without being so self-destructive. \u201cCommon wisdom suggests that if we thoroughly revisit our negative experiences to try to understand why they happened, we\u2019ll eventually be able to move on. However, new research is showing that some people only get worse by continuing to brood and ruminate,\u201d Mischel said. \u201cEach time they recount the experience to themselves, their friends or their therapist, they only become more depressed. Self-distancing, in contrast, allows them to get a more objective view, without reactivating their pain, and helps them get past the experience.\u201d Mischel rose to prominence in the 1960s for a series of landmark studies at Stanford University that investigated the beneficial effects of delayed gratification. His team set up a study of pre-school children who were given the choice of having one marshmallow or cookie immediately, or two if they waited up to 20 minutes. Most of the children who managed to wait struggled at first, but found coping strategies that ranged from turning their backs on the treats to picking their ears and noses. Years after the first experiments, Mischel\u2019s team ran more tests on adults who as children had refused the single marshmallow in favour of a greater reward later on. The scientists found a remarkable connection, with the \u201cdelayers\u201d having achieved more of their long-term goals than those who sought the immediate gratification of a single marshmallow. By the age of 25, the delayers had less risky drugs use, reached higher educational levels, and were slimmer than their counterparts. Brain scans of delayers found more activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is important for self-control, problem-solving and creative thinking. According to Mischel, learning to delay gratification early on in life provides the foundations for people to become successful adults. Mischel\u2019s advice on relationship trouble comes from research he brought together for his book on self-control, The Marshmallow Test. Among the other studies he describes is work that found an over-the-counter painkiller helped reduce the pain of heartbreak. \u201cWhen we speak about rejection experiences in terms of physical pain, it is not just a metaphor: the broken heart and emotional pain really do hurt in a physical way. \u2018Take two aspirins and call me in the morning\u2019 would be a cold-hearted response to a friend\u2019s late-night report of fresh heartbreak, but it has a solid basis in the research,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
