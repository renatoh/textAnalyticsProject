Liverpool\u2019s influential No10 is expected to be sidelined for around five weeks after scans confirmed he suffered ankle ligament damage during Saturday\u2019s Premier League win over Sunderland. The 24-year-old will miss the EFL Cup quarter-final against Leeds United on Tuesday evening, possibly seven Premier League matches, including a Merseyside derby at Everton and Manchester City\u2019s visit to Anfield, and may not return until either the weekend of the FA Cup third round or the visit to Manchester United on 15 January. \u201cPhil needs between five and a few weeks until we have him back,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cWe will see. He is not in [to face Leeds] and for the next few games.\u201d The scans allayed concerns that surgery or a three-month lay-off would be required and Coutinho has not given up hope of featuring in the new year\u2019s eve clash against Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. Coutinho has been in commanding form for a Liverpool side who sit second in the table, one point behind the leaders, Chelsea, and his loss is an untimely setback for Klopp before the demanding festive period. But the Liverpool manager is adamant the team ethic he has created at Anfield can withstand the disruption. Klopp, who is also without Adam Lallana, Daniel Sturridge and possibly Roberto Firmino against Garry Monk\u2019s side because of injury, said: \u201cPhil Coutinho is a really good football player and if we can\u2019t use him for the next few days or weeks then every team in the world would feel that. That\u2019s how it is but there is no excuse for anything. \u201cPhil, as good as he is, cannot decide games on his own even if it looks like that at times. He dribbles, he shoots and he is important but it is really a team performance that we have created. He\u2019s a very important part of that but of course we can handle it. It\u2019s not the best thing I can imagine or dream about, to show that we can play without Phil, but we have to show it and we will show it. \u201cPhil\u2019s not in, Adam is close but not in, Daniel is not in; they are all quality players but we don\u2019t look for excuses. We want to show it\u2019s possible to play the way we play football without them, but of course it is better if they are all fit.\u201d Klopp made 11 changes for the last EFL Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur and, while is expected to utilise Liverpool\u2019s resources again. The manager admits his options are limited up front \u2013 Sturridge and Lallana have yet to resume first-team training after respective calf and groin problems and Firmino is a doubt after taking a kick to the calf against Sunderland. \u201cWhichever squad and lineup we use it will be really difficult because of the situation and because we don\u2019t have a lot of possibilities to change things in the offensive line,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe need to make decisions but all the decisions we make will be about winning the game.\u201d The teenager Ben Woodburn is under consideration for a starting role against the Championship club having made his Liverpool debut as a late substitute at Anfield on Saturday. The 17-year-old, a Wales youth international, impressed Klopp during pre-season and the manager says he would have no hesitation starting the midfielder against Leeds. \u201cI think Ben is mentally ready to start a game,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cAt that moment [against Sunderland] I thought it was a good idea, he deserved it and I thought \u2018Come on, let\u2019s go\u2019. It was only a few minutes. He was ready for it. It was only after the game that I remembered it\u2019s now really difficult to keep him back again, not for Ben or for me, but for the public. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown him the Premier League for the first time, but the best news for him is there is so much time for him to improve and develop and we will help him. \u201cBut he\u2019s a very, very promising player and we want to use him as early as possible. There is no decision on when that will be, not because I\u2019m not happy with the development but because I have not decided on the lineup. He and a few others guys are in a really good way and sometimes we have to show that when they have earned something they will get something back. \u201cThe work in the Academy is really good at this moment, there is a lot of promising stuff happening, and we like to have the opportunity to show them that we have seen it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
