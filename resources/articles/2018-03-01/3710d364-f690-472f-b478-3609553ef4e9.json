The Burnley goalkeeper had been released by Ipswich Town at 16 and, having taken on a milk round to provide an income, turned out for Bury Town\u2019s reserves in the Essex and Suffolk Border Football League while studying at West Suffolk College. Pope was subsequently signed by Charlton Athletic but was still playing only at Conference level, on loan at Aldershot, a little more than four years ago. On Friday he hopes to make his international debut against the Netherlands in Amsterdam. \u201cObviously, when you get released at 16 you think making it is a far possibility,\u201d he said. \u201cI did two years of business marketing and one of sports science at college and had a couple of jobs alongside: I worked on a milk round, on an electric float, a 4am-er in a village round the corner from Soham; and in Next. But it allowed me to play 150 non-league games in three years, something which, in academy football, would have been impossible. It also got me into the men\u2019s game, which helped me grow as a player. \u201cThe lowest level I played in senior football was the Ryman Premier League, with Bury Town and Harrow Borough. Before Bury I was at their reserves [in the 11th tier of the game], and we\u2019d play at some rough grounds, like Brightlingsea and Little Oakley, places that might not even be on a map, in front of 10 men and a dog. I think I won the reserve version of the Suffolk Senior Cup. The club have the trophy. I might have a medal somewhere.\u201d The loanee from Charlton would go on to concede nine goals in a difficult five-match spell at Aldershot in late 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hard ride and Aldershot was a tough period,\u201d said Pope, whose new England team-mate Alfie Mawson would spend time on loan at Welling in the same division that season. \u201cFor me, it was something you had to get through. You have to prove yourself at every level to get to the next one. When Tom [Heaton] was injured against Crystal Palace back in September it was an opportunity for me, and my own form has blossomed into an England call-up, something I wouldn\u2019t have seen happening back then. \u201cBut, now I\u2019m here, my ambitions are greater than just being in a squad. You have to be hungry and I want to prove myself. Obviously throughout your career you set different targets. When I signed for Charlton they were in League One but my career ambition then was to play one game in League Two. I\u2019m still hungry to be the best keeper I can be and I\u2019ve come to enjoy being a No 1 at Burnley. But to play for England was the end goal. \u201cNow being here is a big opportunity and one of the best moments of my life. But I want to prove myself among my peers. My journey will help me have no fear. This Premier League season has taught me to go and enjoy it. You don\u2019t get into the England squad as a fluke, so don\u2019t be scared of the challenge, embrace it and show what you are all about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
