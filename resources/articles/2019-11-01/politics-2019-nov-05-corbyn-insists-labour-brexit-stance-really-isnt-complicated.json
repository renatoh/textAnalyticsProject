Addressing a rally in Telford on Wednesday, Corbyn will claim he is only seeking power in order to share it as he launches his own attack on Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership. \u201cThink of it like this: a good leader doesn\u2019t just barge through a door and let it swing back in the faces of those following behind. A good leader holds open the door for others to walk through because everyone has a contribution to make,\u201d he will say. The Conservatives have repeatedly singled out Corbyn\u2019s leadership style for ridicule. Michael Gove mocked him last week as being \u201cterminally weak\u201d, and when Labour was resisting the idea of a general election, Johnson repeatedly referred to him as a \u201cchlorinated chicken\u201d. The Labour leader will seek to confront such attacks directly. \u201cI will be a very different kind of prime minister. Not the kind of prime minister who believes he was born to rule. Not the kind who thinks politics is a game,\u201d he will say. Corbyn will be giving his third major speech of Labour\u2019s general election campaign, which he launched in London last Thursday. He will promise to bring about \u201creal change\u201d \u2013 the slogan of Labour\u2019s campaign \u2013 and call on voters to judge his party by its record on tackling an extensive of social issues, from class sizes to pensioner poverty. The speech comes as Labour seeks to draw a line under the divisive issue of Brexit \u2013 which Corbyn addressed in a speech on Tuesday \u2013 and move on to other policies. At Tuesday\u2019s event in leave-supporting Harlow, Essex, the Labour leader defended his claim that a trade deal with the US could cost the NHS \u00a3500m a week in increased drugs prices as \u201caccurate and credible\u201d. Labour has repeatedly sought to highlight the risk of health service privatisation in a post-Brexit trade deal with Donald Trump. Corbyn repeated the argument that it could add \u00a3500m a week to the NHS drugs bill \u2013 which Gove had earlier dismissed as \u201cridiculous nonsense\u201d. Challenged about the analysis, Corbyn described it as \u201can accurate and a credible figure\u201d. The party is so keen to highlight the figure that it mocked up a picture of a bright blue Conservative battlebus, with \u201cwe\u2019ll send Trump \u00a3500m a week,\u201d emblazoned on the side \u2013 and called it a \u201cdonation\u201d to Johnson\u2019s campaign. Corbyn\u2019s audience of Labour activists took up a chant of \u201cnot for sale, not for sale,\u201d when he mentioned the risk of NHS privatisation. Corbyn replied \u201cI hear you!\u201d and urged them to ensure voters hear that message too. The US government would seek to secure \u201cnon-discriminatory treatment\u201d for American companies within Britain\u2019s public sector, according to the official document setting out US negotiating aims for a free-trade deal. The \u00a3500m-a-week figure comes from health academic Andrew Hill, from Liverpool University, and represents an estimate of the increased cost, if all NHS drugs were charged at US prices. In a recent Channel 4 Dispatches investigation, Hill said \u201cour annual drugs bill for the NHS is \u00a318bn, if we had to have American drug prices we are talking about \u00a318bn a year going up to \u00a345bn, so that\u2019s an extra \u00a327bn a year, or \u00a3500m a week extra for the NHS to pay.\u201d The Conservatives have repeatedly ruled out making the NHS part of any trade deal, with Boris Johnson telling the House of Commons earlier this year, \u201cunder no circumstances will we agree to any free trade deal that puts the NHS on the table. It is not for sale.\u201d However, the Dispatches team found evidence that drugs pricing had been raised in several meetings between UK and US officials. Labour has alighted on the issue because it helps to underpin Corbyn\u2019s argument that Johnson would like to \u201chijack\u201d Brexit, to impose rightwing policies on Britain. In his speech on Tuesday, Corbyn repeated his insistence that Labour will not take sides between leave and remain ahead of the election. He said working-class voters in Harlow and York \u2013 leave- and remain-voting constituencies respectively \u2013 are \u201cup against it\u201d but \u201cnot against each other\u201d. Speaking before Corbyn, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, insisted Labour\u2019s position was \u201csimple\u201d. And Starmer warned that if Johnson won a majority Britain would take \u201ca decisive lurch to the right\u201d. As well as Starmer, who has been a keen advocate of a remain position, the carefully choreographed event at a hotel also featured the shadow employment rights minister, Laura Pidcock, who in the past has been more sceptical about a second referendum. \u201cWe refuse to be driven down the road of leave and remain: we respect those on both sides of the argument. This election is about saving the planet, for goodness sake. It\u2019s about ending homelessness with a massive housebuilding programme. It\u2019s about saving the NHS, taking the profits out of ill health.\u201d Harlow, where Corbyn was speaking, is a seat held by the Conservative Robert Halfon with a majority of just over 7,000. Labour is targeting seats like these, but Halfon, who was out campaigning locally himself, said Corbyn\u2019s promise of a second referendum with remain on the ballot paper would \u201cgo down like a cup of cold sick here\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s come to a 70% leave area, with Emily Thornberry saying we\u2019re a remain country: it\u2019s like Dracula walking into a garlic factory,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
