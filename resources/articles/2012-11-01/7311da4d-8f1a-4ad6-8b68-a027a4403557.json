Blankfein has nice things to say about the meeting that just concluded with President Obama and other members of the administration, and goes on to say that he \"wouldn't preclude\" higher taxes on the rich to avoid a tax and spending crisis. Asked what he thought the consequences of no congressional deal over the fiscal cliff would be, Blankfein is blunt: \"I don't know exactly what would happen but I know it will be bad.\" But he also makes optimistic noises about the state of the US economy, and talks about \"all the energy that's starting to well up in this country,\" adding: \"We only talk about the fiscal cliff, how about being on the brink of great advances for the United States?\" Bickering over tax rates isn't the important thing, says Blankfein: At the end of the day... the more important thing is to increase the size of the wealth pot. I'd rather get the country on the proper footing as the most important objective. But Blankfein also wants entitlements dealt with, raising the spectre of Europe as an example for the US of what can go wrong. A group of corporate chief executives met at the White House with President Obama, Joe Biden and other members of the administration, to discuss taxes and the fiscal cliff, among other things. None of the CEOs were talking to the press as they left the White House this evening, so reaction and responses may have to wait until tomorrow. On Comment Is Free, Michael Cohen argues that falling off the fiscal cliff isn't such a big deal \u2013 and would end up producing a better outcome: In the end, neither side has all that much to gain from dragging the fiscal cliff argument out. Now that President Obama has won re-election, and doing short-term damage to the economy is no longer in the political interests of Republicans, the outlines of a budget deal become that much easier to achieve. Moreover, all those House Republicans have to run for re-election in two years \u2013 and would prefer to do so in more optimal economic conditions, rather than in an economy undermined by growth-reducing austerity policies. Speaking before his presiding over first cabinet meeting since the election, President Obama made mention of the fiscal cliff: The second thing that we will be talking about obviously is what is on the minds of a lot of American families across the country, and that is making sure we get this fiscal cliff dealt with and that middle-class taxes don't go up. I already spoke extensively about that today. I will just repeat. There is no reason why taxes on middle-class families should go up. It would be bad for the economy, it would be bad for those families. In fact, it would be bad for the world economy. And so I think it is very important that we get that resolved. And I am very open to a fair and balanced approach to reduce our deficit and provide the kind of certainty that businesses and consumers need so that we can keep this recovery going. Writing in the Financial Times, the very smart Sebastian Mallaby has the dilemma facing President Obama and the White House in a nutshell, and explains why Obama must do more than just raise taxes: America\u2019s core budget challenge can be expressed simply. Federal health and pension promises cost 10.4% of GDP today; the CBO projects that they will cost 16.6% in 2037. No plausible tax rise can offset that leap. If Mr Obama cares about his legacy, he must acknowledge this arithmetic. The Guardian's US economics and finance editor Heidi Moore has a new \"Cliff quotes\" dissection of views on the tax and spending imbroglio known as the fiscal cliff. This time it's New York Times columnist and economist Paul Krugman weighing in: Paul Krugman Two months I'm not worried at all, six months I'm very worried. If we go halfway through the year then I think we're probably going to be seeing some pretty serious impacts, but if we go into February, no big deal. Who said it: Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning columnist for the New York Times and author of the book \u201cEnd This Depression!\u201d What it means: Krugman made this comment today in a conversation on WNYC\u2019s The Brian Lehrer Show, which I was guest-hosting this morning. The quote above was his answer to a question that asked, to paraphrase: how long we could sail over the fiscal cliff and not find the U.S. economy back in a recession? Krugman was sanguine about what would happen during the first few months, but if the Congressional fight over the fiscal cliff drags out into next year, he expects a serious hit to the economy. Krugman also doesn\u2019t buy into calling it \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d at all - he calls it \u201can austerity bomb,\u201d because it\u2019s a problem of our own making. He says the problem we\u2019re really wrestling with right now is not the $1.3tn US deficit, but the political battle in Washington. He had choice words for Grover Norquist, the powerful Republican lobbyist who has convinced many Republicans to sign a pledge against raising taxes. \u201cNorquist just had a piece in the Hill saying the way forward for Republicans is to hold the United States hostage for the debt celing again and again,\u201d Krugman said today. \u201cThat's not a deficit issue; that's \u2018we've got some crazy people using blackmail to dictate national policy.\u2019\u201d Nor is Krugman afraid of other problems with going over the fiscal cliff, like the threat of a ratings downgrade or the possibility of a markets meltdown. \u201cIf the markets tank and a deal is reached two months later, the markets will untank,\u201d he said blithely, and it\u2019s hard to disagree. As for the threat of a US ratings downgrade, \u201cto the ratings agencies, all I have to say is, if we can still quote Clint Eastwood, \u2018go ahead and make my day.\u2019...We have no reason to be afraid of these guys.\u201d Krugman doesn\u2019t believe this is a deficit problem but he\u2019s not against reducing the deficit...at the right time. Right now, he says, the economy is too weak to withstand the possibility of a slowdown in government spending. Even though he says the US is on the road to recovery, he still believes that the country is in a long-term depression. So when can we start tackling the deficit? \u201cAsk me again when unemployment hits 7%,\u201d he deadpans. Krugman, who has previously criticized bankers, also quipped about their influence on the fiscal cliff talks. A group of CEOs met with President Obama today about the fiscal cliff, and among them was the CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein. \u201cBy the way, I don't dislike bankers as people, or at least not all of them. Some of my best friends are bankers,\u201d he joked, pausing before adding: \u201cActually not so.\u201d He went on, \u201cActually the problem is that the top Wall Street guys are smart and funny, which makes it easy to think they know what they're talking about, which they don't.\u201d His message to them about the fiscal cliff? \u201cWe will talk to you but we don't necessarily have to do what you want.\u201d Heidi N Moore Great moments in White House press secretary fiscal cliff briefings, part 7363: Question: Fiscal cliff. You said, a moment ago, that there are some ideas on revenue that look good on paper that are not politically realistic. What are those? Jay Carney: Well again, I'm not going to get into specifics, but there have been... Question: Well, they are. Carney: Well, look I think that... Question: Just, do you have an idea? Carney: Sure, broadly speaking when we \u2013 you look at proposals that suggest you can achieve \u2013 and you can on paper \u2013 very large revenue targets, purely through eliminating deductions and caps, either they're only \u2013 really there are basically two ways to do that. The middle class gets hit hard because you raise taxes on the middle class. Question: Through what? Carney: Through various closures of loopholes and deductions... Question: Deduction and charitable deductions? Carney: Those are two \u2013 they come to mind. Carney later reached into the big bag of metaphor: I'm not saying that there's only \u2013 that there's one way to skin this cat, but there's one way to skin it that's clean and simple and there are other ways to skin it \u2013 and I'm going to take this metaphor to dangerous places that are, you know, [LAUGHTER] full of, you know, fur ball. The Bipartisan Policy Centre warns that the US government's debt limit of $16.394 trillion could be reached as early as next February, putting that into the mix. In a new report, the centre claims: 1. The US Treasury will reach its current statutory debt limit in the last week of December 2. Absent congressional action prior to such time, Treasury will have available Extraordinary Measures amounting to approximately $197bn in order to continue meeting federal financial obligations 3. The \u201cX Date\u201d \u2013 the date after which Extraordinary Measures are exhausted and Treasury has insufficient cash on hand to make all payments when owed \u2013 would occur in February 2013, absent an increase in the debt limit If you recall, it was the deal to raise the debt ceiling that got us into this automatic spending cuts mess in the first place. Some actual news on the fiscal cliff negotiations \u2013 more meetings tomorrow between the White House and Congressional leaders, via AP: Two of President Barack Obama's chief negotiators will meet on Thursday with congressional leaders to gauge prospects for a deal to avoid the \"fiscal cliff.\" Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House legislative chief Rob Nabors will meet separately House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. After Barack Obama pushed the hashtag #My2K to represent the $2,000 a year that a family of four would lose if the end-of-year tax hikes take place, the term itself has been trending on Twitter in the US. Guess what happened next? The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, had the bright idea of buying sponsored tweets for the #My2K hashtag. And here's the result: Also trending right now are #4WordsAftaSex and #District3eekSigns for X Factor fans in the UK, so make of that what you will. Jay Carney is holding his daily press briefing and there are many questions about the fiscal cliff negotiations, none of which Carney answers to any point of satisfaction. Asked if the president would be willing to remain in the White House over the Christmas and new year holiday period if negotiations were still on-going, Carney responds: I'm not going to speculate and be so pessimistic as to assume we couldn't get a deal done by then. How helpful. Carney does give one straight-forward answer though. When asked if Mitt Romney \u2013 tomorrow's luncheon guest in the White House \u2013 is being considered for a cabinet post, Carney replies: \"No.\" Today's meeting with big business CEOs comes with a tasty order of schadenfreude for the White House, as the National Journal points out: Only a month ago, many in the business community were openly trying to defeat the president. They denounced him as anti-business and funneled tens of millions of dollars to Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign. By one measure, the Center for Responsive Politics found the finance, insurance, and real estate sector alone contributed $52m to the Republican, or three times more than the $18m it gave to Obama. President Obama also warns of the dangers of failing to reach a deal on the fiscal cliff: If we get this wrong the economy is going to go south and it's going to get more difficult to balance our budgets ... so we really need to get this right. Tweet, email, post it on a member of Congress's Facebook page, whatever it takes. Barack Obama is speaking to a group of \"middle class tax payers\" in the White House right now, making the point again about extending the Bush era tax cuts for 98% of taxpayers. \"I'm hoping to get this done before Christmas,\" Obama tells his audience. Once again Obama whips a pen out of his pocket and says he ready to sign a bill that extends the tax cuts if Republicans in the House of Representatives pass it. I'm glad to see, if you've been reading the papers lately, that more and more Republicans in Congress seem to be agreeing with this idea that we should have a balanced approach. The Democrats in the House are ready to vote for that same bill today. If we can get a few House Republicans to agree as well, I'll sign this bill as soon as Congress sends it my way. I've got to repeat: I've got a pen. I'm ready to sign it. Obama wants members of the public to lobby their congressional representatives to back his tax plan. He urges them to call, write and indeed tweet: Call your members of Congress, write them an email, post it on their Facebook walls. You can tweet it using the hashtag #My2k \u2013 not Y2K, My2k. House Republican Tom Cole isn't backing down from his idea of taking the tax deal being offered by the White House \u2013 extending the Bush-era tax breaks for all but the most wealthy \u2013 calling it a tactical move. Cole is a former chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee and is no fool, despite being politely slapped down by John Boehner and a few other Republicans for his remarks yesterday. The Hill reports: Cole said that, if it were up to him, he would hold a vote on extending the tax rates for family incomes under $250,000 a year soon. \u201cI don\u2019t see any advantage in delay,\u201d Cole told reporters. \u201cI think the appropriate thing is to make sure that places where we know we\u2019re not going to raise taxes, we get those taken care of first. I don\u2019t think that somehow weakens our position in negotiations.\u201d Cole said that there were some in the GOP conference who agreed with his view on how to proceed, but that the Republicans were united on seeking to extend all tax rates and restraining entitlements. The White House tells the Huffington Post that it supports Senate majority leader Harry Reid's (rather mild) proposals for filibuster reform in the US Senate: This endorsement of Reid's effort to reform the filibuster is the firmest White House statement to date on the matter.... Reid has been pushing for a series of changes that would preserve the right of the minority party to hold up legislative matters via a 60-vote threshold, but would make it harder to obstruct Senate business in this manner. The Nevada Democrat has called for the elimination of one such cloture vote at the beginning of the amend-and-debate period, while maintaining the cloture vote at the end of that period. He has also sought changes that would force lawmakers who engage in a filibuster to actually perform the traditional act of standing on the Senate floor and talking. There are all manner of reasons why this is interesting, not least because it could be yet another front in the War of the Fiscal Cliff, and gives the Democratic side another bargaining chip. Also, it's a good idea. Speaker of the House John Boehner has knocked down any ideas of accepting the tax cut extension offered by President Obama \u2013 as subscribed to by at least one of his GOP comrades in Congress, Tom Cole. Speaking to journalists this morning, Boehner said \"I told Tom I don\u2019t agree with him\" over accepting the White House tax deal. Boehner then reiterated his opposition to raising taxes on the wealthiest 2% of income earners: [Tom Cole]'s a wonderful friend of mine and a great supporter of mine, but raising taxes on the so-called top 2% \u2014 half of those taxpayers are small business owners. You're not going to grow the economy if you raise the top two [per cent] rates. It'll hurt small business. It'll hurt our economy. Reuters also reported Boehner repeating his earlier views that his party was willing to support revenue increases if the Democratic party agreed to approve spending cuts: I am optimistic that we can continue to work together to avert this crisis sooner rather than later. We put revenue on the table as long as it is accompanied by serious spending cuts to avert this crisis. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer also thinks the GOP should take the tax deal on the table from Obama and move on \u2013 saying it changes the political dynamics: He's got a point. The biggest story of the day is the cracks starting to appear within the Republican congressional caucus over whether to sign up to the White House's plan on extending tax cuts for all but the very rich. Politico got the ball rolling with comments from representative Tom Cole, reporting that he \"urged colleagues in a private session\" to vote to extend the Bush tax rates for all but the highest earners \u2014 and to battle over spending cuts later. The Oklahoma Republican said in an interview with Politico that he believes such a vote would not violate Grover Norquist\u2019s anti-tax pledge and that he\u2019s not alone within Republican circles.... \u201cI think we ought to take the 98% deal right now,\u201d he said of freezing income tax rates for all but the top 2% of earners. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I agree with raising the top two. I don\u2019t.\u201d Instead, he told Politico, Republicans should fight the president over tax rates for the top earners after everyone else is taken care of. That would rob the president of the argument that Republicans are holding up tax cuts for all but the top earners, Cole said. \u201cSome people think that\u2019s our leverage in the debate. It\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 leverage in the debate,\u201d he said. Here's the highlights of the corporate leaders' guest list for today's White House tax chat: \u2022 Frank Blake, Chairman and CEO, Home Depot \u2022 Lloyd Blankfein, Chairman and CEO, Goldman Sachs \u2022 Joe Echeverria, CEO, Deloitte \u2022 Ken Frazier, President and CEO, Merck \u2022 Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO, Coca Cola \u2022 Terry Lundgren, Chairman, President, and CEO, Macy\u2019s \u2022 Marissa Mayer, CEO and President, Yahoo! \u2022 Douglas Oberhelman, Chairman and CEO, Caterpillar \u2022 Ian Read, Chairman and CEO, Pfizer \u2022 Brian Roberts, Chairman and CEO, Comcast \u2022 Ed Rust, Chairman and CEO, State Farm Insurance \u2022 Arne Sorenson, President and CEO, Marriott \u2022 Randall Stephenson, Chairman and CEO, AT&amp;T \u2022 Patricia Woertz, President and CEO, Archer Daniels Midland One of those names might be familiar: Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, no great friend of Barack Obama. And of course Arne Sorenson of Marriott, a big supporter of the Romney campaign. But that's all water under the bridge now. President Obama invites some friendly and not so friendly faces to meetings today, in his quest to win support for extending the Bush-era tax cuts due to expire \u2013 part of the tax and spending double whammy that makes up the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" scenario. This afternoon Obama plays host to some of corporate America's top leaders \u2013 including some who opposed his re-election, such as Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and chief executive of the Goldman Sachs Group. Obama also meets with some hand-picked members of the middle class who would benefit from extending the tax cuts \u2013 and the White House plans to take to social media with a new hashtag, #My2k, a reference to the estimated $2,200 tax increase that a typical family of four would see if the tax cuts are allowed to expire in the New Year. Meanwhile there is some rumblings of a civil war within the Republican party over how to respond to the White House on taxes \u2013 with some urging the GOP to accept Obama's plan and move on to spending cuts. We'll be keeping an eye on all these things as they play out today, with just 35 days to go until the edge of the fiscal cliff is reached."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
