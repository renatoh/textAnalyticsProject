Despite the popularity of TV programmes such as The Great British Bake Off and the rise of celebrity chefs, millennials \u2013 a generational cohort of 16- to 34-year-olds \u2013 say their busy lifestyles and living at home for longer mean they don\u2019t have time, or the need, to cook or develop such skills. The research from the Co-op retail chain, released on Thursday, singles out ignorance about ingredients and how flavours work together as the two biggest skills gaps within this age group, leading to many being unable to cook even a limited repertoire of dishes. \u201cThere are a number of negative perceptions of cooking among young adults\u201d said Ben Warran, executive innovation chef at the Co-op. \u201cThey see it as being stressful, not worth cooking for one and not knowing how ingredients work together. This view comes from either not learning how to cook and not being the main cook in their household, and subsequently lacking confidence in the kitchen.\u201d Meanwhile Asda has teamed up with celebrity chef James Martin to introduce a community school programme next year aimed at teaching primary school pupils simple facts about the food they eat. According to the Co-op\u2019s independent study of 4,000 participants, one in four millennials are not interested in learning how to cook, while 28% of those who can\u2019t cook claim they \u201cdon\u2019t see why they should learn\u201d. It noted the steep growth in the \u201cmeal inspirations\u201d sector, where consumers shun raw ingredients that would allow them to cook from scratch, instead opting for ready meals, pasta sauces and pre-prepared vegetables, and so on. In addition, 16% of those surveyed viewed cooking as a \u201cmeans to an end\u201d rather than something they enjoyed, and said this was a problem that could be traced back to the decline in practical cookery lessons \u2013 and facilities \u2013 in schools. Bruce Poole, founder and co-owner of the one-Michelin-starred restaurant Chez Bruce in south-west London, said: \u201cOne only has to look at the amount of ready-meals and pre-prepared food on British supermarket shelves compared to those of our continental neighbours to have real concerns about what is really going on. We are a nation of lazy cooks, who happen to like going out to restaurants more and more. I wish we were tackling this in our education system, but it is very difficult to see how.\u201d The Co-op, which runs six academy schools, has teamed up with SORTEDfood \u2013 a fast-growing social media cooking brand with over 1.6 million YouTube subscribers \u2013 to investigate the scale of the lack of interest in cooking among young adults and to devise solutions. A full report is due in January. SORTEDfood co-founder Jamie Spafford said: \u201cLearning to cook with friends through social media is what we are all about and I guess that\u2019s why we have become a movement of people that are filling the education gap. This age of cooks is slowly dying out if millennials aren\u2019t better equipped to learn to cook.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
