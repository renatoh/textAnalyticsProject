These sweet, buttery scones are best served warm, with more butter and a dollop of good berry jam. Makes a dozen. 250g plain flour 3 tbsp caster sugar 2 1/2 tsp baking powder 3 tbsp unsalted butter, softened 100g raisins (optional) 1 large egg 75g buttermilk (or yogurt) Extra buttermilk and sugar for the top of the scones Heat the oven to just above 200C/ 400F/gas mark 6. In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and butter, and with your fingertips rub it together so it turns cream-coloured and slightly crumbly - the odd bigger fleck of butter is no bad thing. If you like raisins, put them in now. In a small jug, beat the egg with the buttermilk (or yogurt), then stir this into the flour mixture. Combine until you have a firm ball of dough, then flour your worksurface and knead lightly for 10 seconds, but no more. Flour the surface again, and also the top of the dough, and roll out until it is 2cm thick. Either cut with a knife into 4cm squares, or use a round cutter of the same diameter. A quick cut downward will give you the best rise in the oven. Place the dough squares or rounds on a tray that you've lined with parchment paper, spacing them a few centimetres apart so they don't knock into each other while rising, brush the tops with extra buttermilk and dredge with sugar, if you like. Bake for 15-20 minutes until risen and lightly coloured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
