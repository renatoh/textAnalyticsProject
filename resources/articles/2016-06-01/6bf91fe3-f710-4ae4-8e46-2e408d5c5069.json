One respondent claimed to have been \u201ckicked, punched, slapped, headbutted and insulted verbally by children\u201d. Another, a teaching assistant at a school for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, feared going to work in case they suffered a serious injury. \u201cI am very concerned about the high level of violence that staff are being asked to deal with on a daily basis,\u201d the respondent said. \u201cI go to work worrying that I may be badly injured \u2013 or that one of my colleagues will. The verbal abuse is constant.\u201d The Unison report, entitled Bad Form: Behaviour in Schools, finds that almost one-fifth of educational support staff, including business managers, technicians, librarians, administrative workers, caretakers, cleaners and catering personnel, have experienced violence. However, teaching assistants \u201cbear the brunt\u201d, with three-quarters of those questioned claiming to have witnessed violence in school and more than half (53%) saying they had received verbal threats, usually from pupils (85% of cases), but also from parents (31%). Unison claimed that the behaviour is linked to staff cuts due to budget constraints. More than one-tenth of the 14,500 people who took part in the survey pointed out that there had been reductions in staff numbers, either as a result of redundancy or posts left vacant following a departure. One-fifth said their school did not have an adequate behaviour management policy. Unison\u2019s head of education, Jon Richards, said: \u201cThese are not just occasional incidents. Abuse is becoming a regular and alarming occurrence, with more than half of teaching assistants coming across violent behaviour in the classroom, the playground or at the school gates. \u201cA lack of resources means schools are unable to address behavioural issues. Dealing with these problems can dominate the day, when time could be better spent supporting children\u2019s learning.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
