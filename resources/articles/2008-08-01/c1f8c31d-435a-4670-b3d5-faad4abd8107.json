An example is the New Zealand flatworm which has colonised large areas of Ireland and Scotland since its accidental introduction in the 1960s. It is particularly unpopular because the flatworm eats native earthworms which are vital for conditioning soil. Fortunately it prefers wetter climates so its spread eastwards has been curtailed by weather conditions. Another much more exotic alien from the same country is the prickly stick insect, Acanthoxyla geisovii. Surprisingly, this startling looking insect has been established in Britain for 100 years apparently without harming any native wildlife. This variety of stick insect is one of four that can be found in Britain, three of which have colonised the west country. Three types appear to have arrived by the same route as the flatworms, their eggs imported in the soil of plants from New Zealand destined for English nurseries. The prickly stick insect was first spotted in Paignton in Devon in 1909 and Tresco, Isles of Scilly, in 1943. Experts believe that the insects were in both places after a batch of plants from New Zealand was sent to the tropical gardens at Tresco in 1907 and a batch from there transferred to Paignton in the same year. Considering the prickly variety are 100mm (4ins) long with numerous black spines it is remarkable that they remained unobserved for so long, but stick insect survival is based on the ability to blend in with the surrounding vegetation and so avoid being eaten by predators. To improve their camouflage, stick insects have been observed to change colour to suit the plant they happen to be sitting on. The two other New Zealand stick insects established in the UK, also for many decades, are the so called smooth stick insect Clitarchus hookeri and the unarmed, Acanthoxyla inermis. The type often found as a pet, the laboratory stick-insect, does not appear to survive long in the wild in the UK. Colonies found in the summer, usually on privet hedges where they have been dumped by mums and dads, disappear in the winter, killed by the frost. It is the cold, too, that has curtailed the advance of the New Zealand varieties. All of them live in Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly in areas that are normally frost free. All stick insects are remarkable in that they lay viable eggs without the need for male fertilisation and, in the case of prickly stick insects, a male of the species has yet to be found. One female can produce dozens of eggs. Food plants include bramble, raspberry, myrtle and fuchsia as well as a range of other species, so finding them is not an easy task. However, since the blackberry picking season is under way, particularly in the west country, this is a good time for a close encounter with the elusive prickly stick insect, which despite its name and alarming appearance is perfectly harmless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
