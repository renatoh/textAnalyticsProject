He said he noticed some supporters heading for the exit on Sunday before Kelechi Iheanacho\u2019s dramatic stoppage-time winner against Everton. \u201cMy message is: \u2018Supporters, don\u2019t leave early,\u2019\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThis is a team that whether we\u2019re at 9-0 or 1-1, we want you here because we will go right to the end. This is the stamina and the mentality in the team. It didn\u2019t annoy me [that fans left early] but I want them to stay. I know there can be a bit of a traffic queue getting out but this team is going to go right to the very end. At 1-1 they should never doubt that this team is finished. I\u2019m not sure if anyone left at 9-0 at Southampton, but do not leave at 1-1. We will push to the very end.\u201d Leicester\u2019s ability to strike late goals \u2013 Iheanacho\u2019s was their sixth in the league this season in the 85th minute or later \u2013 represents another of the improvements introduced by Rodgers. Under his predecessor, Claude Puel, the team had a bad habit of starting sluggishly and running out of ideas near the end, with the result that they often drew or lost when expected to win. \u201cThere was something when I came in about the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of games,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ve managed to go on a different road to that. Now look at the intensity and fitness in the team. They\u2019re breaking forward in that last period. That\u2019s a process and the players have been first class.\u201d Leicester\u2019s next match \u2013 at home to Watford on Wednesday \u2013 provides a good opportunity to consider how fast fortunes can change. Rodgers\u2019 first match as manager was at Vicarage Road in March, when a last-minute Andre Gray goal gave Watford victory. Now Watford travel as the league\u2019s bottom-placed team while Leicester are second and aiming for a seventh win in a row. Rodgers said that cultivating a winning mentality had been an important part of his work. \u201cWe had a clear vision of how we wanted to play and the standards we set,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd from that you just go into a process. And that becomes clear the longer you work together. Of course then you\u2019re fostering a mindset and mentality \u2013 that\u2019s the magic in it all; it\u2019s amazing to be a part of it. The players have a mentality that every single game \u2013 home or away \u2013 we can win. That comes from hard work and a lot of planning.\u201d Rodgers said that he \u201cwill always be thankful\u201d to Watford, the club where be began his career as a manager in 2008. He left Vicarage Road after seven months to join Reading, a decision he regrets although \u2013 and this may be pertinent in the light of his declaration that he has no desire to leave Leicester for Arsenal \u2013 he says the experience has helped him to make better career choices since then. \u201cI said on the record I made the wrong decision to move, but that has helped me in my career because it makes you think.\u201d Watford arrive under the temporary charge of Hayden Mullins after sacking Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores. Rodgers said he was surprised by the removal of the Spaniard, who began his second stint at the club in September. \u201cThey know how he works,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe was brought back in presumably because they thought he was a fantastic manager who\u2019d done well for them before and who could revitalise their season. OK, it hasn\u2019t worked out at the beginning like that, but I remember when I went in there it took us a few games to get going. Now there\u2019s so much money in the game that it frightens owners. That means they make changes that much quicker.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
