She was 63. The fashion and art worlds have been expressing their grief over the loss with an outpouring of love online. Graydon Carter, editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair, wrote a piece titled Ingrid Sischy: An Appreciation, explaining who he knew her to be. \u201cThere were so many aspects of her character to admire, but I found her saucy, cheerful stoicism to be highly attractive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen she sat down to write, she looked for truth, not fantasy.\u201d Vanessa Friedman, the fashion director and chief fashion critic at the New York Times, tweeted: \u201cFarewell to Ingrid Sischy, who lived in the white hot center of the art/fashion/creativity nexus, and chronicled it all.\u201d On Instagram, Interview posted a picture of Sischy in her trademark black-frame glasses. They said she will always \u201cbe an integral part of Interview\u201d and that \u201cshe was an extraordinary editor, interviewer, and boss, and a powerhouse in the modern magazine world\u201d. Sischy was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and grew up in Edinburgh, Scotland. She worked for an art publisher and the Museum of Modern Art, but she first became known widely throughout the art world when she was editor of Artforum, a position she held from 1979 to 1987. She wrote for the New Yorker about photography and fashion from 1988 until 1996 and in 1989 became the editor-in-chief of Andy Warhol\u2019s Interview magazine. \u201cI thought I\u2019d stay a few years, devote myself to helping the magazine find its post-Warhol life, and then get back to my writing,\u201d she said in a statement when she left the job in 2008. Throughout her time as editor-in-chief, Sischy kept up with her writing as a critic for the New Yorker, and as a contributing editor at Vanity Fair. She wrote about leading figures in the entertainment, fashion and art worlds, including Madonna and Keith Haring. Her resignation as the editor of Interview occurred after her partner, CEO and publisher of Interview\u2019s parent company, Sandra Brant, sold her 50% stake in the company. She and Brant became European editors of the international editions of Vanity Fair. Her final article will be published in the September issue and profiles Hudson Kroenig, the seven-year-old Chanel model whose godfather is none other than Karl Lagerfeld. Sischy is survived by her partner Brant, her mother Claire and her brother David."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
