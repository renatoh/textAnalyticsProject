Martin O'Neill's team struggled to beat bottom-of-the-table St Johnstone at the weekend and looked little more impressive against Hearts. But two goals in the last 10 minutes from Henrik Larsson gave them the points. Hearts started brightly and showed more ambition in the opening five minutes than they did in the entire match the last time they visited Parkhead when they were heavily criticised for an ultra-defensive performance. Yet the most potent of the early attacks came from Celtic and St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 did well with a fine saving tackle when Jackie McNamara threatened. Antti Niemi, though, did even better on his return from long-term injury when he produced an outstanding save to deny Alan Thompson, who pounced on a Steven Pressley mistake but cut short his celebrations as the flying Finn dived to touch the ball away. Celtic then enjoyed a good spell when John Hartson headed over and Niemi once more did well to smother the ball as the Welshman burst through. That momentum was briefly interrupted when Johan Mjallby somehow diverted a Ricardo Fuller cross over his own bar from virtually underneath it. But it was only a temporary respite: Niemi blocked a Henrik Larsson effort with his legs and then Stevie Fulton cleared a Mjallby shot off his line. It was all Hearts could do to get over the halfway line as Celtic attacked them from all angles and Niemi heaved a huge sigh of relief when a header from Scott Severin from a Thompson free-kick inched past a post. Celtic, for all their territorial advantage, struggled to make it count and even when Bobby Petta briefly forced his way into the game he could do little to help. It was clear that Celtic needed to make a change if they were to step up the pace and after 66 minutes they did just that as Lubo Moravcik replaced the ineffectual Petta. Initially, however, it made not a lot of difference and the pattern of proceedings remained the same. But it changed after 80 minutes when Larsson headed home a Thompson cross. The Swedish international grabbed his second six minutes later when he connected with a Moravcik cross."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
