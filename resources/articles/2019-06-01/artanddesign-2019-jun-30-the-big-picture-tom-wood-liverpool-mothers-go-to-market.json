After spending a few hours there, which earned him the local nickname Photie Man, he would head over to watch the football, surrounded by men. But at the market the crowds were mostly made up of women. Wood became fascinated with the family relationships of those around him; the features shared across different faces; the interactions between the women and girls, now celebrated in his latest show, Mothers, Daughters, Sisters, opening tomorrow at the Arles photography festival. \u201cLiverpool is a really matriarchal city in many ways,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen all the riots were going on, and unemployment was high, it was women who held everything together.\u201d Wood\u2019s Irish background helped him get to know the market-goers. \u201cEveryone in Liverpool has some kind of Irish relative. A lot of women, I\u2019d look them in the eye and it was like looking at my mother. It\u2019s like a shared understanding.\u201d The market was an ongoing source of inspiration for Wood. \u201cWhen you see women in town, around Marks &amp; Spencer and those shops, people have a kind of a mask on \u2013 the face they present is not themselves. But because this was out of town and everybody kind of knew each other, the women were just really natural and open, not dressed up particularly.\u201d Wood now lives in north Wales, but visited the market again a few weeks ago. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller, it doesn\u2019t sprawl along the road as it used to. But it was just as exciting and interesting. I don\u2019t think I would have made the pictures I\u2019ve made anywhere else in the UK. There\u2019s an energy in the place and the people are really generous and open. It was a pleasure going there every week \u2013 the pictures are made out of absolute affection.\u201d Tom Wood\u2019s exhibition Mothers, Daughters, Sisters will appear at Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles, France, from 1 July to 25 August. A book version, M\u00e8res, Filles, S\u0153urs is available from Textuel Editions (\u20ac49)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
