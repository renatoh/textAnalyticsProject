The former England stalwart picked up his fifth booking of the season in this impressive win against placid Preston and will now sit out the cup encounter at St Mary's in two weeks' time, a bitter blow for the former Saints manager Dave Jones. Yet Jones will take heart from the fact his side are beginning to look like promotion material again. This was a comfortable victory for them and the Wolves supporters who made the trip north delighted in two goals of varying significance. The first, scored by George Ndah, was clipped home after an astonishing 70-yard solo run. \"Probably the best goal I have ever scored,\" said the former Crystal Palace striker. Wolves' second, a killer strike in the 83rd minute, was poached by Ndah's strike partner Kenny Miller, who has found the net in seven successive games. \"George's goal was fabulous and I am pleased for Kenny,\" Jones said. \"He won't have done his Scotland chances any harm either because Berti Vogts was at the game.\" Vogts' predecessor as Scotland manager, Craig Brown, could be excused for not enjoying his afternoon. \"We were second best,\" he conceded. Preston will now have to start looking over their shoulders rather than at the play-offs. Wolves, on the other hand, look lively enough to make a long-awaited return to the big time. Man of the match: George Ndah (Wolves)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
