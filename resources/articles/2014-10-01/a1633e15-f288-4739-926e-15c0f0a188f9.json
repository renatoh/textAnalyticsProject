In the film, John Cantlie delivers a message under duress, warning that western governments and media are gearing up for a third Gulf war. Appearing to read from a script, he says the Obama administration has adopted \u201cexactly the same rhetoric used to rally support for the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq in 2003\u201d. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s not to hard to see where this is headed. The western media are drip-feeding the public until, what a surprise, we\u2019re embroiled in a full-scale war. \u201cHere we are, gearing up for Gulf War III \u2026 At the first sniff of something they don\u2019t like, the American war machine springs to life, whipped along by the western media, as usual. \u201cHistory repeatedly demonstrates that every leader of a country likes to have their own war \u2013 and this, now, is Obama\u2019s.\u201d The freelance journalist from Haslemere, Surrey, has worked for news organisations including the Sunday Times. The latest video, like previous films of Cantlie, shows him wearing an orange jumpsuit, like prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. In the latest message he warns that Isis have \u201cgrown exponentially, until not even the US military, the policemen of the world, are able to contain them,\u201d claiming that more than eight million people are now living in lands controlled by the militants. \u201cThose who have read the Qur\u2019an, even among Christians, know there is only one sharia law, there are no different brands,\u201d he says. The release of the film follows a moving appeal by Cantlie\u2019s sister on Monday, calling for his release. \u201cWe strongly challenge those holding John to return to your previously opened channel, to which we continue to send messages and await your response so that in keeping with everyone\u2019s wishes, we can restart dialogue. We implore IS to reinitiate direct contact.\u201d Jessica Cantlie said her father was terminally ill and incapacitated, so she was speaking as the head of the Cantlie family instead. The journalist was held captive by militants in Syria on a previous occasion, but returned to the country four months after being released in 2012. It is thought that he was trying to leave the country with the American journalist James Foley when he was abducted for the second time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
