While the UK has had the coolest summer for some years, there have been record temperatures, with deadly results, in the central European heat-wave and the southern US. Fortunately neither was as bad as the 2010 Russian summer which killed an estimated 50,000 people. The death toll from heat has led some scientists to wonder if climate change may be more deadly than currently estimated, and if hotter summers could make some places virtually uninhabitable. The danger figure for survival is a \"wet bulb\" temperature of 35C. This is the temperature shown by a thermometer wrapped in wet cloth which (like the human body) is cooled by evaporation. If it gets any hotter than this, after a time even fit and healthy people start to collapse from heat exhaustion. This can soon become heat stroke, and without immediate treatment and cooling the body's core heats up uncontrollably, and the patient is likely to die. At present, temperatures this high are rare. Hot, dry places like deserts register relatively low wet bulb temperatures; in humid climates very hot weather tends to be unstable and ends before people suffer too severely. However, the steady upward trend in temperatures means that very hot conditions may become more common. Changing sea levels, crop yields and disease patterns may be dangerous but heat itself may turn out to be a major killer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
