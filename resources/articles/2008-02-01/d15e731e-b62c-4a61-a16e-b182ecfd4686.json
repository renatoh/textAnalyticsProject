One half of Radio 1 duo Fabio and Grooverider, the DJ was arrested at the city's airport after flying in for a nightclub gig on November 23. Customs officials found 2.16 grams of cannabis in his luggage. The DJ, whose real name is Raymond Bingham, has denied deliberately smuggling drugs into the country and claimed to have accidentally left them in a trouser pocket. He remains in custody in Dubai, one of the seven emirates in the United Arab Emirates federation, and has two weeks to appeal today's sentence. \"It's ridiculous. I must have forgotten the spliff. It was a small amount. Back home I would not even get prosecuted,\" he said last month in an interview from his prison cell. The weekly Radio 1 programme, which airs at 2am each Sunday, has continued without him since his arrest. He was employed on a freelance basis and has not been paid by the station since November. Grooverider has been with Radio 1 since 1998. A Radio 1 spokesman said: \"He has made a serious mistake and he is paying a very high price.\" Four years is the minimum sentence for drug trafficking in the United Arab Emirates and the most serious offences are punishable by the death penalty. In the last 12 months, 64 British nationals have been arrested in the UAE for drugs offences, according to the Foreign Office. In 2006, US record producer Dallas Austin was sentenced by a Dubai court to four years in jail for cocaine possession, but received a royal pardon hours later and was deported. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
