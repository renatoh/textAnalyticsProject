Yesterday's 71 gave him a six-under total of 138 and a lead of two over the German Alex Cejka and Jose Maria Olazabal. Rose had to ride his luck at the 18th hole. He hit a huge hook off the tee but it bounced out of the trees to the edge of the forest. From there he had 240 yards to the green and it was necessary, as his caddie Phil \"Wobbly\" Moreby exhorted him, \"to commit to it\". Rose lashed a three-wood into a greenside bunker and played a superb recovery to a foot to confirm his lead. \"I did my best to stay in my own game and that meant not looking at the leaderboards,\" he said later. \"I dealt with being in the lead and I think that's a big advantage going into the weekend.\" The last first-round leader to win was Ben Crenshaw 20 years ago but leaders at halfway have a much better record. Mike Weir did it last year, so did Olazabal in 1999, Tiger Woods in 1997, Nick Faldo in 1989 and Sandy Lyle in 1988. Something seems to cause the sap to rise when Olazabal returns to Augusta. Twice a winner, of course, he usually confounds recent form and yesterday he did it again. Olazabal has not won for 16 months and yesterday he admitted that two good rounds would not of themselves restore all his confidence. \"If I were to win, though,\" he said, smiling. Yesterday he played the 13th, 14th and 15th in four under and said, succinctly: \"That was my round.\" Phil Mickelson, the left-hander who has reined in his driving in a bid to win his elusive first major, shot a three-under 69 to be three under for the tournament and alongside KJ Choi of South Korea, who had a creditable 70, two under. Rose was not particularly happy with the driver in his hand and at the 3rd hole his tee shot was so far left it threatened the scoreboard operators up by the green, who would not normally consider themselves in the line of fire. But he saved par before hitting another weak drive at the 5th. He was able, though, to find the green and then managed to hole from 18ft for his birdie. He dropped a shot at the 11th where, after being just short in two, he chipped to three feet and missed the par putt. He made amends at the short 12th, however, almost holing in one and tapping in from 18 inches. That said, he failed to birdie either the long 13th or 15th holes, which would have given him some insurance. The best of the early rounds came from Paul Casey, who was four over par after seven holes and then completed the next eight with six birdies, a bogey and a par. At one under after 17 holes he was in the top 10 but a bogey at the last meant only a 69. But at least the Englishman, whose major championship record is played five, missed cuts four, was safely into the weekend. Lyle made the cut at two over, Phillip Price, the Welshman in his first Masters, joined him on three over and alongside the 1999 Open champion Paul Lawrie while Ian Poulter, also on his first trip to Augusta, was right on the limit at four over and stays for the weekend. Padraig Harrington joins them, as does the 2000 champion Vijay Singh, as they both finished on four over. Darren Clarke shot a disappointing 79, however, to miss the cut by one, after starting so impressively with a 70 on Thursday, and Colin Montgomerie had a similar woeful tale to report after ballooning to an 80 and finishing seven over. Woods, who struggled to a first-round 75, played his way back into the tournament with a back nine that contained three birdies, giving him a 69, for a level-par 144. It is this inconsistency, however, that enables everyone to feel they have the answer to Woods's woes. As the one man who could put the smile back on the face of Tiger, Butch Harmon, his former coach, is not going to be asked, everyone else feels free to offer advice. The American magazine, Golf World, for instance, filled five pages in its most recent edition with pictures and comment by two eminent teaching professionals, Jim McLean and Carl Welty. They examined the Woods swing of 2000, when he won three successive majors, and the present version. \"Our photos show that Tiger's backswing position in 2004 has evolved to an almost carbon copy of Mark O'Meara's,\" they claimed. Woods, it seems, now works with O'Meara's coach, Hank Haney. For each of the past 50 years Augusta's acres have resounded to the tramping feet of the Army and cries of \"Go, Arnie, Go.\" Their General, Arnold Palmer, won four times and thrilled his troops a thousand times as he lashed into the ball with that ungainly swing that, as a young man, he made so effective. Yesterday, though, it all came to an end. Arnie, dabbing at his eyes after each thunderous reception at all 18 of Augusta's greens, will play here no more, although he will return for ceremonial duties as a starter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
