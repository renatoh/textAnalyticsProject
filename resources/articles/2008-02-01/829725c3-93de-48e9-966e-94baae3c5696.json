Georgia will be the first state to close its voting, at 7pm (midnight GMT), but California - the delegate-rich prize where Obama has pushed Clinton into a dead heat in the polls - is unlikely to declare a winner until tomorrow. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee notched the day's first victory, winning all 18 delegates at the West Virginia Republican convention. \"It was a great win for us,\" Huckabee said after voting at a church in North Little Rock, Arkansas. \"It gives us some real wind to our backs as we go into tonight.\"Huckabee won the state when McCain's backers switched their support to him to deprive Romney of a win. McCain had been trailing Romney. A new Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll showed Obama with a 13-point lead on Clinton in California. Each of the candidates plans to watch the outcome unfold at parties in their home bases: Clinton in New York City; Obama in Chicago; McCain in Phoenix; Mitt Romney in Boston; and Mike Huckabee in Little Rock. As the so-called \"Super Tuesday\" primaries approached Clinton and Obama spent the final day of campaigning on the east coast, with both seeking to manage expectations. Howard Wolfson, Clinton's communications director, said he doesn't expect a clear winner to emerge from today's massive vote. \"Despite the outcome today, which we think will be largely inconclusive, we do expect to maintain our overall lead in delegates,\" he said. The Obama camp welcomed new polls showing him closing the gap with Clinton on the national level. But the former first lady's formidable lead in many states voting today means that for Obama, finishing up to 100 delegates behind Clinton could be seen as a win. \"The fact that we've made so much progress I think indicates that we've got the right message, and the question is are we going to be able to pull some states out,\" Obama said on NBC's Today Show. \"No matter what happens, though, we're probably going to see a split decision tonight.\" Clinton voted early today in suburban New York, accompanied by her husband, the former president, Bill Clinton, after appearing on several morning television shows. \"None of us really understands what the impact of all these contests on one day will be for any of us,\" she said on ABC's Good Morning America. Clinton is losing her voice, an indication of how gruelling life on the campaign trail is. \"This is someone who has worked her heart out,\" Wolfson said. Her campaign team remains confident in most Super Tuesday states. She is counting on regional familiarity to win Connecticut and New Jersey, which border her home state of New York. However the latest Connecticut polls showed Obama leading Clinton 48% to 44%, with Clinton 11 points ahead in New Jersey. Obama is focusing on smaller, more Republican-leaning states such as Kansas and Idaho to back him, as well as states that hold caucuses rather than primaries. His operation's emphasis on grassroots engagement is considered a better match for the intimate setting of a caucus than the more impersonal setting of a primary. If Obama can eke a win in California or other states where the frontrunners are neck and neck, such as Missouri, he would vault into the next primaries with greater momentum. Republican contender John McCain is banking on decisively Romney to further drive towards the nomination. At an early rally in New York city today, he predicted victory. \"We're going to win today, we're going to win the nomination and we're going to win the presidency,\" he said. Some in the Washington conservative establishment hope that Romney can still beat McCain, but only the still slim chance of a Romney upset in California would return the Republican nomination to a two-horse race. Today's Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll had Romney leading McCain by 7 points in California. McCain still had a double-digit advantage in New York and New Jersey and many other big states. McCain and Romney exchanged barbs this morning, with McCain attacking his rival for having a \"terrible record as governor.\" \"Well, it's probably the last person I would have wanted to have write a letter for me,\" Romney said on Fox News, likening McCain's candidacy to Dole's losing 1996 presidential bid. McCain called on his rival to apologize. \"This is no way to end up this campaign,\" McCain said, \"by attacking a genuine American war hero.\" As it stands, the question has become how soon McCain can close the deal. The Arizona senator is so confident he plans to take time off the campaign trail and visit Munich for a national security conference this month. McCain picked up an 11th-hour endorsement yesterday from George Pataki, New York's popular former Republican governor, which should push him further ahead in that state. For his part, Romney has to contend not just with sceptical voters and press but the unpredictability of Huckabee. The former Arkansas governor has fallen to less than 5% in recent polls, but Huckabee has urged Romney to quit and leave room for a single avowed conservative to fight McCain. Romney acknowledged that he and Huckabee are largely chasing the same Republican voters. \"I think we take conservative voters away from each other, and I think people have to decide which of us is going to be the conservative standard bearer to run against John McCain in this primary season,\" Romney told CBS. Romney later clashed with Huckabee from afar. His campaign manager Beth Myers issued a statement denigrating Huckabee's West Virginia victory as a product of a bargain with the McCain campaign. Her remarks struck at McCain as well. \"Unfortunately, this is what senator McCain's inside Washington ways look like: he cut a backroom deal with the tax-and-spend candidate he thought could best stop governor Romney's campaign of conservative change,\" she said. Huckabee denied the allegation. \"If we win always someone has an excuse for it,\" he said. He then accused Romney of \"whining.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
