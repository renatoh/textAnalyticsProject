But four out of five young people now get on with their parents, confounding the popular image of sullen teenagers locked in their room after endless family rows. A new study into teenage attitudes reveals that their family life is more harmonious than ever before: more than half of 13 to 18-year-olds get on with their brothers and sisters; and one in three has not argued with parents during the past 12 months. Eighty-five per cent of 13 to 18-year-olds agree with the statement 'I'm happy with my family life'. A majority said their lives were 'happy', 'fun' and 'carefree'. One in 10 said they definitely did not get on with their parents. 'We were struck by just how positive today's young people seem to be about their families,' said Nick Rand of the Future Foundation. 'They're expected to be rebellious and inward-directed, but actually they want a car and material goods and worry about whether their school is serving them well. 'There's more discussion and negotiation between parents and children and a greater expectation of children's right to participate in the family decision-making process,' said Rand. 'This generation of parents is much more likely than 30 years ago to treat their children as \"friends\" rather than subordinate underlings.' 'My parents are happy to discuss things with me and make compromises,' says 17-year-old Daniel Lazell from Billericay, who has a 15-year-old sister. 'They know I go to the pub or which girl I'm going out with. As long as they know what I'm doing they're fine. 'I'm happy with family life. Being a teenager is just not like Harry Enfield's Kevin any more. When we sit down to dinner in the evening we all chat.' 'Looking back on the last 10 years, there was a lot of what you could call negotiation,' says Susie Crome, now 21, 'or you might have called it bribery. But if I did all my homework I could go out on a Saturday night. My grandparents were much more studious. I don't think they were that flexible with their children. My mum's only worry was that I had done all my work.' Young people acknowledged to researchers that they were still free from adult responsibilities, such as going to work, doing housework and providing for children. The most common family flashpoints they identified were 'tidying up' and 'household chores'. Relaxation of controls on young people is reflected throughout society. In the 1960s newspapers were scandalised when Prince Charles, then a schoolboy, ordered a cherry brandy in a pub. Thirty years later Prince Harry had to acknowledge drug use to generate a similar level of anxiety. Teenagers surveyed were most likely to select parents or charity workers as people they respected. Low-scoring occupations were actors, business people and TV presenters. Nine out of 10 young people think 'if you work hard enough, you will get just rewards'. However, some recognised this was not inevitable. 'If you are in east London,' one 15-year-old boy told researchers, 'you've got to work 110 per cent. But if you're posh, you can work 50 per cent and get away with it.' Psychologist Oliver James, author of They F*** You Up, said: 'Our surprise that teenagers say they rub along well with their parents comes because of a brief period in our history when they were identified as different beings. The norm throughout history has been a seamless transition from helping out with the family business to taking it over. The idea of teenagers rebelling and breaking away from their parents is a very 1960s thing; it's an analysis that happened to coincide with advertisers noticing teenagers too.' 'This generation appears to have inherited Thatcherite attitudes towards individualism and self-reliance,' said Rand, who interviewed 500 13 to 18-year-olds on behalf of the community affairs unit of BSkyB and analysed teenagers' views and experiences over seven years. 'They've also grown up during a period of sustained economic growth and haven't experienced recession. That contributes to their confidence in the fairness of life.' How it was for families - and how it is now Janet Crome, 54 'In our day, people were expected to be home and only wicked people stayed out all night. Now it's commonplace. Drugs just weren't an issue; the only people who took drugs were musicians. Being caught smoking was the biggest crime that anyone could ever commit. 'We had a lot of tension in our family when I was young; it was to do with behaviours and habits. I think part of that in families was to do with control. Now parents just say that's your room and you do what you like in it. 'There were no pictures of naked pop stars in my day. If I'd found a picture of a half-dressed man in Susie's room when she was 16, I wouldn't have been surprised.' Susie Crome, 21 'I was going clubbing at the weekend by the time I was 16. Everyone does it now. Mum knew I was out, but she didn't ask too many questions. If I said I was going to stay at someone's house we would get back there in the end, so we weren't really lying. She trusted me in an adult way. 'We always had agreed structures about what I could do. As long as I kept to them, that was fine. Doing my work was the one thing that mum worried about. 'If I did that, I was treated in a reasonable way all through my school years. You end up much happier. 'When a friend of mine was found with dope at 17, we all thought it was so boring. It was just the sort of thing anyone would do.' ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
