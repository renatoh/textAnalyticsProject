However, the island has a surprising number of small guesthouses and hotels that cater to those looking for a more adventurous holiday. Many are in the eastern parish of Portland, perhaps the most beautiful part of Jamaica with its lush green hills and pristine, undeveloped beaches. Others are close to the major resort of Negril, on the north coast and in the Blue Mountains. Most are modestly priced, with a distinctive character and friendly staff who give advice on reaching those secret beauty spots and low-key local joints you'd normally never find. These are not five-star hotels, though - hardly any have air-conditioning, satellite television or mini-bars. This, for many, is part of their charm. Best for alternative health IIvelyn Harris Cornwall Barracks, Rio Grande Valley, Portland (contact via 00 1 401 647 4730). $100 (\u00a360) per night for double room A traditional or 'bush' herbalist in the remote and lovely Rio Grande Valley, 'Sista' Ivy Harris is also an enterprising, independent woman who rents out an attractive one-bedroom unit set in her peaceful flower, fruit and herb garden. As well as healing the locals with murky-looking potions and preparing therapeutic herbal baths (\u00a327 per person), the formidable Ivy is highly knowledgeable about folklore and nature - and excellent chatty company. Best for artistic inspiration Blue Harbour Port Maria, St Mary, north-east coast (00 1 876 725 0289). \u00a351 per person per night with three meals Blue Harbour was Noel Coward's first home in Jamaica. Its three separate buildings (one main house and two guest villas) are still largely decorated with the original furnishings and, though slightly dilapidated, retain a Bohemian atmosphere. The property, on the edge of Port Maria Bay, is criss-crossed by winding paths, a tropical garden planted by Coward and a wonderfully glamorous swimming pool. Blue Harbour's long-time owner, American Mike Gleeson, is as raffish as the hotel - Coward would surely approve. Best for atmosphere Great Huts Boston Bay, Portland (00 1 202 251 2558). \u00a348-\u00a360 per double room/tent with breakfast Great Huts, a cliff-top collection of tents, stone huts and tree-houses, is not the hippy hangout it sounds. The tents have been carefully constructed, built on wooden platforms and decorated inside and out with intricate designs, and are as luxurious as camping gets. The place is the idea of Jewish- American doctor Paul Rhodes, who gives 20 per cent of profits to local charities and organises. Friday Sabbath ceremonies for guests and neighbours with local food, drumming and prayers. River Lodge Robin's Bay, St Mary, north-east coast (00 1 876 995 3003). \u00a324 per person with breakfast and dinner, based on double occupancy. This restored seventeenth-century Spanish fort with its own river running through the grounds is a superb budget guesthouse with simple but spacious rooms. River Lodge's location at the end of a dusty track in a low-key Rastafarian community lends it an other-worldly atmosphere. During the day the lodge's neighbour, Lion, will take you hiking to waterfalls or on boat trips; at night you can wander safely down the lane to several tiny bars for a jar with the locals. Best for expeditions Drapers San Drapers, Portland - four miles from Port Antonio (00 1 876 993 7118). \u00a328 per double room with breakfast Drapers San is owned by Maria Carla Gulotta, an Italian reggae supremo, whose love of music brought her to Jamaica many years ago. Guests may find themselves mixing with DJs, musicians and other bigwigs in the (Italian) reggae scene and Maria Carla often organises tours, big stage shows and other cultural events on the island. The local village, Drapers, is a friendly place with one excel lent bar, Woody's - and is close to several of the loveliest beaches in Jamaica. Forres Park Mavis Bank, Blue Mountains (00 1 876 927 8275). \u00a336 per double room Several miles south of the highest spot in Jamaica, Forres Park enjoys one of the most impressive loca tions on the island, with panoramic views of the Blue Mountains. Its owners are developing ecotourism and organise specialist birdwatching and mountain-bike trips as well as standard treks in the area. The hotel's staff are friendly and amusing - Maisie the chef often takes time out from her hot stove to explain various aspects of Jamaican cuisine to diners. The picturesque village is the centre of the island's coffee industry . Best for laid-back beach life Half Moon Bay Beach Five miles from Negril, Westmoreland (00 1 876 957 6467). \u00a318-\u00a324 per cabin Half Moon Bay, a privately owned beach with a curved sweep of sand and crystal-clear sea, couldn't be more different from the glitzy excesses of nearby resort Negril. There are no motorised watersports, no hustlers or hair-braiders, just a laid-back bar with cook-to-order food and several attractive wooden cabins to rent overlooking the water. Best for rockstar glamour Sanwood San San, Portland - five miles from Port Antonio (00 1 876 819 0219). \u00a3120 per double room The home of British record producer Jon Baker, Sanwood's grounds contain a luxury recording studio (used by No Doubt, Gorillaz and various members of the Marley family among others), an open-air Jacuzzi and a series of swanky huts beautifully furnished with bamboo and batik which are available to the ordinary (non-musician) public when not in use by recording stars. A daily package costing \u00a345 includes all alcoholic drinks and three delicious meals by the pool. Best for romance Likkle Paradise Long Bay, Portland (00 1 876 913 7702). \u00a315 per night for double room Just one simple room in the home of ever-gracious local Herlette Kennedy, this is the perfect place to hide away with your lover. The house is situated across the road from the unspoilt sweep of Long Bay beach, has a peaceful grassy garden with a love-seat under the trees and the room itself has an adjoining kitchen exclusively for guests' use. The nearest bar, Cool Runnings, sits right on the sand and is one of the best in Portland with an eclectic clientele of locals, backpacking tourists and European expats, most of whom own guesthouses and bars in the area. Best for views Jamaica Heights Port Antonio, Portland (00 1 876 993 3305). \u00a345 per night for double room German philosophy teacher Helmut Steiner fell in love with Port Antonio when he arrived almost 20 years ago by boat - and promptly bought an entire hill above the town. With painstaking care he has built one of the most elegant guesthouses in Jamaica, a series of spacious rooms furnished with dark wooden floors, billowing white drapes and blue shuttered verandahs. The view from Helmut's hill is staggering, stretching over the twin harbours of Port Antonio. The grounds contain their own waterfall. Best for wildlife Zion Country Cottages Manchioneal, Portland (00 1 876 993 0435). \u00a322 per double room with breakfast Zion Country, right in the southern reaches of Portland, is mostly known for the family of rare manatees (sea cows) that frolic in the bay it overlooks. Other local attractions include Reich Falls, a series of waterfalls and river pools surrounded by dense forest which is not yet spoilt by mass tourism and the nearby village, Manchioneal, where shacks serving up delicious fresh fish line the road. \u00b7 Polly Rodger Brown is a contributor to the Rough Guide to Jamaica.
