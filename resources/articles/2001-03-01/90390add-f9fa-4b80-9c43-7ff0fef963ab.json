He sees English players as a part of the European mainstream and will plan his teams and tactics accordingly. Yet as the Swede prepares to pick up the baton in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers which Kevin Keegan dropped like a red-hot poker and Howard Wilkinson handled with long tongs, he will, in spite of himself, be subjecting the national side to the sort of upheaval more normally associated with rebels at the gates. Should David Seaman's latest back injury prevent the Arsenal goalkeeper's return for Saturday's game against Finland at Anfield there is every possibility that only two of those who started the goalless draw in Helsinki last October, Paul Scholes and Andy Cole, will have survived, although Steve McManaman did come off the bench in that game. A few more of Eriksson's probables - Gary Neville, David Beckham, Andy Cole and Michael Owen - were in the side beaten 1-0 by Germany at Wembley four days earlier, after which Keegan resigned, but it is hard to escape the feeling that, training amid Cheshire's green and pleasant land this week, England will experience at the very least a new learning. It is a process, moreover, which will gather pace should the international career of Steven Gerrard be relaunched in a style befitting the 20-year-old Liverpool midfielder's outstanding potential. Eriksson clearly sees Gerrard much as Bobby Robson used to regard Bryan Robson: a combination of ability, athleticism, ambition and attitude, someone to snatch up the colours, rally the troops and lead another charge. Less happily, Gerrard is already drawing a comparison with old Captain Marvel's habit of going lame at crucial moments. Since the youngster made the last of his two appearances, as a substitute against Germany in Charleroi during last summer's European Championship, he has had to withdraw from every England squad because of recurring thigh and groin strains. Indeed the fact that he is able to join up with the England party after playing two matches for Liverpool in the space of four days is nothing less than remarkable, and even then his arrival will be delayed because he needs more treatment after Sunday's drawn game against Derby County. Eriksson would like to believe Gerrard can play against both Finland on Saturday and Albania in Tirana four days later but this may be wishful thinking. Having him available for one game would be a bonus, particularly after the England coach saw him perform so well for Liverpool in Thursday's Uefa Cup match against Porto. \"We know he needs one extra day to recover from games,\" Eriksson said yesterday, \"but from what I saw on Thursday he seems to be extremely fit. His problem is that he can't play two games a week, but Liverpool think he is improving. I hope so because he is an enormous talent.\" A midfield axis of Gerrard and Scholes would surely go a long way to resolving the shortcomings in this area which were so embarrassingly apparent in Keegan's team during Euro 2000. But Gerrard needs a protracted run in the side and this will be possible only when his injury problems have been cured. The side Eriksson fields for his first competitive England match will remain a matter of hypothesis until the team is announced shortly before Saturday's kick-off. The only certainty is that Beckham will captain England a third time, Eriksson having confirmed as much yesterday despite critical reservations about the player's leadership qualities along with his present indifferent form. \"I don't want David Beckham to do anything other than the things he does best,\" Eriksson declared. \"That would be stupid. I want him to lead by example. As a captain he can't be a Tony Adams any more than I, as a coach, can be a Trapattoni.\" In recent matches for Manchester United Beckham's effectiveness has been stifled by opposing defenders pressing him back towards the halfway line and denying him the space to deliver crosses. This has led some to feel that the player has been found out, but Eriksson does not agree. \"Look,\" he said, \"every manager whose team plays Manchester United will tell his left-sided defender to make life difficult for Beckham. That's normal. But he's not just about good crosses, he's a good all-round player. My Finland colleague would be very happy if Beckham sat on the bench on Saturday.\" Eriksson denied a report that he had had a secret meeting with Beckham last week. \"The last time I saw him was outside the dressing room at Villa Park after the Spain game when I asked him to sign a shirt for my 14-year-old daughter Lina,\" he explained. Nice to know the Swedish family Eriksson is putting its shirt on Captain Posh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
