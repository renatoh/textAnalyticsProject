For me, bleary-eyed and exhausted, my five-month-old son asleep in my arms at four o\u2019clock in the morning, that tool was an exercise ball to bounce him back to sleep (we later graduated to a rocking chair). It\u2019s not perfect. I still need to be awake and somewhat attentive but it does the job, especially as he\u2019s a relatively good sleeper anyway. But recently, while trying to settle him, I stumbled across a better solution online: the Snoo baby crib rocks an upset baby back to sleep and then slows down to keep him or her soothed and snoozing. It picks the ideal white noise for the situation. A combination of sleep deprivation and the angelic glow of my smartphone screen gave the crib a nearly Messianic quality. At last, a tool to give all of us some sleep. By this stage I\u2019d been settling for two hours. Through the delirium my mind started racing: it\u2019s all well and good to be able to rock a baby back to sleep \u2013 what if you could put them in fully awake and have the crib do all the work? Could artificial intelligence work out how to feed a bottle? It\u2019d need a refrigeration unit but that shouldn\u2019t be too difficult \u2026 In my desperate madness, I proceeded to design a machine that would effectively make me redundant in my son\u2019s life for the next few months. The logic of technological entrepreneurship is the logic of progress: once we\u2019ve found a way to technologise something, we want to know how far we can push it. Cars can double as chauffeurs, phones as personal assistants, cribs as parents, the list goes on. There\u2019s nothing intrinsically wrong with technological innovation. Engineering is precisely the art of providing tools to allow humans to get on with the business of being human without being impeded by unnecessary inconvenience. But technology always primes social values in particular ways. It\u2019s unlikely that technological disruptions of parenting will be any different. Just as global access to information has changed our appetite to pay for news, technologies that make parenting easier can prompt unexpected behaviour. For instance, with parents able to get a good night\u2019s sleep quickly and easily, there may be less pressure for secondary carers \u2013 often fathers \u2013 to take additional time off work to help care for their partner and child. Might this surreptitiously displace working parents from the home earlier than they otherwise might have chosen? A number of new families I\u2019ve met have joked about how eager the mother was to send their partner back to work to have them \u201cout of the way\u201d \u2013 technology like this might expedite the process. On the bright side, it might also provide much-needed relief to single parents and those working multiple jobs to make ends meet; providing them the opportunity to rest, explore other opportunities for income or take some time for self-care. Yet those who need to work two jobs are also those with the least discretionary income to spend on robotic cribs for their children. Although good in theory, the crib might not be available to those who need them most until they can be produced cheaply at scale. There is also a question as to how this and similar technologies could alter our conceptions of parenting itself. When I contemplated fatherhood, part of what I was committing to was bleary-eyed, sleepless nights trying to wrestle a little one back to bed. This wasn\u2019t a necessary evil, it was a defining aspect of being a parent \u2013 an exercise of self-sacrifice, presence and solidarity with my partner. If, as Snoo promises, \u201cexhaustion is optional\u201d, will manually settling your child move from an essential part of parenting into a fringe activity done by purists? If so, there might be unforeseen consequences. Once I returned to work after my paternity leave, settling my son back to sleep was on some days the only time I had with him. LED\u2013illuminated cuddles were the only moments I had with my boy; but I was exhausted and, if presented with another option, I might have been tempted \u2013 a decision I might have regretted knowing what I do now. For me, giving up my sleep was the only tangible way I could connect to my son and my new role as a father. Perhaps our baby wouldn\u2019t have been any worse off soothing in a crib \u2013 though I suspect there\u2019d be fierce debate on that point. But I have a feeling my parenting might have. Until recently, sleep rituals, nappy changes and burping weren\u2019t menial tasks that distracted from the real business of parenting; they were the defining experiences of it. In many ways, they still are. Maida Lynn Chen, director of the Pediatric Sleep Center at Seattle children\u2019s hospital, thinks similarly. She told the Washington Post, \u201cThere are certain triumphs to parenting, such as figuring out your child\u2019s cues and being able to soothe your baby in some shape or form. Really developing and growing, as a parent, your skill set to try to figure out [why the baby is crying], I think that\u2019s part of the parenting process.\u201d Andy Warhol advised people to allow the things that bore them to become thrilling instead. I\u2019m not sure if he had parenting in mind but he may as well have. Technology can make our lives easier but to pursue ease and comfort merely because we can might also make them emptier. I feel a thrill when my son falls asleep in my arms. In my better moments, I feel a thrill when he grunts to announce he\u2019s awake. With the wisdom of perspective, they aren\u2019t thrills I\u2019d trade for smaller bags under my eyes. And I\u2019m not sure what kind of a dad I\u2019d be if I did."}, "isHosted": false}}}
