Two decades, three years and three days, to be exact. But then, as Sam Whitelock said on Tuesday, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have to lose to learn\u201d, and in among all those victories, one seems particularly instructive right now. It is the most famous of the lot, the 2011 World Cup final against France. A game a lot of New Zealanders assumed they would breeze through but which, in the end, turned out as close as they come, settled by a single point, 8-7. That match was a different order of magnitude again to the one being played on Saturday. But still, the third Test against the British &amp; Irish Lions is, everyone agrees, the biggest that has been played in New Zealand since. \u201cIt definitely has that feel,\u201d Jerome Kaino said, when he was asked how it compared to the World Cup final. Three days out from the third Test, Steve Hansen sat down for a chat with a few members of the British press. He touched on a lot of topics in the 45 minutes we talked, such as his love of horses, his work as a policeman, and the business model of British rugby. Almost every last little thing, in fact, except the particulars of the upcoming match, which, he said, was a subject for another day. Hansen is a smart man, the type who does not put his finger on a piece until he is certain where he is going to move it. And at a certain point all this conversation, fascinating as it was, began to sound like a clever exercise in managing the pressure mounting on his team, a sleight of hand designed to shift the headline attention elsewhere. \u201cWhatever happens on Saturday is going to be great for us,\u201d Hansen said at one point. \u201cIf we win it\u2019ll be good, because we\u2019ll have come through a moment. If we lose, we\u2019ll have to look at ourselves again and say: \u2018Righto, what can we take and learn from that?\u2019 Yes, it will go down in history we lost the series, or that we won the series, but it\u2019s really irrelevant in the long term of a player\u2019s career. Because he\u2019ll have to move on to the Rugby Championship. And there will be an expectation that we will play well in the Rugby Championship. Whilst in that moment it will hurt, we\u2019ll let it go pretty quickly.\u201d It is a fine sentiment but surely not one he will be sharing with his players. You do not get to be the best team in the world by losing the matches that matter. Hansen pressed the point. \u201cIt\u2019s like 2015, when we won the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then, OK, so what? You\u2019ve got to win next year too, and you have to move on. So you get a wee moment to either sulk or celebrate but you\u2019ve got to keep moving, because if you don\u2019t keep moving someone is going to run you over. And there\u2019s an expectation in this country that you keep moving, an expectation that we\u2019re good at what we do. We understand that, so it doesn\u2019t become a burden, it actually becomes a challenge.\u201d Hansen, who joined the All Blacks\u2019 staff in 2004, has been around long enough to remember when the reverse was true, and the weight of expectation was a load the team struggled to bear. This side, Hansen says, are still making that transition from 2015. It has been \u201charder than people realise\u201d, he says. \u201cYou lose people like Keven Mealamu, Richie McCaw, Conrad Smith, Ma\u2019a Nonu, Tony Woodcock. All of them, bar Conrad, have played over 100 games. And that\u2019s a lot of experience. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate. We have a lot of people who play the game pretty well. But you don\u2019t just snap your fingers and replace their experience. It takes time.\u201d Time, he says, for the next group to have \u201ctheir setbacks and their successes, their moments where you hang in, and the moments when you fail to hang in. Because you learn so much from that. That\u2019s where we grow up the best, when we have adversity in our life.\u201d Add to that, Hansen says, \u201cwe\u2019ve had ... adversity, with Ben Smith not playing, Sonny [Bill Williams] suspended, Ryan Crotty out, and they\u2019re three people who play a big part in that experience, because they\u2019ve all been there\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ve groomed them to take these other people\u2019s places. And then bang! But what\u2019s the positive out of that? You\u2019ve got another group of people who have been exposed to something that maybe they\u2019re not totally ready for, but they\u2019re good enough to deal with it if we do things right.\u201d He says the team is \u201cin its infancy\u201d but they are not as callow as all that. Kieran Read is about to play his 100th Test, Owen Franks has 93 caps, Whitelock 87, Kaino, 80, Israel Dagg 64, Brodie Retallick, 63, Beauden Barrett, 51. Listen to Hansen long enough, and he almost manages to persuade you the All Blacks are the underdogs. \u201cIt\u2019s 1-1. The whole world of rugby is pretty excited about that. They\u2019re thinking: \u2018Right, here we go, we\u2019re going to knock the All Blacks off their perch.\u2019 If that does happen, there\u2019ll be a hell of a lot of people excited about that because they\u2019ve got sick of us winning. That\u2019s the reality, whether we like it or not. We don\u2019t want that to happen, because we like winning.\u201d Then, with his next breath, Hansen says: \u201cThe coach\u2019s job is not just about winning, it\u2019s about maximising the talent and then making sure in the rest of his life that person has the tools to be able to be a decent person. If you can do that, that\u2019s success. Doesn\u2019t matter what else you do. Winning things, great, that\u2019s a bonus. But the reason I coach is because I want to see your smile on your face when you can do something you couldn\u2019t do before.\u201d After all, he says, \u201cit\u2019s an important game, but it\u2019s just a game, and don\u2019t lose sight of that\u201d. It hurts, he says, \u201cto lose a game of footie\u201d. Maybe more than he lets on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
