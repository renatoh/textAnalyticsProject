India, too, were drifting, but the Pakistan captain may find it harder to reel them in. Virender Sehwag moved on to 173 and Sachin Tendulkar fell six runs short of what would have been a record 35th Test hundred, but India batted too slowly to drive home their advantage in the first Test. They were particularly cautious in the last two sessions, scoring 129 runs in 60 overs. They finished 135 ahead when their lead should have been 250. Pakistan, having batted and bowled woefully on the first two days, had vastly increased their chances of saving the Test. Sehwag, who had announced yesterday that he intended to bat through the third day, moved his focus from the long handle to the long haul. \"Our aim was just to play out time,\" he said after the day's play. \"It was in the team's interest to stay at the crease, and so we did.\" Sehwag's 100-run partnership with Gautam Gambhir the previous day had come off 95 balls; the same milestone with Rahul Dravid took 199 balls, and Dravid's contribution was greater. Sehwag had his moments, including three fours in an over off Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and a majestic six over long-off off Abdul Razzaq, but they were aberrations. And Pakistan bowled to a plan. Having identified Sehwag's weakness against the short ball directed at his body, they kept peppering him - Mohammad Sami before lunch and Razzaq after. His reluctance to pull or hook left him constantly defending on the back foot, and he was discomfited by some snorters from Sami. The strategy worked, as eventually Sehwag decided to forget about percentages and put that darned short ball away. He mishit an attempted pull off Razzaq straight to Yousuf Youhana at mid-on, and the crowd, which had lustily chanted his name all day, fell silent. Dravid had not batted as fluidly as the previous day and was out in the morning for 50, cutting Sami to Asim Kamal at gully. Tendulkar played beautifully in the first session, classy strokeplay interspersed with impenetrable defence, but he showed excessive caution in the second session, in which India made 59 runs in 29 overs. One of the most dramatic shifts in recent cricketing history has been that of Tendulkar from a hunter to a gatherer, but he wasn't even gathering here, merely lolling on the farm. If India gagged, it was because Pakistan choked them. Danish Kaneria and Razzaq, in particular, redeemed their efforts of the second day. Kaneria, demonstrating great variety in spin and flight and getting good bounce, troubled all the batsmen except Sehwag, who was picking him beautifully. He bowled for almost the entire day and never lost his accuracy. Razzaq bowled a superb spell of 17 overs for 66 runs and the claimed wicket of Sehwag. Nine of these overs came after lunch, and were crucial in putting Pakistan back into the game. He bent his back, did not stray in line and length, and kept troubling the batsmen with the short stuff. Sehwag and Sourav Ganguly both found him hard to handle and Tendulkar played him with respect. A delay in introducing the new ball - until after 120 overs - also helped Pakistan. \"The old ball is softer,\" Sehwag said, \"and it became difficult to score with it.\" The crowd grew impatient as Tendulkar's century neared, and Tendulkar grew jittery. He complained about movement above the sightscreen and held up play when he was on 86; he tried a wild slog sweep off Kaneria when on 90; and eventually he unleashed an ambitious drive off Naved, edging to Kamal at gully. There was still almost an hour's play left, but many spectators started streaming out. How much would India's tardiness cost them? \"The pitch won't help our bowlers as much in the second innings as it did in the first,\" Sehwag said. \"Our bowlers will have to bowl accurately and be patient.\" But is there enough time to be patient?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
