The Football Association is furious over the incident, which occurred on Sunday morning, two days before the teams meet in Tuesday\u2019s semi-final. It claimed that it would never scope out another team\u2019s hotel \u2013 let alone enter their inner sanctum \u2013 while they were still in the tournament. It is understood the US officials were not wearing official team uniforms when they were shown round the Fourvi\u00e8re hotel, an exclusive resort located by Lyon\u2019s Roman amphitheatre, by hotel staff. However, the row was played down by the US manager, Jill Ellis, who insisted her officials were merely scouting the hotel as a potential base for her team for Sunday\u2019s final. \u201cI would assume everybody is doing that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to plan ahead. The only ones who went were the team administrator and her boss. We don\u2019t worry about that. That\u2019s who the two were.\u201d Ellis also denied that this latest incident \u2013 which some here in Lyon are also calling Hotelgate \u2013 was another example of her team being arrogant. Earlier in the tournament the US defender Ali Krieger claimed that the Americans \u201chave the best team in the world \u2013 and the second best team in the world\u201d. \u201cArrogance has nothing to do with us,\u201d replied Ellis. \u201cThat\u2019s planning and preparation for staff. I had no idea how we were even going to get to Lyon. \u201cAli\u2019s played for a lot of different teams and on the 2015 team,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a comment about ourselves and how she feels because has played in two different teams. She has the right to say that. \u201cIt is important that we have confidence. We are not arrogant. We know we have to earn everything and have tough opponents. We have to earn every right to go further in this tournament.\u201d But the US\u2019s decision to scout England\u2019s hotel in the first place drew criticism from Neville, who insisted his staff would never countenance such a thing. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I would want my team\u2019s operations doing. England would not do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am happy with our hotel and we were training. I hope they enjoyed our hotel. It is not something we would do, send somebody round, but it is their problem. \u201cJill Ellis wouldn\u2019t have been happy and nor would I have been and I am sure she will be dealing with that infrastructure within her discipline.\u201d It is unclear what exactly the US officials saw in their secret meeting rooms before they were discovered by England staff. However, Neville brushed aside suggestions that it could damage England\u2019s chances in Tuesday\u2019s match. \u201cIt\u2019ll have no bearing on the game. To be honest I found it funny,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought: \u2018What are they doing?\u2019 It is not etiquette. It\u2019s not something I would allow from our organisation.\u201d Meanwhile Ellis, who was born in England before moving to the US when she was 15, admitted that she still had some affinity for the UK. \u201cI was a Pompey lass \u2013 although I was a United fan from seven,\u201d she said. \u201cWe spent many summers in Edinburgh. My whole British culture in growing up is with me for sure. If I had grown up in another country, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have had the same passion for football. \u201cI grew up playing in the schoolyard and backyard with my brother. But the US gave me the environment to pull on my first strip. I never thought I\u2019d end up coaching in it. It\u2019s the passion but you find what you love and that is the shifted career.\u201d Ellis also smiled when the US captain, Alex Morgan, called her \u201c100% American\u201d \u2013 before replying: \u201cExcept in the supermarket at the candy store.\u201d The US manager admitted that Sir Alex Ferguson was one of her football heroes \u2013 and that she had a treasured photograph with the former Manchester United manager. \u201cI met him at the Fifa Ballon d\u2019Or and bumped into him in a hallway. He was super-gracious and it was a charming night. I read his books and I was all-in to hear and speak to him. I grew up as a United fan and can\u2019t speak enough about him. He got the best out of players and was ruthless at times.\u201d She speculated that Ferguson\u2019s influence may have rubbed off on Neville. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Phil on the inside, so can\u2019t talk about what he\u2019s like with his team,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he conducts himself in a great way. He seemed a real genuine person. \u201cI\u2019m sure that everybody affects and influences us. In our lives we are affected by the people we come in contact with and I\u2019m sure he has been.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
