Her latest work will air on television and initially appears different: a BBC Arena film she has made about the novelist George Eliot. The threads between Eliot and Wearing reveal themselves as you watch Everything Is Connected, however: like Wearing, Eliot was a woman who left the Midlands to pursue a life of creativity, who took a microscope to life, observing it sensitively and sharply from all perspectives. The documentary also reminds us of how contemporary Eliot\u2019s writing still is today. As an undergraduate in the late 90s, I was intimidated by the heftiness of Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss, and then floored by them. Eliot had such an acute understanding of the machinations of class and the workings of women\u2019s internal lives. She had also prevailed, despite the restrictions placed on her by society: she wasn\u2019t entitled, she wasn\u2019t a man, but she still became Queen Victoria\u2019s favourite writer. So many of her lines still feel intensely direct and relevant to me. Here\u2019s one: \u201cWhat do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?\u201d Broadcast to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Eliot\u2019s birth (and the BBC\u2019s 100 Novels That Shaped Our World season), Everything Is Connected combines footage from Eliot\u2019s long-transformed homes in Nuneaton and Coventry, and her later life in London, with a diverse cast reading and exploring her work (this includes the actors Jason Isaacs and Sheila Atim, the Wolverhampton-born writer Sathnam Sanghera, and ordinary locals of all ages). Taking its cues from the Turner prizewinner\u2019s earlier film work (like 1997\u2019s 2 into 1, in which twin boys and their mother lip-sync each other\u2019s words) it reinvents the talking heads format in a radical way. We are taught how much we have in common with the Victorian novelist\u2019s world, and the lessons Eliot still reveals to us through her work. Q&amp;A with Gillian Wearing Jude Rogers: How did this project come about? Was it personal enthusiasm? Gillian Wearing: No, I didn\u2019t know Eliot\u2019s work very well at all before doing this. Janet Lee [BBC executive producer] and Martina Hall [director] approached me in February 2018, seeing if I\u2019d like to do a biographical film on an author, and I jumped at the chance. The idea was really outside the zone of my thinking processes. I was asked to do Eliot specifically because I\u2019m from the Midlands, I think, but I found a connection with her quite quickly in her books, particularly in Middlemarch. I loved her interest in giving a voice to so many different people. I think about that a lot in my work, especially in letting people speak without judgment. What struck you most about Eliot while making the film? The extraordinary trajectory of her life. She began life as this judgmental, pious young girl who found fictional books frivolous, then met people in Coventry who had very radical ideas, which led her to leave religion behind completely. That\u2019s quite a change already. Then there was her relationship with George Henry Lewes, a married man who was her partner for 24 years. That still feels quite radical today\u2026 It did \u2013 and she faced so much criticism for it. She was very sensitive about it. She had suffered from depression, headaches and kidney stones, which were very hard to treat then, so was often in great physical pain. But she also wrote stories full of empathy and reality and anger and all the emotions you can think of. She could properly speak of life from every side. Did it help that she came from the Midlands \u2013 from outside a big city? Yes, I\u2019m sure it did. It\u2019s also a place that was changing very much at the time, and you feel those changes in small towns. Early on, the film takes us to places from Eliot\u2019s early life, such as Griff House, which is now Nuneaton\u2019s Premier Inn. The views of rolling fields Eliot once saw are now car parks. Were those journeys important to you? Yes, they changed the focus of the film. I\u2019d read Rebecca Mead\u2019s book The Road To Middlemarch [Mead is a consultant for the film, and features in it]. She writes about how the book changed her perspectives on life as she got older, and how she visited places from Eliot\u2019s life. I was interested to revisit them too, to find traces of George Eliot through the present day. I also wanted to find other connections from the present that could bring you back into Eliot\u2019s life, whether that be meeting people who had similar experiences to her, or people who were fans of her work, or people who feel very protective of her because they are from where she\u2019s from. Which encounter meant the most to you? Meeting Ahmed, the teacher from Syria who works in the Bangladesh Centre [which is housed in the building in Coventry where Eliot lived in the 1840s]. We\u2019d gone to film someone else there, but then Ahmed told us he\u2019d read George Eliot in Syria, so we filmed him too. He recalled Eliot writing about how everyone should have an education so that they could make their own decisions \u2013 that had really stayed with him. It was such a lovely moment, as it was to know that he\u2019s working in her old home, inspired by what she taught him. How did it feel making the film as a Midlander? I did feel the connections. My family are all still in Birmingham \u2013 I\u2019m the only person who came to London. Coventry I used to know too, but it\u2019s a place I hadn\u2019t really been to since my teens. Then it was a very concrete place, but unfortunately they\u2019re demolishing a lot of those beautiful brutalist buildings. I wanted to evoke something about that memory for me, though, that might not be read by anyone else, to help me connect with it. And Adrian Utley [from the band Portishead] working on the music to make it sound like it came from the 60s and 70s helped with that. As someone who has worked with film in galleries and cinemas, did you find anything daunting about working for TV? Not exactly. I knew I was asked to do the film because I was an artist, because I\u2019d give a different perspective. Also, Arena has a great history of experimental documentaries. The first I saw as a teenager had a big effect on me: it was on the song My Way [this renowned film was made by the director Nigel Finch in 1979]. It just featured lots of people singing the song, which was very simple, but I remember thinking, wow, this is quite radical. What I did find daunting, though, was trying to tell the story of an author\u2019s whole life through all of her writing. It\u2019s different to just making a film about a book. The films seem to be showing, through Eliot\u2019s writing, all the things that people have in common despite coming from different historical periods or cultural backgrounds. Was that a deliberate response to our times? Or to the Jo Cox comment that we have \u201cmore in common\u201d, in the face of Brexit and political unease? That wasn\u2019t exactly what I was thinking of, but that\u2019s a good analogy. I was trying to find connections between historical moments, too: how Eliot was a child of the Industrial Revolution, for example, while I was a child of the 70s industrial recession, and how her words still say so much to me. She understood how people were, and still are. What passage of Eliot\u2019s writing has stayed with you most? There\u2019s so many from the film. Like \u201cWhen we are young we think our troubles a mighty business\u201d, from her letter to Cara Bray [a friend]. And \u201cshe turned up her sleeves, and kissed her arms with the passionate love of life\u201d: I really love that. That [passion] is what she gave. \u2022 Everything Is Connected \u2013 George Eliot\u2019s Life is on BBC Four tonight, 9pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
