Pep Guardiola\u2019s side visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday with the gap between the two clubs now standing at 10 points after Chelsea fell to a second successive defeat that highlighted how much work Sarri has to do to turn Chelsea into credible challengers. Ahead through Ruben Loftus-Cheek\u2019s early goal, Chelsea had the perfect platform to go on and win the game but badly lost their way against a Wolves side who played with the courage, belief and flair that has been badly missing in recent weeks. The turning point was Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s equaliser, just before the hour mark, and from that moment on Chelsea never recovered. \u201cWe were suddenly another team,\u201d Sarri said. A couple of potentially critical refereeing decisions went against Chelsea \u2013 \u00c1lvaro Morata had strong claims for a penalty turned down and Willian felt he was fouled in the lead-up to Wolves\u2019 second goal \u2013 but Sarri was too disappointed with the way his players performed in the final 30 minutes to dwell on either incident. The Italian, who made five changes to his starting lineup \u2013 Loftus-Cheek, Andreas Christensen and Cesc F\u00e0bregas all made their first Premier League starts of the season \u2013 questioned his players\u2019 mentality and attitude at the end of a chastening evening. He also suggested that some members of his team have \u201ctoo much confidence\u201d. For Wolves, who came into the game on the back of a miserable run of form in which they collected only one point from a possible 18, this felt like a restorative victory. They were unrecognisable from the team that lost meekly to Huddersfield and Cardiff in their previous two matches and it turned into a special evening for one teenager in particular. Morgan Gibbs-White, aged 18, was outstanding on his full Premier League debut. Showing some lovely touches, the attacking midfielder played with a maturity beyond his years. It was his perfectly weighted pass that set up Jim\u00e9nez for the equaliser and he thoroughly deserved the standing ovation that followed when he was substituted 20 minutes from time. \u201cI think he is one of the best generation of England players for a long time,\u201d said Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo. The sight of Diogo Jota, who was Wolves\u2019 top scorer last season, wheeling away in delight after converting Matt Doherty\u2019s lovely cross completed a perfect evening for the Midlands club. Jota has not looked quite the same player this season but his first Premier League goal of the campaign should give him a huge lift, with the relief almost tangible as he celebrated in front of the euphoric Wolves supporters. Chelsea seemed shellshocked after conceding twice in four minutes. They dominated possession \u2013 Sarri\u2019s team had 70% of the ball \u2013 and registered 17 shots to their opponent\u2019s six, yet only three of those efforts were on target and that says much about the absence of a cutting edge whenever they attacked. The visitors\u2019 opening goal owed much to good fortune. Loftus-Cheek picked up possession on the left from Eden Hazard and hit a curling right-foot shot that was unlikely to trouble Rui Patr\u00edcio much until Conor Coady got in the way. Stooping to try to block the ball, the Wolves defender succeeded only in heading it beyond his own keeper and inside the near post. The goal was still credited to Loftus-Cheek, who has now scored six times in his last seven club appearances. Patr\u00edcio produced an excellent save to tip Willian\u2019s free-kick on to the bar and over and the Brazilian was denied again later in the first half when Ryan Bennett made a superbly timed tackle. Yet Wolves also signalled their intent during that opening period, especially down the left flank , where R\u00faben Vinagre delivered some dangerous crosses. Jim\u00e9nez headed one over the bar and another ended up at the feet of Gibbs-White only for F\u00e0bregas, who came into the Chelsea team for Jorginho, to make a crucial last-ditch tackle. Then came that penalty appeal straight after the restart, when Willy Boly appeared to swipe Morata\u2019s feet from under him as he tried to touch in an inviting Loftus-Cheek cross. The significance of that moment became clear little more than 10 minutes later, when Jim\u00e9nez ran on to Gibbs-White\u2019s pass and drilled a low shot that seemed almost to go through Kepa Arrizabalaga in the Chelsea goal. In the blink of an eye Wolves had a second after Jo\u00e3o Moutinho dispossessed Willian deep inside the Chelsea half before releasing Doherty on the right. Jota dispatched the Irishman\u2019s cross and Wolves were in dreamland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
