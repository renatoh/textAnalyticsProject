The \u201cgreat October\u201d marking the events of 1917 used to be commemorated every year on 7 November, thanks to a quirk of chronology dating back centuries. This was not lost on the locals, with their well developed sense of irony: even the calendar was against them. Of course, 1917 was not the only November revolution that upended the region. Another uprising 30 years ago this weekend upstaged the Bolshevik festivities and steered a swathe of eastern Europe on to a new course. But for better or worse? Much has been made of the disillusionment gripping the region, but as our central and eastern European correspondent, Shaun Walker, found out, in countries such as Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, people have never had it so good. The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 was perhaps the most Upsidey revolution in history. If you\u2019re not convinced, perhaps these before and after images from Berlin will change your mind. Otherwise, our work was eclectic this week, demonstrating either great breadth of vision or some rather scattergun editing. You decide which. Money and maps: how to save the Amazon? (four-minute read) The book lenders of Kabul (two-minute read) A bubble barrier to clear waterways of plastic (one-minute read) An art project to photograph all 76,000 year 3 pupils in London (three-minute read) Italy to make the climate crisis a compulsory subject in schools (due minuti per leggere) Microsoft Japan discovers the benefits of the four-day week (very short) Lucky numbers Europeans are more satisfied with their lot than they were in 2013, despite the political and social turbulence of the past five years. The number of sick days taken by British workers has fallen dramatically since the mid-1990s. The UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions intensity (a measure of emissions relative to economic output) has fallen by 66% since 1990. What we liked The molecule that could transform solar energy, courtesy of Adam Popescu at Bloomberg. Chemistry has never been so interesting\u2026 Also, we loved this piece in the New York Times by an old friend of the Upside, Jonathan Rowson, on whether we really need to pursue happiness at all. Happiness is fine as a side-effect, but it\u2019s a cruel demand (Adam Phillips) What we heard Tony Guilmette responded to the Amazon rainforest story: I was wondering if you could cover the topic of the destruction of the Amazon as it pertains to Ecuador. Thanks in advance. Worth investigating, though not perhaps as part of the Upside, Tony. Francisco S\u00e1nchez Molina wrote in from Helsinki: Warm greetings from the Wolf Action Group in Helsinki, Finland. We are a small NGO that works on sharing science-based information about the wolf as a social and family-oriented animal in order to influence attitudes and reduce unnecessary fear and hatred towards wolves. We are writing to you to propose that the Guardian\u2019s The Upside could write about the topic of wolf hate in Finland. In this otherwise peaceful, uncorrupted and well-educated country, poaching is the biggest cause of wolf mortality. Even though wolves are strictly protected by European law and Finland promotes itself as a destination for lovers of nature and the great outdoors, wolves are being legally hunted down. In fact, Finland was recently taken to the European court of justice over the way its authorities seem to easily hand out wolf-killing permits without sufficiently justifying their decisions. The present situation for the wolves in Finland is so severe that if public opinion doesn\u2019t change, Finland could be left with no wolves at all. Where was the Upside?
