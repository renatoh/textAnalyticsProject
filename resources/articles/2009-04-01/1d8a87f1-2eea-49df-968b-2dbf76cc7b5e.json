The game shows that some form of civil society exists even in these ruined, drug-ravaged estates, and Herc and Carv are as taken aback as we are: \"Projects got a ball team?\" asks Carv. As the two callow officers watch the game through the fence, they enjoy a friendly chat with drug dealers Poot and Bodie, again presented more like competing colleagues than enemies. But earlier, as they surveyed the empty streets, wondering where everyone had got to, Herc had mused: \"Maybe we won.\" It was a telling comment, reflecting the idea that winning the war on drugs would mean the population of the Baltimore projects disappearing completely, the idea that the police were at war not with specific criminal gangs but with whole areas of the city. The interaction between Prop Joe and Avon strikes some similarly unexpected notes. The two drug lords engage in a lot of aggressive banter, Avon mocking Joe's suit and clipboard (\"Look the part, be the part, motherfucker,\" replies Joe), and threatening to \"light Joe's ass up\" if he ever comes west \"without a ball\". But Barksdale calls him \"baby\" throughout, his enemy seems unruffled, and later Joe paints a picture suggestive of mutual respect between professional rivals: \"We talk now and then. I page his ass.\" Yet he seems happy to give up Avon's pager number to Omar, surely knowing what Omar plans to do with it. Instead of \"giving a fuck when it's not his turn\", McNulty actually seems reluctant to give a fuck at all this episode, refusing to go out with Lieutenant Daniels to get a first look at Avon. He seems ridiculous and overly didactic as he intones: \"We get him by voice alone or we don't get him.\" The script (by David H Melnick and Shamit Choksey) tries hard to prove him right \u2013 Sydnor accompanies Daniels and is therefore absent from his post at a key moment \u2013 but I'm not convinced. Knowing what Avon looks like has got to be helpful to the police hoping to arrest him, surely? They seem desperate to know what the Greek looks like in series two. Still on Avon, in this episode Freamon estimates his income at $20-25m a year. \"Where does it all go?\" asks Daniels. In light of our previous conversations about the relative merits of Avon and his lieutenant, Stringer Bell, Freamon's answer is illuminating, and surely suggests that the secret of Barksdale and Bell's success lies partly in a mixture of Avon's natural caution with Stringer's business acumen: \"He [Avon] shows no flash. He's got no house, no car in his name, no jewellery, no clothes. Just front companies and the property \u2013 and political contributions, $75,000 in the last month alone.\" It's an incredible \u2013 even shocking \u2013 amount of money, and probably worth remembering in series three when Stringer is arguing that he and Avon should leave the drugs game behind and turn all their attention to legitimate property speculation. Avon, of course, is uninterested. Did he foresee the credit crunch? Running totals: Murders: Stilll on six. Unless you count the murdering of Avon's reputation as a basketball coach. Four years in a row he's lost against Joe! Time for the west side to consider taking up a different sport? Omar stick-ups: Four. Up one \u2013 a very easy one. Omar walks into the low-rises, minor dealers scattering before him in all directions, stands outside a flat with his back to it, and tells the occupants: \"You all need to open this door now before I huff and puff.\" Out of pure fear, they throw down a massive package to the big bad wolf without anyone firing a shot. They've got the right idea. Herc fuck-ups: up by half a point to four-and-a-half. It's unclear whether it was him or Carver who lost $7,000 of seized drug money and led Daniels to believe they had stolen it. They both look like numbskulls in this episode. McNulty \"giving a fuck when it wasn't his turn\": Six. No change (see above). Drunken McNulty: Five. No change. Another surprisingly sober day for Jimmy. (Bunk still on two). McNulty school of parenting: Still on two also"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
