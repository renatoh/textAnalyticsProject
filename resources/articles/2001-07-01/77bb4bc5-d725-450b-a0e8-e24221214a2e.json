Baltacha, the daughter of a former Soviet international footballer and a pentathlete, recovered from within two points of a straight-sets defeat to win 3-6, 7-6, 6-3 against the 11th-seeded Croatian Matea Mezak, and Keothavong, whose parents escaped Laos two decades ago, caused an upset by bringing down the fifth-seeded Czech Eva Birnerova 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. It was a tenacious and thoughtful effort by Keothavong against an uninhibited opponent who bombarded her relentlessly with ferocious first serves and fierce drives from both wings and whom she eventually lured into errors. And it was a brave performance by Baltacha, who is suffering from an injury and yet escaped from trouble against a highly promising 16-year-old. \"Bally has now beaten three good young players even though she has had a foot problem and would have preferred to have a couple of days away from the court,\" said Alan Jones, who is coach to both British teenagers. \"She is having a lot of matches and that's taking a toll. She won this match mentally as much as physically. \"They're both learning that they're on course. But if the WTA were to relax its rules [on age] there would be a huge surge of players between 15 and 17 years old who would go pole-axing into the world rankings between 150 and 300. Both Elena and Anne have come straight from playing seniors and have had to get stuck into playing juniors, which is not easy.\" Jones added: \"Anne has improved her footwork and got to balls she would never have reached a year ago. It was not easy to play someone threatening to pulverise your second serve like that and it was a great win.\" Keothavong's recovery after losing the first set began when she got a break early in the second. \"I was pleased with that because it was difficult to get any sort of rhythm when she was whacking it so hard,\" she said. She struggled to hold on to it at 4-2 and failed to serve out for the set at 5-4, but broke back at once on the third deuce with a nicely angled return which created an opening for a wonderful topspin backhand cross-court winner. Keothavong was then twice a break down in the decider and saved two points to go 4-5 down, with Birnerova to serve for the match, before producing a series of good deep returns in the next game which caused her opponent to self-destruct. Baltacha had to survive an even harder crisis at six-all in the second-set tie-break. She escaped by using her biggest weapon, a forehand drive, to launch a cross-court winner and then sneaked the set with a foray to the net. In the decider she gained a break and then lost it, but regained the advantage for 4-2 and 5-2 before serving out to win the match for the loss of only one point. \"I had to do a lot of work to get there and I was very pleased,\" she said. Jones was cautious about these triumphs. \"These two are not like Tim Henman or Venus Williams,\" he warned. \"But they have their own character and if they carry on like this the British public will see two players who are fresh and have promise. I am excited that after a long time I have a job to do again where tennis is the main issue.\" Baltacha and Keothavong may, however, struggle to make further progress. Baltacha next plays Svetlana Kuznetsova, the fourth-seeded Russian who has yet to drop a set, while Keothavong meets Anna Bastrikova, who caused the biggest upset in the event so far by overcoming her fellow Russian Nina Brattchikova. Meanwhile Ken Skupski, the sole surviving British boy, also reached the last eight with a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 win over Sunil Sipaeya of India. The 17-year-old will next play Philipp Petzschner, of Germany."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
