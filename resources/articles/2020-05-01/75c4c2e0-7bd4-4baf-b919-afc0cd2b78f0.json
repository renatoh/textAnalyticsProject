Top stories Leading health professionals have written to the Morrison government calling for a new generation of environment laws in the wake of the Covid-19 and bushfire crises. The Nobel prize-winning immunologist Peter Doherty and the epidemiologist and former Australian of the Year Fiona Stanley are among 180 professionals warning that public health will suffer unless action is taken to strengthen environmental protections. A new poll has revealed that six out of 10 voters in Eden-Monaro don\u2019t believe the Coalition is doing enough to tackle climate change. The Liberals\u2019 byelection campaign in the electorate kicked off on Sunday as their newly preselected candidate, Dr Fiona Kotvojs, emphasised her green credentials by saying she had solar panels on her house and believed \u201cthat humans contribute to that changing climate\u201d. Australia\u2019s universities are in for a \u201cworld of pain financially\u201d if borders are not opened to international students, the chancellor of the University of Queensland, Peter Varghese, has told Guardian Australia. Varghese said universities across the sector would face severe funding shortfalls if the lucrative foreign student market could not be quickly revived. Universities have outlined \u201csafe corridor\u201d plans that would allow international students from \u201csafe\u201d countries to return as long as they were subjected to a self-funded quarantine period. One in three students at the University of Queensland are from overseas. The political fallout from the UK\u2019s erratically managed Covid-19 response continues, with Boris Johnson\u2019s closest aide, Dominic Cummings, facing calls to resign for flouting lockdown regulations. Cummings, who is thought to have been behind the UK\u2019s controversial \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy, visited his parents in the north-east of England, more than 260 miles from London, while he had coronavirus symptoms. In an extraordinary press conference on Sunday, Johnson gave Cummings his complete backing, saying he \u201cacted responsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. This view wasn\u2019t shared by the UK civil service (or much of Britain), whose usually sober Twitter account tweeted: \u201cArrogant and offensive. Can you imagine having to work with these truth twisters?\u201d The tweet has now been deleted. Australia The actor Claudia Karvan has joined a campaign in the the small south coast town of Manyana to save its only significant unburnt piece of bushland from development. Manyana residents are calling on the state government to buy the land and turn it into a nature reserve. The Labor senator Penny Wong has urged Scott Morrison to confront Donald Trump about concerns the US-China trade deal is hurting Australian agriculture. The push comes as Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, urges Victoria to think twice about potential projects under China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. Western Australia is experiencing a \u201conce-in-a-decade\u201d storm, with the entire coast to be hit by ex-Tropical Cyclone Mangga. The storm is expected to bring 100km/h winds, heavy rain and massive waves along a 3,000km stretch of coast. The world The New York Times has covered its front page with the names people who have died from coronavirus. As the death toll in the US nears 100,000 the Times describes the deaths as \u201can incalculable loss\u201d. A former state epidemiologist in Sweden has said the country\u2019s relaxed approach to the coronavirus is wrong. Annika Linde, who oversaw Sweden\u2019s response to swine flu and Sars, says Sweden has failed vulnerable people. The Wuhan lab close to the heart of the Covid-19 outbreak has said it was working on three live strains of bat coronavirus but none match the one that caused the pandemic. Wang Yanyi, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said the closest genetic match to the virus spreading around the world was only 79.8%. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, was branded a \u201ckiller\u201d by his opponents as he popped out for a Saturday night hot dog on the day a 965 of his citizens were reported to have died from Covid-19. Recommended reads Complacency about coronavirus could be Australia\u2019s downfall, as the country starts to believe it has put the pandemic behind it, writes Jason Wilson. Australia\u2019s experience of the virus has been shaped by some enduring national attributes, he argues. \u201cOne is the tendency to misrecognise miraculous good fortune as good management, and an associated weakness for self-congratulation.\u201d Luke Henrique-Gomes talks to Australia\u2019s new mental health officer, Dr Ruth Vine. Vine strikes a cautionary note when asked about a study that warned of a 25% increase in suicide linked to Covid-19. \u201cI\u2019m aware of it, I think it\u2019s interesting, but I just think it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d She suggests it is too early to say what impact the pandemic will have on Australians\u2019 mental health. \u201cWe can say people are more worried, because there are so many uncertainties. We love to know stuff, we love to feel we are being fully informed. We don\u2019t like surprises. That\u2019s been a real problem during the pandemic.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. The Covidsafe app was touted as a vital part of the Covid-19 response but has only identified one infected person using its data. \u201cThis is an important protection for a Covid-safe Australia,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said in late April. \u201cI would liken it to the fact that if you want to go outside when the sun is shining, you have got to put sunscreen on.\u201d Josh Taylor asks how the app went from being the key to allowing Australians to get back to the footy to being barely relevant. Listen In today\u2019s episode of the Full Story podcast Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, talks to our environment editor, Adam Morton, about Australia\u2019s muddled energy policy. It\u2019s a huge week for the future of renewables and Murphy asks why Australia appears to be making an energy roadmap without a destination. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.
