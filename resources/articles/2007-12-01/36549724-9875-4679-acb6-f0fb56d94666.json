Her arrival in Tel Aviv last week, announced by the Jewish Agency that encourages immigration to Israel, has seen Reinhardt lionised by the Israeli media and attaining an instant celebrity that has bewildered her, according to her son Sacha, but which she says the flamboyant Oskar Schindler himself would have thoroughly enjoyed. Speaking to The Observer last week from a hotel in Tel Aviv, where she plans to settle in sheltered accommodation close to her son and his family, Oskar Schindler's sometime secretary recalled the genesis of the list that would save so many lives, and her own part in it. 'I had been picked up in Krakow [where Schindler's factory was] for being a Jew and sent to Plaszow concentration camp, commanded by the notorious SS officer Amon Goeth. Schindler hired people from the camp to work in his factory. Speaking perfect German, and being able to write shorthand, had already proved her salvation in the slave labour battalions. 'My mother had insisted that I learn something useful, so I learnt to type. In the camp there were not so many people who spoke German and could do shorthand and type, so I was put into the administrative barracks. 'When the Germans came with Schindler's list of the workers that he wanted to take to Sudetenland [western Czechoslovakia] it was given to me to note and type up.' That list was the group who came to be known as Schindler's Jews, 1,300 or so individuals that at first perhaps for financial motives, but later for increasingly humanitarian reasons, Schindler would defend with his often aggressive charm against the SS, sheltering them first in his enamel wares factory in Krakow, then, as the Russian front advanced, in a factory in Sudetenland making bullets. It was at this moment that Schindler and his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern, who had helped to motivate Schindler, prepared the 'list' of essential workers - all of them Jews - for relocation to his new factory. 'I was given the list to type up,' recalled Reinhardt last week. 'And when I typed it up I put my name and the name of two friends on it to make up the quota.' In doing so amid the accelerated extermination of Poland's Jews that was under way in 1944, she almost certainly saved all their lives. A perilous journey, including a stop-off in Auschwitz, followed before Schindler's Jews made it to his new factory in Brunnlitz. There, despite reservations about being in the office of the womanising and hard-drinking Schindler, Reinhardt was persuaded to work for him. She met Schindler only once after the war. 'It must have been around 1953. I had gone to Vienna and I was walking along a street with an uncle. We were passing a coffee house where there was a group of people sitting. This large man ran across and hugged and started kissing me, saying: \"Mimi, Mimi...\" It was then that I realised that it was Schindler sitting with some of the Jews he had rescued.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
