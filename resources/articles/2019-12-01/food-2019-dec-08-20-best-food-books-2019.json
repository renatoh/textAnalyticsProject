A masterwork to be measured next to the best of Claudia Roden, by a skilled cook and writer immersed in the food and region. I have toyed over the years with paying mad money for a copy of the original 2001 edition (I still might if I had any relatives to leave me money), but this retested, revised, refined edition is \u2013 whisper it \u2013 maybe more accomplished. A book to be kept near the cooker, to be splattered in red oil. AJ Buy it for: adventurous cooks The Book of St John By Fergus Henderson &amp; Trevor Gulliver Latest addition to the St John collection, with more than 100 new recipes to mark its 25th anniversary. Who else will wax lyrical about brains (\u201ca wonder, fluffy clouds of joy\u201d), pluck (\u201cthe measure of an animal\u2019s life\u201d) and tongue (\u201cthe most well-behaved of the organs\u201d)? A celebration of comfort food in its finest sense with a strong section on puddings. Worthy of its legacy. AJ Buy it for: committed carnivores Taverna By Georgina Hayden Hayden\u2019s love for Greek Cypriot cooking and flavours was not formed in the sun-drenched Med but in her grandparents\u2019 restaurant in north London. Here she shares the recipes she grew up preparing and eating. Some come from family members, others are Hayden\u2019s own interpretation, all have been adapted for the British home cook. MT-H Buy it for: the irresistible orange, yogurt and filo cake, portokalopita Be My Guest By Priya Basil A powerful meditation on hospitality which moves between the author\u2019s Indian heritage, upbringing in Kenya and present-day life in Germany. Hospitality, says Basil, can reveal, \u201cthe true topography of a society, its landscape of reciprocity, its borders of give and take\u201d. Packed with such brilliance, whether pondering family, food waste or the basic idea of recipes, which \u201crepresent one of the easiest, most generous forms of exchange between people and cultures\u201d. GG Buy it for: your next dinner party We Are the Weather By Jonathan Safran Foer Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast is the subtitle of Foer\u2019s book on the climate crisis, with food being a way, he argues, that individuals might help with a situation that is undeniably universal but can feel oddly impersonal. He calls that sensation \u201cfatigue of the imagination\u201d and much of the book is spent wrestling with it. It helps that he puts his own flaws out front, acknowledging that though he no longer eats meat he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine a future in which I don\u2019t want to\u201d. GG Buy it for: lowering your carbon emissions Greenfeast Spring, Summer and Autumn, Winter By Nigel Slater Two compact volumes of seasonal, fuss-free, meat-free recipes. \u201cNot strictly vegetarian\u201d, according to the Observer\u2019s cookery writer, everything here twins ease of use with deliciousness. Dishes are designed to be mixed and matched and there\u2019s delight in sympathetic ingredients, whether that\u2019s a warming bowl of shiitake mushrooms and soba noodles, or an indulgent treat of chocolate, dulce de leche and cantucci. GG Buy it for: the flexitarian in your life Nothing Fancy By Alison Roman This is not a book about \u201centertaining\u201d, folding napkins or the like, but one of accessible, delicious recipes and simple tips to take the stress out of cooking. Skip to the snacks for Roman\u2019s coveted labneh with sizzled spring onion and chilli aka \u201cThe Dip\u201d; not forgetting her perfect herby salad and the revelation that serving baked potatoes at a dinner party is a brilliant and sensible idea. MT-H Buy it for: the \u201covernight focaccia, tonight\u201d The Quality Chop House By William Lander, Daniel Morgenthau and Sean Searley Some books are worth waiting for. Perhaps not the 150 years that there has been something to eat on its Farringdon Road site, but QCH is a proper restaurant and this is its proper cookbook. As carefully put together as the Chop House wine list, all the good things are here: the mince on dripping toast, the confit potatoes. As handsomely presented as you\u2019d expect. AJ Buy it for: someone who loves to entertain Sardine: Simple Seasonal Proven\u00e7al Cooking By Alex Jackson The cookbook of the small Old Street restaurant of the same name. Yes, the cooking of the south of France has been well \u2013 and beautifully \u2013 trawled by some of our favourite food writers, the likes of Elizabeth David, Alice Waters and Richard Olney. But this is a quietly compelling work that makes its own case for inclusion. Jackson is a talented writer and cook with an inquisitive mind who wears his knowledge lightly. AJ Buy it for: the terrific chocolate, hazelnut and pear tart Mandalay: Recipes and Tales From a Burmese Kitchen By MiMi Aye This will likely be an introduction for many to an underappreciated cuisine, partly because of the politics of the place. Worry not, you are in excellent hands. Aye is a gifted recipe writer and opinionated champion of the food of her family (see, for instance, the short section on \u201cWhy MSG is A-OK\u201d). This is a book to read as well as cook from, packed with evocative imagery. AJ Buy it for: the fish noodle soup, stay for the duck egg curry From the Oven to the Table By Diana Henry There\u2019s so much to love about the latest from the Sunday Telegraph writer. Although subtitled Simple Dishes That Look After Themselves, don\u2019t be lulled into thinking there isn\u2019t a keen and current cooking brain creating these recipes (roast cabbage and XO crumb, anyone?). Its great strength lies in updating and upgrading food you\u2019ll want to produce with a flourish. Deliciously photographed, too. AJ Buy it for: turning a meal into a special occasion Pasta Grannies By Vicky Bennison It\u2019s no secret that Nonna\u2019s cooking is best. And now the wisdom and recipes from Tuscany, Puglia and Sardinia\u2019s finest home cooks are all in one place. From 79-year-old Vanda\u2019s tagliolini with shrimp to 97-year-old Giuseppa\u2019s fingernail pasta with tomato sauce, there is enough pasta inspiration here to last until you, too, can cook as well as an Italian grandmother. MT-H Buy it for: the stories behind the nonnas\u2019 most treasured dishes Zaika: Vegan Recipes from India By Romy Gill Saturated in memories of a happy Bengali childhood, infused with a subtle hint of sadness at her much-loved mother\u2019s recent death, this is Bristol-based chef Romy Gill\u2019s first book. Centring on vegan dishes because it is the food she grew up with, it would be easy to think you might live well eating and cooking from here. Dishes that caught our eye: the roti, the saag and her famous samosas. AJ Buy it for: its clarity and its evocation of love My Last Supper By Jay Rayner Why wait, asks OFM columnist Rayner, why not eat your last meal right now, when there\u2019s time to enjoy it? You can always take stock of your life so far, as he does in this left-field memoir, with dishes and ingredients a chance to reminisce \u2013 the excellent chapter on salads takes in a teenage drug-bust that makes the national press. There\u2019s plenty of professional wisdom, too, including an explanation of why, if a restaurant\u2019s chips are good, the rest of the menu probably will be too. GG Buy it for: someone who plans every meal, no matter how far ahead The Whole Fish Cookbook By Josh Niland Subtitled New Ways to Cook, Eat and Think, and for once this doesn\u2019t feel like hyperbole. There is a clear idea captured here that runs through these pages like, well, a fish backbone: that we don\u2019t treat food from the sea in the way we should; that something akin to \u201cnose to tail\u201d eating is called for because of deliciousness and respect. There are smart thoughts here on dry-ageing, curing and butchery, a whole \u201cfabulous fish philosophy\u201d. A bit cheffy sometimes, but an important book. AJ Buy it for: someone with an open mind and a sharp knife Tartine: A Classic Revisited By Elisabeth Prueitt &amp; Chad Robertson Along with Tartine Bread, this is one of the more influential baking books of recent times, the titular San Francisco bakery inspiring similar operations around the world. Like their work, this updated version is precise and beautiful, with 68 new recipes, tweaks to 55 old favourites, plus exceptional new photography. Now you don\u2019t need to travel halfway round the world to eat their morning buns. GG Buy it for: patisserie fiends Eat Run Enjoy By Billy White Requiring serious training, many hours on your feet, with no guarantee of success \u2013 endurance running and high-end cooking are similar, says Stockholm-based British chef White. And he should know. He excels at both, though you don\u2019t need run 100-mile trails to appreciate his food here. Packed with delicious nutritious meals, snacks and staples, plus inspirational interviews with other long-distance runners. AJ Buy it for: someone who might like encouragement to exercise Midnight Chicken and Other Recipes Worth Living For By Ella Risbridger A mix of recipes, love story and memoir, Midnight Chicken is powered by Risbridger\u2019s depression and her boyfriend\u2019s death from cancer, just as she was finishing this book. \u201cI wrote it in part to keep our world alive even if he couldn\u2019t be,\u201d she says of a collection that neatly explains how cooking knits itself into the day-to-day business of living. GG Buy it for: comfort (and the recipe for midnight chicken itself) Hungry By Jeff Gordinier Few people have spent as much time with Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, the chef behind Copenhagen\u2019s Noma, as Gordinier, food editor of US Esquire . Here he tags along during a time of great change, Redzepi temporarily decamping to Mexico then revolutionising his approach to cooking all over again when opening Noma 2.0. Along the way, Gordinier locates what makes the world\u2019s greatest cook tick. First there\u2019s his outsider status as an immigrant from Macedonia. Then there\u2019s his almost pathological curiosity, shared by the international crew of talent he gathers around him, all bound together by his ethos: \u201ckeep moving\u201d. GG Buy it for: anyone who dreams big in the kitchen East By Meera Sodha One hundred and twenty fantastic dishes from purple sprouting broccoli pad thai to paneer, tomato and kale saag, plus lots of ways to make tofu taste good. Some recipes are from Sodha\u2019s vegan column in the Guardian, others, new. Traversing not just the culinary domain of her own heritage, Sodha finds inspiration in vegan dishes from other parts of Asia too, describing the restrictions of her column as a \u201ccatalyst for creativity\u201d.
