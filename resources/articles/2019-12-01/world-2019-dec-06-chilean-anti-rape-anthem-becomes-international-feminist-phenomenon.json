Un Violador en Tu Camino \u2013 A Rapist in Your Path \u2013 was first performed in late November as Chile\u2019s nationwide uprising against social inequality pushed into its second month. Videos of the song \u2013 and its accompanying dance moves \u2013 quickly went viral, spreading across Latin America and the world, with performances taking place in Mexico, Colombia, France, Spain and the UK. The song was written by Lastesis, a feminist theatre group based in the city of Valpara\u00edso, who credited Chile\u2019s women protesters for helping spread the work around the world. \u201cIt was never intended to be a protest song \u2013 the women of the marches transformed it into something more\u201d said Paula Cometa, speaking on behalf of the group, whose other members are Sibila Sotomayor, Daffne Vald\u00e9s, and Lea C\u00e1ceres. A Rapist in Your Path is based on the work of the Argentinian theorist Rita Segato, who argues that sexual violence is a political problem, not a moral one. The lyrics describe how institutions \u2013 the police, the judiciary and political power structures \u2013 uphold systematic violations of women\u2019s rights: \u201cThe rapist is you/ It\u2019s the cops/ The judges/ The state/ The president.\u201d Another section repudiates the many ways that women are blamed for falling victim to sexual violence (\u201cAnd it\u2019s not my fault / nor where I was / nor what I wore\u201d) before concluding: \u201cThe rapist is you.\u201d According to statistics compiled by the Chilean Network Against Violence Against Women, 42 cases of sexual abuse are reported each day to the police (approximately two every hour). In 2018, only 25.7% of sexual abuse cases resulted in judicial rulings. \u201cIn the Chilean judicial system, stereotypes and biases harm women victims of sexual violence,\u201d said B\u00e1rbara Sep\u00falveda Hales, spokeswoman for the feminist lawyer group Abofem. \u201cIn many trials, the life and sexual behavior of the victim is exposed as if it were a justification for the aggression they suffered.\u201d Although the song was written before the wave of unrest and repression erupted in October, Cometa said that the choreography reflects the crisis in which security forces have faced widespread allegations of rape, torture and shooting to kill. \u201cIt adapted to the moment that we are now living in Chile. The violence and the human rights violations that women have been exposed to recently,\u2019\u2019 she said. In one part of the song, performers squat down in an echo of a position which female protesters are forced to assume on arrest. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple form of torture and punishment carried out by the Chilean police,\u201d Cometa said. Chile\u2019s largest performance of the song took place on Thursday night outside Santiago\u2019s National Stadium \u2013 which became notorious as a prison camp and torture centre after the 1973 military coup which brought Augusto Pinochet to power. An official report on human rights during the dictatorship found that almost every one of the female victims interviewed had suffered some form of sexual violence. Thursday\u2019s performance brought together thousands of women, including older chilenas who lived through the dictatorship and their younger counterparts protesting today. \u201cThey held prisoners here, women who were harassed and sexually tortured,\u201d said Victoria Gallardo, 71, who was participating in the event. \u201cI cried the first time I heard Un Violador en Tu Camino. I\u2019m so proud of the young women of today \u2013 and this performance represents us all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
