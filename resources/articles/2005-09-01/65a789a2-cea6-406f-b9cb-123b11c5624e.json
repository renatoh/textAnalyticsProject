They wait half a century to win the league, do so in some style, and are promptly informed they've ruined the game. Last season, Arsenal put together an unbeaten run and were hailed as the The Incredibles. This season Chelsea compile a better record and are called The Intolerables. It is a thin line between success and success. Football, meanwhile, is a victim of its own excess. The extent of the malaise illustrated by the fact that adherents had to point to the Carling Cup second round to show the game was in rude health. Which is rather like a supporter of the British Empire muttering 'Gibraltar' into his brandy. The majority, however, feel the game is ailing. So ill, indeed, as to be almost unwatchable. Was it possible to stay awake for an entire Chelsea match? I resolved to do my best. The opening five minutes were quiet, dangerously quiet. The game looked very 1-0. On seven minutes Michael Essien stampeded through on the right and Thomas Sorensen nearly fumbled an easy save. On nine minutes nifty work from Arjen Robben set up a rather hesitant Frank Lampard. Time passed. Robben was booked for diving. Jose Mourinho took to his feet and stayed there, perhaps he too was having difficulty staying awake. His system was so nearly right, but whatever was slightly wrong was sufficient to make it malfunction. And the suspicion was that the flaw in the machine was Lampard. Passes are going awry, runs are being mistimed, fatherhood has unbalanced him. When Aston Villa attacked, which was rarely, they were offside. Your correspondent was then nearly hit on the head by a miscued clearance. Just the jolt that was needed to make it through the tricky half-hour mark. Ricardo Carvalho to Hernan Crespo to Damien Duff. A extraordinary one-touch move conducted at such pace that the deftness of the artistry on show was disguised. But the shot went wide. John Terry might have had a penalty. The home crowd awoke to shout abuse at referee Barry Knight. It was like a football match again. More poor refereeing and this staying awake would be a doddle. Maybe that's what the game needs - a bunch of David Ellerays. What it got, and this was even more astonishing, was a goal from Luke Moore, who snaked through a sleeping Chelsea central defence and wriggled the ball past Petr Cech. What a sharpener. It certainly had an effect on Lampard, who had obviously decided to wait for someone to score against his team before deigning to start his season. In the 45th minute he was curling a free-kick into the net. And he should have made it two in the two minutes of added time but duffed his volley wide. After the goal-caffeine-nicotine rush the second half did not appear to present a problem. William Gallas should have scored early on. Juan Pablo Angel might have taken advantage of sloppy Chelsea defending. By replacing Carvalho with Shaun Wright-Philips and asking Essien to fill in as an ultra attacking left-back, Mourinho opened the game up. The gamble nearly paid off when Didier Drogba headed just over and, with the cards re-jigged, Chelsea were electrifying. Duff had an effort palmed over. The indomitable Essien popped up everywhere. Their efforts were rewarded with a penalty after Olof Mellberg fouled Drogba. Lampard scored. And for the rest of the match Chelsea played high-tempo perfect pitch football. The gap at the top is bigger than ever and the top team have found their rhythm. It might be predictable, but it isn't boring. Man of the match: Michael Essien - Indomitable in any position. Better for this team than Gerrard"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
