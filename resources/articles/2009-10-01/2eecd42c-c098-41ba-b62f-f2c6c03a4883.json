The feverish speculation around the appointments of a new chairman and chief executive has gone eerily quiet \u2013 understandably, as ITV is desperate to avoid any more farcical situations of the sort that have dogged its quest to fill the leadership vacuum. One new name being touted for chairman is former Bank of England deputy governor Sir David Clementi, who is said to have nipped out of a posh City dinner to vote in Pop Idol a few years ago. That might be an urban myth, but he would be a good choice: ITV urgently needs to improve its poor corporate governance, strengthen its board and repair relationships with shareholders. Clementi, who proved his mettle as chairman of the Prudential, would be amply equipped to do all of those things. Sir Christopher Bland, who sorted out an enormous mess at BT, would be an equally credible candidate. ITV need not be a basket case if it recruits the right top team. It went down the razzmatazz route with the likeable and charismatic Grade, but in this chastened climate, it needs a boardroom heavyweight in the chair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
