One very effective way for a manager to continue their development is to identify a mentor. A management mentor is a guide, someone with greater experience and the wisdom that comes with it and someone who can offer impartial advice and support. Many senior managers find their own mentor, often outside their own organisation; it may be someone they met at a conference or someone they know from a previous job, whose judgment they respect, trust and have developed a rapport with. Often they are in a different but related area of work. In Lancashire county council, all the managers who had benefited from executive coaching were expected to offer themselves as mentors. Surprisingly, some senior managers expressed doubts about their skills for the role and concerns that mentees may have unrealistic expectations. Were these genuine concerns or just a reluctance to take on an additional role? We offered a one-day workshop to managers who wished to be mentors and produced guidance for both mentors and mentees, which covered confidentiality, frequency of meetings and dealing with what happens when the relationship draws to a close. The guidance made it clear that the onus was on the mentee to come to sessions with a live issue to discuss as opposed to the typical line management supervision session where the manager takes the lead in determining the discussion. We decided that the introduction of a mentoring system was more likely to succeed if mentors were volunteers. Early on it became clear that mentors and mentees had very different views on the type of structure they would like. Mentors wanted things kept relatively informal while mentees wanted detailed guidance. Mentors were relatively relaxed about the matching process: \"If someone wants me to mentor them I will. If it doesn't work out we will agree it isn't working and call it a day\". Mentees had grander expectations; they seemed to see it more as a dating agency and were happy to fill in a lengthy questionnaire about their experience and what they wanted to get out the relationship. Mentors on the other hand were reluctant to complete any forms. As one mentor said: \"It doesn't really matter what posts I have held, I am not offering professional supervision but the benefit of my experience as a senior manager\" Starting a mentoring relationship A mentoring relationship often starts with a request for advice and help around career development. So we suggested that initial sessions could start with revising the mentees CV and subsequent sessions could involve preparing for an interview. To help mentees the guidance provided covered suggestions for topics like managing your manager, conversations you can't have with your line manager and beneficial conversations with impartial people who have dealt with the same issues. Mentoring provided the individual with the opportunity to discuss a live issue in a safe environment and to use this to explore options and what type of manager they want to be. Those senior managers who became mentors reported back that they found it a rewarding experience. Not all senior managers wanted to be mentors and not all senior managers good mentors. Many organisations recognise the value of mentoring particularly for newly appointed and inexperienced managers but some of the best mentors are first line or middle managers. These are usually people who have been around for some time, are content to have found their place in the hierarchy, are not competing for promotion but want to put their experience to greatest effect by channelling their energies into encouraging others. The best mentoring schemes tap into this reservoir of experience, allowing people to focus their energies into areas where their wisdom will benefit less experienced managers and in so doing give them the opportunity to leave a legacy in the form of helping, supporting and inspiring the next generation of managers.
