I like it because it's basically like me: past its best, with various bits starting to clap out, but still goes too fast for its own good, and drinks too much. My wife likes it, too - she calls it the 'stealth car'. It's bottle green and completely unobtrusive, so nobody pays attention to you at all. But it's really a wolf in sheep's clothing. It takes skill and restraint to drive this car slowly, as slight pressure on the throttle kicks in the turbo and off you go, flying along like a rocket. The mid-range acceleration is very fast, even with the automatic transmission. It has 220,000 miles on the clock and the engine makes a lot of strange moaning noises when it's idling, but the faster you go the quieter it gets. And the body and suspension are still very taut - there are no rattles or shakes, whatever the road surface. My Saab is the hatchback version and we use it for all sorts of jobs: ferrying the children and their friends, carrying giant Christmas trees, or loading it full of garden waste to go to the dump. Sadly, some of the useful peripherals - like the climate control - have given up the ghost, but the kids like it for the heated front passenger seat. \u00b7 Love your car?
