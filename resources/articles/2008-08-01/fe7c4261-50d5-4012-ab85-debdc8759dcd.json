Staff working with prisoners at a jail in mid-Wales, who asked to remain anonymous, have told their union that they have uncovered cases of prisoners released on the scheme who deliberately breached their release conditions after buying drugs ordered by inmates. When recalled, the prisoners smuggled the drugs into jail and sold them to inmates. The claims come at a sensitive time for the Ministry of Justice. It has pledged to tackle the problem of drugs in jails, but prison staff report that substance abuse is rife behind bars. Earlier this year Glynn Travis, assistant general secretary of the Prison Officers' Association, warned that drugs were coming into prisons 'at a rate that's so dramatic they are actually cheaper than on the outside'. He told how a drug dealer used a ladder to break into Everthorpe Prison in East Yorkshire to deal drugs to inmates through their cell windows. Last night probation leaders called for an inquiry into the latest claims. 'The allegations of drug importation must be investigated further by the prison authorities as a matter of urgency,' said Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union, Napo. The allegations are the latest embarrassment for the government over its decision to free tens of thousands of prisoners early to free space in the UK's overcrowded jails. Since the introduction of the end of custody licence scheme in June last year, more than 31,000 prisoners have been released 18 days before their sentences were due to end. But the scheme has been plagued by problems. Prisoners have been routinely breaching their release conditions and reoffending. And thousands of prisoners have opted not to take early release because they prefer conditions inside. Napo estimates about 5,500 men convicted of violence against the person have been released early under the scheme. The union says it is alarmed that many of them were convicted of domestic violence and are being returned to their victims' communities without proper risk assessments being carried out. 'It is abundantly clear that significant numbers of domestic violence perpetrators are being released on end of custody licences when there is a clear risk to women,' Fletcher said. According to an analysis of the early release scheme by the Conservatives, more than 5,000 prisoners have been freed early, even though they were refused home detention curfew on an electronic tag because they were considered to pose a high risk of reoffending. The Tories also claimed that eight people convicted of sex crimes have been released early, three of them by mistake. There are also concerns over the number of offences being committed by prisoners once granted early release. A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said it had no reports recalled prisoners were bringing drugs into prison. She said information on released prisoners was shared with expert personnel who could assess the risk they posed to victims."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
