The session transcript reveals a seven-hour exercise in prevarication as White House lawyers steered Hicks away from answering questions 155 times. Lawyers prevented Hicks, who previously served as Donald Trump\u2019s White House communications director, from answering a range of questions from the mundane \u2013 \u201cWhere in the West Wing did you sit in relation to the Oval Office?\u201d \u2013 to more substantial inquiries about the resignation of the former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump\u2019s firing of James Comey, the the former FBI director. In a rare exception, Hicks, 30, did allow that she viewed Trump\u2019s order to his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to urge Jeff Sessions to \u201cunrecuse\u201d himself from the Russia investigation as \u201codd\u201d. Asked if she would take foreign opposition research from a foreign government, \u201cif that were offered when working on a political campaign\u201d, Hicks responded: \u201cYou know, knowing how much chaos has been sowed as a result of something like the Steele dossier, no, I would not.\u201d She added that she would call the FBI if she was offered information that she felt was \u201clegitimate enough to have our law enforcement dedicate their time to it, sure\u201d. Hicks also said she\u2019s has only spoken to Trump between five and 10 times since she left the White House in February 2018. But those were rare comments in a hearing that the White House has described as a violation of constitutional law separating the legislative and executive branches of government. Administration lawyers argue that Hicks was granted \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from discussing her time working at the White House, a situation that the committee chairman Jerrold Nadler described as \u201cridiculous\u201d and one which Democrats have vowed to challenge through the courts. The questions that Hicks did answer, mostly relating to her time on the 2016 campaign, are already published in the Mueller report, lending the top Republican on the panel, Georgia congressman Doug Collins, to remark that the committee \u201ctook eight hours to find out what really most of us knew at the beginning\u201d. During Hicks\u2019 testimony, the president tweeted that calling the former Oval office gatekeeper to testify was \u201cextreme Presidential Harassment\u201d. Trump added it was \u201cso sad that the Democrats are putting wonderful Hope Hicks through hell\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
