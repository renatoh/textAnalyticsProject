Freedman, founder of the independent women\u2019s website Mamamia, made the comment during a debate about the Northern Territory\u2019s plan to set up a public sex offender register, which she supports. \u201cI think what you want to do is keep children safe from people who have already acted on it and I think this [the public sex offender register] should be Australian-wide, I don\u2019t think it should just be the Northern Territory \u2026 we accept that gay people can\u2019t change who they love and who they\u2019re sexually attracted to, so why do we think that people who are sexually attracted to children can be rehabilitated,\u201d she said on Ten\u2019s The Project. \u201cI just think, name and shame them \u2013 I want to know where they are.\u201d None of the three other panellists reacted to the comment, as the network cut straight to an ad break. Freedman released a statement \u201cunreservedly apologising\u201d and attempting to explain the comments on Friday morning, saying she was \u201cmortified\u201d. \u201cNot because I have ever or would ever compare homosexuality to paedophilia \u2013 that idea is repugnant to anyone with an IQ above room temperature \u2013 but because I accidentally gave ammunition to haters and bigots and caused the words homosexuality and paedophilia to appear in the same sentence in headlines and a Twitter pile-on,\u201d she wrote. Freedman said she was trying to distil a complex issue into a 15-second grab and had failed. She said she knew there was no link between homosexuality and paedophilia and was trying to make the point that inherent sexuality could not be changed. \u201cLet me be absolutely clear: if I have upset, confused or outraged anyone who thought I would ever ever ever stand with bigotry or homophobia, I unreservedly apologise,\u201d she wrote. Freedman issued a swift but briefer apology on Thursday night after the outcry on social media. Criticism of Freedman continued, with some also taking offence at the wording of her apology, though others tweeted in her defence, including Mamamia staff. Tony Abbott has rejected the idea of a national sex offenders register and there is a lack of evidence that the idea is effective. \u201cWhat other governments do is a matter for them,\u201d the prime minister said on Thursday. \u201cI am disinclined to pursue such a thing nationally. We don\u2019t have a national murderers register. We don\u2019t have a national thieves register. We don\u2019t have a national white collar criminals register.\u201d The Australian Institute for Criminology has researched the effectiveness of Megan\u2019s Law in America, which established a public sex offender registry, and found it was \u201cdeveloped largely as a response to community agitation\u201d. Key problems identified included under-reported acts of vigilantism, and potential discouragement of victims reporting intra-family abuse. Bruce and Denise Morcombe, whose son Daniel was murdered by a convicted paedophile in 2003, are staunch supporters of a national sex offenders register as part of their campaign to protect children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
