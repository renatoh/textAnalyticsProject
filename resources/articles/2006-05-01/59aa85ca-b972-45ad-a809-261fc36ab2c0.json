Thanks for all your jealousy-themed suggestions. Jealousy is a very specific emotion so I wonder if there should be a future playlist covering infidelity in general. Some great suggestions that didn't fit this time, like Marianne Faithfull's scalding Why'd Ya Do It?, would be more appropriate then. In honour of the Eurovision Song Contest, the next playlist will feature songs named after places in Europe: countries, towns, rivers, mountain ranges, the lot. The place can be the whole title (Berlin, Vienna) or just part of it (April In Paris). The geographical borders of Europe are open to debate; for these purposes, they include the former Soviet republics and Turkey. Nothing in the UK, though, because that merits its own playlist. Off you go. Vite! Schnell! Presto! Deadline for recommendations is Monday 1pm. The archive of previous columns is accessible here, and you can also see an A-Z of every single song that has appeared in the weekly playlists. ~ New to Readers recommend? Here's how it works."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
