Featured on the BBC Holiday programme, it is now in the hands of new, younger owners, John and Gail Gravett, who have made great efforts to make a good enterprise even better. There is in-house processing, and digital facilities have also been provided. Braithwaite is a good centre for walking, and some really good hill days are accessible without use of transport, with many more only a short drive away. George Kitchin \u0095 Now in its 21st year, the Lancaster University Summer Programme offers a course in landscape photography (for those who already know the basics of camera use) and a full-day course called walking, countryside and heritage during the week July 30 to August 3, with residence available from July 29 to August 4. Accommodation is available, and there is a full evening social programme too. Gerry Cotter \u0095 As a lecturer in photography and frequent traveller, I can throughly recommend the Inversnaid Photography Centre, Scotland. Overlooking Loch Lomond, the Centre is located in a former hunting lodge, within its own 50 acre nature reserve. The Lodge has been beautifully restored and has water supplied from its own natural spring. I visited the Centre with a group of friends a couple of years ago. We took the full board option and even though we must have walked miles during our weeks stay, we still couldn't shift the extra pounds we gained from the delicious home cooked meals! The centre runs workshops with experienced photographers on location. Alternatively, and especially if the weather is bad, there is a fully equipped studio and darkroom. This is certainly a photographers' and walkers' dream location in Scotland (watch out for the Highland cattle that roam about the hills in their woolly coats!) Emma Peios \u0095 Lee Frost, one of Britain's foremost landscape photographers, runs a company called Photo Adventures which organises photographic holidays in the UK and abroad. Lee's trips include one-to-one tuition in locations from Northumberland and Dartmoor to Namibia and Venice. Lee has published a number of beautiful landscape photo books and writes regularly for Outdoor Photography magazine. He can be contacted on mail@leefrost.demon.co.uk. John Sootheran \u0095 Travelux of Tenterden, Kent, offer both photography and walking holidays to Zagoria in north-west Greece, one of Europe's most outstanding areas of natural beauty. The telephone number is 01580 765000 and their website is www.travelux.co.uk. Hope this helps. Janet Brierley \u0095 Last year we spent a week in the Scottish Highlands with a company called Wildshots. They're based in the foothills of the Cairngorms in a wonderfully scenic area which is ideal for hill walking. Wildshots offer specialist photographic holidays which are very much geared towards wildlife and landscapes, but they also cater for non-participating partners who simply want to enjoy the beautiful countryside at their leisure. While you and your friend can spend your days improving your photographic skills in a small group with an experienced photographer to guide you, your husbands can go off and explore the wilderness to their hearts content. In the evenings you can all meet up back at the accommodation which is in a converted steading by the side of the River Feshie. The food is excellent and your hosts Pete and Amanda do everything possible to create a very relaxed, house party atmosphere for their guests. Ring 01540 651352 for a copy of the brochure, or check out their website www.wildshots.co.uk. Helen Woodward \u0095 I suggest a look at travelimages.com. This excellent website describes wilderness and wildlife holidays for small groups of photographers and friends in US national parks, plus Canada, Mexico and the most beautiful locations in the Alps, the UK or Ireland. For magical photograhic locations and landscapes, this may be the answer. Run by an amiable Brummie in Idahoe, it is a real find. Trevor Phillips \u0095 Try HF holidays. This company runs a wide range of special interest holidays alongside their classic walking holidays in Britain, which enables partners or friends with varying interests to share the same comfortable house party atmosphere of their hotels, while indulging in their respective passions.They offer several guided walks each day, along with expert guidance and instruction in your chosen interest. The unique feature of HF is the friendly welcome you will receive from fellow guests, leaders and hotel staff alike. The HF 2001 brochure includes studio photography at Whitby (close to the North York Moors), Conwy in north Wales, on the island of Arran and at Pitlochry and Glencoe in mainland Scotland. They can be contacted through hfholidays.co.uk or 020.8905.9388. Ian Backhouse \u0095 The Snowdonia National Park Study Centre would provide just what you want. You stay in a comfortable country house overlooking the river Dwyryd in the National Park - the walking round about is wonderful. They organise a variety of courses including photography. 01766 590324. Jane Rooth \u0095 I would suggest a stay at the Skye Picture House (01471 822531), near Broadford on the Isle of Skye. They offer photographic courses and accommodation, and it's a wonderful location for hillwalking - access to the Cuillins at Sligachan is only 15 minutes' drive away. Kirsty Bloom \u0095 Rothay Manor Hotel in Ambleside offers a Sunday evening to Friday morning photography holiday (this year, March 25-30) for beginners and experienced photographers. Superb food and organisation for the wives, with wonderful walking (foot and mouth permitting this year) around the Lake District for the husbands (they also do walking, antiques, gardening and music holidays). From \u00a3420 for the course including early morning tea, full English breakfast, morning coffee and five course dinner (including VAT) for the five nights. Non-participating partners are welcome for \u00a340 less. Since this is an Egon Ronay recommended hotel with many other awards, it's fantastic value!
