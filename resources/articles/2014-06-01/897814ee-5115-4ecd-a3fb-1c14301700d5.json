The two games in Salvador so far have been great World Cup shows and I hope it will be the same when we play. I\u2019d like to think it will be another high-scoring game for the public, but you can never promise that.\u201d Much to Swiss amusement, France find themselves official underdogs to their neighbours, with Switzerland enjoying a much higher world ranking \u2013 sixth to France\u2019s 17th \u2013 and enjoying the status of seeds in the group. In reality France are probably favourites now they have hit a run of form after qualifying via the play-offs, though Deschamps is taking no chances. \u201cWe are on an equal footing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the seeded team, it will be a tough match. They have many good players with some of the best clubs in Europe. Both teams have three points from the first round of games, both teams have quality, it will be a high level match. It might be our toughest, our most challenging game, for a while.\u201d Deschamps would not give away any clues to his team, nor would he elaborate on Olivier Giroud\u2019s position after the Arsenal forward said he was disappointed not to have started against Honduras. \u201cOlivier is part of a group that won the first match and is getting ready for the second,\u201d he said. The Switzerland coach, Ottmar Hitzfeld, paid tribute to Deschamps for helping the France team to discover itself again, noting the \u201cexplosion\u201d of performance and confidence in their last few matches. \u201cFrance have made progress under an excellent coach,\u201d Hitzfeld said. \u201cThey are all team players again now, and that\u2019s what makes them dangerous. This game is a derby if you like, we know each other very well and we respect each other, but I am fully aware that France are the favourites. To prevail we will have to go beyond our normal limits.\u201d The Swiss may not have gained three points from their opening game against Ecuador but for a 93rd-minute winner scored by a substitute, a dramatic climax that led Hitzfeld to invoke comparisons with Manchester United. He is probably aware that a few things have changed at Old Trafford since his great pal Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down, but nevertheless insisted his side deserved their breakthrough for keeping going in a manner that would have won the Scot\u2019s approval. \u201cWe went for the win, and that showed our bravery,\u201d he said. \u201cTo score so late was a reward for taking a risk. We were exposed at the back, we could have seen a goal scored against us, but we went for the win.\u201d Asked for his opinion of Spain\u2019s early exit, Hitzfeld said the World Cup would be poorer without the defending champions. \u201cI would have like to see then reach the last four at least,\u201d the German said. \u201cI have the greatest admiration for Vicente del Bosque, and on their way to world domination Spain have played some marvellous football. It would be better if they were still around. Seeing them go home is not good for the World Cup.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
