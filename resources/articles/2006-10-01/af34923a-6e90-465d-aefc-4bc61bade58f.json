Soho Square's highly regarded finance director Alex Horne led negotiations with Multiplex, brokered by Lord Carter, and the consortium of banks underwriting debt of \u00a3433m was assuaged by the fact the FA put up \u00a336m of its reserves to break the deadlock. With the Wembley National Stadium Limited team sidelined in negotiations and focused on construction issues, questions are being asked at the highest level about their ability to run the stadium once it is completed. The possibility of the FA signing a management deal with Quintain, the company that owns land around the stadium, has not been ruled out. Security issues are also a concern. The threat level to public buildings in the capital has grown since the original designs were signed off and it is understood that the plans will require revisions if the stadium is to get the all-clear from Brent Council and the police. Maw is less A bad 10 days for British Triathlon has got worse with the announcement of the departure of the performance director, Graeme Maw. Maw's acrimonious departure was sealed at a meeting on Friday and was kept secret until yesterday when, after being contacted by this column for comment, the chief executive, Norman Brook, rushed out a press release to confirm the story. Maw's resignation follows the imposition of a three-month ban on the world champion, Tim Don, for missing three drugs tests. No takers for UKA job Finding a credible figure to lift British athletics out of the doldrums is beginning to look like the impossible job, with a number of senior figures distancing themselves from the vacant posts at the top of UK Athletics. Headhunters have been retained by UKA to find a chairman and chief executive following the departure of chief executive David Moorcroft, and last week they met with Alan Pascoe and Jon Ridgeon, chairman and chief executive respectively of the promoters Fast Track. Ridgeon has been widely tipped as a chief executive but would almost certainly have to sever his ties with Fast Track, who have contracts with UK Athletics, to take on the job. Hill-Wood: I see no bungs Despite the climate of suspicion that prompted the Stevens inquiry, Arsenal remain wedded to football's culture of secrecy. Peter Hill-Wood told shareholders yesterday that they would continue to conceal details of their transfer fees and payments to agents. The Arsenal manager, George Graham, remains the most high-profile figure ever to be caught on the take, but Hill-Wood insisted at the club's AGM that Arsenal does not have \"any problem with bungs\". \"We have never as a policy disclosed that information [agents' fees] and I don't think we would want to now,\" he said. \"I don't think we have any problem at all with bungs, so I don't think that is relevant . . . I think it is better to keep it quiet.\" New job for old Devil Nick Humby, who resigned as finance director of Manchester United earlier this week is to join Top-Up TV as chief financial officer. The company, which provides additional services to Freeview customers, recently signed a deal with Setanta that will see the broadcaster's Premier League programmes available to Freeview box owners. Money is name of game The Scottish Premierleague yesterday secured an \u00a38m four-year title-sponsorship from the Clydesdale Bank, a good deal for the majority of the clubs. Compare it with the Premier League's recently renewed \u00a365m deal with Barclays, however, and the Old Firm's desperation to head south is clear. Rent-an-Olympian The British Olympic Association is to act as an agent for Olympians, helping them find work as after-dinner speakers, attracting sponsors and punting their talents to the business community. A website, www.britisholympians.com, will showcase past and present Olympians, with the BOA taking a 10% cut of the proceeds. paul.kelso@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
