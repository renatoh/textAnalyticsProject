As Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard are a dream-team pairing, actors who radiate pure heady charisma, perhaps more than can be entirely absorbed into the fabric of the film. As ever, Cotillard \u2013 wounded, watchful \u2013 is able to give to the camera extraordinarily nuanced meanings without saying a word. Fassbender is perhaps less assured with Macbeth\u2019s introverted vulnerability but always effortlessly virile and watchable, portraying Macbeth\u2019s outbursts of anger and crazed resentment as he reinforces his usurper\u2019s position with an escalating series of violent acts. Right off the bat, Kurzel begins with a bold flourish. Tackling the perennial question of the couple\u2019s evident childlessness and Lady Macbeth\u2019s mysterious later allusions to breastfeeding, he starts with the two attending their infant\u2019s funeral. Kurzel\u2019s version intuits the way that Lady Macbeth\u2019s grief is twisted into murderous ambition, even subliminally suggesting that the weird sisters are a supernatural manifestation of her anguish. Kurzel\u2019s other flourish is the insolent way Macbeth behaves with his speech after Duncan is murdered: \u201cHad I but died an hour before this chance / I had lived a blessed time \u2026\u201d It is as if he is brazening the thing out or maybe already withdrawing into his own psychotic and delusional world. Unsubtle this Macbeth may be, just occasionally. But it\u2019s physical and exciting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
