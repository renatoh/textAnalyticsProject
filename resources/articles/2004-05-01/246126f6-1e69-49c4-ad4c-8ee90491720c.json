He is unfailingly polite, hard working and ambitious in a nice \"please-and-thank-you\" sort of way. Yet he has been miscast in the villainous role as he seeks to prove his worth as the England wicketkeeper against New Zealand at Lord's today. The selectors have been at odds over it and the purists are railing against it. There will be no more controversial decision all summer than the selection of Jones ahead of Chris Read, a dapper wicketkeeper who failed to pass muster as a Test batsman. Argue while you can, because Jones has the ability to end the debate in his favour long before the summer's end. His confident 101 for Kent against New Zealand in Canterbury last weekend, to follow his promising Test debut in Barbados, has already begun to state his case, so the problem lies not in the decision, but more the way it was handled. Rod Marsh, a selector and Read advocate, was incandescent at the lack of consultation over a major policy shift. Duncan Fletcher, the England coach who deemed that Jones's time had come, denies a rift with that familiar stony-faced expression that communicates his determination to get his own way and eschew further explanation. And, in the middle, trying to advance his career, stands Jones, 27, born in Papua New Guinea of proud Welsh ancestry, who will not be cowed by the debate over his selection. \"I'll try to get on with what I do,\" he said. \"I watched Chris in the Tests over the winter and I couldn't fail to be impressed. I aim to match his high standards as a wicketkeeper. My intention when I understudied Chris in the West Indies was to help him out. As soon as he was left out he asked what help I needed. \" Compare such an enlightened team ethic with the unfortunate manner of Read's dropping. Fletcher and Michael Vaughan, as selectors on tour, were perfectly entitled to plump for Jones in the final Test in Barbados. But they erred first in not informing Marsh, who was back in England, and then again in carelessly pronouncing that Jones could expect a decent run in the side this summer. To Marsh, who read the news on Ceefax, it felt too much like a stitch-up. The former Australia wicketkeeper felt as if his special knowledge had been ignored. But Fletcher will be proved right. Read is a dapper wicketkeeper of the highest quality but a firework batsman who, at Test level, flares briefly but ultimately leaves you staring into a dark sky. The constraints of Test cricket constantly poke at his technical inadequacies. After 14 one-day innings he averages 20; in 16 Test innings he averages 15. Jones, who averaged 44 in the championship last summer, is capable of doubling Read's Test batting average. If England dare to let him bat ahead of Andrew Flintoff, at No6, the knock-on effect could increase Flintoff's average as well. And, though Read's houseproud, feather-duster perfection behind the stumps is rightly admired, Jones's keeping is not exactly of the unkempt student bedsit variety. \"If you can expect a fair run in the side, you can plan for it and it brings a slight easing of the mind,\" he said. \"The one thing England have shown is that they are not picking players on a one-off. I watched Chris get a series of eight games and I'm sure I'll get a fair opportunity.\" Jones could so easily have been lost to England. When he arrived from Queensland in 1998 to play club cricket, it was with the prime intention of studying, \"but because I was classed as an overseas student it didn't work out\". So he went to Leicestershire and had a keep in the nets, but they never wrote back. Kent, specifically their second-XI coach Chris Stone, were shrewder judges. Since then Jones has made up for lost time. Last summer he made his maiden championship hundred against Leicestershire. His wicketkeeping improved under the tutelage of Paul Farbrace and the accolades followed, as did the understudy role in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the West Indies last winter. It was said England would struggle to find a wicketkeeper-batsman to replace Alec Stewart. Well, they have found two. It should be held as a cause for celebration, not conflict."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
