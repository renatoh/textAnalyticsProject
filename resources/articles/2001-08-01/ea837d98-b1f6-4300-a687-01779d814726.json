He gets arch references in books by Julian Barnes and Bret Easton Ellis, and has been seen behind everything from punk and the Angry Brigade to psychogeography and the postmodern theories of Jean Baudrillard. Debord was the leading light of the situationists, the small but immensely influential radical group who had their finest hour with the near-revolution in Paris in 1968. That may have failed, but the situationists' style and tactics have remained a blueprint for dissent, notably in recent anti-globalisation protests. Andrew Hussey's audacious biography is the fifth so far, and Debord is now in danger of becoming just an icon: a thinking person's Che Guevara. In the terms of Debord's own situationist theory, he is being \"recuperated by the Spectacle\". Like a lot of radical thought, Debord's theory begins as a critique of alienation, but his distinctive angle is to blame the so-called \"Spectacle\". Images have replaced the real, and life has become like a gigantic movie - or a gigantic advert - over which we have no control. In the face of this, situationist practice is a magnificent \"No!\" to the world of television, consumerism, alienated work, \"holidays\", organised sport, higher education, tourism, hire purchase: the lot. Artists were a particular b\u00e9te noire of Debord's, and the situationists were \"avant-garde\" in the strict sense. They weren't just vaguely outrageous, or a bit ahead of their time; they wanted to break down the distinction between life and art. Debord thought that if art could be abolished, then life could be lived with the same imaginative intensity and wilful shaping that are wasted on brushes and canvas. Ultimately, instead of making things, we could make \"situations\", or autonomous moments of life lived deliberately. These could be anything from a riot to a dinner party to a suicide, or even the taking of an intentionally aimless urban walk that might last for days: the notorious situationist \"drift\". Foremost among Debord's negative artistic strategies was \" d\u00e9tournement \", the subverted use of what already exists as a basis for parody, collage, creative vandalism and sly quotation. No less abrasive and canny was Debord's understanding of \"r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration\", or the way in which even the most radical gesture will eventually be commodified and turned into an item of leisure interest by the Spectacle, whether in the form of Charles Manson T-shirts, situationist retrospectives in art galleries, or handsome Jonathan Cape biographies with excitable blurbs. Intransigence was at the heart of Debord's project, and his early collage-book, M\u00e9moires, was bound in sandpaper in order to ruin the other books on your shelves. Despite that it is, of course, now intensely collectable. The situationists' bloody-mindedness made them more dangerous to their friends than to their enemies. When they appeared before a sympathetic audience at the London ICA in the 1960s, a Belgian situationist with poor English made an incomprehensible speech, ending on a characteristically menacing note: you think you have come to judge us, he warned his listeners, but we have come to judge you. \"But what is situationism?\", a hapless member of the audience wanted to know. That was it for Debord. \"We didn't come here to answer cuntish questions,\" he said, and stormed off to the pub. It might have been the word \"situationism\" that upset him, although Hussey defiantly uses it throughout his book. As with a secret handshake, insiders all know that the word is a total faux pas, because situationism (sorry, I'm doing it as well) is not an \"ism\". Edgy distinctions like this offered an opportunity for the endless one-upmanship that characterised situationist life, making it into an arena where friends were constantly being excommunicated or ostracised. As Debord's first wife, Michelle Bernstein, put it, there must be \"no useless leniency\", and particularly not to friends. Enemies, unfortunately, tend to be more out of reach. The situationists were determined not to make themselves too accessible to their admirers. \"We laugh, but not at the same time as you\", runs a cool reminder in an early publication. Their spikiness is inseparable from a particularly French style of intellectual invective: appellations such as \"mystical cretin\", \"hare-lipped Stalinist\" and \"bidet scraping\" seem to have flowed from Debord as easily as breathing. Debord's combative superiority and contempt for ordinary life fit ambiguously within the old framework of left and right. Several people in this book refer approvingly to his \"aristocratic\" demeanour and disdain for work. He situated himself on the left, but his ideas have subsequently been adopted by the ultra-right in France, and Hussey mentions unsubstantiated rumours of far-right allegiances in Debord's adolescence. As a young man Debord scratched Ne Travaillez Jamais (\"never work\") on the wall of the rue de Seine - now regarded as an early opus in the Debord canon - and in the usual sense of the word, he never did. Before becoming a successful copywriter, the formidably intelligent Michelle Bernstein supported them both by writing horoscopes for racehorses. Dining chez Debord some years later, a guest noticed that Debord's equally formidable second wife seemed to do all the washing-up. \"She does the dishes,\" Debord explained simply. \"I do the revolution.\" Hussey's particular angle is to emphasise the ludic and purely gaming aspect of Debord's revolutionary machinations. This would make distant ripples in England as \"play power\" and \"revolution for fun\", but in Debord's case it remains austerely closer to his childhood toy soldiers and his adult wargaming, which led him to invent his own boardgame, The Game of War. Hussey makes little attempt to get inside his subject's psyche, which sidesteps vulgar psychologising but leaves the book largely as an account of Debord's career, set against the backdrop of postwar French history. Readers with prior knowledge of Debord will find things missing or unexplored (there's almost nothing on the importance of Thomas De Quincey and \"the North-West Passage\", for example, no mention of the \"100 Marvels\" Chinese restaurant, and little attempt to situate Debord against avant-garde precursors). But the book is still a major achievement, with plenty of interviews and new testimony. Hussey has interesting material on Debord's early days, and makes it clear that his fixation on conflict had more than a little to do with his childhood during the second world war, which he could watch but do nothing about. There is surely a line waiting to be drawn from the young Debord's alienated viewing of Vichy newsreels to Baudrillard's dictum that the Gulf War was only a movie. Finally suffering from the effects of lifelong alcoholism, Debord shot himself in 1994. Since his death he has been recognised as a great French thinker, eclipsing various post-structuralist hair-splitters who were more famous in his lifetime. Debord's critique has never been more relevant than today, with our inane TV shows and endless pseudo-opportunities. The age of revolution may be over, but the age of refusal is just beginning. Debord is also a great writer, and his strange prose style - with its neo-classical lucidity and its paranoid grandeur - is now savoured in its own right. He would be disgusted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
