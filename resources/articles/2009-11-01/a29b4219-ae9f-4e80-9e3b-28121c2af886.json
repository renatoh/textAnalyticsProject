The 21-year-old future of pop, if you believe the hype. Born in Hereford and brought up in rural Wales, she now makes her music in the bright lights of London. The future of pop, though? How so? Goulding's sweet, ghostly disco has been getting people in a tizzy for nearly a year now, with the likes of Popjustice and Perez Hilton championing her talent. She also has a way with lyrical imagery. Take this line about falling in love from Starry Eyed: \"So we burst into colours, colours and carousels/Fall headfirst like paper planes in playground games.\" Bless. But what does she sound like? A British take on Sweden's Lykke Li. Her ethereal vocals lend themselves well to covers \u2013 her version of Bon Iver's The Wolves is a particular gem \u2013 but they also sound fantastic on trance and dubstep remixes. And what does the future hold for her? Newly signed to Polydor, Goulding will be working with Mark Ronson in the new year, having spent 2009 working with Starsmith and Frankmusik, touring with Little Boots, and having her TV debut on Later. Where can I hear her? Goulding's debut single, Under the Sheets, is released on 16 November on Neon Gold.
