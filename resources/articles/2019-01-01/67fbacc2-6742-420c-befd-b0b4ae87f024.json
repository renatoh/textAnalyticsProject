Wilbur Ross \u2013 a self-proclaimed billionaire and one of the richest members of Trump\u2019s cabinet \u2013 was asked about federal workers turning to places like homeless shelters for food donations as the partial government shutdown drags on into its second month. \u201cI know they are, and I don\u2019t really quite understand why,\u201d he said in an interview on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box. \u201cThe obligations that they would undertake, say borrowing from a bank or a credit union, are in effect federally guaranteed. So the 30 days of pay that some people will be out, there\u2019s no real reason why they shouldn\u2019t be able to get a loan against it.\u201d Some 800,000 federal workers have not been paid since a partial government shutdown began on 22 December, after Donald Trump refused to authorize government funding unless Congress agrees to his demands for funds to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. \u201cThe banks and credit unions should be making credit available to them. When you think about it, these are basically government-guaranteed loans, because the government has committed these folks will get back pay once this whole thing gets settled down,\u201d Ross said. \u201cNow, true, the people might have to pay a little bit of interest. But the idea that it\u2019s paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea. There\u2019s no reason why some institution wouldn\u2019t be willing to lend.\u201d His comments quickly drew fire from critics who called him out of touch. \u201cIs this the \u2018let them eat cake\u2019 kind of attitude?\u201d the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said at a weekly press conference. \u201cOr call your daddy for money?\u201d \u201cThis is billionaire Wilbur Ross saying he doesn\u2019t understand why federal workers not getting paid during the #TrumpShutdown don\u2019t just take out loans *to feed their families*. Unreal,\u201d the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a tweet. The Consumer Federation of America executive director, Jack Gillis, said the commerce secretary\u2019s comments were out of sync with the reality of consumer lending. \u201cOne of the challenges the workers are going to face in getting loans is they have zero income right now. Your income is the most important driver of your ability to get a loan,\u201d he said. A number of local banks and credit unions around the country have in fact offered interest-free loans to affected federal workers, but Gillis said that is not something all workers can count on. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s few and far between in terms of availability, he said. Getting a loan is not as simple as walking into a bank and asking for one, even for people with once-steady incomes. \u201cFor virtually every loan, you need some collateral. The concept of walking into a financial institution and saying, \u2018I need a loan for 30 days to carry me through\u2019 is a ludicrous concept,\u201d Gillis said. \u201cYou have to have collateral, which is why some people may tap into second mortgages on their homes.\u201d He warned that federal workers may be ensnared by notorious payday loan operations, which charge sky-high interest rates. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very easy for some of these folks to become victims of payday lenders, and end up paying 200%, 300% interest because they need the money fast and they may not have the credit rating necessary to get a personal loan,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the perfect environment for payday lenders to wreak havoc.\u201d Ross later sought to clarify his comments, telling Bloomberg TV that he was just trying to make sure that \u201cworkers who are experiencing liquidity crises\u201d know that government employee credit unions are offering low-interest loans. \u201cWe\u2019re aware, painfully aware, that there are hardships inflicted on the individual workers,\u201d he said. In the CNBC interview, Ross also played down the importance of the 800,000 unpaid workers in a broader economic context. \u201cI think that\u2019s a great deal of hyperbole,\u201d he said of predictions that the shutdown would hurt the country\u2019s image. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 800,000 workers, and while I feel sorry for the individuals that have hardship cases, 800,000 workers. If they never got their pay \u2013 which is not the case, they will eventually get it, but if they never got it, you\u2019re talking about a third of a percent on our GDP. So it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a gigantic number overall.\u201d Trump, too, sought to downplay the comments. Ross was probably trying to suggest that supermarkets and banks would be willing to float customers unable to pay, Trump said in rambling remarks at the White House. \u201cThey know the people, they\u2019ve been dealing with them for years, and they work along,\u201d Trump said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
