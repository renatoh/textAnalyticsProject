With Waiting For Guffman he tackled the amateur hell that is community theatre, then went on to send up the whole dog show circuit on his Best in Show. With A Mighty Wind, Guest moves on to folk music. His amiable mockumentary charts the events leading up to a concert that reunites three acts from the 60s folk explosion. Stage right you have the New Main Street Singers, a gaggle of wholesome, fluorided thigh-slappers, while stage left The Folksmen radiate woolly-jumpered integrity. Meanwhile the pathos is provided by the troubled Mitch and Mickey, who once shared a tender kiss on stage and have never seen each other since. Events build to the climactic show where the event's neurotic promoter (Bob Balaban) worries that the flower arrangement in the lobby might pose a danger to the fee-paying public. A Mighty Wind is certainly full of spry comic touches. Eugene Levy's performance as the anguished Mitch, for instance, manages to be both hilarious and oddly moving. Elsewhere, Fred Wiilard (so good as the TV host in Best in Show) returns as a crass producer with a habit of corpsing at his own jokes. His big idea is a TV spectacular which rekits the New Main Street Singers as Supreme Court judges who deliver their verdicts as a hearty singalong. All of which is vibrantly amusing. Even so, one still steps out of A Mighty Wind feeling faintly let down. Maybe it's because Guest's line of attack is finally too gentle for its own good. You can't help feeling that the director rather likes his characters (which is fine) and thoroughly approves of the world they live in (which is more problematic). He pokes fun at the folk scene the way a parent might rib a favoured offspring: tenderly and within strict boundaries. As a result, his film emerges as one part satire to two parts celebration. \u00b7 A Mighty Wind is showing at the Odeon West End on Saturday November 1 at 8.30pm and Monday November 3 at 3.30pm. Masterclass with Christopher Guest is on Sunday November 2 at 4pm at the NFT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
