As a Security Branch operative, he had plotted the assassination of Desmond Tutu, firebombed a cathedral and done his best to wreck the Mandelas' marriage. By his own reckoning, he and his comrades were responsible for most of the bombs that went off in South Africa. Roger Lucey was the same age, and from a similar background. But he grew up to be a musician rather than a secret policeman, and in time became one of Erasmus's victims. After Lucey sang about one of the many black men who had died in police custody, Erasmus was ordered to destroy his career. It was nothing personal - Erasmus even played Lucey's music while on stakeout - but his actions drove the singer to drinks, drugs and divorce. And yet the two are now close. \"It's an unusual friendship,\" Lucey says with epic understatement. They talk about their journey in Tuning into the Enemy (1.30pm, Radio 4)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
