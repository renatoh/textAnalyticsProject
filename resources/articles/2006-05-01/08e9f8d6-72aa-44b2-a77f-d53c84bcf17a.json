Now he enjoys a successful portfolio career as an artist, toy designer and author. He is busy promoting his first book, Vortigern's Machine, which tells the story of two 12-year-old boys who roam the streets of a fictional town where they are sucked into an adventure that features a talking dog and an angry gorilla. Before turning his talents to writing, Jarvis was an illustrator who went on to combine this career with designing toys. Of writing, he says: \"I wanted to tell stories rather than just make decorative figurines. I specifically wanted to draw a comic book in the tradition of Tintin and Asterix. Vortigern's Machine, which I produced with Russell Waterman, is my attempt at this.\" After completing his first degree, Jarvis spent two years at the Royal College of Art, where he did an MA in illustration. While at the RCA he got to know the staff of Covent Garden-based store Slam City Skates and drew some adverts for them. When they launched a clothing label called Holmes, Jarvis produced graphics for T-shirts and drawings for the catalogues. More work poured his way when Holmes launched clothing brand Silas. Then Jarvis decided to establish Amos Toys, with two senior colleagues from Holmes. \"We felt that it was wrong for my characters to be so closely linked with fashion. That's why we set up Amos,\" he says. Jarvis enjoys his work and plans to continue juggling writing with illustration and toy making. But, for the moment, his main priority is to promote Vortigern's Machine and to do all he can to get an animated version of the book on to the small or big screen. He adds: \"We are talking to large entertainment corporations in America, who have seen the book. Some see it as a 30-minute animation series - like The Simpsons, while others see it as an animation film.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
