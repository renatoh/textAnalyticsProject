The Frenchman will make the need to take six points from next week's league games at the Emirates his priority. Arsenal will leapfrog Manchester United and move within a point of Chelsea if they beat Bolton on Wednesday and they could top the division if they beat Everton four days later. Arsenal have won five of six league games since the 3-0 home loss to Chelsea in November that left them 11 points adrift, form that suggests the Gunners could win the title for the first time since 2004. \"I will have to rest some players,\" said the Arsenal manager, whose last trophy came in this competition in 2005, when Manchester United were beaten in the final. \"We want to win but we want to protect [players] for our home games against Bolton and Everton as well. That Bolton game becomes very important for us. We want to keep our momentum going, so I will change some players. That is sure. \"The Premier League is always more important but, in the eyes of the fans, we are looking for trophies. However, the Premier League is so hard that you want to take care of your position. Two years ago we had a very good chance [to win the title] and we were not far away. At the moment we have to maintain our spirit and our attitude, and then we will have a chance.\" Cesc F\u00e1bregas, Den\u00edlson and Theo Walcott will be missing at Upton Park thanks to hamstring, back and rib injuries. Wenger will not field an entirely youthful side, but he will be tempted to rest Manuel Almunia, Samir Nasri, Andrey Arshavin, Thomas Vermaelen and William Gallas. Alex Song will play his final match before going to the African Cup of Nations. The midfielder may return to find Wenger has strengthened his squad, though a move for the forward Marouane Chamakh will not happen this month. \"Chamakh is in the Champions League with Bordeaux and at the top of their league so he will not move now,\" Wenger said. \"He has four months to go on his contract and they have no interest in selling him. But I will move [in the transfer window] as early as I can. For now, I am like I was when I was a student and I had to study for an exam. I will wait a while.\" West Ham's thoughts are on their struggle against relegation. Gianfranco Zola, who may pick Freddie Sears in the absence of the suspended Guillermo Franco, said: \"We will have a go. Maybe the FA Cup is not a priority, but we will be up for it. We'll have the possibility to play some different players, but I will take it seriously. We want to honour the competition.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
