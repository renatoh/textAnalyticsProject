Her first reaction to the gift was to think \u201cA bum bag? Oh my god,\u201d but then \u201cit was about reframing my mind \u2026 practicality wins the day\u201d. Getting over preconceptions for the sake of something beneficial is something Kahn is very good at. After years of running a successful events company, she realised that the standard industry practice of throwing food away at the end of the night was not only wasteful \u2013 but something that could be changed. The insight led her to found food rescue charity OzHarvest \u2013 now the largest organisation of its kind in Australia. Rethinking and reorientation is also the theme of her intimate memoir, A Repurposed Life, co-written with her daughter-in-law Jessica Chapnik Kahn. Between writing the book and steering her organisation through the unprecedented upheavals and demands of Covid-19, Kahn\u2019s had to squeeze a lot in lately. Hence, the bum bag, which has seen her through, along with two other equally practical items. A handmade knife I used to have a Japanese ceramic knife, which I loved, but over the years it got very chipped. So I asked Trav, our exec chef, to find me a new knife. I thought if anybody knows how to choose one, he does. Then this box arrived and it contained the most beautiful knife \u2013 I don\u2019t actually even know if it was made by a company; it\u2019s handmade and it\u2019s got the signature of the person who made it. I\u2019ve never experienced such joy as using this knife. The handle is wood, and it just feels like it was carved with love. It is literally the happiest thing to be chopping \u2013 but it\u2019s so sharp, I have to be careful! The fact that it was a gift from Trav, and such a beautiful implement for me to create food to nourish my friends and family, is very precious. A watering can I live in an apartment with the lovely deck and a big garden. The garden has some edible things, but I have to walk down a steep flight of stairs to get to the garden. So, right at the beginning of Covid-19, when I realised we\u2019d be stuck at home I decided I needed something beautiful growing on my deck. I called a landscape gardener to help me put in an edible garden, which he did. But that\u2019s not the thing! The thing is the watering can, because I have to use the watering can \u2013 again in order to nourish my plants \u2013 and when I don\u2019t, boy I see the results fast. I\u2019ve now realised how important the watering can is. It\u2019s green and very pretty. I mist early mornings, and wait till evening, when the plants are so thirsty, to water. As much as I\u2019d like to be a gardener, I am so not a gardener. Right now most of the garden has gone to seed, but I had radishes, rocket, thyme and marjoram, nasturtiums. I\u2019m about to do tomatoes, but at the moment the only thing I\u2019ve got growing are these glorious, huge marigolds. A bum bag This is the thing that I use absolutely every day. My sister lives in Los Angeles and one day, two or three years ago, a parcel arrived. It was a yellow bum bag, and she said: \u201cHow can I walk past the store and not buy this and send it to you?\u201d It is without doubt the most useful thing I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 one, because I walk a lot, two, because if I do go out with my grandchildren, it\u2019s just the most useful thing not having to hold anything in your hands, to be hands-free. It has become my most beloved item. I\u2019ve been looking for another one, that\u2019s bigger so I can fit a notebook in it, and haven\u2019t found one that just feels right. So my yellow bum bag is it \u2013 it just gets thrown into the washing machine. It\u2019s not the most beautiful, it probably wasn\u2019t the most expensive thing. It\u2019s about just making it work. I wear it going out to dinners, it\u2019s so much easier than thinking about where I\u2019m going to put my handbag. It\u2019s precious because it came from my sister, and it is without doubt the most practical thing I\u2019ve ever had."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
