But Southampton denied such a scenario will unfold and said Beattie will be joining the rest of their squad that leaves today for a pre-season fitness week in Austria. Also included is Kevin Phillips, another rumoured to be leaving, but who as things stand is staying at Southampton next season. The most likely attacking players to depart are Marian Pahars and Brett Ormerod. The Southampton manager Paul Sturrock said yesterday that Crouch had been bought to play with Beattie rather than instead of him. \"He can take some of the pressure off Beats and allow him to play his running game,\" said Sturrock. \"I just felt we needed something a bit different, someone to hold the ball and give us options. But it does not mean we are getting rid of James.\" The goalkeeper Antti Niemi has signed an extension to his contract, tying him to Southampton until June 2008. The chairman Rupert Lowe said: \"He has been outstanding for us in the past two seasons. We always said we would reward performance and we have kept that promise.\" Bolton Wanderers have taken Le Havre's Cameroonian goalkeeper Carlos Idriss Kameni on trial until Tuesday. The 20-year-old has attracted interest from West Bromwich Albion and Espanyol and would cost a nominal fee. Meanwhile the full-back Nicky Hunt, 20, has signed a new four-year deal. He said: \"I was more than happy to commit myself to my hometown club for the next four years.\" The club's veteran goalkeeper Kevin Poole has also signed a new one-year deal. The Republic of Ireland defender Ian Harte said he was looking forward to a new challenge after signing a four-year contract with the recently promoted Spanish side Levante on a free transfer from debt-laden Leeds. \"Levante are a really ambitious club and I'm keen to help the team and to stay here for a long time,\" said the left-back, 26, who has won 56 Ireland caps and spent nine years at Elland Road. \"It's good for my career to come to the best league in the world and to form part of a Levante side that has just been promoted to the Primera Liga,\" he said. Partick Thistle have given up their fight to stay in the Premier League. A Scottish Football Association appeals sub-committee told them they have no grounds of appeal after Inverness Caledonian Thistle, who took the first division title, won a second ballot of SPL clubs to allow them to share at Aberdeen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
