As they chanted \"Lucio, get out\" on Monday night they were followed by about 300 vehicles sounding their horns. Led by the mayor, Jaime Nebot, they accused the president of violating the constitution and interfering with the independence of the judiciary. They also demanded more money for the city police force. The dispute began in December when Mr Guti\u00e9rrez's congressional allies sacked 31 judges and named replacements sympathetic to the government. This was condemned as an unconstitutional attempt by the president to control all three branches of government. On Friday, in an attempt to placate the protesters, Mr Guti\u00e9rrez dissolved the court. Late on Sunday, congress ratified his decision. Mr Guti\u00e9rrez, a cashiered army colonel elected in 2002, also declared a state of emergency on Friday, banning public protests in the capital, Quito, but he lifted it less than 24 hours later as residents, chanting and sounding car horns, turned out in defiance of the ban. As the protests grew in Guayaquil, those in Quito diminished to a few hundred people scattered around the city. There were small marches in the capital in support of the government. On Sunday night Mr Guti\u00e9rrez told foreign reporters at the government palace that he would not give up his post, and he played down the street protests in the capital, which had begun on Wednesday. He said he recognised that the marches showed there was \"discontent in part of the population of Quito\". But he added that those taking part represented only a small portion of the capital's inhabitants. \"We have more than 2m inhabitants, and I think that the marches have not exceeded 10,000, 20,000 people,\" he said. \"We could say that 1% ... are actively participating. \"In the rest of the country, the situation is completely calm.\" Guayaquil, Ecuador's financial centre, which has a population of 2.2m, was the first city to join Quito in staging protests. The congress's unanimous (in the absence of 11 members) decision to rescind the December resolution was reached near midnight, after seven hours of debate. The crisis was set in motion in November when the judges then in office sided with opposition politicians in a failed effort to impeach Mr Guti\u00e9rrez on corruption charges. The president assembled a block of 52 members, which voted in December to remove the judges. The political tension reached breaking point when former president Abdala Bucaram returned to Ecuador earlier this month after a supreme court ruling cleared him of corruption charges. Mr Guti\u00e9rrez's opponents claim that he stacked the court in Mr Bucaram's favour in return for Mr Bucaram's party voting to block the impeachment motion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
