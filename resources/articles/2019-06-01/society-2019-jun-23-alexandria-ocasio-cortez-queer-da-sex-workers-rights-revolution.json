It\u2019s here, on any given night, that the city\u2019s LGBT sex workers ply their trade. It\u2019s a notoriously insecure and problematic line of work, and none more so than for immigrant transgender sex workers, thanks to elevated levels of police harassment, lack of access to the system of bail bonds, and the threat of roundups by the Immigration Customs Enforcement agency. These workers\u2019 rights are being championed by Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, a queer Latina woman running for Queens district attorney in a vote on Tuesday \u2013 and when Ocasio-Cortez enthusiastically endorsed her campaign two weeks ago, it helped propel Cab\u00e1n\u2019s marginal candidacy to centre-stage, and with it the issue of legalising sex work in the city. Over the past week, parts of the national Democratic political establishment, as represented by presidential contenders Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, followed the Bronx congresswoman\u2019s lead in backing the 31-year-old public defender. The New York Times followed suit, arguing in an editorial that Cab\u00e1n was the Democrat best poised to become \u201cone of a growing number of prosecutors to show what can be done without infringing on civil liberties, criminalising black and Hispanic Americans and mistaking punishment for the only form of justice\u201d. In making the endorsement, the paper went against New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, and the rest of the Democratic establishment, writing that their candidate \u2013 the borough\u2019s president, Melinda Katz \u2013 \u201chas no experience as a prosecutor nor long commitment to criminal justice reform\u201d. While the choice of DA in a New York borough with a population of two and half million might seem like a marginal issue, the race is a significant marker in the effort by progressives vying to pull the Democratic party to the left ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election. Moreover, it\u2019s a test of the star power of Ocasio-Cortez and her cohorts in the Democratic Socialists of America. \u201cAOC\u201d, having seen off Amazon\u2019s plans to build a new headquarters in nearby Long Island City, continues her provocations. Last week she accused the Trump administration of running \u201cconcentration camps\u201d on the southern border. \u201cThe fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalised practice in the home of the free is extraordinarily disturbing and we need to do something about it,\u201d she posted on Instagram. But under her tutelage, Democrats are learning that seemingly marginal issues, in this case the rights of immigrant trans sex workers, can be re-fashioned as a mainstream political issue, in this case in the service of criminal justice reform. The endorsement, Cab\u00e1n told the Observer last week at a noisy rally for trans sex workers rights, showed that her candidacy was a continuation of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s grassroots movement. \u201cHer endorsement was great because when you talk about not having a million dollars in the bank, you talk about doing this person-to-person, door-to-door, and that amplifies the message of a candidate like me. People are excited about what we stand for.\u201d In keeping with AOC\u2019s campaign, Cab\u00e1n\u2019s immediate opponents are not Republicans but the Democratic establishment. In Cab\u00e1n\u2019s case, she hopes to fill the district attorney position held for 28 years by Richard Brown, who died earlier this year aged 86. If Cab\u00e1n wins on Tuesday, it will show that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s revolution has maintained its potency, says Daniel Altschuler at the pro-immigration campaign group Make The Road. \u201cTiffany, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is a movement candidate. She\u2019s using her campaign as a vehicle to lift the work and demands of grassroots social organisations.\u201d The post of Queens DA is potentially a springboard to becoming Manhattan DA, then to joining New York\u2019s Southern District judicial circuit, which is currently spearheading investigations into the Trump Organisation, and a position on a federal bench and, perhaps, the supreme court. Meanwhile, local criminal justice issues are pressing, none more so than in the case of trans sex workers who, supporters of decriminalisation argue, face arrest in disproportionate numbers and suffering long periods in detention because they are unable to access the system of cash bail bonds. Bianey Garcia-D la O \u2013 a transgender campaigner for LGBT justice who was kidnapped and forced into sex work at 16 by a man who threatened to \u201ccall immigration\u201d if she objected \u2013 was held for 19 months in Rikers Island prison because she could not raise a $25,000 bail bond. \u201cWe are people of colour and also without money for bail, so we end up in Rikers,\u201d she said. But the injustice doesn\u2019t start there, she added. \u201cThe cops treat us like we are nothing. They don\u2019t pick up straight girls. They don\u2019t care. They just laugh at us.\u201d Cab\u00e1n, Garcia-D la O said, was \u201cthe only candidate supporting the most vulnerable members of our community and the only one that understands our issues\u201d. Those issues were tragically highlighted two weeks ago when Layleen Polanco, a 27-year-old African-Latina trans woman, was found dead in solitary confinement on Rikers Island. The timing of her death \u2013 just as the city gears up to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising \u2013 could hardly be a more poignant reminder that some in the LGBT community have yet to benefit from the successes of the gay rights movement. Polanco, also known as Layleen Xtravaganza, was arrested on 13 April. She was being held on $500 bail for a low-level prostitution-related offence, in addition to a low-level drugs charge. Her cause of death has not yet been determined. Polanco\u2019s death highlights three discriminatory aspects of the legal system, according to Decrim NY, a group campaigning for the decriminalisation of sex work: \u201cShe was criminalised for sex work. She was held on $500 bail for misdemeanour charges. And she was placed in solitary confinement.\u201d David Shanies, a lawyer representing Polanco\u2019s mother and estate, has accused the city of failing to protect her and \u201ctrying to sweep her death under the rug.\u201d According to LGBT campaign group the Anti-Violence Project, 68% of LGBT homicide victims are transgender or gender-nonconforming, while analysis by the National Transgender Discrimination Survey found 40% of black and 33%of Latino- and Latina-identified trans respondents had participated in the sex trade. In broad terms, Shanies told the Observer, Polanco\u2019s death exemplifies the discrimination facing transgender people. \u201cThe plight of the transgender community extends to all aspects of life, but nowhere is this more pronounced than in the criminal justice system.\u201d At the rally, where around 75 trans sex workers came out in support, Cab\u00e1n said that, as DA, she would not ask for cash bail for any charges and would not prosecute sex workers or their customers. She is also in favour of closing down Rikers Island. In sum, her proposals mark a significant departure from decades-old polices that have led to record levels of incarceration. \u201cWe\u2019ve been punching public health issues through our criminal justice system and they don\u2019t belong in the system, especially when we\u2019re talking about communities that have been historically marginalised,\u201d Cab\u00e1n told the Observer. Her candidacy, she said, represented \u201ca clean break from the status quo. So I understand that people who are resistant to change might be a little bit nervous.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
