Having bowled the home side out for 163, with Glenn McGrath taking four for 31, Australia coasted to victory in 35.1 overs for the loss of two wickets, giving them a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series. \"I thought our bowling was excellent,\" Ponting said. \"The bowlers started very well by getting early wickets to put them on the back foot and then Glenn finished them off. But I thought our fielding was a bit sloppy as we dropped a couple of chances we would normally take.\" Australia's comprehensive win was their 19th one-day victory in a row and, although that feat is already a world record, Ponting wants to extend his team's dominance. \"We don't think about these things when we go out there,\" he added, \"but we want to extend the winning streak for as long as we can.\" Ponting, who scored an unbeaten 57 to guide his team to victory, to go with his 59 in the opening game, admitted he is enjoying the wickets in the Caribbean. \"All the wickets I have played on have been very good for batting,\" he said. \"I feel pretty good and I hope this run of form continues.\" West Indies' captain Brian Lara was upset that his team had failed to deliver with the bat. \"We batted badly,\" he said. \"We lost three wickets in the first 15 overs and obviously it put us on the back foot. I said that Australia won most of their games in the World Cup in the first 15 overs and we have to look at that. \"The first 15 overs should be used to set ourselves up for the remainder of the innings but from very early we had to play a waiting game. We need to find someone who can bat throughout the innings. One of the top three batsmen must get big scores if we want to get competitive totals.\" The Scottish Saltires remain unbeaten in second place in the Second Division of the National League after the abandonment of yesterday's meeting with Middlesex Crusaders. The Scots had reduced Middlesex to 88 for four in the 21st over in Edinburgh before heavy rain soaked the bowlers' run-ups and the game was called off at 5.50pm. New Zealand scrambled to a nine-run victory over Sri Lanka in Dambulla in the tri-nations series. It was the fifth successive low-scoring match in a tournament that has seen one half-century in 10 innings. New Zealand were sent in and restricted to 156 for eight, with the wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum providing their top score of 47. But it proved more than adequate as Daniel Vettori took a career-best four for 14 and Sri Lanka were all out for 147 with five balls to spare."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
