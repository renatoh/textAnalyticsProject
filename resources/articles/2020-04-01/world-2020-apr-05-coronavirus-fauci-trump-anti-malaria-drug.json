In White House briefings on Saturday and Sunday, Trump urged Americans worried about the virus to try hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, arthritis and lupus that has not been extensively tested for other conditions. \u201cTake it. What do you have to lose?\u201d Trump said on Saturday, suggesting he might do so himself after asking \u201cmy doctors\u201d. On Sunday, Trump said America doesn\u2019t have time \u201cto take a couple years\u201d to test the efficacy of the drug in treating Covid-19. But Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top doctor on infectious diseases and a key member of the White House taskforce, was adamant there was nothing to suggest the medicine had any benefit against coronavirus. \u201cIn terms of science, I don\u2019t think we can definitively say it works,\u201d he told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cThe data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there\u2019s no effect.\u201d Dr James Phillips, professor of emergency medicine at George Washington University hospital, said Americans could be risking their health if they followed the president\u2019s advice to take a drug for a condition for which it had not been tested. \u201cWe don\u2019t know enough to make medical recommendations,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous message for someone without a medical license to get up there and tell people to try it. You need to listen to physicians, people who understand science, before you go willy-nilly into the medicine cabinet.\u201d Fauci has been reluctant to directly criticise the president, with whom he speaks regularly, but has found himself repeatedly having to contradict the president over hydroxychloroquine, which has become a hobby horse at White House briefings. On 21 March, the day after another nationally televised Trump claim that the drug \u201clooked promising\u201d, Fauci was asked directly if it could be used to treat Covid-19. \u201cThe answer is no,\u201d he said. Last month, a man in Arizona died after he and his wife took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is also found in hydroxychloroquine. \u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\u201d the man\u2019s wife told NBC. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, by Sunday lunchtime about 313,000 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US and more than 8,500 people had died. Fauci did concur with White House messaging that a grim period lies ahead in the battle against the virus, and that the US is \u201cstruggling\u201d to control the pandemic. \u201cThis is going to be a bad week, unfortunately,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be prepared that even though it\u2019s clear mitigation is working, we\u2019re still going to see \u2026 deaths.\u201d Fauci said there were glimmers of hope, but not things were due to get worse first. \u201cWe should hope that within a week, maybe a little bit more, we\u2019ll start to see a flattening out of the curve, and it coming down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the end result of that you don\u2019t see for days, if not weeks down the pipe. Things are going to get bad and we need to prepare for that, it is going to be shocking to some. \u201cI will not say we have it under control, that would be a false statement, we are struggling to get it under control.\u201d Even after the crisis was over, Fauci warned, the possibility of a resurgence remained. \u201cUnless we get this globally under control, there\u2019s a very good chance it will assume a seasonal nature. It will unlikely be completely eradicated from the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re pushing so hard on getting our preparedness much better, pushing on a vaccine and doing clinical trials for therapeutic interventions so that hopefully if we do see that resurgence we will have interventions we did not have at the beginning of the situation we\u2019re in right now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
