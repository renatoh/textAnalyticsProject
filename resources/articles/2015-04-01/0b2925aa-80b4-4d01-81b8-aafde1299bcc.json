The former secretary of state may be viewed by the political establishment as the all-but-certain Democratic nominee for the White House. But Democratic operatives and activists are pushing back at that sense of inevitability. They insist that Clinton, who will formally launch her campaign to be the Democratic nominee as the clear frontrunner on Sunday, has a great many hands to shake in the state before she can count on Iowa\u2019s support. \u201cShe needs to try and convince us she\u2019s not just the anointed one,\u201d said John Sprole, a 66-year-old attorney who was volunteering at a Democratic awards dinner in Polk County on Friday. Like nearly every other Democrat in Iowa interviewed by the Guardian over the last 48 hours, Sprole said he was undecided over who should be the party\u2019s presidential candidate. But was hungry for \u201ca debate\u201d. That sentiment was repeated by Democrats time and again at local party events in the state: activists want a contest, and feel they are missing out on the healthy debate that is well under way among Republicans. There is no clear frontrunner in the GOP race, where a crowded field of potential candidates are battling over ideas and philosophy. \u2018We don\u2019t know where she stands\u2019 The Clinton campaign is determined to avoid any appearance that the former New York senator is taking Iowa for granted. Clinton\u2019s dramatic defeat to Barack Obama in the 2008 Iowa caucus dealt a huge blow to her presidential prospects. Many blamed a neglect of the state \u2013 and alleged failure to connect with Iowans on a one-on-one basis. This time will be different. Clinton\u2019s first trip as 2016 presidential candidate will be to Iowa; one source familiar with the campaign told the Guardian Clinton could fly to the first-in-the-nation state as soon as Sunday. There are, of course, many Democrats in Iowa who are strongly supportive of the former first lady, although they appear to be keeping a low profile. \u201cShe has by far the most experience in geopolitics, foreign relations, working with foreign leaders,\u201d said Dave Binder, a retired academic and one of only two Democrats questioned at the Polk County dinner who said he backed Clinton. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that the support for her is probably a lot deeper than you would see on the surface.\u201d Indeed, a more common response was among diners was that of Vernon Naffier, 77, and his wife Joyce, 75. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where she stands,\u201d Vernon Naffier said of Clinton, who the pair met eight years ago and found \u201crather distant\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely a politician, we know that,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe know where Elizabeth Warren stands or Bernie Sanders stands.\u201d Warren, a senator for Massachusetts, is refusing to enter the race, to the frustration of liberal Democrats who have been imploring her to run. Sanders, Vermont\u2019s independent senator, has said he might seek the Democratic nomination, although no-one prepared to call themselves a \u201csocialist\u201d is likely to get far in an American presidential race. Vice-president Joe Biden has also floated the possibility he may enter the race, although there are few if any signs that he is serious. Iowans relish their status as the first-in-the-nation caucus, and are proud of what they see as their unique peek behind the facade of presidential campaigns to decipher the real candidate. But Clinton\u2019s juggernaut of a campaign, which has discouraged other serious contenders from entering the race, is set to rob Democrats in the state of their chance to shape the nation\u2019s presidential cycle. Her campaign, which will draw on a huge and supremely well-funded network in Iowa, as elsewhere, is eclipsing the trio of Democrats who have said they are exploring a possible run in 2016. They include Martin O\u2019Malley and Lincoln Chafee, former governors of Maryland and Rhode Island, and Jim Webb, a former senator from Virginia. Both O\u2019Malley and Webb have been touring Iowa in recent weeks, and both gave speeches in Polk County on Friday. Webb looked subdued, giving a speech that appeared to send one man to sleep. O\u2019Malley sparked a little more enthusiasm from the crowd of 250, with the kind of stirring, populist speech that hinted at comparisons he might want made with the current president. He repeatedly hinted that he, too, could slay the Clinton giant in Iowa. \u2018I like big odds and tough fights\u2019 On Thursday, after hosting a fundraiser for a Democratic representative outside Indianola, O\u2019Malley drove 20 miles north, to play guitar at a packed tavern in Beaverdale. The Des Moines neighborhood is known locally as \u201cObamadale\u201d, after it became a hotbed of energised support that grew for Obama in the months leading up to the 2008 caucus. Yet O\u2019Malley, on present form, is no certainly Obama. At this stage in the election cycle eight years ago, Obama was neck-and-neck with Clinton, polling around 20% in Iowa. This time around, Clinton appears to be polling around 60%, while O\u2019Malley, according to an average of polls, is at 0.3%. The governor disagreed with the notion that this suggested an Obama-style insurgency was virtually impossible. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI kind of like big odds and tough fights. History is full of examples of inevitable frontrunners being inevitable frontrunners \u2013 right up until they\u2019re not.\u201d Attendees at Thursday\u2019s Indianola fundraiser seemed to agree. Earl Agan, the business master for Iowa\u2019s cement maker\u2019s union, said O\u2019Malley was \u201cnot nearly as far behind as people think\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m one of the people, and I think there\u2019s a growing number of us, who think we\u2019ve had enough Bushes and Clintons in office,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to see another one of them.\u201d He described Clinton as \u201ca hypocrite\u201d for allowing her family\u2019s charitable foundation to accept money \u201cfrom countries that absolutely treat women horrendously\u201d, and said her experience in the state last time had not been forgotten. \u201cShe took us for granted and she got burned,\u201d he said. \u201cIowans aren\u2019t very forgiving people.\u201d Even as a lifelong Democrat, Agan would said he not vote for Clinton in the 2016 general election if she won his party\u2019s nomination. It is rare to find Democrats in Iowa who feel that strongly about Clinton. Most seem to respect her and believe she is a formidable and experienced candidate, even if they don\u2019t love her. They say they have reservations about their presumptive nominee but, most of all, they\u2019re desperate to see more of her. \u201cWe have seen her in the state of Iowa once \u2013 one time \u2013 since 2008,\u201d said Carol Kochheiser, a 68-year-old retired math teacher, back at the Polk County event. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure she has much of a relationship with Iowa.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
