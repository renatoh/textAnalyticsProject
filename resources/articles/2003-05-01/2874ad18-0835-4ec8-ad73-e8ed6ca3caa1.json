Your scruffy locks and callow face will be openly mocked in the streets; people will groan as you haul out your scraggy NUS card for that 10% discount at the pictures, for in the eyes of the taxpayer you are pondweed; after all, they are paying for you to read Baudelaire, sonny. Some people - and they're generally balding and well-paunched and use the word \"cruet\" - like to expound a load of codswallop about your university days being the best time of your life. The mere idea that you're supposed to be having 24-hour, non-stop f-u-n can make the reality of university seem a little humdrum: you still have to write essays and buy toothpaste, for example. University is just three years of your life, and if you don't have the most stunning time, there's no need to believe that it's all downhill from here. One size does not fit all. On the other hand, university can be brilliant. Most importantly, you'll have the opportunity to really wallow in the subject you love. You'll have access to vast libraries and advanced technology, not to mention tutors and lecturers who know acres about your area of study and can be enlightening and invigorating and inspiring. There's been a whole lot of emphasis placed on how, by going to university, you will get a better job. Hopefully you're going to study for a degree because you want to learn, not because you're seeing gleaming dollar signs on the horizon. However, university isn't purely about studying. Indeed, there will be days you sleep in till lunchtime, miss all of your lectures, and only heave yourself out of your grubby pit of a bed in time to crack open the ginger nuts and watch Columbo. There will be days when, depite your best intentions, you fail to read the entire works of Charles Dickens in time for your tutorial and find yourself having to kick a copy of Hard Times about your room in an effort to make it look well-thumbed. There will even be days when, sitting with a hangover the size of a rhinocerous atop your head, you attempt to wrestle with the finer points of Wittgenstein and lose. The thing is, in the real world you rarely get the opportunity to do this sort of thing. In the real world nobody asks you for your opinion of the verse of EE Cummings, and in the real world very few people are paid to eat biscuits and watch Peter Falk in a scruffy mac. Unless they work for McVities. This kind of slackeresque behaviour, of staying up late muddling over the complexities of the world with a lady in a kaftan and a bloke with a goatee, of sleeping late and surviving on coffee and ProPlus, is peculiar to university life, and should be relished. Indeed by the time you leave university, you should have done all of these things at least once. You should also have been to one of those ridiculously over-priced black-tie balls, and walked home without your shoes. You're living away from home for possibly the first time in your life. This, in itself, is mighty exciting. You can go where you like and wear what you like. Many students can pass for ordinary civilians, but for some, university is a chance to try out a dozen new styles in the course of a week. By the end of your first term you may have decided to dye your hair cerise and sport tie-dye pantaloons, and frankly if there's a time in your life when this might be acceptable, it's now, when you're a student. The student room is nigh-on legendary, and is not complete without at least three half-drunk cups of coffee in various stages of mouldification. In addition, you will require a limescaley kettle, some very cheap teabags, a cafetiere (uncleaned) and a carton of milk, which you will invariably keep in a plastic bag on your window ledge, because that schlep to the kitchen down the hall becomes a little wearisome after a while. In terms of decoration, the Che Guevara poster remains popular, despite the fact that very few students actually know anything about the man himself, except that (i) he had something to do with Cuba, and (ii) he looks pretty darned sweet against that red background. You will also have a spider plant, bought for you by your mum, who once read somewhere that it helps relieve stress. The plant will die approximately halfway through your first term, possibly because of your failure to water it, or possibly because you watered it with vodka. Your room may also boast a desklamp, an ethnic wall-hanging you picked up in Nepal on your gap year, and a vast array of free postcards and/or pictures of your mates standing slightly too close to the camera and leering. Down the hall you'll find the student kitchen. The sink will always be full of dirty pans and stagnant water. Everyone will mysteriously claim that the pans do not belong to them. Additionally, people will always steal your food - not in a malicious way, you understand, just because they are drunk, or a bit daft. On the kitchen counter, people will have lined up their sandwich toasters as if they are at some elaborate cheese-toasting drag race. Goodness only knows what may happen in the course of your university career: you might stroll out with a first, or scrape a third. You might meet the love of your life, make your closest friends, become a student activist. You may go trekking through the Andes, perform on stage, become infatuated with John Donne, or subatomic physics, or American politics. It's up to you. Your university days may or may not be the best days of your life, but they are what you make them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
