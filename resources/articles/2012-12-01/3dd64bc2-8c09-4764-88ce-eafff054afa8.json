But, as Gordon Brown learned while orating on post-neoclassical endogenous growth, the biggest ideas in economics have unsexy names. Thus it is with the nominal GDP target, which Mark Carney, the Bank of England's next governor, floated in a speech this week. As a conversational opener, it was a line worthy of Steve Davis, and yet to those in the know it raises the prospect of restoring much-needed balance to policy. For 20 years now, central bankers have targeted inflation alone. For the first 15 of these, they imagined that securing this single goal would solve every problem, and thereby \u2013 in Mervyn King's phrase \u2013 make policy boring. Since then, let's just say stuff happened. Jumping at every imported price rise does nothing about today's slump; target the level of activity as well as the turnover of cash, and you just might do some good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
