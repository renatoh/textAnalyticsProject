Liverpool play their first knockout game in the competition for nine years at Porto on Wednesday and in confident form judging by the appearance of Klopp and Roberto Firmino at the pre-match press conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Porto are going to be afraid,\u201d said the Brazilian forward at Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o, \u201cbut we are going to make their life difficult and make them suffer.\u201d Klopp bridled at a suggestion that Liverpool, the highest-scoring English team ever in a Champions League group stage this season, could emulate Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side of 2005 and win the trophy for a sixth time. \u201cI don\u2019t like talking about the round after the round you are playing, in fact I hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cI only answer nicely now because I am friendly and we are in public, but if someone asked me about the round after the round in private I would leave the room.\u201d The Liverpool manager was more bullish, however, on his team\u2019s ability to compete with every formidable foe remaining in the competition. He said: \u201cI know already we can compete with them. Probably the strongest team in Europe at the minute is Manchester City. We\u2019ve played them twice and that was at the highest level. PSG is a little bit different but I don\u2019t look at them, I only know already that if we meet them we could beat them. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is but it\u2019s not important. We are here in Porto, that\u2019s the only thing. We can make one big mistake in life \u2013 of course, we as a team would never do that \u2013 but I know when the draw came out it was like: \u2018Thank God, Porto\u2019. But now Porto is here and it\u2019s quite a hurdle, a nice hill we have to go over. It\u2019s interesting. We are confident because of playing good football through the group stage and now we are here; the last 16. \u201cEverything is good about being here; the planes are better, the stadiums are better, the cities are better, even the food is better. So it is cool. You feel it when you come to the press conference \u2013 usually I don\u2019t like it but in a press conference in the Champions League I think it\u2019s a little bit nicer. It\u2019s really exciting and a strong side \u2013 I met Iker Casillas a few minutes ago and you think: \u2018Oh yes! The goalkeeper is not too bad as well!\u2019\u201d The Portuguese league leaders have won 12 of 14 games since their last appearance in the Champions League, a 5-2 win over Monaco, with their only defeat in that sequence coming on penalties against Sporting Lisbon in the cup. Their main concern before Liverpool\u2019s visit is the disruption to the defensive unit that would usually be charged with containing Klopp\u2019s attack. Ivan Marcano has not played since 24 January owing to a thigh injury, his central defensive partner Felipe is suspended and the defensive midfielder Danilo is out with a calf problem. Marcano, however, has declared himself fit. \u201cI am ready if the coach decides I\u2019m going to play,\u201d said the Spanish defender, who described Liverpool as \u201ca complete team\u201d. The Porto manager, S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, claimed last month it was a boost to see his Champions League rivals sell Philippe Coutinho but played down the significance of the transfer on Tuesday. \u201cThey have also bought some more great players so they are still a very strong side,\u201d he said. It is stretching it to say Liverpool are as strong without the player Barcelona bought for \u00a3142m last month but the threat posed by Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Man\u00e9 has not diminished in his absence. Firmino said: \u201cCoutinho is a great player and when he left that put a greater responsibility on everyone else to perform but it is our job to deal with that responsibility.\u201d Only Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Neymar and Edinson Cavani have been more prolific as a pair this season than Firmino and Salah, who are responsible for 49 Liverpool goals between them, compared to 56. Only Cristiano Ronaldo, with nine, has scored more Champions League goals than Firmino this term, the Brazilian\u2019s seven including one in the qualifying round against Hoffenheim. Klopp said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Roberto has stepped up but maybe it is more obvious [what he contributes] because his situations are not overshadowed by Phil Coutinho\u2019s situations. He\u2019s a very important player and he doesn\u2019t always have to be the standout player. I don\u2019t think he is underrated, not anymore. People with a football brain judge him right. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
