He savored the sitcom\u2019s success all the more because it was, famously, \u201cabout nothing\u201d and broke network rules about likeable characters and punchlines. But now the joke is on Mehlman and other liberals who worked on Seinfeld. The show\u2019s billion-dollar revenues enriched and empowered Steve Bannon, an investor-turned political guru who ran the campaign for Donald Trump, another rule-breaker who according to critics knows nothing, and will be his chief White House strategist. Mehlman is aghast that Bannon continues to mint a fortune from Seinfeld royalties. The writer told the Guardian that he felt Bannon had proven himself to be a \u201craging antisemite\u201d, and the fact that he\u2019d made \u201call this money off a show that\u2019s associated with Jewish humor \u2013 that\u2019s pretty galling\u201d. Bannon has rejected claims that he is antisemitic. Breitbart News, which he ran before taking over Trump\u2019s campaign, is strongly pro-Israel. But under Bannon\u2019s stewardship one headline branded the conservative commentator Bill Kristol a \u201crenegade Jew\u201d. Another article called Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum \u201ca Polish, Jewish, American elitist\u201d. In July, Bannon boasted of turning the rightwing site Breitbart News into a \u201cplatform for the alt-right\u201d, a far-right movement in the US. Two weeks after the election, a group of self-described \u201calt-right\u201d leaders met at a conference where they mimicked Nazi language, spoke angrily about Jewish people and said the US belonged to white people. During a contentious divorce in 2007 Bannon\u2019s ex-wife, Mary Louise Piccard, said in a court declaration that he objected to their daughters attending a certain school with many Jewish pupils. \u201cHe said that he doesn\u2019t like the way they raise their kids to be \u2018whiny brats\u2019 and that he didn\u2019t want the girls going to school with Jews,\u201d Piccard wrote. Bannon denied he made the remarks, saying through a spokeswoman that he \u201cproudly\u201d sent the girls to the private school. Mehlman believes there is ample evidence. \u201cIf he\u2019s not antisemitic what do you have to do to be considered antisemitic? Shoot Woody Allen?\u201d The writer said colleagues in Los Angeles were still absorbing Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cPeople are just starting to rouse from an incredible funk. A few sitcom writers in my neigborhood were walking around in a daze for a couple of weeks. It was pretty shocking.\u201d Bannon, a former financier at Goldman Sachs, acquired a share of the royalties from Seinfeld in 1993 as part of the sale of Castle Rock Entertainment to Turner Broadcasting System. The NBC show, which ran for nine seasons from 1989 to 1998, subsequently became a cultural and financial phenomenon. Bannon\u2019s wealth smoothed his path from finance to media and politics. \u201cHe made a ton of money. It was a smart decision,\u201d said Mehlman, who worked with Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David on the show about four neurotic New Yorkers. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make him any less miserable as a human being.\u201d Most of the show\u2019s writers and actors have remained silent on Trump, with a few exceptions. During the campaign Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who played Elaine, and Jason Alexander, who played George, mocked his claims that the Emmys were rigged. After Trump won, Alexander tweeted: \u201cSorry, world. Pray for us.\u201d Almost two decades after the final episode aired, the show remains a cash cow with a record-breaking series of syndication cycles. The size of Bannon\u2019s stake is unclear but just half a percent \u201cmakes you pretty wealthy\u201d, Mehlman said. Affection for Seinfeld seemed undimmed, said the writer. \u201cIn a strange way it\u2019s a tribute to the strength of the show. It\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s saying let\u2019s boycott Seinfeld or stop watching the reruns. I think if [Osama] bin-Laden had said he was a fan people wouldn\u2019t be upset.\u201d Bannon did not respond to an interview request but family and friends defended him, saying media bias had smeared him. \u201cA lot of things have been twisted and it hasn\u2019t been very pleasant,\u201d said Martin Bannon, the strategist\u2019s father. \u201cA lot of the stuff coming out \u2013 they just want to kill the messenger.\u201d John Sullivan, an LA-based documentary maker, said Bannon had Jewish friends and colleagues: \u201cThe antisemitic thing is ridiculous. I don\u2019t recognise this stuff.\u201d Bannon had no creative role in Seinfeld but Melhman said he had joked to a Seinfeld veteran that he had written the Bubble Boy episode. \u201cIt\u2019s generally accepted that words with Bs and Ks are very funny.\u201d Except, maybe, Bannon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
