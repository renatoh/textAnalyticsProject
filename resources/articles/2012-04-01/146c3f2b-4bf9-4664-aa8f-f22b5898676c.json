Results elsewhere thwarted Roberto Mart\u00ednez's hopes of entering a gruelling spell outside the relegation zone but, with a composure and a style epitomised by Victor Moses, his team are pressing forward impressively. Wigan chose an opportune moment to record their first home win since 27 August and back-to-back wins for the first time this season ahead of a trio of fixtures that read Chelsea away, Manchester United at home and Arsenal away. Stoke City are usually no walkover themselves but looked bereft of ideas and energy in comparison to Wigan's confidence on the ball and commanding defence. With greater penetration, the lament of Mart\u00ednez all season, the Latics would have been cruising by the time Antol\u00edn Alcaraz headed home a delightful cross from Jean Beausejour. Throughout they had Moses, who troubled Marc Wilson at will, was always alert to a better placed team-mate and who was quick, strong and skilful enough to dart clear of Andy Wilkinson, round Asmir Begovic in the Stoke goal and complete victory in fitting style in stoppage time. Such confidence reflected a performance in which the cliche about a troubled team battling for survival was not applicable. \"Victor is still a young man,\" said Mart\u00ednez. \"People forget he's only 21 and it has been a big season for him to play so many games. He's also played his first game for Nigeria this season. He is showing real maturity now and the way he took that chance was outstanding. He's shown pieces this season of being a world-class player and its important now that he keeps learning the game and slowly he will get to a position where he can fulfil his potential. He has got fantastic feet and that goal was as good as you will see anywhere.\" This was far from a one-man show, however. From Gary Caldwell in central defence, through James McCarthy and James McArthur in central midfield and Shaun Maloney up front, the former Celtic man bringing his experience to bear against a ponderous Stoke defence, Wigan dominated in every department. Beausejour squandered two sitters yet was instrumental in stifling the supply from Jermaine Pennant to Peter Crouch as Wigan contained and threatened down both flanks. \"They kept everybody quiet, not just the wingers,\" said Tony Pulis, who held back on the criticism following the exertions against Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester City in Stoke's previous four games. \"It was an off day, a poor day at work. Human beings can have those days but we need to go again next week because we have two massive games coming up. The disappointing thing is that we have brought over 2,000 people up here. They have paid good money and we have not performed. The players know how I feel. They have been told and that's it. We move on.\" Man of the match Victor Moses (Wigan Athletic)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
