Frustration was chief among them on the night Albion set an unwanted club record of 16 games without a win while climbing out of the relegation zone. For the second time in four days Liverpool were held at home by a well-drilled defensive unit and Klopp confronted a referee on the final whistle. His team had been on the wrong end of a crucial call once again, with Dominic Solanke having a late goal disallowed for handball, although the Liverpool manager confirmed he approached the referee, Paul Tierney, to complain about the amount of injury time as well as to discuss the substitute\u2019s 82nd-minute effort. Dejan Lovren penalty outrage it was not. Solanke thought he had scored his first Liverpool goal when Joe Gomez\u2019s low cross deflected off Ahmed Hegazi, struck him on the chest and then a raised arm en route to Ben Foster\u2019s goal. Tierney and his assistant decreed otherwise, and rightly so. Alan Pardew\u2019s side rode their luck on occasion but worked tirelessly and defended expertly for a point on the night they set the longest winless streak in the club\u2019s 139-year history. \u201cI looked along the line and the assistant didn\u2019t move, which usually says something is amiss,\u201d the Baggies new manager said. \u201cAfter it has hit Ahmed, Solanke has swung an arm, it\u2019s hit him and gone in. It is a brave call for an assistant referee to make that in front of the Kop; the right decision but still a brave decision. Maybe it was the slice of luck we deserved.\u201d Klopp claimed the ball had struck Solanke\u2019s chest but was unsure about the arm. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few replays, there\u2019s an arm, but I\u2019m not sure he touches the ball. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not on purpose. It must be a really good assistant that made the decision. He will be happy if there was a hand involved. That\u2019s another moment where we had no luck.\u201d A Solanke shot that was cleared off the line by Hegazi moments later was another although, to use Klopp\u2019s words, this was a \u201cstiff\u201d and \u201cstatic\u201d Liverpool performance. Their \u201crotated four\u201d \u2013 Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Emre Can and Georginio Wijnaldum \u2013 were back in the starting line-up after being benched against Everton. The rest did not inspire an urgent or incisive display and Klopp spent much of the first half imploring his front two, Firmino and Mohamed Salah, to switch places more frequently to break an Albion defence marshalled superbly by Jonny Evans. Alongside him Hegazi was also commanding. Salah pierced Pardew\u2019s back-line with an exquisite diagonal ball across the Albion penalty area towards Firmino. Allan Nyom\u2019s failure to intercept offered the Brazilian a clear sight of goal but his first-time shot sailed beyond both Foster and the far post. That was as close as Liverpool came to breaking the deadlock before half-time. Salah was a foot away from connecting with an inviting cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold that sailed behind Hegazi, his international team-mate, and Coutinho shot straight at Foster from distance. Otherwise Liverpool\u2019s attacking play lacked its usual urgency and rhythm with Sadio Man\u00e9 struggling to get involved. Albion, though reverting to a back six at times, did not sit deep for the entirety of the contest and struck the bar when Hal Robson-Kanu curled a 25-yard effort over Loris Karius, deputising for Simon Mignolet, who suffered a swollen ankle against Everton. The visitors were also a threat from Grzegorz Krychowiak\u2019s set-pieces. Claudio Yacob forced Karius to save well with a glancing header from a corner by the impressive Poland midfielder \u2013 \u201che showed his international class,\u201d said Pardew \u2013 and Hegazi should have done better with another delivery to the back post. Thereafter it was back to absorbing Liverpool pressure for Albion. Klopp\u2019s team built up ominous momentum in the second half but the all-important breakthrough eluded them. Their manager was more resigned than incandescent this time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
