Our class of 12 continued after that, with Diana an active participant until mid-2019. She was a perceptive and generous critic of our biographies. Never vaunting her own expertise, she welcomed us as readers and critics of her two most recent biographies, published in 2019. The Casson Family in North Wales charted her own family, but it was her production of Sam Wanamaker: A Global Performer in just over a year that showed her incredible energy and skill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
