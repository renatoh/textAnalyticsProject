Not just a victory against one of Europe\u2019s heavyweights with their Champions League season still just about guttering with life. But a night of redemption and role reversal on a cinematic scale. First of all it was a night of very un-\u00d6zil-like personal glory for Arsenal\u2019s record signing, scorer of the second goal that clinched this defeat of Germany\u2019s champions. Mesut \u00d6zil, we\u2019re told, doesn\u2019t do the obvious. This is a player who operates on a plane beyond the hackneyed theatre of goals and assists, but who is instead a kind of elite engineer, greasing the component parts, conducting only distantly, above the meaty-pawed fray. Here, though, \u00d6zil did the opposite, claiming the big-type headlines from a game in which he only flickered, producing moments of brilliance on the ball, waiting until the final minute to turn in H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn\u2019s pass at the far post and give the night its gloss. It was a goal that will exorcise a little the memory of \u00d6zil\u2019s worst moment for Arsenal, that horribly meek eighth\u2013minute penalty 18 months ago on the same ground against the same opponents that has been a weapon in the quiver of those who fret at the German\u2019s occasionally distant influence, those frail, gossamer skills. A moment of dramatic redemption then, but part of a wider process too. Whisper it \u2013 shhhh, don\u2019t jinx it \u2013 but \u00d6zil is in the middle of a serious purple patch, moving in sync with his team-mates, playing with a real sense of joy and continuity, and buoyed by Theo Walcott\u2019s movement in front of him in a central role. In the buildup to this game J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng had echoed the suggestion of \u00d6zil\u2019s most partisan fans that Arsenal\u2019s frail alien princeling has the talent to be considered among the world\u2019s very best; a player who, when he finds his gears running smoothly, is a unique, delightfully high-spec presence. Well, you said it, J\u00e9r\u00f4me. For all Bayern\u2019s velvet-glove strangulation in the first quarter of the match, this was a supremely well-conceived and executed victory. But it was also a night of altered fortunes for many others on the pitch. If Fortuna\u2019s wheel seemed to have turned for \u00d6zil, it spun right round for Manuel Neuer in the space of 40 minutes. For a while it looked as though Neuer would be the decisive figure here as Bayern\u2019s keeper produced a first-half save from Walcott that will live long in the memory. Arsenal had just begun to breathe in the game. Alexis S\u00e1nchez, a furiously angry leader of the counterattack, had begun to run through Bayern\u2019s occasionally static central midfield. S\u00e1nchez released Nacho Monreal and his cross was perfectly flighted for Walcott to head the ball in. Collapsing his right leg under him, Bayern\u2019s goalkeeper dived across and back, extending his shoulder, his arm, his elbow, his wrist, his fingertips and then clawing the ball away from behind him, a save with a degree of instant mental physics about it, the kind of peripheral vision catch that only the best slip fielder can manage. And yet it was Neuer\u2019s horrible error \u2013 with Bayern already fading a little, caught up in their own embroidery \u2013 that turned the game Arsenal\u2019s way. Santi Cazorla pumped a free-kick in towards the six yard box with 13 minutes remaining. Neuer leapt to punch, missed it completely and the ball trickled over the goal-line off at least two parts of Olivier Giroud\u2019s body, the last apparently his hand. Redemption and role reversal again. Neuer misses his punch. Giroud, at the end of a horribly troubled few weeks, punches it into the goal. Elsewhere on the pitch there were other minor triumphs against the head. In the first half Beller\u00edn appeared to have been subjected to some kind of insidious hypnotic spell at the hands of Douglas Costa, twice tackling shadows as Bayern\u2019s left-winger made him look, for the first time in a long time, like a 20-year-old full-back. By the end Beller\u00edn, who is a seriously uplifting footballer, had regrouped, recalibrated, problem-solved, pressing Costa aggressively and sprinting down his flank like Garrincha to create \u00d6zil\u2019s moment at the end. Finally, of course, there was Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Arsenal\u2019s manager has suffered in this campaign, damned by his own lukewarm selections. Here though he got it absolutely right, out-manoeuvring Guardiola\u2019s fluid Bayern team. Arsenal started cold, dropping deep and defending slightly perilously against the waves of possession. For a while Robert Lewandowski\u2019s movement was mesmerising, all lean, angular, bionic thrust against Per Mertesacker, who for all his fine qualities turns with all the athletic grace of a broken shopping trolley. Mertesacker dropped deep, giving himself time, funnelling his man wide. Bayern passed, and passed. And Passed. But then Arsenal began to break, S\u00e1nchez carrying the ball across the halfway line three abreast with Walcott and Aaron Ramsey like a men\u2019s 60-metre heat. By the end the turnaround was complete, for now at least. Arsenal have some way to go still in Group F. The suspicion is a few more twists await them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
