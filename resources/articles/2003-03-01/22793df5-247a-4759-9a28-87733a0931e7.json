Details of the private conversation were revealed by Granada TV today after the Duchess accused the ITV presenter of \"tricking\" Princess Diana into \"a comfort zone\" to elicit answers on some of the most sensitive areas of her life, including her relationship with Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles. \"We are somewhat surprised at the Duchess of York's comments, made on American daytime show The View, particularly as Granada received a call from her office the day after transmission of the 'Living with Michael Jackson' documentary. Sarah Ferguson had asked her assistant to pass on her personal congratulations to Martin,\" said a spokesman. He said he had taken the call personally and remembered vividly how Fergie wanted Bashir to know the film was \"brilliant\". However, she had changed her tune yesterday when she appeared on the American chat show. She claimed Bashir had used the same dubious techniques he had used on Diana to persuade her to open up. \"I don't understand how Martin Bashir can sit there and say, 'I'm a family man, you're a family man. This is great' - and then Jackson says 'you tricked me'. I think I've got a tarnished view, coming from Britain where they are the most ruthless tabloid journalists in the world.\" Fergie's comments will be seized upon by Jackson who accused Bashir of betraying his trust with the documentary. Footage the superstar released for his own documentary shows Bashir complimenting Jackson on his marvellous parenting skills and referring to tabloid newspaper reports about plastic surgery as \"disgusting, disgusting\" as part of his bid to prove to the pop star he was his ally. While the Diana interview made Bashir's name and helped him clinch the deal with Jackson, many believed she had gone into the interview with her eyes open, even getting prior counselling on the use of famous phrases, such as \"three in my marriage\". Today Bashir laughed off the latest attack. \"Martin absolutely rejects any suggestion that he 'tricked' the Princess of Wales,\" said the spokesman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
