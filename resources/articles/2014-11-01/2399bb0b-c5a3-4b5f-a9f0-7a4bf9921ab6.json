It\u2019s the eighth and final match of a short-form series between Australia and the loose collection of Caribbean islands known as the West Indies, and the locals are well on top. It\u2019s just past midday and Australia are 3 for 127 in 30 overs, with two big guns on deck \u2013 all-round superstar Ellyse Perry on 20, and slashing opening bat and captain, Meg Lanning, on 43. And cricket nerdos could watch them all day. Lanning\u2019s batting, particularly, is copybook-attractive. High left elbow, timing, grace, balance, poise, the fluent co-ordination of the natural sporto. And she hits it hard, the ball \u201cthocking\u201d off the middle of the bat with that particular meaty cricket noise of Kookaburra on Gray-Nicholls twin-scoop, or whatever weapons they\u2019re whacking about with today, and whistles across Bradman\u2019s billiard table surface. Bowral? Tidy little town. You can get a Devonshire Tea in Bowral, and buy an antique. A nice bureau, say, or an old chaise lounge. You could visit the Bradman Museum, if you were of a mind, it\u2019s adjacent this delightful oval of the same name. Don Bradman grew up in Bowral, spending untold hours whacking a golf ball against a corrugated iron water tank, developing the preternatural eye and concentration of the run-freak. Doesn\u2019t sound like he had a lot of mates. What? Did someone just sledge the Don? Mayhap they did. The great man was not without barnacles, as none of us are, except for Dennis Lillee. Bradman Oval sports a tight, green surface mowed in concentric circles, with fine big trees dotting the perimeter. There\u2019s a tree-filled escarpment to the east over the ground. Does it have the majesty of Cape Town\u2019s Table Mountain? No, it does not. But it\u2019s not a bad little escarpment, a forested chunk of grey-black rock. And the ground is delightful. Delightful like a friand, say, or a funny gay play. People lounge on deckchairs in that somnolent funk particular to the cricket fan and heroin users on the nod, the one that says I don\u2019t care what\u2019s on the television but I\u2019m here watching, and enjoying it. People knit. People keep score. For the cricket fan, and we are legion, lying back slumped in a deck chair, refreshment in hand, sort of absorbing the soft ebb and flow of a game of cricket \u2026 it\u2019s almost meditative, with moments of Top Excitement that can jolt one from one\u2019s seat \u2026 woah! How about that? And then you slump back. And repeat. The West Indians? Typically cool and exotic names. Chaquinta Quinton bowls quick and bats number six. Deandra Dottin bats number five and flings the ball from the boundary like it\u2019s shot out a cannon. Shakera Selman is tall and quick, and languid like a long drink in a hammock. But they bowl a lot of pies. And the Aussies feast like fat kids. The crowd? There might be a hundred people. Lot of kids. The girls from the Army, Navy and Air Force are here. Families, locals. Maybe a dozen brightl bibbed security men, standing about, practicing for a day when they might have something to do. Cracker of a day, a sky-blue peach. The most recent game last Sunday it was 35C with a 50-knot southerly, player\u2019s comfort level akin to playing cricket inside Jacquie Lambie\u2019s brain. And so to drinks and Australia are 3/151 in 34 overs. A security man lumbers onto the field, build of a massive pavlova, a man more superfluous than a brassiere on a Brahman bull. Not that superfluous. But superfluous, man. Superfluous. Back into it and \u2026 power play! That means the Windies can only put three fielders outside the inner white circle, a sentence lost anyway on non-cricket fans, not sure why I explained it. But what it means is this: The Windies best prepare to chase some leather. And it looks like the Windies know it. Their body language is that of kids in the field on a hot summer\u2019s day. Boom! Lanning smites a cover-drive along the turf for four. Boom! A lofted drive is cracked over mid-off, one bounce, four runs. She clips one off her toes, bottom of the bat, and it\u2019s four more through mid-wicket. When she pulls a short ball to the square leg fence you know this: technically you can\u2019t bat better, man, woman, cricket-playing kangaroo. It\u2019s pure, copybook batsmanship. top stuff, Meg Lanning. Full toss - boom, over mid-wicket. Lanning is 80. Australia 3/190 with 11 overs to go. And the Windies\u2019 fielding dies in the arse. Balls go for four through sweaty palms. It\u2019s game eight of a series they\u2019ve been belted, pillar to post. A wide brings up the Lanning-Perry hundred partnership in 95 balls. I take off for a wander. Giant security pavlova man instructs me not to go on the field. I wasn\u2019t on the field, nor looking like I was going to go on the field. Why would I go on the field? Was it a pre-emptive strike? Does the man have nothing to do? Had he read my notes? And what would he do if I did go on the field? You could run faster than him while pushing a Pajero bogged in a swamp. The silly moo. Over to the scoreboard, a quaint and hand-operated job from days of yore. I take some photos of it, and a fellow scoring. A bloke in an official pink shirt tells me, \u201cYou can\u2019t just stand in front of the scoreboard. Happy for you to take some photos after play.\u201d \u201cNo worries,\u201d I reply. And stab him in the face with a scimitar! No I don\u2019t. But my, let\u2019s consider old mate\u2019s request. There\u2019s maybe two hundred people here, all of whom can see the scoreboard over my head. I wasn\u2019t likely to set up shop in front of the damned thing. Do I have a sign on my head that says, \u201cTell this person what to do.\u201d? Wicket! Lanning mistimes a drive and is caught in the deep. Alyssa Healy comes in. And then is gone. Caught. Aussies wobble? Against fellow world-power England, maybe. Against these West Indians they just send in some more top batters to slash and burn. Perry smashes an off-drive, hardest she\u2019ll hit the ball today. Pure, hard, out of the screws. Jess Jonassen smashes a six long down the ground. And does it again! Over midwicket and into the gaggle of service girls who dive on the ball and fight over it, laughing their heads off. Australia, you funny big lug of a country, you beauty. And so Australia finish 5 for 275 and it\u2019s off to the airy outdoor press box to write. The West Indies openers swing early. Bunch of boundaries. Then \u2026 wicket! Kycia Knight is caught at first slip. In comes Brittany Cooper. And so the Windies swing and they hit, and they miss and it\u2019s clear these top-order batters can play. But there aren\u2019t enough of them. Perry\u2019s and Megan Schutt\u2019s swingers \u2013 a couple of which hoop in like those golden devil-ball things that Harry Potter had to fight in Quidditch \u2013 take seven of the nine wickets to fall. Perry will be player of the match and the series. Super cricketer. And as you\u2019re leaving, you see them: a group of tween girls eating icy-poles and waiting for the Aussie girls to come out. When I was a kid girls played cricket by fielding in groups at long on, plaiting their hair and making dandelion necklaces. Today they line up for Ellyse Perry\u2019s autograph. Top stuff. And if you\u2019re looking for a reason Australia should play West Indies in women\u2019s cricket, there you are. Good luck to them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
