Yesterday, in the world of rowing, the equivalent scenario developed. Leander, Britain's premier rowing club was told that it could no longer enter three of Henley Royal Regatta's prestigious club-based events. The news represents a body-blow to Leander, who until now have used their financial muscle to attract and develop Britain's best young prospects, as well as supporting top under 23 rowers and Olympians like Peter Reed and Steve Williams, who took gold as part of the British four this year in Beijing. Yesterday, Mark Banks, Leander's chief coach, broke the news to members of his squad preparing for next year's Thames Cup, one of the three events affected. And he explained that his men were stunned: \"For my part it's awful. There was just a blank look on their faces. Ten out of 15 of these guys are still novices,\" said Banks. And the man who was half of the coaching partnership which took Britain's eight to a silver in Beijing went on to explain that the average age of those men who would be affected was just 20. He said: \"These rowers are not from the club's intermediate or full-international ranks, they are freshers and should be allowed their chance to race in the club-standard events.\" But Banks's views cut no ice with Mike Sweeney, the chairman of Henley Royal Regatta. And he pointed to Leander's recent successes in the Regatta's lower standard club-based events, like the Thames Cup, as a sign that he had to act. \"Leander is not a normal club. It has an aggressive recruitment policy, and requires its rowers to train six days a week from 7am until midday,\" he said. \"That's not something any other British Club can compete with.\" Sweeney's views found immediate support from a former Leander Club member, Pete Mulkerrens, currently men's chief coach at Star Club in Bedford. And the former British Olympian explained: \"It's a great decision. At last in the club events it will be a level playing field and my boys who have to work full time and train round their jobs won't be competing against Leander's full-time rowers.\" Those are sentiments that are likely to be echoed around most, if not all of Britain's other rowing clubs and while Sweeney was sympathetic to the disappointment of Leander's rowers he encouraged them to be realistic and aim to enter only Henley's higher status events: \"Henley Regatta has 19 events and Leander Club can still enter 16 of them. I would encourage them to aim higher.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
