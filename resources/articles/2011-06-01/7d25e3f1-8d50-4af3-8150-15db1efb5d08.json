Indeed, it is said Freud has had more money spent on his media training than any other minister so far \u2013 about \u00a32,115. Hardly anybody thinks he's much improved. Of course we know the justice ministry did the same, though as we reported last month, Ken Clarke \u2013 whose PR skills have been there for all to see of late \u2013 absented himself. The business department spent \u00a32,800, the Department of Health another \u00a3500 for Lord Howe to have a \"try not roll your eyes too much\" training session. Nothing for Voldemort Lansley, but that's obvious. All this money spent on honing the message and helping the messengers. Can anyone say why communications from a government run by a former PR man are such a sorry mess? \u2022 For the PM is floundering. Yet for all that effort, Ed Miliband doesn't seem able to lay a glove on him. No wonder the troops are getting worried. Worried that he is not cutting through, and in the face of multiple crises, worried about the party's sense of priorities. Not least the unusually insistent text message they received from the whips' office on Wednesday morning. \"Would colleagues please attend NOW Rob Flello's debate in Westminster Hall on wild animals in circuses,\" it said. \u2022 No sign of a thaw, meanwhile, between Alastair Campbell and the hacks who gave him such a hard time. \"There are some journalists I would not have in my house \u2013 like I would not have dogshit in there,\" said Alastair, during the presentation of the Charles Wheeler award at Westminster University on Wednesday. Still, some get a better reception than others, especially those who dabble in politics. Thus Ally looked comfortable chewing the fat with one late arrival, Wheeler's son-in-law Boris Johnson. Johnson, also known as the mayor of London, had that day accompanied police on a dawn raid to apprehend a suspected burglar. \"I felt quite sorry for the guy,\" said Boris. \"He woke up to a great commotion early in the morning, and who did he see at the end of the bed but me!\" \u2022 And what was Boris doing there, exactly? Well, he was part of a Scotland Yard initiative. Experienced detectives were told about it on the force intranet. \"Met targets crime in huge crackdown,\" the message said. No wonder they are excited. \u2022 So what did happen when former Tory minister David Mellor and another paying guest had heated words during a performance at the Royal Opera House? Hard to know, because we weren't there, but for his part Mellor says he became angry with the other party, who talked during the performance. Darkly, the former Foreign Office minister warns the Daily Telegraph that he will sue if it says different. But quite the best element of the whole affair is the fact that his line is later finessed by his PR adviser Neil Wallis. Yes Neil \"Wolfman\" Wallis, who was Andy Coulson's number two at the News of the World during the ongoing, on-growing hacking scandal. Still, Mellor clearly does need advice. One likes to think that had he told Wallis of his intention to go on to the Today programme and suck up to the rulers of Bahrain just as they started cracking heads during pro-democracy protests in Pearl Square, the Wolfman would have said no. \u2022 Finally, a top tip from Kelvin MacKenzie. \"I've finally found a use for the Guardian \u2013 I've been holding it over my head during the showers,\" said Kelvin in his Sun column yesterday. All a bit strange. For on the evening of publication, he also said on Sky News that our revelations about private investigator Jonathan Rees and his dark deeds on behalf of the yellow press were \"massively serious\". Still, whatever Kelvin says, it's not a problem. At least he bought the paper. To read about phone hacking at News International, one assumes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
