While Melvyn Bragg's latest title is Twelve Books That Changed the World, a personal list of the most influential British publications in history, a recent University of London study into the most influential novels in people's lives assembled its own list of milestone literature. At a cultural moment like this, it is not unnatural for a writer to run an eye along their own bookshelves and see which titles leap out, declaiming their unbridled influence. As a youth I had a soft spot for Tolstoy's War and Peace. I'd have stuck that book at the top of my list. I was romantic and impressionable, and a lot of folk had told me that it was the greatest novel ever written. With its astonishing breadth of characters, geography and incident, they remarked, it is the only book that truly provides a complete snapshot of a society. I was told that all human life was in the book, and I thought it was true. But from my current vantage point I feel a little differently. While War and Peace is certainly a tidy read, for my money Tolstoy's ego pokes through every page and the motivation for writing the book seems to boil down to proving that Napoleon was a dick and that Tolstoy is smarter. Besides, it's all counts and princes and horse racing and palaces and summer estates, and the peasants are rendered as soulful drudges, wedded to the land. War and Peace has a blind side, which is this: about 95% of the population is missing. So, if you want a book that truly offers a snapshot of an entire society, that gets into every single niche of a culture's activity, that relates the giddying variety of human life, I'd go for the Reader's Digest book How to Do Just About Anything. My pal Tom saw a copy in a charity shop in Devon last summer and picked it up for me. Simply reading the alphabetically listed headings of the entries will give you a sense of the extraordinary breadth of this modern classic. Here's one from the Cs: crazy paving; credit cards; crepes suzettes; cribbage. Or take these Ms: modelling in clay; moles; mops and mopping; morse code; mortar. Get these Ss: stamp duty; staple gun; stargazing; steaming; stencilling. Obedience training; obscene telephone calls; oil changing. Quilting; quinces; quoits. I can't stop. Rock gardens; roller skating; roman blinds. It's immense. Spectacles; spices; spider plants. It's all there. These are just some of the mainstream entries, but the Digest's relentless cataloguing of our culture doesn't confine itself to quotidian experiences. It also pushes the limits of likelihood. Now nobody I know has ever seen any quicksand in this country, but so committed to a total rendering of human experience is the guide that we have this entry: Quicksand - what to do if you are trapped. Handy, I'm sure you'll agree. Especially since you'll no doubt have the book on you should you ever fall into quicksand - and be able to get it from your bag and read it. Still, the advice contained within the quicksand entry is even more niche than the title suggests: \"If you are wearing ... a cape, leave it on; it may increase your buoyancy.\" A cape? Who wears capes? Very few people, but that doesn't mean that the guide will ignore society's cape wearers, in the way that Tolstoy blanks the peasants. He didn't manage to shoehorn quicksand and capes into War and Peace, did he? And I see no references to string art, tennis elbow, fondue or begonias in Tolstoy's opus. War and Peace is not a bad little book, but How to Do Just About Anything absolutely panels it. Any chance of a baker's dozen, Melvyn?
