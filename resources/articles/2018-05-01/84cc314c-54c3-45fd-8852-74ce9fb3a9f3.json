The Fijian winger Vereniki Goneva has been named player of the season while Dean Richards picked up the best director of rugby award at this year\u2019s ceremony in London. Goneva topped a shortlist also featuring Wasps\u2019 Danny Cipriani, Exeter\u2019s Don Armand, Sale\u2019s Faf de Klerk and Northampton\u2019s Jamie Gibson, having finished as the league\u2019s joint highest try-scorer with 13 tries. The 34-year-old was released by Leicester in 2016 but has been enjoying a fresh lease of life in the north-east. \u201cWhen I first met him for a chat two years ago in Betty\u2019s Tea Room in Harrogate I couldn\u2019t believe how fortunate we were to be signing such a quality guy as well as an amazing player,\u201d said Richards. \u201cHe defies the ageing process with the physical condition he keeps himself in, he is a phenomenal athlete but also has a thorough understanding of the game and how he can influence it. He is right up there in the world-class bracket when it comes to finishing.\u201d Richards has also been recognised for guiding the Falcons to within two victories of lifting the trophy for the first time in two decades. His side will have to beat the defending champions, Exeter Chiefs, on Saturday to reach the final but have already enjoyed their best season since the distant era of Sir John Hall, Rob Andrew and Jonny Wilkinson. The Falcons also collected the award for try of the season, Sinoti Sinoti\u2019s mazy run against Exeter at Kingston Park being adjudged the best. Sinoti\u2019s try was among a record 776 tries scored in the Premiership this season, beating the previous mark of 750 in 1999-2000. Exeter\u2019s director of rugby, Rob Baxter, has stressed his Chiefs players will deserve to finish empty-handed if they are remotely complacent in the semi-final against Newcastle at Sandy Park. The Chiefs will start favourites having topped the regular-season table but Baxter says his side should assume absolutely nothing. \u201cIf we lose on Saturday, is anyone going to talk about us finishing top of the table in five years\u2019 time? Of course they\u2019re not,\u201d warned Baxter. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t deserve to start talking about winning back-to-back finals. We haven\u2019t yet dealt with the next hurdle, which is beating Newcastle. \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from it, there is complacency among other people. There are bound to be those saying: \u2018Exeter don\u2019t lose a lot of home games and semi-finals tend to be won by the home team,\u2019 but most players deal with that pretty well. If we go out on the field and we\u2019re complacent we\u2019ll deserve to lose. I would have no complaints about that, it would be our mistake.\u201d Meanwhile, the England women\u2019s forwards coach Matt Ferguson is to join Northampton Saints this summer as assistant coach."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
