The prime minister, whose government has clashed with the Church of England over the direction and severity of policy, said the changes it had made since the last election should likewise not be seen as \u201camoral\u201d. Writing in the magazine Premier Christianity he said that the economy had been the area of government most in need of political leadership in the past five years, and was proud of having made \u201cclear choices to help the poorest paid and most vulnerable in society\u201d. In a swipe at his ecclesiastical critics, he wrote: \u201cI know that some disagree with those policies \u2013 including a number within the Church of England. But I would urge those individuals not to dismiss the people who proposed those policies as devoid of morality \u2013 or assume those policies are somehow amoral themselves. \u201cAs Winston Churchill said after the death of his opponent, Neville Chamberlain, in the end we are all guided by the lights of our own reason. \u2018The only guide to a man is his own conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions.\u2019\u201d The church has recently voiced its disquiet over government reforms to the economy and welfare. In an unprecedented intervention in February the House of Bishops published a joint open letter warning that \u201cour democracy is failing\u201d and attacking the \u201cgrowing appetite to exploit grievances\u201d and \u201cfind scapegoats\u201d in society. The letter outlined its hopes for political parties to discern \u201ca fresh moral vision of the kind of country we want to be\u201d before next month\u2019s general election. The prime minister\u2019s Easter message may quote Winston Churchill, but the piece does not mention Jesus once. In it Cameron admits he is \u201chardly a model church-going, God-fearing Christian\u201d and that he is \u201ca bit hazy on the finer points of our faith\u201d. But he added that his faith had helped him in tough times and reminded him \u201cabout what really matters and how to be a better person, father and citizen\u201d. He added that Christian values \u201care the values on which our nation was built\u201d and describes himself as an \u201cunapologetic supporter of the role of faith in this country\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
