Damp, overcast skies and slow pitches have hardly been conducive to tweakers and Such will not have gleaned much from the two sessions he watched from the top of the bank here on Thursday. True, Monty Panesar bowled with his customary accuracy and picked up two wickets but Such knows all about the Sussex, and occasionally England, left-arm spinner who got the biggest cheer of the day when he embarrassingly failed to back up a return and the ball trickled over the boundary for four overthrows. By the time Durham's leggie, Scott Borthwick, came on to bowl 15 minutes before stumps Such was on his way home. But at least he saw the 22-year-old enhance his reputation as an all-rounder with his first Championship fifty of the season as Durham garnered an unexpected batting point, only their ninth of the season. Borthwick counterattacked impressively as Durham rallied from 175 for eight thanks to his ninth-wicket stand of 55 in 10 overs with Mitch Claydon. For the first time in the match bat dominated ball and, although Chris Nash ended the fun with two wickets in four balls, Durham's score of 231 was competitive in seam-friendly conditions, as their attack soon demonstrated. There is no Graham Onions, Liam Plunkett or Steve Harmison here but their understudies proved more than capable as the ball darted around. Chris Rushworth, in only his third Championship appearance of the season, reeled off four maidens with the new ball and picked up Nash with a ball that nipped back. Calum Thorp then stepped up with two wickets in 12 balls. Joe Gatting was leg-before when half-forward while the beauty which defeated Luke Wells's forward push and clipped the top of his off bail would have beaten most batsmen. Murray Goodwin and Mike Yardy needed all their experience to prevent further inroads. If Durham do claim their first win of the season they will be grateful for the obduracy shown by Dale Benkenstein who grafted for more than three hours for his 43 after the early loss of Paul Collingwood to the persevering Steve Magoffin. The Australian returned to the attack to have Benkenstein caught at midwicket off a mistimed pull, his first false shot. Magoffin beat the bat on countless occasions and might easily have finished with five or six wickets. There is something of Andy Caddick in his long-striding approach, though without the express pace, but this game might yet be decided by a batsman on either side who can master these bowler-friendly conditions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
