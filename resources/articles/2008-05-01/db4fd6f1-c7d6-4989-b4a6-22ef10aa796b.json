Hornby, the venerable maker of model railways, moved into the car business yesterday when it added Corgi to its burgeoning box of British toy brands in the hope of once again making the die-cast metal models as sought after as they were in their heyday. Over the past few years Hornby, based in Margate, Kent, has been single-handedly revitalising the British \"heritage\" toy industry, gathering up companies which in the 1960s and 70s would have accounted for the entire contents of most boys' bedroom cupboards. Alongside its eponymous train sets, which first appeared in 1920, the firm now owns Scalextric, which first hit the road in 1952. Two years ago, Hornby added Airfix, the plastic model firm that can trace its origins back to the start of World War II, to its collection. It also snapped up Humbrol paints, founded in 1919 and used by generations of model makers to colour their creations. Now Hornby is paying \u00a37.5m to Corgi's US owners to bring a company that had fallen on hard times back to the UK. \"We are pulling together the hobby elements of the British toy industry,\" said Hornby chief executive Frank Martin. \"We know there is huge untapped demand out there.\" The company hopes it can capitalise on the booming collectors' market in toy cars. In the mid-60s, Corgi began tying up merchandising deals with film and TV studios, creating replicas of cars seen in James Bond films and TV shows including Batman and the Avengers. These deals continued into the 70s and 80s with replicas made from US shows such as Starsky and Hutch and Kojak and homegrown dramas including The Saint and The Professionals. These TV and film tie-in models are now highly collectable, according to Simon Epton, of the magazine Diecast Collector: a pristine, boxed 1960s Corgi Batmobile was recently sold at auction for \u00a3900. \"Toys are an enormous business these days,\" he said. \"There are thousands and thousands of collectors but people have also locked onto the fact that they can buy a \u00a3100 toy as a great investment. It's better than money in the bank at the moment. There are a number of people I know of who have invested tens of thousands of pounds on a portfolio of toys.\" The online auction site eBay, for instance, yesterday had almost 10,000 Corgi items for sale ranging from replicas of the cars driven by the characters John Steed and Emma Peel in The Avengers - a Bentley and Lotus Elan S2 - for \u00a3999 and a collection of 80 Eddie Stobart trucks for \u00a3900, to a battered version of a John Player Special-sponsored Lotus formula one car for \u00a32.99. It is this merchandising opportunity that Hornby hopes to use to revitalise the Corgi name over the coming years. The company has already scored major successes with tie-in replicas for its other toy brands. Its Hornby version of the Hogwart's Express from Harry Potter and its Airfix kits that link with BBC's Doctor Who have both scored successes. Sales of Scalextric, meanwhile, leapt 30% last year thanks to version of the car driven by formula one contender Lewis Hamilton. Corgi, by contrast, has been starved of investment over the past two decades as it has changed hands time and again. Sales of Corgi cars have plunged from about \u00a320m in 1999 to just \u00a36.5m last year. \"Corgi has not really had the hands-on close attention that a brand of that sort should have,\" Martin said. Actual production of Corgi cars was moved to southern China in the 80s and the replicas are produced in a factory just down the road from Hornby's own facilities where it makes train and Scalextric sets. But Corgi also outsourced a lot of its design work, apart from a small team in Leicester. Martin intends to beef up UK design team: \"We design cars for Scalextric and aircraft for Airfix and the same design and engineering information is directly applicable, although in a different scale, to the Corgi business\". Hornby is also spending a further \u00a3800,000 buying up Corgi's inventory, as well as current models still sitting in warehouses. This includes the Corgi archive which contains a copy of every single model ever made by the firm. \"That is a very valuable heritage archive,\" Martin said. \"We have said for a long time that we should have a Hornby heritage museum and with this deal that museum is rapidly turning into the UK hobby heritage museum. We would like, probably in Margate, to have a museum that pulls together all the different strands we are in. At least, that's the hope.\" Backstory Corgi Cars were created in 1956 by Northampton-based Mettoy Playcraft. They took their name from the Corgi breed of dog not just because it is the Queen's favourite, but because it has links with Wales where the cars were originally manufactured. There were already established names such as Dinky and Matchbox vying for space in the nation's toy boxes, but Corgi had the technological advantage, according to toy historian Arthur Ward. \"Before the war, Dinky had the market but post-war you have Matchbox and Corgi. Corgi was famous by the early 1960s because they had windows while Dinky and Matchbox did not, they were just metal castings. ... Dinky was always a little bit more expensive because the models were larger, while Matchbox was famous for the smaller pocket-money type toys.\" Perhaps Corgi's most famous model is James Bond's gold-painted Aston Martin DB5, featuring an ejector seat and front-mounted machine guns. The firm had sold more than 3.9m by 1968. Other best-sellers include the 1966 Batmobile and the Lotus Formula One car."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
