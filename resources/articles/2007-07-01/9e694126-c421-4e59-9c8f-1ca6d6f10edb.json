The only things I can grow are trailing ivy and bedding geraniums. Can you recommend a climber with flowers and a sweet scent, and any other suitable plants? The cultivars of Clematis alpina and C. macropetala are real little toughies - the species hails from Siberia and Mongolia, so they should cope with whatever your balcony can throw at them. They produce delicate, nodding flowers early in the year, followed by lovely, fluffy seedheads in late summer. With an eventual height of around 2m, they're perfectly balcony-sized, too. The only drawback is that they are not scented. Deep-pink flowered Clematis alpina 'Constance' is the one fragrant exception, but it's only lightly so. Other plants to try include carex, agapanthus, crocosmia, cordylines, dwarf phormiums, and lavender and rosemary for that elusive scent. You say geraniums have done well in the past, so try scented geraniums, too. I'm a gardening beginner and my plants are being attacked. Books say to import an army of beneficial bugs, pick off slugs at night or spray nasty poisons. Is it really this difficult? Should I give up now? It is easy to get your knickers in a twist when starting out, but you can't be Alan Titchmarsh from day one. It takes time to build up the experience that makes all that complicated stuff second nature. Stick to the organic way, if you can. An abundance of wildlife makes it easier in the long run (the goodies take care of the baddies eventually, honest). Forget about tackling every problem and concentrate first on the biggies: slugs and snails. They do the most obvious and heartbreaking damage. On your night raids, try copper slug rings (01225 851524; slugrings.co.uk) and an exciting new organic slug pellet called Growing Success Advanced Slug Killer (from organiccatalog.com; 0845 1301304). Otherwise, chill out - the rest will come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
