I don't make much of the new labels, I must say, but the wines inside the bottles seem, by and large, decent enough. Of those I came across at a recent Sainsbury's tasting, I particularly enjoyed, among the whites, the brisk subtlety of the Pouilly Fum\u00e9 2005 (\u00a38.99), from France; the gentle, apricot lift of the Albari\u00f1o 2005 (\u00a35.99), from Spain; and the Chablis Cuv\u00e9e Ste Celine 2005 (\u00a37.99), from France. In fact, chablis is my new favourite, and it is a hard wine to get right, but this particular incarnation has a spirit-lifting freshness and a distinct mineral quality. Of the reds, I loved the deep, dark, heat-absorbing Douro 2004 (\u00a36.99), from Portugal, which is a 14% abv whopper made by the much-feted Quinta do Crasto in the port-producing Douro Valley, just upstream from Oporto - it's interesting to see that someone out there thinks even those wine drinkers who like to buy, uncork and drain their glass without fussing too much about wine scholarship should have this region on their rough world wine map. The focused and restrained Coonawarra Cabernet 2002 (\u00a36.99), from Australia, is also a lovely wine, as I think I've said before, though don't hang on to it for long before opening. There were also two wines in the range that I wasn't at all keen on: the Marlborough Sauvignon 2005 (\u00a36.49), from New Zealand, and especially the Saint Emilion 2004 (\u00a37.99), from France. This latter is made by a big brand called Dourthe, which makes its bordeaux as if it's trying to say to people who don't really like bordeaux, \"Look, this has some fruit and isn't too scary.\" And, in doing so, they lose all that I love about it. At the end of a long and liver-decimating lunch, I was once handed a tumbler filled with a violently alcoholic spirit, about the colour of whisky. I couldn't quite place what it was. \"Aged grappa,\" said the man who had brought it. Then he added, with a touch of wistfulness, \"You can always tell it by the smell of vomit.\" Grappa does, indeed, carry the odour of a heavy hangover, the sort that forces stinking, unprocessed alcohol out through your pores in an all-over body burp. Apparently, Italo Calvino thought it appropriate only for \"defrocked priests, unemployed bookkeepers and husbands that have been cuckolded\". Perhaps the kindest thing I've heard said about it - and this must be the extremeness of the alcohol level - is that it smells like skin-toner. But for all of that, it's a bloody good digestif, searing down your oesophagus and almost through the stomach lining. The Italian equivalent of marc, grappa is distilled from the solid residues (grape skins, pulp, stems and seeds) left over from wine-making which would otherwise be used for compost, so it is, quite literally, a waste product. But now what was once the simplest of drinks has become another chic product, with varietal and aged grappas aimed at strong coffee-drinking would-be ponces, though I note another breed of connoisseurs has sprung up to decry those who drink overly floral and fruity \"boutique grappas\". There are plenty of these. In Florence recently, I tried grappas made from Brunello remnants, and a couple of SuperTuscans (a great way of squeezing extra profits out of already top-priced wine). We didn't much like the Brunello. The tasting notes given from around a table of wine writers ranged from \"rough\" to \"really not very nice\" to \"completely gross\". The Tignanello was better: robust, softer, and fruitier. The Ornellaia was the most vinous and grapey, much more gentle, with a sweet aromatic smell you might compare to hay if you were feeling poetic. Tasting a line-up of grappas is not easy, on account of the strength, so you can tip a few drops on to your hands, rub them vigorously together, as if applying eau de Tramp, until the alcohol has evaporated, then you sniff, like a dog at a lamppost, at the flavour-bearing molecules that remain. Could I be more tempting? You might try out the hand routine (cooked apples? Tea?) with Nardini Riserva Grappa (\u00a312.99 for 35cl, new into Sainsbury's). It's a pale yellow colour because it has been aged in wood, and reaches a pretty hard-core 50% abv. If you want to be authentically Italian, have some for breakfast, or pour a splash into your espresso to make a caffe corretto - that's a \"corrected coffee\", literally translated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
