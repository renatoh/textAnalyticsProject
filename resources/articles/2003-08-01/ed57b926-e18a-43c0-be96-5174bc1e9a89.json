Perhaps you imagine a coldish, Canadian existence. Warmish summers, with long, white winters. Almost picturesque, really. Half-a-dozen degrees Celsius is not a lot, after all. Sadly, it is an image wide of the mark. The last time Earth was six degrees colder, it was gripped by an ice age. Glaciers covered large parts of the globe and species shivered their way to extinction. In short, six degrees is a great deal. We should keep the number in mind when considering the sweltering heat now afflicting Britain. Few experts now doubt such weather is the result of carbon dioxide and other industrial gases building up in the atmosphere, a rise that has sent global temperatures up by about a half a degree since 1950. Spread unevenly across the planet, we are currently experiencing this apparent tiny rise in terms of melted motorways, buckling railway tracks and overstretched air-conditioning units. Understanding the climate can be tricky, it would seem. But that is just today. By 2050, temperatures will rise a further two degrees - even if we halt all industrial gas emissions overnight. Carbon dioxide lingers so long in the atmosphere that it will take decades to instigate planetary cooling. And that assumes mankind acts decisively. Not very likely, when you think about it. In fact, the most probable outcome is one of total inaction. With America, responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, refusing to make any cutbacks and Russia, another major offender, being equally intransigent, the prospects of any international deal for limiting global warming look remote. And given that India and China are now transforming themselves into industrial nations that will pump even more gas into the atmosphere, most experts gloomily predict temperatures rising unabated until 2100, when the world will be warmer by six degrees than it is today, an increase with almost unguessable consequences. Our species is conducting an experiment with an unknown outcome, one that threatens not just ourselves but all creatures and plants on the planet. Mankind is facing a self-made crisis that is as potentially devastating as nuclear war. The fact we have so far survived that threat is the only light on the horizon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
