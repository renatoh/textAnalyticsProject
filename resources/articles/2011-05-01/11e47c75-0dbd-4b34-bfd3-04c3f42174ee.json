The former champion \u2013 whose legal name was Randy Poffo \u2013 was known for his husky voice, gaudy costumes and \"oooh, yeah!\" catch phrase. Once a minor league baseball player, Savage rose to fame as Macho Man in the 1980s in the World Wrestling Federation, now known as the WWE. He was considered a charismatic and athletic performer in the choreographed world of professional wrestling and he held numerous championships. Under contract with the World Wrestling Federation from 1985 to 1993, he competed against fellow stars including Hulk Hogan, Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat and Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts. His entrance music was Pomp and Circumstance and his signature accessories were sunglasses, bandannas and colourful cowboy hats. His father Angelo Poffo and brother \"Leaping\" Lanny Poffo also wrestled professionally. He was \"an iconic figure,\" said hall of fame professional wrestler Dusty \"The American Dream\" Rhodes. The wrestler's jeep collided with a tree after it crossed the carriageway near to his home in Seminole, Florida, US police said. Savage died of his injuries at a nearby hospital. His wife, a passenger in the vehicle, was treated for minor injuries. Media quoted his brother as saying the retired showman had suffered a heart attack at the wheel, though police in Florida would not comment until a postmortem had been performed. The crash was not alcohol-related, authorities said. A statement on the WWE website read: \"WWE is saddened to learn of the passing of one of the greatest Superstars of his time. Our sincerest condolences go out to his family and friends.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
