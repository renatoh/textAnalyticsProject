But a growing body of research now suggests that their outreach efforts may not count for much: for many voters, it seems, a candidate's facial features matter more than their policy platform and campaign slogans. Alexander Todorov, a psychologist at Princeton University, found that when given photographs of rival candidates in obscure local election races - and absolutely no other information - people correctly guessed the eventual winner about 70% of the time. Todorov says his findings suggest that people unconsciously associate certain facial features with competence, and cast their vote accordingly. \"You can't help but make these judgments,\" he says. \"Our conscious life is guided by automatic processes - we may feel like we're in control, but it's not really the case.\" It's not clear exactly how the process works, but early signs are that people tend to make a snap judgment, viewing baby-faced politicians as inherently less competent than rivals with more mature features. A good example: Tony Blair has a prototypically competent face, while the Tories' ill-fated former frontman William Hague - famously branded \"a foetus\" by Tony Banks - is much more baby-faced. So who's got the physiognomic advantage in the 2008 election cycle? To find out, American and Australian researchers last year asked Australian university students and New Zealand schoolgirls - who it was hoped would have had little previous exposure to US politics - to rate photographs of potential Democratic and Republican presidential candidates on a \"competence scale\" of one to 10. The results, due to be published shortly, are intriguing: of the Republican candidates, the students judged John McCain (average rating: 6.2) to be slightly more competent than Mitt Romney (6.1), but well ahead of Rudy Giuliani (5.7), Fred Thompson (5.4) and Mike Huckabee (5.3). In the Democratic camp, Hillary Clinton (7.2) edged out Barack Obama (6.8), while John Edwards (6.5) trailed in third place. The study's lead author, University of Pennsylvania marketing professor Scott Armstrong, says the students' ratings map closely onto the results of the Super Tuesday primary vote, suggesting that facial competence may predict election results better than opinion polls. Even prediction markets like the Iowa Electronic Markets, which purport to harness the \"wisdom of crowds\" to predict election outcomes, can't rival the predictive power of Armstrong's schoolgirls: \"If you'd bet on the Super Tuesday results based solely on facial competency you'd have won a lot of money on these markets,\" says Armstrong. But while outward appearances can reportedly help predict elections, they aren't necessarily the best criteria for picking presidents. In his book Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell argues that Ohio Republican Warren Harding swept to victory in the 1920 presidential election largely on the strength of his rumbling baritone and \"presidential\" demeanour. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. Harding's scandal-besieged administration went down as one of the worst of all time, with the beleaguered president himself admitting: \"I am not fit for this office and never should have been here.\" Gladwell tells me he's not surprised to hear that voters are still judging politicians by their looks. Political races are essentially popularity contests, he says, and people are generally excellent at making snap judgments about traits like attractiveness, friendliness and likeability. Unfortunately, we can't make similarly rapid assessments of intelligence or integrity. \"That's why candidates who pass the 'blink' test win,\" he says. \"It's also why candidates who pass the blink test aren't necessarily particularly honest or conscientious.\" That may help explain why George Bush - another strong contender for the Worst President Ever gong - is still in the White House. In 2004, researchers found that while people favoured John Kerry's \"intelligent and forgiving\" face when asked to pick a peacetime president, Bush's \"masculine and dominant\" features came across best in times of war. \"There's no relationship between how competent people look and how competent they are,\" says Armstrong. \"It's a little bit distressing that looks count for so much.\" Still, there's one bit of good news for Democrats: according to the new research, both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have much more competent features than baby-faced septuagenarian John McCain. Does that mean that whoever wins the Democratic nomination, the outcome of the November presidential election is a foregone conclusion? \"I wouldn't bet my own money on it,\" admits Todorov. \"But it'd certainly be nice if the prediction was confirmed.\" For more blogs on the US elections, click here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
