Though DiCaprio, 41, has starred in some of the biggest Hollywood movies of the past two decades, including Titanic, Catch Me if You Can, The Departed, and The Wolf of Wall Street, there\u2019s a growing belief in the industry that it\u2019s the A-lister\u2019s fifth Oscar nomination for The Revenant that\u2019s going to win him the coveted prize at the 88th Academy Awards on Sunday. DiCaprio is the biggest favourite in Oscar betting history, with odds of 1/100. A spokesman from William Hill said: \u201cAt 1/66, Helen Mirren (The Queen) was the shortest priced Oscar contender in betting history \u2013 Leonardo DiCaprio has now taken the honour and it looks like we will now have a king.\u201d The Revenant, a seven-month shoot in sub-zero temperatures, leads the Oscar contenders with 12 nominations across the categories, including best picture and best director. DiCaprio has already won a Golden Globe for his depiction of Hugh Glass, a 19th-century fur trapper who vows revenge on the man who killed his son and left him for dead. The harrowing feature sees DiCaprio being mauled by a bear, trekking through miles of snow-covered mountains, tumbling down a waterfall and even sleeping inside the carcass of a disembowelled horse. \u201cI think his performance has to be seen by hopefully millions of people, [and] I\u2019m sure they will be emotionally involved and happy about seeing Leo in this calibre,\u201d the film\u2019s director, Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, has said. DiCaprio received his first Oscar nod in 1994 for his supporting role as a disabled teenager in What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape. Though his subsequent roles in Romeo + Juliet, The Beach and Titanic propelled him into the spotlight and turned him into an international heartthrob, it was another 11 years until the actor received a second nomination, this time for his performance in The Aviator. After that, more nominations followed: in 2007 for Blood Diamond and in 2014 for The Wolf of Wall Street, but again, DiCaprio failed to take home the trophy, sparking countless memes and gifs that made light of his near-misses. A new video game called Leo\u2019s Red Carpet Rampage by animation collective The Line allows players to help DiCaprio \u201cwin the award this time\u201d by racing his 2016 rivals, Matt Damon (The Martian), Michael Fassbender (Steve Jobs), Eddie Redmayne (The Danish Girl) and Bryan Cranston (Trumbo), across a red carpet. Jane Crowther, editor of Total Film, said DiCaprio has everything in his favour this year. \u201cThe Oscars don\u2019t necessarily award people based purely on performance \u2013 they award people based on the narrative that goes along the road to the ceremony,\u201d she said. \u201cThe narrative for Leonardo is he\u2019s a great actor, he\u2019s been in a lot of great films, and never won in the past. The other narrative of this particular film is that this guy suffered for his art, he got cold, he really ate a bison liver when he\u2019s a vegetarian, he was so true to the project. It\u2019s that sort of story that Oscar voters like. \u201cAlso, he\u2019s played the game this year. He\u2019s turned out to everything. He\u2019s usually not that interested in doing very much promotion, he\u2019s not a red-carpet guy, but he\u2019s put himself about. The Academy respond to somebody who shows they really admire and appreciate the status the award brings. Even though everybody says it\u2019s such an honour to be nominated, they like the fact that somebody wants it. Is the performance in The Revenant the best out of the group? Not necessarily. But everyone will agree Leonardo has earned an Oscar for his body of work.\u201d Dan Jolin, features editor of Empire magazine, said: \u201cEvery Oscar year, you tend to get people for whom there\u2019s an overwhelming sense of it really, finally being their time. DiCaprio now seems to have matured to that point: this is his fourth nomination as leading man, and fifth as actor. \u201cThere is also the value of the performance in The Revenant itself, which has a real \u2018suffering for your art\u2019 quality to it that tends to land well with the Academy in the acting categories, be that actors who put themselves through extreme physical transformations or, as in this case, throw themselves into extreme physical situations.\u201d \u201cPeople have grown up with Leonardo, they feel like they know him and they\u2019re invested in him,\u201d Crowther said. \u201cThey want to see someone who deserves it being recognised at the highest level. He\u2019s due.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
