The book has been legally printed and widely sold there for some time (Where's Lenin? 17 April, page 20, Review). \u2022 When a financial piece referred to Portugal as \"Europe's poorest nation\", what it meant to say was western Europe's poorest (Markets plummet on fears of Greek contagion, 28 April, page 33). \u2022\u2008A piece looking at the role of politicians' spouses remarked that wider social advancement of women \"has not prevented a schizophrenic attitude\" in Britain towards wives of prominent figures. The Guardian style book says the term schizophrenic should be used in a medical context only \u2013 \"never to mean 'in two minds', contradictory, or erratic, which is wrong, as well as offensive to people diagnosed with this illness\" (Spouses of Parliament, 28 April, page 10, G2). \u2022\u2008An obituary stated that Lord Raglan was sacked as president of the Bath Society in 1977 after a personality clash. In fact, he was a founding member of the society in 1977 and served as its chairman for more than three decades (19 April, page 33). \u2022\u2008Due to an editing error, a review of the Mercedes E250 listed this estate's CO2 emissions at 53g/km instead of 153g/km (On the road: Cottage in the country, here we come, 24 April, page 75, Weekend)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
