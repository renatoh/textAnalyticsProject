That\u2019s how the transfer has worked out, surprisingly since Benteke is Liverpool\u2019s second biggest signing and the most expensive player at the club. Even when Brendan Rodgers bought him there was some confusion over the role he might play in a quick-breaking, passing side, and since J\u00fcrgen Klopp took over there seems to be still more. Not even the almost permanent absence of Daniel Sturridge has encouraged Klopp to use Benteke in meaningful matches and the suspicion the striker still needs to convince his new manager of his usefulness led to pointed questions at the most recent press conference and reassurances from Klopp that the player still has a future at Anfield. That being so, the future started here. Benteke may have privately felt he was on a hiding to nothing playing in an unfamiliar side against League Two opponents \u2013 normally the trial match comes before the multi-million pound transfer \u2013 but to begin at the beginning Benteke\u2019s name drew warm applause from the home crowd when it was announced before kick-off. Possibly because it was one of the very few supporters recognised, though in fairness it is likely to be a badge of honour among Liverpool fans to be thoroughly familiar with all the club\u2019s youth products. Once the game got under way Benteke\u2019s first significant involvement was in attempting to meet a Jo\u00e3o Carlos Teixeira cross right in front of goal. On that occasion he was foiled by the goalkeeper reaching the ball first but a couple of minutes later he was back and this time with a killer pass instead of a bludgeoned finish. Liverpool\u2019s opening goal owed a lot to Brad Smith\u2019s sprightly run down the left but without the return ball that sent the full-back to the goalline the low cross Joe Allen tucked away may not have been so straightforward. Benteke could have doubled the lead midway through the first half from another Teixeira cross, this time one that picked him out more accurately, though with a virtual free header from the six-yard line he put the ball over both goalkeeper and bar. When he skewed his next shot horribly wide the attempt drew derisive jeers from the Exeter fans and it appeared Benteke may be trying too hard, yet at least he kept trying and put a far-post header into the side-netting following a corner. Some attempted close-control trickery that went awry at the Anfield Road end predictably produced chants of \u201cwhat a waste of money\u201d, and when Benteke tried to prove otherwise on Liverpool\u2019s last attack of the first half his low shot was on target but too easily blocked. While the Exeter fans\u2019s verdict might have been harsh, as the second half wore on an uncomfortable truth began to be revealed. Benteke does not really fit in with the way Liverpool\u2019s second string play either. One might have thought a bunch of callow youths would be glad of an expensive striker in their midst, but could they find him? Rarely. Did they play to Benteke\u2019s strengths? Hardly. Constantly making himself available but rarely getting the ball, the Belgian was as peripheral in this Cup side as he has been in the Liverpool first team. When Jordon Ibe set up Sheyi Ojo for his exquisite finish for the second goal, he overlooked Benteke standing right next to him. Odd, isn\u2019t it? Ars\u00e8ne Wenger says the English game is suffering for want of old fashioned centre-forwards, strikers with a physical presence who are good in the air. Aston Villa are definitely suffering without Benteke\u2019s goals, for even playing for a side usually struggling at the wrong end of the table he proved himself effective enough to get noticed. Yet Liverpool have just such a player and they cannot find a way to use him. It is not just one manager\u2019s judgment either, but two. And nor is Benteke the only centre-forward to have this happen to him in recent times. Andy Carroll cost even more. Benteke does not resemble Carroll as a player, though his situation is rapidly becoming identical. Which is to say, untenable. He is a good enough footballer to have a future; whether it is as Anfield becomes less clear every day. Could history be repeating itself? To paraphrase Lady Bracknell, to misplace one astronomically expensive centre-forward could be considered an accident. Two sounds careless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
