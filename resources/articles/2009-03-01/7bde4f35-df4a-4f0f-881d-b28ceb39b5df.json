Thierry Henry grabbed two goals in two minutes midway through the first period to see the 2006 winners on their way and, after his three successful strikes over the two legs, Lyon fans must be heartily sick of their compatriot. Lionel Messi scored Barcelona's third after surging into the Lyon penalty area and exchanging passes with Samuel Eto'o for an exquisite finish before Eto'o added another high-profile name to the score sheet with another fine goal two minutes before the break. Lyon hit back with a goal either side of half-time, playmaker Juninho setting up the first and scoring the second. But Barcelona were not going to let a place in the last eight slip away in front of their home fans and, despite a flurry of Lyon challenges that earned six players yellow cards and Juninho a red, added a fifth from substitute Salif Keita deep into injury time to win 6-3 on aggregate. After Real's capitulation at Anfield on Tuesday, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid travelled to Porto, the 2004 winners, intent on upholding the pride of the Spanish capital. After a 2-2 draw in the first leg the first half was a pedestrian affair with few efforts on goal and Porto were happy to keep the Spanish side at bay for much of the second half to win a last eight place on away goals. Henry, booked in first-half injury time, scored his first after running on to a lofted pass from Rafael M\u00e1rquez in the 25th minute and slotting home under the body of Lyon goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. He repeated the dose two minutes later when, unmarked, he was fed the ball by Xavi Hernandez to score his fourth goal of this season's competition. Henry then turned provider for Eto'o, playing the ball across the area and the Cameroonian striker evaded one challenge before lashing the ball past Lloris. Juninho, Lyon's scorer in the first leg, helped ease Lyon's pain shortly before the interval when his corner was headed in by Jean Makoun. The Brazilian scored the French champions' second three minutes after the break after a dummy by Karim Benzema created the space for Juninho to place a low shot past Victor Vald\u00e9s. Henry was substituted after 75 minutes as coach Josep Guardiola looked towards Sunday's La Liga trip to Almeria. In Porto, Atl\u00e9tico brought on Diego Forl\u00e1n for Maxi Rodr\u00edguez early in the second half in an attempt to sharpen their attacking options but the game failed to catch light despite Porto, who came from behind twice in the first leg, having one of this season's most productive goalscorers in the competition, the Argentinian Lisandro, leading the line. Lisandro had scored a goal in each half in Madrid but, apart from two efforts early in the second half, was kept largely quiet by the Atletico defence. With 13 minutes left, Porto's Hulk hit the Atl\u00e9tico crossbar but the home side was happy just to keep the visitors quiet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
