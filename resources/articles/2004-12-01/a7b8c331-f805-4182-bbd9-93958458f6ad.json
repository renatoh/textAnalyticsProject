Cutting-edge art and the Home Office may seem unhappy bedfellows. But the institution regarded by many as the Big Brother of government departments - in charge of incarceration, spying on subversives and deportations - is about to fill its freshly built offices with \u00a31m of hip, specially commissioned artwork. The Government Art Fund asked artist Liam Gillick, Turner-nominated in 2002, to work with architects Terry Farrell and Partners on the new \u00a3311m offices in Westminster. Due to open in March, they replace Eric Bedford's loathed trio of 1970s slabs, which were long regarded as having all the charm of an eastern bloc secret-police headquarters. Meanwhile, Jeremy Deller, who won the 2004 Turner prize on Monday, has, with fellow artist Alan Kane, selected 77 paintings, drawings and sculptures made by prison inmates to enliven the working conditions of the 3,000-odd Marsham Street staff. Officials will, for instance, be encouraged to reflect on the reality of their penal policies by a wooden sculpture of a ball and chain. Fiona Mactaggart, Home Office parliamentary under secretary, said the prisoners' work \"demonstrates that art is not only embedded in physical structures but can contribute to achieving the key objectives of the Home Office, such as reducing crime and reoffending\". Gillick - whose own art relates closely to architecture and the urban environment, and who was involved in the design of \"every part of the exterior of the building\" - in turn asked a number of young artists (\"not the usual suspects\", as he put it) to produce work for the building and its environs that related to \"both the function and the ethos of the Home Office\". Emma Kay, whose previous work includes a piece in which she attempted to write down the complete works of Shakespeare from memory, will literally be setting in stone opinions of members of the public, etched into the paving of a pedestrian street. When he moves to the new offices the home secretary, David Blunkett, will certainly find himself within a rather different artistic environment than that of his predecessors. Michael Howard, when home secretary, surrounded himself with 19th-century canvases depicting battle scenes, while Jack Straw crept into the 20th century by means of some Charles Rennie Mackintosh furniture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
