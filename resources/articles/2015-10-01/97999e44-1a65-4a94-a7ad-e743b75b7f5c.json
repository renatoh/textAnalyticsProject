Burgess was the Rugby Football League\u2019s guest of honour at the England rugby league team\u2019s game against France in Leigh on Saturday and spent several hours in the company of high-profile RFL officials. He also visited the England changing room afterwards. The RFL would neither confirm nor deny to the Guardian reports that Burgess was in talks to return to the sport on Wednesday , but it is understood he is in discussions about leaving union less than 12 months after his high-profile departure from league. The BBC reported on Wednesday that Burgess had been given time off by Bath to decide upon a potential return to league, with a move back to Australia\u2019s NRL and his former club, South Sydney Rabbitohs, the likely destination. Crucially, any transfer fee payable to Bath would not count on Souths\u2019 salary cap, according to reports in Australia, which was one obstacle feared to be blocking a return. Burgess\u2019s selection for England\u2019s Rugby World Cup squad was criticised, having only made his first union appearance for Bath last November. He did not play international rugby union until August this year, when he featured in England\u2019s warmup game against France. Reports in Australia this week suggested he was on course to return to the Rabbitohs less than a year after leaving Sydney, and with his younger brothers Thomas and George both signing new contracts with the club last week, talk has continued to intensify over a return to league. If Burgess returns to the South Sydney club, owned by the Hollywood actor Russell Crowe, he will play for the side he helped to their first Grand Final triumph in 43 years prior to switching codes. Reports have also suggested that Bath are now in the market for a blindside flanker, which would offer more evidence that Burgess is on his way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
