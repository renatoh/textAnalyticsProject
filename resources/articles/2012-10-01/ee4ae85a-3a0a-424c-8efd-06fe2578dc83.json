There are all the usual premieres, gala screenings, new British films and special events, but they're arranged in a different way. There are now three sections dealing with the awards contenders: Official Competition, including Michael Winterbottom's Everyday, Jacques Audiard's Rust And Bone and Martin McDonagh's Seven Psychopaths; First Feature, including Sundance-winner Beasts Of The Southern Wild and Wadjda, the first movie directed by a Saudi Arabian woman; and Documentary, with subjects including Ginger Baker, Ralph Steadman and Catholic church paedophilia. The broader selection has also been reclassified, according to new themes such as \"Love\", \"Debate\", \"Cult\" and \"Sonic\". That means you might have to do some cross checking to find films by director or country. But there are new titles to be found by Michael Haneke, Michel Gondry, Abbas Kiarostami, Pablo Larra\u00edn, Takashi Miike, Cristian Mungiu and Apichatpong Weerasethakul. There are some 70 British films altogether \u2013 old, new, short and long \u2013 from Great Expectations (the closing gala) to cop family thriller Blood (with Paul Bettany, Mark Strong and Brian Cox), to Ben \"Kill List\" Wheatley's anticipated Sightseers. For celebrity spotters, there's still a red-carpet selection of prestige titles, starting with Tim Burton's Frankenweenie, and taking in the likes of Dustin Hoffman, Marion Cotillard, Viggo Mortensen, Ben Affleck, Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes and the Rolling Stones. Apart from the fact that George Clooney will not be in attendance for the first time in years, having not made any films of late, it should be business as usual. Various venues, Wed to 21 Oct London Greek Film Festival Despite the backdrop of an all-consuming economic crisis and civil unrest, Greek cinema has been on something of a high in recent years, thanks to edgy and bizarre prize-winning films such as Dogtooth (which got an Oscar nomination) and Attenberg. Whether those represent a dawn or a twilight for the country's film-making will be easier to judge after this event, which brings a handful of features, shorts and documentaries. Some of the docs address the current situation, others focus on Greek Olympic heritage. On the fictional side, comedy Fish N' Chips follows a London chippie opening up in Cyprus, while Super Demetrios imagines a parallel world where Thessaloniki has its own superhero. Escapist entertainment on a tight budget: just what the country needs. Westbourne Studios, W6, Mon to 18 Oct Iris Prize Festival, Cardiff In its sixth year, this small but valuable gay and lesbian film festival has a big prize for the winner of its shorts competition: the chance to make a new film, with \u00a325,000 to get started. Which ensures that a worthwhile selection of submissions from around the world will be coming to Wales, with previous prizewinners on hand to share their experiences. Feature films on show include Yossi, Eytan Fox's follow-up to his Israeli hit Yossi &amp; Jagger; US indie Molly's Girl, in which two women announce a fake engagement; and Joshua Tree 1951, a dreamy meditation on closeted Hollywood icon James Dean. Meanwhile, who could resist a title like Codependent Lesbian Space Alien Seeks Same? Cineworld Cardiff &amp; Chapter Arts Centre, Wed to 14 Oct"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
