Ms Hewitt, pointing out that the present system of 35 schemes covering thousands of grants was confusing and poorly targeted, said an initial review should be complete by the summer. The bulk of the aid is given to industries such as steel, shipbuilding and aerospace, but these are under renewed srutiny from Brussels, where the European commission is keen to create a level playing field in the single market. But Ms Hewitt's review at the DTI also covers regional assistance - often used to attract inward investors or modernise large plants - and a host of schemes to promote enterprise and innovation. The new industry secretary told the AEEU engineering union's annual conference in Blackpool that the DTI's role was to help British businesses \"get to the future first\". \"The government cannot protect businesses from changes in technology and the global economy, nor should we try to do so. But the government does have an important role in creating the right environment in which business can prosper and in helping businesses get to the future first,\" she said. Ms Hewitt, who wants the DTI to be the Treasury's equal in driving up the UK's productivity and competitiveness, said the various schemes could be \"better targeted, provide better value for money and less confusion for business\". She coupled this with an appeal to trade unions such as the AEEU to adopt a new role in making sure UK employees adapted to an era when they might take on six or seven jobs in their entire careers. \"There's no such thing as a job for life, but there can be employability for life,\" she said. \"Now is the time for the unions to look forward and redefine their role for the 21st century. Trade unions have a key role in helping their members become more employable, in increasing their opportunities and strengthening their security in a changing world.\" Pointing out that many companies paid for redundant executives to obtain advice, retraining and help in finding a new job, she said that unions should step in and do the same for their members. John Monks, the TUC general secretary, welcomed Ms Hewitt's \"strong recognition of the importance of trade unions in today's uncertain world\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
