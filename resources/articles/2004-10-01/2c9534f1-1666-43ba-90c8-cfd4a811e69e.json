The real \"public scandal\" is that a government minister consistently interfered with an independent scientific committee during its three years of operation. Contrary to Meacher's assertion, the claims by two committee members (endorsed by Meacher) on extreme health effects of radiation inside the body were not \"suppressed\" or \"gagged\". Indeed, they are discussed at length in the report. But the scientific evidence roundly rejects these hypotheses. In addition to their views in the report, the dissenting members had demanded that their \"minority report\" be published by the committee. But none of the experts on the committee was happy to be responsible for publishing incorrect information. Meacher set up this committee and picked its membership. He has used the media to ensure that the public heard far more about a minority view that did not stand up to scientific scrutiny than about the real risks. His extraordinary attacks on the committee seem to stem from the fact that it did not deliver the answer he wanted. The committee can be proud to have produced a thoughtful and balanced report agreed by members ranging from Greenpeace to British Nuclear Fuels. Contrary to Meacher's assumption, the report clearly does have serious implications for policy makers and regulators. Prof Dudley Goodhead Chairman, Cerrie Michael Meacher's article is yet another salvo fired over the heads of the people this group represents in the Bradwell area. In common with others living near nuclear power station sites, we have long felt anxiety about the possible effects of low-level discharges, in our case, from the nuclear power plant in the Blackwater estuary. We were therefore pleased that Meacher set up a national body to look into this issue, especially as data from Bradwell was to be used in the hope of furthering knowledge. Now we find ourselves in the middle of a controversy. As bystanders, we are concerned that the anger generated may deflect from what all parties have concluded, that there is uncertainty regarding the effects of low doses. This is surely a great advance. The next step must be to set up another body to progress the work further.
