This latter stone-built hamlet stands beside the now reluctant river Manifold that's little more than a rill as it saunters beneath the bridge at Brund Mill. Hogweed blooms tall and bold in the dank lanesides that create such a complex network in this broad, green trench sandwiched between the limestone plateau to the east and the tawny upthrust of gritstone moors westward. Down here the other morning, as I made my way towards the far green slopes of trees surrounding Warslow, the newly shorn flock was resting in that same deep shadow, this time the shade of hawthorn hedge, not hedgerow trees. How thankful these hefty ewes must be on sunlit mornings like this to be rid of their encumbering woollens. The dearth of rain this last month and more has brought one bonus. The usual jumping, striding and weaving on the climb to Hayes Gate Lane, across the dank rush-beds, has been reduced to easy, dryshod progress through the brittle vegetation of common rush and soft rush. These lovers of the wet places that are such an aggressive opponent of good, productive hill pasture are taking a good battering as the soil moisture reduces each day. But once the summer rains return they will soon be back on course to ruin productivity of these grasslands. Pressing onward and upward I came in time to the flight of stone steps that allows access to the Longnor road and passed the rear of Warslow Hall, silent now in the strong sunlight of this summer morning. The quaint pair of ponds were quiet, too. The resident moorhens and mallards seem to have taken temporary summer leave but will surely soon return."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
