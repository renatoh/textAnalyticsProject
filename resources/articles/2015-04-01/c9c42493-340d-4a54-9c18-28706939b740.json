The movie\u2019s German title is Die Andere Heimat (that is, The Other Homeland) and it\u2019s subtitled Chronik Einer Sehnsucht \u2014 the English version translates this last word as \u201cvision\u201d though \u201clonging\u201d is more accurate and apposite. Reitz films in a beautiful, crystalline monochrome with incidental details picked out in colour, which often has the effect of flattening the perspective of each shot and making it close to a hyperreal engraving. It is nearly four hours, but never dull for a moment; indeed, there is a boxset addictiveness to the whole thing. Jakob (played by Jan Dieter Schneider, looking weirdly like a Germanic Zach Braff) is a dreamer, a Romantic, a reader, always getting yelled at by his blacksmith dad for idling. He has conceived a passionate desire to leave the grind and oppression and emigrate to the promised land of Brazil \u2014 a \u201chomeland\u201d that is an alternative both to Germany and the church\u2019s feebly promised heaven. Perhaps, like the Godfather movies, the Heimat series will be re-edited in narrative sequence, and this will confer a greater, or a different meaning to the events in this movie. At present, it is superlatively well performed and well directed with a real narrative grip."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
