She had clearly never seen Chekhov's play before. Every word for her was freshly minted, each narrative twist and turn a surprise. Fortunately, Andrew Hilton's revival is so good, it was fresh and surprising for me, too. But I can't help feeling a little envious of that woman. There is something wonderful about encountering a great play for the first time: seeing King Lear with no expectation of the blinding; watching Three Sisters without knowing whether they all get to Moscow; sitting through All My Sons with no foreknowledge of the maggot at the heart of the family. For critics, that only happens with a new play; if we haven't seen a classic, we are likely to have done our homework and read it. I was at the Octagon in Bolton the week before, seeing Ghosts. The play hadn't been staged there for 40 years; indeed, the most recent Ibsen production had been 20 years ago. So, as the marketing manager told me, the majority of the audience would be coming to it for the first time. But it was the second production of Ibsen's tragedy I'd seen in three months (for some curious reason, plays often come along like buses). In the course of my life and career, I've probably seen it more than a dozen times. But that's nothing. There are some plays I've seen over and over. I once saw A Midsummer Night's Dream seven times in a single month. Was it a dreadful chore? No, not at all. It was like having the same meal several times over, but each time cooked by a different chef, some more skilled and inventive than others. With a great play, familiarity shouldn't breed contempt. It should make the experience richer and deeper instead. Still, I'm often aware that I'm coming at a play from a vastly different position to the average audience member. All those productions you have seen over the years juggle around in your head. They can stop you experiencing a play in the moment \u2013 from feeling as if it had been written only that morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
