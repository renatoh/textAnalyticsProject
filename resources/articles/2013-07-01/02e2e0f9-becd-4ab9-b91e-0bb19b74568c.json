Pietersen, with his South African accent and dead-skunk haircut, would not have thought much of the connection but Bastille Day seemed a suitably revolutionary date to begin a tumultuous Test career. His fiery temperament and blistering ability were celebrated loudly by those who knew him best and now, with his fifth Ashes starting next Wednesday, those same characteristics remain as divisive and emphatic as ever. Pietersen's passionate supporters may have anticipated the fact that he has since scored 22 centuries in 94 Tests, at an average of 49.01. Yet not even his detractors could have predicted that, last summer, he would be suspended by his own team for sending inflammatory texts about England's captain, Andrew Strauss, to the opposition in the middle of a Test match \u2013 against South Africa. The subsequent reintegration of Pietersen into England's squad has supposedly been seamless. It even coincided with an impressive 2-1 series win in India, as Pietersen scored an unforgettable century and two 50s, but his long absence through injury removed him from public scrutiny for much of this year. He returned two weeks ago and in his comeback innings, against Yorkshire, rattled off a sumptuous 177 not out for Surrey whose assistant coach, Stuart Barnes, said: \"He is clearly a genius.\" That usually overblown word is accepted by Mick Newell who was entranced by Pietersen's ability, and often appalled by his behaviour, before any other coach in England. Newell has coached Nottinghamshire since June 2002, when he replaced Pietersen's mentor, Clive Rice. Pietersen was furious and, as Newell recalls wryly, \"the first thing I did was to drop him. It probably wasn't my greatest move \u2013 but he was only out the team 10 days and he came back and batted brilliantly.\" Pietersen is scathing of Newell in his autobiography and reminds us that he reeled off four successive centuries in a pointed response. Newell is more gracious and, having twice steered Notts to the championship since Pietersen stomped away from Trent Bridge after two-and-a-half fractious seasons under him, he is balanced in his assessment of a wonderful talent and an emotional man. And so his warning of another likely fallout between Pietersen and England cannot be simply dismissed. \"He's England's best player,\" Newell says, \"but I think it's a short-term fix and it'll blow up again. In terms of getting ready for the Ashes, England handled the texting saga pretty well. But somewhere down the line it will go wrong again. If England beat Australia they'll be OK and they'll get through the [return] Ashes in the winter. But in a year, I'm afraid, you can see it all kicking off again.\" As always with Pietersen it's easy to find a contrary view. Eric Simons, a former coach of South Africa who now counts Pietersen as the star of his Delhi Daredevils team in the IPL, believes the 33-year-old is misunderstood. \"Reputation always precedes someone like KP,\" Simons suggests. \"I first met him in 2009 when we were at the Royal Challengers [the IPL outfit which Pietersen then captained]. I liked his honesty but people sometimes misunderstand that truthfulness. I found him refreshing and infectious. \"We all do crazy things and one of the most interesting conversations we had was when I asked him what had happened to his blue hair. His reply was quite short: 'I grew up.' This time round, in Delhi, I had another interesting conversation about being England captain and whether he could relate to players who were battling \u2013 having empathy for someone else. He said he'd learnt so much since losing the captaincy that he recognised he probably wasn't ready then. He talks honestly about certain bowlers he now wishes he had spoken to differently. So his emotional intelligence grew and his honesty comes through. He's the kind of guy that, if you're overweight and you ask his opinion, he'll tell you: 'Yes, you're overweight!'\" During last summer's texting debacle Pietersen showed emotional incontinence rather than intelligence. It was the worst in a long list of inexplicable stunts and spats. This week, in a thoughtful interview with Andrew Flintoff, Pietersen touched on a possible reason for such tangled behaviour. \"I'm an introvert,\" the usually brash Pietersen told Flintoff, while also conceding that he had been \"scared coming into the dressing room\" when he first played for England. He did not probe that flash of self-knowledge much further \u2013 but it hinted at a notion that Pietersen could be an uneasy introvert working hard to appear cheerfully extrovert. It also echoed the truth, often voiced by his team-mates, that Pietersen can be twitchily insecure without a bat in his hand. His move from South Africa to England, at the age of 19, was difficult and lonely and he tried to offset his vulnerabilities by being loud and flashy. The best way, however, of bolstering his fragile confidence was by performing boldly on the cricket field. \"You had to big him up all the time even though he was the best player I've seen in this country,\" Newell remembers. \"You still had to tell him that because you often didn't know who he was doing it for \u2013 was it for the team or himself? To get the best out of him I kept telling him how good he was and how great he could be. You did play up to him but you knew he was an enormous talent and if he played well your team could do amazing things.\" As England discovered, and may do so again, the temptation to offer a gifted player more latitude inevitably undermines team harmony. \"I didn't manage it so well in 2003,\" Newell concedes. \"You always give your best players a bit more slack \u2013 especially if they have character differences or weaknesses. They might be late for training or lackadaisical but because they're your best players you need them. \"There were times that year where it was probably pushed too far by Kevin and we would react in an aggressive way and over-disciplined him. The relationship wasn't great but, to be fair to him, he scored the most runs and topped the averages every season he was with us.\" On the field, especially while batting, all the complexities melt away. He has always played cricket with brutal, yet winning, simplicity. Jonathan Trott, who followed the same path from South Africa to England in a much more composed way, sums up Pietersen's cricketing philosophy with amusement. \"Kev's different,\" Trott says with one of his rare grins. \"The other guys want to know if the ball's swinging or how the wicket's playing. With Kev it's just 'See Ball, Hit Ball'. Very basic. He lets his natural instincts and co-ordination take over.\" An equally blunt \"See Ball, Hit Ball\" approach to real life inevitably causes trouble; but Trott believes that Pietersen has matured in the wake of his recent buffetings. \"I think Kev's getting older and wiser in the way he conducts himself.\" Do the old Pietersen insecurities still remain? \"Possibly,\" Trott murmurs. \"Everyone has their own way of going about life and Kevin's a guy who likes being in the public eye. Some people don't. Each to their own.\" Trott also spells out the obvious reason why England allowed Pietersen to return to the fold after the nadir of Textgate. \"We're still a very good team without Kevin. But with Kev we become a much better and more dangerous team. The opposition would rather he wasn't playing for us \u2013 and I'd much rather have him in my team.\" Pietersen has been determined in overcoming the knee injury which kept him out of cricket for 100 days this year \u2013 and his hard work has been highlighted by Surrey's coaches. \"He does the tough stuff very well,\" Barnes said. His often forgotten willingness to grind away in training and rehab could yet result in him achieving his newly-stated goal of scoring 10,000 Test runs. Pietersen, so far, has racked up 7,499 runs. That personal ambition might help him harness his moodily impulsive streak \u2013 but Simons argues that Pietersen has already proved himself in the dressing room. \"I've always felt that if I've gone to Kevin and asked him to do something in a certain way for the sake of the team, and if it made sense and it wasn't about controlling or changing him, it would be fine. In short, I think he has been harshly judged without people understanding him. I admire KP because he doesn't let it faze him. Of course he'd like you to like him and see him for who he is. But he's not going to bow and scrape to be popular.\" Paul Collingwood is, in most respects, the antithesis of a maverick like KP. A consummate and selfless team man, Collingwood played most of his 68 Tests alongside Pietersen. Now, when asked about a unique cricketer, he speaks of his awe when first batting with Pietersen. \"I only played the last Test of the 2005 Ashes at The Oval and it was difficult because the intensity was at another level. And that's how it felt when I was batting with KP. It was incredible. I stood at the other end thinking: 'How the hang are you doing this under such pressure?' I wouldn't even think about some of the stuff he was trying. It's almost as if the more pressure he is under the more risks Kevin will take. \"I remember this spell when I went in just before lunch and Brett Lee was steaming in and bowling really fast. During the lunch break KP said: 'I'm going to have a swing now.' It was amazing viewing it in such close-up. Lee was bowling at 95mph and KP was hitting him into the stands. After a lot of short stuff there was a length ball and he just swatted it back past the stumps. I remember standing at the other end thinking: 'I can't believe what I'm seeing.' It was his theatre \u2013 and I had the best seat in the house. Pietersen rarely wastes words while batting. \"He doesn't like to talk about unnecessary stuff \u2013 he just smashes it,\" Trott says. And when he misses one of his shots of pure bravado, Collingwood believes his batting partner should always accentuate the positive. \"I'd say: 'Wow, KP, you were just inches away from really getting hold of that one!' I think anyone in world sport who has a genius streak needs to be boosted. It's not a negative because they enjoy that adulation. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses and a team can't be made up of 11 of me\u2026 or 11 KPs. To get the team dynamics right you need an array of different characters. KP will win you games you shouldn't be winning. People like myself will save you games you shouldn't be saving. You need that blend of personalities.\" Yet how does a loyal team man like Collingwood square Pietersen ruining dressing-room unity last year? \"Over the past four years England have become such a closeknit team. When Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss took over, England blossomed. Players were willing to develop their skills and practise hard \u2013 they really bought into it. So there are limits as to how far you can allow these geniuses to upset the applecart. That's what they do \u2013 but you also have to understand what they give you in match situations. People say it wasn't handled right. Actually, it was managed very well in my eyes. KP was told that's not good enough and you're going to miss games because you've overstepped the mark. That's your punishment. Now he's back again and his 177 not out in his first game was typical KP. He destroys people.\" Collingwood pauses when asked if Pietersen is England's key player \u2013 and he eventually chooses Alastair Cook instead. \"If they don't get Cookie out it's a long haul for the Aussies. You know what kind of rhythm he can get into in \u2013 and if Joe Root and Trott do the same you're going to see KP coming in against tired bowlers. It's going to be great viewing if you're an England supporter.\" It's striking that Newell should compare Pietersen to another \"destroyer\" in Chris Gayle. \"They seem similar as people who've divided their team and suffered bans for a while. In terms of ego and publicity-seeking they have something in common. There's no doubt Kevin has an enormous ego which feeds off his cricket. Gayle and Pietersen are two of the world's top five batsmen but they both cause friction in their teams because of their desire to be different.\" Only a few days before the first Ashes Test at Trent Bridge it seems ironic that Pietersen should return to his old home ground where he revolted against Newell and Notts with the same spiky discord he showed later against Strauss and England. Newell has been snubbed and derided by Pietersen but he does not hesitate when asked a simple question. If he was England's coach would he have also ensured Pietersen's reintegration before the Ashes? \"Yes,\" Newell says emphatically. \"Of course. The big stage definitely suits KP. Whatever else happens in the months ahead I expect him to have a huge Ashes.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
