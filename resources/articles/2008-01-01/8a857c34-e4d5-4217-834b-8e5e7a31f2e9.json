Rik Ferguson of internet security solutions company Trend Micro thinks so. He's thinking of the behaviour of online billing software from Leeds-based Micro Bill Systems Ltd. Install it to view a three-day free trial of pornographic videos and, if you don't cancel in time, you'll see a popup bill window appear for increasingly longer periods each day until you pay \u00a339.99. \"It's saying, 'I am going to disable your system unless you pay the money, do you agree to this?' That's really consented blackmail,\" says Ferguson, who hates the idea of X-rated websites shaming users into paying up. Micro Bill Systems (MBS) continues to hold this newspaper's interest. Last year (My PC is being held to ransom, March 1), we were alerted about MBS by Ted Kenyon. Two months later (Legal wrangles over porn billing software, May 31), we reported on further developments. And we've regularly heard about your problems since. Described in the company's 4,000-word terms and conditions, popup billing demanding money often catches people unawares. Now, security experts at Trend and McAfee Avert Labs have decided to speak out, despite the risk of legal retaliation from the company. 'Intrusive and disturbing' \"Having had several reports of people feeling victimised by the software, we decided not to let any of our customers be affected by it,\" Ferguson says. \"They'll see a notification window informing them that what they're downloading is a trojan and disallowing them from downloading it.\" Toralv Dirro of McAfee Avert Labs says: \"This is very intrusive and very disturbing software that prevents you from working with your computer.\" A blog post by another McAfee Avert Labs researcher (tinyurl.com/34zjta) last November drew a parallel with car clamping. In a test by this newspaper, 31 out of 32 anti-virus programs on Virustotal.com detected the MBS billing software from sexxxpassport.com. Symantec labels this as a \"potentially unwanted app\" while McAfee brands it a \"potentially unwanted program\". McAfee and Trend enable the software to be removed, as does Prevx 2.0 and the Brute Force Uninstaller. Since last August, angry users finding their PCs unexpectedly disrupted (some thanks to their partner's covert porn-viewing activities) have turned to a new forum - mbsvictims.org.uk - for mutual help. It's run by professional blogger Andy Merrett and Liz, whose husband confessed when his company laptop became unusable (Legal wrangles over porn billing software, May 31, 2007). Even young children have installed the software. \"It's great to see the some of the big boys squaring up to MBS,\" Liz says. \" I'd like to say how puzzled I've been by the unwillingness of AV [antivirus] providers to tackle MBS head-on.\" Liz also doesn't understand the attitude of West Yorkshire Trading Standards, which has had almost 600 inquiries about MBS since November 2006. \"How is it that West Yorkshire Trading Standards still apparently maintain that the activity of this company is legitimate?\" she says. \"If they are operating within the law, then I'd expect pressure to be put on the Office of Fair Trading to tighten up the law. In the US, for example, a very similar operation was the subject of legal action to provide more protection for the consumer.\" She is referring to the US Federal Trade Commission's settlement with Movieland, the collective name for several companies, along with Andrew Garroni and Easton Herd, which used disruptive popup software to demand payment. The FTC required the defendants to provide a way for consumers to remove the software, barred future downloads without consumers' consent and asked for more than $500,000 (\u00a3256,000) for consumer redress (tinyurl.com/25ax2x). Although MBS managing director Ashley Bateup admits to having met Andrew Garroni, he denies having any business dealings with him. Discussions did, however, take place between Bateup's co-director, Mark Webb, and Andrew Garroni three years ago. Tests carried out for this newspaper show that the billing software used by Movieland and MBS is not the same. What chance, though, of legal action here against MBS? David Lodge, of West Yorkshire Trading Standards, says that not all 600 inquiries received are \"substantiated complaints\" and meetings with MBS have resulted in changes to terms and conditions. \"It is our opinion at this time that the company is operating within the bounds of existing legislation and as such it would be difficult to take any formal legal action against them,\" Lodge says. For Bateup, media scrutiny has put him under great pressure. He believes that comments made by Trend and McAfee Avert Labs are inaccurate and \"could be deemed defamatory\". Several companies, including Symantec, McAfee and AVG, have been contacted by MBS about interference with lawful commercial practice. MBS's solicitors also sent me a warning letter last year about information on my blog, michaelpollitt.com. More recently, Bateup spent time with Symantec trying to obtain a \"100% clean bill of health\" for MBS billing software. \"We will litigate any AV/software removal tool companies or any other company that defames our software as malware,\" Bateup says. Users, he explains, have no right to remove the billing software under their contracts. \"We do however, recognise some elements of our business model have caused some concern to consumers.\" After consultations with Trading Standards and the Office of Fair Trading, Bateup says MBS will introduce changes to its software in April. This will include age verification, links to child protection software and a revised signup process. Bateup also says MBS is about to be consolidated into a \"large, international technology/media company\" which provides a wide range of digital media content. \"MBS will cease to trade as an independent billing company in the second quarter of 2008,\" he says. Going mainstream That company, Bateup adds, hopes to develop a significant international market share by delivering content using pre-pay and post-pay billing models. It will cover video-on-demand for film labels and some TV programmes. \"In addition, a novel music streaming service from a library of millions of tracks in excess of those held on iTunes will be available to consumers,\" Bateup says. There will also be a \"late night\" section. For those who consider themselves victims, the prospect of disruptive popup billing going mainstream won't be welcome. However, Bateup wants to \"positively change the way\" in which his software is adopted. But unless he remains vigilant about what's being downloaded and agreed to, and by who, the wider use of such controversial methods may cause even more upset."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
