Born into poverty in a north German village, his imagination fired by the fables and legends told him by his father, he declared at the age of seven that one day he would find the site of ancient Troy. He never wavered in this intention. He amassed a fortune while still in his 30s, retired from business and went on to dig at Hissarlik and to discover not only the fabled city of Hector and Paris, but the priceless hoard of jewellery and gold that had lain hidden there for thousands of years - Priam's treasure, as he called it. It is Peter Ackroyd's remarkable achievement, in this complex and fascinating novel, to take a figure who was already a legend in his own lifetime, and recreate him as a creature of myth; indeed, an epic hero, able to shape truth to his vision, to call on the powers of the gods still residing among the ruins of the city. His Heinrich Obermann - a name for a demigod - has one unswerving goal: all his being is concentrated on demonstrating to the world, in the teeth of general opinion to the contrary, that Homer's account of the Trojan war is a true relation of events and that the Trojan warriors were Europeans, not Asians, and of noble race. This quest - to establish the truth of what has been thought of as fable - is the central element in an intricate pattern that runs through the novel, managed by Ackroyd with great skill: a pattern of ambiguities, where opposed concepts cross their borderlines and interweave, truth merging with invention, fable with fact, the rational with the visionary. Obermann is dangerous in his passionate convictions, perhaps even capable of murder. Those who doubt or contradict him come to grief, but it is not clear by whose agency. Gods or men or accident, the trickery of Odysseus or the wrath of Zeus? The sceptical Harvard professor who has dared to doubt him is stricken and dies; the competitor in the race sprains an ankle and loses against all the odds. But if this is the doing of the gods, do they intervene to protect truth or to maintain falsehood? This tension of questioning, of doubts never quite resolved, makes The Fall of Troy a compelling read, with a narrative force that never slackens. Just when he needs to prove that Troy was inhabited by a race of warriors, Obermann produces a bronze sword - but has he found it on the site or brought it from elsewhere? How did the deadly brown adder find its way on to his rival's bed? Two modes of uncovering the past function side by side here: the work of excavation, of unearthing palace and temple and tomb, and, no less dramatic, the gradual disclosure of Obermann's past and the tissue of deception that surrounds it. In a novel that engages with the supernatural, the natural must be well established, and Ackroyd succeeds brilliantly in giving us the physical realities of archaeological excavation: the mud, the rubble, the apparent disorder, the ant-like work of carrying away soil, the vital clues in the lie of the land. There has always been a strong sense of place in his work, and here the descriptions of the landscape, imbued with myth as it is, carry total conviction - the windy plain, the sacred river, Mount Ida and the grove where Paris made the fatal gift. The archaeologist himself, the presiding genius of the place, is someone whom, if we knew him in life, we would avoid like the plague. He is monstrous in his self-vaunting, he cannot brook the slightest dissent, he is intolerably overbearing. In the world of the novel he is no less a monster, but he is redeemed by his energy and vision; we feel for him when the fabric of his life is torn apart. True to the style of the Homeric hero, he is strong in declamation, weak in introspection. In fact - and this is in marked contrast to the treatment accorded to the other characters in the novel, even the minor ones - we are never told what passes through his mind, what his thoughts and feelings are. Towards the end of the novel, he strikes his son for admitting to shame. But shame existed in the heroic world of Homer, shame at falling short, shame at being dishonoured. For Obermann there is only the force of desire and the desolation of defeat. Perhaps it is this more than anything else that marks him off from the culture he so much admires. The Fall of Troy is provoking, unsettling, ingenious - and a delight to read. \u00b7 Barry Unsworth's latest novel is The Ruby in Her Navel (Hamish Hamilton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
