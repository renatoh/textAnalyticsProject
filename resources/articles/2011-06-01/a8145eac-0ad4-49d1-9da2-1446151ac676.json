In fact it was the weather that changed history. Kitchener, secretary of state for war, was a passenger on HMS Hampshire, which was sailing north into the teeth of a north-east gale. The armoured cruiser took a course to the lee of the islands of Orkney to try to avoid the worst weather. This proved to be a fatal mistake because the channel had not been cleared by minesweepers. By the time the Hampshire was within sight of the Brough of Birsay in Orkney the wind had shifted to the north-west and was blowing force 9. It was then that the cruiser hit a mine. The ship sank in minutes and only 12 crew survived. Among the 643 dead were Kitchener and the officials he had taken with him to stiffen the resolve of Tsar Nicholas, and get him to redouble his efforts to aid the allies in their war against Germany. Survivors said the old general met his death bravely, as befitted the victor of the Battle of Omdurman against the Dervishes, and other British imperial campaigns. The popular image of Kitchener remaining is that poster portrait with the drooping moustache and the slogan \"Your country needs YOU.\" The influence his mission might have had on the tsar's policy, the course of the war and revolution, was destroyed by that unseasonable gale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
