The 21-year-old Englishman, who fired a solid 69, then took issue with his former Walker Cup team-mate Gary Wolstenholme, the Amateur champion who in a recent interview described Dougherty's swing as \"one of the best I've ever seen as an amateur. \"But,\" he added, \"you don't see Justin Rose going out to a disco every night and trying to knock off every girl he sees. They call Nick 'Mojo' because girls are absolutely attracted to him . . . I don't see a lot of dedication to be world No1, which is what he says he wants.\" Dougherty, who claims he regularly sleeps 16 hours a day since contracting glandular fever, insists he respects Wolstenholme, but he commented: \"I'm not sure 'womaniser' is the right word to describe an 18 or 19-year-old - it's a long time since I was like that and I've changed a lot. \"My girlfriend, Vicky, was upset about it and I dropped Gary a note asking why he was putting in his two penn'orth. He said he was misquoted. I don't care what people think about me. If it isn't true, it doesn't bother me.\" This land of stunning blondes is custom made for party animals, but Dougherty has kept his head down and his mind on golf this week. \"After watching Italian Job 2003 I hit the sack at 11 and was up at 5.30am for my 7.50 tee-time,\" he said. \"Hopefully I'll get my 16 hours' sleep in tonight as I'll be off last.\" He also praised his guru Nick Faldo, who believes Dougherty has the talent to be a major winner, for helping him through \"depressing times\" which have seen him miss six halfway cuts in eight Tour starts. \"Nick stressed you have to go through the lows to appreciate the highs - it's the nature of the beast. He's stricter than Tiger Woods about diet. I love burgers and drink three or four pints of Coke a day, but that's all had to go. \"Gary Evans is another good friend and he called me to say, 'Don't think about the numbers - just concentrate on one shot at a time. I spent a week with my dad before making my first cut last week, and he helped with my swing, too, and made sure I was in bed on time.\" He leads by three from his former Walker Cup team-mate Luke Donald (68), the former Ryder Cup captain Mark James (70) and the Dutchman Maarten Lafeber (71)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
