Ever since 6 August 1945, debate about whether the atomic bomb was an absolute necessity in ending the war in the Pacific has never ceased. What is indisputable, however, is that, ever since 1945, nuclear weapons have transformed the global strategic landscape and even the very notion of war. The goal of eliminating such weapons is entirely laudable. But the world has changed in so many ways in 70 years that is it equally important to be clear-eyed about what can and should reasonably be done. There are more than 15,000 nuclear weapons in the world today. The vast majority are still held by the US and Russia. Many had hoped that the end of the cold war would spell the obsolescence of nuclear weapons. Yet powers large and small have continued to see such weapons as a lifesaver for national security and as a key tool in managing rivalries and influence. Meanwhile, the danger of proliferation has heightened further because of access to the technology and the emergence of non-state threats. International agreements, like the treaty aiming to end fissile material production, or to ban nuclear tests, have met with only limited success. When Barack Obama in 2009 called for global efforts to achieve \u201ca world without nuclear weapons\u201d to be relaunched, he was careful to add that he might not see this in his lifetime. Since then, China has continued to increase its stock of nuclear-armed missiles, North Korea has launched rockets that could be armed, while in 2014 Russia became the first signatory of the non-proliferation treaty to openly brandish the threat of nuclear weapon use as a warning in Ukraine. The paradox is that, although nuclear weapons seem to belong to another era, much of what goes on in international relations today shows their continued centrality. Most strategists now doubt whether any state would carry out a massive nuclear strike of the sort that kept cold war leaders awake at night. But the new anxiety is that an adversary could use a nuclear weapon in a regional conflict to offset conventional military inferiority. This sort of nuclear thinking has been behind Russia\u2019s unprecedented nuclear sabre-rattling in Ukraine, and can be discerned in China\u2019s behaviour in the Pacific region. No one can know how the Iranian situation will unfold either, despite the recent deal in Geneva, nor how other Middle East countries will react. Taken together, it looks as though the \u201czero nuke\u201d world that the abolition movement has been calling for may be receding, not getting closer. It is certainly the reason why nuclear disarmament has slipped down the international agenda since the US-Russia agreement of 2010. There is no more a global consensus in favour of the elimination of nuclear weapons today than there is a consensus in favour of banning war itself. Nuclear weapons are the antithesis of some of the most basic humanitarian values. The horrific legacy of Hiroshima must never be forgotten. But the horror unleashed by massive carpet- or barrel-bombing is no more humanitarian in any meaningful sense. The reality is that nuclear weapons remain at the core of an approach to deterrence that has not gone away: this sets them apart from other weapons. To call on western nuclear states to disarm unilaterally, when there is so much renewed global strategic uncertainty, therefore risks being an exercise in denial, however impeccable the intentions may be and however attractive the slogans. The nuclear-free world is a vision that can and must be pursued through tireless diplomatic effort and campaigns. But on this day of all days it would be foolish, and maybe even dangerous, to imagine that the disarmament of a few would lead to all others suddenly and for ever giving up on their atomic weapons, or on the intention of building one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
