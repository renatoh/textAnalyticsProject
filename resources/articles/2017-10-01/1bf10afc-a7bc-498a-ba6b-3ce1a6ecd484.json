Kyrgios has struggled all season with shoulder, hip and knee issues and was sent crashing out the European Open in Belgium on Wednesday by veteran left-hander Ruben Bemelmans. He has failed to advance past the second round in any of the four grand slams and believes a long break will allow him to recapture his best form on home soil this summer. \u201cUnfortunately, due to the recurrence of my hip injury that I originally suffered at Queen\u2019s, I am shutting down my season to make sure I can rehab and prepare as best as I can for the Australian summer,\u201d Kyrgios posted in a statement on Twitter. \u201cThis year hasn\u2019t been as successful as I would have liked, especially at the slams, although it has been positive in some other areas. I will do all I can to improve for 2018.\u201d Czech Tomas Berdych, the world No18, also announced that he would miss tournaments in Vienna and Paris because of a back injury. The 32-year-old still had a remote chance of qualifying for the season-ending ATP World Tour finals for an eighth time. Other top players who will not play again in 2017 include 12-times grand slam champion Novak Djokovic, three-times major winner Stan Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori and Milos Raonic. World No3 Andy Murray has not played since Wimbledon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
