The US president will be in Italy in late May for a meeting of the G7 industrialised democracies. An audience with the pontiff would bring together two wildly contrasting world views. \u201cI look very much forward to meeting the pope,\u201d said on Thursday in a joint press conference at the White House with the Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni. Minutes later Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, admitted that the meeting has not yet been confirmed. Trump\u2019s assertion now risks making a non-meeting look like a snub. Trump and the pope fell out in February last year after the Republican candidate had pledged to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. The head of the Catholic church said: \u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.\u201d Trump responded that he was \u201cproud to be a Christian\u201d and described the pope\u2019s comments as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. If the Vatican were attacked by Islamic State, he added, the pontiff would have prayed Trump was president to prevent it. Pope Francis called for greater compassion for refugees less than a week after Trump tried to impose a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Last month the Vatican also urged Trump to listen to \u201cdissenting voices\u201d and reconsider his position on climate change. On Thursday Trump was positive about the prospect of visiting Sicily and acknowledged Italy\u2019s artistic and scientific achievements. \u201cFrom Venice to Florence, from Verdi to Pavarotti \u2013 a friend of mine, great friend of mine,\u201d he ad-libbed. The widow of Luciano Pavarotti, who died a decade ago, objected to Trump\u2019s use of the operatic tenor\u2019s version of Nessun Dorma at campaign rallies, writing: \u201cThe values of brotherhood and solidarity that Luciano Pavarotti upheld throughout his artistic career are incompatible with the world vision of the candidate Donald Trump.\u201d Trump also said a strong Europe was \u201cvery, very important\u201d to the US, condemned Iran for doing \u201ca tremendous disservice\u201d to the nuclear agreement and expressed confidence that China was working hard to rein in North Korea. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether or not they\u2019re able to do that, but I have absolute confidence that he will be trying very, very hard,\u201d he said. Contradicting earlier official statements, the president acknowledged that he has conflated diplomacy with trade in talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. \u201cI actually told him, I said, \u2018You\u2019ll make a much better deal on trade if you get rid of this menace or do something about the menace of North Korea.\u2019 Because that\u2019s what it is.\u201d Trump gave a confusing answer on America\u2019s plans for Libya, which sank into chaos after the US-backed overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. \u201cI do not see a role in Libya,\u201d he told reporters in the East Room. \u201cI think the United States has, right now, enough roles. We\u2019re in a role everywhere, so I do not see that. \u201cI do see a role in getting rid of Isis. We\u2019re being very effective in that regard \u2026 We are effectively ridding the world of Isis. I see that as a primary role and that is what we\u2019re going to do, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or Libya or anywhere else. And that role will come to an end at a certain point and we\u2019ll be able to go back and rebuild our country, which is what I want to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
