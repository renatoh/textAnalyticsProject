It\u2019s not my son\u2019s father paying the \u00a37 weekly child maintenance contribution, it\u2019s you. Like me, you have two children so you know about raising babies on a shoestring. You have resolved our ongoing battle (I will share his terms in calling it a battle). It has been horrific and the long-term effects are yet to present themselves. Yet, 15 years too late, you take on this token gesture. It\u2019s an olive branch. A knowing half smile from you to me. Almost the cost of a school bus ticket. Almost the cost of a week\u2019s sandwiches. Nearly the cost of a haircut. Where is his dad in all this? Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m pleased he\u2019s gone away, metaphorically speaking. There are no more locks to double-check at night and I can switch on my phone without a churning pit of dread. Remember when my son and I phoned you after he was in trouble with the police? I thought it right to inform his dad; to seek his counsel and insight as a role model. And to avoid being reprimanded for not informing him of my latest failing. You were so real on the phone while you were holding the fort for your own family. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he is,\u201d you said. \u201cI can\u2019t get hold of him. I don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be home. He\u2019s abroad somewhere.\u201d That was our last attempt to communicate with him. It reminded me of being a teenager in the same boat, seeking my dad\u2019s help. In tears, I eventually got hold of my uncle, who said he was away, working, he presumed. I didn\u2019t try again. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to ask for help. It\u2019s that we want to avoid the hurt of disappointment. I\u2019m sorry this payment has fallen on you. I know my ex doesn\u2019t have a bank account, which he says isn\u2019t his fault \u2013 just like losing his driving licence or another family home were not his fault. So thank you for the standing order and giving your stepson what you can afford. They say he should pay \u00a310, but the \u00a37 is great. If nothing else, seeing your name on my bank statement reassures me of the power of motherhood, the honour, the sacrifice. Ultimately the love for our families is greater than any battle won or lost. \u2022 We will pay \u00a325 for every letter we publish.
