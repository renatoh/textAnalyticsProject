Lizards decamped so fast from their basking spots that it was nearly impossible to see just what they were. I was picking my way cautiously in the hope of seeing an adder but even so the tremors from my footsteps were like earthquakes to these sensitive reptiles. The heathland butterflies are weather-worn but their season is not yet over. A pair of common blues flitted flirtatiously for several minutes before settling on the tip of a bracken leaf to consummate their relationship. Red common darter dragonflies ranged out from the ponds across heather in search of a meal. Their ability to snatch flies and small insects out of the air is amazing. Last year at this time in another part of the forest it was the silence of the heaths that caught the attention. Not so this year. The hum of bees, the stridulation of grasshoppers, and the fizzing of dragonfly wings, all suggested that these heaths are alive and well. The mauve of massed ling is almost overpowering. It stretched down both sides of the valley, broken from time to time by the yellow specks of the late flowering gorse whose stature scarcely lifts it above its neighbours. Towards the bottom, a small patch of white bell heather caught my eye and stayed in mind as I walked back along the woodland edge. After a while, I thought I saw some white ling. Closer inspection showed that it was an orchid, an autumn lady's-tresses, one of many tucked in among the heather and the bracken. These orchids are only 10cms tall. Their small flowers with green mouths spiral around lime-green stems that are covered with fine down. As I knelt to get a picture, I almost put my nose into a rarity that I simply had not noticed when standing so close by. It was a gentian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
