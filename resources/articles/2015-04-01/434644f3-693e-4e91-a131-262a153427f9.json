Ruth Bader Ginsburg has long been a liberal champion \u2013 dubbed \u2018Notorious RBG\u2019 by her younger fans \u2013 for her withering dissent from the court\u2019s increasingly conservative consensus. But while her preference for supporting equal rights in this case was never in doubt, what was striking on Tuesday was how her willingness to place it along the civil rights continuum allowed her to cut through the argument in a way even the court\u2019s conservative firebrands struggled to do. \u201cMarriage today is not what it was under the common law tradition, under the civil law tradition,\u201d said Ginsburg when Justices Roberts and Kennedy began to fret about whether the court had a right to challenge centuries of tradition. \u201cMarriage was a relationship of a dominant male to a subordinate female,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat ended as a result of this court\u2019s decision in 1982 when Louisiana\u2019s Head and Master Rule was struck down \u2026 Would that be a choice that state should [still] be allowed to have? To cling to marriage the way it once was?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied John Bursch, the somewhat chastised lawyer for the states who are seeking to preserve their ban on gay marriage. Bursch was similarly eviscerated by Ginsburg when he tried to argue that the sole purpose of marriage was to ensure a stable relationship for procreation. \u201cSuppose a couple, 70-year-old couple, comes in and they want to get married?\u201d remarked the 82-year-old Ginsburg, to laughter, after a protracted debate over whether it was fair to ask couples if they wanted children before allowing them to wed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask them any questions. You know they are not going to have any children.\u201d Conversely she came to the rescue of a lawyer for the petitioners when he floundered on the question of whether states that ban gay marriage should have to recognise weddings carried out in other states. Would they be allowed to refuse recognition in other cases? Such as where another state allowed the marriages of children after puberty, Justice Alito wanted to know. \u201cI think, the presumption would be in such a state that someone age 13 can\u2019t consent,\u201d interjected Ginsburg helpfully. In the end, her bottom line \u2013 rejecting the notion that extending marriage rights would somehow weaken the institution \u2013 was persuasive enough that even chief justice Roberts appeared sympathetic. \u201cAll of the incentives, all of the benefits that marriage affords would still be available,\u201d said Ginsburg. \u201cSo you\u2019re not taking away anything from heterosexual couples. They would have the very same incentive to marry, all the benefits that come with marriage that they do now.\u201d If this had been a civil injury case, it might have been thrown out right then. Instead, campaigners for marriage equality will have to wait until June to see if Ginsburg\u2019s colleagues see it that way too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
