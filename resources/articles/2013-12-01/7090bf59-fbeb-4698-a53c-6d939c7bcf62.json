Liverpool's managing director, Ian Ayre, met Su\u00e1rez's agent Pere Guardiola in Barcelona earlier this week to instigate talks over a new deal for the Uruguay international, who has two and a half years remaining on his contract. Rodgers refused to provide an update on the negotiations. \"There is nothing to report. Anything contractual with players is private,\" he said. But the Liverpool manager did express a belief the Premier League's leading goalscorer will prolong an Anfield career he wanted to end in search of Champions League football only four months ago. \"I've got every confidence that will be the case,\" said Rodgers. \"I speak to all the players and I think they're happy here. Luis and I talk about the present. We speak about the improvements in his game and how he can become better in the future. I don't think there's any doubt he feels he's progressed here as a player. \"No matter how good you are and whether you're 26 or 32, like Steven Gerrard was when I came in here, if you want to become a better player and feel you are improving and see the club progressing, then you are happy. And at this moment in time I don't think he can be any happier. I think he is at the happiest point he has been.\" Su\u00e1rez has scored a remarkable 17 goals in 11 league matches since returning from suspension on 25 September and was named captain for Liverpool's 5-0 destruction of Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Rodgers insisted he had no reservations about giving such a role to a player with a chequered history. He added: \"We all make mistakes but I would hate to think that you would be punished for a lifetime for it. This is a guy that has made a mistake but has shown he is a learner. I know him well enough and think he is a great player, a good man and in Steven's absence and with Daniel Agger out of the team I could not think of anyone better [for the captaincy].\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
