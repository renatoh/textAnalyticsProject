Like many other young couples in their fogbound neighbourhood, the Cooks served their country in the recent war; Holland was a soldier in the Pacific theatre, while Pearlie - along with \"only a few other girls from a community like mine\" - left their small southern hometown to do auxiliary work for the navy. Yet the postwar world doesn't seem filled with promise to them. Relations with their neighbours are oddly guarded. People stare at them in restaurants, and when Pearlie has lunch with Holland's elderly twin cousins, they eat \"in a special area of a department-store lunchroom, after being turned away by two others\". One day, a golden-haired stranger shows up and politely removes his hat. \"I wasn't,\" Pearlie writes, \"very used to men like him removing their hats in my presence.\" Unspoken prohibitions are also at work in their household. Holland, a dark, strikingly attractive man whose job at a fittings company often keeps him away from home, needs a calming environment. Husband and wife sleep in separate bedrooms. Their telephone has a muted ring, and Pearlie has even managed to find them a dog that doesn't bark. She has arranged all this because, before their marriage, which took place when they were reunited by chance after the war, Holland's cousins warned her that he suffers from \"bad blood, a crooked heart\". There isn't, it seems, a cure for this condition. \"Don't let him out of your sight,\" the cousins added: he shouldn't need \"to go downtown, or worry over the past\". At this point, one of them got worked up and shouted: \"Don't do it! Don't marry him!\" But Pearlie decided that \"I hadn't heard right ... it was so absurd, so crazed\". Into this set-up comes the golden-haired stranger, who introduces himself to Pearlie as Buzz, a friend of Holland's from the war years. And almost immediately, Greer fills in some of the yawning blanks that give his opening section the artificial, slightly tinny resonance of a narrative laying the groundwork for a series of twists. Pearlie is a reader of Ford Madox Ford. Will Holland turn out to be a compulsive adulterer along the lines of Edward Ashburnham in The Good Soldier? Not quite. Buzz reveals to Pearlie that he's Holland's former lover. The two of them met in hospital during the war. Holland left him when Pearlie reappeared on the scene, but now Buzz wants him back. If Pearlie will agree to step aside, Buzz will give her his considerable fortune. She says she'll think it over: in those days, she writes, there were limited options \"for coloured girls like me\". This moment of putative revelation - Pearlie's first direct acknowledgment that the Cooks are African-American - fits neatly into the novel's general scheme. Again and again, as the ensuing story plays out, Greer toys with the reader's presumed preconceptions as his characters make reliably mistaken surmises about one another. One of the preconceptions that's central to his theme is the idea that the American 1950s were sunnily innocent years, an idea with great purchase on the conservative imagination. For Pearlie, the pressing facts about 1953 are the Korean war, the pre-civil rights racial dispensation, the fears of nuclear war, the execution of the Rosenbergs and the persecution of homosexuals. Against this backdrop, her interest in silences, misunderstandings and people's many-sidedness acquires a historical dimension: for her and the other characters, many things can't be openly said. Pearlie has a taste for aphoristic musings. \"We think we know the ones we love,\" she writes. \"But what we love turns out to be a poor translation, a translation we ourselves have made, from a language we barely know.\" These quasi-Proustian observations and their associated metaphors are brought to a state of high polish. But Greer's plotting doesn't always live up to Pearlie's commentary. A side-story involving a spirited white girl who's secretly engaged to a prejudiced soda-jerk is tacked on to the main plot in a way that's both implausible and underexplained. Pearlie's sympathy for Buzz blooms remarkably quickly, and there's an excess of busily symbolic detail. If the characters watch a movie, overhear a TV show or read the words printed on a paper bag, what they come across will be eerily reflective of their predicament. Most of all, Greer's first big narrative bombshell doesn't detonate with the force that he seems to be hoping for. After all the wary looks from white neighbours, references to the status of the \"coloured\" population, mentions of Pearlie's \"community\" and descriptions of visits to segregated lunchrooms, only very inattentive readers will be startled to learn that the Cooks are black; some might even wonder why Pearlie has tried to play such a heavy-handed trick. The surprises in what follows are managed more skilfully, and Greer has clearly done his homework on the time he's depicting. But the artificial, slightly tinny resonance never goes away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
