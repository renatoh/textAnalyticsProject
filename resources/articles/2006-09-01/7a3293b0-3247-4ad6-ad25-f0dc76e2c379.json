They rode their luck early on against Manchester City but were worthy winners of a bitty if compelling contest, and the sporadically swaggering manner of this victory suggested they have far too much class to be sucked into a relegation battle. The same might not be true of City, for whom this was a bad night. They had lost their composure and their dignity long before the end: Micah Richards had an almighty schoolboy tantrum when he was substituted and then Ousmane Dabo was sent off, perhaps harshly, for landing a flailing arm in the face of Steve Sidwell. It confirmed the increasing sense that City - after Ben Thatcher's horrible tackle on Pedro Mendes - have replaced Blackburn Rovers as the Premiership's bovver boys. The problem is that the end, ten defeats in the last 11 away games, is nowhere near to justifying the means. City still have not scored from open play this season, yet for much of the first half they were the dominant side, forcing Reading to play on their own rugged terms. Joey Barton dominated Sidwell and James Harper in the Reading midfield, but those in front of him fail to ram home City's dominance. \"You have to take your chances,\" said their manager Stuart Pearce. \"Every time we had a chance it seemed to go down the goalkeeper's throat. The first team to score was always going to win the game.\" That goal came against the run of play in the 23rd minute, when Ivar Ingimarsson escaped Sylvain Distin to thump a header into the corner from Bobby Convey's arcing free-kick. Reading were insatiable on either side of half-time. Sidwell was denied by a wonderful fingertip save from the outstanding Nicky Weaver and Seol Ki-hyeon wastefully planted a free header over the bar. City's burgeoning frustration manifested itself in the regular use of excessive force after the break, most notably when Trevor Sinclair cleaned out Convey from behind with a spiteful challenge which might have produced a red card. Then Richards inexplicably lost it after being replaced by Hatem Trabelsi, ripping off his shirt in fury. \"It's my job to educate him: how to behave, how to conduct himself,\" said Pearce. \"He's got some great role models in Paul Dickov, Claudio Reyna. It's not a big problem. I wasn't sure about the sending off, but I haven't seen it again. If the referee deems it a sending off, we go with that. TV seem to think it was harsh, the player seems to think it was very harsh.\" Steve Coppell, the Reading manager, was more concerned with his own side's attempt to stockpile enough points to secure safety and refused to get carried away by a second home win. \"It's a big night for us,\" Coppell said. \"We'll take points any way we can get them: home, away, through financial scandals, whatever. As new boys we are going to get ProZoned to death - once teams get a handle on you, the test really starts. It's a constant, constant challenge.\" On this evidence, they look well equipped to handle it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
