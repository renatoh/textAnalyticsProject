OK, thrashed is a bit strong. Let's settle for thoroughly outplayed. United taught Juventus a lesson three months ago in the Champions League, defeating the Italians home and away. Real's 6-5 aggregate victory over United in the quarters did not reflect the gap in class between the two sides. Nor did Juventus's 4-3 success in the semi-finals do justice to the manner in which Edgar Davids and Pavel Nedved muscled the men in white off the park in Turin. All of which is of little help, in the week of the Champions League final, to anyone purporting to pronounce with authority on the state of European club football. To add to the confusion, consider this: rumours have been rife in the past few days that Juve's Marcello Lippi will take over from Vicente del Bosque as coach of Real Madrid. Anyone who suggested such a thing on the night of 25 February, after Sir Alex Ferguson's team had beaten Lippi's 3-0 at the Stadio delle Alpi, would have been carried away by the men in white coats. Six weeks later, after Real's symphonic annihilation of Manchester United at the Bernab\u00e9u, it would have been inconceivable to imagine that Del Bosque's job would soon be seen to be hanging by a thread. Are there any really worthwhile conclusions that we can draw from the European season now coming to a close? Not a lot, apart from the obvious fact that the European Cup has shown itself once again to be the best football competition there is - several notches in quality above last year's World Cup. The Italians have bounced back after five years in the doldrums and no one would quarrel with Lippi's observation that, while Italian football might not be the prettiest to watch, it has demonstrated that it is worthy of respect. But it is too early to say whether this means that Serie A is once again the dominant force in European football. The two Milan teams squeaked through to the semi-finals while Juventus had to leave it to an extra-time breakaway to knock out Barcelona. If Juventus win on Wednesday, Ferguson may be tempted to do an Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and ask whether the winners are the best team in the competition. If Milan win, similar questions may be asked in Madrid, Real having soundly beaten the Italians two months ago. Equally, it is too early to say that the Germans cease to be a force. Bayern Munich's lame exit from the first stage was almost as surprising as France's and Argentina's in the World Cup, but now that they have gone on to win the Bundesliga once more, no team from the seemingly stronger Italian, Spanish or English leagues will fancy being drawn against them next season. As for Bayer Leverkusen, here is further evidence of football's eternal inscrutability. Admittedly they lost the excellent Michael Ballack and Ze Roberto to Bayern last summer, but to go from Champions League runners-up last season to avoiding relegation by the skin of their teeth 12 months later is beyond rational explanation. More remarkable even than Bayer Leverkusen's decline during these past nine months has been the success of Real Sociedad. If the small team from San Sebastian - imagine, in England, Southampton - win their four remaining games they win the Spanish championship. The fact that they are definitely in next season's Champions League is staggering. Having spent the three past seasons battling against relegation, having cut their budget by 25 per cent last summer, there they are poised to snatch the championship from the most glamorous, most expensively assembled team of all. If it happens, one of football's most depressing great certainties - that you can't succeed unless you have pots of money - will have bitten the dust. And what of Real Madrid, who might end the season empty-handed? We can say in their favour the one thing we all knew at the beginning of the season: that at their best they play the most scintillating football anywhere. Whatever happens this season, or the next, or the one after that, everyone who watched those two quarter-finals against Manchester United will never forget the performances of Ra\u00fal, Ronaldo and Zidane. The lesson learnt by the team Gary Neville described as the Harlem Globetrotters is that winning is more than a question of raw talent. They were unlucky to lose Ra\u00fal, Ronaldo and Claude Makelele against Juventus, but they forgot the basics, such as the necessity to defend. It is amazing that Real have no back-up for the relentless Makelele; that they have only one defensive midfielder - one midfielder capable of tackling - in their entire squad. In the two away games they lost in Europe this season, at Milan and Juventus, Makelele was missing. Since Italian teams are never short of hard, all-action midfielders, in each case Real were overrun. In Turin in particular they were majestically overrun. In Edgar Davids, as well as in Thuram and Montero, Juventus had the steel that Real have neglected to factor sufficiently into their calculations. In Nedved they had a player who looked as if he might, with a good final under his belt, win this year's European player of the year award. What a shame that because of a rash, pointless and far from malicious tackle on McManaman, the Czech is suspended on Wednesday. Lippi says that if Juve win they will dedicate the victory to Nedved, the player who did more than anyone to get them to Old Trafford. Clearly, on both Italian and European form, they are the better team. Given the perverse way the preceding big games in the Champions League have gone, though, you'd be better off putting your money on Milan.
