The hole exists in all implementations of TCP that comply with the Internet Engineering Task Force's TCP specification. By exploiting the holes, malicious hackers could cause TCP sessions to end prematurely, creating a 'denial of service', or DoS attack, reports IDG News Service. \"Despite the dire warnings, the impact of the TCP hole will probably be small.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
