The whereabouts requirements in Wada's code, whereby athletes must provide a 24/7 log so drug testers can track them down, were declared illegal last month by European Union data-protection experts. The Canada-based agency pressed ahead, claiming the experts had made \"regrettable factual errors and questionable assertions of law\". But after a meeting last week with the Council of Europe \u2013 the continent's highest authority on human rights \u2013 Wada's spin doctors released an announcement admitting it would now implement an \"enhanced version\" of the privacy standard governing whereabouts information. Sources involved in the top-level dialogue say the development came after Wada was left in no doubt that the funding it receives from governments was at risk if it continued to fight existing data-protection laws. The gunboat diplomacy presented a challenge to Wada's very existence, since it depends on government money. \"Anti-doping organisations based in Europe must respect their national data-protection laws [which] prevail over the standard,\" said Wada's president, John Fahey. However, athletes are still in the dark about what the new \"enhanced version\" will contain, since Wada published only the fact of its climbdown and not the content of the new standard. King's bad timing Ledley King's arrest on Sunday on suspicion of racially aggravated assault could not have come at a worse time for football's anti-racism movement. King is one of only four non\u2011white club captains in the Premier League and as such is a powerful ambassador for Kick It Out. But King's appearance on the front page of newspapers yesterday, having allegedly used a hugely insulting term against an Asian doorman, coincided with Kick It Out's Asians in Football Forum at the City of Manchester Stadium last night. The Tottenham player has said: \"I'm looking forward to playing my part in making a difference with Kick It Out.\" Although a charge like this is hardly what the organisation had in mind. Olympics at a priceThe Olympics on pay-per-view looks like becoming a reality after the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, left, indicated his organisation is ready to shake up TV contracts after London 2012. Rogge wants to reduce free-to-air programming to 200 hours from each games for the big European TV markets and the IOC is inviting broadcasters to tender for the 2014 and 2016 Olympics. But that contravenes UK legislation, which demands all Olympics coverage be shown on terrestrial TV. No doubt the IOC's director of marketing, Timo Lumme, will attempt to bend the ears of David Davies's television-listings review panel, which is examining the status of \"crown jewel\" events, when he visits it in the coming weeks. Don't mention the coupFifa has long had a bee in its bonnet about \"outside interference\" in its national associations and its congress in the Bahamas next month will legislate to ban from competitions those which fall under the control of \"politicians, governments, states, media, etc\". Coincidentally, Vitaly Mutko, Russia's football association head and leader of a World Cup bid that is seen as one of England 2018's main contenders, will be attending the same congress as a Fifa executive committee member. Mutko became head of the Russia Football Union after his predecessor, Viacheslav Koloskov, was deposed in 2005 under the orders of one of Vladimir Putin's deputies in what was an openly political coup. Mutko doubles up as Russia's sports minister, although no one expects Fifa to concern itself with this particular example of interference from \"politicians, governments, states etc\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
