Zanardi, a two-times Cart champion, lost both legs in a high-speed crash at the Lausitzring on Saturday and has since been in a Berlin hospital in a drug-induced coma. Doctors say his condition is no longer life-threatening but still critical and he will stay in intensive care for at least another week. \"Alex's wife Daniela would very much like the show to go on,\" said Mo Nunn, the team owner. \"However, some of the guys on the team are so devastated by what happened that we believe it would be difficult to fully concentrate on the task at hand. And that could pose a safety risk as we compete on another oval track.\" The team, whose sole driver will be Tony Kanaan, said they expected to run a second car in Houston in early October, with a driver yet to be determined."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
