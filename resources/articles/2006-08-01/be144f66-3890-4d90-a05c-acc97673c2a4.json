Video Networks, which has yet to make a profit after more than \u00a3250m of investment, is majority-owned by Chris Larson, a Microsoft founder. The company had been looking to raise more cash to expand its service beyond London and Stevenage, where it has 45,000 customers, but instead looked for a sale with a price tag of \u00a3100m. Tiscali said it would shortly inform the market about the outcome of negotiations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
