And if you have one of those bosses who says things like, \"my door is always open\", or a go-ahead HR department wanting your feedback in other people's appraisals, then you may well find yourself being exceptionally generous. But beware. No one wants Simon Cowell in their office. The truth hurts, and unvarnished judg ments on your colleagues' abilities , such as \"completely useless\", \"lazy\" or \"just plain thick\" - however accurate and richly deserved - will do you no favours in the long term. So, you have to tread carefully, and learn the lingo. The first thing to remember about criticising others is to keep it broad and nonpersonal. Instead of saying that John is always late, or Sandra spends all day on eBay, talk about time management in \"the team\". If you really want to sound statesman-like, you could talk about the office's culture , as in \"a culture of low productivity \". Next, remember that problems, feuds and cock-ups, however blatantly obvious, should under no circumstances be referred to as such. They are \"issues\" or \"challenges\". At the very most, when referring to the kind of hideous blunder you can smell a mile off, you should talk about a \"miscommunication\" or \"oversight\", wearing a pained expression as you do so. At which point you might be asked for your diagnosis of team weaknesses. Resist the temptation to put the boot in - it looks terribly unprofessional. When pressed for the reason behind all these issues, challenges and cultures of miscommunication, your answer should always be the same: capacity. That's right, capacity. Things go wrong in offices because of \"capacity issues\", which means, broadly speaking, that people don't have enough time to do what they're supposed to. Capacity might be the holy grail of office excuses, but interestingly, it's one of those words that loses its power once you shut down your computer and leave. Try blaming your failure to pick up the dry-cleaning or buy someone a birthday card on capacity issues and see where it gets you. It just won't wash. Friends and partners can instinctively tell the difference between when you don't have time and when you just can't be bothered. Bosses, on the other hand, may have their suspicions, but need solid proof. Once they have it, a capacity issue becomes a \"performance challenge\". And this is where things start to get nasty. As a colleague, you should never talk about other people's performances. It raises the stakes, and has a nasty habit of rebounding on you. The last thing you want is for your masterly critique of team dynamics to be met with a response along the lines of: \"If we don't resolve these performance challenges, then retention is going to become an issue across the department.\" Which in plain English means: \"Pull your socks up or you're all fired.\" The thing is, now you've mastered the art of criticising, you can give as good as you get. Does the boss keep you in the dark, then dump a load of work on you with zero notice? Then why not respond: \"There's a culture of communication deficit linked with persistent capacity overstretch.\" Phew! Keep this up and if they do give you the big \"E\", you could always get a job as a management consultant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
