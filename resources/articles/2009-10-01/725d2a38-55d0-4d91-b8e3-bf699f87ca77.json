Some became stars. There was Peaches, potty-mouthed electro-MILF who wrote songs like Fuck The Pain Away, took her band The Herms (yes, short for ''hermaphrodites'') out to upset the mall-goths supporting Nine Inch Nails and paved the way for Lady Gaga's electroclash burlesque. There was singer-songwriter Leslie Feist, whose folksome 1234 snuck into the UK top 10 \u2013 and on to Sesame Street \u2013 with the aid of an iPod advert. But the most maverick of these Canadians somehow skirted the mainstream, although whether success eluded \"Chilly\" Gonzales, or he eluded success, it's not quite clear. The flamboyant creation of Jason Beck, a former major-label alternative rocker who tired of the Canadian music scene, Gonzales matched prodigious talent with a prankster mentality. Calling himself, with typical modesty, \"the greatest entertainer of the year\", Gonzo followed up his 2000 debut Gonzales Uber Alles \u2013 featuring lounge-pop gem Let's Groove Again \u2013 with brilliant ersatz-rap album The Entertainist and the 2001 single Take Me To Broadway, vaudeville hip-hop that saw Gonzo drop the revelation he had \"an extra testicle\". The UK public, not really feeling polymorphous Jewish entertainers rapping about their mutant ballbags, failed to find a place for Gonzo in their affections. Undeterred, he simply moved to Paris and pulled off another metamorphosis. 2004's Solo Piano was instrumental piano in the vein of Erik Satie. The piano, though, became just another tool for Gonzales's feverish ambition. In May this year, he played piano for 27 hours straight, earning himself a place in Guinness World Records. And last month, he challenged Andrew WK, currently touting his own piano album, 55 Cadillac, to a duel of the ivories in New York. Seldom sitting still, Gonzales has also spawned a cult web hit in the shape of Superproducer, an online sitcom in which he plays a music producer given the unenviable job of salvaging the careers of a string of clueless ne'er-do-wells. But Gonzales is not the sort to remain a back-room man for long. In November, he returns to the UK for four ''Piano Talk Shows'' at London's Pigalle with guests including Peaches, the Cocknbullkid and Jarvis Cocker.\"It's extreme entertainment,\" he tells us. \"The complete Gonzales experience, meaning virtuosity, pranks, and musical derring-do.\" So is this the bit where Chilly Gonzales becomes a star? Who knows, but it's worth remembering that when he called himself \"the greatest entertainer of the year\", he didn't specify which year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
