Collaery is among a string of whistleblowers currently facing jail time for revealing wrongdoing by the Australian government. He is currently being prosecuted for his role in exposing an illegal Australian spy operation on an ally, Timor-Leste, during oil negotiations. Collaery, who also represents former Asis spy Witness X, said the two successive raids on the ABC and News Corp are part of a worrying trend towards authoritarianism and pose an extreme threat to press freedom. \u201cGillian Triggs has said Australia is the most oppressive of the western democracies,\u201d Collaery told Guardian Australia. \u201cI agree with her. It\u2019s gotten worse since she said that.\u201d Collaery is so concerned about the situation in Australia that he\u2019s been forced to move abroad to prepare a defence for his criminal case. His voice adds to a growing mass of discontent about the \u201cchilling effect\u201d the raids will have on public interest journalism and whistleblowers. Australia\u2019s peak union body, the ACTU, described the raids as a \u201cdisturbing threat to press freedom\u201d. The Australian Press Council warned of the possible intimidation of journalists from \u201cpursuing legitimate stories in the public interest\u201d, while the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance said they showed a \u201cdisturbing new normal\u201d that sought to intimidate journalists and whistleblowers. \u201cA second day of raids by the Australian federal police sets a disturbing pattern of assaults on Australian press freedom,\u201d the MEAA media section president, Marcus Strom, said. \u201cThis is nothing short of an attack on the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d The timing of the raids has prompted criticism of the government. The first raid at News Corp on Tuesday related to a story published in 2018. The raid on the ABC on Wednesday related to a story from 2017. The ABC and News Corp respectively described the raids as \u201chighly unusual\u201d and \u201coutrageous and heavy handed\u201d. Collaery said the prosecution of black-letter law \u2013 in this case secrecy laws \u2013 must be balanced against higher values. \u201cLaws don\u2019t exist in isolation. They\u2019ve got to be balanced against higher values,\u201d Collaery said. \u201cOne of the highest values, of course, is that the media and publicity is the soul of justice, has been for centuries.\u201d Collaery\u2019s case is currently before the ACT magistrates court where he and former spy, Witness K, face possible jail time. The pair are charged with communicating information about a secret spy operation in Timor-Leste in 2004, where Australia bugged government offices to gain an upper hand during lucrative oil treaty negotiations. A preliminary hearing to decide how to deal with sensitive evidence is set down for August, and the case may later be committed to the ACT supreme court. The pair are facing a two-year maximum jail term for allegedly conspiring to provide information about the Australian Secret Intelligence Service."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
