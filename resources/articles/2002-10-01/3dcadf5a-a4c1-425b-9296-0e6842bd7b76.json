Nice to see converts to the cause. Some of us can remember when Lotus was attacking software houses with \"look and feel\" lawsuits, and Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation and the free software movement, was marching up and down outside the Louts HQ, sorry, Lotus HQ, with placards. What a pity the light didn't dawn 10 to 20 years ago when Lotus was charging huge sums for its proprietary software! Still, it will be nice to see Chandler. Let's hope it is better than Lotus Organizer (which Lotus bought from Threadz, a small British company), Lotus Agenda, which flopped horribly, and Lotus Notes 4.5, which is one of the nastiest bits of client software I have ever had the misfortune to be forced to use."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
