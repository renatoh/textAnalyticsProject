Hoteliers justify this by pointing out that the cost of providing the room - heating, lighting, cleaning etc - is the same regardless of how many people occupy it. The same rule also applies to self-catering accommodation. The upshot is that single travellers often have to pay over the odds for a room, in some cases paying the same price that two people would pay to share. However, some operators are able to use their buying power to negotiate lower single supplements, some hoteliers waive single supplements out of season and there are some that don't charge single supplements at all. The Single Travellers Action Group (Stag) will provide a list of these companies if you write to Church Lane, Sharnbrook, Bedford, MK44 1HR. For example, Solos Holidays (www.solosholidays.co.uk) and Solo Travel Online (www.solotravelonline.co.uk) specialise in single travel and offer a selection of packages where supplements don't apply. On some group tours, there is an option to share a room with another traveller to keep the cost down, although you will have to rely on the tour operator to match you with your room mate. Alternatively, there are now many websites where you can post a request for a travel companion (see page 10). You might also want to consider a more adventurous holiday, such as trekking, where accommodation is more likely to be in tents, mountain refuges or hostels and prices are more likely to be geared towards single bookings. Alternatively, you might be better off booking at the last minute - hotels will sometimes waive supplements in the interest of filling their empty rooms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
