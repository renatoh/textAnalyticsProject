Andr\u00e1s Schiff", "bodyText": "A few years ago, Andr\u00e1s Schiff told an interviewer that he would prefer his audiences not to applaud at all at the end of Bach's Goldberg Variations. Much better, he thought, would be for the performance to be received in \"a wonderful silence\". Well, his Wigmore Hall audience gave the pianist half of what he wanted on Sunday. For what felt like an age, nobody in the hall seemed to breathe as Mr Schiff let his hands rest lightly on the keys at the end of Bach's 75-minute journey - 500 or more people suspended in consensual reflection and silence. Then, as Mr Schiff relaxed and rose from the piano - a brand new Steinway which he himself had selected for the hall - the applause started, diffidently at first, then sustained and stormy. Almost certainly it will have been the same last night, when Mr Schiff gave the Goldbergs again at the same venue, not least because at the end of this second recital, he was presented with the Wigmore Hall medal to mark the 30th anniversary of his London recital debut. Not only does Mr Schiff always play everything from Bach to Janacek with rare integrity; he also talks a good game too (some of his lecture-recitals on the Beethoven sonatas can be heard at blogs.theguardian.com/music/2006/11/schiff_on_beethoven.html). Mr Schiff originally came to notice here when he finished third - behind Dmitri Alexeev and Mitsuko Uchida, no less - at the 1975 Leeds piano competition. But his life-enhancing contribution to British musical life since then has been second to none."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
