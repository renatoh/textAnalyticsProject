The Rugby Football Union is currently conducting a review of the World Cup campaign with the 2011 tournament in mind and will announce its conclusions next month. But it is clear to its officials this week, after informal consultations with England players, coaches and other interested parties, that there is no need for a radical shake-up. With several talented young backs making their mark on the Guinness Premiership, most of whom were nurtured in the England academy when Ashton was in charge of it between 2002 and 2005, the mood is that he needs to be bolstered by a manager, not shown the door. The former Wasps director of rugby and Ireland coach Warren Gatland was linked with England this month when it looked as if the World Cup campaign was going to end prematurely, but the RFU has made no approach to him and is not interested after being told by Wales, who are in the market for a new head coach, that it would cost at least \u00a3350,000 a year to tempt Gatland to leave New Zealand. Andrew is seen by Twickenham as the ideal appointment because he is already Ashton's boss and his job title as director of elite rugby allows him to attend national selection meetings. He adopted a prominent role in the World Cup after the 36-0 defeat to South Africa and it emerged yesterday that before that match some of the players had voiced their concerns about tactics, selection and training methods on a semi-official basis to the RFU. The RFU's management board will next month consider Ashton's report on the campaign when players and other members of the management will have been interviewed. Andrew will put forward his recommendations for the future and he will be asked to consider becoming the England manager, and Graham Rowntree, who impressed in France as the scrummaging coach, may take charge of the forwards with Mike Ford continuing as defence coach. Tweaking is the word being used at HQ, not revolution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
