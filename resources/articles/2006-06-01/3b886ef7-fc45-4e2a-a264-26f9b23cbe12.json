Do these things have a short lifespan? Ann Perrott Jack Schofield replies: Many products based on computer technologies have a short lifespan compared with traditional \"consumer durables\", including hi-fis, TV sets, cameras and so on, which can last for decades. Rapid progress means hi-tech products soon become obsolete, so when they break, they aren't worth repairing. The suppliers can sell you a much more advanced model for a lower price instead. However, the things are not supposed to fail after four months, and if you contact Apple, it will repair or replace your iPod under guarantee. Unfortunately, it will not replace music you might have bought from its iTunes Music Store. Technically, the Sale of Goods Act should protect you if goods are faulty, even after the one-year guarantee runs out. But Apple and other suppliers generally do not support this view and, no doubt coincidentally, this encourages users to buy their extended warranties. MacInTouch has published an excellent survey of iPod reliability at www.macintouch.com/reliability/ipod failures.html. I have seen no evidence that iPods are either more or less reliable than rival models, except for the discontinued 40GB Click Wheel model, which MacInTouch says \"appears to have been a lemon\". Up to XP I'm on Windows 2000 but want to play with the beta of Office 2007, which works on XP. Is it worth upgrading, and why? Ketlan Ossowski JS: Windows 2000 (Windows 5.0) and XP (Windows 5.1) are basically the same operating system, and unless you like XP's more colourful user interface, there are very few reasons to upgrade. XP's advantages include better compatibility with old Windows software and games, plus extras such as Windows Movie Maker, the built-in firewall and Remote Desktop support. The main difference is the considerable rewriting and security-hardening that went into XP SP2 (Service Pack 2). Microsoft didn't do this for Windows 2000, leaving it orphaned from a development point of view. But if you don't have any security problems, it would make financial sense to wait for Vista, or even Vista's SP1. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
