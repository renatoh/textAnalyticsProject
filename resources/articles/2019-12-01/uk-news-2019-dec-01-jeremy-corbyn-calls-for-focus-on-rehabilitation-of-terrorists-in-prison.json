The Labour leader was speaking before a speech in York on Sunday in which he responded to Friday\u2019s terrorist attack at London Bridge by saying that Britain\u2019s repeated military interventions had \u201cexacerbated rather than resolved\u201d the problem of terrorism. Corbyn\u2019s comments came as the Ministry of Justice said it was conducting a review of licence conditions of about 70 terrorists released under licence since 2000. Usman Khan \u2013 who killed two people in the attack, before being shot dead by police \u2013 was previously jailed for an al-Qaida-inspired plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange and was wearing an electronic tag at the time of the incident. He was released from jail on licence in 2018, half way through a 16-year sentence. Asked on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday whether people convicted of terrorism offences should serve their full sentences, the Labour leader said \u201cnot necessarily\u201d. \u201cI think it depends on the circumstances, it depends on the sentence but crucially it depends on what they have done in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there has to be an examination of how our prison services work and crucially what happens to them on release from prison.\u201d He added: \u201cThere has to be an examination of what goes on in the prison because prisons ought to be a place where people are put away because of major, serious offences but also a place where rehabilitation takes place.\u201d Arguments over the blame for Friday\u2019s attack have come to dominate the election campaign, with the prime minister promising a package of hardline changes which also include mandatory minimum 14-year sentences and an end to automatic early release for terrorism and extremism offences. Corbyn was asked about his previous criticism of \u201cshoot to kill\u201d policies. He said the police had no choice but to shoot Khan dead. \u201cThey were stuck with a situation where there was a credible threat of a bomb belt around his body and it\u2019s an awful situation for any police officer, any public servant to be put in,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThere should never be the first alternative to shoot people, but if there is no other alternative then that\u2019s what you do.\u201d Corbyn repeated his belief that British citizens fighting for Isis overseas should be returned as it was the UK\u2019s responsibility to deal with them. \u201cIf you strip away their citizenship, where are they going to go?\u201d he said. The Labour leader argued that \u201cletting them loose\u201d into an ungoverned space such as Libya would cause a greater danger in the long run. \u201cIt is making us safer by preventing the growth of terrorist forces, by preventing the growth of irrational powerful forces and also looking at who\u2019s funding them, looking at who\u2019s making money out of them, looking at who\u2019s supporting them,\u201d he said. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, appearing on the same programme, was asked about comments made by the father of Jack Merritt, one of the victims of Friday\u2019s attack. Writing on Twitter on Saturday, David Merritt said his son would not have wanted his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentencing. \u201cNo one wants to see the politicisation of this,\u201d said Raab, before going on to say that only a Conservative government could keep people safe. \u201cI don\u2019t think after what we\u2019ve seen, both in this election and in the previous election, in the individuals involved, that anyone would think taking the measures necessary to protect the public and putting their interests and their safety at the forefront \u2013 and as the overriding priority \u2013 would be somehow politicisation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the necessary thing to do to keep people safe and it is only this prime minister and the Conservatives who are offering that.\u201d Speaking to an audience at York college later on Sunday, the Labour leader accused the government of putting people at risk through its cuts to the police and youth services and its part-privatisation of the probation services. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep people safe on the cheap,\u201d he said. \u201cReal security doesn\u2019t only come from strong laws and intelligence. It comes also from effective public services that have the funding they need. Real security demands more than the correct operational decisions by trained and properly funded professionals.\u201d Corbyn said that government mistakes \u201cin no way absolve terrorists of blame for their murderous actions\u201d, but that foreign policy had also \u201cfuelled, not reduced that threat\u201d. \u201cSixteen years ago, I warned against the invasion and occupation of Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cI said it would set off a spiral of conflict, hate, misery, desperation \u2026 that will fuel the wars, the conflict, the terrorism and the misery of future generations. It did, and we are still living with the consequences today.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
