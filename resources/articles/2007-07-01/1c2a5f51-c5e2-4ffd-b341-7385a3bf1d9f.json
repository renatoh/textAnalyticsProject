For a start, civil aircraft is not a market so much as a duopoly, a face-off between two continental champions, Europe's Airbus and America's Boeing. Not much scope for serious competition there. Nor are aircraft consumers subject to the same taxes as, say, motorists. Jet fuel remains untaxed, while buying a plane and even servicing the thing is not subject to VAT. This is a market in the same way that Sunny Delight is orange juice. A similar squinty-eyed logic made the unveiling this week of Boeing's new \"Dreamliner\" a media event, attended by all the fervour and fuss that term implies, when it was nothing more than rolling an aeroplane out on to some tarmac, having it filmed and photographed, then putting it back in its hangar. There will be no flight for some time and delivery to a real live customer won't happen until next spring. From the Wright Brothers onwards, flying has been a romantic business, but what excited people about this plane was its environmental credentials. Nicknamed with due speed the \"Greenliner\", Boeing's new baby will use less fuel, produce fewer carbon emissions and be quieter to boot. This was music to the ears of all who consider flying the travellers' equivalent of cream cakes - naughty but nice - and to others, like President Bush, counting on new technology and markets to deliver answers to those pesky green questions. The Times's conclusion yesterday was \"Market forces can be relied on to bring forward lower-carbon air travel.\" Which is almost exactly what the Dreamliner does not prove. This is Boeing's first new jet since 1995, which is a long time to wait for improvements in fuel efficiency. Certainly, airlines - as much as any green lobbyist - have been waiting ages for planes that guzzle less gas. More importantly, any manufacturer selling greener aeroplanes is a bit like a kebab van flogging doners with a third less fat; they may not be as bad for you, but they still do damage. In the case of air travel, the harm is rising steeply. Airlines argue that they are the source of around 2% of global CO2 emissions. That sounds low, but only because most of the world doesn't yet fly (in the UK the figure is closer to 13%). That is changing, with 5% more passengers around the world boarding planes every year - growth which more than wipes out any of the green gains made by the Dreamliner. When it comes to planes and the environment, there are ways in which we don't trust markets enough. Maybe we should put planes on a genuine level playing field, making both the craft and of course travel subject to the same tax as other forms of transport. That way, the true cost of flying would be readily apparent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
