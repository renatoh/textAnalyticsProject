Things that seemed both inevitable and desirable just a few decades ago have turned out to be entirely wrong. Yet neglecting to peer into tomorrow carries risks of its own, not least a failure to identify and lessen risk itself. Design and infrastructure consultants Atkins have been applying themselves to the task of anticipating how the city needs to evolve from now until 2050. A document entitled Future Proofing London is the wide-ranging and cogent result. The aim is to sustain what the report terms London\u2019s \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d as a world city. Valuably, it sees the pursuit of this goal as closely aligned with lessening the inequality and enhancing the greenness of the metropolis. The opposite outcomes would in each case be menaces to London. Four threats altogether are listed, the first of which is - very topically - a failure to meet housing need. Neglecting to foster economic diversity completes the quartet. Ignore these risks, Atkins says, and you end up with a London that\u2019s angrier, dirtier, more volatile and less equipped than it should be to innovate and adapt to shifts in the global economy. Address them, and you can build a city of social equity, environmental congeniality and resilient business agility. I\u2019ll take option two, if that\u2019s OK. So, how do we ensure its delivery? The report argues that \u201cthe interplay between infrastructure and social and economic development\u201d will be the key factor. The strength of governance is seen as crucial, with a good co-ordination between the mayor, the boroughs and national government and with neighbouring authorities outside Greater London essential. Great stress is placed on the capacity of the planning process to shape that interplay in the ways required: to ensure that investment nurtures new industries, improves the urban environment, creates opportunities to share in the common wealth and generate the homes that Londoners on low and middle incomes need. There\u2019s a strong theme throughout of energising Outer London, culminating in a proposal for a \u201cmajor strategic programme\u201d to intensify housing, add orbital rail links, repurpose retail and office space and nourish new kinds of \u201cmicro-manufacturing\u201d. The authors urge that transport, housing and other public investments be \u201ctargeted directly at those who are currently the least well served,\u201d rather than reinforcing London\u2019s present spatial structure. The whole thing is rich in insights and ideas. I\u2019ve particularly warmed to the idea of the London Plan\u2019s development Opportunity Areas being thought of as \u201ccurated clusters\u201d whereby the \u201cbig bang\u201d approach to major regeneration schemes gives way to a more democratic, flexible and community-minded approach, respectful of existing local culture. You might describe the 130 pages of Future Proofing London as a sort of manifesto, one that emanates from a part of the private sector essential to the city\u2019s evolution. As you\u2019d expect it takes no side politically, though it is critical of both the existing London Plan, the separate, longer-term London Infrastructure Plan and the relationship between them. It also recommends, as part of a green infrastructure approach, a \u201cpan London strategic review of the Green Belt\u201d so that some parts of it could be used for housing and more of it be made accessible to the public - a sensible view that terrifies all types of politicians, a notable exception being David Lammy. What is indisputable - and pretty much common ground across the ideological spectrum - is that the scale and pace of change in London are so large that urgent, imaginative action is vital. Using projections supplied by Oxford Economics, Atkins reckons the population boom will be even greater than the London Plan expects, passing 11 million in 20 years\u2019 time and reaching 12 million by 2050. Economic growth is predicted to be slower than in the past 15 years, but still rapid enough for there to be 6.3 million jobs in London by 2026, which is 14 years sooner than anticipated by the infrastructure plan. There is an art to managing such spectacular success and this piece of work is a rewarding tutorial on how it might be mastered. Read the report for yourself here.
