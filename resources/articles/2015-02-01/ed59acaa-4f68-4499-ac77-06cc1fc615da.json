If the bill is passed journalists and their sources will face an even more difficult reporting environment that jeopardises public interest reporting in Australia. On Friday the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security recommended that a series of amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act should be passed. The committee is made up of Labor, Liberal and National MPs and senators. When a bipartisan report is made by the committee it generally indicates both Labor and the Liberal party will support the bill, guaranteeing its passage through the Senate. Throughout the committee hearings concerns were raised about the privacy risks for Australians surrounding the proposal, the necessity of it and how key aspects of the legislation would operate. A small number of these concerns have been addressed in the committee\u2019s recommendations. The attorney general\u2019s power to determine which agencies can access metadata would be curbed, and the dataset for collection would be enshrined in the act, rather than by regulation made by the attorney general. The committee also recommended that the government make a \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d to the upfront costs of the scheme, although they did not make a detailed assessment of what this would be. But a glaring omission by the committee is the risk posed to press freedom in Australia if the bill is passed. Australia\u2019s warrantless system of metadata access already severely endangered journalists and their sources. Because there is no warrant requirement for access to phone and web data, it can be requested by law enforcement agencies in the pursuit of journalists\u2019 sources. This means that call logs of journalists can easily be requested by law enforcement agencies. These types of leak investigations occur with alarming frequency, and as Guardian Australia has reported previously, they tend to occur with reporting of sensitive and important issues such as reporting around asylum seekers. The data retention bill will compound these existing risks, and further enhance the chilling effect of government sources who may be considering speaking out on matters of public interest. This is largely through ensuring a far greater array of data that must be retained by telecommunications companies, particularly surrounding IP information and location data. Here\u2019s how it works; when a person uses the internet on a device they are assigned a particular IP address. At the moment this data is held inconsistently across the telecommunications industry. But the blanket, mass retention of it that will be enforced by the government will ensure that sources face far greater risks if they choose to speak out on matters of public interest. Location-based data could be requested to find intersecting points of contact for journalists and government employees suspected of leaking. IP logs of the use of particular email accounts could also be requested to determine who has logged in to an account at a particular time to work out when journalists have communicated with a certain person in government. And phone call logs (although they are generally already retained now voluntarily by providers) can also still be easily requested. None of this requires a warrant. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Guardian Australia and a consortium of other media organisations have raised repeated concerns about the data retention bill during the hearings. A common theme running through their submissions is that, at the very least, a warrant should be required for investigations involving access to journalists\u2019 metadata. But the committee has delayed dealing with this issue. Instead of resolving it in the current report, it chose only to \u201cacknowledge the importance\u201d of press freedom in Australia, and will compile a further report due in three months separately on the issues surrounding journalists. This leaves journalists and their sources in a precarious position. It will mean that the data retention bill is likely to pass, while further consideration is given to the issues surrounding journalists. And at the end of this subsequent review, there is no guarantee that any amendments will be made to enhance protections for the press. The government has repeatedly demanded that the passage of this bill is an urgent priority. Journalists around Australia must make their own voices heard to ensure that our politicians understand that the protection of their sources should be no less a priority."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
