As the coronavirus pandemic took hold of the UK in early spring, and the country was locked down for the first time, domestic abuse charities saw the number of calls to their helplines increase by up to 50%. Experts have warned that abusers and their partners having to self-isolate together at home may lead to an increase in abusive behaviour and violence because of the pressure-cooker effect of being trapped indoors. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, and Jess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic abuse and safeguarding, have written to Priti Patel, the home secretary, urging her to bring forward a package of support for organisations working with victims and survivors of domestic abuse. Thomas-Symonds told the Guardian: \u201cFor too many people, home just isn\u2019t a safe place and as England moves into a lockdown it is vital that services are supported to address domestic abuse. \u201cWe have convened experts from across the sector and it\u2019s clear that they are deeply worried about the impact this lockdown could have. \u201cThe government must not repeat the mistakes of March, in being too slow to act. That is why I have written to the home secretary, calling for the UK government to urgently set out a clear, well-resourced plan for addressing domestic abuse and supporting vital frontline agencies.\u201d On Tuesday, Thomas-Symonds and Phillips met representatives of more than 15 organisations working to support victims of domestic abuse including Women\u2019s Aid, Action for Children, Refuge, Barnardo\u2019s, Southall Black Sisters, Latin American Women\u2019s Rights Service, Galop, SafeLives and Stay Safe East. In their letter to Patel, they highlight issues raised by these organisations, including: Significant concerns about long-term sustainable funding for the domestic abuse support sector, and the risk of redundancies during the pandemic. Plans for addressing rising demand over the course of, and following, the second lockdown, including services for children. Concerns that provision of specialised services such as for black, Asian and minority ethnic victims, migrant victims, LGBTQ+ victims, male victims and services for disabled victims are an \u201cafterthought\u201d rather than a core element of planning. A call to continue to raise public awareness of domestic and sexual violence, ensuring press briefings are utilised. Access to domestic violence perpetrator programmes. The letter adds: \u201cFor some, this period has led to an escalation of abuse and violence, and the coronavirus crisis has created further barriers for victims to escape abuse or bring perpetrators to justice. \u201cFrontline organisations are doing extraordinary work to support people at an incredibly difficult time; the very least they deserve is the necessary support from the government.\u201d The Counting Dead Women project told MPs that between 23 March and 12 April, at least 16 domestic abuse killings had taken place \u2013 much higher than the average for the time of year \u2013 while calls to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline were up 49% three weeks after lockdown was introduced. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cHome is not a safe place for everyone which is why the government is safeguarding those at risk of domestic abuse during this pandemic. \u201cWe continue to work with charities and the domestic abuse commissioner on an unprecedented package of support. This includes \u00a32m to ensure helplines and online services are easily accessible, our #YouAreNotAlone national awareness raising campaign and \u00a376m for charities supporting survivors.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
