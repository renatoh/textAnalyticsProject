On this chilling fourth solo record, she returns to the lie of a post-racial America. Some of her poetry, sometimes verging into rap, could be chanted through a bullhorn at a protest, such as LA92\u2019s \u201cLAPD on PCP, body bag body bag for you and me\u201d, and this pissed-off fervour is bracing. But she\u2019s even more powerful when she\u2019s calm, as on Shadowgrams, where she surveys ongoing evidence of colonialism in the UK, Portgual and elsewhere like an NGO worker. The Myth Hold Weight is one of her best ever tracks, an endlessly spilling rhyme scheme dotted with powerful wisdom: \u201cDon\u2019t let death compliment you / no matter how ugly you feel.\u201d Her backings are stunningly realised: collages of sawing strings, tones of meandering frequency, and drums that gallop like a horse let loose to nowhere. Lurching in the hull of the mix are sampled vocals from across history, snatches of what sound like gospel or field songs. This chaos, perhaps, is the sound of black America trying to haul itself into stability but being gaslighted at every turn. There is a moment of black humour, in every sense, when Paul Robeson suddenly looms into view singing slavery-era spiritual Nobody Knows the Trouble I\u2019ve Seen \u2013 coming amid the violent whirl of Moor Mother\u2019s productions, you\u2019re left thinking: no shit. This album announces that the fight for equality is not done, but rages in our ears."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
