Today, however, as the subject continues to disappear from many university syllabuses, there are a growing number of men enrolling on courses with blatantly feminist content and perspectives. Daniel Newman, 20, decided to take a women, gender and power module at Westminster University, having already done one on masculinity. \"In the masculinity course I was being told that men are disadvantaged, but in this module we get the other perspective, about women's oppression,\" says Newman. \"I must say, I am more convinced by the feminist perspective.\" Does he ever feel odd, being one of only a handful of men in the lecture theatre? \"No, that doesn't bother me,\" he says, \"maybe because I grew up in a family full of women.\" Women's studies courses or modules can include topics such as women and media representation; women and the labour market; the social construction of masculinity and femininity; gender and sexuality; health, body image and reproductive rights; and the intersection of gender with racial and class identities. A different dynamic You have to wonder whether the inclusion of men on feminist courses might alter the dynamic, or make women feel uncomfortable. Irene Gedalof, senior lecturer in women's studies at London Metropolitan University, finds that the men who take these courses are usually already critical of prescribed gender roles, and therefore \"behave appropriately\". \"The men I teach are interested and engaged. The female students are neither intimidated by them nor hostile to them.\" Some women believe it is inappropriate to have mixed WS classes, as it can hinder discussion on sensitive issues. Madeline Coy, a researcher on sexual violence, took a WS course in the late 1990s, and says it was marred by the presence of one man on her course. \"One of the lecturers opened her first seminar by saying, tongue in cheek, 'I see there is a man on this course. I will make it my business to ensure he does not finish it.'\" Although there were one or two women who mothered him,\" says Coy, \"most of us were pissed off because we could not be open about stuff like sexual violence with him in the room.\" Do the women on such courses ever revert to \"traditional\" gender roles when there are men in the class? \"They don't turn into silly girls in their presence,\" says Gedalof, \"although I have in the past witnessed some trying to get attention, or defend them against criticism. But it is always interesting to watch the dynamic.\" Twenty years ago, when WS was relatively new and located within a context of the women's liberation movement, there was controversy as to whether men should even be allowed to take such courses. \"But students around now were not engaged in the separatist politics that were commonplace then,\" says Gedalof. \"Today there are men who want to learn from feminism, and believe it speaks to them as well as to women.\" Not all men with an interest in studying issues relating to gender agree. One male student (who asked not to be named), who chose a course exploring men and masculinity as opposed to women's studies, said he was there because he \"wanted to ask questions about why men are four times more likely to commit suicide or be homeless than women are. I found most courses on women's studies were very hostile to the idea; they didn't want me on the course.\" This tension between men who seek validation of their view that today's men are oppressed as a result of feminism, and those who accept that women share unequal power with men, can lead to a difficult job for course tutors and students alike. As courses on masculinity and \"men's studies\" become more popular in the UK, some men are surprised when they find significant emphasis is placed on a feminist analysis of masculinity, as opposed to \"men's movement\" propaganda. Jim Wild, a social work academic who took a postgraduate module on \"feminist perspectives\" in the early 1990s, has developed the UK's first course on men's studies, but from a pro-feminist perspective. He is concerned that some courses on masculinity have emerged as a backlash against women's studies. \"If you don't understand women's oppression,\" says Wild, \"you would not like WS courses.\" \"It is hard,\" acknowledges Wild, \"to teach a WS course and include stuff on violence against women without upsetting some men.\" Although women's studies courses are becoming more popular among male students, according to the academics running them I spoke to, it may not be long before WS becomes obsolete and is replaced with the more neutral-sounding gender studies. The course run by Gedalof is being replaced next year by one on equality and diversity, which will include disability, race and gender. \"The WS course ran for 20 years, and I am proud of that, but now is perhaps the time for a new, diverse way of viewing discrimination and oppression.\" Although many female students and lecturers welcome men's presence on such courses, there are those who believe that men can change the dynamic and prevent women discussing issues such as sexual violence as openly as if the courses were women only. Ruth Swirsky, principal lecturer in sociology and women's studies at the University of Westminster, who runs the feminist theory and sexual politics course, is pleased that both men and women have an interest in the topic. \"Largely, female students want men on these courses, as [their inclusion] adds an important gender perspective,\" she says. \"The men do not seem to have a problem with either being in the minority, or engaging with critical analysis of masculinity.\" Embarrassed Brits One third of Swirsky's students are men, a third of them being from the US. \"Brits are more inclined to be embarrassed about engaging with feminist politics than Americans,\" she says. Swirsky has found that American students, including the men, are \"much less likely to have a problem with the F word than British men.\" For Wild, the WS courses he took broadened his thinking around gender, resulting in him becoming a \"feminist ally\". \"I felt completely and utterly included by the female students,\" says Wild, \"even though I was the only man on the course.\" A number of men I spoke to tell me they were motivated to take courses on feminism because of the enthusiasm of the lecturers for their subject. \"The women who taught me on women's history and feminist political thought were passionate about their subjects and totally inspiring,\" says Mark Hewitt, a 33-year-old primary school teacher. On his courses he learned about issues such as black feminism, and feminist critique of prostitution and pornography. \"I saw things from a perspective that would never have occurred to me before,\" he says. Newman shares Hewitt's enthusiasm. \"The way feminism is taught on these courses has really made me think,\" he says, \"and it has opened my eyes to a new way of looking at men and women in society.\" Hewitt says he was \"not interested in feminism before taking courses on feminism and women's issues\". If he had not taken the courses, he says, he would not be so keen on teaching his pupils about women's history. Thereby, a new generation of boys and girls will benefit from the knowledge and perspective that just one man picked up from a type of course that many would argue is going out of fashion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
