Having spent several days insisting that nothing would stand in the way of their tariff on prize money when the new Flat season on turf begins on Wednesday, the body that claims to represent owners, trainers, jockeys and stable staff announced that the tariff will now be \"suspended\" for all Class One races in 2011. Figures for acceptable purses in the most high-profile events, worked out to the last pound in anal-retentive detail, are suddenly irrelevant. British military history might read rather differently had Alan Morcombe, the chief executive of the Horsemen's Group, been in command of the Light Brigade. The 600 would have galloped into the Valley of Death, stopped to sniff the air and then galloped straight back out again. In this case, however, the catalyst for the retreat appears to be, somewhat bizarrely, the sudden arrival of reinforcements. Last Wednesday, at Godolphin's annual pre-season media morning in Dubai, Simon Crisford, one of Sheikh Mohammed's most trusted advisors, made it clear that Godolphin and, by implication, the rest of the Maktoum family's bloodstock operations would refuse to run their horses in any sub-tariff event this year. Support for the tariff from the world's most powerful owner initially seemed like quite a coup, but the tariff was such a flawed idea in the first place that it was always likely to fall victim to the curse of unintended consequences. In this case, it soon became clear that Sheikh Mohammed, a man whose word is his bond, had just put his name to a potential boycott of a fair chunk of the top-end British programme. There were even several races at Royal Ascot, one of his favourite meetings, that would not have been guaranteed to meet the tariff without a boost to the purse, and it would be unthinkable to work out a season-long programme for a string such as Godolphin's without knowing for sure that it can include the Royal meeting. Even if every sub-tariff purse at Royal Ascot was raised to meet the Horsemen's demands, the Sheikh, ever the diplomat, would hardly want to be in a position where he might be accused of having blackmailed the Queen. The fundamental problem with the tariff, as with so many owner-led campaigns on prize money, is that it suggests the value of a race resides in its cash value and nothing else. Morcombe, who drew up the tariff, did at least concede in a statement announcing the HG's U-turn yesterday that \"horsemen have many reasons for deciding whether to enter races where the tariff is not being met and this is most relevant at Class One level where there are strong business and racing reasons for running horses in races. On occasions, these go beyond prize-money.\" The reality, though, is that the \"many reasons\" do not go beyond prize-money \"on occasions\", but every day of the year, and at every level of the sport. The ultimate value of a Derby winner is many millions of pounds in stud fees on top of the \u00a3750,000 or so first prize, but a handicap at Pontefract may have a value far in excess of the purse from an individual owner's point of view, perhaps because it is local, or one of their favourite tracks, or for that matter, one of their horse's favourite tracks. The tariff surely cannot survive the embarrassing volte-face. Having let the major players off the hook, the Horsemen's Group cannot expect the smaller owners to toe their line. Then again, it was a Wonderland idea in the first place, so perhaps things will keep getting curiouser and curiouser."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
