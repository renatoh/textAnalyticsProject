This includes the Moscow to Beijing stretch. Then we will fly or take a boat to Japan, where we will stop to take in some culture. I know it will be hard work travelling for so long with a child who will then be 18 months old, but I think we will all get a lot from it. Please advise me on finding and booking trains, unmissable stops to make and routes to take or to avoid? Would the language barrier be a problem? Kelly Taylor, Guildford If you went as fast as possible you could do the overland journey in less than a month. For help with the Russia to China stretch, search the Ask the Experts archive for 'trans-Siberian' at www.observer.co.uk/travel/. After China, make your way down into Laos or Vietnam, through South-east Asia to Indonesia. you run out of land here and need to take a flight from Bali or Jakarta to Darwin, Cairns or another Australian city. If time isn't an issue, take six months and use this route or the traditional overland route via Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, Nepal and into China through Tibet. Overland travel is not possible through Burma. Languages may be a problem in places, but this shouldn't stop you. You could rehearse with a shorter road trip to give you a taste of life on the road with a toddler and show what you will need to take with you. Remember, an overland trip has plenty of early exit points should the journey prove too much. Lonely Planet's Travel with Children (\u00a38.99) is full of tips for parents on the road. Masta (www.masta.org) is a great place to research the medical aspects of the trip. I am a single woman in her early forties with sons aged 12 and 15. Next summer is likely to be the last when we all go on holiday together. We want to go somewhere warm. Is there a singles holiday for the over-35s which is not a dating agency and has activities for teenagers? Elaine Dawkins, by email Tall Stories (01932 252 002; www.tallstories.co.uk) has adventure holidays in Austria, France and Spain and runs family weeks for parents with teenagers, from about \u00a3500 a head - cycling, paragliding, trekking and rafting. Egypt's Red Sea resorts are good value. Try Scuba Diving Safaris (0870 746 1266; www.scuba-diving-safaris.co.uk). Or go cycling or walking in Britain, using youth hostels (www.yha.org.uk). See www.sustrans.org.uk for cycling. Letter of the week I want to take our daughter to Manila in the Philippines, where she was born in December 1985 while we were there for my husband's job. I plan to combine this with a visit to Hong Kong and, possibly, two days in Thailand, making a total of about 10 days. My husband will stay at home with our other three children. What is the best way to see Manila? Is it a good idea in a large city centre hotel, and which is the best time of year to go? Fran Lamont, Bath Manila's size, heat and pollution can be overwhelming, so try to balance a good look round with a few days in the cooler highlands or on the beach at Puerto Galera on Mindoro, a flight or bus and boat ride from the capital. You probably already know the city well, but the Spanish colonial fortifications and the bustle of Chinatown are a must. Tour the Chinese cemetery to learn how wealthy locals are buried in mausoleums with chandeliers, air conditioning and hot and cold running water. Using an upmarket hotel gives you a pool, air conditioning and home comforts. The Bayview Park (www.bayviewparkhotel.com) has a rooftop pool and gym and rooms from about \u00a340 a head per night. Manila also has pockets of extreme poverty. Seek local advice on where is safe.
