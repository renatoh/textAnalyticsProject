No longer content with timid approaches, Bezos made a splash on Monday by agreeing to pay $250m for the Washington Post after two other major publications \u2013 the Boston Globe and Newsweek \u2013 sold for a fraction of that over the past two days. Bezos is also getting a passel of smaller newspapers in the sale, including Greater Washington Publishing, the Gazette newspapers, Express, El Tiempo Latino and Robinson Terminal, according to a memo from the Washington Post publisher and chief executive, Katharine Weymouth. Bezos, 49, in many ways fits the profile of the classic newspaper owner: rich and politically active \u2013 he is a libertarian and actively supported gay marriage \u2013 and nearing the second stage of his career, after making his fortune. He draws a nominal salary from Amazon but his founders' shares, private investments and other holdings are worth about $22bn, according to Bloomberg. His personality as a leader is best seen in his comments on Amazon. While other giant companies may have \"a conqueror mentality,\" he told Fortune Magazine last year, \"we think of ourselves as explorers.\" That sense of adventure is evident in the name of his private investment firm, Bezos Expeditions. Through the firm, Bezos owns stakes in media companies \u2013 and media-intensive companies \u2013 including Twitter and the financial journalism startup Business Insider, which was founded by former Wall Street analyst, Henry Blodget. The investment in Business Insider, which came in April, clocked in at under $5m. \"Jeff's investment grew out of a dinner he and I had about a year ago,\" Blodget wrote in April. \"We talked about the business, and he was excited about it. (He sees some parallels with Amazon). A few months later, he expressed an interest in investing. My reaction was basically 'Hell, yeah!'\" Weymouth, whose family, the Grahams, have owned the Washington Post for eight decades, seemed similarly enthused in a letter to readers, in which she spoke of Bezos's intentions for the paper \u2013 namely, to push it into the digital future and leave it alone. \"His focus is on the essential role that our journalism has on dialogue and the flow of information in our society,\" Weymouth wrote. She will continue to run the paper. Both Blodget and Weymouth have praised Bezos's tendency to favor long-term investments \u2013 knowing that the journalism industry is currently a long way from a feasible business model. In many ways, the Washington Post sale is also an indicator of a kind of cultural baton-passing. Bezos and his fellow tech entrepreneurs are taking the role in society once allotted to socially and politically powerful Washington-based families like the Grahams. Bezos is a philanthropist through his Bezos Family Foundation, which is run by his mother, Jackie, to benefit childhood education. Last year, he and his wife, Mackenzie, donated $2.5m to a campaign supporting gay marriage at the behest of a former employee, Jennifer Cast. According to the Seattle Times, the note from Bezos to Cast read: \"Jen, this is right for so many reasons. We're in for $2.5 million. Jeff &amp; Mackenzie.\" In business, Bezos has a reputation as a cerebral perfectionist with a tendency to micromanage. He is said to start senior staff meetings with a 30-minute period of silent contemplation over six-page memos, a practice that Fortune attributed to his \"fondness for the written word\". Bezos said in a note to employees, however, that he plans to let the management team run the Washington Post without his interference, and that he plans to stay in Seattle. Wags on Twitter were cracking jokes on Monday night about Bezos's new venture. The upshot of many comments, however, was that his Washington Post stake will test if not his fondness for the written word, then his patience for profit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
