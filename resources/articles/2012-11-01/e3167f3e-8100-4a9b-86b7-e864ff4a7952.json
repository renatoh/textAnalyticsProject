Autonomy, in its independent life, was a company that seemed to be in perpetual war with half the City's analysts over accounting treatments. Even at the time of the takeover offer last year, technology specialists blogged furiously about aggressive revenue recognition, cash conversion and the like. And let's not forget the entertaining spat between Autonomy founder Mike Lynch and Oracle's Larry Ellison. In short, the message to Hewlett-Packard ought to have been obvious: if you are spending $10bn (\u00a36bn) on a company with annual sales of roughly $1bn you had better be damn sure the business is of the highest quality. Meg Whitman, Hewlett-Packard's chief executive, argued on Tuesday that all the right checks were made. KPMG was hired as an adviser to check on Autonomy's accounts, which were audited by Deloitte. Investment bankers at Barclays and Perella Weinberg gave a \"fair value\" opinion on Autonomy. And, yes, the company's management was aware of the internet rumours. So why did all these fine firms miss what Hewlett-Packard now claims was a misstatement of Autonomy's accounts? \"When you are lied to it is hard to find,\" said Whitman. Lynch denies the allegations in full so, inevitably, the matter will be settled in court. The facts will decide whether there was a \"wilful effort\" on the part of Autonomy's management to mislead investors and potential buyers. Even if that can be proved, however, Hewlett-Packard's investors might ask whether their management was too driven by the desire to do a deal, any deal, that offered the prospect of a fresh start. Remember the context here. Hewlett-Packard was a former computer titan fallen on hard times. Too many acquisitions, such as EDS and Palm, had turned sour and new-boy chief executive L\u00e9o Apotheker was desperate to find an instant fix. He decided to get out of making personal computers and buy Autonomy at an almighty takeover premium of 64%. The PC strategy was immediately reversed by Whitman, who arrived soon afterwards. But the price paid for Autonomy was otherworldly \u2013 it smacked of a management team that was too anxious to make a hardware-for-software switch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
