THE BREAKDOWN Ireland have made the choke tackle their speciality, a two-pronged assault on a ball-carrier when one tackler holds him up and the other steals the ball. Wales were turned over when forwards became isolated in possession and it was not until the second-half that they started to win the breakdown. Scotland had a big back row like Ireland at Twickenham last week, but England moved them around and made the tackle area a contest for the ball on the floor. 2. THE SCRUM Ireland lost heavily at Twickenham last year after being scrummaged into submission in the wet, suffering the indignity of conceding a penalty try. They lost Mike Ross to an early injury and played most of the match with two loosehead props. Wales thought they could gain an advantage up front against Ireland last Saturday and failed, giving Ireland's back row licence to dominate. 3. THE MIDFIELD The anticipated duel between Brian O'Driscoll and Manu Tuilagi will have to wait with England leaving their Samoan on the bench, probably bringing him on to vex a tiring defence. They are the two leading contenders for the Lions' No13 jersey but could end up partnering each other in the midfield. England used runners from deep positions against Scotland, and Ireland have, in the past, been fallible in the outside channel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
