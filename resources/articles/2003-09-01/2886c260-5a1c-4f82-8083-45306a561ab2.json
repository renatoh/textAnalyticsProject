The move comes after the president of the Turkish Football Federation was quoted making inflammatory comments about the match. Haluk Ulusoy criticised the England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson for warning fans that their safety was in jeopardy if they defied advice and travelled to Istanbul for next month's game. He is quoted in yesterday's newspapers as saying: \"I think Eriksson has forgotten the Heysel disaster. Of course he doesn't want England fans in Turkey because he doesn't want them to see a defeat. \"Anyway, he will be sacked from the England job after the game because he will have no credibility left and he will only be fit to manage the national team of Patagonia.\" Uefa are understood to be concerned by the developments. Mike Lee, Uefa's communications director, said: \"The comments are, to say the least, unfortunate. The cooperation established at our meeting with the two FAs in the summer has to be maintained. \"It's important that any public statements are calm and appropriate. There's a lot more at stake than simply a football match. We will be contacting the Turkish FA president to seek an explanation.\" Due to a history of trouble, the FA have asked fans not to travel to Istanbul, where a draw for England on October 11 should be enough to see them win the group."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
