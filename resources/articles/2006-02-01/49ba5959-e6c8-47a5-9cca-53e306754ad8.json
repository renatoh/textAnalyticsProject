The referee Keith Yeo, who had not issued a single yellow card, called a halt after a five-minute consultation with his assistants. The FA statistician David Barber said: \"In my experience this is extremely rare. If it does happen, it's more likely to be at Sunday league level. I've been to 5,056 matches, at all levels, and I've never seen it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
