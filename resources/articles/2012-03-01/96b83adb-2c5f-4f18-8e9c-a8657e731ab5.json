What's not to admire? Ozwald Boateng has good reason to be full of himself. I wouldn't want him as a friend, but so what? angelamarica On theguardian.com Ozwald Boateng needs to read Decca Aitkenhead's interview. Twice. Robstacle On theguardian.com Does it get any better than breakfast in bed and Mikael Birkkj\u00e6r? Sadly, his wonderful wardrobes (with one exception) cost as much as a monthly mortgage and family food shop combined. A complete language course in Danish may well be cheaper.

I feel a massive cigar, two bottles of cooking oil and 10 litres of cider coming on. awliet94 On theguardian.com Sam Wollaston is correct when he says that the Toyota Hilux wouldn't be considered a \"proper pick-up\" in the US. At 36.7mpg, it is far too fuel-efficient for American roads.
