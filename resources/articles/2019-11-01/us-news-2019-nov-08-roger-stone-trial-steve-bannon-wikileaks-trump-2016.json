The ex-chief executive of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign testified for less than an hour at the trial of Stone, accused of witness tampering and lying to Congress about his dealings with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website. Bannon, 65, denied that the campaign had direct contact with WikiLeaks or its founder, Julian Assange, who released emails obtained by Russian hackers that were damaging to Trump\u2019s rival Hillary Clinton. Instead, he said, he came to understand that Stone, a self-described dirty trickster, was the key intermediary. \u201cI was led to believe he had a relationship with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange,\u201d said Bannon, sitting in the witness box in black jacket, two black shirts and grey trousers. \u201cHe had a relationship, or told me he had a relationship with WikiLeaks. It was something I think he would frequently mention or talk about, when we talked about other things.\u201d The former head of conservative website Breitbart News continued: \u201cThe campaign had no official access to WikiLeaks or to Julian Assange. But Roger would be considered if we needed an access point.\u201d But although Stone repeatedly \u201cimplied that he had a connection with WikiLeaks,\u201d he never stated it directly, Bannon added. The US district court for the District of Columbia has been told of phone calls between Trump \u2013 who lavished praise on WikiLeaks during the campaign \u2013 and Stone, and been shown emails and text messages between Stone, Bannon and other campaign associates. Bannon testified that he and Stone spoke somewhere between six and 12 times during the presidential campaign. In an email in the summer of 2016, Stone emailed Bannon to say: \u201cTrump can still win, but time is running out. I know how to win, but it ain\u2019t pretty.\u201d In court, Bannon was asked what he thought the message meant. He said: \u201cRoger is an expert in the tougher side of politics. When you\u2019re this far behind you\u2019re going to have to use every tool in the tool box. Opposition research, dirty tricks, the kind of things campaigns use when you need to make up some ground.\u201d \ufeffBannon was a reluctant witness at Stone\u2019s trial, under subpoena. He said he had been also interviewed several times by Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team. As he left the court building and climbed into a black SUV, Bannon told reporters: \u201cI was compelled to testify. I was under subpoena by Mueller. I was under subpoena by the House. I got a handwritten subpoena in my House testimony, I was forced to go to the grand jury and I\u2019m forced and compelled to come here today.\u201d Earlier on Friday, comedian and radio talk show Randy Credico told the court Stone pressured him into supporting lies he spun to Congress, even threatening his pet dog, Bianca, which he has owned for 12 years. Credico read out to the court an email he received from Stone in April last year. Describing Credico as a \u201cstoolie\u201d and a \u201crat\u201d, it warned: \u201cMy lawyers are dying to rip you to shreds. I\u2019m going to take that dog away from you.\u201d Stone pressed him to \u201cgo along\u201d with a false account of the operative\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks during the campaign, Credico alleged. \u201cHe wanted me to go along with this narrative.\u201d Credico also told the jury that Stone was fond of alluding to the film The Godfather Part II to intimidate him. Judge Amy Berman Jackson warned the jury against doing their own research on the case, \u201cnot even downloading The Godfather on Netflix\u201d. Stone, 67, has pleaded not guilty to charges of obstructing justice, witness tampering and lying to the congressional committee. The case adjourned until next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
