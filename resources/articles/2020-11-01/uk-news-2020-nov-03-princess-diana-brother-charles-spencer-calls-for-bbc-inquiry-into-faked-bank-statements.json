A spokesperson said the BBC was willing to consider any fresh evidence Earl Spencer could provide about Bashir\u2019s actions in securing a 1995 interview with his sister. However, the corporation said its ability to investigate further was limited because the reporter was seriously unwell with Covid-related complications. On Tuesday, Spencer accused the BBC of a \u201cwhitewash\u201d over faked bank statements that allegedly helped to secure a historic Panorama interview with his sister. He said Bashir had used \u201csheer dishonesty\u201d to win the trust of Diana, Princess of Wales, for the interview, where she famously reflected on her relationship with Prince Charles by saying there were \u201cthree of us in this marriage\u201d. The earl said he uncovered a letter, allegedly written by Bashir in 1995, in which the journalist referenced false rumours that were circulating about the Prince of Wales having an affair with the couple\u2019s nanny, Tiggy Legge-Bourke. Accusing Bashir of \u201cyellow journalism\u201d, Spencer said the BBC journalist had also used forged bank statements created by a graphic designer to coerce the princess into talking to the programme. The statements, entirely wrongly, purported to show that two senior courtiers were being paid by the security services for information on Diana. The new BBC director general, Tim Davie, has apologised for the use of fake bank statements, which were said to have been instrumental in securing the interview, which was watched by 23 million viewers when it was broadcast 25 years ago this week. Now Spencer has demanded a formal inquiry into the tactics used by Bashir to obtain the interview, which were recently re-examined in a Channel 4 documentary. In a letter to Davie, seen by the Daily Mail, Spencer said the corporation had failed to accept \u201cthe full gravity of this situation\u201d. He wrote: \u201cIf it were not for me seeing these statements, I would not have introduced Bashir to my sister. In turn, he would have remained just one of thousands of journalists hoping that he/she had a tiny chance of getting her to speak to them, with no realistic prospect of doing so.\u201d He called on the BBC to offer his family and the public a posthumous apology for Bashir\u2019s alleged deception. The issue of the false bank statements was first investigated in 1996, when BBC executive Tony Hall \u2013 later the corporation\u2019s director general \u2013 cleared Bashir of wrongdoing. This was on the basis of a handwritten note Diana allegedly sent the BBC, in which she said the forged bank statements were not the reason she agreed to the interview. \u201cWhy did Tony Hall\u2019s inquiry not seek the truth from me?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhy did it bend over backwards to whitewash Bashir? Who knew the extent of his yellow journalism when securing what Hall calls the interview of the decade \u2026 or of the generation?\u2019 Spencer added: \u201cThe sheer dishonesty of what I\u2019ve seen in the BBC 25 years ago, both in Bashir and his colleague\u2019s actions in securing the interview, and the whitewash under Tony Hall\u2019s name, demands it.\u201d A BBC spokesperson said the corporation was happy to apologise again and pledged to investigate any \u201csubstantive new information\u201d. They added: \u201cWe have asked Earl Spencer to share further information with the BBC. Unfortunately, we are hampered at the moment by the simple fact that we are unable to discuss any of this with Martin Bashir, as he is seriously unwell. When he is well, we will of course hold an investigation into these new issues.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
