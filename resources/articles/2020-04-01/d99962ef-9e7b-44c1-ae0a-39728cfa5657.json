The US has suffered more confirmed coronavirus deaths than any other country, and on Saturday was poised to soon reach 20,000 Covid-19 fatalities, new data indicated. Cuomo undercuts De Blasio bid to keep New York schools shut until September. New York governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio once again had differing opinions on who has authority to implement certain Covid-19 policies. Every US state is now under a disaster declaration. Wyoming has become the 50th, and final, US state to be under a disaster declaration following approval by Donald Trump on Saturday. That means for for the first time in history every US state is under a disaster declaration, which allows federal funds to be used by state and local governments during the pandemic. Republican who floated virus conspiracy says \u2018common sense has been my guide\u2019. Arkansas senator Tom Cotton told Fox News he did not believe virus originated in Wuhan market and said bioweapons link should not be ruled out With the realities of the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s disproportionate effect on America\u2019s black communities becoming more apparent with each passing day, NFL star Malcolm Jenkins has shared a video telling African Americans that \u201cwe must look out for ourselves\u201d. \u201cThank you to all of our first responders, our doctors and nurses who are on the front lines,\u201d said Jenkins, a two-time Super Bowl champion and one of the most visible political activists in the sports world. \u201cYou are our heroes. We thank you, we pray for you, we owe you a great debt. This message is for my black brothers and sisters: We must survive. This pandemic is real and the damage that is left in the wake of the coronavirus is realized mostly in our communities. Bad policy, institutional neglect and overexposure place us disproportionately in arm\u2019s reach of the dangers of this deadly virus. \u201cWe are the essential worker. We are the most impacted. Yet the focus of the resources aren\u2019t being invested in us. We cannot wait for a government that has never prioritized us; we must look out for ourselves. So take care of you first, share your resources, protect the elderly and stay home as much as possible. Please stay safe, stay healthy and survive. Because whether they know it or not, the world needs us \u2013 and we need us.\u201d The US Air Force Air Thunderbirds conducted a flyover in celebration of frontline workers, flying past all the major hospitals throughout the Las Vegas valley. Brigadier general Robert Novotny said: \u201cWe were looking at how we could continue to fly and also give back to the community with a salute to the real heroes out there on the front lines who are keeping us safe from the virus.\u201d Oklahoma State University football coach Mike Gundy has apologized for comments he made during a teleconference this week about the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cI have been made aware that comments from my press conference have offended some,\u201d Gundy said in a statement issued on Saturday. \u201cIt was never my intention to offend anyone and I apologize. My first priority is and will always be the student-athletes and doing what is best for the program and the university.\u201d Gundy has come under criticism since a Tuesday conference call with reporters where he said he hoped to have the team return to the on-campus football facilities on 1 May, in defiance of federal social-distancing guidelines. He said the the media has been overly negative in its coverage of what he called the \u201cChinese virus and added that if one of his players or coaches were to test positive after then, they would be \u201cquarantined just like we do people that get the flu\u201d. \u201cWe get people that get the flu during the season, we quarantine them, we treat them, we make sure they\u2019re healthy, we bring \u2018em back,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIt would be the same thing here, but at some point, we\u2019ve got to go back to work. We\u2019ve got to get these guys back in here. ... From what I read, the healthy people can fight this, the antibodies make it better. They\u2019re doing some blood transplants now with the people that have already gotten the disease, that have gotten over it that have the antibodies that can fight it. There\u2019s a lot of people who can figure this out. May 1\u2019s our goal. Don\u2019t know if it will happen. Players will come in after that.\u201d The remarks prompted a swift statement from the university, which said: \u201cWe will adhere to the advice of public health experts who are making informed decisions in the best interest of the citizens of our nation and state based on sound scientific data.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Gundy, whose annual salary is $5.13m, has whipped up controversy over his right-wing views. But USA Today\u2019s Dan Wolken made a salient point in a Wednesday op-ed that Gundy\u2019s political ideology is immaterial: Hey, according to \u201cDr. Gundy,\u201d what\u2019s the harm in 18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds possibly getting exposed to coronavirus? If they\u2019re healthy, it\u2019s all good, right? At any rate, we\u2019ve got to get moving, Gundy suggested, because paying salaries and \u201ccontinuing the economy in this state\u201d relies on the bodies of unpaid amateurs and people will \u201cfeel better\u201d watching football on TV. Herd immunity, right? That\u2019s actually what Dr. Gundy was getting at. In fact, he referred to players as \u201cthe herd of healthy people\u201d who can fight the virus, even though that is, uh, not exactly the way any of this works. None of this should be a surprise. Gundy has been edging toward the cliff of absurdity for a while now. In November 2018, he blamed \u201cliberalism\u201d for players transferring, saying \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in the snowflake.\u201d He acknowledged Tuesday he\u2019s getting a lot of his information these days from the ultra-conservative One America News Network, an outlet he described as objective and non-political despite its history of pushing debunked right-wing conspiracy theories related to the murder of Seth Rich, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor David Hogg. But this isn\u2019t really about Gundy\u2019s political ideology or his sources of information. It\u2019s about him saying the quiet part out loud regarding how many college coaches view their players. Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who floated a conspiracy theory which said the Chinese government created Covid-19 in a weapons lab claimed on Saturday that \u201ccommon sense has been my guide\u201d since he first learned of the outbreak in mid-January. \u201cNot Chinese communist lies. Not \u2018the models\u2019. Not so-called \u2018public-health experts\u2019. Just common sense. Many elected leaders have also been guided by common sense. Others haven\u2019t.\u201d The virus is believed to have originated in a market in Wuhan in which wild animals were sold. But in an appearance on Fox News in February, Cotton floated a conspiracy theory which suggests the virus was manufactured in a Chinese bioweapons facility. \u201cHere\u2019s what we do know,\u201d he said. \u201cThe virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market. Epidemiologists \u2026 have demonstrated that several of the original cases did not have any contact with that food market. That the virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market. \u201cSo we don\u2019t know where it originated. But we do know that we have to get to the bottom of that. We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China\u2019s only biosafety level four super-laboratory, that researches human infectious diseases. \u201cWe don\u2019t have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China\u2019s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all.\u201d A federal judge has ruled Kentucky\u2019s largest city cannot halt a drive-in church service planned for Easter. From the Associated Press: On Fire Christian Church had sued Louisville mayor Greg Fischer and the city after Fischer announced drive-in style religious gatherings were not allowed on Easter. US district judge Justin Walker sided with the church. \u201cOn Holy Thursday, an American mayor criminalized the communal celebration of Easter,\u201d Walker wrote in his sternly worded 20-page opinion. \u201cThat sentence is one that this Court never expected to see outside the pages of a dystopian novel, or perhaps the pages of The Onion.\u201d Walker added that \u201cThe mayor\u2019s decision is stunning. And it is, \u2018beyond all reason,\u2019 unconstitutional.\u201d Fischer had argued that drive-in church services weren\u2019t \u201cpractical or safe\u201d for the community. However, Walker noted that drive-thru restaurants and liquor stores were still allowed to operate. Coronavirus continues to tear through New York City\u2019s jails. The city\u2019s Department of Correction said that 318 detainees, and 562 staff members, have tested positive for Covid-19 as of Saturday morning; two jailed persons have died from the virus. According to the New York Times, seven jail staffers have died due to coronavirus as of Wednesday. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy has issued an executive order requiring face coverings for all customers entering restaurants and bars to pick up carry-out food in the state. Murphy\u2019s order, which goes into effect on Monday at 8pm, comes as New Jersey\u2019s numbers continue to surge with at least 58,151 cases and 2,183 deaths due to Covid-19 \u2013 including 3,599 new positive tests and 251 new fatalities in the last 24 hours \u2013 second only to New York nationally. \u201cSome may view this as another inconvenience,\u201d Murphy said during his daily press briefing on Saturday in Trenton. \u201cBut you know what would be really inconvenient, is if you ended up in hospital with Covid-19 or if you infected a family member. We accept this is inconvenient.\u201d The order also includes a directive for NJ Transit and private carriers to cut all rail and bus capacity by 50% in an effort to curb the spread and for all transit workers to be provided face masks and gloves. Wyoming has become the 50th, and final, US state to be under a disaster declaration following approval by Donald Trump on Saturday. That means for for the first time in history every US state is under a disaster declaration. The US Virgin islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico are also under disaster declarations, which allow federal funds to be used by state and local governments during the pandemic. \u201cThough Wyoming has not reached the dire situations of some states, this declaration will help us to prepare and mobilize resources when we need them,\u201d said Wyoming\u2019s governor, Mark Gordon, in a statement after requesting the declaration earlier this week. There have been 253 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Wyoming to date. Wyoming is the least populated state in the US. So far there have been no deaths from Covid-19 among its 578,000 residents. The US government has executed the Defense Production Act for the law\u2019s first project during the Covid-19 outbreak. The act allows the government to order private industry to assist in the defense of the nation. The $133m project will \u201cincrease domestic production capacity of N95 masks to over 39m in the next 90 days,\u201d according to a government press release. The release said that the companies involved in the project will be released in the coming days. Coronavirus continues to take its toll on the emergency services. The New York Fire Department says that 714 of its members have tested positive for Covid-19 and approximately 2,700 of the department are currently sick or on medical leave. That\u2019s a striking number given that the FDNY has a total of 17,000 members, a number that includes firefighters EMS and civilians. The archbishop of New Orleans, Gregory Aymond, is one of nearly 20,000 residents of Louisiana to have tested positive for Covid-19, so it\u2019s no surprise he took precautions when giving his Good Friday blessing. The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reports that the 70-year-old, who has now recovered from the virus, sprinkled holy water from a second world war-era biplane above the city. \u201cWhen I first did it, the water came back on me,\u201d Aymond said, \u201cbut then I got situated.\u201d He was not the first religious leader to fly above the city this month. Rabbi Lexi Erdheim of the Congregation Gates of Prayer Synagogue in Metairie flew in the same plane as the archbishop to offer a Passover blessing. \u201cIt was really powerful, seeing everything at once,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially after being inside the same four walls for so long.\u201d Aymond said he was cautious at first about flying in a plane that is older than himself. \u201cI asked some questions about the plane,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually my questions became trust.\u201d The US navy dismissed Brett Crozier, the commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, earlier this month after he raised the alarm about an outbreak of coronavirus on his ship. The acting secretary of the US navy, Thomas Modly, subsequently resigned after he said Crozier was \u201ctoo naive or too stupid\u201d to captain the ship. Meanwhile, Crozier\u2019s concerns continue to look justified. CNN reports that 550 of the ship\u2019s sailors have tested positive for Covid-19. Fox News reports that that figure is 75% of the total number of members of the US navy to have tested positive for the virus worldwide. One member of the ship\u2019s crew is understood to be in intensive care in Guam. New Jersey has the second most deaths from Covid-19 of any state in the US. The state\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy, has said customers entering restaurants and bars for takeouts must now wear a facemask, while capacity on public transport will be cut by 50% in an effort to control the outbreak. Murphy said on Saturday that 251 people had died of the virus in New Jersey over the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 2,183 since the outbreak began. Murphy added that he believed measures to slow the spread of the virus are working but there is still work to do. \u201cThe curve is flattening,\u201d he said. [But] we\u2019re not in the end zone folks, we cannot spike any footballs, we\u2019re not even first and goal.\u201d Richard Luscombe has an update from behind the scenes at the White House. A devastating New York Times report published on Saturday chronicles Donald Trump\u2019s repeated failures over several months to take the coronavirus crisis seriously, and how his suspicion of the so-called Deep State \u201ccolored\u201d his tortoise-paced response even as the death toll from Covid-19 began to soar. The newspaper paints a picture of a chronically divided White House, with scientists and medical experts at odds with, and often losing out to, Trump\u2019s political, economic and financial advisers in the battle for the president\u2019s ear. The internal wranglings, the Times says, slowed any clear, consistent or timely decision-making against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s impeachment and trial in the US Senate. \u201cMr Trump\u2019s response was colored by his suspicion of and disdain for what he viewed as the \u2018Deep State\u2019 - the very people in his government whose expertise and long experience might have guided him more quickly toward steps that would slow the virus, and likely save lives,\u201d the report, compiled and written by six New York Times reporters, claims. \u201cThe shortcomings of Mr Trump\u2019s performance have played out with remarkable transparency as part of his daily effort to dominate television screens and the national conversation,\u201d it adds, referring to the president\u2019s rambling and falsehood-ridden press briefings from the White House, which even Republican allies believe are hurting his popularity. The Times article adds more recent detail to the Guardian\u2019s in-depth investigation of Trump\u2019s missing six weeks published two weeks ago. Our reporting found that a botched rollout of testing, the administration\u2019s decision to disband the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s pandemic response team and Trump\u2019s reliance on his own hunches over professional medical advice contributed to the confusion and lack of leadership at a critical moment for the US. Specifically, the Times notes that it was Trump\u2019s fear of, and belief in the existence of a \u2018Deep State\u2019 \u2013 a conspiracy theory dismissed by even his closest allies as \u201cfor nut cases\u201d \u2013 that caused him to ignore warnings from government experts. \u201cHe could have seen what was coming,\u201d the Times headline says. New York governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio once again had differing opinions on who has authority to implement certain Covid-19 policies. This time, it involved De Blasio\u2019s announcement on Saturday morning that New York City schools would remain closed for the rest of the school year. De Blasio said his administration is forging a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to safely reopen schools in September and that \u201cnext year is going to have to be the greatest academic year New York public schools have ever had.\u201d At Cuomo\u2019s daily press briefing shortly thereafter, however, the governor contended \u201cthere has been no decision on [closing New York City] schools.\u201d Cuomo added: \u201cWhen we made the decision to close the schools, we made it for the entire region. Any decision to reopen them will also be a coordinated decision.\u201d Cuomo was then pressed on the topic and De Blasio\u2019s earlier statements. \u201cThat\u2019s his opinion. He didn\u2019t close them and he can\u2019t open them,\u201d Cuomo said \u201cIt happened on a metropolitan-wide basis and we\u2019ll act on a metropolitan basis, coordinating with Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester [counties].\u201d Cuomo insisted school closures and reopenings were his call. \u201cIt is my legal authority in this situation,\u201d he told reporters. Freddi Goldstein, De Blasio\u2019s press secretary, took issue with Cuomo\u2019s comments. \u201cThe Governor\u2019s reaction to us keeping schools closed is reminiscent of how he reacted when the Mayor called for a shelter in place. We were right then and we\u2019re right now,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cSchools will remain closed, just like how we eventually \u2013 days later \u2013 moved to a shelter in place model.\u201d A TV news channel in Mississippi has found a church pastor who says he plans to hold an in-person Easter Sunday service \u2013 in contravention of a mayor\u2019s executive order \u2013 because he\u2019s upset that more people will be at home improvement stores tomorrow than would be permitted in his congregation. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda hard for me to understand why I can only have 10 in a worship service when I go to Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot, and there are more than 10,\u201d Jesse Horton Sr, pastor at Jackson\u2019s Emmanuel Baptist missionary church, told WAPT-TV. \u201cWhy is it that everything else can be open?\u201d Chokwe Antar Lumumba, the mayor of Jackson, has taken a hard line on a coronavirus lockdown, challenging the authority of Tate Reeves, the Mississippi governor, and threatening to cut off electricity to any businesses that defy his instructions. \u201cIf you live in the city of Jackson, you take my executive order,\u201d said Lumumba, who has signed a directive outlawing gatherings of more than 10 people. Conversely, as in many other states, Reeves\u2019 own stay-at-home order appears to exempt religious services at houses of worship. Horton says he plans to press ahead with his Easter service tomorrow, but promises to shut it down if Jackson cops show up to enforce the order. \u201cWe will likely have more than 10. We will be sitting in space. I\u2019m going to say to the congregation, \u2018Let\u2019s be as safe as possible. Let\u2019s not do anything foolish\u2019,\u201d he said. Horton\u2019s is not the only Mississippi church making waves in the debate over religious freedoms during the pandemic. Greenville\u2019s Temple Baptist Church is suing the city government and mayor for breaking up a drive-in service it recently staged, and issuing $500 fines to attendees, according to the Washington Times. The church insists it followed state and federal guidelines and that those who attended remained in their vehicles with windows fully closed, turning into the service on their car radios. \u201cThis is government overreach,\u201d Kristen Waggoner, general counsel of the Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious rights law firm, said in a tweet. \u201cIf [the] government allows waiting in a car at Sonic it should permit a drive-thru Easter service. [The] first amendment is not completely suspended, nor does government have unlimited authority to target churches however they please.\u201d The Greenville mayor Errick Simmons told the newspaper he hadn\u2019t seen the lawsuit but that the city\u2019s actions were to save lives and not intended to restrict religious freedoms. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau says his country faces a \u201cfork in the road\u201d after public health officials revealed a projected death toll between 11,000 and 22,000. \u201cWe will not be coming back to our former normal situation; we can\u2019t do that until we have developed a vaccine and that could take 12 to 18 months,\u201d Trudeau said in an address to the House of Commons in Ottawa. \u201cWe don\u2019t exactly know how long \u2013 we hope it\u2019s earlier rather than later.\u201d He adds: \u201cOver the coming weeks and months, we will face a number of obstacles. We will go through periods of uncertainty. Fear and uncertainty will continue to be a part of our daily lives. And unfortunately, together, we will mourn the loss of loved ones. Even if we take every possible precaution, the situation may get worse before it gets better. That is the sad reality our country faces. Our determination to put an end to this virus and our commitment to look out for one another will be put to the test, but I know that we are up to the challenge.\u201d The US is poised to reach 19,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths \u2013 more than any other country, new data indicates. On Saturday morning, Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally of US Covid-19 fatalities was at 18,860. Italy followed in fatalities, with 18,849. The US was also the first country to report 2,000 deaths in a single day, with 2,108 people dying in the previous 24 hours. The US outbreak, now exceeding a half-million confirmed cases, outpaces Spain, the country with the second-most confirmed cases, by approximately 340,000. \u201cTo the extent it\u2019s flattering I appreciate it,\u201d Cuomo says of the speculation about his running for higher office, before going out of his way to shut it town. \u201cThere is no politics here. I have no political agenda, period. I\u2019m not running for president, I\u2019m not running vice-president. I\u2019m not running anywhere. I\u2019m not going to Washington. I\u2019m staying right here. I said to the people of this state, unequivocally, when I was running for governor, I will serve as your governor. Well they all say that, and then they do something different. \u201cI\u2019m not that person. I am going to do what i said I was going to do.\u201d Cuomo says \u201cthere has been no decision on (closing New York City) schools\u201d, appearing to trump De Blasio\u2019s announcement from earlier this morning, \u201cWhen we made the decision to close the schools, we made it for the entire region,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cAny decision to reopen them will also be a coordinated decision.\u201d When pressed, the governor is more explicit: \u201cThat\u2019s his opinion. He didn\u2019t close them and he can\u2019t open them. It happened on a metropolitan-wide basis and we\u2019ll act on a metropolitan basis, coordinating with Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester (counties).\u201d Cuomo has spent a good deal of time on the weight of the re-opening decision. \u201cRe-opening is both a public health question and an economic question, and I\u2019m unwilling to divorce the two,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cThere is no economic answer that does not attend to public health. In my opinion, you can\u2019t ask the people of this state and this country to choose between lives lost and dollars gained, No one is going to make that quid pro quo. I understand the need to bring back the economy as quickly as possible, I understand people need to work. I also know we need to save lives and we have. One cannot be at the expense of the other.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe worst thing that can happen is we make a misstep and we let our emotions get ahead of logic and fact and we go through this again.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt I have worked hand in glove with the president here,\u201d says Cuomo, who stresses the need to keep politics out of any decision to re-open. \u201c[Trump] has really responded to New York\u2019s needs.\u201d The governor elaborates on the multiple models and forecasters that have projected greater death tolls than what have been realized so far, emphasizing that it\u2019s far too soon to tell when everything will be over and when things can go back to normal. \u201cI say it\u2019s too soon to tell, it\u2019s too soon for Monday morning quarterbacking, because the game isn\u2019t even over yet,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cWhat do you think we\u2019re in, the sixth inning for baseball? You think were at halftime if it\u2019s a football game? You don\u2019t know yet what the actual issue is going to be, and you don\u2019t know yet how this turns out, because many decisions have to be made. You have to re-open, you have to decide how to re-open, you have to decide when to re-open. And that is going to be impactful. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be a second wave or not. All of these things are yet to come, so anyone who wants to say, well, here\u2019s the score at halftime and I\u2019m going to now claim try to collect my bet because it\u2019s halftime, it doesn\u2019t work that way. The game has to be over and this game isn\u2019t over.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo starts with the good news at his daily coronavirus briefing from Albany: \u201cThe curve of the increase is continuing to flatten. The number of hospitalizations appears to have hit an apex and the apex appears to be a plateau.\u201d With the US on the edge of passing Italy as the country with the most coronavirus deaths \u2013 by some counts it already has \u2013 the governor announced 783 deaths in New York on Friday, raising the total to 8,627. Cuomo said the death rate in the state was \u201cstabilizing\u201d but was clear that this is still a terrible outbreak: the death rate was stabilizing \u201cat a horrific rate\u201d, he said, causing \u2018incredible loss and pain\u2019. \u201cPeople ask: well, when is it over, when is it over, when it is over?\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cWinston Churchill said: Now this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end, but it is perhaps the end of the beginning. It\u2019s just a great Churchill quote, it\u2019s precise and how he uses language. I think that\u2019s a fair statement of where we are now.\u201d A federal judge on Friday granted temporary bail to Michael Avenatti after the former Stormy Daniels lawyer voiced coronavirus concerns at the Manhattan federal jail where he was being held. Avenatti was convicted in the Southern District of New York this February of trying to extort sportswear titan Nike. He was arrested in California shortly before this trial for allegedly violating bail, leading to his detention in Manhattan\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center. Avenatti still faces another federal trial in Manhattan, for allegedly defrauding Daniels, as well as a federal fraud trial in California. In arguing for bail, Avenatti\u2019s lawyer said in an 18 March court filing that he is among the \u201cmost-at-risk for contracting Covid-19\u201d both because he is a \u201cdetained prisoner, and therefore far more susceptible to the virus\u201d as well as a recent bout of pneumonia. Central District of California judge James Selna agreed to release Avenatti for 90 days on a $1m bond. Avenatti is also required to be quarantined in a federal Bureau of Prisons facility for 14 days. He must wear a \u201clocation monitoring bracelet\u201d and is not allowed to \u201cpossess, use, or access any digital devices that offer or allow internet access\u201d. Avenatti also is not permitted to \u201copen, either directly or indirectly, any new bank accounts, credit card accounts, or other financial Accounts,\u201d or conduct \u201cany financial transactions exceeding $500\u201d without prior approval, Selna said in his decision. A report from our man in Miami, on Donald Trump\u2019s man in Florida, Republican governor Ron DeSantis, and his uneven response to the coronavirus crisis\u2026 It\u2019s been another bumpy week for Florida\u2019s governor Ron DeSantis, previously criticised for his slow response to the pandemic and now under fire for falsely claiming that nobody under 25 had died of coronavirus. Teachers in South Florida fear that DeSantis\u2019s incorrect statement, made at a roundtable discussion on Thursday, indicated his desire to reopen schools in the state soon. \u201cI don\u2019t think nationwide there\u2019s been a single fatality under 25. For whatever reason it just doesn\u2019t seem to threaten kids,\u201d the governor said, before going on to say such \u201cdata\u201d should be a factor in a decision to reopen schools in two-week increments. The statement was not true. Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious diseases expert, debunked it at Friday\u2019s White House press briefing and warned that students would likely get infected if schools opened too early. DeSantis himself tried to walk back the comment at his own Friday briefing, insisting he had meant nobody under 25 had died in Florida, which is true. But it didn\u2019t save him a dressing-down from the United Teachers of Dade union, which accused the governor of gambling with the health of students and school employees. \u201cThe notion that reopening our schools is an option because \u2018if you\u2019re younger, it just hasn\u2019t had an impact\u2019 is not only completely contradictory to what we know to be the facts of this pandemic, it is dangerous for our communities at large,\u201d union president Karla Mats said in a statement. \u201cIt takes teachers, administrators, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, custodians, and a host of other folks to make sure [schools] function and run accordingly. Many would be placed at great risk through this type of exposure, not to mention their families.\u201d The missteps appear to be taking a toll on DeSantis\u2019s popularity, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In an article on Saturday, the newspaper says support for the governor has plummeted while that for his counterparts in other states has soared, linking to a Microsoft News poll that ranked DeSantis third-worst nationwide at handling the pandemic. De Blasio closes by wishing New Yorkers a happy Easter despite the outbreak and lockdown. \u201cGod bless all New Yorkers in the middle of this incredibly difficult crisis,\u201d he says, leaving the stage. De Blasio is asked about the impact of the coronavirus crisis in the Bronx, the poorest of the five boroughs of New York City. \u201cThere are real disparities in how this crisis is playing out,\u201d he says, citing \u201ca cycle of unfairness that\u2019s playing out very painfully and deeply\u201d. The question focuses on education needs in the Bronx with the New York public schools system shut down until September. Once again \u2013 here\u2019s Ed Pilkington and Ankita Rao\u2019s report about the Bronx and its place within the crisis in New York City: In the New York presser, De Blasio is asked if social distancing guidelines in the city might be tightened further. He would do so if it became necessary, he says. For example he could tighten the definition of what is essential work even further, or limit the number of people who are allowed to do it. But De Blasio adds: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to do theoreticals either way\u201d, referring to being asked to describe how social restrictions might alternatively be loosened. \u201cHere is a plan that New Yorkers are actually making work,\u201d he adds, even though the city is not out of the woods yet. He wants strict enforcement and sustained progress, before talking about \u201csome loosening up\u201d. Our reporter takes a look at grim milestone expected today, and what Donald Trump and federal experts have said about prospects of returning to normalcy: The US was poised on Saturday to reach 19,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths \u2013 more than any other country, new data indicate. The US outbreak, now exceeding a half-million confirmed cases, outpaces Spain, the country with the second-most confirmed cases, by approximately 340,000. On Saturday morning, Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally of US Covid-19 fatalities was at 18,777. Italy continued to lead in fatalities, with 18,849, but the US was also the first country to report 2,000 deaths in a single day, with 2,108 people dying in the previous 24 hours. Researchers at John Hopkins have tallied a total of 501,615 confirmed US cases. Spain follows with 161,852. Italy ranks third, at 147,577. There have been 29,191 reported recoveries in the US, the researchers also said. Worldwide coronavirus deaths now total 103,795. Confirmed cases have reached 1,712,674. Recorded worldwide recoveries total 353,706. The US coronavirus crisis is widely recognized to have been exacerbated by slow federal responses and patchwork state-level approaches. White House expert Dr Deborah Birx has said there are positive signs that the outbreak is stabilising, but warned: \u201cWe have not reached the peak.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US expert on infectious diseases, recently said the US outbreak will approach its end when new infections number almost zero, with the number of deaths close behind. \u201cI believe that in a few months, hopefully, that we\u2019ll get it under control enough that it won\u2019t be as frightening as it is now, but it will not be an absent threat,\u201d Fauci told The New York Times. On MSNBC on Friday, Fauci was asked about the presidential election: \u201cIf you had your way, and I know November to a lot of people seems a long time from now, would people in all 50 states have the right and ability to vote by mail?\u201d Fauci indicated that was not his area of expertise, according to Mediaite, replying: \u201cI would hope that by November we would have things under such control that we could have a real degree of normality. That\u2019s my interest and my job as a public health person.\u201d Questions about normalcy are especially fueled by the stalled US economy, as coronavirus-related business closures and slowdowns have caused 16 million people to lose their jobs. Donald Trump has pushed for a reopening of the economy and reportedly hopes to do so by May. But the president has qualified this hope somewhat, saying at Friday\u2019s press briefing: \u201cI want to get it open as soon as possible \u2026 I would love to open it. I\u2019m not determined.\u201d Trump is expected to next week announce a council of medical and business leaders who will assist him with the \u201cbiggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make\u201d: When to reopen America for business amidst a global pandemic. Health experts have warned that prematurely lifting stay-at-home restrictions could prompt a \u201cdeadly resurgence\u201d of coronavirus. Answering questions from the press, De Blasio says New York can plan to reopen its public school system, the largest in the US, in September as that may be a time when \u201cthings will get more back to normal\u201d in the city. But it isn\u2019t a hard target or a sure one, of course. De Blasio details new moves being taken to protect New York City\u2019s homeless from the coronavirus outbreak. By 20 April, he says, 6,000 single adult New Yorkers who are homeless will have been moved to hotels rather than normal homeless shelters. Those transferred to hotels and afforded isolation conditions will include seniors and those with Covid-19, the mayor says. Here again is Ed Pilkington and Ankita Rao\u2019s piece on coronavirus and the \u201cTwo New Yorks\u201d\u2026 \u201cHaving to tell you that we cannot bring our schools back for the remainder of this school year is painful, but I can also tell you it is the right thing to do,\u201d De Blasio said. He adds that the city will work with parents towards reopening the city\u2019s public schools in September. He says the city will ensure every child who needs an iPad or computer will have one by the end of April, as so many children do not have such devices of their own: De Blasio says 240,000 more will go out. Helplines for parents in multiple languages will be expanded, he says, and a lot more creative at-home programming is coming too. Seniors looking forward to graduating high school will be supported in order to graduate on time \u2013 a full plan will be out next week, the mayor says. De Blasio says his administration is working on a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d for reopening in September in a safe way and in a way that will help disadvantaged students and everyone affected. \u201cNext year is going to have to be the greatest academic year New York public schools have ever had,\u201d De Blasio adds. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that public schools will stay closed for the rest of the academic year. Here\u2019s a link to his press conference: I\u2019m a parent of two children in such schools and one in a pre-school subject to the same rules. So the attempt to teach Spanish at the kitchen table will continue until June. Ah, well. And now, Monty Python-style, the news for giraffes. And for humans seeking good news amid so much bad. The Audobon Nature Institute in New Orleans, a city hit hard by Covid-19, has announced the birth of a giraffe named Hope, to a giraffe named Sue Ellen. \u201cWhat name could be more fitting than \u2018Hope\u2019 in these challenging times?\u201d Audobon president and chief executive Ron Forman told the Associated Press. \u201cHope is what has sustained our community through seemingly insurmountable crises in the past and what we must hold onto as we continue on in the coming days and weeks. May we all take comfort in the reminder that, even in the darkest of days, life continues, undaunted.\u201d The teetering ruminant was born 6ft tall, weighing 189lbs. Like other zoos, aquariums and wildlife parks, the Audubon Nature Institute has been forced to close its facilities to the public during the coronavirus outbreak and, the AP reports, is asking the federal government for funds. Here\u2019s Jonathan Watts on some other heartwarming zoo news: Congressional Republican leaders Mitch McConnell (Senate) and Kevin McCarthy (House) are out with a statement seeking to pressure Democrats over relief efforts for the staggering US economy. The Republicans want a \u201cclean\u201d increase in funding, under the CARES Act stimulus bill passed last month, for the Paycheck Protection Program, which aims to help small businesses. Democrats Chuck Schumer (Senate) and Nancy Pelosi (House) want more money for hospitals and state and local governments. That is of course putting things absurdly simply. Here\u2019s the Republican statement in full, via CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly: Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, hasn\u2019t announced the time for his daily briefing yet but usually they come along around 11am ET, an hour or so from now. Cuomo\u2019s handling of the crisis in the worst-hit US state has been generally praised, even to the extent of insistent reports that some Democrats would like him to replace Joe Biden as the party\u2019s likely nominee to face Donald Trump in November. For what it\u2019s worth, Cuomo has flatly denied any interest in that. (And done so to his brother, Chris Cuomo, a CNN anchor who has coronavirus himself.) Here\u2019s the New York Times on how Cuomo and Biden get along. On Friday, meanwhile, Governor Cuomo did what a lot of US politicians like to do and quoted Winston Churchill: Churchill quotes are notoriously tricky things, because he often didn\u2019t say what most people now believe he did. Cuomo, at least, is on safe ground here: it\u2019s from a speech on 10 November 1942, after Britain had managed a victory over Nazi Germany, at El Alamein, but when as it would turn out there were nearly three years left to fight. The New York numbers again, according to Johns Hopkins: 174,489 cases 7,887 deaths And here\u2019s Ed Pilkington and Ankita Rao\u2019s devastating piece on how when it comes to the coronavirus there are two New York Cities, with drastically different experiences: The coronavirus outbreak has ravaged the US economy and pitched hundreds of thousands of households into peril, without paychecks and with even food supply uncertain. From Texas, a stunning story and images from the San Antonio Express-News: In perhaps the most sobering reminder yet of the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the San Antonio Food Bank aided about 10,000 households Thursday in a record-setting giveaway at a South Side flea market. \u201cIt was a rough one today,\u201d said Food Bank president and CEO Eric Cooper after the largest single-day distribution in the nonprofit\u2019s 40-year history. \u201cWe have never executed on as large of a demand as we are now.\u201d Thursday\u2019s drive-thru at Traders Village was the fourth such event for the Food Bank since 31 March \u2026 about 6,000 households preregistered for Thursday\u2019s distribution on the Food Bank\u2019s website, Cooper said. But thousands more showed up, hoping to put something on their tables. Here\u2019s a screengrab of the front page of the paper: Here, meanwhile, is Adam Gabbatt\u2019s recent report about what the coronavirus crisis means for local papers such as the Express-News. It\u2019s not good, as Penny Abernathy, Knight chair in journalism and digital media economics at the University of North Carolina, predicts a swath of newspaper and website closures. \u201cI think there\u2019ll be hundreds, not dozens,\u201d Abernathy said. \u201cAn extinction-level event will probably hit the smaller ones really hard, as well as the ones that are part of the huge chains.\u201d A worrying report from the Associated Press, about how the coronavirus is affecting the Navajo Nation, about whose attempts to tackle the outbreak Nina Lakhani reported earlier this month: Two leaders of the largest Native American reservation in the US are in self-quarantine as the Navajo Nation prepares for a weekend-long curfew aimed at curbing the coronavirus outbreak. The virus has swept with ferocity through the Navajo Nation, a 27,000-square-mile reservation which spans parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The tribe has recorded nearly 600 cases and 22 deaths. Navajo president Jonathan Nez and vice-president Myron Lizer are quarantining themselves as a precaution after being in close proximity with a first responder who later tested positive. They say they donned masks and gloves while visiting communities and are following protocols to isolate. Their decision came as the tribe prepared for the 57-hour reservation-wide curfew that began Friday at 8pm. Strict enforcement has been promised, with Navajo police able to issue citations that may include fines up to $1,000 or jail time. \u201cWith the number of positive cases rising, it\u2019s imperative that we make smart decisions to protect the ones we love,\u201d Nez said on Friday. \u201cPlease think of our grandmothers and grandfathers and those with underlying conditions. Let us also remember that we \u2026 are strong, our ancestors overcame many atrocities, for us to be here today \u2013 let\u2019s honor their sacrifices by making good decisions.\u201d Access to healthcare and medical supplies is a concern on the Navajo Nation and in other tribal communities in the south-western US that have seen spikes in the number of cases over the past week. A philanthropic effort announced by former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson is the latest aimed at getting more supplies to the Navajo Nation. The national guard in Arizona and New Mexico have helped. Former Navajo president and chairman Peterson Zah said his community had resorted to curfews appropriately to avoid panic but the reaction to the first faraway US coronavirus outbreaks was too gradual. \u201cIt\u2019s like rain,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re way out in the desert, like on the Navajo Nation, and you look out during the summer and you know that the rain is coming because the clouds are billowing up and you\u2019ve got to prepare. People started running around when it started raining. Before the rain came, we should have been all in sync with one another.\u201d Here\u2019s Nina\u2019s report in full: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/02/navajo-nation-grassroots-self-help-coronavirus \u2026 and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. Sobering news this Saturday morning, as researchers at Johns Hopkins University put the US on course to overtake Italy as the country with the most confirmed Covid-19 deaths, with nearly 19,000, after recording more than 2,000 deaths in one day. By Johns Hopkins\u2019 count there have been more than 102,000 deaths worldwide, 18,849 of them in Italy. The same count says there have been more than 500,000 cases confirmed in the US, with New York at nearly 175,000 cases and nearly 8,000 deaths. In New York on Friday, Governor Andrew Cuomo reported a leap of more than 700 deaths, but also reported that hospitalisations are remaining relatively flat. New Jersey has recorded nearly 2,000 deaths and Michigan nearly 1,300. At the White House on Friday, task force member Dr Deborah Birx said that despite encouraging signs that the outbreak in the US is beginning to level off, \u201cWe have not reached the peak.\u201d Here\u2019s our interactive map, based on those Johns Hopkins figures: At the same White House briefing, Donald Trump mused further about the need to reopen the US economy, although he did indicate he would defer to experts including Dr Birx as the end of current federal social distancing guidelines, on 30 April, draws near. Here\u2019s Washington bureau chief David Smith\u2019s report. There is no coronavirus taskforce briefing on the White House schedule today. Of course, that can change if the president decides he wants to talk to the press \u2013 and chase his precious ratings, particularly as his polling numbers drop. He did so last Sunday. Debate continues in the US over whether major broadcasters and news outlets should carry the briefings, at which the president is somewhat prone to make misleading claims, attack journalists and indulge in rather naked electioneering. More to come \u2013 in the meantime here\u2019s David Smith again, with a look at the symbiotic relationship between Trump and Fox News, and how it has shaped America\u2019s Covid-19 response:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
