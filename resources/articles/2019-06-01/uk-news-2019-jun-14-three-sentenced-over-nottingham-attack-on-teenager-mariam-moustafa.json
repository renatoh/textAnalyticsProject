Mariam Moustafa, 18, had a stroke shortly after being punched and slammed into a bus stop outside a shopping centre in February last year and died a month later. Six women were charged with affray after a police investigation found no link between the attack and the stroke. Mariah Fraser, 20, Britania Hunter, 18, and a 16-year-old girl who cannot be named were among a group of young women who confronted Moustafa over a boy in a violent episode fuelled by social media. Fraser\u2019s previous convictions were read out at Nottingham crown court on Friday, and included robbery, attempted robbery and assaulting a police officer. Hunter was given a 12-month community order and told to do 40 hours\u2019 unpaid work, and the 16-year-old girl was remitted back to youth court with a view to a referral order. The judge, Gregory Dickinson QC, described the defendants as aggressive and cowardly, but said: \u201cThis was not an attack motivated by hostility to race or religion. It was to do with a boy.\u201d He also defended his decision to spare two of the defendants prison. \u201cThe family of Mariam want the maximum possible sentence to be imposed on all those involved in the case,\u201d he said. \u201cSympathy for their desperate sadness cannot displace a proper, dispassionate approach to sentencing in a court of law. \u201cIt is important that everyone with an interest in this sad case should understand that the three defendants are to be dealt with for the offence of affray. They were not charged with murder or manslaughter. They are to be sentenced on the basis that their actions, individually and collectively, did not cause the death of Mariam Moustafa. \u201cThe conclusion was that it could not be proved that there was a causative link between the actions of the defendants and the stroke.\u201d Moustafa was punched several times during the attack near a bus stop in Parliament Street, while her friend Pablo Jawara tried to protect her. Fraser, Hunter and the 16-year-old girl all admitted affray a week before their trial was due to start. Three other teenagers aged 18, 17 and 16 will be sentenced later this month. Opening the facts of the case on Thursday, the prosecutor Luke Blackburn said the six defendants were not charged with manslaughter because pathologists could not \u201clegally link\u201d the attack and her death. The court heard how two of the six, a 16-year-old and an 18-year-old, were the main aggressors in the altercation, while the others either filmed the incident or watched events unfold. Speaking directly to Fraser, the judge said: \u201cYou used violence. You contributed significantly to the overall seriousness of the affray. It is not correct to say that you were on the periphery, as was submitted on your behalf. In my judgment your role as a part of the incident as a whole, with your record of convictions, means that a custodial sentence is necessary. \u201cIt was a serious incident, with six involved, filmed in part, in view of numerous members of the public. At its core, the cowardly and unnecessary targeting of one young woman.\u201d Moustafa was born in Rome, to where her family had moved from Egypt in 1991. She had been offered a place at university in London. Italian prosecutors have opened an investigation into her death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
