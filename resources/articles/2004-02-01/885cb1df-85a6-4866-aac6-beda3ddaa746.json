Top-Up TV, formed by former BSkyB supremos David Chance and Ian West, today formally complained to Ofcom after days of negotiations over where the new channels would be electronically listed came to nothing. The new firm, which had planned to go live by the end of next month, now fears the launch of the new service could be delayed by the latest row. The BBC is concerned that Top-Up TV will confuse consumers attracted by the simplicity of Freeview, which offers 33 channels for a one-off fee of as little as \u00a369, and has moved to block any integration of the two services. At a digital television conference in October last year, the BBC's director of strategy and distribution, Carolyn Fairburn, said a pay-TV option would confuse consumers and throw \"a spanner in the works\". \"Our view is that this could stop Freeview in its tracks after we've only just managed to cut through the confusion,\" she said. Top-Up TV is understood to have argued that both satellite and cable TV merge free to air and paid-for channels in their electronic programme listings, grouping all entertainment channels together, all sports channels together and so on. The new venture has argued in its complaint that the BBC was present at a meeting last September when it was agreed that the EPG would follow a genre-based approach. This would be crucial in publicising the new service because Freeview customers, of which there will be 3 million by the end of next month, would see the new channels next to their existing ones and be alerted to the existence of Top-Up TV. \"It is only in the last 10 days that the BBC has raised its objections. It's trying to banish the channels to the digital ether and anyone in multichannel knows how vital the EPG is,\" said one source close to the negotiations. It is believed that ITV, Channel 4, Channel Five and Crown Castle, the transmission business that launched Freeview in conjunction with the BBC, have no objection to Top-Up TV's plans. They have also pointed to the fact that when BSkyB threatened to move the BBC channels from their position at the top of the EPG during a bitter row over encryption payments last year, the corporation argued that they should remain where they are. The new service offers viewers with an old ITV Digital box 10 free-to-air channels for \u00a37.99 a month plus a \u00a320 installation charge, undercutting the cheapest packages offered by Sky and its cable rivals, NTL and Telewest. Although initially only viewers with an ITV Digital box will be able to receive the service, the company plans to issue upgraded set-top boxes or add-on devices that would enable anyone with Freeview to pick up the channels. It will offer subscribers some of the most popular digital channels, including UK Gold, E4, Cartoon Network, Discovery, UK Style, Bloomberg, Discovery Home and Leisure and Turner Classic Movies. Controversially the new service will also offer the Fantasy Channel, a soft porn broadcaster owned by Richard Desmond. Using digital space leased from S4C and NTL joint venture SDN and ITV, the new channels will share slots on the digital terrestrial network with, for example, one of the children's channels broadcast during the day before handing over to a movie channel in the evening. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
