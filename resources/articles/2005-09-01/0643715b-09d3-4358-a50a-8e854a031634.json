The skies are looking apocalyptic over London, so this might not last long. Indeed, the umpires are already debating whether to offer Australia the light. 3.30pm: The light is offered ... and Langer and Hayden have accepted! Wouldn't it be funny if this cost them the Ashes on Monday night? \"I am 'working' at The Oval,\" writes my boss Emily Bell, via Blackberry. \"I would like to report that I have been given directions by Ian Botham, met Richie Benaud and can confirm that the Channel 4 commentary team eat Maynards wine gums.\" So now you know. 3.40pm: Umpire Koertzen is explaining why he offered Australia the light. Umpire Billy Bowden follows up by pointing out that \"it has to be fair contest between bat and ball, and Australia have every right to walk off the pitch.\" The skies are darkening by the minute, and thunder can be heard across London. 3.45pm: It's not raining at the Oval yet, but the covers are on. \"Is the Guardian's Australian viewpoint, Gideon Haigh, the same Gideon Haigh who went totally ballistic with joy in Adelaide in 1995 when England beat Australia?\" asks Billy Cotton. \"I have this all on video as at the precise moment when we took the last wicket, he was filming the moment for a behind the scenes feature on the tour.\" Yep, it the same Gideon Haigh, Billy. He's English by birth, but moved to Australia when he was a nipper. 3.50pm: Just in case you didn't believe my comments re: the London weather, here's Martin Dow. \"I can report that the view from the 24th floor in the City of London this afternoon is glorious: thick, black cloud and lightning rolling over south London... enough to bring a tear to the eye,\" he sobs. 3.55pm: Despite reports of torrential rain across London, it's still dry at the Oval. Meanwhile this from Jenny Woodhams. \"Please can you settle the raging debate that's started in our office - could the Test go to a sixth day if rain delays play? No one here seems to know for certain.\" Nope, Jenny, the match has to finish on Monday. However play can be extended during the next three days to make up the overs lost due to bad weather. 4pm: Amazingly, while emailers in Putney and Wandsworth talk of \"end-of-the-world-is-nigh\" rain and gale force winds, the covers are coming off at the Oval. Which makes Rich Holman's gag a bit redundant. \"It seems natural to me that the weather should come to the rescue of England,\" he chuckles. \"It's been by far our best performer for years.\" 4.05pm: For a moment it looks like we're going to get some play, as England's players leave their dressing room - only for umpire Bowden to send them back. \"I reckon you should have lied over the sixth day,\" says Anthony Wesselbaum. \"Serves them right for jumping on the bandwagon and not doing any work. Skiving during Test matches should be the preserve of true fans.\" 4.15pm: Apparently we were about to restart a few minutes ago, but then the umpires took another light reading which revealed the light had \"got considerably worse\". Meanwhile this from Bill Rogers. \" Just wondering what sort of office does Jenny (3.55pm) work in where no one knows how long a Test match lasts?\" he writes. \"Does she work for Cosmo or Marie Claire?\" 4.25pm: It's still not raining at the Oval, which means the Aussies have lost an hour's play. \"I can also report that it is raining in Victoria and Balham,\" says Sian Jones who seems to be in two places at once. \"What we need is some weather control to ensure the rain reaches the Oval. Where's Paul McCartney when you need him? If he zapped a few clouds for a stupid concert he can certainly do the same when there is sporting glory at stake.\" 4.35pm: It's brightening up again, which makes Ben Mimmack's email all the more relevant. \"According to wikipedia, silver iodide flares released from the ground may increase the amount of precipitation that falls from existing cloud cover,\" he writes. \"Might I suggest that everyone around the oval should nip round to the local silver iodide flare shop and buy as many as they can before setting them all off.\" 4.42pm: The Oval skies are definitely lighter and, from what umpire Koertzen said earlier, the Australians could ask to come back on. There's no sign of it happening yet, mind. \"Why do Anthony Wesselbaum and others get snippy about people who have become interested in cricket during this Ashes series?\" fumes Emma Porritt. \"I am a proud bandwagon-jumper: I watch cricket for Test matches, football for the World Cup, track and field in the Olympics, tennis for Wimbledon, golf for the Ryder Cup and rugby for the six nations. I don't see why this is offensive, do you?\" 4.46pm: Still no sign of play. \"Great idea re: silver iodide flares,\" writes Daniel Dempsey. \"Just don't take the tube, the police round that part of south London are a little twitchy and a load of us setting of flares might be too much for them.\" 4.52pm: Good news for England fans: more covers are coming on. Meanwhile this from Alice Wignall. \"Re: Bill Rogers' rather dismissive assumption that the staff of womens' magazines know nothing about cricket. I'd like to point out that here at New Woman there's a small group of us who, since yesterday morning, have scarcely paid any attention to what the must-have new shade of nail varnish for autumn is, such is our dedication to following the OBO coverage. We also understand LBW, in case you're wondering. Yes, even the bit about pitching outside leg. So there. PS it's raining in Covent Garden as of a few seconds ago.\" 4.56pm: Rain has started to fall, but it's light drizzle at most. And the light isn't bad either. So the Aussies could certainly bat in this. Meanwhile this from Channel 4's Louise Peake. \"My sister in Perth, WA, has told me that school kids are starting to use the phrase 'Nice one, Shane' as a response to anything good,\" she writes. \"Stump mics are a wonderful thing.\" 5pm: The drizzle has stopped. \"Clearly, what's required is for David Gower to fly over in a Tiger Moth crop-duster, and sprinkle silver iodide across the skies above The Oval,\" suggests Alex Holland, not unreasonably. 5.05pm: No news. \"Emma Porritt (4.42pm) has no need to fume. She's not breaking either of the rules of band-wagon-jumping,\" says Dan Roberts. 1) She doesn't jump on every bandwagon and love everything, regardless of it's quality - a la Jo Whiley, and 2) She is comfortable with what she is and doesn't pretend she's a lifelong die-hard fan, perhaps showing some appreciation our years of dedication and suffering.\" 5.10pm: Latest odds: England 15-2, Australia 6-4, draw evens. \"I'm not sure who the England player is in your photograph of umpire Koertzen but he is to be commended,\" says Peter Sadler. \"It appears that he has sidled up and leaned his sun hat towards the light meter, thereby reducing the reading and ensuring a chance for a rest and a brew. Could this be the pivotal moment of this year's Ashes?\" 5.18pm: Still no sign of play. There's little wind, and I'm guessing that it'll be it for the night. Remember England were all out for 373, with Australia on 112-0. \"I bet David Shepherd is glad they nicked that last single before tea. He'd have fallen over by now for sure,\" says David Smale. 5.25pm: It's raining at the Oval, which is now three-quarters empty. It's only a matter of time before the umpires call play off for the day. However we can make up half an hour a day, so the Aussies will still feel reasonably confident they can force a result. \"I reckon Australia are screwed,\" says Nick Warbuton. \"You know what it's like in this country. You sit all day in the office with the sun beaming outside and soon as it hits 5pm on a Friday and you look forward to a weekend of great weather, the rain comes down and the break from work is a washout. That leaves the Australians only Monday from roughly 9pm to do something.\" Let's hope so, Nick. Cheers for all your emails and goodnight, Sean."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
