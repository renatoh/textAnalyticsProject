The vision is more ambitious than ever before. FE colleges are leaders in their community. Not just in education, but as institutions that can drive economic development and regeneration through their presence, participation and leadership. Their role in the community is exemplified by teaching English as a second language - where the challenge is to reach those who may have lived in this country for many years and yet lack the English language skills to participate in our society - and by initial learning, which gives people the skills and confidence to take part in society and work. Far from a single-minded obsession with vocational qualifications, colleges deliver the great majority of the \u00a31.5bn spent on learning below level 2. And I have no doubt that, when we complete our review of informal adult learning, a clear role will remain for colleges. But we know changes are needed in the way some learning is delivered. Too many gaps remain between the support provided by Jobcentre Plus and that provided by colleges. So we are asking colleges to work closely with employment services. Colleges will also be key in the new advancement and careers service - the aim of which is to guide adults through the skills, benefits, housing and childcare system to find better jobs. The creation of the Department for Children, Schools and Families places even greater responsibility on colleges to help develop a coherent education system through the introduction of diplomas and expanding apprenticeships. We will also ensure that other parts of colleges' work are increasingly demand-led. By expanding Train to Gain and developing personal skills accounts, we will give more influence to both employers and learners. There will be a premium on the ability of colleges to respond to their needs, rather than respond to a central commissioning agency. This approach is essential in a fast-changing world. More and more jobs require specialised skills, and colleges must be part of dealing with that challenge. So we will increase investment. Let's not forget that in 1997 not one penny of government money was available to build anything in FE. By 2010, we will have invested about \u00a35bn. This is a huge range of responsibilities. The coherent thread through it all is that we cannot deliver a system enabling millions to fulfil their potential without institutions capable of providing such a breadth of learning. Without FE colleges we will not bring about the sharp improvement in skills needed by our economy and public services. Not every college will offer all parts of this agenda, but many will. It is for colleges to decide how their strengths can best meet their community's needs. This diversity is its enduring strength. In the recent scenario planning exercise, which involved nearly every English college, it was the sheer diversity of this challenge that came through most strongly. Some of the activities of colleges can be measured and reflected in targets. Others are not so easy to measure but are still a key part of the colleges' role. If ever there was a time when a college said \"tell us what to do and we'll do it\", those days are gone. College leaders need the ability to guide their institutions through complex worlds - with the responsibility to support degree students and those with no literacy; the confidence to support an A-level student heading for Oxbridge and help vulnerable people back into education. The biggest sign of government's confidence in FE is our belief that college leaders can meet this challenge. We'll support them with increased investment in adult skills and funding for young people, and through investment in buildings and equipment. And as we move to a less prescriptive, lighter approach to skills funding, we will back their desire for increased responsibility and autonomy. \u00b7 John Denham is secretary of state for innovation, universities and skills"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
