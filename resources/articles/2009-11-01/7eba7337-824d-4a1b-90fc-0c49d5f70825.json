I think Moli\u00e8re understood that. His play \u2013 translated here by Roger McGough \u2013 is about a fit and wealthy middle-aged man, Argan, who thinks he's at death's door. His doctors collude in his hypochondriasis to fleece him of his money. There's plenty of slapstick and toilet humour in the play: I particularly liked McGough rhyming \"medical thesis\" with \"faeces\". I've known plenty of people like Argan. We call them \"heart-sink patients\", because you see them and think: \"Oh God, not them again.\" For some people, seeing a doctor is their only means of interacting with the world. You have to negotiate a dose of doctoring just to keep them going. But you do find yourself making ludicrous suggestions out of desperation \u2013 like one of Argan's doctors who tells him to try doing a little dance. The doctors in the play are portrayed as arrogant, cruel, money-grabbing, petulant, dim and socially inept. OK, you do get the odd arrogant, scalpel-throwing surgeon, and some people might say GPs are money-grabbing, but people don't realise how complicated our funding situation is. I might have been offended by these caricatures if I worked in the private sector, where there's a temptation to offer unneeded treatment. I see patients coming back from America or Europe, where they have a private fee system for GPs, excited because they think they've had great treatment. I just think: \"They wanted your money.\" Politicians want doctors to make it easier for people to get appointments. They should see this play. We get a lot of time-wasters: people coming to ask us how to deal with their family, or whether they should get a dog. Politicians should realise that making it easier to see the doctor can prove counterproductive for patients who really need to just get a life. \u2022 Interview by Laura Barnett. David Fair is a GP with Jorvik medical practice, York. The Hypochondriac is at New Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich (01473 295-900), from tomorrow to Saturday. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
