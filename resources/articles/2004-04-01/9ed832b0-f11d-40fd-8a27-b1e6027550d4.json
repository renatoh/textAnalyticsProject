This is a key staging post en route to Greece. For years the track World Cup has been a Cinderella event, but this year it matters in terms of qualification for slots in the summer games through the world championships. Hence the focus for the British squad as they attempt to win medals in eight events in Athens following the pleasant surprise of Sydney - where Jason Queally won gold in the kilometre and there were other medals in the team pursuit, women's pursuit and Olympic sprint. \"We are looking for strong performances in the World Cup, so we need a totally professional performance, but it's also an invaluable dress rehearsal with the pressure of a home crowd for the riders and particularly the staff,\" said Britain's performance director Dave Brailsford. He is using the weekend as a chance to experiment with team line-ups in two of the British squad's strongest disciplines, tonight's team pursuit and tomorrow's Olympic sprint, where his riders have not been out of the medals at world championships since the Sydney Olympics. The squad for the Olympic sprint, where three riders are chosen from a possible four for a three-lap relay, will be reshuffled in an attempt to find the perfect combination of speed, strength and stamina for Athens. Another area in which the British team is ringing the changes is in today's 4,000m men's team pursuit, where the time-trial world champion David Millar will be part of an experimental line-up along with Rob Hayles, Chris Newton and Bryan Steel, who is attempting to gain experience of world-class track competition before tackling the individual event in Athens. \"It would be a lot of pressure for Dave to ride the individual event, and we want him to do more this weekend than stand around watching, so this is the ideal compromise,\" said Brailsford. In yesterday's early action, the Commonwealth Games champion Bradley McGee of Australia laid down an early marker in the men's 4,000m individual pursuit, posting a fastest qualifying time of 4min 21.125sec, four seconds faster than the second qualifier Sergi Escobar of Spain, with Britain's Paul Manning in third place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
