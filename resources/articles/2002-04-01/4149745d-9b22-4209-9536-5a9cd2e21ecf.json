The move came as the mayor of London Ken Livingstone wrote to the Football Association to express his concern about possible travel chaos around the match between Arsenal and Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium. But there was worse news for those fans wanting to stagger the return journey by travelling back on the Sunday. Railtrack said on May 5 London Paddington station would be closed for essential resignalling work and trains would terminate at Ealing Broadway. Railtrack added that it had suspended all engineering works along the route to south Wales for May 12 but the date of the final had been changed by the FA. On the day of the final, Railtrack said train operators will provide additional services to ensure two trains per hour from London to Cardiff operated instead of the normal one per hour. Five additional charter trains will also run. In his letter to the FA chief executive Adam Crozier, Livingstone set out his concern that the lengthy delays suffered by many fans after Sunday's FA Cup semi-finals at Old Trafford and Villa Park could be repeated on the M4 on May 4. The Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock insists he had no choice other than to let half a dozen of his experienced first-team players go. The Blades boss will not be renewing the contracts of strikers Laurent D'Jaffo and Mark Ward, midfield men Bobby Ford, Adam Burley and Georges Santos and defender Gus Uhlenbeek, currently on loan at Walsall. \u00b7 Atletico Madrid's chairman Jesus Gil was remanded in custody by a Spanish high court judge yesterday as part of a corruption investigation. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
