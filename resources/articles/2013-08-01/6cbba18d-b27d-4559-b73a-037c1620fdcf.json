But starting some 30 years after his death, his fiction has reached a larger audience as a source of screenplays. Immediately after the second world war The Aspern Papers, shot in Hollywood on stylised Venetian sets, became the underrated The Lost Moment (the only film directed by the actor Martin Gabel) and was followed by William Wyler's highly regarded The Heiress (a version of Washington Square). Since then there have been a dozen or more James movies, adapting such complex books as The Golden Bowl, The Portrait of a Lady and The Wings of the Dove, and \"the Master\" has attracted film-makers as different as Truffaut, whose The Green Room is an updating of The Altar of the Dead, and Michael Winner. The latter studied at Downing College, Cambridge when FR Leavis, one of James's greatest champions, taught there, and Winner directed Marlon Brando in The Nightcomers, a prequel to The Turn of the Screw. In the early 1990s Louis Malle gave up on a modernised adaptation of James's 1897 novel What Maisie Knew, which might well have proved a fascinating companion piece to his Zazie dans le m\u00e9tro. The American team of Scott McGehee and David Siegel, working from a screenplay by Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright, have succeeded where Malle failed, and their Maisie is both an attractive film in its own right and a fascinating commentary on changing times and mores. James's story is set in late Victorian England and centres on the broken marriage of a middle-class couple, Ida and Beale, she an idle, immoral society beauty, he an indolent retired diplomat, who are given joint custody of their six-year-old daughter Maisie. This was a new and controversial subject, and What Maisie Knew is among the first novels to deal with the effects of divorce on a child. Both parents remarry. Beale's new wife is a genteel but wilful former nurse of Maisie's. Ida's new husband is the feckless, charming aristocrat, Sir Claude. Both the nurse and Sir Claude become closer to Maisie than her real parents are, and eventually they marry each other after Ida and Beale once again go their own ways. James's biographer, Leon Edel, acutely observed: \"In the depths of this novel \u2013 which on the surface is very much like a French bedroom farce translated into an English environment \u2013 we can discern James's own confusion before the collapsing late Victorian moral facade.\" The novel is written as James was moving into the complex, ironic, convoluted style that resulted from dictating his work to a shorthand typist. Maisie is written in the third person but looks at the world from the child's point of view. In the McGehee-Siegel film the setting is present-day New York, a place where divorce goes hand in clammy hand with marriage, and the parents become the ageing American rock star Susanna (Julianne Moore) and her British art dealer husband Beale (Steve Coogan). They're as selfish and shallow as the pair in the novel, and because of their language they can seem even more vindictive. But unlike the Victorian equivalents, they are hard, dedicated workers with plausible excuses for neglecting Maisie. The other, younger couple, the step-parents, become Margo (Joanna Vanderham) and Lincoln (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd). Margo is sweet-natured, kindly and, from her accent, Scottish. Lincoln's a handsome, considerate, gentle bartender with a soft Swedish lilt, working in a fashionable restaurant, but with an attitude to material possessions that would make him an unlikely patron of such a place. Between these two pairs young Maisie (Onata Aprile) bounces back and fourth like a pinball, a delightful, unaffected presence, and immensely expressive. But we miss James's subtly observant prose, both to guide us and to articulate what a child can only perceive. She is in every scene, and the camera is placed near the ground at Maisie's eye level. The adults are often cut off just above her head or seen from below. She listens, eavesdrops, takes things in, while being seduced, manipulated and lied to by both parents in their contrasted ways. The driven, desperate Susanna is more direct than the detached, humorous Beale. \"Your dad's an asshole,\" she says. When Maisie talks admiringly of Susanna being on \"a big tour\" with her band, Beale observes: \"Not so big, I hear.\" The film takes place over a much shorter time than the book, Maisie doesn't change physically, and this story isn't about, as James puts it in his preface, \"the death of childhood\". In earlier films \u2013 the postmodern, philosophical noir mystery Suture; the psychological thriller Deep End (based on the same novel as Max Ophuls's The Reckless Moment); Bee Season, a study of tensions within an ambitious academic family \u2013 McGehee and Siegel have shown an understanding of the ambiguities of identity and the complexities of family life. In What Maisie Knew they're working with a somewhat lighter touch, though underlying the relationship between the neurotic Susanna and the nonchalant Beale there are elements of the tragic, and this is brought out in the excellent performances of Moore and Coogan. What of course is always missing is the authorial voice, the eloquence and nuance that inheres in the texture of the novel's prose. This accomplished film is closer to Kramer vs Kramer or middle-period Woody Allen than it is to James. But that is no bad place to be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
