At the higher figure of 550ppm, there is only a 30%-70% chance of exceeding 3C and a 24% chance of 4C. This must surely be unacceptably high risk. It is the tragedy of 30 years of green politics that the electoral system and the necessity of party patronage to the Lords has worked to exclude green voices from parliament. Therefore, I nominate Monbiot for a peerage. To spare his blushes, perhaps other readers might help create a radical new year list for Prime Minister Brown to consider. Peter Hack Bristol Your leader (Green energy, December 29) is muddled. Yes, it is good that the new solar converter panels promise to be more efficient and cheaper than the existing ones. But \"suddenly the optimism of solar electricity becoming as cheap as coal power looks plausible\"? Really? In the UK? To heat homes on a winter's night? The most effective use of the new technology will undoubtedly be to power air conditioners worldwide and especially in the US. But even if the early promise is confirmed, the most likely benefits to the UK will be indirect. Large solar power plants situated in southern EU states or in north Africa could be economic generators of electricity or hydrogen, both of which could be fed to the UK. Of course the UK should foster non-global-warming power sources, but it will do best to concentrate on those that are indigenous or easily available.
