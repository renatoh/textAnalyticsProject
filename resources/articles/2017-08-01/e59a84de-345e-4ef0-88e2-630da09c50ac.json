We told government many times about this problem.\u201d Lewis, a Warlpiri woman who has lived her whole life in Lajamanu, has three generations living in her house, including her husband, two sons, one daughter-in-law, and her granddaughter. It\u2019s above the average for Lajamanu, a central desert community of about 600 people which, according to the 2016 census, has an average of 4.5 occupants per household \u2013 one of the Northern Territory\u2019s highest rates. Lajamanu dwellings have an average 2.9 rooms. Nationally, there are 2.6 people sharing 3.1 rooms in each household. \u201cEveryone was living in overcrowded houses, and we\u2019re not happy. I supposed that\u2019s everywhere, in other communities as well. That\u2019s the biggest issue in every Aboriginal community,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cThe government or whoever is not listening to us. It looks like we\u2019re begging them for new houses. This is our own land, we are the first people of Australia, and they don\u2019t look at it, they just treat us as dirt.\u201d The median family income in Lajamanu is $612 a week, a little more than a third of the national figure, and what Lewis describes as \u201cpeanut money\u201d. Unemployment is high but engagement with Centrelink is comparatively low. Most homes are public housing. \u201cWe are begging government for work, for housing, we\u2019re begging and begging,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cMost of our people passed away now. It\u2019s us mob fighting. When are the government mob going to understand?\u201d The community, which is 90% Indigenous, is one of many to be dealing with overcrowding. A Guardian Australia analysis of census data, using the variables of average household size and persons per bedroom as indicators, suggests improvements in the levels of Indigenous overcrowding at a national level since 2006. The analysis found as the Indigenous proportion of the population rises, so too does average household size and persons per bedroom. That trend has become less pronounced since the 2006 census. The analysis suggests that overcrowding in Indigenous communities is more likely than in non-Indigenous communities. Census data also shows that Indigenous people are more likely to live in a house with three or more people and are more than twice as likely to live in a house with six, seven or eight people. Georgina McLeod has lived in Kalkarindji for more than 30 years, where the census showed an average of 4.7 people in each dwelling and 1.8 in each room. McLeod says the reality is different and some houses have four or five families, each one living in a single room. \u201cThey have their fridge in their bedroom because that\u2019s the only way they can keep their food safe from anyone else who may be in the house. Then that\u2019s not safe because someone hungry comes along and breaks into that room.\u201d She says while some new public housing is under construction, there hasn\u2019t been much in the past 10 years except for accommodation for government workers, teachers, and the like. McLeod said the lack of new buildings for Indigenous residents has affected community morale. Overcrowding is a widely cited factor at the heart of Indigenous disadvantage indicators, including health, safety and education. Diseases such as scabies are rife in many Northern Territory remote Indigenous communities, with a 2008 studying finding up to 70% of babies infected before their first birthday in some regions. In the 10 years since the United Nations expert on housing declared a \u201ccrisis\u201d in Indigenous housing in the NT, two major reports have also highlighted the need for improvements, particularly to address child protection issues. It was also frequently raised during the royal commission into the protection and detention of children. McLeod in Kalkarindji says overcrowding impacts everything \u201cfrom kids attendance at school, domestic violence, violence in general\u201d. \u201cAnd the cleanliness of the house \u2013 no one takes ownership of the house because they can\u2019t. If one person tries to instil their rules on how to clean or wipe down the bench, that ends up in blows. Certainly the level of violence in communities I would absolutely [connect with overcrowding]. And depression, mental health, education and health in general. There simply needs to be more housing.\u201d Homelessness Australia says there is currently a shortage of more than 20,000 properties across Australia \u201cthat are affordable and appropriate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\u201d. \u201cThe shortage of larger, culturally appropriate houses that can accommodate kin and increasingly children in kinship care arrangements means that high numbers of Aboriginal people are in severely overcrowded households.\u201d In other words, remote living Indigenous people \u201clive different\u201d, says Doris, and need housing that reflects it. \u2022\u2022\u2022 The Australian Bureau of Statistic considers severe overcrowding (where four or more extra bedrooms are needed to adequately accommodate people) to be a form of homelessness. It has made up the largest homelessness group for the past three censuses. Indigenous people are 15 times more likely to be sleeping rough or living in improvised dwellings or tents. More than 26,000 were homeless on census night but Homelessness Australia says this could be an undercount as many don\u2019t consider themselves to be \u201chomeless\u201d if they are sleeping on country. The organisation said almost one quarter of people supported by specialist homelessness services in 2014-15 were Indigenous, including more than one in four children under 10. Efforts to improve housing have included blanket approaches, targeted initiatives and individual projects, and many have been contentious. A national partnership on remote housing \u2013 the Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program (Sihip) \u2013 ends in June 2018. The program has been criticised for being expensive, bureaucratic and slow, and there remains $200m in houses yet to be built. Lajamanu was one of 16 communities identified under Sihip in which 750 new houses would be built at an average cost of $300,000 each. However a 2010 report by the auditor general found the cost estimate didn\u2019t appear to take into consideration price changes, the high cost of transportation or additional costs like disability access or the increased size in houses required in remote communities. A revised estimate in 2009 increased the cost of a single house to an average of $450,000, but the governments maintained their targets with the same pool of funding. This year the NT government embarked on a decade-long $1.1bn Indigenous housing project, including $500m for new housing and $200m for upgrades to existing homes to better accommodate more people. The \u201croom to breathe\u201d upgrade program has begun and the chief minister, Michael Gunner, said 129 projects were already under way. Targets were based on about 600 new rooms per year, rather than number of houses, he says. \u201cWe know there is a massive issue,\u201d Gunner tells Guardian Australia. \u201cSihip ... didn\u2019t get us there towards solving it. We know we need a detailed response to this; you can\u2019t just build three-bedders and four-bedders, you\u2019ve got to do things that respond to local community needs.\u201d The NT government has called for the commonwealth to match its $1.1bn funding in the new partnership agreement. The commonwealth has suggested it will be seeking a similar arrangement from states. \u201cAboriginal people are still struggling,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cWhen will the next government listen? It looks like we\u2019re begging them. We belong here, our ancestors didn\u2019t come by boat, they\u2019ve been here always, since the creation. \u201cBut we want to share this country in a friendly good way, not fighting one another, not criticising one another. We need to be respected too.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 In reference to the charts, Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) are medium-sized, general purpose areas that are the smallest area for the release of Australian Bureau of Statistics census data."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
