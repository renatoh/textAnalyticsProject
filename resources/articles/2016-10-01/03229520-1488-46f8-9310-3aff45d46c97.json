Ag\u00fcero came on for the final 11 minutes, by which time City were 3-0 down to a Messi hat-trick and it had been noticeable that before the kick-off the striker had not gone through the warm-up drills with the other substitutes. Guardiola said that he had dropped Ag\u00fcero because he wanted an extra body in midfield. It was Bravo who played the villain in City colours. The former Barcelona player erred with a sloppy pass outside his area on 52 minutes, which went straight to Luis Su\u00e1rez and he then handled the Barcelona striker\u2019s attempted lob. Bravo was still outside his box and was dismissed for a deliberate handball. It had looked like a moment to highlight the flaws in Guardiola\u2019s demand for his goalkeeper to play out from the back but the manager insisted he would not change his style. He also promised to stand by Bravo, who will now be suspended for Barcelona\u2019s visit to Manchester in two weeks\u2019 time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but until the last day of my career as a coach I will try to play from our goalkeeper,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThere are moments you have to kick the ball out and against Everton on Saturday we played four or five times the long ball. But he tried to play it and sometimes this happens. \u201cThere will be no change [of goalkeeper]. It stays the same. Football is a game of mistakes. He knows what he did. He has a lot of experience and he\u2019s one of the best goalkeepers in the last 10 years. I don\u2019t have doubts about him. He\u2019s disappointed but he will learn from that.\u201d Guardiola and his Barcelona counterpart, Luis Enrique, felt that the sending-off was the turning point. City were in the game at 1-0 at that stage but, with 10 men, they were overrun. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult enough to play Barcelona with 11 men,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWith 10 the game was over. Until then the game was open. Up to that point there aren\u2019t many regrets. We\u2019d created enough chances and arrived at the byline many times. We played with huge personality and we did create two or three clear chances. We are a new club, getting to know each other in a process. My perception is that we did well, knowing where we\u2019ve come from and who we are. We\u2019ve been brave. We started really well in the second half and then to play 10 versus 11 and to go 2-0 down [shortly afterwards] \u2013 it\u2019s so complicated. When Messi, Neymar and Su\u00e1rez attack you, it\u2019s very complicated. They punish you.\u201d Guardiola said he had told Ag\u00fcero of his decision to drop him earlier in the day and that he had taken it well. \u201cHe didn\u2019t warm up [before the game] but it was OK,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI wanted one more midfield player in that position and that was the reason why. I spoke with him and he was good.\u201d Bravo\u2019s mistake was the most glaring but there were several others on which Barcelona capitalised. \u201cEvery game since Celtic [in the previous Champions League game] has been the same,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cAgainst Everton it was two missed penalties. We need to change the atmosphere.\u201d Luis Enrique said: \u201cWe have seen really grave mistakes [from City] and that\u2019s always an advantage. We were able to make the most of those mistakes. We also saw Messi\u2019s ability to finish clinically as though he was in his own back yard or on a school pitch.\u201d Bravo admitted his mistake had ended City\u2019s hopes of coming back from a goal down. \u201cThe sending-off changed the course of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were playing very well, but football is like that. It\u2019s a game of mistakes and correct decisions. It\u2019s just bad luck that I was the person who changed the game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
