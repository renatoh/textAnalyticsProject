Despite recent events, and a need to check the website before setting out, the plan remains the same: a vibrant celebration of diverse lifestyles. Big names of music, cabaret, comedy and arts, including Alexandra Burke, Blue, Pam Ann and Pixie Lott, fill the Gaydar Main Arena. In Sackville Gardens and the Village Square local entertainment should be as big a draw, and there'll also be an abundance of market and expo stalls. From drag cabaret to a Candlelit Vigil for people with HIV, the message is clear: come together. City centre, Fri to 29 Aug Katrina Dixon Isle Of Wight Garlic Festival, Sandown Dodgy are back. And apparently they love garlic. If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for the Isle of Wight. They're headlining this summer's joyous hooray for the stinking rose, as garlic is also known. Now in its 26th year, the two-day sprall features 250 stallholders peddling the likes of garlic beer and garlic ice cream. The festival's crowning glory is the Garlic Marquee \u2013 a tent piled high with mountains ofproduce from the island's award-winning Garlic Farm. Aside from the wondrous bulbs there'll be food stalls, cooking demonstrations, a petting zoo, a children's railway and a full, loud programme of live music. Fighting Cocks Crossroads, Sat, Sun Clare Considine Beside The Seaside (Hell &amp; High Water), Bognor Regis Grab a deckchair and knot a hanky round your head as Bognor's quirky beach event celebrates the English seaside with aptly eccentric activities.

Jigsaw fans will try to complete shoreline puzzles against a tidal deadline in the King Canute Challenge, while the beach is otherwise kept busy with a kayak race, duck hunt, and hobby horse steeplechase. That most British of seafront pursuits, metal-detecting, is also paid tribute to in Output Arts' sonic installation Lost &amp; Sound. Seafront, Sun Colette Bernhardt Out &amp; about See No Evil, Bristol, Sat Art contests, workshops, street performances, music and food stalls join big international street art names including Inkie.
