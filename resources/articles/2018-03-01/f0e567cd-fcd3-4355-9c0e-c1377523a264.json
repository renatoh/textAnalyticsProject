In a move that is unlikely to prove popular with David Elleray, who was charged with drawing up how VAR will operate in his role as the technical director of the International Football Association Board, the Guardian has learned there is a growing acceptance among leading match officials that showing replays in relation to VAR would be more of a help than a hindrance. The use of VAR has proved controversial in English football this season and one of the issues to have emerged is that fans attending matches where the technology is in place are often left in the dark as to why a decision is being reviewed, sometimes resulting in lengthy delays where they sit in silence with no access to any footage, in stark contrast to those watching at home. In the eighth version of the Ifab\u2019s guidelines on the implementation of VAR, it states that \u201cin principle\u201d replays of incidents that are being reviewed should not be shown in the stadium. Although the advice in that section goes on to say that \u201cit is very strongly recommended that, as a minimum, a message appears on the stadium screen announcing that a review is taking place\u201d, it is fairly clear that the Ifab is opposed to showing footage of the incident in question to everyone in the ground. That section reads: \u201cVery careful consideration should be given to whether, within existing competition protocols, replay footage is shown as this may cause negative reactions, security issues etc, especially where the incident/decision is not clear-cut. In principle, replays of incidents which are or have been reviewed should not be shown on screens in the stadium.\u201d Although Premier League clubs are not allowed to show footage of replays of controversial incidents on stadium screens at the moment, there is a school of thought that VAR reviews are a different case, not least because the officials should, in theory, arrive at the correct decision come the end. Displaying the images would also demonstrate to the supporters why the game has been stopped for a review and, in doing so, involve them in the process to an extent. Leaving aside the supporter experience inside the stadium, the time that elapses while an incident is being reviewed is seen as a problem in itself and has led to plenty of criticism. Match officials are confident, however, that the speed of the decision-making in relation to VAR will improve with more training and practice. All the top-flight match officials are due to convene at Stockley Park in London this month for a meeting that will be solely dedicated to VAR and with a view to trying to streamline a process that has prompted several Premier League managers and players to voice their disapproval, raising questions about whether the time is right for video technology to become a permanent fixture in English football. The Premier League clubs will meet in April to vote on the introduction of VAR for the start of next season, with a two-thirds majority required for it to be rolled out from August. It is understood that Swansea, Stoke and Huddersfield are among those to be undecided at present and to harbour some reservations about VAR, although the feeling among other clubs is that teething problems can be resolved and enough of the league\u2019s members will vote in favour to get it over the line. Peter Coates, Stoke\u2019s chairman, told the Guardian that he was initially in favour of embracing VAR but admitted he has since become \u201cless and less enamoured\u201d by the idea. \u201cWhen we were discussing it at Premier League level, my opinion was \u2018yes\u2019, provided it was limited to certain key areas and that\u2019s all,\u201d Coates said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t realise \u2013 well, so far, to me \u2013 how poorly it is actually operated in practice. I\u2019m completely against this long delay. That\u2019s not how we thought it would work. We thought there would be hardly any delay.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
