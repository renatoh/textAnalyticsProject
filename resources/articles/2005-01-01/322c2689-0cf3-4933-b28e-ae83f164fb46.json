Stupidly I'd left my new DS at home but my GBA SP saved the day and I soon got stuck into some Zelda: Minish Cap. While I was busy collecting figurines across Hyrule I noticed a couple of commuters giving me that \"what is a grown man doing with that\" look. Philistines obviously, but it does raise an important point for the new handhelds. They need to be designed so that over 18s would be happy to use them in public. Of course, the most important factors are the games, pricing and, sadly, the marketing, but Sony/Nintendo and the rest need to make sure the design is right too. Embarrassment is not an option - remember the sidetalking nightmare that Nokia had with their original N-Gage? The Game Boy Advance SP was an understated and pleasing design while the PSP is no slacker in the looks department, but I'm not sure how the DS will go down. I remember being at the GBA SP launch when David Gosen, then MD of Nintendo Europe, mentioned how adults wouldn't feel ashamed using the SP on a train. And he was generally right (today was the first time I've noticed any reaction). But the DS may be a different story. Its distinctive, and slightly cheap, look certainly can't compare to the PSP, but if you want to play Mario, Wario Ware and other dual-screen goodies - and I do - then the DS is the one. I'll see how it goes this week when I take it out in public for the first time. Be interested to hear how any of you importers have got on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
