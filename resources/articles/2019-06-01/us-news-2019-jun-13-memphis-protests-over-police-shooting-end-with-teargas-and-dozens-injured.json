Armed officers faced off in the Tennessee city with crowds angered by news that federal marshals had shot dead a local man, whom authorities described as a fugitive, officials said. Memphis\u2019s mayor, Jim Strickland, said six officers were taken to the hospital. He said at a news conference on Thursday morning that in the course of the unrest he was impressed by law enforcement officers\u2019 \u201cprofessionalism and incredible restraint as they endured concrete rocks being thrown at them and people spitting at them\u201d. By late on Wednesday night, officers had resorted to using teargas in the working-class Frayser neighborhood north of downtown Memphis, before protesters dispersed about 11pm local time. During the unrest, several police cars were vandalized, and windows were shattered at a neighborhood fire house, Strickland also said in a Facebook post. The incident that led to protests and clashes unfolded about 7pm. At that time, \u201cmultiple officers\u201d with the US marshals service\u2019s Gulf Coast regional fugitive taskforce came across a man who was \u201cwanted on multiple warrants\u201d, the authorities said. He was outside a home and getting into a vehicle when marshals encountered him and tried to arrest him, according to the Tennessee bureau of investigation. \u201cWhile attempting to stop the individual, he reportedly rammed his vehicle into the officers\u2019 vehicles multiple times before exiting with a weapon,\u201d the bureau asserted in a statement. \u201cThe officers fired, striking and killing the individual. No officers were injured.\u201d Police were called to the area for crowd control after news of the shooting circulated online. As more protesters arrived, more police appeared, ultimately leading to confrontation. Tami Sawyer, a Shelby county commissioner who is also vying to become Memphis\u2019s next mayor, referred to the man who was shot as Brandon Webber. She appealed to the public to ask relevant questions and consider context before drawing conclusions on the situation. \u201cI was in Frayser tonight because Brandon Webber was shot 16-20 times in his family\u2019s front yard,\u201d Sawyer tweeted. Sawyer also said on Twitter that officials deployed teargas. Tennessee bureau of investigation agents were \u201cinvestigating the circumstances\u201d of this shooting at the request of the Memphis-area district attorney\u2019s office. \u201cThis remains an active and ongoing investigation, as TBI special agents and forensic scientists continue to work to gather any and all relevant interviews and evidence,\u201d agency officials said. \u201cThe TBI does not identify the officers involved in these types of incidents and instead refers questions of that nature to their respective department,\u201d officials said. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)civil rights organization said it was closely monitoring the situation. In a statement on Thursday afternoon about the shooting, US marshals service officials said they \u201cwere attempting to serve a warrant on a 20-year-old man with multiple felony warrants\u201d. \u201cIn response to a threat posed by the subject, members of the task force fired their weapons, striking and killing him.\u201d The US marshals said they will \u201calso conduct an internal review after the state completes its investigation\u201d. \u201cAs a matter of policy, the US marshals service will not release the names of deputy marshals involved in shooting incidents, until the conclusion of all investigation,\u201d they said in a statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
