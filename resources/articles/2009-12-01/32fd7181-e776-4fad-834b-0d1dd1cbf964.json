The manner, however, of United's pressing home of their advantage served as a statement of intent that would have been read with most interest at Stamford Bridge. If Sir Alex Ferguson's team have been erratic, at times, this season, flattering to deceive with some of their performances, this was a return to the slickness of old. West Ham, booed off at half-time and full-time and, on this evidence, contenders for relegation, had no answer. Robert Green, the goalkeeper, admitted defeat in his personal battle against illness and went off after the fourth goal, having earlier vomited in his six-yard box. He was not the only queasy figure in claret and blue. While Scholes' goal stirred memories of the past, United's clinching second hinted at what could lie ahead. The impressive Darron Gibson followed his two-goal performance in the Carling Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur last Wednesday with an even more irresistible strike from distance. Lessons have clearly been learned from the master. Gibson's right-footed first-time blast climaxed a swift United counter and dumped West Ham on to the canvas. Ferguson's team showed no mercy and two goals inside a minute added the gloss to the scoreline. First, Anderson's driven centre from the left presented Antonio Valencia with a tap-in and then a wonderful move involving Scholes, Wayne Rooney, the substitute Dimitar Berbatov and Valencia, finished with Rooney rolling home his 11th club goal of the season. The only disappointment for Ferguson was a deepening of his defensive injury worries. Nemanja Vidic was his latest pre-match casualty, with a virus, and so he had been forced to play the midfielder Darren Fletcher at right-back and Gary Neville in the middle. Neville, however, lasted only 34 minutes after he felt his groin tighten. On came Michael Carrick, the former West Ham midfielder, to fill in at centre-half. United would finish the game with 10 men when, with all three substitutes on, Wes Brown was forced off. Ferguson said he hoped to have Vidic back for Tuesday night's Champions League tie against Wolfsburg and added that he was likely to ask Carrick to reprise his defensive role alongside him. It was incumbent on West Ham that they examined United's makeshift backline. Their failure grated with their fans. West Ham have made strides of sorts since they came back to draw 2-2 here with Arsenal in October and they might have opened the scoring following a rare error from Ryan Giggs. His misplaced pass invited Zavon Hines to cross but Giggs atoned with a saving challenge on Jack Collison. West Ham's afternoon did not get any better. The United goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak was required to make only one serious save, from the substitute Alessandro Diamanti's free-kick in the 62nd minute. \"It was a great performance from us, especially in the second half,\" said Ferguson. \"Scholes was incredible, he has been doing that for so many years. West Ham are a very young team and when they went 2-0 down, it was difficult for them.\" The reaction of the Upton Park crowd to the half-time whistle reflected the manner in which United had gradually taken control. United got the goal that their probing hinted at in first-half injury-time. Giggs weaved on the left, he crossed and Danny Gabbidon headed clear only as far as the edge of the penalty area. Radoslav Kovac seemed to have Scholes covered, yet he somehow allowed the veteran to bring the ball under control and, in one movement, squeeze past him. Scholes' shot proved too powerful for Green to keep out. West Ham flickered at the beginning of the second half yet their hopes were extinguished by Gibson's rocket. Thereafter, it became a question of how many United would score. The answer brought misery to West Ham's supporters. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Pete May, HammersintheHeart My wife wanted me to go to the climate change march. I wish I'd gone now as the West Ham defence certainly doesn't look saveable. We played reasonably well first half but we paid for being lax just before half-time when Paul Scholes scored. We have no one with any real defensive know-how since Lucas Neill left. And without Matthew Upson at the back and Carlton Cole up front we lacked any muscular presence to worry United. We never looked a threat and when Michael Carrick came on to play at centre-back, we made him look like Franz Beckenbauer. The fan's player ratings Green 5 (Kurucz 73 5); Spector 4, Tomkins 5, Gabbidon 5, Ilunga 4; Collison 4, Kovac 5 (Dyer 67 5) Parker 5, Stanislas 4; Franco 6, Hines 5 (Diamanti 46 5) Mark Harrison, Independent United Supporters We had to work hard early on but once Scholes scored it was all over as West Ham didn't offer much at all. They were obviously missing Carlton Cole a lot. Scholes and Giggs, again, were very good for us \u2013 that almost goes without saying \u2013 but Anderson was the lynchpin. Everything we created he was involved in. Michael Carrick also slotted in brilliantly at centre-back when Gary Neville went off, as though he'd always played there. West Ham is never an easy place to win at, so to win by four goals was brilliant and it signals our intent to Chelsea. The fan's player ratings Kuszczak 7; Fletcher 8, Neville 6 (Carrick 34 9), Brown 8, Evra 7; Gibson 7 (Berbatov 67 5) , Anderson 9; Valencia 9, Scholes 9; Giggs 8; Rooney 7 (Owen 72 5) TO TAKE PART IN THE FANS' VERDICT, EMAIL FANS.PREMIER@OBSERVER.CO.UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
