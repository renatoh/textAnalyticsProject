The vote, which took place this morning, saw 97% of customers voting in favour of the company losing its mutual status. Members who own with-profits policies are likely to receive total payments averaging \u00a32,000 each. Some 1.7 million members of the life insurer will receive a fixed allocation of 200 shares each, with about 60% of them receiving additional shares depending upon the size of their polices and how long they have held them. The Friends Provident demutualisation follows hot on the heels of the Scottish Life announcement last week. Customers of the Scottish insurer voted in favour of sale of the life office to Royal London, a Colchester-based mutual insurer, on Thursday. Nearly half a million Scottish Life customers will reap average windfalls of nearly \u00a34,000 following the vote for demutualisation. It was widely expected that customers of Friends Provident, which will float on the stockmarket on July 9, would vote in favour of a float due to the size of the windfalls involved. \"We are delighted that the demutualisation and flotation proposal has received such a resounding endorsement from our members,\" said David Newbigging, chairman of Friends Provident. Another mutual is likely to go the same way next week, when members of Scottish Provident must vote on its future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
