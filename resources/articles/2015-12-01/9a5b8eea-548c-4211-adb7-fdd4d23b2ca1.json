Here\u2019s what\u2019s crackling in politics: Rubio and Cruz beef continues to build The rival Republican camps of Florida senator Marco Rubio and Texas senator Ted Cruz threw jabs Wednesday after the candidates clashed at Tuesday\u2019s debate over immigration and national security. The conservative blogosphere burbled with signs of resentment that Cruz was attacking Rubio while laying off Trump. Candidates flee Vegas... except Carson Speaking of Trump, he popped up in his airplane in Mesa, Arizona, for what looked like a sizable rally. Cruz flew to Los Angeles while Rubio hit Iowa and then New Hampshire. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, though, stayed for a rally in Las Vegas, where he predicted he would be a one-term president, at most. Congress announces deal on taxes and spending Early Wednesday morning, House speaker Paul Ryan announced that leaders of both chambers had reached a bipartisan agreement on a tax ($650bn)-and-spending ($1.1tn) package that Congress is likely to pass later in the week. Apparently even the Freedom Caucus bought it. Quote of the day They are all saying that fear stuff and trying to use it for their own benefit. But I\u2019m not as fearful as them.\u201d \u2013 an Iowa Republican voter to Ben Jacobs, on the candidates To-go cup Trump in Mesa: Rubio-Cruz continues: How embarrassed does Trump look to be holding a copy of Playboy with himself on the cover? In which Benjy Sarlin at MSNBC helpfully explains what that Cruz-Rubio immigration fight last night was all about. \u201cLike a lot of arguments involving two senators, the fight rests on a complicated argument over policy, procedure, and tactics,\u201d Sarlin writes. The two argued about where they stand now on handling the estimated 11m undocumented migrants in the United States, where they stand now on the question of admitting more immigrants legally, and where they stood in 2013, when a group of senators including Rubio led the passage of an immigration reform bill. Here\u2019s Sarlin on a shift in Cruz\u2019s position on what to do with undocumented immigrants: But on illegal immigration, things get more complex. Cruz has spent months and months and monthsducking questions as to what he would eventually do with undocumented immigrants, usually saying it\u2019s a \u201cconversation\u201d for another time once the border is secure. Read this exchange with Chuck Todd onMeet The Press from July. It\u2019s almost painful how much Cruz does not want to address this topic. That changed on Tuesday, though, when Rubio challenged Cruz to say whether he favors legal status or not. For the first time, Cruz appeared to shift decisively against it. \u201cI have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization,\u201d Cruz said. Rubio\u2019s camp pointed to the phrase \u201cintend\u201d as an obvious weasel word... There\u2019s much more where that came from. Read the full thing here. (h/t: @bencjacobs) At his Las Vegas event, Ben Carson has speculated that his presidency, should it materialize, might only last for one term, because of the unpopular though salubrious choices he would have to work, Dave Weigel of the Washington Post reports: \u201cIf I\u2019m successful in this endeavor to become president of the United States, it\u2019s very likely I would be a one-term president,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThere are some tough things that need to be done.\u201d Read the full piece, including Carson\u2019s expanding on a Muslim Brotherhood infiltration conspiracy theory he alluded to in the debate, here. Less than 12 hours after the end of the last Republican debate of 2015, Marco Rubio was back on the campaign trail in a hotel ballroom in Ankeny, Iowa, reports Ben Jacobs: Rubio, who has devoted a disproportionate amount of time to campaigning in this prosperous suburb, gave a relatively short, breezy version of his stump speech where he seamlessly incorporated his opening statement from last night\u2019s debate and then spent just as long working the rope line, taking selfies and shaking hands with the crowd of about 100 who filled the room. [...] But not everyone in the crowd shared Rubio\u2019s foreign policy approach. Dennis Dietz of Polk City, a registered Democrat, told the Guardian: \u201cI switched out of the Republican party because of this kind of fear-mongering.\u201d A self-described \u201cBob Dole kind of person\u201d, Dietz was disappointed with Rubio\u2019s hawkish rhetoric. \u201cThey are all saying that fear stuff and trying to use it for their own benefit. But I\u2019m not as fearful as them.\u201d Read the full piece here. Rubio in Iowa, all smiles at the day\u2019s headlines. Hillary Clinton is in Omaha, Nebraska, today. Nebraska\u2019s a solidly Republican state but one of two states, with Maine, to divide the electoral votes it awards by congressional district. Omaha\u2019s in district 2, which Barack Obama picked off in 2008, despite a strong statewide performance by Republican nominee John McCain. Look who showed up with Clinton: Warren Buffett, the world\u2019s third-richest person. Our live blog coverage is here. Meanwhile, at a Ben Carson rally in Las Vegas: And Trump\u2019s in Arizona: [Google thinks it\u2019s 52 in Mesa] As the debate unfolded in Las Vegas, House speaker Paul Ryan went to work to sell a bipartisan tax-and-spending deal to his caucus, ultimately issuing a statement of a sealed deal after midnight. The House plans to pass the package as two separate bills, to be rolled together for the Senate to pass, likely later this week. Congress was expected pass yet another piece of legislation to avert the risk of a government shutdown before the new package is in place. Ryan said the spending bill puts a two-year moratorium on a tax on medical devices and postpones the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on costly health care plans. Additionally, the agreement extends valuable tax reflief to lumber companies, racetrack owners, apple growers, cider makers and others, according to the New York Times. The tax breaks are worth about $650bn and the spending bill weighs in at $1.1tn, according to the Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019m not real happy with the omnibus,\u201d Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline, a Republican of Minnesota, told Roll Call. But if you\u2019re going to move forward and follow Speaker Ryan\u2019s notion that we\u2019re going to move on the offense this year and go back to regular order and pass all the appropriations bills then I think many of my colleagues will look at it like I do, that we need to move past this, get this done. Let\u2019s put 2015 behind us and get onto 2016.\u201d TrusTed get it Even after the final debate of the year, Republicans in the key early voting state of Iowa haven\u2019t yet settled on a candidate, reports Ben Jacobs from interviews conducted last night in Waukee, Iowa: On a gloomy Tuesday night, about two dozen Republican stalwarts, many of whom were campaign staffers, came out to an Irish bar in a suburban Des Moines strip mall to watch the debate and assess the candidates. After the debate, four caucus-goers who represented a fair cross section of establishment Republican sentiment offered mixed reviews of the moderators and the candidates. Shane Blanchard, a member of the city council in Waukee, said: \u201cI think CNN did a good job,\u201d although he expressed some concerns about the lengthy back-and-forth exchanges between candidates like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. \u201cI think, you know, when they get going back and forth like that and it goes for so long it does a disservice to the debate,\u201d he added. Rod Shirk of West Des Moines shared these concerns: \u201cI\u2019d like to see more cohesiveness instead of divisiveness.\u201d Read the full piece here. The Bush team cuts a web video around the candidate\u2019s attack lines last night on Trump: Annoyed into responding by Bush\u2019s badgering, Trump last night snapped: \u201cI\u2019m at 42 and you\u2019re at three!\u201d A factcheck shows us that while the recent Monmouth University poll had Trump at 41% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning voters and Bush at 3%, the national polling averages have Trump closer to 33 and Bush clear up at 4. While former Florida governor Jeb Bush spent Tuesday evening attacking Trump, Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, noticably laid off the polling frontrunner. Christie continued to pull his punches this morning. Not good primary politics to attack the Donald, it appears he\u2019s decided. Or maybe this is simply the way he feels. If you missed last night\u2019s proceedings, you can experience them as if in real time here, on our live blog: The Republican debate on Tuesday in Las Vegas was so long ago that Marco Rubio has already stopped in Iowa en route to New Hampshire, Ted Cruz is already under Senate investigation and a central conjecture of the candidates\u2019 discussion on national security appears to have folded. Never fear \u2013 we\u2019ll catch you up and run along the campaign trail so you don\u2019t have to. Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs was with Rubio in Ankeny, Iowa... ... while Sabrina Siddiqui and Paul Lewis in Las Vegas have delivered a comprehensive analysis of last night\u2019s proceedings, for those still catching up: (There\u2019s this, too, from columnist Jeb Lund on the Strip.) As for Cruz, Senate intelligence chair Richard Burr says his staff is looking into the possibility that the candidate aired classified info in his discussion onstage last night of how the USA Freedom Act changed the NSA\u2019s ability to search phone numbers. Burr didn\u2019t watch the debate, though, with more urgent programming to see: UPDATE: Reuters reports that the suspects in the San Bernardino terror attacks did not describe their intentions to commit terrorist acts on social media, as has been widely reported and as discussed extensively last night be the candidates. The \u201cfact\u201d that the department of homeland security \u201cfailed\u201d to search the suspects\u2019 social media accounts, many Republican candidates said, pointed to alarming flaws in the country\u2019s procedures for screening immigrants, and to a basic incompetence at the core of the Obama administration. Except it appears there were no social media posts. (CNN is reporting elsewhere, however, that the FBI has concluded the suspects exchanged direct messages in 2013 stating their intentions.) What else? Rand Paul was on a roll last night: And this mashup is not representative of anything that actually happened onstage in Las Vegas and yet is mildly amusing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
