He can now look down on his co-creation every day from his new office in one of the development\u2019s towers and see hundreds of people climbing up and down Thomas Heatherwick\u2019s Vessel sculpture, like tiny maggots crawling all over a rotting doner kebab. The first phase of Hudson Yards opened last month and people have indeed come \u2013 mostly to gawp at how it could have been allowed to happen. On a vast swath of the west side of Manhattan once earmarked for New York\u2019s 2012 Olympic bid, a developer has conjured a private fantasy of angular glass towers stuffed with offices and expensive apartments, rising above a seven-storey shopping mall on an endless grey carpet, sprinkled with small tufts of \u201cpark\u201d. The surprising thing isn\u2019t that such a development has happened. The real shock is that it\u2019s quite so bad. Hudson Yards\u2019 marketing hype is showered with superlatives: this is the largest and most expensive private real estate project in US history, a place bursting with \u201cnever-before-seen\u201d retail concepts and \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d dining destinations. It is billed as the ultimate in everything, a refined playground for discerning urbanites, with stores where you can spend five figures on a wristwatch and $800 on a haircut. Yet it all feels so cheap. From the architectural zoo of convulsing angles to the apparent lack of care spent on the details, this is bargain-basement building-by-the-yard stuff that would feel more at home in the second-tier city of a developing economy. Stephen Ross, the billionaire boss of the Related Companies and driving force of the project, described it as a \u201cmuseum of architecture\u201d, which isn\u2019t untrue. Walking through Hudson Yards feels like browsing a cladding depot, where panels of curtain-wall glazing, brushed aluminium and bits of stone collide in a wonky collage. The hot mess starts on the skyline, way before you reach the elevated podium on which this self-contained city is laid out. The first megalith to come into view is 30 Hudson Yards, the larger of a pair of towers designed by stalwarts of corporate Americana, Kohn Pedersen Fox. It climbs up into the sky in ungainly lumps, with a triangular observation deck wedged into its side near the top, forming a pointy beak that gives it the look of an angry chicken. While this tower leans in one direction, its stumpier partner tilts in another, forming what the developer optimistically calls \u201ca dance of sleek giants\u201d. It is a tableau that almost elicits pity, like chubby fowl engaged in their first awkward mating ritual. As you get closer, the pity dissolves into anger. Rather than inviting passersby in, the development turns its back, presenting a mostly blank frontage of service hatches and lift lobbies to the city, with an entrance at each corner to suck you up into the mall. Step inside and you find a shopping centre as prosaic as they come. With its plasterboard soffits and shiny fascia, it makes the likes of Dior, Fendi and Cartier look like discount stores. Continue west and you are spat out on to the central plaza to be confronted by the mother of all novelty public art, like a mutant lovechild of New York\u2019s two favourite snacks: the pretzel and the shawarma. Thomas Heatherwick\u2019s Vessel has been compared to many things, from a wastepaper basket to the expandable foam mesh for packaging fruit, but the designer prefers to cite the form of India\u2019s ancient step wells. These great stone structures served a crucial purpose: to make it easy for people to reach water for washing, cooking and religious functions. Heatherwick\u2019s basket of staircases, on the other hand, is the embodiment of selfie-driven spectacle, a lattice of 2,500 photo opportunities woven together in a vertical panopticon. \u201cVessel TKA\u201d, as it is officially known while it awaits the result of its public naming competition (entries to which include Stairy McStairface and Meat Tornado), has proved to be a magnet for near-universal ire, but it is by no means the worst thing in Hudson Yards. Traversing its landings and participating in the collective gawping is an entertaining experience, and the $200m (\u00a3153.4m) structure provides some good views over the surrounding architectural car crash. But what isn\u2019t evident until you visit in person is quite how shoddy it seems. Heatherwick projects have had some practical hiccups in the past \u2013 Manchester\u2019s B of the Bang had to be dismantled after a big steel spike fell off, while Newcastle\u2019s Blue Carpet paving faded to grey and needs constant repair \u2013 but this structure takes it to a whole new level. Ascending the ticketed selfie-scrum last week, on a single route of 154 possible staircases, I encountered a smashed glazing panel, chipped steps and several places where duct tape had been used to stick errant pieces of cladding back on \u2013 after the thing had been open for just two weeks. Some steps look as if they have been crookedly cut on site to fit, while handrails crash into parts of the steel structure as if no one thought about how the two parts might meet. The Vessel\u2019s relationship with the privately owned \u201cpublic space\u201d around it is revealing, too. Try to sit on the stone steps around its base and you will be instantly shooed away by a security guard. The outcome is all the more galling given that the one truly public element of Hudson Yards was intended to occupy this central space. The Shed, an arts venue conceived by Diller Scofidio + Renfro (DS+R) with the Rockwell Group, was the result of a request for proposals issued by the city in 2008 for a cultural attraction for the site. \u201cWe only had two requirements,\u201d says Doctoroff, who is now CEO of Google\u2019s urban planning arm, Sidewalk Labs. \u201cIt had to be different than anything else in New York, and it had to keep the city at the leading edge of culture in the world.\u201d DS+R and Rockwell\u2019s plan originally imagined four nesting shells that would slide out into the centre of the plaza, but the developer had other ideas. \u201cIn 2011, Related asked us to get out of the way,\u201d recalls Liz Diller. \u201cThe deployable building was getting in the way of people being able to see their shops.\u201d The Shed was shrunk and flipped 90 degrees, so now its events plaza fills a gap in front of an office lobby, while its entrances are tucked away like poor doors at the lower street level. The physical result betrays the nature of the forced marriage. When I asked Diller about the lack of views from inside her sliding inflatable performance shell, on a site tour last year, she was frank: \u201cThe surrounding buildings are not so gorgeous, so we didn\u2019t want to focus people\u2019s attention outside.\u201d As we approached the Vessel, she added: \u201cOut here you have a view to \u2026 well, let\u2019s not talk about that.\u201d Back on the plaza, the place has distinct echoes of the World Trade Center site, where a similar lack of joined-up thinking has produced an equally placeless place. Any sense of the local character has been obliterated. Hudson Yards is suspended above 30 functioning train tracks, yet they have been swept under the pristine grey matt. Perhaps industrial grit wasn\u2019t compatible with a place for the \u201ctrendiest urban dwellers\u201d, where a duplex goes for $32m and a two-bed starts at $9,000 per month. How could one masterplan led by a single developer have created this, especially in a context that, according to the New School think-tank, benefited from almost $6bn in state funding and tax breaks? \u201cYou have to remember that post-9/11 was a very different time,\u201d says Doctoroff. \u201cThis was a totally new area and we had to encourage people to come out here and take a leap of faith. It was a frontier, so the bulk of the funding was spent on the provision of infrastructure and extending the subway.\u201d He says that the criticism of generous tax breaks is \u201cridiculous\u201d, claiming the city will earn back $20bn in tax revenue when the project is complete. But couldn\u2019t they have insisted on a better deal than having only 10% of the 4,000 flats classed as \u201caffordable\u201d? \u201cBack in 2005, no one was talking about affordable housing,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, if you include the wider area, the percentage is much higher. We were really ahead of the curve.\u201d Used as a freight yard for decades, Hudson Yards had a chequered history. In 2005, the city earmarked the area for its 2012 Olympic bid, and it was drastically re-zoned for tall buildings. The Olympic dream died, but the opportunity was there for a developer with a big enough backer. In the wake of the financial crash in 2009, Related swooped in with Oxford Properties Group, a Canadian investment company owned by the Ontario municipal workers\u2019 pension fund, and bought the site for $1bn. Their plans grew ever fatter. As a 2017 report by the Municipal Art Society of New York revealed, dozens of separate land-use applications have been approved since the environmental impact assessment of the initial rezoning, resulting in huge increases of floor area. They calculate the outcome represents a combined underestimation of the Hudson Yards development by the size of almost three Chrysler Buildings. With this history in mind, the lack of care that has been spent on trying to make it a good place makes more sense. This swollen appendage to Manhattan is not a new neighbourhood for New York, but a blunt vehicle for making money, a strange offshore tumescence of global capital to service multitudes of Canadian public-sector pensioners, hundreds of miles away. \u2022 This article was corrected on 9 April 2019.
