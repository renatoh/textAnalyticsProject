Only clubs with a 3,000 all-seater stadium and a weather protected pitch would be allowed to join. If bought to fruition, the launch of SPL2 would also be accompanied by a new cup competition. However, SPL chair Lex Gold said that they would consult widely before pushing ahead with the plan. \"Our clubs are sensitive to the impact a development of this nature could have on the remaining SFL clubs... We have, therefore, written to our colleagues in the SFL and the SFA to arrange an early discussion about the impact of these proposals and how they may best be brought into effect.\" Struggling without a sponsor and beset by low attendences, the Scottish sides are seeking to replacate the success of the English Championship, who's attendences since its rebrand in 2004 have overtaken those in Serie A."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
