I\u2019ll open can\u2019 (AMABILE), well ahead of those for MIMOSAE, PAPPOOSE and SANIES, all in joint second place. Nineteen clues received one or mentions. Nul points for my describing the Yankees as a basketball team. I knew them to be baseball players, but checked on Google to be sure, rather carelessly as it turns out. There was a New York Yankees basketball team, of no great fame, but this is now called the New York Knicks (for knickerbockers?). Anyway my apologies, especially to the transatlantic contingent, small but much valued, one of whom described the NY Yankees as \u2018the most famous team across any sport in the US, let alone America\u2019s \u201cNational Pastime\u201d, mostly because it is, like cricket, a game with plenty of longueurs for drinking beer\u2019. I don\u2019t have much to say about clues submitted this month, except that they were mostly sound if a little uninspired. This can happen if the word itself fails to get the creative juices flowing. The estimable actor Benedict Cumberbatch turned up quite often, as did references to the nail-biting events north of the border. One or two competitors opined that I had Morse in mind when choosing CUMBERSOME (last five letters). Not guilty, m\u2019lud. With reference to my comment in the last slip, CJM tells me that he has forgotten his clue to SHEEPRUN, but he still treasures the first prize-winner from W.K. M. (later Sir William) Slimmings: \u2018It might suggest a Bach chorale or a baa corral! (Puns here are out of place)\u2018. This was 1947, remember. Brilliant, still. There were a few grumbles about moving to the new edition of Chambers in 2015. I sympathize, but don\u2019t think that I can continue to recommend an earlier edition when a new one is available. Given the relatively few innovations introduced in the 13th edition, I\u2019m sure the 12th edition will continue to suffice for those disinclined to buy the new one just yet. I shall try to mention it when I use a word or phrase appearing in 13/e for the first time. The \u2018project editor\u2019 at Chambers has sent me the following (not wholly reassuring) message: \u2018We are working on compiling all the corrections for the reprint of the dictionary with the \u201chighlighted words\u201d from the 12th edition which have gone missing from the 13th edition \u2026 We will look to provide a free PDF available to download for free to purchasers of the first print of the 13th edition so they can have all the missing words at their disposal.\u2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
