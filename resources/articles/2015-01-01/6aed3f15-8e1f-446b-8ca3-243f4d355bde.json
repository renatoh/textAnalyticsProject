But after a new character had emerged on social media by shovelling snow off the Boston Marathon finish line, the first viral star of winter storm Juno was speaking out for the first time. The self-dubbed \u201cBoston Yeti\u201d became almost as notorious \u2013 and hated \u2013 as the mythological creature he was impersonating when he appeared in photos on Monday night on Twitter, then gained thousands of followers after creating the account @BostonYeti2015. He\u2019s brushing it off. \u201cI think anyone gaining some traction on social media is bound to face haters or those who aren\u2019t into what you\u2019re doing,\u201d the Yeti, who refused to reveal his true identity, wrote in an email interview, his first with a non-local outlet. \u201cThe number of people who have come forward and expressed their appreciation for the Boston Yeti greatly outweighs those trying to bring it down. I let those things roll off my shoulders \u2013 well, they often get stuck in my fur, but you get the idea.\u201d The Yeti claims to be from the Boston suburb of Somerville, and is a vegan. During his adventures on Monday night, the Yeti was spotted on Boston roads, helping families shovel and, on some occasions, barhopping. \u201cI\u2019m feeling lots of love from everyone,\u201d the Yeti said. \u201cEven the copycat Yeti\u2019s making the rounds in the Boston bar scene!\u201d While much of the north-east remained at home vegetating with their Netflix accounts, the Yeti was busy trying to help clear out the streets \u2013 even if he wasn\u2019t sharing as many exploits on Twitter anymore. \u201cThe storm is winding down and so, perhaps, I\u2019ll take advantage and have a nap,\u201d the Yeti said. He vanished from Twitter on Wednesday after a two-day flurry of posts. \u201cI think the city of Boston has done a wonderful job getting out there and making roads safer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI may try and go clear some snow myself. Given how large my feet are, I reckon I could clear some sidewalks with little effort.\u201d The Yeti, from the looks of photos posted online from various sightings, is about six feet tall, and covered in white fur. He does not condition. Massachusetts governor Charles Baker issued a statewide shutdown of roads, highways and public transportation for the duration of Tuesday. This didn\u2019t stop the Boston Yeti from getting around. \u201cI lost my license at a Taylor Swift concert earlier in the fall. So, mostly hitchhiking, cabs, and walking.\u201d Stories of Yetis and abominable snowmen have been a facet of history for over a thousand years. A Yeti features prominently in a Spicy Buffalo Wheat Thin commercial set to air during Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday. The Boston Yeti recognized his brethren instantly. \u201cI loved the ad,\u201d the Yeti wrote. \u201cThat Yeti is actually a second cousin of mine, so it\u2019s great to see him doing something with his life. The last I saw him, he was just laying low in the woods with little direction. I think he\u2019s found his calling.\u201d Alas, there were new characters emerging from the snow on Wednesday. As the snow subsides, the Boston Yeti plans to hibernate, and perhaps catch up on some Netflix. He has a few favorites he may be watching. \u201cI\u2019d recommend Abominable and a classic from the 1970s, Snowbeast.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
