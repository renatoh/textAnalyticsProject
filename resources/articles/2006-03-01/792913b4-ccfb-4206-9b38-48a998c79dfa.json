It propelled him to third most active post but also sparked a riposte from Neil Clark, who was elsewhere being attacked by Harry Hatchet for a defence of Milosovic. Lukashenko and Milosovic were the subject, too, of Ian Traynor's first post in which he mused on what he considers the strange alliance between hard left and extreme right over the issues of nationalism, intervention and attitudes to America. John Lloyd broadened the debate to pick up the discussion elsewhere (John Pilger, Andrew Murray, Polly Toynbee) over Tony Blair's defence this week of his foreign policy - making the case again for invading Iraq and intervening in Afghanistan. Lloyd concluded that the argument going partly between Guardian journalists about these matters may prove difficult for the Guardian but illuminated a wider point. Another hot debate this week has been the on-going argument about anti-semitism on the left. Mike Marqusee started it; David Hirsh sent it to one of the top topics on the site by his attack on Ken Livingstone's remarks this week to two Jewish businessmen. Elsewhere the Guardian leader calling for Tony Blair to stand down sooner rather than later following the loans scandal provoked spirited blogs from Jonathan Freedland , Martin Kettle and Derek Draper. Another bloody week in Iraq has provoked an interesting debate at the Guardian over whether we should continue to send reporters to cover the conflict, given the extreme danger. Read Harriet Sherwood, the foreign editor, on the Editors' blog. New this week is Steve Bell's page. Read the full back-story of If... , and meet the characters that have turned the strip into a cult over the past 25 years. Our third audio this week, Francis Fukyama in conversation with Jonathan Freedland, can be found here. Still to come, for the many of you who are complaining about it in various places on the site, is the ability to comment on all the pieces coming in from the Guardian and Observer, as well as the pieces on the blog. We're still working on it, but won't be long. Thanks to all bloggers and all commenters, as Jeff Jarvis says you're called, for making the site so lively this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
