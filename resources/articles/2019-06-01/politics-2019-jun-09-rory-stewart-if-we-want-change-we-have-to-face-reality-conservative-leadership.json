He insisted that it came from the ability to face reality. I came to the same conclusion in a different way. Having followed in my father\u2019s footsteps as a public servant in Indonesia, the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan, my life was changed not through my work but through the two years I spent walking across Asia, staying in over 500 village houses. It was there that I noticed most starkly the grotesque gap between the rhetoric of governments and the reality on the ground. Of course we must deliver Brexit. But we can\u2019t do it by pretending that Europe is likely to offer a different deal, or that some lethal enigma called \u201cNo Deal\u201d could be driven through against the wishes of parliament. We must acknowledge that the Conservatives do not have a majority in parliament, that the wrong Brexit would have a devastating impact on Northern Ireland and Scotland\u2019s place in the union, and that high European tariffs would destroy our agriculture and threaten the jobs of the million people who work in our automotive and aeronautic sectors. I would bridge the gap between the referendum result and parliament through a citizens\u2019 assembly, a grand jury, which would help the public to focus on the practical details, take the party politics out, and define again for parliament not the \u201cwhat\u201d of Brexit but the \u201chow\u201d. But I am not pretending parliament is anything other than it is, or that any policy, including mine, is guaranteed to work \u2013 merely that this is the best, the fastest, and indeed the only chance of getting Brexit done. And I am a Conservative who is prudent about finance. I won\u2019t commit to \u201cturn on the spending taps\u201d, or put \u00a340bn into a single department, or to cut taxes alongside a no-deal Brexit. Such promises risk destroying the Conservative party\u2019s reputation for economic competence. Instead, I would use the money available to invest in education and in the infrastructure, from broadband to rail lines, that will transform productivity \u2013 particularly in the north. I would borrow to build 2 million more houses. But I would only borrow against marketable assets like houses \u2013 which the government can then rent out or sell. I would invest in research and development in British universities to develop the solar technology of the future. I would introduce a universal National Citizens Service for 16-year-olds focused on community projects. I would work with other parties on a national plan to fund social care. But I would not spend money we do not have. The grand optimism of politicians is too often a cover for deep pessimism \u2013 an uneasiness in the face of a difficult world and a struggle to believe in the practical steps necessary to improve it. But what I discovered as the deputy-governor in Iraq, or setting up a charity in Afghanistan, was the same thing that I learnt as the flooding or prisons minister: the more you acknowledge real problems and real constraints, the more remarkable the change. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you are clearing 30,000 truck-loads of garbage out of the old city of Kabul, or making Britain lead the world in its approach to the environment and the climate cataclysm: what matters is facing reality \u2013 and having the determination and energy to force change through.
