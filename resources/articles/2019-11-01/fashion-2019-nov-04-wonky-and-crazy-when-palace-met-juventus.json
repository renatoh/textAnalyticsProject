So when Juventus, the Italian home of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianluigi Buffon, invited the brand to design their 2019/2020 season kit, it was a dream come true. \u201cIt was amazing and crazy,\u201d says Tanju. \u201cThey are an iconic football team and have some of my favourite players.\u201d Palace has long graduated from Tanju\u2019s basement; still independent, it now has four stand-alone stores, concessions in Dover Street Market, and a reported turnover of \u00a325m. it is a skate brand that sells streetwear, turning it out in weekly \u201cdrops\u201d, responding to its customers\u2019 appetite for newness and novelty (while also giving rise to a healthy cottage industry in the re-sale market). Its in-house style is irreverent and often pokes fun at the fashion system that it is, nevertheless, a part of, having collaborated with Ralph Lauren, Adidas, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac and Reebok. A partnership on this level \u2013 a 10-year-old skate brand and one of the oldest and greatest Serie A football teams has never taken place before. It\u2019s both brave unexpected, yet there is an authenticity to it. Palace is unique in the way it is positioned\u2013 cool, underground and elusive, but with the oomph of brand 10 times it\u2019s size. It is hard to imagine any other label pulling this collaboration off. The collection for Juventus includes three kits in two different colour ways, two tracksuits, a jacket, training tops, baseball caps, a beanie, a sports bag, gloves, scarves and a football (which, sadly, won\u2019t be used in games). The on-pitch kit has Juventus\u2019s iconic stripes fading into an eye-melting op-art black-and-white check, punctuated with the sponsor\u2019s logos in fluorescent green. It nods to the fact that the British football fan\u2019s style was inspired by Italian brands from the 1980s, and sits on the intersectional point for skatewear, football and leisure culture. \u201cThe design process was really working out how to make it Juventus, but with a Palace edge \u2013 a bit wonky and crazy,\u201d says Tanju. \u201cOur designer, Nugget, brought a lot to the table, referencing 90s football gear, beanies and bag.\u201d The small team at Palace is closer than family, and they all love what they do, says Tanju. \u201cI\u2019ve known my business partner for 20 years; I used to skate with him,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no guy in a suit looking over our shoulders saying we can\u2019t do something because it didn\u2019t sell. We make things we want to make.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
