In 1996, her first appointment as a Methodist probationer minister was as the curate in a deprived Anglican parish in Grimsby. Later, as chair of the Leeds Methodist district, she developed community projects and lobbied government, particularly about conditions in immigration detention centres. Described as a woman of \u201cwarmth and wisdom, clarity of mind and a deeply empathetic spirit\u201d, Liz approached her ministry, and indeed every sphere of her life, with enthusiasm, love and compassion. She was sometime president of the West Yorkshire ecumenical council; co-chair of the joint safeguarding working group of the Methodist church and the Church of England; a governor of the Queen\u2019s Foundation, Birmingham; and an ecumenical honorary canon of Wakefield Cathedral. Born in Camborne, Cornwall, Liz was the second of three daughters of Barbara (nee Marshall), a post office counter clerk, and Alan Stevens, who worked as a railway booking clerk at Camborne after leaving the RAF. Educated at College Street Church of England infants school and Camborne grammar, she studied ancient and medieval history at University College London. There she met Peter Smith, a research student in chemical engineering; they married in 1978. Local preaching studies, begun at home, were influenced by her experience in the West London Mission, led by the socialist peer Donald Soper. Throughout the 1980s and early 90s, in Chester, Birkenhead and Grimsby, Liz ran or helped to establish schemes for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. For many years she was secretary of the Alliance of Radical Methodists. In 1992, Liz began training for the ordained ministry but on completion was rejected by the local Methodist circuit as a radical. After the curacy, Liz was a superintendent minister in rural Lincolnshire, where she came to empathise with farmers trying to work the land in a difficult economic climate. Awarded her PhD by the University of Nottingham in 2007 for a study of women\u2019s liberative learning in the church, she then moved to Leeds, where her priority as chair of district was to support ministers and their families. As a committed feminist, Liz was particularly encouraging of women in ministry and leadership, but her vocation was all about enabling people, including herself, to become more fully human. Liz was an optimist who, in Charles Wesley\u2019s phrase, lived \u201cto serve the present age\u201d. She is survived by Peter and her children, Alexis, Imogen and me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
