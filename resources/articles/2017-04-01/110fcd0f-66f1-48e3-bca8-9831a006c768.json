Boro have not won a league match since mid-December and now sit seven points behind Hull, albeit with a game in hand. For Silva\u2019s side, though, there is renewed hope after Swansea\u2019s late defeat to Tottenham, a result that pulls City out of the bottom three for the first time since October. If they do achieve salvation this season, Hull\u2019s home form will have been the key. Just a few months back and this stadium was echoing with chants against the owners, but Silva\u2019s turning of the tide in such a short space of time has been a remarkable achievement. The goals were spread across the team \u2013 coming from Lazar Markovic, Oumar Niasse, Abel Hern\u00e1ndez and Harry Maguire \u2013 and although Boro were a more potent attacking force than in recent weeks, their first-half efforts from \u00c1lvaro Negredo and Marten de Roon papered over the cracks of a weak defensive display which frustrated the caretaker manager, Steve Agnew. Silva, the Hull head coach, said the performance was the finest since he joined the club. \u201cI think it is our best game, we started fast with a good intensity. We controlled all the first half. We had a very good reaction [to their goal],\u201d added the Portuguese. \u201cIt\u2019s important, but nothing is finished tonight. It\u2019s a big fight until the end of the season, I don\u2019t doubt that. But [it\u2019s good] when I look to the table and see our different position.\u201d Middlesbrough had not scored an away league goal this year before this crucial game and the five goals shared between the two sides in the first half \u2013 the most in any Premier League game this season \u2013 were therefore a shock to most inside the KCom Stadium. In the fifth minute neat interplay from Rudy Gestede and Negredo down the left was followed by a fine first-time through-ball from the Spaniard to Adama Traor\u00e9. The winger jinked into the penalty area and waited, with the chance seemingly gone, before scuffing a low shot towards the far post that the onrushing Negredo steered into an empty net. The Hull equaliser nine minutes later was provided by Markovic, his first goal for the club since joining on loan from Liverpool, a simple prod home from inside the six-yard box after Niasse had headed a deflected cross towards goal and Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s initial effort was blocked by Ben Gibson. They looked a threat whenever they came forward and were ahead in the 27th minute through Niasse, demonstrating the kind of sharpness that has made him a key part of the Tigers\u2019 recent renaissance by finishing swiftly following a flicked header by Hern\u00e1ndez. Soon Hern\u00e1ndez himself was on the scoresheet and Hull seemed in complete control. Maguire played a precise ball from deep to Kamil Grosicki and the Poland winger drove forward before squaring for the Uruguay striker to finish into a gaping net. Eldin Jakupovic brilliantly tipped Gestede\u2019s header onto the crossbar before Agnew\u2019s side controversially pulled one back. Gibson helped on a corner and De Roon was clearly in an offside position when he nodded past Jakupovic but the goal was given after a consultation between the officials. But Middlesbrough\u2019s hopes were dashed with 20 minutes remaining and, yet again, their defending was poor. Andrew Robertson whipped in a deep free-kick from the left towards Maguire at the back post and with the Boro rearguard looking to play offside, the Hull defender ghosted in unmarked and nodded past V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s. Agnew said: \u201cThat\u2019s not like us to concede goals like we did. We didn\u2019t get the balance right, in trying to win the game we became too open. We did give it a go, but we were far too open. Within the game, the disappointment was the goals we conceded. The goals weren\u2019t just the [fault of] the backline. We conceded poor goals. \u201cAfter the game it was silent and you\u2019d expect that. But we have to stay with it, dust ourselves down tomorrow morning and prepare for Burnley.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
