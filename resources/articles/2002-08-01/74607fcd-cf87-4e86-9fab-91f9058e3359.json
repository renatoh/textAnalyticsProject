We cuddled cold bottles of Black Label beer and hot dogs on paper plates until the boys on the drums burst into action with a rendition of Amajoba. Our inhibitions slid to the floor alongside crumpled plates and we jumped up with the rest of the crowd as the drums rolled on and on into the night. The next morning an ample orange sun burned through the smoke haze of the township and into our bedroom at Ma Neos' B&amp;B. Kaftaned and turbaned, Mama Thandi (her daughter is Neo) presided over the laden breakfast table, an exemplary example of \"ubuntu\". Ask 10 Africans what it means, and you'll get 10 different answers, but there's no mistaking ubuntu when you experience it. It's an African umbrella term for generosity of spirit, humanity and warmth that rubs the sharp edges off your city soul. South African township tourism is gearing up for the World Summit on Sustainable Development, to be held in Johannesburg from August 26-September 4, and summit delegates are in for the full ubuntu treatment. If you are planning an independent visit to South Africa, here is a selection of what townships in Gauteng - the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria - and Cape Town offer. One word of warning: do not venture into the townships by yourself, many roads and venues are not signposted and only the main arterial routes are surfaced. Book a township guide, who will add huge value to your visit with local anecdotes, and an introduction to township characters. Alexandra Bordering some of the wealthiest suburbs in South Africa's richest city, Johannesburg, 350,000 people live in shacks that tumble down the hillside, spread across a floodplain, nestle under power lines and sprawl alongside and even into roads. Yet at the heart of this township, where more than 60% are unemployed and the average household income is between R1,000 and R3,000 per month, beats a vibrant urban culture of art and music. The one-roomed house where Nelson Mandela moved in with the Xhoma family at 46 Seventh Avenue in 1941 still stands and, although it is occupied, it does admit visitors if arranged with a tour guide. Alex-San Kopano (c/o 12th and Selborne Streets, + 011 882 0673) is a multi-resource centre with a library, markets and the local radio station, Alex FM. The Triple S Sports Bar (+ 072 301 4433, Shop No.9, Alexgate Centre, Old Pretoria Main Road) is a tavern which resounds to live jazz over weekends. Soweto For most people, this name is synonymous with townships. On June 16 this year, the Hector Pieterson Memorial and museum was opened, in memory of the 13-year-old schoolboy shot by the police during the Soweto uprising - he was just one of the 566 people who died on that day in 1976. From the square, the Freedom Trail follows the tree-lined Vilakazi Street towards Mandela's former home (open 9am-5pm) and the nearby home of Archbishop Desmond Tutu (not open to the public) . It is the only street in the world able to lay claim to two Nobel peace-prizewinners. Next door to Tutu's house is Sakhumzi Restaurant (+ 083 337 6925) , which specialises in Soweto cuisine such as tripe and samp, the latter being a staple maize dish. Further down the road is the world famous Wandi's Place (+ 011 982 2796) . CWJ The initials stand for the Soweto precinct of Central-Western Jabavu, where gold magnate Sir Ernest Oppenheimer built the eponymous tower in 1957 with bricks salvaged from the demolished Sophiatown, and which offers impressive all-round views of the vast urban sprawl that is Soweto. Nearby, the traditional round huts constructed by world renowned healer Credo Muthwa are being rebuilt after they were demolished during the 1976 Soweto uprising. Morris Isaacson High School in CWJ was where the uprising was planned, and many teachers still recall the historic events (visits can be arranged through a guide) . Atteridgeville In the past few years, Pretoria has managed to shake off the civil servant mentality that goes with being the administrative capital, helped largely by the influx of returning worldly political exiles. The township of Atteridgeville is home to the De Beers-sponsored Vukani Ubuntu (+ 012 373 9849, Mon-Fri 8-4.30, Sat 9am-12pm, Atteridgeville Technical College campus) where African inspired diamond and gold jewellery is made and sold. Ekhaya E'pitoli (+ 082 837 9238, 121 Thindisa Street, Atteridgeville) is a popular restaurant and music venue that houses the work of local artists and holds African poetry readings. It is run by the six-feet-tall Statue Mojapelo. Thembisa The flight path to Johannesburg International goes directly over the township, which lies east of the city. The Friday night jazz sessions at View Guesthouse and Tavern (+ 082 599 2487, 17 Aluta Crescent) are not to be missed. Good planning would include staying the night at one of 10 comfortable rooms in the guesthouse. Proprietor Sheila Sekhitla is happy to show guests interesting sites around the township, such as the home of the late African jazz pioneer Moses Molelekwa, and the air-conditioned double-storey corrugated iron shack in the Winnie Mandela squatter camp. Langa Situated in Cape Town, Langa is the oldest township in South Africa - 150 years old in 2002 - and boasts its own \"waterfront\", named after a row of dusty palm trees at the southern end. As you enter the township, an empty piece of land bordered by the freeway, a power station, sewage works and a church is dotted with the huts of Xhosa boys undergoing their manhood initiation. At the Tsoga Environmental Resource Centre (+ 021 694 0004, Washington Street) , funky handbags and hats are manufactured from waste materials. Next door, the brightly painted Guga S' Thebe cultural centre pounds to the rhythm of school children rehearsing dance routines. It also houses a welding skills workshop, photography darkrooms and sewing rooms. Beading, wrought-iron work and clothing are sold at the centre (+ 021 695 3328, Mon-Fri 8-6) . Khayelitsha By far the biggest township in Cape Town, Khayelitsha has more than 600,000 residents. Walk up Lookout Hill (Mew Road) for the wraparound views of the township and Table mountain, 15 miles away and a universe removed. Visit Mr Golden (+ 021 365 1976) , an inspiring artist who in a fit of despair one day kicked a soft drink can and got the bright idea of making flowers out of them. Pop into Egugu le'Afrika (+ 0824238 479) for lunch, where Abraham Bokwe, who worked as a chef in Cape Town for many years, took the plunge and started his own zebra-striped restaurant on not much more than a shoestring and some second-hand chairs. Give Me Hope, Johanna was a song about the South African democracy struggle, and Zenzele (+ 021 361 1840) is a training and development centre that offers even the most hardened cynic hope for the future of this country. Sewing, woodwork and welding skills are taught while at a neighbouring light industrial hive, graduating entrepreneurs have set up in business. Lwandle On the False Bay coast, Lwandle is a township that was established to house migrant workers. Its migrant labour museum (+ 021 845 6119, Mon-Fri 9.30am - 4pm) documents the stifling restrictions that resulted in fines and a criminal record when wives slept over. Today, Lwandle is a model township where children play on safe streets, hawkers sell clothing on the corners and a library helps to improve literacy skills. Hostel 33, with its shoebox accommodation for single men, was conserved as a reminder of the lot of migrant workers. At the Good Food Foundation (+ 021 397 9216, Vanguard Drive, Mitchell's Plain) , organic vegetables are cultivated in tidy patches, on a vacant piece of land.
