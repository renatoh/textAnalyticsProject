For the first time since 1997 every Premiership manager who started the season is still in a job by the middle of October, raising the possibility that for only the third time in the history of the division, there will be no managerial changes until the new year. It is in stark contrast to last season when Paul Sturrock and Sir Bobby Robson were dismissed in August and five more desks were cleared before the turn of the year. Against that backdrop David Moyes, Mick McCarthy and Steve Bruce, all with teams currently in the bottom three, might well breathe a sigh of relief. It is a change welcomed by John Barnwell, chief executive of the League Managers' Association. \"I don't think [chairman] have suddenly become more sympathetic to the manager and more understanding to the role,\" he said. \"It's simply driven by finance. Some of the managers' contracts are a lot larger and the financial climate is not as flexible as it was in the Premiership two or three years ago. Then, the thinking was, 'We might sack him before the end of the season; oh, goodness me, it's going to cost us a fortune; let's give him a month and see how it goes', but now it's a couple of months, even three before they do that.\" History, however, shows that the biggest hurdle lies ahead. More Premiership managers have departed in November than any other month. Moyes, at Everton, as with McCarthy at Sunderland, is likely to get further time, and Bruce, though enduring a testing period, retains the faith of the Birmingham board. \"We pick [managers] carefully and we are loyal to our people,\" said David Gold, the club's co-owner. \"And if you are having a bad run, as we are, you are all in it together whether it's the manager, the players or the board. Looking for a scapegoat is not our way.\" Another reason for the managerial merry-go-round coming to a standstill is the quality of replacements. Former Premiership managers out of work include Peter Reid, whose star has fallen after failing at Leeds and Coventry, and Robson. Other options are looking overseas or delving into the Football League - something that happens too rarely, according to Barnwell - though Gold is not enthused about the current batch of Championship managers. \"You don't say, 'Wow, I want that manager to come to my football club',\" he said. \"But you would have said that last season with Mick McCarthy.\" Few Premiership chairman would have said the same about Alan Pardew but West Ham's decision to stand by their manager has been vindicated. Patience, though, is not always the best policy. \"You could make a case that clubs in the past have taken too long,\" said Gold. \"I think [Glenn] Roeder was an example of that.\" Bruce need not break into a sweat. \"I would put my house on it,\" Gold added, \"that Steve, Mick McCarthy and David Moyes will be with their clubs for the foreseeable future.\" It is a big house, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
