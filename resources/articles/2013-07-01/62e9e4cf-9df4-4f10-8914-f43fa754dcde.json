But local marketing officials appear to have gone too far when they boasted of defying economic recession and creating new jobs. They were challenged by an irate resident, Steven Haywood, who argued that the promotion \"contains blatant untruths\", and his complaint was upheld by South Africa's advertising standards authority, which ordered Johannesburg to stop running the claim. The decision comes as something of a blow to the 127-year-old city of gold which, though often described as the economic powerhouse of Africa and host to the world's biggest artificial forest, attracts significantly fewer tourists than its more naturally beautiful rival Cape Town. Haywood challenged a radio advert that urged listeners: \"Imagine a city where you can rest assured knowing that it is financially stable; that there is ongoing electrification of homes. A city that is saving the environment through different energy-efficient interventions. A city that continues to create new jobs despite the economic downturn. Can you imagine living in such a city? You do.\" The advert was misleading, Haywood argued, since the city's finances had received three consecutive qualified audits, authorities were struggling to repair roads and rubbish was often left uncollected. The unemployment rate in Johannesburg in 2012 was 24.5%, with most of its young people out of work. The advertising authority agreed and ruled that the commercial should be withdrawn immediately \"in its current form\". It ruled that the advert \"communicates a misleading message about the overall wellbeing of the respondent\". The authority held that Haywood's claims of \"financial instability\" were supported by a report from the auditor-general. \"The respondent has not disputed the allegation that it has received a qualified audit for three years in a row, that it runs high losses on, inter alia, electricity and water, or that its Pikitup service is bankrupt,\" it said. The city of Johannesburg has said it intends to appeal against the ruling. This year it unveiled a 100bn rand (\u00a36.65bn), 10-year infrastructure development plan, which includes housing and transport upgrades. But wealthy areas such as Sandton continue to sit cheek-by-jowl with impoverished, rat-infested townships such as Alexandra."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
