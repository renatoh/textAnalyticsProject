Gimme Some is, accordingly, a pop record through and through \u2013 albeit a spiky one in places, unsettled by the aggressive guitars of (Don't Let Them) Cool Off and surprisingly abrasive lyrics to Black Book (\"Your music sounds like shit\") and Breaker Breaker. Even at its most jagged, however, Gimme Some comes across as power-pop by numbers, the effortlessness with which the Swedish trio spin cheerful melodies and ineffable hooks making almost every song sound uncomfortably derivative. The grand exception is the opening track, Tomorrow Has to Wait: its stark, stamped rhythm and Peter Moren's lip-chewing vocal are as arresting as they are apparently simple \u2013 and threaten to dominate the summer much the way the cutesy whistling of PBJ's breakthrough 2006 single Young Folks did."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
