He was chair of the deputy prime minister's urban task force in 1998-99 but is now adviser to the mayor of London. In the same article we said that a letter from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to Kensington and Chelsea borough council had been \"leaked\" to the Architectural Journal. It had been seen by the journal but was technically a public document. Rather than actively approving the design for the hospital, as we suggested, John Prescott did not \"call in\" the plans and so allowed the council's decision to stand. We referred in a leader to \"A report ... published by nutritionists condemning them [children], yet again, for refusing to eat up their greens\" (A cunning plan, page 21, June 6). The authors of the report wish us to point out that they are not nutritionists, but health psychologists funded by Cancer Research UK, and that the purpose of the report is not to condemn children for their unhealthy choices but to document those choices so that strategies for improving diet can be scientifically informed. Marina Lewycka, author of A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian and winner of the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize for comic fiction, teaches at Sheffield Hallam University and not at Sheffield University, as we said in error in a news report, Happy as a pig in ... first novel scoops Wodehouse prize, page 7, June 6. Michael Thomas scored the deciding goal that won the league championship for Arsenal at Anfield in 1989, not 1988 as we stated in a report headlined Arsenal fans flock to developer's offer of a home match, page 5, June 13.
