As reactions go \u2013 as tackles go too, if Keane\u2019s infamous lunge can be called that \u2013 it could hardly have been more different to that of Son Heung-Min, who broke down in tears after Andr\u00e9 Gomes broke his ankle last week. On Wednesday night, Son dedicated his opening goal against Red Star Belgrade to the Everton midfielder. \u201cI\u2019m so sad this happened and that I was involved with this situation. I feel really, really sorry about this accident,\u201d he said. Be clear: Gomes is the victim, unable to return to playing for a long time, if at all. But Son\u2019s reaction was a reminder that for players involved in serious injuries it is not always so easy to walk away. There\u2019s guilt, even if there is no blame, a backlash, a desperation to atone in some small, insufficient way. John Fashanu, who fractured Gary Mabbutt\u2019s skull, leaving him with horrific injuries, says Ryan Giggs sent signed pictures when an accidental collision ended his career. Although, asked if injuring a player is hard to live with, Fashanu also responds bluntly: \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world, don\u2019t blow it out of proportion: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to commit suicide, I can\u2019t eat all day.\u2019 No.\u201d Yet live with it, many must. For a lot of players, that moment never goes away entirely. Even Keane had to revisit it, not just unable to walk away in the end but actually walking back into it. He claimed the ghost writer of his autobiography, Eamon Dunphy, had taken \u201cartistic licence\u201d when describing the scene as more like an assault than an attempt to win the ball. It was, he and Roddy Doyle wrote in a subsequent book, as if he had \u201ckilled someone\u201d. Not that he showed contrition: this was about responsibility, rather than regret. Son\u2019s remorse was clear immediately. He was shocked by what he saw. Some injuries can\u2019t be unseen. One of the lasting images of Coventry City\u2019s David Busst suffering a broken leg at Old Trafford, shin bone puncturing his calf, soaking the turf in blood, is Peter Schmeichel walking away horrified, unable to look. The goalkeeper later admitted: \u201cEveryone went numb.\u201d The Korean\u2019s reaction also recalled the broken leg suffered by Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a defender Manuel Pablo. As he looked down following a tackle with Celta Vigo\u2019s Everton Giovanella in a Galician derby, Manuel Pablo said he saw his leg \u201changing there\u201d, as if on a hinge. Giovanella did too, head in his hands, tears streaming. Still crying, afterwards he said: \u201cI want him to know I never, ever, meant this; if I could swap places with him, I would.\u201d Two days later, Giovanella travelled 160km for a hospital visit. \u201cHe was in a bad way,\u201d he said. And he here is Manuel Pablo \u2013 it was Giovanella in a state, just as it was Everton players heading to the Spurs dressing room to console Son. Giovanella and Manuel Pablo became friends; for others, it is different. Shaka Hislop recalls visiting Pier Luigi Casiraghi at a King\u2019s Cross hospital after an accidental clash which ended the Italian\u2019s career. Casiraghi was happy to see Hislop. His wife, though, wasn\u2019t. \u201cShe held me to blame. I understand that, as a significant other, that\u2019s how you see things,\u201d the former West Ham goalkeeper says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t blame me. I said I hoped to see him on the field soon, but that never came to pass.\u201d And then there is Andoni Goikoetxea, who broke Diego Maradona\u2019s ankle in 1983. He told the Observer: \u201cEvery time I talk, I get the feeling I\u2019m having to defend myself again,\u201d he says. Just this call, 36 years on, is proof it never goes away entirely. \u201cIt was a tough tackle in a place I shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d he admits. \u201cAfter the game, Barcelona\u2019s V\u00edctor Munoz said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad.\u2019 But that night, our coach, Javier Clemente, told us. It was a hammer blow. I knew what was coming. You try to sleep, you can\u2019t. I spoke to him, called him. I had a bad time, so did my family. It was hell at home: the press came, the phone rang constantly, I had to leave for three weeks. \u201cWhen he joined Sevilla a few years later, I spoke to their press officer and asked him to arrange a meeting. We met for a coffee, chatted, talked about the family. I don\u2019t remember the chat well; I\u2019m not even sure we talked about the injury.\u201d Everyone else did. \u201cThe first game after in France, they seemed disappointed that I wasn\u2019t the devil with a forked tail. I went to England and the Sun\u2019s front page called me The Butcher of Bilbao. \u201cNot long ago, the Times said Mr Goikoetxea is the most violent man in sporting history. I don\u2019t recognise myself in that description. It doesn\u2019t hurt, I don\u2019t care, but it is unfair. I was an international, played for 16 years, scored more goals than any defender in Athletic\u2019s history: 44. And people think all I ever did was injure Maradona; they only know me because of him. Years later, I\u2019m still talking about it.\u201d Yeah, sorry about that. Goikoetxea placed the boots he was wearing in a glass case, like a trophy in a cabinet. \u201cBut it\u2019s not what people think,\u201d he insists. \u201cI wore those boots in two games. One is the Maradona game and the other is Lech Poznan in the European Cup four days later. It was a special game. I\u2019d just been given a long ban, we\u2019d been handed the trophy for the previous season\u2019s league title, I scored the first, we won 4-0, came back from a 2-0 in the first leg, and my teammates carried me off on their shoulders \u2013 which I\u2019d never seen before. They knew my emotional state, how hard it had been. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to play for a long time and I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to keep these boots\u2019. They have a huge sentimental value; they\u2019re a symbol, a powerful message. They\u2019re what football is: sadness and happiness, good and bad, the beautiful and the ugly. Those boots are football.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
