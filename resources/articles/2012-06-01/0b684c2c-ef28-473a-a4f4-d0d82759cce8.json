She is warm, ebullient and modest. But in her writing there is sometimes a waspish edge, a certain contempt for many of her characters, a hint of a deep disapproval of the world and its follies. There she sits in her comfortable and rather grand, newly acquired house in Holland Park, a benign, intelligent and considerate woman in her mid-sixties. As with the other lady writers of her genre, it is hard to imagine blood seeping out from behind her sofa, or corpses draped over her Chippendale. Perhaps that is precisely why so many staid and respectable middle-class Englishwomen have taken to fictional murder. It is a remarkable fact that women writers should have been the best and the bestselling detective story writers since Wilkie Collins invented the genre \u2013 Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, Patricia Highsmith, Margery Allingham, Emma Lathen, Ruth Rendell and many others. Perhaps it only took Agatha Christie's extraordinary success to convince other women that you didn't need to know anything about life outside the drawing room to invent crimes and plot their solutions. American crime novels are written by men \u2013 hard-bitten, macho, super-cool, gritty tales set in the mean streets among low criminals, rooted in a world where real crimes happen. But most English detective fiction has stayed in a realm of quite extraordinary fantasy, firmly set among the middle classes, on the uncomfortable presumption, perhaps, that the lower classes are too boring to write books about, or that crime among them is too common to merit attention. Or perhaps it is just that these women like to imagine what a little murder can do to the deadly dullness of a vicarage tea party. PD James hates to be compared to Agatha Christie \u2013 \"Such a bad writer\" \u2013 and indeed they have little in common. The one she admires is Dorothy L. Sayers, though PD James is less exuberant, more sombre and far more scientific in her approach. Most British crime writers are indelibly suffused with a peculiar English snobbery. They sound a trumpeting note that declares the author's own social and cultural superiority. Perhaps crime writing is regarded as such a low-down art form that they feel obliged to retrieve their reputations with florid and knowing descriptions of the most tasteful old books, furniture, buildings and aristocrats, emphasising the higher sensibilities of their heroes. Ever since Agatha Christie, snobbery has become an integral part of the creaking old detective story formula \u2013 but it's a formula that gives a lot of us a great deal of inexplicably silly pleasure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
