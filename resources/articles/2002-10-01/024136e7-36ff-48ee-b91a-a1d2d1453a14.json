Notoriously meticulous, Small has never been a soft touch for anyone but he has never assembled a sequence against top-quality opposition to match the first four frames against Higgins in which he made breaks of 58, 71, 58 and 100, a period in which Higgins potted only five balls. \"Finally I've done it,\" said the world No29 from Leith. \"I keep threatening good performances against great players and it's nice to let everyone know how good a player I am.\" Earlier this year Small thought his career would be ended by injury. \"I couldn't twist my neck up far enough to see the cue ball,\" he said, \"but injections worked wonders.\" The fable of the hare and the tortoise, nevertheless, comes to mind in contemplating his quarter-final against the dashing world No1 Ronnie O'Sullivan, who had to recover from 3-1 down to beat Nottingham's Michael Holt, the world No35. In his brisk, attractive style, Holt compiled frame-clinchers of 45, 74 and 67. O'Sullivan's 71 gave him the third frame but his frustration was evident from the way he flipped the pink off the table as he departed for the intermission. Perhaps this 20 minutes gave Holt too much time to contemplate the immensity of what lay within his grasp. He began to miss and O'Sullivan, with 113 his heaviest contribution, prevailed with a four-frame winning streak. \"I struggled with my game and some little mannerisms Michael has got, pulling faces and patting the table,\" said O'Sullivan. \"Then I realised he wasn't doing it to wind me up. It's just the way he is and I should be above letting that kind of thing bother me.\" Paul Hunter overcame Stephen Hendry for only the second time in six attempts, going to 2-0 with a break of 112, to 3-1 with a 66 and to 4-2 with a 60. The decisive factor, though, was Hunter's tactical play. Hendry has never liked fragmentary frames and several times impatiently overplayed his hand. He managed to win a scrappy seventh but an even scrappier eighth left Hunter a 5-3 winner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
