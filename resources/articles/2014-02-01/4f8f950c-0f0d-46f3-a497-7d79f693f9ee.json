Premiership Rugby and Regional Rugby Wales have signed a head of agreement and one of their options is an Anglo-Welsh league. The regions have been told that relegation is non-negotiable, but they see the guaranteed income that they would have through the BT Sport television deal would be worth the risk. The regions would start with a central income of more than \u00a32m, working upwards to \u00a33m by the end of the five-year contract. They receive \u00a32.9m from the tournaments they currently play in, but with no European Cup agreed and with various deals in the RaboDirect Pro12 in a state of flux, and the Italians considering pulling out, that is anything but guaranteed. Both Premiership Rugby and the regions are angry that the latest instalment of money from European Rugby Cup Ltd, the organisers of the Heineken Cup that the two groups have pledged to have nothing to do with from the end of the season, has been delayed. It was due last week. ERC's board meets on Wednesday and no money will be released. The regions are due \u00a3200,000 each and some of their owners have had to guarantee wages. Their director on the board, Stuart Gallacher, stood down six weeks ago and the regions \u2013 having decided the position should lie fallow \u2013 are set to appoint someone else. \"We have been given no reason for the delay,\" said one regional official. \"We are being told that there is no reason why ERC should not continue to run the European Cup, but this hardly makes a case for that argument.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
