In Boris Johnson's corner, we have Lynton Crosby, a man credited with winning four successive terms for the Australian Liberal party. Now, Brian Paddick's team has hired Rick Ridder, a Denver-based strategist who worked with presidential contender Howard Dean in the early, mould-breaking months of his 2003 campaign and recently delivered an unexpected victory to Hillary Clinton in Arizona. If the campaigns have to look beyond Britain for professional help, perhaps this is because English political life is still disarmingly amateurish. Many MPs still run their constituencies as mom-and-pop operations, employing relatives as secretaries (no doubt why Derek Conway's abuse of the system went undetected for so long). Research jobs in the Commons are regarded as entry-level positions: many are unpaid interns. Key campaigning roles, such as election agent, are filled by local volunteers. Speechwriters, marketers, even pollsters, often work pro bono. The few well-paid professionals like Andy Coulson, and other communication directors for the Conservatives, tend to be ex-journalists; proof, perhaps, that political campaigning remains uni-dimensional in the UK and too focused on the news press. There are a handful of political jobs with lobbyists or thinktanks, it is true, but these are tiny operations compared with K Street in Washington. The fact is, British politics are fairly poverty-stricken and the parties must use their funds carefully, targeting specific campaigns. It seems, when they do, they look abroad for a competitive edge. The Crosby v Ridder contest is interesting because it is a rematch. Crosby worked on Michael Howard's 2005 Conservative campaign. Ridder filled the same role for Charles Kennedy's Liberal Democrats. The result was inconclusive. The Tory share of the vote remained pretty much where it had been for a decade, yet they won 33 new seats and had a net gain of two over the Liberal Democrats. Ming Campbell's forthcoming autobiography - punchily entitled My Autobiography - reveals how disappointed the party were with the result: though they had a net gain of 11 seats and increased their share of the vote by almost 4%, it was felt they had missed a real chance, given the general unpopularity of the Iraq war and the very specific dislike of Michael Howard. Both Crosby and Ridder have their own companies, Crosby-Textor and RBI Strategies and Research respectively. The Tories and Lib Dems credit both men with lifting spirits and improving organisation. Crosby is said to be down-to-earth and witty, though he has been accused of dirty tricks. Ridder is described as a calm, positive voice. He has also been compared to Columbo: I don't know if this is an accusation of dirty macs. How they will affect the campaign for London mayor is still unclear. The BoJo team have been happy to sit back and let the Evening Standard dismantle Ken Livingstone's campaign. Brian Paddick has proved level-headed, but his big launches are yet to come. As an ex-Met commander, his pledge to cut crime by 50% is eye-catching, but he is waiting until April to announce how he will do it. Then there is the Paddick autobiography, due out soon. Barack Obama's memoirs ignited his presidential campaign: may be the Audacity of Brian will do the same in London. Whatever happens, Crosby and Ridder are likely to be around for longer. The London mayor campaign is shaping up to be a dry run for the general election, and the signs are that Crosby and Ridder will be on board: their third time together in the ring.
