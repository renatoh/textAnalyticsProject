The fossil fuel corporation has confirmed it is not renewing its corporate membership deals with the Southbank Centre and the British Film Institute (BFI) when they come up for renewal later this year. Campaigners say the decision underlines the shrinking \u201csocial licence\u201d of fossil fuel companies in the midst of the climate crisis. It follows similar moves by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), National Theatre and National Galleries Scotland, which have all severed ties with major oil companies in the last year. Chris Garrard, from the campaign group Culture Unstained, said the end of Shell\u2019s involvement with the BFI and the Southbank Centre was a crucial milestone in the campaign. \u201cFrom its HQ on the South Bank, Shell has pursued a business plan that has trampled indigenous people\u2019s rights and pushed the world deeper into climate crisis,\u201d said Garrard. \u201cMeanwhile, it has sponsored its cultural neighbours as part of a cynical attempt to deflect attention from the damage it was causing. But the show is over for Shell.\u201d A spokesperson for Shell said the decision not to renew the contracts had been taken last year and mutually agreed with the Southbank and the BFI. \u201cLast year we decided not to renew annual memberships with the BFI or the Southbank Centre, collectively worth around \u00a320,000, when they expire later this year,\u201d it said. The BFI confirmed it had been Shell\u2019s decision. Harriet Finney, the BFI\u2019s director of external affairs, said the institute was \u201ccommitted to supporting a sustainable future\u201d. \u201cWe are in the process of reviewing the impact of our own activities across all our sites; how we can better support the UK\u2019s screen industries to move towards sustainable practice and how we respond culturally to the climate and ecological emergency.\u201d The Southbank Centre has had a relationship with Shell stretching back to 2006 and lists the company as a partner on its website. A spokesperson said the decision to end the two-year corporate membership had been mutual and declined to comment further. The leading tenor Mark Padmore, who will perform at the Royal Festival Hall in October, said he was delighted with Shell\u2019s decision. \u201cToday, more than ever, we all need to examine our way of life and the implications of our actions, as we respond to the growing climate emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking beautiful music does not excuse us from seeking to understand how our work is funded and asking questions about the kind of unsustainable businesses those partnerships might promote.\u201d Last year, the actor Mark Rylance resigned as an associate artist with the RSC after 30 years over its sponsorship deal with BP, arguing it allowed the company to \u201cobscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d. A few months later, the RSC announced it was cutting its links to BP after a \u201ccareful and often difficult debate\u201d internally. The latest move increases pressure on other arts institutions such as the British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and Science Museum Group, which have all faced criticism over their oil sponsorship deals in the past 18 months. Last month, the activist theatre group BP or not BP? occupied the British Museum for three days, sneaking a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d into the courtyard and staging a mass protest in the museum involving 1,500 people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
