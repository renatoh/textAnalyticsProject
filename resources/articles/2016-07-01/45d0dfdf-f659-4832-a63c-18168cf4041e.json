Labor\u2019s superannuation spokesman, Jim Chalmers, has already formed the opinion the $500,000 cap on non-concessional contributions is \u201cthe very definition of retrospectivity\u201d. But in a move calculated to inflame tensions in the Coalition over the changes, Chalmers called on the government to \u201ctake the time to get it right\u201d with an inquiry into whether they are retrospective, fair and workable. Chalmers told Radio National on Tuesday \u201cit\u2019s pretty hard to cop a view that something that is backdated and calculated from 2007 but not announced until 2016 is anything other than retrospective\u201d. \u201cPeople\u2019s retirement incomes shouldn\u2019t be messed with on a whim. You need to make sure that people are in the car \u2013 that they\u2019re consulted and that any changes are made really carefully.\u201d Chalmers noted the Coalition\u2019s division on superannuation and said the government \u201ccouldn\u2019t explain, couldn\u2019t defend and couldn\u2019t guarantee [the changes] would be in place, even if they won the election\u201d. The cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos has said the government has a mandate for the reforms and he would continue to advocate for them. But the immigration minister has warned the Coalition should not have a \u201ctin ear\u201d by ignoring concern over the changes. On Tuesday the Australian reported that the deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, warned Malcolm Turnbull and treasurer, Scott Morrison, the changes would provoke a backlash against the Coalition. Chalmers said Labor would support \u201canything that turns out to be workable and fair\u201d. \u201cIf it turns out if you look at all these changes in their totality, in isolation, and the way they interact with each other, if there\u2019s a case that can be made that they\u2019re workable and fair then we will support them.\u201d \u201cIf there are improvements which could be made, for example, if you could make that $500,000 cap prospective rather than retrospective, that\u2019s worth looking at.\u201d Chalmers also criticised the government\u2019s \u201cill-considered\u201d backpacker tax and said there was \u201cinternal dissent and chaos\u201d over whether to keep the tax after a six-month delay. Conservative think tank the Institute of Public Affairs ran an aggressive campaign against the superannuation changes because it believes they are retrospective. But experts including the Grattan Institute\u2019s John Daley and tax experts from the Australian National University, Miranda Stewart and David Ingles, have concluded the changes are not retrospective. Asked whether the right\u2019s David Feeney should keep his portfolio as shadow assistant minister for defence, Chalmers did nothing to hose down speculation of a reshuffle. He noted: \u201cBill Shorten is right to say there is an abundance of talent in the Labor party, we\u2019ve always got more good people than we have spots.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s David [Feeney] or anyone else on the frontbench, that\u2019s yet to be resolved.\u201d \u201cDavid [Feeney] himself said he didn\u2019t have the perfect campaign, I\u2019ve got a lot of time for [Feeney], he\u2019s one of our very good colleagues.\u201d Chalmers praised newly elected MPs Tim Hammond, Milton Dick and Anne Aly, amid speculation that Aly was jockeying to move into the shadow ministry after winning the seat of Cowan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
