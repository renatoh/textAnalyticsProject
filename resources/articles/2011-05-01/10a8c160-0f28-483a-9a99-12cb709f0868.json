In America, however, the television pundits were still wrestling with the reasons for the Geordie singer's \"failure to launch\". How, in a royal wedding year when the United States was supposed to have been swooning over all things English, was one of the old country's superstars deemed not good enough for primetime? Because for many observers, Cole \u2013 who made her first bouffant-haired appearance as a judge on the US show before the paparazzi just three weeks ago \u2013 was simply not up to scratch. And it was not, they said, just because of her north-east accent, which some claimed to be impossible for many viewers to understand. \"With enough production magic, you can go the Lily Allen route and 'Geordie' your way to indie supremacy,\" wrote Village Voice columnist Rohin Guha. Two productions featuring accents similar to Cole's \u2013 Billy Elliot the Musical and Lee Hall's play, the Pitmen Painters \u2013 have recently done well in New York and proved that pronunciation is not necessarily a barrier to success. Guha compared Cole's quick flop to Eliza Doolittle failing her \"rain in Spain moment\" in a way that he said could prove terminal for her career in America. \"She took herself too seriously from the start,\" he added. \"By forgoing the kitsch of her Girls Aloud days, she walked away from one of the few roads female British pop acts have into the American industry.\" Other commentators refused to rule out foul play. The news of Cole's dismissal from American X Factor leaked just as a rival talent show and music impresario Simon Cowell's previous brainchild, American Idol, was approaching its finale and ratings peak. \"It was extraordinary timing that the story of Cheryl Cole being fired blew up just as the American Idol season was peaking with the finale \u2013 though if anything Idol ratings were higher than expected,\" said Kelly Lynch, an editor at Hollywood-based television and celebrity news website Socialite Life. She added that the firing of Cole reflected badly on the Rupert Murdoch-owned television channel Fox, and left Cowell looking foolish. \"Simon Cowell is a wiseass and is putting all his effort into leaving American Idol in the dust. The X Factor is going to be a monster, so I'm surprised by this messy episode,\" she said. \"He was drumming up publicity for her [Cole] for the last six months and I thought it would work, that he was bringing us a little bit of his Britain \u2013 especially as we're all anglophiles this summer after the royal wedding. So to have Cole fired so abruptly I think has got to have been a business decision by Fox executives,\" said Lynch. Others cautioned that it was possible that there was no skulduggery, and that Fox had intended to announce Cole's firing last Thursday, after the Idol finale. Instead, the news was leaked to popular gossip website TMZ the day before. Fox will be airing both American Idol and The X Factor. Ratings for American Idol have dropped in the last few years, but the show remains the highest-rated TV series in the United States, and it has held that title since 2004-05. The online betting site Bookmaker has now given Idol a 90.9% chance of being the top-rated show next season in America, while The X Factor has only been given a 28.6% chance of being top in what will be its debut season. Cole's place on the judging panel of the US X Factor is now expected to be taken by former Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger. Cole, meanwhile, has reportedly already entered the next stage of her career, becoming a glamorous pawn in a ratings war between BBC1 and ITV. This weekend the 27-year-old singing star and talent show panellist was reportedly choosing between high-profile roles on Saturday night television shows for BBC1 or ITV1, although probably for a reduced fee. Insiders at her record company, Universal, have indicated they would prefer her to consider working on a new talent show in development for the BBC rather than returning to her judge's chair on the British version of The X Factor. The new show, called The Voice, is already a success in the US and has business connections with Universal, where UK boss David Joseph, who also runs the Brit Awards, is said to be hoping to steer her away from ITV and from Cowell. An employee of the record company reportedly confirmed yesterday that, \"Universal are heavily involved in recruiting judges for The Voice when it moves to the BBC and they are urging Cheryl to be the big star of that show,\" adding that the move would be \"a great way of sticking two fingers up at Simon Cowell\". On The Voice, the panel hears the auditions \"blind\" and rates the talent purely on their singing voices."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
