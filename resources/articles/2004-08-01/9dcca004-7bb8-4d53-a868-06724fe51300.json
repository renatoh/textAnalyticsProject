The IRB's chief executive Mike Miller had a telephone discussion with his Rugby Football Union counterpart Francis Baron yesterday in which he advised an official letter on the subject could be expected in the next few days. Until they have read the precise wording the RFU is declining to elaborate but it is understood the union is planning a \"front-foot response\" to an issue which has been simmering ever since the New Zealand Rugby Football Union suggested Woodward had breached the IRB's code of conduct at the press conference after the second Test in Auckland. Far from publicly rebuking Woodward for describing the early dismissal of Simon Shaw for kneeing as \"ridiculous\", the RFU instead seems fully prepared to back him, a response some may find ironic given the zero tolerance stance at Zurich Premiership level which has prompted touchline bans for, among others, Saracens' Australian coach Rod Kafer. The Scottish Rugby Football Union, meanwhile, have confirmed that their former coach Ian McGeechan has been approached by Woodward to join the Lions tour of New Zealand next year. McGeechan, now director of rugby at Murrayfield, has coached the Lions an unprecedented three times, most recently in 1997. In contrast, two potential Lions tourists, Sale's Jason Robinson and Chris Jones, have clarified their futures by signing new long-term contracts to remain with the Sharks. The 30-year-old Robinson, club captain this season, has committed himself to Sale for the rest of his career while Jones, who turns 24 this month, has signed a three-year deal. Gloucester have completed the signing of the New Zealand centre Nathan Mauger, the 26-year-old brother of All Black regular Aaron, from the Canterbury Crusaders. Mauger is currently listed as an overseas player but is working on an application for a French passport through his mother's side of the family. The All Black captain Tana Umaga will play a full part in preparations for this weekend's Tri-Nations game against South Africa in Johannesburg following the birth of his third child, a daughter Lily-Kate. New Zealand's coach Graham Henry names his side today with injury doubts over goalkicker Daniel Carter, centre Sam Tuitupou, prop Kees Meeuws and wing Doug Howlett. The lock Victor Matfield has returned to the Springbok squad. New Zealand have not played at Ellis Park since 2000 when the Springboks won 46-40, the last occasion the hosts beat the All Blacks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
