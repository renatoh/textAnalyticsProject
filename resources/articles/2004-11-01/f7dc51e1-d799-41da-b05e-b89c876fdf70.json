Sperm donors, currently paid around \u00a315, could also expect to receive up to \u00a350 a visit, as fertility clinics report shortages of both sperm and egg donations, research by the human fertilisation and embryology authority (HFEA) said. The shortages are expected to worsen when donor anonymity is removed in a law change next April. A survey of clinics by the HFEA found that most were already facing a greater demand for eggs and sperm than they could supply. It showed that 62% of clinics predicted that removing donor anonymity would have the greatest effect on sperm donation over the next five years, while 90% said they were already unable to meet demand for donated eggs. A recent report in the New York Times said sperm donation was falling in many countries because of law changes and many were importing sperm, especially from Denmark, it said, predicting blonder, more Nordic-looking populaces. Today the HFEA launched a public consultation on the crisis in the donation of sperm, eggs and embryos. The HFEA does not propose to allow donors to be paid, preferring donations to be made on an altruistic basis. But it is possible that compensation payments for the inconvenience involved in donation could increase, with suggestions that egg donors could receive as much as \u00a31,000. At present sperm donors are paid \u00a315 for each donation plus \"reasonable expenses\", with the cost passed on from the clinic to the recipient of the donation. In the HFEA's research, some clinics suggested compensation could range from nothing to \u00a350 to reflect the inconvenience. The consultation document said, in estimating this value, it should be remembered that donors can donate up to 50 times over a six month period, meaning a possible expenses claim of \u00a32,500. Expenses payments for egg donors could be even greater due to the increased inconvenience. The HFEA chairwoman, Suzi Leather, said: \"Unlike sperm donors, egg donation is a medically and surgically intrusive process. It can be painful and stressful and is not without risk.\" Ms Leather said many clinics and individual egg donors had urged the authority to consider allowing more compensation for egg donations. Some suggested payment up to \u00a31,000, while most favoured compensation of between \u00a3300 and \u00a3500. Payment at that level could dramatically increase the price couples pay for fertility treatment as the cost would be passed on to them. The HFEA, as part of its Sperm, Egg &amp; Embryo Donation Review, is now asking the public for its views on donor compensation. \"Over 37,000 children have been born in the UK as a result of people donating sperm, eggs and embryos, but our research shows that clinics are struggling to find suitable, willing donors for their patients,\" Ms Leather said. \"The changes in the law present new challenges and pose new questions, and it is extremely important that people make their views known, especially those already born from donor conception.\" Plans to remove the anonymity of donors in the UK were announced by the government in January and will come into force in April next year for those making donations after that time. They mean that children conceived through donation can find out the identity of their donor when they reach 18. The HFEA consultation runs until February 4.
