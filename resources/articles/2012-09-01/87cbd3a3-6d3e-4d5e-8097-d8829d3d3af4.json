The Chelsea manager was particularly unhappy about the way his side failed to keep the ball as he reflected on losing a 2-0 lead to the Italian champions. \"We're disappointed and a little bit deflated because we had put ourselves in a great position to win this game,\" he said. \"We were playing against a good team who were always dangerous, but we should really have closed the game. You try to be composed and keep the ball. But we did, at times, give it away cheaply. \"We should have done better with the ball. We lost possession for the second goal and we did not react quickly enough. That's a disappointment. We made a couple of mistakes on their goals and they had good movement and good finishes, so it was a bit of both.\" Di Matteo was, however, effusive in his praise of Oscar, the \u00a325m signing from Internacional. \"It was a great [full] debut,\" Di Matteo said. \"He's a big talent. He has a bit of everything, he's still young and we're very lucky to have him in the team. He did a good job tactically, he scored two goals and the second of them was a wonder goal. We shouldn't forget that he is still a young man \u2013 he is only 21 \u2013 but he is already quite established in his national team already.\" Oscar suffered an ankle injury in what Di Matteo described as a \"bad tackle\" by Leonardo Bonucci. \"The referee did do nothing about many challenges,\" Chelsea's manager said. \"The game has finished now for us. If Uefa has a look then good. But we have to move on from it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
