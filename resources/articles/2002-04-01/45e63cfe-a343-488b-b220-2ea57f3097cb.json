Its chairman, Richard Bowker, yesterday argued strongly for such a line, to be built by 2015. He told the Times that it was the best way to avert the prospect of a \"motorway system that's in complete gridlock\". Rail passenger numbers are forecast by the government to grow by a half over the next decade, as roads become more and more congested. The authority last year commissioned a feasibility study for such a line, and a team of engineers, economists, and environmentalists assembled by the consultancy firm WS Atkins is expected to endorse its viability. Julie Mills, leading the study, said: \"We're examining whether there's a need for a high speed line, and whether there's an economic case for it. What we're not into is detailed design or railway alignment [route] issues.\" There are two existing routes that could form the basis for the new line (aside from the west and east coast mainlines, which it is in part intended to relieve): that from London St Pancras to Yorkshire and the east Midlands; and that from London Marylebone through the Chilterns to Birmingham. Before joining the authority, Mr Bowker led a team at Virgin Trains that produced another route, running close to the east coast mainline past Peterborough, through Lincolnshire to Newcastle, as part of an unsuccessful bid by Virgin to take the east coast franchise from GNER. A railway industry source said: \"It would be much easier to build a line up the east, where there's a fair amount of farmland. On the west, you hit the west Midlands and you'd have to tear chunks out of towns.\" However, Ms Mills said: \"This is a strategic study - the outcome won't be 'this is where the line should be'. It will look in broad terms at whether this is the right approach.\" Another factor in choice of route is proximity to cities that would provide intermediate stops, and the siting of stations in city centres for passenger convenience and maximum usage. The line's cost is likely to exceed \u00a36bn, and it would be built and opened in stages, as was the TGV route from Paris first to Lyon, and later to Marseilles. Trains would run at 190mph but with long term scope for maximum speeds of 225mph. The benefits of a new line are being weighed against further work on the west coast mainline, being upgraded to take trains running at 140mph by 2005. The work, managed by Railtrack, has suffered delays and cost overruns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
