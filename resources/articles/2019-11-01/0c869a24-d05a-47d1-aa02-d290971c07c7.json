Our panel verdict", "bodyText": "Art Cullen: \u2018The hearings won\u2019t oust Trump\u2019 Acting Ukrainian ambassador William Taylor may have the voice of Walter Cronkite, but what he said on Wednesday is unlikely to oust Trump. About half the public opposes impeachment. Period. The House of Representatives, where Democrats have a majority, will impeach Trump. But the Republican-controlled Senate won\u2019t. Everyone knows Trump tried to get dirt on the Bidens and thinks it is wrong. But not everyone thinks what he did was impeachable. The hearing won\u2019t move public opinion sufficiently, despite the credibility of the witnesses and the pettiness of the Republican panelists who cross-examined them. Taylor and deputy assistant secretary of state George Kent merely confirmed what Trump himself and his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, already have acknowledged. \u201cGet over it,\u201d Mulvaney said. The truth will be told next November, when a corrupt liar is booted out of the White House and takes down the Republican majority in the Senate with him.

Republicans have a hodgepodge of half-baked defenses: Ukraine is corrupt and Trump cares about corruption (never mind that he wasn\u2019t interested in anything corruption-related apart from conspiracy theories that benefit him personally); Ukraine didn\u2019t actually do what Trump asked (never mind that whether Ukraine complied with the quid pro quo isn\u2019t the question); the aid was eventually released (never mind that it was released after the whistleblower made his complaint); this is all hearsay (never mind that people with direct knowledge of the matter are being barred by the White House from testifying). Democrats have coherence. Republicans have distractions and misdirections. This shouldn\u2019t be a partisan showdown nor a sporting event, and the facts should speak for themselves. What they say: the president put his personal interests over US foreign policy and national security. And Republicans have put their loyalty to Trump ahead of their loyalty to the country.

Then I watched the devastating testimony of acting ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor. He gave the first clear explanation I\u2019ve heard of how the alleged quid pro quo of \u201cwe\u2019ll give you assistance if you go on television and announce my political rivals are under investigation\u201d happened. He was also emphatic about the stakes. Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, soldiers and civilians have been dying every week, and the holding up of aid has real life-and-death consequences. Taylor\u2019s composure and confidence seemed to rattle the Republicans. The closest he looked to flummoxed was while being questioned by the Republican counsel Steve Castor. His questions were so convoluted that Taylor looked confused, like he was talking to a giant squid who learned English primarily by watching episodes of Law &amp; Order and Futurama. It\u2019s because of Taylor\u2019s testimony, and only because of his testimony, that I\u2019m off the fence. That said, I still find it hard to feel genuinely incensed by what I heard from the congresspeople in the hearing today. Part of the reason is that the hearings \u2013 and the broader impeachment debate \u2013 presents Trump\u2019s attempt to use another sovereign nation as a pawn as a radical break from American diplomacy. But is it really? Our history of destabilizing South America through supporting coups and political assassination reverberates as one nation after another is embroiled in regime change, voting irregularities and massive protests. Our unquestioned ally Israel is pounding the territory it occupies with air raids. As the hearing happens, President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, who has overseen war crimes in Syria, is sitting in the White House on official business. We are still dealing with Saudi Arabia, even after the assassination of a journalist and its war on Yemen. So for all the elevated talk by Democrats about how \u201cterrible\u201d Trump\u2019s manipulations of Ukraine have been, for all the hysterical Republicans asking things along the lines of, \u201cDon\u2019t you agree it should be illegal to hurt Daddy Trump\u2019s feelings?\u201d, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if every time someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 died overseas for the \u201cstrategic interests\u201d of the United States, one of these hearings was called? I would happily watch all of them, for any administration.

Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, a state department official charged with oversight of European and Eurasian affairs, delivered damning new evidence of the president\u2019s abuse of power. US foreign policy was, in fact, being held hostage to Trump\u2019s whims. Yet the limits of the president\u2019s defense and Democrats\u2019 power of persuasion were visible too. Eric Trump tweeted that the hearing was \u201chorribly boring\u201d, Representative Mark Meadows of the deep-red House Freedom Caucus opined \u201ceveryone has their own impression of what truth is,\u201d and Ohio\u2019s Jim Jordan sat predictably coatless and snarling. For Republicans, belief in Trump has congealed into an article of faith. No one will ever confuse Devin Nunes with the late Howard Baker. For Nunes, Inspector Clouseau is way more likely.

The questions they asked were mostly on point. The witnesses (career diplomats William Taylor and George Kent) came across as knowledgable and competent. There were unexpected revelations, particularly Taylor\u2019s assertion that President Trump asked about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in a telephone call with another official. The Republicans\u2019 questions, by contrast, ranged from inane to zany, with Representative Jim Jordan standing out for his dedication to unfounded conspiracy theories. None of the Republican questioners damaged the witnesses\u2019 credibility. But the significant fact of today\u2019s hearings, for me, is that Republicans Elise Stefanik of New York and Will Hurd of Texas stuck by the Republican party line that the witnesses had only secondhand knowledge of Trump\u2019s interactions, that the president had legitimate reasons to be concerned about Ukrainian corruption, and that the fact that Ukraine eventually received its withheld military aid shows that there was no quid pro quo. Stefanik and Hurd have a reputation for being among the most moderate and independent Republicans in Congress, willing to criticize Trump when circumstances (such as his betrayal of the Kurds) warrant it. Some Trump critics confidently anticipate that Representative Hurd, who\u2019s the party\u2019s sole African American representative in the House and is retiring at the end of this term, not only will vote for impeachment but will persuade other open-minded Republicans to do the same. But there was absolutely nothing in today\u2019s hearings to validate that hope. If Stefanik and Hurd fall in line behind Trump, chances are nearly every other Republican member of the House of Representatives will do the same. If support for impeachment divides almost entirely along partisan lines, that lessens the likelihood of significant numbers of Republican senators voting to remove the president. That means that in our current hyper-polarized politics, in which even the notion of objective truth is perceived in tribal terms, today\u2019s hearings have to be counted a victory for Trump.
