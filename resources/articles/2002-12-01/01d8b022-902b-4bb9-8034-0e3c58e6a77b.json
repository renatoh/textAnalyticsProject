The consortium that includes the former Leicester City plc directors Gilbert Kinch and Roy Parker withdrew their initial bid and intend to submit a replacement next week. \"The revised bid submitted last week by the consortium lapsed at 5pm on Wednesday,\" said a spokesman for the group. \"However, following further consultations with its advisors, a new proposal is being put together and will be submitted to the administrator shortly.\" The revision is understood to take account of the money invested in the building of the Walkers Stadium, which constitutes the largest single portion of the club's \u00a350m debt. Almost \u00a330m is owed to the US-based Teachers Bank, an amount that is beyond the means of either consortium. But the likelihood of Teachers following other creditors, accepting 10p in the pound and writing off \u00a327m is remote. Consequently, a deal that sees the bank leasing the stadium to the club's new owners is the probable solution. However, Nick Dargan, the administrator, is unable to strike an agreement with Teachers until he knows how much each consortium is offering for the club. The group led by Gary Lineker is understood to have raised \u00a34m, but some of this is in pledges; the amount Kinch and his associates have to offer is also unclear. \"The administrator cannot start to discuss a deal with the creditors until someone comes forward with cash rather than words,\" a spokesman for Dargan confirmed last night. Dargan has assured the Leicester manager Micky Adams he will do his utmost to avoid selling players to raise cash. Conversely, though, Adams will not be able to take advantage of next month's transfer window if the situation remains unresolved. \u00b7 Derby County's manager John Gregory and his staff have agreed to defer some of their salary until August. \"We are in full agreement and full support of what the club is trying to do,\" Gregory said. \"We are more than happy to defer whatever we can to help.\" Derby's players have also been asked to accept a deferral and their decision is expected today. \u00b7 Stefan Moore has signed a new 3-year contract with Aston Villa. The 19-year-old has made only nine appearances in the first team, but he scored a stunning hat-trick against an Everton side containing Wayne Rooney in last season's FA Youth Cup final. \u00b7 Reading are seeking the loan of another defender as a replacement for Matthew Upson, who has returned to Arsenal. Charlton's Steve Brown and Chelsea's 18-year-old Robert Huth are top of their list."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
