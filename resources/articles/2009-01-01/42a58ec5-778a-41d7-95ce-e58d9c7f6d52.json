The group, which includes two 15-year-olds and a 13-year-old, is alleged to have subjected the former England player to indecent chanting during the club's 2-0 home win against Spurs at Fratton Park in September. Hampshire police said the 11 had been charged with indecent chanting under the Football Offences Act after releasing 16 photographs of suspects from among the visiting supporters during a public appeal in December. A police spokeswoman said of the accused: \"They were charged with indecent chanting at a football match using words which were essentially swearwords. They weren't appropriate to be used at all, especially where there were children and we received a number of complaints.\" Five other people captured in photographs are being sought in connection with the incident, police said. Campbell, a former Spurs player, was outspoken about the incident, likening the abuse to human rights violations. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: \"We can all take the booing or light banter, but when it gets to the realms of verbal abuse, it's a bridge too far.\" Those charged today are Dean Nelson, 23, of Enfield, north London; Bradley Barnes, 35, of Bournemouth, Dorset; Oliver Silvester, 28, of Southampton; Stuart Turner, 34, of Wellington, Telford, Shropshire; Richard Allen Gibbs, 35, of Wokingham, Berkshire; Ian Trow, 48, of Deanshanger, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire; Keith Stevens, 54, of Hailsham, East Sussex; and Joe Turner, 18, of Langdon Hills, Basildon, Essex. The three youths charged were a 15-year-old from Winchmore Hill, north London, a 15-year old from Purley, Surrey, and a 13-year-old from Milton Keynes. One 18-year-old man arrested in connection with the investigation was released without charge. The FA recently announced funding for an anti-homophobia video as part of a campaign to rid football grounds of homophobic abuse. A spokesman for the Football Association said: \"The FA does not tolerate any forms of discrimination including homophobia, racist language or behaviour. We will continue to work with police and the clubs to ensure that any offenders are dealt with appropriately.\" A spokesman for Portsmouth, who play at Bristol City tonight in an FA Cup replay, said the club would not comment at this stage. Those charged were bailed to appear before magistrates on 20 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
