Another senior minister then quits over claims he misled the public over what he knew about a former aide\u2019s role in the alleged sabotage of a rape trial. Meanwhile, the deputy leader of the opposition walks out, several election candidates either quit or are ousted before they\u2019ve even got going \u2013 and one appears to compare celebrating the death of Tony Blair with the cheers that met the death of Hitler. And it\u2019s all rounded off by a wine-swilling prime minister publicly disagreeing with his Brexit secretary over how Northern Ireland will trade with the rest of the UK. This is not an unpublished script for a political farce, rejected by producers for its implausibility. It is, in fact, the first week in what many have called the most significant general election in a generation. A snap poll called to solve the parliamentary impasse over Britain\u2019s most important policy decision since the war has quickly turned into a competition to see who can go longest between gaffes. \u201cIt shows a December election isn\u2019t good for anyone,\u201d said one downhearted and cold candidate, shivering on the campaign trail. \u201cThen, on top of that, we\u2019ve got the general state of politics. It is thoroughly depressing.\u201d So what has been going wrong? According to insiders from across the parties, a mixture of distractions inside the campaigns, the rush of an unscheduled election and a generous dollop of personal stupidity are to blame. The question they are all nervously asking themselves is: which of the gaffes, if any, will end up making a difference? Tory insiders were feeling rattled by midweek. Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s claim that the Grenfell victims had not used \u201ccommon sense\u201d by heeding fire service advice to stay in the building was a straightforward disaster. It was not only insensitive, but played straight into the negative perception of the party as being aloof and out of touch. The resignation of Welsh secretary Alun Cairns, over claims about what he knew of a former aide\u2019s involvement in the alleged sabotage of a rape trial, was a damage-limitation exercise. On top of that, cabinet minister James Cleverly was lambasted for not turning up to an interview, while junior business minister Nadhim Zahawi managed to claim that he did not know whether Jeremy Corbyn wanted to actually shoot the rich. \u201cLabour stole a march \u2013 we were slow off the starting block,\u201d said one Tory figure with a grimace. The Conservative campaign team deemed the dissolution of parliament on Wednesday a \u201cline in the sand\u201d. Part of the problem, say those involved, was the transition from government: only on Wednesday were the Tories\u2019 advisers and aides finally united in one place, with Australian campaign chief Isaac Levido able to take control. That was also the moment when Sean Topham and Ben Guerin, the strategists charged with creating online viral content, could start in earnest. \u201cThe amount of time that has been taken to get small announcements over the line, that will make no real difference, is really something,\u201d said one official. \u201cIt can take weeks to get things signed off, and that has been a distraction. Everyone is now getting their feet under the table at CCHQ.\u201d In truth, the Tories\u2019 problems were only arrested by Labour\u2019s own difficulties. In a surprise move, Tom Watson announced he was stepping down as deputy leader and as an MP. He cited \u201cpersonal, not political reasons\u201d, yet the departure of the man who had become the figurehead for MPs concerned about the party\u2019s direction of travel was a huge moment. On Thursday, former Labour MPs Ian Austin and John Woodcock launched another missile, calling on voters to back the Conservatives because Corbyn was \u201ccompletely unfit\u201d to enter Downing Street. Austin\u2019s intervention delighted the Tory campaign and was replayed to staff in their headquarters on Matthew Parker Street. Then there were the calamity candidates. One selected Labour candidate, Sally Gimson, was blocked from standing after being accused of clashing with other members. Another faced a backlash after it emerged she had said she would celebrate the death of Tony Blair; a third, Jane Aitchison, attempted to defend her colleague by saying some people had celebrated the death of Adolf Hitler. Meanwhile, a Tory candidate quit over comments from 2014 in which he said women should keep their \u201cknickers on\u201d to avoid rape. Insiders say candidate selection has been speeded up, which has caused problems. In the Labour party, the speed of selections has turned low-level factional battles into noisy, public clashes. Despite the public anarchy, more serious battles are being waged behind the scenes. The tensions between No 10 and the Treasury over spending commitments and how to fund them, as well as a long-running debate about tax cuts, is storing up a potentially explosive relationship at the top of government should the Tories secure a majority. Among many Labour MPs, the most important development was Watson\u2019s departure. \u201cTom has been unhappy and uncomfortable for quite some time,\u201d said one. \u201cIt\u2019s come as a blow to so many of us because Tom has been seen as the standard-bearer for the centre-left Labour tradition. Some people would not be in the Labour party were it not for Tom. \u201cOur attitude is now hunker down, try to return as many of us as possible and see what kind of condition the party is in after the result.\u201d By contrast to the two main parties, the Lib Dems have had a relatively gaffe-free opening, though leader Jo Swinson was subjected to her own television mauling when asked to justify an election leaflet using one of the party\u2019s notoriously dodgy bar charts. Yet in terms of overall strategy, the party has suffered big blows. First, the BBC announced it was following ITV in excluding Swinson from its TV debate. Second, an unpredictable campaign has already veered away from the EU when the party\u2019s clear stance on opposing Brexit was its main rationale behind backing an early election. It is a tension that has been reflected internally. While the Lib Dems\u2019 overarching strategy is clear \u2013 make \u201cstop Brexit\u201d the answer to any question that its candidates are asked \u2013 a natural nervousness has emerged among some that the party is not doing more in other areas. This became acute as both the Tories and Labour announced huge spending plans last week. Campaign chiefs are having to calm nerves. While the gaffes and setbacks have been frequent, it is all but impossible to discern what parts of a campaign make a difference. The latest Opinium polling for the Observer, mostly conducted after Rees-Mogg\u2019s apology but before Austin\u2019s attack on Corbyn, suggests it is hard to read too much into last week\u2019s chaos. The Conservatives maintain a lead over Labour, but the gap has narrowed to 12 points. Academics warn against the dangers of over-analysing day-to-day events. \u201cMost stuff that happens in a campaign doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 and most campaigns don\u2019t matter, much,\u201d says Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London, who has written studies of the last three general elections. \u201cBut we know \u2013 especially after last time \u2013 that campaigns can matter a bit or more than a bit, and some [individual] things can matter. What we don\u2019t really know is what cuts through.\u201d This is the reality of the battle: parties throw various ideas around and see what sticks. It is in that context that the Tory team were delighted by the results of a focus group run by James Johnson, a former pollster for Theresa May. Conducted in a swing London seat, it found that Rees-Mogg\u2019s Grenfell comments had cut through. However, it also found that the core Tory message, \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d, was \u201cprofoundly powerful\u201d \u2013 including with some Remain voters. Labour officials are also concentrating on the positives. It has struck some party insiders who have not been fans of Corbyn that the leader is already a transformed figure. \u201cYou can just see it \u2013 he enjoys this stuff,\u201d says one. \u201cHe is a campaigner. He comes alive.\u201d With the final candidates being confirmed over the next week or so, campaign directors hope the potential for gaffes should diminish. Yet it was an event at the end of the week that gave pro-Remain campaigners most hope that trouble is ahead for the Tories. On Friday, a video emerged showing Johnson trying to reassure Northern Irish exporters that they would not need to fill in extra paperwork after Brexit. That appeared to contradict Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, who has said businesses would need to complete \u201cexit summary declarations\u201d when exporting to the rest of the UK. \u201cJohnson has been very successful in bringing things back to a place where Brexit is anything you want it to be,\u201d said one pro-Remain Labour figure. \u201cThe moment \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019 becomes something more specific, his coalition of support begins to break down.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
