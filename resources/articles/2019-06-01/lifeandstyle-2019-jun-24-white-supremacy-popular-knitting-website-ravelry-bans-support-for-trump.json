On Sunday, administrators for Ravelry, a site for knitters, crocheters, designers and anyone dabbling in the fibre arts, said that they were making any expression of support for Trump and his administration in forum posts, patterns, on their personal profile pages or elsewhere permanently off limits. \u201cWe cannot provide a space that is inclusive of all and also allow support for open white supremacy. Support of the Trump administration is undeniably support for white supremacy,\u201d the site\u2019s administrators said in a post. Users could also be permanently banned under the policy. The Trump ban comes only months after political upheaval gripped the knitting and crochet community around issues of racial and cultural insensitivity. That debate was sparked by popular knitwear designer and blogger Karen Templer, who wrote in January about a planned trip to India, likening it, in her excitement, to visiting Mars. Many in the craft community objected to the characterisation, calling it othering and reductive. Templer apologised soon afterwards, but the incident had a ripple effect, sparking off conversations about diversity and inclusivity in the craft community on Instagram, Ravelry and other places that crafters congregate online. A similar debate about cultural sensitivity and appropriation recently occurred in the sewing community. Ravelry said its new policy was not banning participation from people who supported Trump, only expressions of that support. \u201cWe are not endorsing the Democrats nor banning Republicans,\u201d the post said. \u201cWe are definitely not banning conservative politics. Hate groups and intolerance are different from other types of political positions.\u201d The policy drew on a similar statement made last year by roleplaying game site RPG.net, which banned advocacy of Trump from its forums on the grounds that the Trump administration was an \u201celected hate group\u201d. \u201cHis public comments, policies, and the makeup of his administration are so wholly incompatible with our values that formal political neutrality is not tenable,\u201d said RPG.net\u2019s administrators in a post. \u201cWe can be welcoming to (for example) persons of every ethnicity who want to talk about games, or we can allow support for open white supremacy. Not both.\u201d The knitting and crochet community has played a prominent role in the anti-Trump movement in the past, with women wearing homemade pink \u201cpussy\u201d hats to demonstrations around his election and inauguration becoming a distinctive symbol of protest against his presidency."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
