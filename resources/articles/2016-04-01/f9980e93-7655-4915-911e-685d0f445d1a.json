In the protectionist camp, there is now a wide range of political parties from the extreme left to the extreme right: from Syriza to Ukip, from the Front National to Podemos. The common element for all these parties is that they dream of returning to a time when \u201cwe were in control\u201d; when we could easily open or close our borders; when the world was manageable and small and we did not have to compromise. That is why they want national rules rather than international ones; and that is also why ultimately most of them despise the EU, because it is based not on direct control but on compromise. The problem with that notion is that such a cosy world does not exist any more. The new generations expect to talk, travel and trade with each other all over the world, no matter where they are. My children, for example, know more about startup products released for crowdfunding around the world than about what is sold in shops in our high street; they respond to fashions that are created thousands of miles away; and they expect products to reach them almost instantaneously, no matter where they are made. Fluidity, speed, seamlessness and complexity define the 21st century. Fighting those trends makes sense only if you are of such an age and means that you can afford the luxury of whingeing about the present and dreaming nostalgically about the past, but if you are still trying to make your way in life, you have to embrace change and adapt. Companies are rightly responding as quickly as possible to those new demands and, as a result, we are witnessing a level of international outsourcing that we could never have imagined. \u201cMade in\u201d labels mean little nowadays: companies based in the west often have their production plants elsewhere and use components sourced from third countries; and are financed by investors in yet other countries. If that were not complex enough, when countries impose trade barriers and erect controls, companies simply move overnight. Regulators and governments often do not stand a chance. That does not mean regulators should let modern trade become the Wild West. But it means they need to have the flexibility and tools to react better and faster. That is the case with dumping, of which China has been accused by some in the case of UK steel. Companies that dump undercut free trade and it is only right that anti-dumping duties are imposed on them. But when anti-dumping duties are imposed on a country, companies move to third countries and start dumping all over again. That is why it is important to give the tools to the European commission to react quickly to such a chain of events. While the UK government\u2019s blocking of the commission\u2019s attempts to speed up the anti-dumping mechanisms since 2013 was probably well meant, unless we react quickly and hit hard on dumping we will be allowing dumping to destroy free trade \u2013 at our expense. Likewise, an interesting new trade regulatory debate is popping up in relation to the modern slavery trade. Countries being able to produce cheaper products on the basis of their competitive advantage, including lower labour costs, is what free trade is all about. But the import and sale of goods produced by workers in other countries who do not receive the minimum national living wage \u2013 \u201cmodern slavery\u201d \u2013 is not free trade \u2013 it is an abuse of human rights. The UK government has taken the initiative in this area with the modern slavery bill. But such a bill does not attach any consequences for companies that are aware that there is modern slavery in their supply chain. Without tougher consequences, the chances of this changing things on the ground will be virtually zero. If legislators and regulators want to be able to deal with the complexities and speed of modern trade, they need to up their game. But the world is such they can\u2019t control it all. No matter how much protectionists whinge, free trade has now won.
