Sarah Mansfield", "bodyText": "I discovered the Guardian Weekly in 2001 at the newsagent in Narrabri, a country town in north-western New South Wales. The Guardian Weekly rapidly became my connection to the wider world, helping to ease the transition from postgraduate life at a major university to being a working scientist in regional Australia. GW has continued to be my companion as I shifted back and forth between New Zealand, my home country, and my adopted home in Australia. Like many of your correspondents, I find GW a great read on buses, trains and planes. Notes &amp; Queries is always amusing and I appreciate the outside perspective on Australasian events. Wordpool tests my linguistic skills but the crossword will be a retirement challenge. As a professional entomologist, I am always pleased to see articles about the role of insects in our lives and environment. The Weekly\u2019s articles on development projects and teaching English to non-native speakers informed my teaching and supervision of students from many countries. I look forward to many more years of the Weekly\u2019s company."}, "isHosted": false}}}
