Ashley Young is sitting in the corner of a snooker room, wearing a hooded top and the kind of diamond-encrusted accessories that demonstrate how sporting excellence can reap fantastic remuneration. He is talking about his upbringing and how football shaped his early life and, at times, it sounds like a scene from the Beano. Those long nights, for example, when he and his brothers would play until it was so dark they could barely see the ball. There were the impassioned debates with his teachers about his stop-at-nothing devotion to a sporting career. Then one day in particular that still makes him drag his fingers down his face in horror \u2013 the time a misplaced shot, in the family lounge of all places, led to some new rules in the Young household. \"It was an ornamental swan,\" he recalls. \"I smashed off its head, clean at the neck. I got some Superglue and tried to put it all back together, hide it from my mum, but I was 10 years old and it was a botched-up job \u2013 the head wasn't straight, the neck was all crooked and I had glue all over my hands. My mum was home about five minutes when she noticed. That was the day, I think, when she decided no more balls in the house.\" Until then, the family home was, according to the second eldest of Luther and Sharon's four boys, a place where \"the living room doubled up as our pitch, and the sofa was the goal.\" Football was all he wanted to do from the age of five, when he joined Stevenage Colts. \"It was everything. If we didn't have a ball we'd play with a stone. If we didn't have a stone we'd play with a can. Football was all we cared about.\" The odd broken ornament aside, those games were the embryonic stages of some promising careers. Young styled himself on Ian Wright, plastering posters of the Arsenal striker on his bedroom walls and playing in attack for his junior team, scoring 64 times in one season and eight in one match alone. The next sibling, Lewis, has followed him into the Watford first team while Kyle, the youngest member of the family, is with Arsenal's academy. But there is no doubt where most of the magic-dust was sprinkled. He is 24 now, an integral part of a Villa side whose early results this season suggest a difficult afternoon for Chelsea at Villa Park today. \"If we had beaten Blackburn Rovers the other Saturday it would have been our best start for 79 years,\" Young points out. \"Even so, it's been a good start. We have shown already that we can have another good year.\" First, though, there is another subject to address. Young has just become an ambassador for Kick It Out and he is here, giving a rare interview, as part of the organisation's main annual event. \"Being a black man myself, and having experienced racism, I just wanted to try to help,\" he says. \"I'm lucky because I have never had it as a professional, from a crowd or an opposition player, and that's encouraging because it has clearly improved. But I did experience it when I was young. I was 12, playing a Saturday-morning game. Stevenage is a multicultural society, with a lot of different ethnic groups, but there were lads on the other team, calling me names \u2013 all the usual words. \"I can remember being upset and going back to my parents and talking to my dad. He was born in Jamaica but he had come over to England when he was younger and he had been through similar experiences because it was worse back in his generation. That's the encouraging thing \u2013 that it is getting better. But if I can do anything to prevent it happening to other young kids, then hopefully I can do that. You need positive role models and that's why I have come on board.\" Kick It Out's \"weeks of action\" began on Thursday and runs until 27 October, with the campaign's director, Piara Powar, commenting that \"players such as Ashley are critical to the success of many of the initiatives\". One is to entice more Asian players in the game. \"It's perhaps because there isn't someone at the very top level getting the ball rolling for others to follow, but I'm hoping this changes,\" Young says. \"It's healthy for the game to have a mix of different people.\" He is planning to take the message to youth groups in the Birmingham area. But first there is the small matter of facing Carlo Ancelotti's team today. \"Villa,\" says Young, \"is a great place to work right now.\" Later, he says he \"could not be happier\" and reiterates he has no desire to leave the club, despite the speculation before the start of the season. His form has not quite reached the level of last season, if the average Holte Ender is to be believed. England's squad has been overflowing with Villa players recently but Fabio Capello has overlooked the man wearing the claret and blue No7 shirt. \"I've felt a part of it [the England set-up] when I've been involved so I just have to carry on trying to impress him,\" Young says. \"I think I've done quite well when I've had the chance. But I'm still young and I know I've still got a lot to learn. I'm pleased to have won caps but I know there is still more to come from me. \"I'm an ambitious person and it's a World Cup year. I'm just the same as everyone \u2013 I can remember growing up, watching the World Cup. But it's still a long way away and I've got to concentrate on things at Villa first.\" One certainty: it would be foolish for anyone to write off Young's chances of being on the plane to South Africa next summer. His club career has been on an almost non-stop upwards trajectory, from scoring on his Watford debut to becoming the star of the side that won promotion in 2006 and moving to Villa for a shade under \u00a310m the following January. The manager, Martin O'Neill, has described him as a \"genius\" and \"world-class\" and it is evident that the respect is mutual. \"He knows how to get the best out of you,\" Young says, nodding. \"You know that if you do well for him he will back you. He's always in your corner, always wanting to fight for you. You want to do well for him, to get that approval. But you also know you don't want to cross him.\" Rejection has driven Young before. His career almost ended before it had begun when, at the age of 16 and having spent six years with Watford's juniors, he was told he would not be given a YTS contract. \"They told me I could go part-time, which meant going back to school and training twice a week, or go somewhere else. That was the turning point, the moment when I knew I had to fight to show them they were wrong. It hurt, that sense of rejection, and another person might have packed it in, I suppose. But I'd already dedicated my life to being a footballer. \"I had to go to see the careers woman at school and when she asked me what I wanted to do after school I told her flat: 'I want to be a professional footballer.' I can remember her being silent for a few seconds, just looking at me. She said, 'OK, but what if that doesn't work?' She must have said it three or four times: 'What if it doesn't work?' and each time I just replied exactly the same way: 'I want to be a professional footballer, that's all I want to do, there is nothing else I want to do.' \"That's how dedicated I was. I wanted to prove them wrong so I took the part-time option and I set about showing them I wanted it so badly. Within a year they had offered a professional contract.\" For information on Kick It Out's One Game, One Community weeks of action visit www.kickitout.org"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
