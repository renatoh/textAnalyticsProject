The Radio Times conducted one of the largest attempts to answer a question that regularly dominates Whovian debates and divides fans. Offering a choice between 13 actors who have played the Doctor, beginning with William Hartnell in 1963, fans were asked to simply choose their favourite. Tennant came top of the poll with 10,518 votes, but family tensions are likely to be sharpened this week because of the actor who came bottom. In 13th place, with a sparse 315 votes, was Peter Davison, the fifth Doctor and father of Tennant\u2019s wife, Georgia. Just 95 votes behind Tennant was Whittaker, the first woman to play the Time Lord. Each received 21% of the vote. Third in the poll was Peter Capaldi with 8,897 votes (18%), followed by Matt Smith with 7,637 votes (16%) and Tom Baker with 3,977 votes (8%). Huw Fullerton, sci-fi and fantasy editor of Radio Times, said it was striking that Tennant came out on top more than a decade after leaving the show. \u201cWith Jodie Whittaker hot on his heels and a great showing for other recent Doctors like Peter Capaldi, it looks like fans also hold other Time Lords to their hearts.\u201d Tennant was three when he told his parents he wanted to be an actor because of Doctor Who. In 2005, his dreams became a reality when he was cast to succeed Christopher Eccleston in Russell T Davies\u2019 hugely successful revival of the show, staying for three series. He may be one of the UK\u2019s most celebrated Shakespearean actors and the star of many hit TV shows, including Broadchurch and Good Omens, but for many people Tennant will always be Doctor Who. Last week, playing serial killer Dennis Nilsen in the ITV series Des, there were probably people asking: \u201cIs that Doctor Who?\u201d In an interview with the Guardian, Tennant was cheerful about the lifelong attention being the Doctor brings. It is, he said, \u201ca wonderful, humbling thing but it does mean accepting an adjustment to your life\u201d. The Radio Times conceded the question of who is the best Doctor was one it had posed several times over the years. But with Whittaker at the helm \u2013 \u201cand with no sign of her handing in the sonic screwdriver any time soon\u201d \u2013 now seemed like a good time to renew the debate. There were rules. Voters could only choose \u201clead\u201d Doctors \u2013 \u201cactors who canonically held the role as the incumbent Doctor at one time or another\u201d, which meant no John Hurt (\u201cthe war Doctor\u201d), Jo Martin (\u201cthe fugitive Doctor\u201d), Peter Cushing (a movie Doctor, not considered as part of the Doctor Who canon) or David Bradley (who has played the first Doctor in the rebooted series). That meant Paul McGann, the eighth Doctor, who starred in the 1996 TV movie, could be included. The film, with a sizeable budget, was the first attempt to revive the show after it was axed by the BBC. It failed in that respect, but McGann, who has also played the Doctor in an audio drama, still managed to get a respectable 1,427 votes, or 3%. Poll result 1. David Tennant 10,518 / 21% 2. Jodie Whittaker 10,423 / 21% 3. Peter Capaldi 8,897 / 18% 4. Matt Smith 7,637 / 16% 5. Tom Baker 3,977 / 8% 6. William Hartnell 1,983 / 4% 7. Paul McGann 1,427 / 3% 8.
