We only mention this because he'd probably down (Pro) tools in exasperation at the Black Lips' feral singalong, perhaps taking the opportunity to nip out for a wheatgrass smoothie instead. \"Bad kids, all our friends are bad kids, product of no dads kids, kids like you and me\", they whine cheerily over a country-punk kerfuffle. Don't be fooled, though: like the Beasties, Redd Kross and the Mondays before them, it takes nous to sound so winningly delinquent. Royworld, Dust (Virgin) Ever noticed how upfront the jukebox in the Rovers' Return is? They were on to Duffy'n'Adele so early that you'd swear Betty Turpin has a secret sideline as controller of 6 Music. Actually, that would be the only viable explanation for said radio station getting behind insipid toss like this. For the record, Royworld - not to be confused with Roy's Rolls; they're into the Ting Tings - trade in the kind of airbrushed FM rock that's precision-tooled for people who find Athlete a bit avant garde, The Feeling too racy and Dermot O'Leary a bloody good bloke. Stick to making the hot pots, Betty, for all our sakes. The Pigeon Detectives, This Is An Emergency (Dance To The Radio) This promo CD came packaged in a metal box with a window but - really! - what emergency could be so dire that you'd need to smash the glass and rip out a new Pigeon Detectives single which sounds like all last year's efforts without the youthful waggishness? Tell you what: we'll leave it behind our desk by the icky American chocolate and report back in, oooh, 2012. Sparks, Good Morning (Lil Beethoven) Agh! Quick, break open the Pigeon Detectives CD! Only joking but, god, Sparks aren't half irritating. This month they're playing all their albums live over 21 nights, a great conceit, though any right-thinking person would take a mini-break in Guantanamo Bay rather than going the whole distance. If you weren't born last time they had a decent record out (the Giorgio Moroder-produced Beat The Clock in 1979), then simply imagine how Kendal's reigning dons of falsetto berk-pop, Wild Beasts, would sound after another 40 years of holding out against getting a proper job. The Ting Tings, That's Not My Name (Columbia) Now this is how to give good annoyance; like a choice piece of hard skin near the fingernail, people actually enjoy being irritated by the Ting Tings. Is it their silly name, singer Katie's girl-group past, or merely their daringly Bis-like take on playground-friendly disco-punk? Whatever: it's easy to overlook just how smart That's Not My Name is. For the B-side da Tings have got their fans to leave their names on an answering machine and pasted those into the mix. They're full of great pop ideas like that, the little sods."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
