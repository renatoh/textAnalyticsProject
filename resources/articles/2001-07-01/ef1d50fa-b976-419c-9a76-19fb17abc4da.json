But Tony Brooks, 59, said the Star had paid a heavy price for the loss of the libel action 14 years ago. \"I am absolutely delighted. I felt really really chuffed when I heard. I said 'Yes, yes, yes'. \"The sad thing is that Lloyd Turner, the editor, is not around to see this day. It was a brave editor to do what he did and he carried the can for it,\" he said. David Graham also expressed his relief and delight at the verdict, saying: \"I feel a great deal of wrongs have been righted.\" \"It's taken 13 years for this to happen,\" he said, \"and it's ironic that what Lord Archer decided to do - which was to accuse the Daily Star of maligning his name with inaccuracies - has led to the exposure of his own lies.\" He also believes that Lord Archer had contributed to the premature death of Mr Turner. Tony Brooks and David Graham were the bylines on the fateful article published in the Star back in 1986, five days after the News of the World first revealed Lord Archer had paid off prostitute Monica Coghlan. The Star's splash headline - \"Vice girl Monica talks about Archer: the man she knew\" - alleged that Mr Archer paid Miss Coghlan \u00a350 for sex and \u00a320 for \"extra time\" during a 15-minute session in a Mayfair hotel. The story appeared after Mr Brooks tracked down Ms Coghlan's nephew in Rochdale and followed categoric denials from Mr Archer that he had either met or slept with her. Today Mr Brooks said: \"I always knew Archer was a dodgy person. But we, the two reporters, were not affected. I was with the Star until three years ago. \"What was upsetting, however, was the way the judge in the original trial summed up. It was so loaded against us. \"And our regret was that we did not appeal at the time. More would have come out. I think that affected the Daily Star and the confidence of the paper tremendously. \"At the time, I think the circulation was around 1.5m but after that it lost credibility. A new editor was brought in who attempted to trawl the porn market and its circulation just plunged and it has struggled to win back readers ever since.\" He still holds the original cutting from the Star, complete with warnings stamped in red ink from the in-house lawyers. Now freelancing in Manchester, Mr Brooks couldn't afford to attend the trial in London. But he said he didn't deserve the credit for the original story. \"It was the News of the World that had the resources to break the story. But Archer didn't go after them. He went for us because he thought we were easy prey.\" The reporters may now be in a position to claim for some damages from the courts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
