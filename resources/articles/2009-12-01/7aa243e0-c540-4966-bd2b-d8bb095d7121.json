She had a glorious voice and gift for wry observation and humour, matched with a no-nonsense approach to her work. She was a musicians' musician, and when she released her best of album, Galore, her contemporaries were queuing up to explain why she was important. For Bono she was \"one in a line of great English songwriters that include Ray Davies, Paul Weller and Morrissey ... the No\u00ebl Coward of her generation\", while for Morrissey she was \"a supreme original\". Billy Bragg (whose song A New England brought her a top ten hit in 1985) described her as \"unpretentious, inimitable, writes like a playwright, sings like an angel\". Since her death, she has became best known, especially at this time of year, for her duet with Shane MacGowan, right, on Fairytale of New York, recorded in 1987. It has rightly become one of the great Christmas standards of the rock and folk-rock eras, but was just part of her varied repertoire. She was born into a musical family: her mother was the dancer and choreographer Jean Newlove, and her father the fiercely leftwing folk singer-songwriter Ewan MacColl, who later married Peggy Seeger. Kirsty MacColl was happy to work with folk and rock musicians alike. Her first hit was a cheerful rock novelty piece, There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis, and she went on to record anything from a glorious, unashamedly emotional version of the Ray Davies song Days, to her own defiant and personal My Affair. Before her death, she was still changing styles, and her final, and arguably finest album, Tropical Brainstorm, reflected her growing fascination with Latin music. The Justice for Kirsty campaign may have been suspended, but she will be remembered for some of the classic English pop songs of the last 30 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
