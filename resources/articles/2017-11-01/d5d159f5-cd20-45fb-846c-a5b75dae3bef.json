In 2000, a mere 537-vote deficit in Florida and the US supreme court stood between Al Gore and the White House. Sixteen years later, Hillary Clinton garnered a 2.86 million vote plurality, only to see her ambitions dashed in the Rust Belt. Both times, Donna Brazile was there, first as Gore\u2019s campaign manager, then in 2016 as the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Brazile most certainly has a story to tell. In Hacks, her new book, she points fingers, names names and self-absolves. Replete with f-bombs, male anatomical references and tales of alcohol consumption, the book is an easy and vivid read, everything one expects in a first-person campaign narrative \u2013 except for its detailed discussion of Russia\u2019s hacks, WikiLeaks, and threats to Brazile herself. On that score, the book is down-right alarming. From the get-go, Brazile bristles with contempt for Robby Mook, the data-driven Clinton campaign manager, and Brandon Davis, Mook\u2019s emissary to the Democratic National Committee (DNC). She is respectfully disapproving of Clinton\u2019s hauteur and tin ear, which she captures with a deft touch, and bathes Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Brazile\u2019s predecessor at the debt-ridden DNC, with acid-laced kindness. Brazile also takes the Obamas to task for standing idly as the Democratic party imploded on their watch. As Brazile tells it, \u201cthree titanic egos \u2013 Barack, Hillary, and Debbie \u2013 had stripped the party to a shell for their own purposes.\u201d Brazile pummels Mook. Mincing no words, she declares: \u201cI want to talk about the arrogance and isolation of the Clinton campaign and the cult of Robby Mook, who felt fresh but turned up stale, in a campaign haunted by ghosts and lacking in enthusiasm, focus, and heart.\u201d In Brazile\u2019s view, campaigns are supposed to be about competence in execution, passion and fun. On this score, Mook was 0-for-3. Worse, Mook and his men sought to put the kibosh on Brazile\u2019s efforts to bolster the DNC and the Democrats, which tack was driven in large measure by sexism but not racism, according to the African-American Brazile. Over a conference call with the Clinton campaign\u2019s high command, Brazile recalls, genital size became the measure of all things. She announced: \u201cThis feels like power and control. Gentlemen, let\u2019s just put our dicks on the table and see who\u2019s got the bigger one, because I know that mine is bigger than all of yours.\u201d Interestingly, Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s supposed alter ego, is never present during these dust-ups, giving the impression that she was simply Clinton\u2019s kid-sister and disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s ex-wife. Abedin as strategic player? Not so much. After Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeplorables\u201d speech at Cipriani Wall Street and her collapse at the 9/11 ceremony in lower Manhattan, Brazile writes that she was forced to take stock of Clinton\u2019s candidacy and assess the possibility of replacing the ticket, a power actually possessed by the DNC. In Brazile\u2019s view, a combination of Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Cory Booker would have been a dream team, particularly in the face of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal to white working-class voters and the Democrats\u2019 dependence on minority turnout. Brazile also writes that Clinton\u2019s failure to immediately come clean about her bout with pneumonia \u201cfed the impression that Hillary was lying to us\u201d. As to be expected, Brazile goes easy on Brazile. She makes no mention of the DNC spending scarce funds in get-out-the-vote efforts that targeted Chicago (in reliably blue Illinois) and New Orleans (in predictably red Louisiana). She also pushes back hard against accusations that she leaked primary debate questions to the Clinton campaign, even as she was a CNN commentator. Still, Brazile acknowledges that as the result of binding agreements hammered out by Wasserman Schultz, the DNC had become a Clinton campaign subsidiary. Yes, the Bernie Bros really had reason to be angry. The fix was in. Brazile also deals with race, gender, and identity politics. Hacks recounts how turnout among black women dropped from Obama\u2019s presidential bids to Clinton\u2019s run, and discusses incarceration as an issue of particular concern to African American voters. At the same time, Brazile, an adjunct assistant professor, writes of how her students disapproved of identity politics. Sounding awfully like Columbia\u2019s Mark Lilla, Brazile comments that her students thought Clinton spent too much time \u201ctrying to appeal to people based on their race, or their gender, or their sexual orientation\u201d and not enough time on the issues. In reality, even with Donald Trump, this is a problem the Democrats must address. Running up the score in Blue America, without an eye toward America\u2019s interior, is a surefire way of making 2020 a rerun of 2000 and 2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
