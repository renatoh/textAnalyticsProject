The online-offline divide has never felt so vast, or insurmountable. Six weeks in, with a fortnight to go, memes have brought much-needed light relief to the longest federal election campaign since the 1960s \u2013 an alternative focal point to the interminable back-and-forth of backflips and black holes. The Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union was among the first to deliver its Jekyll-and-Hyde social media presence \u2013 stern condemnation of the exploitation of workers one tweet, Bill Shorten as a frog on a unicycle the next \u2013 and it was the subject of Atkins\u2019 scrutiny on Insiders in late May. \u201cThis \u2013 that \u2013 we just saw was a \u2018dank meme\u2019 put up by the AMWU against the prime minister,\u201d he said uncertainly, \u201cso watch your dank memes.\u201d Atkins may be relieved to learn that even the dankest of memes is at best a diversion among younger voters. But coverage of them does serve to distract from the professionalism, strategy and resources underpinning the major parties\u2019 digital campaigns. The election will not be won by Dat Boi. But it could be won on Facebook. On Friday, Bill Shorten and Malcolm Turnbull go head to head in a debate hosted by Facebook. It\u2019s a first for Australian politics, and evidence of how much has changed since the last election in 2013. When Tony Abbott became prime minister, Facebook was six months into bedding in its most significant changes since it introduced the Timeline in 2011. Images were bigger, it was more mobile-friendly, and for the first time feeds could be split \u2013 for example, into posts by close friends or celebrities. At the announcement in March 2013, Mark Zuckerberg likened the new Facebook to \u201cthe most personalised newspaper\u201d, which aroused scepticism among some commentators because news was supposedly Twitter\u2019s bag. Today there are thought to be 15 million Australians on Facebook \u2013 62.5% of the population, and an advance of 1 million even on the previous year \u2013 and it is a primary news source for many of them. By comparison, Twitter has about 4.5 million users, fewer than Instagram. Representatives from political parties and external digital agencies that work with them agree that the attitude towards online in 2013 was that it was probably important; this time around, it is understood to be as vital an arm of the campaign as door-knocking and traditional media spots. A spokesman for Labor says online campaigning is more integrated than ever before, with a 15-person team now devoted to digital. There is widespread recognition, he says, that digital can no longer be an afterthought. Less straightforward is to what end these digital campaigns are geared. Specifics about their strategies or spend are known only by the parties themselves and the digital agencies they employ. (The Greens\u2019 investment in online advertising, at least, is understood to be its second-biggest spend, behind billboards.) The most obvious benefit is the potential for reach, far greater than that which comes from even a primetime television spot. The first leaders\u2019 debate of this campaign, the people\u2019s forum broadcast on Sky News on a Friday night in May, was watched by about 54,000 people. But a clip of Shorten\u2019s opening statement \u2013 complete with subtitles and overlay footage \u2013 produced and posted by Labor\u2019s digital unit before the debate had finished \u2013 went on to reach more than 55,000 people. (Other clips produced by the party have been viewed more than 1m times, a spokesman says.) Labor made seven Facebook posts and 80 tweets during the hour-long live broadcast, which received a cumulative 450,000 organic impressions; the Liberal party posted two Facebook posts and 12 tweets in the same period. Shorten has 130,000 people who like his page on Facebook, roughly half the number that like both the Labor and Liberal party pages. Malcolm Turnbull alone exceeds that figure by 10,000. But reach alone is a flawed measure \u2013 the real benefits of digital come from engagement. That\u2019s why you will find Turnbull and Julie Bishop on Snapchat, even though it seems reasonable to assume their awkward presence there will have next to no bearing on the outcome of the election. As haphazard as it can sometimes seem, this kind of interactivity is digital\u2019s edge over traditional campaigning. \u201cIt\u2019s active, rather than just sitting there and being bombarded,\u201d says Jonathan Hawkes. Now of the Minerals Council of Australia, he was digital communications coordinator of the Liberal party for Abbott\u2019s 2013 campaign. \u201cThat was the goal \u2013 to try and get people engaged and take some action.\u201d The Liberal party\u2019s five-week campaign on Facebook was hailed by the platform as one of its marketing \u201csuccess stories\u201d, with more than 160m impressions and 4.3m interactions. Its integrated app, The Choice (which presented one of the Hobson\u2019s variety) was used by 200,000 people. \u201cIt\u2019s never really about the pure numbers,\u201d Hawkes says. \u201cYou want the engagement \u2013 you want people to click, share or like because that gets more people outside of that circle involved and aware of your messages.\u201d Otherwise there is a risk of preaching to the converted, which Labor\u2019s spokesman acknowledges: \u201cIf you\u2019re a strong Liberal supporter, you\u2019re unlikely to like the Labor Facebook page.\u201d But he adds: \u201cOne of the most important things about online campaigning is sharing information with our supporters who are then better informed in order to have conversations about Labor\u2019s policies and priorities.\u201d More engaged voters are also more likely to give their time and money in support of a party at a time when formal membership rates are lower than ever. Three days after the people\u2019s forum, Labor had received $42,000 in small donations \u2013 $10,000 within the first nine hours. People\u2019s willingness to make online payments has increased with time, but the success of those appeals depends on strategy \u2013 Hawkes points to A/B testing of the Liberal party\u2019s emails in 2013 as crucial to its fundraising success. A representative of one digital agency says half of all donations to organisations are made through their websites. In one case, straightforward changes \u2013 to language, imagery, layout and structure \u2013 increased donations by 10%. As a fundraising arm, digital is well established. The question now is whether it can change voter intention, and many involved in the area believe it can. That is partly thanks to leaps made in targeting, one of the biggest relevant advances in digital since the 2013 campaign. Facebook posts can now be directed with unsettling specificity to users based on any number of characteristics, including age, sex, political affiliation and \u2013 crucially \u2013 location. Elections are won and lost in marginal seats, and being able to target individual electorates is an invaluable tool. But the major parties are reluctant to say exactly how the Facebook feature is being used \u2013 at least until the campaign is over. Digital campaigning is particularly important in the weeks between pre-polls opening and election day, Hawkes says, when an uptick in interest from voters is matched by a burst of online activity by political parties. But as established and integral as digital seems to be to the campaign, there is one area that has yet to catch up. A ban on electoral advertising on radio and television in the last three days does not extend to social media \u2013 meaning it\u2019s all platforms go for those digital teams until 2 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
