He also referred to the fires as \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d. Three Baptist churches in St Landry Parish \u2013 Mount Pleasant, St Mary and Greater Union \u2013 burned between 26 March and 4 April. Sheriff Bobby Guidroz has increased security at other houses of worship in the parish, just north of Lafayette and about 100 miles north-east of New Orleans. Authorities have called the fires \u201csuspicious\u201d. Late last week, Louisiana Fire Marshal H \u201cButch\u201d Browning said \u201cpatterns\u201d had been discovered. \u201cThere certainly is commonality and whether that leads to a person or persons or groups, we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. Pastor Freddie Jack, president of the Seventh District Missionary Baptist Association, told CNN on Monday: \u201cAt first we thought it might have been an electrical problem but then when the second church \u2026 burning occurred I realized it was our sister church \u2026 then two days later the third occurred so \u2026 [it] made me think that we\u2019re being targeted.\u201d Ashley Rodrigue, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana fire marshall, said investigators had not concluded the fires were connected. In the same two-week span, a fire was \u201cintentionally set\u201d at a predominantly white church in Caddo Parish, Louisiana and at a building housing a social justice not-for-profit group in New Market, Tennessee. At the Tennessee blaze, which destroyed the headquarters of the Highlander Center, authorities found graffiti associated with the white power movement. According to the center\u2019s executive directors, the fire destroyed \u201cdecades of historic documents, speeches, artifacts and memorabilia\u201d from the civil rights movement. According to FBI data, hate crimes have been on the rise in the US since 2015. Johnson tied the fires to \u201cemboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country\u201d. \u201cFor decades,\u201d he said, \u201cAfrican American churches have served as the epicenter of survival and a symbol of hope for many in the African American community. As a consequence, these houses of faith have historically been the targets of violence.\u201d In one week in the summer of 2015 there were reports of at least seven fires at black churches in southern states. Foul play was ruled out in several cases. In four cases in which investigators concluded intentional arson was involved, no arrests were made. On Tuesday morning the House judiciary committee commenced a hearing on Hate Crimes and the Rise of White Nationalism, at the urging of the NAACP. In Louisiana, Alanah Odoms Hebert, executive director of the state American Civil Liberties Union, said the fires were a \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d reminder of the violence that communities of color face in the south. \u201cWhile the investigation into the cause of the fires continues,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s on all of us to speak out against hate and intolerance, and stand in solidarity with the communities affected by these tragedies\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
