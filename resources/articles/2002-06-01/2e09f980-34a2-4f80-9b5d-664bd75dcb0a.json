Maybe David Beckham and Cafu will recreate the moment here in Shizuoka tomorrow, though not, England hope, in similar circumstances. Whatever the result, there will be one crucial difference. Moore and Pele did not believe they were saying goodbye, just au revoir. Brazil, in spite of their 1-0 victory in Guadalajara, believed they would be renewing acquaintances with England, then co-favourites, in the final. Tomorrow there will be only one survivor. Normally it would be hard to resist the feeling that England and Brazil are playing for a place in the final since the winners will meet Senegal or Turkey, who play their quarter-final in Osaka on Saturday, in the semi-finals. At the moment, however, normality is too rare a commodity to be taken for granted. What can be assumed is that the winners will continue to receive strong local backing plus any extra support left over from Japan's elimination. This is what happened in 1970 when, after the hosts had been knocked out, Mexicans swung passionately behind Brazil. When Brazil played Belgium in Kobe on Monday night the scene in the Wing Stadium left little doubt as to where most Japanese sympathies will now lie. Small clusters of Belgian red were dotted around a sea of Brazilian yellow like poppies in a field of rape. Unlike Mexico, when Alf Ramsey's xenophobia had ensured anti-English feeling, England will be able to count on strong Japanese backing, even if much of it is down to Beckham-mania. And, of course, they have the huge body of English support that was not available in 1970. The setting, therefore, could hardly be better for an outstanding game of football, which this World Cup badly needs. So far it has been strong on drama, high on excitement and caused more upsets than a flu bug. But there has yet to be a match of high quality. Given the presence of David Beckham and Michael Owen on one side and Ronaldo and Rivaldo on the other, it is hard to see how the fourth World Cup encounter between England and Brazil can fail, even if neither side can recapture the supreme moments of 1970. That was probably the best performance ever given by an England team, even though they lost. Tomorrow England could play half as well and win and the outcome may depend on which team's anchorman, Nicky Butt or Gilberto Silva, drags his chain less. The quarter-finals often make or break a World Cup's legacy. Should England and Brazil produce a poor match, the other three games would struggle to redeem the anti-climax. Germany, seemingly immune to shocks after England's 5-1 win in Munich, have been pursuing a private crap game, with luck being enough of a lady to offer them a route to the semi-finals via Paraguay and the United States, their opponents in Ulsan tomorrow. The Americans are no longer in the tournament simply for decorative purposes. Their competent, gutsy victory in the second round proved this, though it might have been different had Mexico not approached the match as if it was a movie by Sam Peckinpah. A German win is likely, in which case would Rudi V\u00f6ller rather meet Spain in the semi-finals following South Korea's latest thunderclap of a result in beating Italy? On present form the Spaniards may be lucky to get the chance of a tilt at Germany. Guus Hiddink's Koreans keep leaping on unsuspecting Europeans like Inspector Clouseau's oriental valet. To play against them, backed by such fervent, cacophonous support, must be akin to being swept up by a twister and deposited in the merry old land of Oz. It should be apparent by now that South Korea have not come thus far purely on adrenalin or because their opponents have been worn out by a long season in Europe or through an anti-Italian conspiracy masterminded by Fu Manchu. Not only are they fast and supremely fit; they can also play football rather well and, from the way Spain faded against the Republic of Ireland, a Korean presence in the last four is a clear possibility. The final in Yokohama, then, could be between Germany and Brazil or England but, should it be South Korea v Senegal, the World Cup could not say it was not warned. The television companies are probably hoping for Brazil against Germany, although Germany and England would be history revisited with a touch of irony thrown in. Sven-Goran Eriksson, meanwhile, will be less concerned with destiny than with Owen's groin strain, which is threatening to deprive England of the pace they need to unsettle Brazil's wobbly defence. Neither Owen nor Paul Scholes, who twisted an ankle against Denmark, took part in yesterday's practice session but both are expected to resume training this evening. The appointment of a Mexican referee, Felipe Ramos Rizo, tomorrow may give an indication of what sort of match England can expect. They can only hope he is more flexible than Jamaica's Peter Prendergast, who in Monday's game in Kobe treated Brazil as bone china and punished the mildest of Belgian challenges, which included disallowing a header from Marc Wilmots in the first half for nothing more than a brush with Roque Junior. This was the latest in a series of decisions that have gone Brazil's way stretching back through the South American qualifiers. In fact, Brazilians fear tomorrow's referee will over-compensate and go against them. England should be so lucky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
