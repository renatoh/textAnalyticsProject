Freddy Tylicki, who remains in intensive care with suspected spinal injuries of unknown gravity, was in the thoughts of those riders who returned here to keep racing\u2019s show on the road, comforting themselves with the fact that falls in Flat racing are rare. \u201cHopefully Freddy will be OK,\u201d said Pat Cosgrave, who had been on Tylicki\u2019s outside when the incident occurred on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a sobering experience. We\u2019re competitors on the track but we live together most of the day. When things like that happen, it\u2019s not about racing and it\u2019s not about money and it\u2019s not about horses winning or losing. It\u2019s about a bit of respect and hopefully the boys will be OK.\u201d Mercifully, it emerged that the other three riders involved in the pile-up had escaped without serious injury, including the new champion jockey of British Flat racing, Jim Crowley. He was treated on the track for more than an hour, yards from Tylicki, before being taken to hospital but was sent home on Monday night with no more than a broken nose. Steve Drowne, whose mount was also brought down, was uninjured. Ted Durcan, unseated in the melee, broke an ankle but, being as robust as any jockey, arranged to be driven to a hospital at Cambridge, near his home, before seeking treatment. The Injured Jockeys Fund, which is providing updates on Tylicki, said the 30-year-old was conscious and stable at St George\u2019s Hospital in Tooting. He was undergoing assessment and further news about his condition is expected on Wednesday. While an entire sport crossed its fingers for him, the workaday business of eight more races went ahead. John Egan, who was among the winners, expressed the robust philosophy of a veteran rider: \u201cYou know what, when something happens, it\u2019s like when someone dies: you say, \u2018Isn\u2019t it terrible! We should appreciate things...\u2019 Then you go out the door and you forget about that. Life goes on. And, sure, if it didn\u2019t, the whole world would be stopped a long, long time ago. \u201cI had a bad fall in Wolverhampton about seven years ago and they told me afterwards that I was actually clinically gone for, like, a minute. Listen, these tracks are real safe, I swear to God, but look, accidents happen. You could slip down the stairs and break your neck. What are you going to do, take the stairs out? It\u2019s one of them things, there was nobody to blame.\u201d Barney Clifford, a jump jockey in years gone by who now works as Kempton\u2019s racing director, was full of praise for the medical team who had attended Tylicki and Crowley, especially their \u201cmeticulous, brilliant\u201d leader, Dr Peter Johnson. \u201cWhat\u2019s so sharp now, which is the most important thing, is the response time,\u201d Clifford said. He spoke also of how his groundstaff \u201crose to the occasion\u201d in assisting the paramedics and said it was eight years since the last comparable incident at the venue. In the background was a concern among some that this incident had highlighted the particular risks of all-weather racing, with packed fields racing around tight ovals. \u201cIf you look at any all-weather racing, a good position is key,\u201d the trainer Michael Attwater said. \u201cEveryone wants to be on the inside on the bends, so everyone tightens up. It\u2019s so easy to make a mistake. A clip of the heels and it\u2019s a knock-on effect.\u201d However, Attwater accepts there is no obvious scope for improving safety. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with half a tonne of animal, 10 or 12 of them in a race and an eight\u2011stone jockey trying to guide them at 40mph. It\u2019s very hard to prevent anything ... unless every race is confined to four runners and even then it\u2019ll happen. I think the racecourses are as safe as they can be and obviously the paramedics were on hand so that everyone was dealt with quickly and that\u2019s as much as we can do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
