The major Japanese players use it to unveil products for both local and international markets. In typical style, Sony dominated with a huge stand that was home to its range of audio/visual and IT devices. However, genuine new product was rather thin on the ground. Instead, the Japanese got their first glimpse of the company's so-called TiVo-killer, the Vaio VGX-X90P. Due on sale next month in Japan for around \u00a32,500, the unit is a PC-based home video server that has four 250GB hard drives and three TV tuners, which enables it to record up to seven channels simultaneously. The Japanese also got to see the NW-HD2, the second incarnation of Sony's 20GB hard disk-based music player, available in three colours. After a few years of precious little innovation in flat screens, Sony hit back with the Qualia 005, an LCD set that boasts a unique array of light-emitting diodes called Triluminos, which Sony claims provides a far wider spectrum of colour than standard LCDs. LCD TV sets dominated the stand of rival manufacturer Sharp, where pride of place went to a 65in model, the world's biggest. At the other end of the scale, Sharp paraded the V602SH, a two megapixel camera phone with swivelling screen and a 2x optical zoom lens. It will be available in the UK in an altered format as Vodafone's flagship 3G handset, the V902SH. Also on display was the Sharp GX25, a mid-range GPRS clamshell phone with VGA camera that will go on sale in the UK shortly. Toshiba's stand was dominated by its range of hard disk-based technology, including its F Series GigaBeat MP3 players, due to launch in the UK in the spring. Toshiba also paraded its tiny 0.8in hard disk and showed how the disk could be integrated into a mobile phone to enable it to store video, audio and images. No Japanese consumer electronics show is complete without a robot or two. JVC obliged with J4, an upright red robot controlled via Bluetooth. It is being billed as a rival to Sony's similarly specified QRIO. Finally, a group of Japanese IT companies unveiled proposals for using light-emitting diodes - an upcoming standard for existing light fittings and traffic lights - to transmit data at high speeds over distances of up to 10 metres. The idea is that, in the future, someone trapped in a room could point their mobile at a light bulb and rescuers would know exactly where they are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
