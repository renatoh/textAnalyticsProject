As soon as Manchester United had clinched their place in Moscow Paul Scholes was at the forefront of Sir Alex Ferguson's thoughts. The manager declared that the 33-year-old would be the first name on the team sheet. He was not actually snuffling over Scholes's opportunity to get the medal he missed through suspension in 1999. The 25-yarder with which the midfielder had just overcome Barcelona was more germane. It was merely his second goal of the season, yet it had come at a critical moment. That was no surprise whatsoever. Scholes may be the best footballer to play in this country since the inception of the Premier League. There used to be many goals, from poacher's prod to tour de force. Of course, it also helps that he has imagination, a sense of the game's shape in the midst of tumult and perceptiveness in short or long passes. With Gary Neville limited to eight minutes' action this season and Ryan Giggs expected to be seated initially on the bench tomorrow, Scholes, at kick-off, will literally be the last man standing from that coruscating group of youngsters United once had. All the same, he does feel the ache of age and knee trouble kept him out for three months this season. \"I know there isn't much time left,\" he agreed recently. Scholes, with his career nearly completed, has earned the fondness that floods from the Old Trafford stands and beyond. Everybody is familiar with the alacrity with which he signed each new contract, the indifference to commercial opportunities and the stability of his personal life. Not long after one game had ended someone who hoped for a word with Scholes asked Rio Ferdinand if he was still around. \"You must be joking,\" said the defender. \"He'll be halfway home by now.\" All the testimony to the midfielder's ability and lack of affectation has been earned, but it is an incomplete account. Scholes has achieved so much because of an uncompromising streak on and off the park. Ill-judged as his tackling can be, he goes on hurling himself at opponents rather than limiting those sort of challenges. At times, it is the indulgence of referees, such as that of Steve Bennett at Wigan, that saves him from a red card. With a caution against him already, Scholes stopped Antonio Valencia from racing away with a professional foul. It should be borne in mind, too, that he missed the triumph over Bayern Munich nine years ago because of a two-footed foul in the semi-final with Juventus. There is nothing terribly strange about that sort of conduct, except that it can go unnoticed in a player who seems to live purely by talent. Scholes can only be what he is because of an all-encompassing desire to succeed and there is ruthlessness within it. Had that been lacking, we would never have heard of him at all. David Beckham's parents used to dread that he would not make the grade at Old Trafford because he was so small. He filled out remarkably, but Scholes did not develop in that way. Innate skill and sheer desire to succeed had to bridge the gap. Eric Harrison, who coached him as a youngster, recalled at the weekend that Scholes once had to stop playing for a while because of a knee condition but was even more lethal when allowed on to the field again. Very occasionally the hard-bitten side of Scholes can be witnessed. In November 2001 he refused to board the bus for a League Cup tie at Arsenal, where he would have been part of a shadow line-up, and was fined \u00a380,000. Immediately before that, he had not been in the starting line-up at Liverpool. Time has since vindicated Scholes's resentment, if not his conduct. United had been beaten at 3-1 at Anfield and finished third in the Premier League. Ferguson was experimenting with radical measures at the club and persisted with the \u00a328.1m Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n in the team. Magnificent as the Argentinian could be, he was not cut out for the domestic football to which Scholes was born. The latter does not compromise. At Euro 2004, where he was obliged to play on the left and cope with the effects of the climate on his asthma, Sven-Goran Eriksson fleetingly wondered if it would be better to recast the midfield quartet in diamond formation, with Scholes close behind the forwards. The scheme was examined on the training ground but abandoned because it did not suit the rest of the players. At the close of the tournament Scholes retired from international football and he has lately been deaf to Fabio Capello's request that he return. The midfielder did extend his career and secured more time at home by walking away from England, but perhaps he might have been cajoled into persevering had he been sure of the role that fitted him perfectly. There is obstinacy as much as flair at the core of Scholes. Why else would Ferguson be so keen to send him out against Chelsea tomorrow?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
