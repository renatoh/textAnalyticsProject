And will he be having another meal when he gets home? \"Oh, yeah. Shepherd's pie, probably,\" he speculates. Peace and quiet has descended on a large and echoing room in Aldecar community language college in Langley Mill, on the borders of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. It's \"snack-time\" at the after-school club, one of 500 run by Schoolfriend etc, the largest charitable provider of childcare in the country. This particular club is unique: it's the first to be housed in a secondary school. It is a pilot scheme to test the water for extending the service to 11- and 12-year-olds, already in secondary education. \"A lot of parents of children that age are not sure they want them going home alone yet,\" says Fiona Mortlock, head of childcare services at Schoolfriend. Along with the national youth manager, Lisa Blowditch, she's looking at the best way to attract year 7 and 8 pupils. In the meantime, Aldecar's ICT suite and all-weather playing field are being thrown open to children from the college's six feeder primaries, who arrive just after 4pm. By snack-time at 4.45, they've had chance to shrug off the school day in their own ways. Rather stereotypical ways, it must be said - the girls are mainly diligently drawing, colouring or making paper flowers. Most of the boys, meanwhile, are running about, letting off steam. During snack-time, however, they all sit down together. So, Callum, what do you think of the club so far? \"It's all right,\" he says. Abigail Peck, also eight, is more enthusiastic. \"I like to do art and things and colouring,\" she says, \"so it's good for me.\" So good, according to her mother, Michaela, \"that when I come to pick her up, she doesn't want to come home\". Recouping costs Schoolfriend etc (education, training, childcare) was set up in London by Amanda and Stephen Argent in 2003. Over the past four years, it has grown rapidly to deliver the government's extended schools agenda to some 80,000 children nationally, aged between four and 11. Their parents pay \u00a36.50 for each session, but much of that money can be claimed back through working tax credits. \"If you're in full-time work on the national minimum wage, you can reclaim 80% of your childcare costs,\" Mortlock points out. \"That's why this area is a good demographic for us. Most people are in low-paid work.\" The mines and mills that scarred this landscape in the early part of the 20th century had disappeared by its end. Unemployment has dropped markedly since the dark days of the late 80s and early 90s, but there remains an imperative to equip local children with skills for the jobs market. So, apart from being a specialist language college, Aldecar has a strong vocational curriculum. The principal, Tony Cooper, says: \"Our students have to do 50 days of placement in a work setting and this after-school club could fit the bill for some. They'll be mentors to the primary school children who'll be coming here as students eventually. It's going to seem a lot less intimidating for them if they already know somebody in years 10 or 11.\" Some of those students will even go on to get jobs with after-school clubs. Indeed, there's one here this afternoon, having completed her NVQ level 3 at Aldecar. She's sporting the bright orange T-shirt of Schoolfriend , which has a policy of employing one staff member for every eight children. What's more, there are men among the staff. \"It seems to be easier to get blokes into play work than into early years teaching,\" says Mortlock. Plenty of exercise Standing in the middle of the room, with a football under each arm, is Emilio Davola, who has a degree in sport and exercise sciences from Staffordshire University. He's the club's \"sports facilitator\" and he's about to encourage his charges to exercise limbs and lungs outside. But it's getting on for 5pm and parents are beginning to arrive. Cue tears from one or two children who don't want to go home. Jack Booker, seven, is distraught at having to miss the football training. \"Go on, then, Jack, we'll stay for half an hour,\" his mother sighs before trudging off to join the cluster of parents sheltering from a nippy wind whipping across grassed-over colliery waste. At least the children are soon warmed up, as Davola engages them in an elaborate game of tag before testing their dribbling skills. Abigail displays deft ball-control skills, and Jack manages to score in the bottom right-hand corner. Shouting encouragement from the sidelines is single father Martin Pavloff, who gave up his job at a local theme park to look after his two children. \"Come on, Francesca, tackle him,\" he bawls before breaking off to say: \"Too many kids are sitting in front of the telly or the computer screen after school. I like mine to get plenty of exercise.\" They've come to the right place, it would seem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
