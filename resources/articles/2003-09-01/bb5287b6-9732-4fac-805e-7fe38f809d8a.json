A year to the day since Estelle Morris, then education secretary, ordered an inquiry into A-level marking, Ken Boston, chief executive of the qualifications and curriculum authority, declared that a repeat of the 2002 debacle had been avoided. He spoke of the \"Dunkirk spirit\" of examiners and markers who rallied to the cause and delivered results successfully this summer. Speaking to the Joint Council for General Qualifications conference in Edinburgh today, Mr Boston said: \"I think it is now safe to say that the problems of last year have been avoided in 2003. Young people and their parents can be certain that the true value of their achievements have been recognised. \"There was something of the Dunkirk spirit about the way in which everyone rallied to the cause, more than 60,000 of them being markers.\" But he added: \"Our Dunkirk, like that in May 1940, was a real step towards victory, but not a victory in itself. \"While we were successful this year, it is now clearer than ever before that the examination and test system in England is not sustainable either operationally or financially as currently constituted,\" he said. Change was urgently necessary, said Mr Boston, if public examinations were to be delivered without the present unacceptably high levels of public risk and if A-levels were to endure as the \"rock underpinning our hopes and aspirations for the future of the 6 million young people who will reach 18 years of age over the next 10 years\", and if the costs of the exercise were to be held to acceptable levels. An examination board could be within hours of failure to deliver results, because of issues relating to scale, logistics and timeline, he said - more than 1 million students at A-level, AS or GCSE; attending 15 million examinations in 6,000 schools and colleges; their scripts distributed in the main by Royal Mail to 60,000 markers, and returned; and the awarding meetings held to finalise results, all within an eight-week examination period, twice a year. Mr Boston made it clear he wants radical change to enable markers to receive scripts randomly from across all centres rather than one school or college, and have markers specialising in answers to a limited range of questions instead of marking whole scripts. There should be more inbuilt detection mechanisms to spot aberrant marking. Above all instead of 25 million paper scripts crisscrossing the country by post, they should be distributed electronically or dealt with in marking centres. There were still unacceptable losses of scripts and late entries. Mr Boston said QCA was setting up six modernisation programmes, after consultation with the examination boards and the teacher and headteacher associations. PriceWaterhouseCoopers is to undertake a detailed financial analysis of the examinations system, \"to tell us what it actually costs to run\" - possibly more than \u00a3750m a year. \"Currently, there is no clarity about how much England actually spends on examinations and tests, what it is spent on, and where it comes from,\" he said. Exam boards were reporting deficits but the cost to schools and colleges had soared to \"clearly unacceptable levels\". The second programme is about building a national pool of examiners, paying them and training them properly, and leveraging recruitment and retention programmes nationally, taking up the proposal from the Secondary Heads Association for a body such as an Institute of Chartered Examiners, he said. The third programme is to reduce the administrative burden on the examination offices in schools and colleges. \"We need to move quickly to achieve convergence in the paperwork, processes and systems of the three major awarding bodies in England, so that requirements for schools become significantly less complex. The fourth programme is to move from a paper-based system in examination offices, to a system that is based on electronic communication. The fifth programme is aimed at making the physical logistics for the movement of scripts and other material much more robust: collection and delivery by courier, bar-coding of bundles, a tracking system that will provide accurate information online about the location and stage of processing of all papers and scripts. The final programme is about replacing the movement of a substantial number of scripts by electronic imagery, or the scanning of scripts, which can be manipulated and marked on screen. \"As well as increasing security, this offers the prospect of early detection of aberrant marking (because the same script can be distributed to different markers by a second examiner); it randomises the delivery of scripts, rather than a single examiner receiving all the scripts from the one school; and it allows the various answers on a script to be split up between different examiners,\" said Mr Boston. He vehemently denied that the QCA and the exam boards had lowered standards in some subjects to allow government targets to be met. The accusation was \"not only untrue, but professionally offensive\". He added: \"There is no pressure from government, either overt or covert, on examination boards or regulatory authorities to contrive a politically convenient result.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
