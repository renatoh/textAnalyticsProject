A report into Britain's biggest oil company had just seriously criticised its safety record and the political bruiser appeared to have presided over the eclipse of the BP chief executive, Lord Browne, the Sun King of the corporate world. Clouds had gathered beforehand, with a series of ground rules for the interview, beginning with a warning that Sutherland would limit his comments to global trade and ending with an edict to check all quotes. I arrived expecting a fight, only for Sutherland, a man whose exterior fits his tough-guy reputation, to immediately dismiss the quote-checking: \"Ah, I couldn't care less about that.\" He smiled, extending a hand. The charming, garrulous Irishman was keen to talk about the vexed issue of the long-stalled Doha round of world trade talks, amid raised hopes that there could be a breakthrough at next week's World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort town of Davos. He had never given an interview in his capacity as BP chairman since his appointment 10 years ago, he said, and was naturally determined not to talk about the beleaguered oil group amid this week's travails and after a year in which it had struggled to deal with America's worst corporate accident in a decade, allegations of trading irregularities and oil spills in Alaska. But on just two issues he could not help himself clarifying the situation, nor indeed checking the quotes: his own position as BP chairman with a commitment to stay until the new chief executive, Tony Hayward, was settled in, and on the legal ramifications of the Baker safety report. He said reports that he had called the investigation \"harsh\" made him sound more strident than he felt. \"It was harsh in places ... but actually ... I'm not complaining.\" He was furious at a report suggesting the board he chaired throughout the saga was in any way accountable for safety procedures. \"It does not make any suggestion of legal failure on the part of the board.\" Eruptions The sudden eruptions at BP contrast with the glacial pace of talks to bring in new rules for global trade. The latest round began in Doha, the Qatari capital, in 2001, but were suspended amid much acrimony last July. As the youngest person to become Irish attorney general, then going on to become the founding director general of the World Trade Organisation, the rugby-loving Sutherland is astonishingly successful in both corporate and public worlds. He also finds time to chair the international office of Goldman Sachs. Yet it is clear where his heart lies. Asked if he misses public office he says: \"Absolutely. But, you know, I've had my day.\" The comment seems so at odds with his continuing ambition and reputation and the fact that he is not yet 61 that we keep returning to it, especially when he says: \"I will no longer have a corporate interest after I retire from my corporate activities. But I'm going to stay in the public space.\" Credited with negotiating what is considered the most successful trade round in 1994, he is expected to be involved in next week's high-level Davos meeting between 20 main countries. He can best be described as an energetic pessimist on the bedevilled talks, admitting he is \"not hopeful\", given the entrenched positions on agricultural subsidies, particularly, though not only, in the US and Europe. \"I consider that there is a grave risk the political will needed on either side of the Atlantic to achieve a breakthrough is not there,\" he says. \"Nothing, including [recent] White House rhetoric, gives me great confidence a breakthrough will take place.\" Davos could represent a last-ditch chance to save the talks, and you feel, listening to Sutherland, save the world. As well as the economic health of countries in Asia, Africa and south America, Sutherland believes the collapse of the Doha round would destroy the entire system of multi-lateral agreements. \"There is so much danger of giving impetus to this protectionism [he almost spits the word] that will spread into things like migration. It's a whole mentality to a world that is changing that will spread into the environment and political issues that go way beyond trade.\" The great thing about listening to him talk about globalisation is that he is both incredibly passionate and yet full of hard-headed compromises to make it work. His success in doing so has either made him a saviour of many of the world's poorest people or their nemesis, depending on your point of view. \"Globalisation is a dirty word in France,\" he admits. \"Yet I see globalisation as a moral imperative. I don't mean unrestrained trade. The WTO has always been about balanced liberalisation, where the balance of obligation falls on richer countries.\" The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he says, has ensured that more people have become free from abject poverty in the past 10 years than at any other time in the past century. He calls opposition to greater globalisation \"morally indefensible\", and in words I struggle to keep up with even listening back on tape, he goes on: \"It is ludicrous that agriculture, a diminishing participant in the economic reality on both sides of the Atlantic, should be the break point when there is so much at risk.\" Ever the realist, Sutherland believes the way to salvage the talks could be to go for a less ambitious trade round, perhaps leaving the Gordian knot of agriculture aside. \"We can at least pocket the things we have on the table,\" he says. One way to do this would be for the WTO head, Pascal Lamy, to draw up a draft deal for all sides to work on. The option has so far been rejected, notably by the Frenchman himself, largely because of the distance between the sides. \"What's the downside at the end of the day, if we're getting nowhere?\" is Sutherland's response. He is careful to avoid suggesting Lamy is not doing a good job. \"It is not within the power of any one individual to conclude agreements; even one as capable as Pascal Lamy can't wave a magic wand.\" He readily accepts that political difficulties on both sides have made the job far tougher. In the mid 1990s, he says, John Major, then prime minister, and his opposite numbers Helmut Kohl and Bill Clinton, \"believed in globalisation for political as well as economic reasons\". In contrast to the \"absolutely committed\" Clinton, President Bush recently referred to the trade talks as the Darfur round, a malapropism that confused two very different conflicts. Sutherland's concern for the world's disenfranchised might sit a little uneasily with his position as head of one of the world's biggest oil groups and of its most successful investment bank. Yet he sees no conflict. \"I don't consider them to be in any way immoral or operating contrary to the common good.\" They have continued to give him influence on the world stage. Last month he added to his illustrious CV the title Consultor of the Extraordinary Section of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See. In other words, financial adviser to the Pope. He has also made a lot of money since 1995. He was reported to have made \u00a3125m from the 1999 flotation of Goldman Sachs. He lives in London with his wife of 35 years and three children, one of whom works for the Irish commission in Brussels. But he still calls Dublin home. Describing himself as \"passionately Irish\", he accepted an honorary knighthood even though his date of birth meant he could have accepted a gong with a title attached. Perhaps ironically, his position at BP was whispered to be one factor for the French refusal to back his candidacy for the head of the European commission, most recently two years ago - he has been tipped for the job three times. He admits to only two regrets: one is that he never played rugby for Ireland (he was a successful prop forward) and the other is that he never got that top job. \"The thing I've wanted to run all my life was Europe but I don't think that will happen. It's just such a great idea. Europe for me is the most noble political process in 1,000 years.\" He still has political ambitions but prefaces them by calling them unrealistic. \"I'd love to be foreign minister of Europe but there are a hell of a lot of foreign ministers [who would like the job].\" He was asked by Kofi Annan, the outgoing head of the United Nations, to be his special representative for migration. It's a $1-a-year job he obviously loves but which could end this summer. Having already extended my allotted time, his parting words are guaranteed to gladden the heart of any journalist about to go to Davos. \"Let me know if you need any help or introductions. Just don't expect too much in terms of electronic communication.\" He is indeed far better in person than via intermediaries.
