The Nocturne and Tarantella Op 28 and the set of three Mythes Op 30 were composed in the same year, 1915, when Szymanowski's music was still in thrall to the impressionism of Debussy and Ravel - but they are sharply contrasted. Both works demand performers who can command a vast range of texture and nuance. Here, Alina Ibragimova and C\u00e9dric Tiberghien produce beautifully characterised accounts, whether in the veiled contours of the Nocturne and the explosion of rhythmic energy that follows it in the Tarantella, or in the refined exoticism of Mythes, with its strange mixture of classical evocation and sensuous indulgence. While Szymanowski's models remain obvious, this is music that is coloured indelibly with a very particular sensibility. Ibragimova and Tiberghien bring it marvellously to life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
