I can\u2019t believe I just saw it on screen.\u2019\u201d Women who have abortions are only just now beginning to see themselves depicted on screens, but for a certain subgroup \u2013 women who are already mothers when they decide to terminate \u2013 the taboo is stronger than ever. It\u2019s a taboo that Scheller\u2019s low-key comedy was determined to quietly break. The Letdown follows Audrey: a middle-class woman, played by Scheller\u2019s collaborator Alison Bell, who is adjusting to life after childbirth with a clumsy, fumbling grace. The show has been greeted warmly by critics and fans for its raw depiction of new motherhood, and in its second season Bell and Scheller wanted to dial up the darkness and realism. But when Scheller began testing out a new plotline \u2013 Audrey\u2019s next pregnancy, terminated by abortion \u2013 friends she told about it were horrified, saying, \u201c\u2018Oh no, don\u2019t do that!\u2019\u201d It proved Scheller\u2019s hunch: this story needed to be told, and without the trauma or fear that colours so many onscreen abortion tales. \u201cMothers have more abortions than anyone else,\u201d says Scheller down the line from Los Angeles, where she\u2019s now based thanks to the global recognition of her show. \u201cSo why is this still so taboo?\u201d Australian data \u2013 thought scant \u2013 shows the same trend: that women in their late 20s and 30s are far more likely to have abortions than teenagers; and that mothers, educated women and happily married couples get abortions too. Perhaps we need a dose of dark humour to process and normalise taboo, yet commonplace experiences. In 2015, Lena Dunham\u2019s Girls had a decidedly chill non-revelation about an abortion. The morbidly funny web series Ctrl Alt Delete even relocates its zippy workplace comedy to an abortion clinic, with mothers receiving what doctors call an \u201cevacuation of the uterus\u201d. Earlier this year, Netflix\u2019s UK sex-positive comedy Sex Education took a de-stigmatising view of abortion as a part of life, but it also doubled down on one lasting TV cliche: the disadvantaged, pink-haired teenager (played by Emma Mackey), walking into an abortion clinic without a boyfriend or stable family unit. The Letdown\u2019s termination plot couldn\u2019t look more different. This time, in a story TV rarely tells, the protagonist is a parent in her 30s, with a partner, a career, a mortgaged house full of Ikea furniture \u2013 and an accidental foetus in her uterus. She chooses to end the pregnancy, and then moves through the steps of getting on with her life. In all these shows, termination is a serious decision \u2013 but not a tormented, regretful one. It is what it is: a safe, simple medical procedure that for most women produces no lasting shock. Scheller references a scene from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, in which a doorbell rings and the son of a lawyer casually calls out: \u201cMom, I\u2019ll get it since you just had an abortion.\u201d Real-life conversations are rarely so candid. In The Letdown, Audrey feels an ambiguous grief, compounded by her mother\u2019s observation that abortion is \u201ca very solitary experience\u201d. That tearful place of murky loss or non-loss, coupled with lonely silence, speaks clearly to a gap between progressive ideals (that nobody should be ashamed to end a pregnancy) and the difficult reality of talking freely about such a taboo and complicated subject. \u201cIn our writers\u2019 room, we got [Australian feminist commentator] Clementine Ford in to talk about this specific issue. She was saying that the pro-lifers never consider the [quality of life of the] kids you have after an abortion. I wouldn\u2019t have the two children I have now if I hadn\u2019t been able to access that abortion then,\u201d Scheller says, referring to a pregnancy she terminated in her 20s. The decision, she says, gave her the capacity to be a better mother later in life. \u201cAudrey\u2019s arc is about coming to a point where she doesn\u2019t feel shame about her decision. She tells the other mums \u2026 as well as telling her own partner to stop tippy-toeing around talking about it afterwards. It\u2019s actually not a big deal. Most women deal with their terminations pretty well. Audrey was assertive, her character drove the decision, she had agency. There\u2019s no judgment, at all.\u201d Still, the ABC felt the need to mitigate the risk of blowback. \u201cThe ABC wanted us to lean into the medical side of things,\u201d she says, referring to Audrey\u2019s first birth \u2013 an emergency Cesarean which made a second pregnancy too dangerous too soon. This framed Audrey\u2019s abortion as simply a form of healthcare, rather than an emotional, moral or lifestyle decision. But Scheller and Bell wanted to show the validity of other reasons for terminations. In a scene of cross-generational solidarity, Audrey\u2019s mother Verity (Sarah Peirse) reveals that she ended a badly timed pregnancy decades ago so as not to limit the trajectory of her life and her relationship. Both experiences are presented as legitimate. The Letdown\u2019s second season will be released in July on Netflix in the United States, home to what Scheller calls a \u201cfrightening\u201d backlash against abortion rights. Weeks after president Donald Trump falsely referred to terminations as executions, the state of Alabama passed a law which criminalises almost all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest. And yet it was US TV that aired one of the first onscreen instances of a mother choosing to terminate. \u201cWe were quite inspired by the series Maude,\u201d says Scheller. \u201cThey had an abortion storyline in 1972, where Maude, a 47-year-old mother played by Bea Arthur, fell pregnant in New York, where it was legal to have an abortion. The double episode, Maude\u2019s Dilemma, aired before Roe v Wade. It was so groundbreaking. The show\u2019s creator Norman Lear says that it aired in 1972 without controversy. It wasn\u2019t until the reruns in the 1980s, when the religious right had really exploded, that there were thousands of letters of complaint.\u201d In that way, it\u2019s not just the representation of abortion that matters, but the cultural and political climate around them. In today\u2019s loaded context, the capacity of comedy to normalising how we talk about abortions continues. \u201cIf we can\u2019t laugh at it,\u201d says Scheller, \u201cthen it\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d And that would just be a nightmare. \u2022 The Letdown is streaming on ABC iView"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
