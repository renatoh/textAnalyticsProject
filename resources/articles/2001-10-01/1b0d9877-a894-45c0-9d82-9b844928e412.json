The transport secretary, Stephen Byers, the education secretary, Estelle Morris, and the health secretary, Alan Milburn, were fielded at the annual Labour party conference to face random questions from delegates on the floor, in a bid to reassure party members. The session - which lasted 90 minutes and took more than 30 questions - only caught fire, however, when a delegate from the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen called for the renationalisation of Railtrack, to huge cheers from the floor. Mr Byers ruled that out, but did reveal there would be new tram systems for regional cities announced in the autumn. He also revealed that when Tony Blair reshuffled his cabinet in June, and gave Mr Byers the transport brief, \"the words chalice and poisoned came to mind\". He did, however, pledge to delegates that if the health and safety executive decided that the private bids for the London underground were not safe, he would not go ahead with the scheme. Mr Byers also promised greater powers for local authorities in the forthcoming white paper, joking that he would not, as a 26-year old now, become a local councillor, as he himself did in Newcastle in 1980. On the hot topic of city mayors, Mr Byers, whose responsibilities also cover local government, revealed that he was willing to use central government's powers to impose referendums if people wanted them. Mr Milburn rejected criticism that the new star ratings for hospitals were meaningless, telling delegates that he had personally predicted 10 of the 12 worst hospitals from complaints he received from patients. He also drew cheers from the floor by explicitly stating: \"The problem with the NHS is managers. It is not technicians, porters, nurses or doctors, it is managers.\" Mr Milburn rejected criticism that the star system reflected local deprivation, saying: \"My local hospital in South Tyneside is one of the best in the country. One of the worst hospitals is in Surrey. \"We have got to change the management.\" No delegate really managed to land a blow on the ministers - partly because the questions were grouped together in threes, fours and even fives, to avoid direct confrontation. Pressed by delegates, the panel could not be drawn on examples of school and hospital outsourcing that had proved effective. Ms Morris claimed that services such as payroll and personnel could be more effectively bought in. Ms Morris said: \"Teachers spend too much time cleaning classrooms, collecting dinner money, sharpening pencils and on break supervision.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
