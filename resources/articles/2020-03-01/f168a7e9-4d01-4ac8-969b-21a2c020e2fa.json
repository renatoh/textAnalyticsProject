Here\u2019s the latest summary of the key events: Scotland has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, bringing the UK total up to 36. Thirteen of those have been confirmed today alone. A man in Essex became the second person in the UK to be infected with the virus without traveling abroad. A group of Britons who have been on lockdown in a hotel in Tenerife since Tuesday have arrived at the airport to fly home. Dozens of Brits remain inside. The number of cases in Germany has doubled in the last day, and a further 30 cases were announced in France since Saturday, bringing its total up to 130. In Italy, the head of the country\u2019s civil protection agency has confirmed the death toll now stands at 34, five more than a yesterday, while the number of infections has risen 50% to 1,694. New cases have appeared in Chicago and Rhode Island in the US. Non-essential British embassy staff have been withdrawn from Tehran with immediate effect. The death toll in Iran is currently at 54, with 978 confirmed cases. The husband of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is being held on spying charges in Iran, believes she has contracted coronavirus in prison but says officials are refusing to test her. Australia\u2019s number of confirmed cases has been increased to 29, after a ninth case appeared in Victoria. Israel has confirmed another three cases, two of which were patients who recently returned from Italy but the other was caught locally. This bring\u2019s the country\u2019s total number to 10. The first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the Dominican Republic, a tourist visiting from Italy. A fifth case has appeared in Mexico \u2013 a young woman who was studying in Milan, Italy, but reportedly returned home to Mexico when her school was shut down because of the virus. You can follow our latest liveblog here: Christopher Betts, 73, is a British holidaymaker who is still in lockdown in the hotel in Tenerife. He arrived at the hotel with his wife on the 18th, and was due to be leaving on the morning the hotel went into quarantine. Christopher told the Guardian he has been tested for coronavirus but hasn\u2019t received his results, and has no idea when he\u2019ll be able to fly home. One of his friends in the hotel is in regular contact with the Foreign Office, and says he\u2019s being told different things depending on which member of staff he speaks to there. \u201cOne branch of Foreign Office says that when you\u2019re negative you can go, another branch says you have to stay for the full isolation period, until March 10,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re operating on a Chinese whispers system. If we have to stop til next Tuesday, fine, we\u2019ll accept it. all we need is clarification.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re getting conflicting stories from our government. Finish and Dutch people in the hotel have said their government have been clear about them staying until the 10th, but we don\u2019t know,\u201d he added. Those who test negative will have to retest when the time comes to fly home, and must leave 24 hours after their negative result. Christopher is concerned that if the remaining Brits are allowed to leave the hotel, they won\u2019t be able to get transport to the airport. He praised the staff at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace for their hospitality during the quarantine period. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t wish for a better hotel,\u201d he said. \u201cStaff and guests were dancing in the restaurant last night, they brought us entertainment. I know people whinge, but you couldn\u2019t wish for anything more under the circumstances. They\u2019re even giving us free drinks.\u201d Israel has confirmed three more cases of coronavirus, bringing its total number to 10. Two of the new cases had recently returned from a trip to Italy, and the third is thought to have been infected within Israel. The three patients have \u201clight\u201d symptoms, Israel\u2019s health ministry said. PA have produced a helpful overview of the UK coronavirus cases, which might help to map out what\u2019s happened so far: 31 January The first cases are reported in the UK when two members of the same family test positive for the virus. They had recently travelled to the UK from China. They were staying at a hotel in York when they fell ill and were taken to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment. 6 February A third person in the UK is diagnosed in Brighton and transferred to Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 in London. It later emerges that the patient, businessman Steve Walsh, contracted the virus at a conference in Singapore. On his way back to the UK, he stopped off for several days at a French ski chalet, where five Britons were subsequently infected with the virus. 9 February Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says a fourth person has been diagnosed in the UK, believed to be a contact of Walsh. It is later confirmed that the virus was passed on in France. 10 February Four more patients in England test positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight. Those infected are all contacts of Walsh and Public Health England (PHE) confirms two are healthcare workers. The four newly diagnosed people had contracted the virus in France. 13 February A woman in London becomes the ninth person to test positive for the illness in the UK - the first confirmed case in the capital. The patient, also moved to Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, contracted the virus in China, Whitty says. As with previously confirmed cases, officials work to identify people who had been in recent contact with the woman. 23 February Four Britons rescued from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan test positive for the illness in the UK, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 13. They were among a group of 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who arrived at a quarantine block at Arrowe Park hospital in Merseyside a day earlier. Whitty said the virus was passed on when all four were on board the vessel. 27 February The first case of Covid-19 is diagnosed in Northern Ireland, while two more people tested positive across the rest of the UK. The patient in Belfast had recently returned from northern Italy and had previously been in Dublin. Another of the new cases, a parent at a Buxton primary school in Derbyshire, contracted the virus in Tenerife. The third patient also contracted the virus in Italy. 28 February The number of confirmed UK cases jumps to 20 after Wales reports its first patient and three more are identified in England. Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales confirmed a man had been diagnosed with the virus after travelling back to Wales from Italy. Two of the new cases identified in England had recently travelled back from Iran. Meanwhile, a patient identified in Surrey becomes the first to catch the illness within the UK. Prof Whitty says it is not clear if the patient had contracted the virus \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad. 29 February Three more patients are identified in England. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy while the other had returned from Asia. 1 March The UK total climbs to 36 after 13 new patients are identified, with Scotland reporting its first case. Three of the latest cases in England are family members of a man from Surrey who was the first to catch the illness within the UK. All four are adults, including one more from Surrey and two from West Sussex, and are not GPs or health workers, acting regional director for the south of England for PHE says. Another new patient, from Essex, had no relevant travel to an affected area, according to Whitty, and it was unclear whether the patient had contracted it \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad. The eight remaining cases include one from Bury, Greater Manchester, who was infected in Italy, two new patients from Hertfordshire and one in London. Three cases were confirmed in West Yorkshire, including two Leeds residents \u2013 who became infected in Iran \u2013 while one is from Bradford who had been in Italy. Another is from Gloucestershire and is linked to a member of staff at a school in the Cotswolds, identified the day before. Meanwhile, the first person in Scotland to be diagnosed is a Tayside resident who recently travelled from Italy. Nicola Sturgeon: \u2018Scottish coronavirus case not unexpected\u2019 Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first confirmed case in Scotland was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d. In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago, said they had been preparing for this occasion \u201cfor some time\u201d and that she was expecting more cases in the coming days and weeks. Sturgeon reiterated much of her earlier statement, and said the Scottish coronavirus patient is clinically well. Confident in the NHS response The first minister also assured the public that the UK was well-equipped to deal with a rise in cases. \u201cAll the things that should be done are being done\u201d, she said. \u201cWe have to be prepared for a significant outbreak fo coronavirus.\u201d She said that Scotland remained in the containment phase, and was focusing on trying to limit and contain spread of infection - which was \u201cparticularly important given the lack of coronavirus vaccine\u201d. The first minister said that wider planning for a significant outbreak in coming weeks was underway, including escalation plans for the NHS. \u201cI have a lot of confidence in the plans and procedures that are in place,\u201d she said. She said that steps that will be taken will be informed and guided by best possible advice, and that she wouldn\u2019t rule anything out at this stage. However, she also said that the public \u201chave a big part to play\u201d in stopping the spread of the virus by following public health guidelines. Sturgeon said that Scotland was working with other UK nations, and described it as \u201cvital\u201d to have a co-ordinated, UK wide response. \u201cThis is a virus that will not respect boundaries,\u201d she said. You can read more about the new cases in the US from my colleague Amanda Holpuch in New York. Brazil has so far confirmed only two cases of coronavirus - both Brazillian citizens who had been in Italy. But a report in one of the country\u2019s leading newspapers this Sunday says there are now 252 suspected cases - 136 of them in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo and 19 in Rio de Janeiro. According to the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, the suspected cases are people who have not just symptoms but have also had contact with a suspected case or a travel history connected to coronavirus. Angola has announced that it will ban citizens from China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Nigeria, Egypt and Algeria from entering the country. The ban will only apply to those who have travelled directly from those countries, and has been implemented to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Mexico have confirmed a fifth case of the virus - an 18-year-old woman who had been studying in Milan and had recently returned to Chiapas state. The woman tested positive for the virus on Saturday but is asymptomatic, state health authorities said. Authorities said she had returned to Mexico after her school in Italy closed because of the crisis. Two of Mexico\u2019s confirmed cases are in the capital, Mexico City, where schools and nurseries are already starting to adopt special measures to guard against a potential outbreak. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said there were currently no plans to cancel major public events or gatherings because of coronavirus. A nursing home near Seattle is on lockdown after a 70 year old resident and a worker in her 40s tested positive for coronavirus, officials at the home have said. State officials said that an additional 27 residents of the nursing home and 25 staff members are reporting symptoms of the virus, which can be similar to that of the common flu. The Life Care Center of Kirkland is not accepting new patients or allowing visitors, family or vendors into the facility. \u201cConcerned family members or responsible parties may call our facility,\u201d the release posted on its website said. \u201cThe facility is currently placing a hold on admissions as well to fully focus on our current residents and associates.\u201d The two cases were confirmed on Saturday by Washington state officials. The resident is in a serious condition, whilst the worker is in a \u2018satisfactory\u2019 condition. There are around 70 cases in the US. A woman who recently returned from Iran has today been confirmed as the ninth case of coronavirus in the Australian state of Victoria. Australia recorded its first death from Covid-19 on Sunday when a man in his late 70s, who had been evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, died in hospital in Perth. Seven cases from Victoria have recovered and are no longer in isolation. The eighth confirmed case is in a stable condition and is isolated and recovering in hospital. The ninth case, a woman in her 30s from Victoria who returned from Tehran, is recovering in isolation at home. The woman became unwell on February 27 while travelling to Melbourne from Tehran, via Kuala Lumpur and Bali. She travelled on Malindo Air on flight number OD177 and landed in Melbourne on 28 February at 6.04am. The Victorian department of health is following up close contacts on the plane. Across Australia, there have now been 29 confirmed cases: 9 in Queensland 6 in New South Wales 9 in Victoria 3 in South Australia 2 in Western Australia Out of these, 15 have recovered, one has died and the rest are in a stable condition. A coach of Britons who have been in lockdown in a hotel in Tenerife since Tuesday have arrived at an airport terminal to fly home. It is understood that the Brits have been booked on two different flights back to the UK, and they will have to self-isolate on their return. There are still dozens of Brits still inside the hotel, and it is unclear who has been allowed to leave and why. One told Sky News that it was based on \u201cpotluck\u201d according to travel providers. Tests for coronavirus on Brits in the hotel began yesterday and continued in to today. According to Sky New, the Brits were told that if they tested negative, they had 24 hours to get on a flight. One of those leaving said at the airport that he was feeling \u201crelieved\u201d and another praised the hotel staff as \u201cfantastic.\u201d The first person in Scotland has tested positive for coronavirus. The announcement brings the total number of UK cases to 36, 13 of which have been confirmed today. The patient, who is a resident of the Tayside area and had recently travelled from Italy, has now been admitted to hospital and is receiving treatment in isolation. Clinicians have also started to gather details of the places they have visited and the people they have been in contact with since they returned to the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has chaired a meeting of the Scottish government resilience committee this evening, and will be taking part in a similar one chaired by Boris Johnson tomorrow morning. Sturgeon said: \u201cOur first thoughts must be with the patient diagnosed with coronavirus, I wish them a speedy recovery. \u201cScotland is well-prepared for a significant outbreak of coronavirus but there is currently no treatment or vaccine. Early detection measures will continue to be vital in helping to prevent the spread of the virus. \u201cPeople have a vital role to play in helping us contain any outbreak by following the latest health and travel advice, and following basic hygiene precautions, such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.\u201d There have been a total of 698 negative test results in Scotland since the outbreak began. According to Reuters, organisers have said that a conference on the world economy due to take in Italy later this month with Pope Francis taking part has been postponed until November because of the outbreak. Some Britons in the hotel in Tenerife have been allowed to leave, Sky News have said. The number of people in Germany infected rose to 129 on Sunday, up from 66 on Saturday, DW has reported. Nine of Germany\u2019s 16 states now have cases of COVID-19, with Frankfurt, Hamburg and Bremen among the cities reporting their first infections, Germany\u2019s centre for disease control and prevention, the Robert Koch Institute, said. Almost half of the cases, 74 in total, have been confirmed in North Rhine-Westphalia, which is Germany\u2019s most populous state. Bavaria has the next highest number of confirmed cases, with 23, followed by Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg with 15. The Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said people should \u201cstill go about their business\u201d, but that the government was \u201cconsidering all options\u201d. In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago, he insisted the government\u2019s plan was \u201cvery clear\u201d. What are the government\u2019s steps? Firstly, the government are trying to contain the virus, he said. This meant that \u201cevery single case found here gets immediate treatment\u201d, with their contacts tracked down and given medical advice or checks. Hancock said that the government were trying to delay the onset of the virus, having determined that the UK would be better able to cope with a mass spread of coronavirus in the summer. He also said that the government had invested \u00a340 million into finding a vaccine and treatments for disease. He warned that a vaccine was \u201cstill many months off\u201d even with an accelerated process, but treatments for those who have virus already were \u201cmore optimistic\u201d. What should the public do? When asked if people should follow World Health Organisation advice to other parts of the world that over 60s should avoid shared spaces, he said no, as the cases were still \u201crelatively low\u201d. \u201cIf we get to a position where this is endemic around the world and large scale here, we will change advice,\u201d he added. He also said that stopping flights from China was not the answer, comparing it to Italy, who did stop flights and have much higher numbers of cases than the UK. He echoed Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s earlier statement that the best thing the public can do is wash their hands for 20 seconds. As Johnson referenced earlier, albeit slightly less clearly, the government are telling children to sing \u2018happy birthday\u2019 whilst washing their hands to ensure they wash for long enough. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said there needed to be \u201cmore direction from the Prime Minister\u201d and accused him of being slow to organise COBRA meetings - the government\u2019s emergency response committee. He said that the NHS were \u201creally doing their best\u201d and that clinicians would \u201calways rise to the challenge\u201d. However, he alleged that 80% of the beds needed for coronavirus were already taken up, saying that years of austerity meant resources to tackle the spread of the virus are stretched. Non-essential British embassy staff in Tehran are being withdrawn with immediate effect due to the virus, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has confirmed. The FCO also warned that the embassy\u2019s help to British nationals in Iran would be limited. A statement said: \u201cAs of 1 March, dependants and some staff from the British Embassy are being withdrawn from Iran due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain. \u201cIn the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited.\u201d The director general of France\u2019s health service, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, has given the latest figures and there\u2019s another leap on Sunday. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 130, from 100. Of that, 116 people are in hospital \u2013 nine of them in a serious condition \u2013 and 12 people recovered. There have been two deaths New cases include two children, a one-year-old and a five-year-old, who have been hospitalised in Strasbourg in eastern France along with their 27-year-old mother who also tested positive. Their condition has been described as not worrying. Salomon says French travellers should avoid journeys abroad outside the European Union \u201cunless strictly necessary\u201d. Nevertheless, he pointed out the death rate worldwide is 3.4% of confirmed cases. The Manga and Sci-Fi Show salon planned for next week in Paris, which was to have featured giant karaoke and K Pop concerts, has been cancelled. The Trump administration has accused the public of overreacting to the impact of the coronavirus on the economy, and insisted that stocks would bounce back. The S&amp;P 500 index dropped 11.5% last week as coronavirus spread - the worst weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. \u201cThe stock market that saw some downturns this week, it will come back,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the government\u2019s response to the virus, told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThe fundamentals of this economy are strong.\u201d he added. Pence also said the government was doing \u201ceverything possible\u201d to prevent the virus from spreading and that he was \u201cconfident\u201d the United States was prepared. U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News Sunday that the public was over-reacting to the current threat. The situation in the US A Washington man in his 50s with underlying health conditions was the first American to die from the virus, officials confirmed on Saturday. How the man contracted the virus is still not known. Over the weekend, new cases were confirmed in Chicago and Rhode Island. Morocco is set to postpone sports and cultural events over coronavirus fears, the government health committee has announced. It\u2019s currently unclear how widespread this measure will be. Morocco says it has tested 25 people suspected of having the coronavirus but all have been negative, and the country does not have any confirmed cases. Oman has suspended Italian tourist flights from Salala airport for a month, in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. Qatar has also announced a temporary ban on visitors from Egypt via intermediate points, the state news agency reported on Sunday. Two new cases were confirmed in Qatar on Sunday, bringing its total to 3. A school in Dublin is set to close for two weeks after a student tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Irish Times. The teenager is the first person in the Republic of Ireland to test positive for the virus, and the case was announced on Saturday evening. The individual became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is currently in isolation in a Dublin hospital. Students at the school are being told to self-isolate at home if they start presenting symptoms. Andrew Tatem, professor within geography and environmental science at the University of Southampton, has warned that the recent imported cases of coronavirus into China are indicative of a \u201cmove towards a global pandemic\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a stage now where China\u2019s major efforts to stop the outbreak within its borders have meant that it likely has stronger coronavirus surveillance and detection capabilities than anywhere else in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that China is now detecting and reporting imported cases that are coming from Iran and the UK is an indication of how the geographical balance of this outbreak is shifting as we seemingly move towards a global pandemic.\u201d The Dominican Republic has confirmed its first case of coronavirus \u2013 a tourist visiting the country from Italy. The patient is a 62-year-old man, who is in a stable condition. He has been taken to an isolation room in a military hospital near the capital, the country\u2019s health minister, Rafael Sanchez, said at a press conference. Another tourist, a 56-year-old man from France, is under observation at hospital and awaiting test results for coronavirus. On Friday, the Dominican Republic cancelled all flights from Milan for 30 days. The government also said that all travellers retuning from Italy would have to undergo epidemiological reviews at airports. Speaking at a laboratory at the Public Health England national infection service in Colindale, north London, Boris Johnson praised the work of PHE. He said there were likely to be more cases of coronavirus but said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great plan to tackle the spread of coronavirus and I\u2019m confident that in the NHS we\u2019ve got professionals who are able to cope with it.\u201d He also gave tips for stopping the spread of coronavirus: \u201cThe best way we can help the NHS and help ourselves to stop the spread of the illness is to wash our hands. It\u2019s 20 seconds, it\u2019s two times happy birthday. With hot water and soap.\u201d The prime minister will be chairing another Cobra meeting on coronavirus on Monday. \u201cWe will be setting out the various measures in the way public should be responding, and public bodies should be responding.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t be drawn on the details of what these measures might look like. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go now into the kind of things that might be necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be questions we might need to consider about very big public events.\u201d Johnson also said the government may need to consider closing schools, but expressed that he wanted them to remain open and did not want children to be sent home \u201cunnecessarily\u201d. \u201cCoronavirus is of concern, but we amply have the resources to deal with it. Believe me, we are going to beat this,\u201d he said. The number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to almost 1,700, and the death toll has increased by five to 34, Reuters reports. There were 1,128 cases and 29 death as of last night. This is the largest jump the spread of the virus in one day, Sky News says. Good evening, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the live coverage of coronavirus for the next few hours. If you spot something I miss, do drop me a tweet: @mollyblackall. Boris Johnson has been on a visit to laboratory at the Public Health England National Infection Service in Colindale, north London. Iraq has reported six new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of cases there to 19, Reuters reports citing the health ministry. The ministry said two of the six are in the capital Baghdad and the other four in Sulaimaniya in the north east of the country. All had recently returned from neighbouring Iran, which has had the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside of China, where the outbreak originated. The WHO\u2019s director of pandemic diseases, Sylvie Briand, is endorsing the elbow bump and footshakes as safer alternatives to shaking hands. A patient who has tested positive for coronavirus in Rotterdam, had been staying for a week at another hospital in the Netherlands, the news site Nu.nl reports. The patient had stayed at the Beatrix hospital in nearby Gorchem, for a week without being tested, the site said. The hospital did not respond to comment but said it is closed to visitors and new patients. The reason the Louvre in Paris was forced to close on Sunday (see earlier) was that staff refused to work due to coronavirus fears, AFP reports. Around 300 staff met in the morning and voted \u201calmost unanimously\u201d not to open, Christian Galani of the CGT labour union told AFP, leaving many would-be visitors disappointed.. Louvre management later confirmed the museum was closed for the entire day, and said it would refund ticket-holders. \u201cWe apologise for any inconvenience and will keep you informed as the situation develops,\u201d the museum said on its website. On Saturday, the government announced several measures to try and curb the outbreak in France, including cancelling all gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces. \u201cThe Louvre is a confined space which welcomes more than 5,000 people a day,\u201d said Galani, adding: \u201cthere is real concern on the part of staff.\u201d One of the people who has tested positive for the virus was a resident of Bradford who had travelled to Italy while two others are from Leeds and had travelled to Iran. Dr Simon Padfield, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health England Yorkshire and the Humber, said: \u201cPublic Health England is contacting people who had close contact with three cases of Covid-19 confirmed in West Yorkshire. \u201cOne of the cases is a resident of Bradford who became infected whilst in Italy and the other two cases are residents of Leeds who both became infected whilst in Iran.\u201d And after a case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Essex, Public Health England (PHE) East said \u201cclose contacts\u201d of the patient were being given health advice about symptoms. Dr David Edwards, consultant in health protection, said: \u201cPublic Health England is contacting people who had close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19 who is an Essex resident. The Czech Republic has confirmed its first three cases of coronavirus, Health Minister Adam Vojtech said on Sunday. Health officials said at a news conference the three patients showed mild symptoms and had travelled from places in northern Italy. China has confirmed two new cases on Covid-19 from people who had travelled to Iran. All of a sudden, things have rather changed. If the ongoing floods have seemed to leave too many people at the top untroubled, the decisive arrival in the UK of the coronavirus has highlighted two things that were in danger of being forgotten: the most basic responsibilities of any government, and the necessity of seriousness. As cases increase, anxiety mounts and both the human and economic consequences of the virus\u2019s spread start to become clear, the smirk attached to the face of this government will need to go. Preventing a Covid-19 epidemic in the UK is looking increasingly unlikely, according to Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia. Today\u2019s sharp increase in confirmed cases in the UK shows the country is entering the \u201cnext stage of the epidemic\u201d he said. In remarks distributed by the Science Media Centre, Prof Hunter added: \u201cThe recent sharp increase in the number of reported cases in the UK is a reminder, if any were needed, that we are moving into the next stage of the epidemic. The recent sharp increases in the number of new cases in Italy and then France, Spain and Germany confirm that COVID-19 is spreading in Europe. As yet the number of cases in the UK who have no relevant travel history remains small but even a couple of such cases indicates community spread here. The current containment strategy is still appropriate for now but we can expect to see further increases in the next few days and consequently the UK\u2019s response will move more towards the next phase of delaying rather than containing infections. Although it may still be possible to prevent a community wide epidemic this is looking increasingly unlikely and we should be prepared to cope with a more widespread epidemic on our shores.\u201d Swansea council says its schools will open as normal on Monday despite a confirmd case of covid-10 case in the city - the first in Wales. In a statement it the risk of catching the virus remains low and \u201cno extra measures\u201d need to be taken beyond those set out by Public Health Wales. Here\u2019s the latest summary: Twelve more people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, including the second case of someone who caught the virus within the country. The case will fuel concerns that the virus is circulating undetected. Health authorities are trying to trace people who had come into contact with a 35-year man from Shenzhen who had been working in Bristol and tested positive for coronavirus. He took a Cathay Pacific flight from London Heathrow to Hong Kong on Thursday. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said it may be necessary to follow China\u2019s example by shutting down cities to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He also confirmed plans to bring doctors and nurses out of retirement if the outbreak escalates in the UK. Iran has said its death toll from coronavirus has reached 54 and the number of infected cases is 978. It comes just days after the ministry categorically denied reports 50 people had died from the disease. A top Italian health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on the hospital system as confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy rose to 1,128. The number killed by the virus in Italy has increased to 29. The authorities in France have announced the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 100, with two deaths. The country has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people. The Louvre in Paris was closed on Sunday afternoon as staff held a meeting about the virus. The number of confirmed cases in Spain has increased to 73. A fifth person has tested positive for the virus at the hotel in Tenerife that has been locked down after four other people staying there were diagnosed with coronavirus. Donald Trump has said all travellers from at risk areas will be screened for coronavirus after they arrive in the US. The US, Thailand and Australia have all both reported their country\u2019s first deaths from the virus. Japan reported its second death on Sunday \u2013 a man in his 70s on the island of Hokkaido. Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). Italy\u2019s Serie A football season runs the risk of not finishing if more matches are postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak, Inter Milan\u2019s chief executive Giuseppe Marotta said on Sunday. Reuters reports: Inter\u2019s match at Juventus, which was to have been played later on Sunday, was one of five which were postponed by the league. The games, all in regions where sporting events have been banned by the government, had been due to be played behind closed doors. Italy has registered more than 1,100 confirmed cases and at least 29 deaths. Inter\u2019s match at home to Sampdoria was one of four which were postponed last Sunday and Marotta said a crowded fixture list meant they were running out of dates to reschedule the games. Serie A called an emergency meeting for Wednesday to discuss the consequences of the government measures and the rescheduling of matches. \u201cIf more matches are called off then, yes, we run that risk,\u201d Marotta told Gazzetta dello Sport when asked if the championship might not finish. Serving and former NHS doctors have reacted with scepticism to the idea of bringing former health professionals out of retirement as part of government plans to combat the spread of coronavirus. PA Media has further details about some of the 12 new cases in the UK. Six of the people involved had recently travelled from Italy, while two had been in Iran. These patients are from London, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire. One of the confirmed cases is in Bury, according to Bury council, which said the patient had been taken to a specialist NHS infection centre. The news comes after the health secretary conceded it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the deadly virus would continue to spread across the UK. A pub in Haslemere, Surrey, has been closed until further notice for deep cleaning after a customer \u201ctested positive for coronavirus\u201d. A patient in the county was confirmed as the first to catch the illness within the UK on Friday. The landlords of the Prince of Wales pub said on Facebook that they had no symptoms of the virus and that it was a \u201cprecautionary measure only\u201d. On Sunday, the Department of Health and Social Care announced every department would have a ministerial lead on the virus, and a cross-Whitehall \u201cwar room\u201d is being set up to roll out an enhanced public information campaign. Government lawyers are assessing the possibility of delaying the local authority, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections in May if the coronavirus outbreak continues to escalate, the Guardian can disclose. An email sent to board members of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners on Saturday by its chief executive, Susannah Hancock, reveals that measures to contain the spread of the disease would also include potentially delaying the forthcoming elections. She said that the Home Office, in discussions with the Cabinet Office, had sought legal advice on postponing the elections. South Korea has reported four more coronavirus deaths in the south-eastern city of Daegu, bringing the country\u2019s death toll to 21, the Yonap news agency reports. South Korea has 3,736 confirmed cases of the disease. A widely visited church in Rome has closed over coronavirus fears. The move to shut Rome\u2019s Church of San Luigi dei Francesi, which hosts Caravaggio\u2019s The Calling of St Matthew masterpiece, came after a priest in Paris tested positive for the virus after returning from Italy. Chuang Shuk-kwan, the director of the infectious disease division of the centre for health protection, confirmed the details of the new positive case in a man in Shenzhen who had travelled from London and worked in Bristol. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Chuang said the passenger had been in the business class of flight CX250. The ferry the patient had taken, 3A109, had about 70 passengers, most of whom were Chinese nationals. Chuang advised all passengers on that flight or ferry to call the centre\u2019s hotline and to be \u201caware of the health situation\u201d, and seek medical help or quarantine if necessary. Cathay Pacific is helping authorities trace all passengers who flew from London to Hong Kong, after a passenger on one of its flights, who had been working in Bristol, tested positive. In a statement, it said: Cathay Pacific received notification from the health authorities in Hong Kong regarding a passenger who was recently confirmed to have contracted severe respiratory disease with Novel Infectious Agent. We were informed that the passenger had flown from London to Hong Kong via CX250 on 27 February and arrived Hong Kong on 28 February. We are following the health authorities\u2019 prescribed procedures in conducting disinfection of the aircraft and informing the operating crew and employees, as well as assisting the authorities\u2019 efforts in tracing people who were in close contact with the concerned passenger. We will continue to work closely with the authorities on the case. The man who tested positive for coronavirus in Shenzhen after flying from London last Thursday had been working in Bristol, the Chinese authorities have confirmed. A statement from the Guangdong Health Commission late on Sunday said authorities in Shenzhen had reported an \u201cimported case\u201d of the coronavirus infection, in a 35 year old male from Shenzhen who had been working in Bristol. According to the statement, the patient had travelled to Hong Kong from London on 28 February, on flight CX250 on Cathay Pacific. He landed in Hong Kong at 13:27 and at 15:30 took the ferry 3A109 to Shekou port in Shenzhen arriving at 16:32. His temperature was normal at the time of his arrival. At 16:45 he left from Shekou port and took a taxi to his home in Futian, a district of Shenzhen. \u201cThe patient wore a face mask the entire time,\u201d the statement said. On 29 February around 7am, the patient suffered from symptoms including a cough and fever. Around 10am he was driven to the hospital by family. That evening he tested positive for the virus and around 11pm he was transferred to Shenzhen no 3 hospital for treatment and quarantine. The statement said that at the moment the patient\u2019s condition was \u201cstable.\u201d The statement said that the patient had no history of travel to Hubei and that two of his colleagues in the UK had shown symptoms of cough and fever. Health authorities said that 93 close contacts of the patient had been identified. While 35 people have now tested positive for the virus in the UK, 11,715 have tested negative. One of the 12 people who have tested positive for the virus contracted it from within the UK, according to the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty. In a statement, he said: \u201cOne patient, resident in Essex, had no relevant travel and it is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad; investigations are ongoing.\u201d On Friday, a man from Surrey became the first to test positive to test positive for Covid-19 without having recently been abroad. In his statement, Prof Whitty added: Three patients were close contacts of a known case, transmitted in the UK, identified as part of contact tracing. The patients who have recently travelled are from London, West Yorkshire, Great Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire. All are being investigated and contract tracing has begun. The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 33. Following previously reported confirmed cases in Northern Ireland and Wales, the total number of UK cases is 35. The number of confirmed cases in the UK has leaped by 12 to 35. Read the full report here: The Louvre museum in Paris shut on Sunday afternoon, leaving visitors queueing up outside in the rain as staff and management held a meeting about coronavirus. A spokesperson for the museum said it was expected to open after the meeting, held with the staff doctor. Museums are not covered by government instructions for venues or events with more than 5,000 in a confined space to close until further notice. Donald Trump says all travellers from at risk areas will be screened for coronavirus after they arrive in the US. David and Sally Abel, the British passengers who caught coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off Yokohama, are still being treated in an isolation unit in a Japanese hospital. In a video update on Sunday, they said they were recovering well, but Sally said she had tested positive again for the virus, after testing negative last week. David said that by next Friday they will have served four weeks in quarantine. Meanwhile, all crew members from the cruise ship off Japan have now disembarked, the country\u2019s health minister said, AFP reports. The crew began leaving the Diamond Princess on Thursday for quarantine ashore after the last of the passengers had departed. \u201cIncluding the captain, all crew members disembarked,\u201d health minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters late Sunday. Around 130 people \u2013 including the captain and 98 health ministry officials who were working aboard \u2013 tested negative for the virus as they left the vessel, he said. They will spend 14 days at government-designated dormitories before being allowed to leave Japan, while the vessel will be disinfected before sailing again. At least six people who were hospitalised after being taken off the ship have died, including a British male passenger, the health ministry said. On Sunday, a 78-year-old man evacuated from the vessel died at a Perth hospital, becoming Australia\u2019s first fatality from the disease. The quarantine has been heavily criticised after more than 700 people onboard tested positive for the virus. Here\u2019s video of what Hancock said about shutting down cities in the UK. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said it may be necessary to follow China\u2019s example by shutting down cities to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He also confirmed plans to bring doctors and nurses out of retirement if the outbreak escalates in the UK. A man who has tested positive for coronavirus in Shenzhen, China, travelled there after flying into Hong Kong from London. The 35-year-old man had been working in the UK, according to local reports. Iran has said its death toll from coronavirus has reached 54 and the number of infected cases is 978. It comes just days after the ministry categorically denied reports 50 people had died from the disease. A top Italian health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on the hospital system as confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy rose to 1,128. The number killed by the virus in Italy has increased to 29. The authorities in France have announced the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 100, with two deaths. The country has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people. The number of confirmed cases in Spain has increased to 73. A fifth person has tested positive for the virus at the hotel in Tenerife that has been locked down after four other people staying there were diagnosed with coronavirus. Australia, Thailand and the US have all both reported their country\u2019s first deaths from the virus. Japan reported its second death on Sunday \u2013 a man in his 70s on the island of Hokkaido. Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). Labour is calling on Matt Hancock to fully explain the emergency powers the government is planning in response to a coronavirus outbreak in a Commons update on Monday. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cThere are growing concerns about our part-time prime minister\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and serious questions about capacity in our overstretched NHS. \u201cThe health secretary should come to the Commons on Monday to explain fully the emergency powers he is planning to bring in, and to update MPs on the government\u2019s response so that we can properly scrutinise it.\u201d Iran\u2019s health ministry has said the death toll from coronavirus has now reached 54 as the number of infected cases jumped overnight to 978. It comes days after the ministry categorically denied reports that 50 people had died from the disease. AP reports: The ministry\u2019s spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said new cases were confirmed in a number of cities, including Mashhad, which is home to Iran\u2019s most important Shia shrine that attracts pilgrims from across the region. Calls by Iran\u2019s civilian government to clerics to close such shrines to to the public have not been uniformly followed. The shrine in Mashhad is among those that have remained open. The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday and 385 new cases of infections. Health experts have warned that based on the known mortality rate of Covid-19, the number of confirmed cases is likely to be much higher than the Iranian authorities are reporting. A parent and child who attended the minor injuries unit at Sevenoaks hospital in Kent on Saturday afternoon have been advised to self-isolate at home and call NHS 111 in case they require testing for the coronavirus. The parent grew concerned when the child, who had been at school with pupils who recently returned from Italy, developed a mild temperature. As a precautionary measure, Sevenoaks hospital closed the minor injuries unit at 6.30pm on Saturday, about 90 minutes early. Existing patients continued with their treatment as normal. The unit was deep-cleaned overnight, as a further precaution, and opened as usual on Sunday morning. The rest of the hospital was unaffected. The Department of Health and Social Security did not provide further details on whether the child had been tested or was awaiting a test. A \u201csurveillance network\u201d of GP practices in Scotland will test patients with coughs and fevers and submit samples, even if patients have not travelled to an area affected by coronavirus, as part of the Scottish government plans. The measure was described as an \u201cearly warning\u201d system to alert health professionals to the possible spread of the virus. The chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said: \u201cHospitals and GP surgeries will now conduct tests on some patients with coughs, fevers or shortness of breath \u2013 regardless of whether they have travelled to a place where the virus is known to be spreading. \u201cNot everyone with flu will be tested, but this is a sensible step to take as a precautionary measure to give us an early warning of community transmission.\u201d A \u201cdrive through\u201d testing centre for coronavirus has also opened at the Western General hospital, Edinburgh, where patients with appointments can be tested for the virus in their cars. The Scottish government also announced that in the coming days it will jointly publish an updated action plan with the UK government, as well as the welsh and Northern Irish administrations, outlining the steps that will be taken to manage coronavirus if there is a sustained epidemic. A top Italian health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on the hospital system as confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy rose to 1,128. \u201cThe situation is, frankly, an emergency from the point of view of health system organisation,\u201d Massimo Galli, a professor and director of infectious diseases at Milan\u2019s Sacco hospital, told Corriere della Sera on Sunday. \u201cIt is the equivalent of a tsunami for the number of patients with major diseases being hospitalised all together. For example, on Friday, before the new wave of cases arrived in Lombardy, there were 85 beds occupied by patients intubated for Covid-19, that\u2019s a significant share of those available.\u201d Authorities in the Lombardy region, where 552 people are infected, have asked for a hospital to be made available solely for treating coronavirus and to be able to hire retired doctors and nurses to help with the workload. There have been 29 deaths in Italy, the latest eight victims ranging between the ages of 79 and 90. Those who have died so far were suffering other serious health problems. Some 401 people have been hospitalised \u2013 105 of them in intensive care \u2013 and 543 are at home. Fifty people have recovered. Schools in Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, where there are 213 cases, and Veneto, where there 189, will be closed for another week. The virus has spread to 11 out of 20 Italian regions over the past week, wreaking havoc on the country\u2019s already fragile economy. The financial hub of Milan is endeavouring to return to normal, reopening museums and its famous Duomo, but the city was dealt a further blow after American Airlines announced it was suspending flights to Milan following the US State Department raising it travel warning for parts of Italy. Other airlines have also scrapped or reduced flights due to low demand for travel to Italy. On Friday, the government announced financial relief for those living in 11 towns still under lockdown, businesses and the tourism sector while new measures worth \u20ac3.6bn to help the economy withstand the worst outbreak of coronavirus in Europe, and the third worst in the world, will be introduced this week, finance minister Roberto Gualtieri told La Repubblica on Sunday. A man who has tested positive for coronavirus in Shenzhen, travelled there after flying into Hong Kong from London on Thursday, according to local reports. The news site Caixin reported that a 35-year-old man who had been working in the UK flew from London to Hong Kong on 27 February and arrived at noon on 28 February. He then took a ferry to Shekou, near Shenzhen and then drove to Shenzen, it reported. On Saturday he developed symptoms of a cough and fever and went to the hospital where he was confirmed positive for the virus, it said. He is being treated in isolation in a hospital in Shenzhen. According to documents seen by Caixin, health authorities in Shenzhen notified provincial officials in Guangdong as well as health authorities in Hong Kong on Sunday. 1. The public broadcaster RTHK reported that the Centre for Health Protection is appealing to anyone who travelled business class on Cathay Pacific flight CX250 from London to Hong Kong on Friday to get in touch. It said it had received notice from Guangdong authorities that a passenger on that flight was confirmed to have Covid-19. The health authorities in France have announced the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country has jumped to 100 as the government took measures to limit the spread of the virus. Of the reported cases so far, two people have died, 86 are in hospital - nine of whom are in a \u201cserious\u201d condition - and 12 people have recovered. The number of contaminations has leapt in France from 38 on Friday. Three health workers at a Paris hospital have tested positive for the coronavirus, as well as a firefighter in Rennes. In the Haute-Savoie region, where there has been a cluster of cases thought to have originated from a person who had returned from northern Italy , the mayor of La Balme-de-Sillingy, Fran\u00e7ois Daviet announced he had tested positive. France has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people in \u201cconfined spaces\u201d and outside demonstrations in areas where the virus has been reported. Today\u2019s Paris half marathon is cancelled as well as the last day of the Agriculture Salon and the carnival at Annecy. However some sporting events going ahead. Around 2,000 schoolchildren are in self-imposed quarantine at home following advice from health officials to those who visited infected areas during the half term holidays to stay away from classes. Priests in some dioceses, including Paris, have been instructed not to put the \u2018host\u2019 into communicants\u2019 mouths but in their hands. Air France has imposed a freeze on hiring new staff and announced cost-cutting measures last week to offset the economic impact of the virus on the travel industry. People over 6o and those with underlying health conditions should try to avoid \u201ccrowded areas\u201d and \u201cplaces where you might interact with people who are sick\u201d, according to the head of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Spain now has 73 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to the head of the country\u2019s Centre for the Coordination of Health Emergencies and Alerts. Speaking on Sunday morning, Fernando Sim\u00f3n said that 90% of the cases were imported or related to imported cases of the virus, adding that Spain would not be raising its alert level for the time being. Nor, he said, would it be enacting the drastic measures seen in France and Italy. A fifth person has tested positive for the virus at the hotel in Tenerife that has been locked down after four other people staying there were diagnosed with the coronavirus. The Italian national, part of the same group as the four original cases at the island\u2019s H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel, is now in hospital. The Canary Islands\u2019 regional health authorities said the man had been in isolation in a hotel room since 24 February and was \u201cin good state of health\u201d. Meanwhile, it appears that Ecuador\u2019s first case of the virus could have originated in Spain after a 70-year-old Ecuadorian woman living in Spain tested positive for the virus after flying from Madrid to Ecuador\u2019s second city, Guayaquil, on 14 February. According to Ecuadorian health authorities, the woman showed no symptoms of the illness on the flight. The American Physical Society has announced the cancellation of one of the world\u2019s major international scientific conferences, little more than a day before it was due to start. An announcement on its website said: \u201cDue to rapidly escalating health concerns relating to the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the 2020 APS March Meeting in Denver, Colorado, has been canceled. Please do not travel to Denver to attend the March Meeting.\u201d Around 10,000 physicists and scientists from around the world were due to attend the conference this week, and the late cancellation has caught many overseas delegates in the middle of travelling. Isolating UK cities, as the Chinese authorities did to Wuhan where coronavirus was first detected, may be necessary to stop the the spread of the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has conceded. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Hancock also confirmed that the NHS was planning to bring doctors out of retirement if the coronavirus becomes more widespread. Marr asked Hancock: \u201cChina, of course, isolated entire cities. Is it conceivable under any circumstance, you try and cut off the city in this country?\u201d Hancock replied: \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a huge economic and social downside to that. But we don\u2019t take anything off the table at this stage, because you\u2019ve got to make sure that you have all the tools available, if that is what\u2019s necessary. But I want to minimise the social and economic disruption.\u201d He said the government would be publishing its battle plan for the measures it would take under a worst case scenario for the outbreak. He said: \u201cIt may be necessary to close some schools, but right now, people should not be closing schools if there isn\u2019t a positive case.\u201d Hancock confirmed that other \u201cpopulation distancing measures\u201d could include banning public gatherings of more than 5,000 people as the French government has announced. He said: \u201cWe are looking at all those sorts of things, we do not rule them out.\u201d Asked if retired doctors and nurses would be asked to come out of retirement, Hancock said: \u201cWe may do. That isn\u2019t something we need right now. But the big challenge for the NHS in the event of this becoming widespread here is NHS staff themselves not being able to come to work because they\u2019re because they\u2019re ill or they\u2019re self-isolating. So it\u2019s about having the people available.\u201d He also played down a report in the Guardian that England only has 15 available beds for adults to treat the most severe respiratory failure. He said: \u201cI saw those figures published in the Guardian and they are wrong and out of date. We have 50 now, and we can ramp that up to 500. And then if necessary 5,000 beds that are able to cope with the worst impact of this virus but of course. Hancock also confirmed that non-emergency surgery, including hip and knee replacements, may be cancelled. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that. But these have to be clinical decisions. Clinicians have to make decisions about what is the most important and effective use of NHS resources. They do this all the time.\u201d Hancock also denied Labour claims Boris Johnson was shirking his responsibility by delaying chairing a Cobra emergency committee on the outbreak until Monday. He told Sky: The prime minister has been all over this. I have daily calls with him often more than once a day. And I\u2019ve been updating cabinet weekly. I\u2019ve been chairing those Cobra meetings across government \u2013 a case of ministers and officials working incredibly well together. And the prime minister is fully on top of all of this, and and that\u2019s the way it should be. Last week he did a night shift at a hospital to find out what it\u2019s really like on the frontline at two o\u2019clock in the morning. I applaud him for doing that Clearly, I\u2019m leading the operational response and working incredibly closely with him and every other member of the government. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government is considering \u201call options\u201d for tackling the spread of coronavirus. Speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge programme, he described the outbreak as \u201ca very, very significant challenge\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are planning in case this gets much worse\u201d. Hancock insisted ministers would put the safety of people first, but they did not want to unnecessarily hit the economy and society. He said: We\u2019re considering all options. At the moment the number of cases in this country is 23. And that means that so long as people are washing hands and taking the precautions that are set out that is the right thing to do. We don\u2019t rule out taking any of these other measures. We will advice on those measures when it is right to take them because we want to minimise the economic and social disruption subject to keeping people safe. It\u2019s a balancing act, where I place the greatest weight on keeping people safe. But there\u2019s no point in doing things that aren\u2019t clinically effective. We have to be guided by the science. He added: The plan is very clear, firstly, to contain this virus, that\u2019s the stage we\u2019re in now. It means that every single case that is found here gets immediate treatment, but also we contact all of the people that that person has been in close contact with. Largely most of the cases so far, are from people who\u2019ve caught the virus elsewhere and brought it here, and we\u2019re then able to contain it. We\u2019ve put \u00a340m into trying to find a vaccine and also trying to improve the treatments for people who do have the disease. The experts say that a vaccine, even accelerated as fast as possible, is still many months off. But the potential for treatments that make the virus less of a problem if you\u2019ve got it, they are more optimistic. The final plan is to prepare for mitigation should this become endemic in this country and making sure that not only the NHS is prepared, but also all parts of society. The government has got a huge role to play, but so does every single person. At the moment, the best thing people can do is make sure that they wash their hands for 20 seconds or more. We\u2019re telling children that you\u2019ve got to wash your hands whilst you sing happy birthday to make sure that gets through very simply. If we get to a position where this is much more widespread, then of course we\u2019re we we will change the advice to deal with that. There\u2019s a danger to doing things too early because they wouldn\u2019t be effective. We are looking at every single option \u2026 with a clear battle plan for how we rise to the challenge of this. Hancock noted that stopping all flights from China, as pushed by some, had not proved successful for Italy, which is the worst affected country in Europe. Kuwait has confirmed a new case of coronavirus infection, bringing the total number of people diagnosed with the disease in the country to 46, a health ministry official told a press conference on Sunday, Reuters reports. The majority of the cases, including the one identified in the past 24 hours, are either people who had travelled to Iran or been in contact with people who were there, the official said. For the first time, Japan\u2019s professional baseball teams staged pre-season opening games behind closed doors after the country dramatically escalated its response to coronavirus by closing schools and cancelling mass events. The condition of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman detained in Iran, is getting \u201cworse and worse\u201d but the Iranian authorities are still refusing to test her for coronavirus, her family has said. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Richard said his wife\u2019s guards were \u201ckeeping away\u201d from her in case she has caught the disease. He said her \u201ccold like symptoms that have got worse and worse and they\u2019re not going away\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019m sure the prison is not testing partly because there\u2019s not many testing kits and partly because they don\u2019t want to know\u201d. The US, Australia and Thailand have reported their first deaths from coronavirus as two frontline doctors in China died and more countries put in place bans on large gatherings and travel restrictions. A 35-year-old male retail worker in Thailand died from Covid-19, according to the country\u2019s department of disease control on Sunday. The man had also tested positive for dengue fever. In Australia, a 78-year-old man who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in a hospital in western Australia. His wife has also contracted the virus. On Saturday, US officials said a man in his 50s in Washington state had died, after being tested for the disease on Thursday. Authorities said they did not know how he had contracted the virus because he did not have any history of travel to affected areas or contact with known Covid-19 cases. On Sunday, China reported its sharpest increase in new infections in a week with 573 new cases, the highest daily rise in a week. Chinese health authorities reported 35 new deaths on Sunday, a drop from the previous day\u2019s toll of 47. A 32-year old doctor named Zhong Jinxing in the southern province of Guangxi who reportedly died from \u201coverwork\u201d on Friday after working for 33 consecutive days. Another doctor, Jiang Xueqing, 55, died on Sunday after having been infected with Covid-19, according to Chinese state media. Good morning from London, where the main news is that former health professionals could be brought out of retirement under emergency plans to combat the spread of coronavirus. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is expected to give more details about the plans in a round of Sunday morning broadcast interviews. It comes after a further three people in England tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 23. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy, while the other had returned from Asia, according to the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Thailand has reported its first death from the virus - a 35-year-old retail worker who was also diagnosed with dengue fever. Japan reported its second death on Sunday - a man in his 70s on the island of Hokkaido. Australia recorded its first Covid-19 death on Sunday \u2013 a 78-year-old man who had been a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. He died in Perth and his wife is infected with the virus. The US has recorded its first death from Covid-19. A man in his 50s in Washington state, who had underlying health issues but with no travel history to affected areas. Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered).

All cases are linked to recent travel to Italy. The woman, from northern Coahuila, was not showing symptoms. She had recently traveled to Milan. An alarming story from our Beijing correspondent, Lily Kuo, on citizen journalist Li Zehua who is missing, presumed detained. He\u2019s one of many for whom the coronavirus crisis has led to a political awakening and a demand for free speech. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remain silent, or shut my eyes and ears. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t have a nice life, with a wife and kids. I can. I\u2019m doing this because I hope more young people can, like me, stand up,\u201d he says. The live stream, posted on Weibo, where it was later deleted, and on YouTube, shows two men in plain clothes entering the apartment and then cuts out. An interesting report from Reuters, about Indonesia, which continues to say it has seen no cases, despite some infections around the world linked to travel to or through Bali: Indonesia has the resources to cope with a coronavirus outbreak, the director of its leading infectious diseases hospital said, defending detection procedures in the Southeast Asian nation of more than 260 million, where no cases have been reported. The world\u2019s fourth most populous nation has tested 141 suspected cases, a small figure for its population, sparking concern among some medical professionals of a lack of vigilance and a risk of undetected cases. Neighbouring Malaysia has reportedly run about 1,000 tests, and Britain more than 10,000. \u201cWe can\u2019t doubt our skills and the facts we gather,\u201d said Muhammad Syahril, director of the Sulianti Saroso hospital in Jakarta, the capital, when asked why Indonesia had detected no cases. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have cases, we don\u2019t have cases,\u201d he said in an interview at the hospital on Friday. \u201cWhy would we cover it up?\u201d Reuters: A man in his 70s died on Japan\u2019s northernmost island of Hokkaido on Saturday night after testing positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, local authorities said on Sunday. The municipal government of Hokkaido said the patient was hospitalised on Jan. 17 for another disease, but started to show flu-like symptoms a few weeks later and tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb. 25. Public broadcaster NHK and other local media said authorities suspect the man may have caught the virus while in hospital. The man\u2019s death marks the sixth fatality from Covid-19 in Japan, excluding six deaths among those aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess. The coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong has not reached its peak yet, he Dean of the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Faculty of Medicine, Professor Gabriel Leung, warned on Sunday. RTHK reports Leung said it was too soon to tell when the outbreak would be end, and people should remain vigilant. \u201cThe rest of the world actually views Hong Kong, along with Singapore, as the gold standard in epidemic control,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at these two places, we have very similar absolute numbers of confirmed cases, yet we have a population that is one third bigger then Singapore, so - on a per capita basis - we\u2019re not doing too badly.\u201d Hong Kong has reported 95 cases and two deaths. Samsung Electronics has closed one of its factories in South Korea, according to Yonhap news agency. The mobile device factory in Gumni, near Davey, was closed after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus. It has been closed for a short time last month after an earlier case was discovered. From Reuters: Churches were closed in South Korea on Sunday with many holding online services instead, as authorities fought to rein in public gatherings, with 376 new coronavirus infections taking the tally to 3,526 cases. That came a day after the biggest daily jump of 813 cases in South Korea\u2019s battle with the largest virus outbreak outside China, said the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), which will update numbers later in the day. The death toll of 17 was unchanged from Saturday, it added. In Seoul, the capital, about a dozen worshippers were turned away from the Yoido Full Gospel Church, which put a sermon for its 560,000 followers on YouTube, filmed with a small choir instead of all 200 members and 60-strong orchestra. \u201cI had heard there would be no service, but just came to check as I live nearby, but yes, it is so empty,\u201d said one of them, Song Young-koo, as he left South Korea\u2019s biggest church. \u201cIt\u2019s a wise decision to do it online, since the virus would easily spread at mass gatherings and churches can be no exception.\u201d Some more details on that death in Thailand. Dr. Teerawat Hemachutha, Thiravat Hemachudha, Head of Emerging Disease Health Science Center Faculty of Medicine Chulalongkorn Hospital, the Thai Red Cross, posted on Facebook earlier today that the victim was a 35-year-old male retail worker who also tested positive to dengue fever. Citing an unnamed health official, Reuters is reporting that Thailand has seen its first Covid-19 death. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague, Helen Davidson, shortly, but before that, here\u2019s a summary of the top points so far. Australia recorded its first Covid-19 death on Sunday \u2013 a 78-year-old man who had been a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. He died in Perth and his wife is infected with the virus. The US also recorded its first death, a man in his 50s from Seattle who had underlying medical issues. Washington state\u2019s governor declared a state of emergency. The man had no history of travel to affected areas or contact with a known COVID-19 case Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). South Korea has recorded 376 more Covid-19 cases, taking the country\u2019s total to 3,526. Seventeen people have died. WHO has raised the global risk level to \u201cvery high\u201d over coronavirus. Thailand reports 42nd case of Covid-19. Armenia has reported its first case of Covid-19. Thailand now has 42 cases of Covid-19, after a 21-year-old man tested positive on Saturday, the Bangkok Post reports. Sukhum Kanchanaphimai, the permanent secretary for public health, said the man\u2019s job brought him into contact with foreign tourists and he fell ill on 24 February, before seeking treatment the following day. He\u2019s currently in hospital in Bangkok. The country has not reported any deaths from the virus but, as of Sunday, authorities will have greater powers to act after the Public Health Ministry designated Covid-19 a dangerous communicable disease. Tourism in many parts of Thailand has suffered, with travellers curtailing their journeys amid fears of the virus\u2019s spread. American Airlines will suspend all US flights to Milan. It announced the move just hours after the US State Department said it was raising its travel warning for parts of Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak to Level 4 or \u201cdo not travel\u201d. This covers travel to Lombardy and Veneto, in Italy\u2019s north. American said it will suspend flights to and from Milan, from New York-JFK and Miami until 24 April, citing a reduction in demand. Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the US response to the virus, said on Saturday that the State Department will work with Italy to coordinate medical screening of any individuals coming to the United States. Chinese state media is reporting that a doctor \u2013 32-year-old Zhong Jinxing \u2013 has died \u201cfrom overwork\u201d. The People\u2019s Daily repots that another doctor, Jiang Xueqing, 55, also died on Sunday. I\u2019m just doubling back on those Chinese figures announced today, that I mentioned at the start of the blog. Another 35 deaths were reported on Sunday, and 573 new confirmed cases. Of the deaths, all but one were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. All but three of the new confirmed cases were also in Hubei. The total confirmed cases in China is 79,824, of which 41,825 (or 52%) are listed as recovered, and a total of 2,870 deaths have been recorded. Based on those figures, the case fatality rate for Covid-19 is 3.6%, which is something Chinese state media is also reporting. However, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that there is a direct link between deaths and the number of cases reported in calculating that rate, so if people are having mild symptoms and don\u2019t go through the testing process, there\u2019s a likelihood that the eventual rate case fatality rate will be lower. We will only know this in hindsight. You may have seen reports last week that a dog in Hong Kong had tested \u201cweak positive\u201d to Covid-19. Experts in the UK told the Guardian they thought it was unlikely to be an actual infection, and that one possible explanation was that a dog had produced a false positive test as a result of close contact with a human who had the virus, or from coming in contact with the virus via touch. The dog showed no relevant symptoms of the virus authorities said and Hong Kong health authorities advised that it had no evidence that pets can be infected with Covid-19 or a source of the infection. But a spokesman from the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), said: \u201cTo ensure public and animal health, the department strongly advise mammalian pets of patients confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 virus to be put under quarantine by the AFCD.\u201d The WHO says it is working with its partner agencies for human/animal health and is \u201cwaiting for further tests from Hong Kong\u201d, but the WHO boss, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said past experience with coronavirus and \u201cour current understanding of Covid-19 does not indicated that common household pets spread the disease or make people sick\u201d. If you\u2019re just catching up with the latest news on the virus, outbreak, a reminder that the World Health Organization has raised the risk assessment \u201cvery high\u201d globally. It also said the risk within #China remains unchanged as \u201cvery high.\u201d The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the risk level had been elevated for two reasons difficulty in identifying cases due to non-specific symptoms &amp; the potential of undetected transmission potential for major impact on healthcare systems in some affected &amp; potentially affected countries. The WHO also released virus advice on the social media app, TikTok, in an effort it said to beat the \u201cinfodemic\u201d. South Korea has recorded 376 more Covid-19 cases, taking the country\u2019s total to 3,526. Seventeen people have died. Of the 376 new cases, 333 were in Daegu, 300km southeast of Seoul, which has been at the centre of the outbreak linked to the. Shincheonji Church of Jesus. The Yonhap agency says there were also 26 new cases reported in neighbouring North Gyeongsang Province. As of Sunday morning, South Korea was carrying out tests on 32,422 people nationwide, while 61,037 people have tested negative in total. Still on Australia, and on Sunday, the country\u2019s Home Affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said it was not possible to extend travel bans to all countries affected by the coronavirus outbreak, but he defended Australia\u2019s decision to restrict entry to people who had travelled from Iran, but not South Korea, which has many more cases. \u201cIf you look at the underreporting or the lack of reporting coming out of Iran ... there was a real concern as to whether they had a handle on the numbers,\u201d Dutton said, adding that South Korea has a more advanced health system. We are hearing a news conference from Australia, where officials have confirmed that a Western Australian man has confirmed the country\u2019s first death from Covid-19. Dr Andrew Robertson, Western Australia\u2019s chief health officer, confirms that the man travelled back to Australia from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The man was diagnosed in the Howard Springs quarantine facility outside Darwin 9 or 10 days ago. The man, in his late 70s, passed away in the early hours of Sunday morning in intensive care in a West Australian hospital. His wife is also infected with Covid-19. Robertson who is giving the news conference, has confirmed that there is still no community transmission in Australia. The man\u2019s wife is in isolation in hospital and being monitored. Robertson is asked what Australians can do to protect themselves from the virus. He says handwashing is important but also says people should consider getting the flu shot this year. We are getting unconfirmed reports that an Australian man has died in Western Australia from Covid-19 \u2013 the country\u2019s first fatality. We are waiting for official confirmation, but media reports say he is a 78-year-old passenger from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, and was one of the 164 Australians to be repatriated from the ship around two weeks ago. We will bring you confirmation on this as soon as we have it \u2013 we are expecting a news conference shortly. First to the US where the first death from Covid-19 has been recorded. The man was in his 50s and had underlying health issues. He died at a hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle. Officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus. Washington state has two other presumed cases at a long-term care facility in Kirkland where more than 50 residents and staff could be showing symptoms, according to Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington health department\u2019s communicable disease unit. \u201cAt this point we do not have widespread community-wide transmission locally. We have transmission that\u2019s associated with an outbreak at this long-term care facility,\u201d Duchin said. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.
