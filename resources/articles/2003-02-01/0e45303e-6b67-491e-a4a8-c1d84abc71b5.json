Nominations for his successor as deputy leader closed this eveninig and the party's 53 MPs will vote over the next week, with the winner to be announced on February 12. The party's foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, and its former Treasury spokesman, Malcolm Bruce, are to stand for the post. Simon Hughes, the party's home affairs spokesman, ruled himself out of a contest when he announced he wished to run for the mayor of London last month. Mr Beith - who has been deputy leader since 1992 and was deputy leader of the Liberal party in the eighties - said today it was \"an important job\". \"Most leaders operate best if they don't feel they have a rival as a deputy,\" he said of his time in the job. \"A deputy must compliment the work of the leader - their primary purpose should be not to be noticed but to make sure the party itself is more effective.\" The new select committee will scrutinise the government's handling of the legal system and constitutional issues. On his new role he added, \"I am delighted to have the opportunity to lead a new committee to examine areas of government activity which are so important to the lives of my constituents, especially in the legal system and the way the law courts are administered\". \"The lord chancellor also has major constitutional responsibilities, including responsibility for the election system and for referendums and the committee will look forward to questioning him and his officials on many matters,\" he added. Mr Bruce said \"20 years in parliament have given me a breadth of experience ideal for the job\". \"If elected I would like to use my position to support the leader in his campaigning in the country and ensure that Liberal Democrat MPs' views are taken into account in strategy and policy development.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
