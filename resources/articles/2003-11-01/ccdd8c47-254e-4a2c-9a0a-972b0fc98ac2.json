The attack followed local government minister Nick Raynsford's announcement earlier today that district shire councils will receive a below-inflation increase as part of next year's local government finance settlement. While the average increase for councils across the country was set at 4.7%, district shire councils earned themselves only 2.5%, with a \"floor\" - below which no council will fall - of 2.2%. This contrasts with the average 5.1% for councils with education and social services responsibilities, the government's explicit policy priorities. This low figure is likely to put extreme pressure on shire districts to raise council taxes once more next year, to ensure they deliver on their responsibilities which, include road maintenance and refuse collection. Such a move will play badly with the government, which has based its settlement on an \"assumed\" council tax increase for next year of 3.9% and has repeatedly warned that council tax increases viewed as \"unreasonable\" will be capped. The LGA also fears that councils with education and social services will continue to be funded in full at the expense of other services. It claims that 13 authorities with education and social services responsibilities will see their entire grant increase 'passported' in full to schools, leaving other services penniless. Another 18 authorities will have practically no room for manoeuvre once they have delivered education secretary Charles Clarke's pupil guarantee to schools, it claims, leaving the council-tax payer and recipients of non-school services, including social services to pick up the pieces. The LGA chairman, Sir Jeremy Beecham, said: \"While we have won financial concessions on behalf of local government today - over half the sum we warned about has been delivered - many councils have a serious shortfall to bridge in planning the budgets and council tax for the coming year.\" And the LGA deputy chairman, Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, added: \"The district grants are not at all good, but they obviously do not have education and social services. It is going to leave many with a real problem.\" Tony Travers, director of the London School of Economics' Greater London group, criticised the settlement, which he said was based on purely \"political\" motives. \"The shire districts, but also the same services within the bigger authorities will get squeezed,\" he said. \"Your school may get 4-5% next year but the roads you use to get there, whether by foot or by car, are likely to have more potholes and the pavements will be less well maintained. It is the physical impact on neighbourhoods.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
