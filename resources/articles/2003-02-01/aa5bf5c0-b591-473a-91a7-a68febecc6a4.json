In the 40,000 graves lie \"the good\" and \"the bad\", including victims of the El Paso shootout (four men in five minutes), a companion of Billy the Kid, Chinese railroad builders, the improbably named Diamond Dick and a group of old slodiers (sic). Reaching Concordia cemetery involves navigating a twisting highway interchange, aptly dubbed the \"spaghetti bowl\" by locals, and then finding the unassuming entrance. In the same way that El Paso, built in the middle of hundreds of miles of Texan desert and hugging the Mexican border, has evolved into a straggling city, its historic cemetery has also been engulfed by urban sprawl. Although not the most obvious tourist attraction, it's well worth tracking down. Since the arrival of the Spaniards in 1581 this region has seen the westward expedition of pioneer America, the coming of the railroads to the western frontier, Indian wars and Indian peace and the birth of the US cavalry. The diverse, and often bloody, history is charted in Concordia, divided into Jewish, Masonic, Catholic, Chinese and military sections, along with the rather undistinguished looking \"Boot Hill\" section, final resting place of desperadoes who died with their boots on. Next to elaborate memorials, small white crosses mark the graves of the Buffalo Soldiers, the first black Americans to serve in the US army and revered for their bravery. It is believed their name came from Indians, who compared their hair to that of the buffalo and considered them courageous and worthy adversaries. Hardin's grave is not sign posted; to find it you need to look near the west entrance to the Chinese section. The simple headstone for the outlaw turned lawman briefly records his life from 1853 to 1895. Killing more men than Billy the Kid and Jesse James combined - he had shot 44 men in gun duels by the time he was sentenced to 25 years in prison at the age of 25 - Hardin was known as the fastest gun in the west and met his own death after being shot from behind in an unprovoked attack. Some superstitious visitors leave poker hands and Colt 45 cartridges at his graveside. Legends of the famous, and infamous, live on and we followed Hardin's footsteps in downtown El Paso, where elegant old buildings, with distinctive Spanish and Moorish architecture, rub shoulders with their bland, modern counterparts. Camera-toting tourists have replaced the gunslingers of yesteryear and there is comforting irony in the fact that El Paso, the fifth largest city in Texas with a population of 700,000, is officially recognised as the Lone Star state's safest town. But don't despair - if you're searching for the cowboy dream, it's still alive and kicking. In wide, quiet shopping streets glittering silver buckles, ornate bootlace ties, Stetsons, fancy shirts and omnipresent rows of boots in shining leather and snakeskin vie to catch the eye. The cowboy boot-making capital of the world, it's said there are many who only own boots and never wear an ordinary pair of shoes. This theory is upheld by the number of booted-and-suited individuals who passed me by, all with the swagger that seems to be an intrinsic part of the footwear. Cowboys expect to get three years' wear from their boots so be prepared to pay $300 plus if you want a good pair, particularly the Lucchese brand worn by early celebrities such as John Wayne and Gene Autry and present-day stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sandra Bullock. That evening we went to Cattleman's Steakhouse, 20 miles east of El Paso at Indian Cliffs Ranch. In the decades following the Civil War more than six million cattle were herded out of Texas and the state continues to lead the nation in cattle production. Home to more head of livestock than Texans, the steakhouse is testimony to longhorn legacy. For $26.95 you get The Cowboy, a 2lb T-bone steak served with potato, beans and coleslaw. The less hungry can opt for The Cowgirl, weighing in at 1\u00bdlb, or seek culinary refuge with a 10oz burger from the menu's \"small appetite\" section. The following day we made the half-day trip to the Prude Ranch, Fort Davis, which recently launched weeklong cowboy schools, providing guests with the opportunity to work alongside wranglers. Although aimed at those who want to \"be\" a cowboy rather than \"play\" cowboys, the ranch caters for all standards of riders, including total beginners who are aided by the armchair-like qualities of western saddles. We couldn't have made up the names of our instructors had we tried - horse trader Apache Adams, famous for once roping a mountain lion, former sheriff Wid McCutcheon and retired lawman George Grubb. They spoke in gravely drawls, making even the most mundane conversation sound like a voiceover from the movies. After eating a buffet dinner from tin plates we walked back to our snug wood cabins by torchlight, picking out a couple of deer as they ran across our path. Next morning Apache ran through caring for that cowboy essential, the four-legged friend, before we saddled up and headed out across spectacular wide open spaces in an area that lives up to its description as the last unspoilt frontier. Being home on the range doesn't necessarily mean roughing it and our second ranch, Cibolo Creek, manages to combine modern-day luxury, excellently run facilities and the irresistibly romantic attraction of the old west. Set in 25,000 totally secluded acres at Shafter, this ranch was the inspiration for the old TV western series Rawhide. Professional wranglers and rodeo riders Juan and Bobby, Stetsons hermetically sealed to their heads, patiently showed us the fundamentals of roping. The greenhorns who succeeded with the wooden cow were promoted to practising with something on the hoof, one managing to neatly lasso a young steer's back legs as the herd galloped past. Then it was time to ride out on the responsive quarter horses, a world away from the nose-to-tail plodders found on some dude ranches. We returned at dusk, the homeward journey punctuated by one of Juan's many lyrical yarns. Texans have turned storytelling into an art form and it took several days before we realised some tales are as tall as ten gallon hats. But despite generous Texas portions of individual embellishment many have evolved from a grain of truth, with storytelling roots going back to times of passing on oral history and providing entertainment in pre-radio and television days. Texas is larger than life and \"small\" and \"modest\" are not part of the vocabulary. Bigger than any European country - the UK would fit into it twice over -it covers 267,300 square miles and straddles two time zones. Strike up a conversation and good-natured hyperbole will come thick and fast. You name it, Texas has the biggest, best or the most. In Giant, the classic James Dean film, Elizabeth Taylor's character stares out of the window during a long railroad trip and asks: \"Tell me when we're in Texas\". Her husband, played by Rock Hudson, replies: \"Honey, you've been looking at it for the last eight hours.\" Yup, Texas sure is the big country.
