Last year City finished behind only the champions, Chelsea, though the 38 goals conceded were the poorest of the top four clubs. And while Fernandinho has no concerns about the City attack \u2013 they were the leading scorers last season with 83 goals \u2013 he knows the team have to tighten up and the defence and midfield must work better as a unit. \u201cThe biggest thing to improve is defensively. The attacking part of the team is very strong and it\u2019s about improving consistency in defence, particularly in away games,\u201d said the Brazilian midfielder. \u201cOf course, that includes myself as part of my role. But I believe we have learned the lesson and I\u2019m confident the new season will be much better.\u201d Fernandinho is clear that City can challenge for the title and the Champions League, the club having never gone beyond the last 16 of Europe\u2019s elite competition. \u201cI believe the squad is strong enough to fight for both trophies and I feel very enthusiastic about our chances this season, especially in the Champions League,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to be my third season in the competition and [winning it] is something that motivates me. \u201cPersonally I believe the team can be very successful scoring goals but it also depends on the profile of the different players, some who can score, some who will provide assists, so let\u2019s see.\u201d City start at West Bromwich Albion on Monday evening before welcoming Chelsea to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Fernandinho wants maximum points from both games. \u201cIt is a tough start against tough teams, especially the Chelsea game, but we have worked very hard during the week and our objective is to start with six points to start the Premier League in a good way,\u201d he said. Manuel Pellegrini has added Enes Unal, Fabian Delph, Patrick Roberts and Raheem Sterling this summer. Sterling\u2019s departure from Liverpool may have been controversial but Fernandinho has no doubts the 20-year-old will be able to deal with any hostile reaction from opposition fans. \u201cYes, I think he is a strong character with the right personality. I remember seeing him in an interview talking about his determination to win trophies and I\u2019m sure he will be able to manage the situation,\u201d the 30-year-old said. Sterling will hope to form a menacing new attacking trio with Sergio Ag\u00fcero and David Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s to be seen on the pitch. It is not just talking about it but it is about what happens on the pitch,\u201d said Fernandinho. \u201cThe players that have come in are very good. But there is also a responsibility of the players already here to help them properly integrate into the team and allow them to give their best.\u201d Delph\u2019s arrival means Fernandinho will face competition for a starting berth. \u201cI know him well because I have faced him many times in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cI welcome the addition of good players because there will be a need to rotate with the large number of games we will play this season.\u201d Fernandinho formerly played for Shakhtar Donetsk and the midfielder is saddened by the war in eastern Ukraine. \u201cI speak to my former team-mates on a weekly basis and I feel sorry about the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see people losing their lives and sad to see the team having to move from one city to the other [they play their home games in Lviv, 750 miles from their Donetsk home]. But they are very mature and professional players and they are strong enough to cope with what is a challenging situation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
