Five heavenly bodies in your skies puts you in a commanding (indeed, magnetic) position - in personal matters, that means you can drop some defences and let the world in on the secret passions that drive you. Professionally, you're playing patience; follow due process and you'll ring the bell. Sagittarius 22 Nov-21 Dec It's about making the enterprise named 'work' work for you, rather than being beholden to agendas handed down from on high (often unavoidable) or, worse, low (downright unacceptable). Making yourself a rare commodity might, paradoxically, raise your stock - you will be in major demand just two weeks down the line. Meanwhile, serve the system diligently, but, mainly, serve yourself. Capricorn 22 Dec-19 Jan Even the most broad-shouldered Capricorn can't shoulder every burden single-handed. Today's full Moon tells the same story on a personal level: to gain love you have sometimes to make yourself vulnerable. If you're single, there is no better time to be out in the fray. Aquarius 20 Jan-19 Feb Reaching a rapprochement with the powers-that-be remains the challenge, and if that means being pushed out of your comfort zone to gain a more involved or independent life, so be it. Working for less than your usual rates, for example, doesn't have to be for ever. Personal relationships? On hold until your working life is sorted. Pisces 20 Feb-20 Mar Don't confuse a glitch in your plans with a wholesale collapse. A few renegotiations may be inevitable, but with Jupiter dominating your 'scope this month, optimism and good faith are in order. Commerce and education are well starred - ditto romance, despite the trials of long-distance love. Keep communications open. Aries 21 Mar-19 Apr Fancy becoming a Scorpio for a while? As your Mars is in said sign, your personal power comes from a Scorpionic approach - not the cloak-and-dagger stuff, but by being emotional and profound. For now, nothing happens in a hurry. Taurus 20 Apr-20 May As today's full Moon is in Taurus's skies, the fireworks may not be confined to Guy Fawkes celebrations. Whether it's a blazing row with your can't-live-without or discovering you have more dates than you can handle, what's under emphasis is your reliance on other people. And vice versa of course, but it's you who has to concede most ground. Hrrmph! Gemini 21 May-20 Jun Work is definitely area in your 'scope that promises most advancement now, but while you're chained to your desk/toiling on the production line and bringing past efforts up to date (this is an overhaul few weeks), Neptune promises to reveal a few escape routes. Overseas connections are especially important. And if you're in the art/creativity racket, here's deep inspiration. Cancer 21 Jun-22 Jul Cancer being a water sign and your horoscope being full of the stuff, expect and endure/celebrate exceptionally emotional scenarios. These are planets to help move a friendship into romantic mode, freshen up the marriage or loosen the ties of an exhausted relationship. The next fortnight is about bringing financial deals to fruition, especially any from the millennium. Leo 23 Jul-22 Aug If your efforts over the past 12 months to carve out your own role in the world haven't worked out, rest assured that now is not the time to throw in the towel. Au contraire, when you are weariest is the time when you must plod doggedly on - unless, of course, you have lost your old Leo hunger for public recognition. But that seems unlikely. Virgo 23 Aug-22 Sep Mars and Venus smiling on Virgo favour any situation where you can exert your charm: business meetings, lonely-hearts encounters, idle chat. The personal touch counts double since, with Mercury crossing the Sun, information is unreliable. An overseas connection has a vital role to play, however. Libra 23 Sep-23 Oct Love's young dream - a subject close to every Libran heart, even at a more advanced age - gets a reality check this week. The question is whether your feelings are reciprocated, and if an existing relationship can pay its way. Mercifully, you won't have to wait long for answers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
