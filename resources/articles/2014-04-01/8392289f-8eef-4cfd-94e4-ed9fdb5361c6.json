In 1977, aged 30, he founded his own dance company, and since then has created more than 40 dance works in his own singular style. Depending on your point of view these are either creations of smouldering psychological intensity, offering an emotional roller-coaster ride through great works of literature such as The Seagull, Anna Karenina and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin (and leaving out the boring bits), or lurid and artistically questionable exercises unworthy of their source material. If Russian audiences love him, it's because for years his was a choreographic voice that gave the impression of flouting the Soviet cultural rulebook. In fact, while notionally \"experimental\", there was little danger of Eifman's work assuming a dissident character, as he deals in none of the shades of grey that make up the satirical palette. Nevertheless the 68-year-old is still, in certain quarters, imputed with subversive genius. He is often classed with the European choreographers Maurice B\u00e9jart and Roland Petit (both of whom were permitted to work in the Soviet Union), and favoured the overwrought style of expressionism that flared in the 1970s and has, for the most part, languished in the taste gulag ever since. Eifman is an efficient nuts-and-bolts man. His choreography is physically fluent, and he knows how to use space dynamically. But Rodin also demonstrates all the failings of his creative style. The full-evening piece presents us with Eifman's reading of the troubled relationship between the sculptor Auguste Rodin (Dmitry Fisher) and his much younger lover Camille Claudel (Aigerim Beketayeva), also a sculptor of note, who was committed to an asylum for the last 30 years of her life. Flamboyant solos and duets for the two principals express the white heat of their creative processes, their mutually destructive erotic attraction, her paranoia and jealous fury, his tortured guilt, her delirium. No one in an Eifman ballet is ever ambivalent. There are no quietly telling details; no inner state is ever expressed in a subtle move or gesture. It's all, from first to last, volcanic. Limbs are outflung, faces contort in silent screams, fists clench. Twenty-three-year-old Beketayeva is a guest artist, on loan from Kazakhstan's Astana Opera House, where she is a principal dancer. Eifman first saw her dance at St Petersburg's Mariinsky theatre earlier this year, when the Astana company was on tour there. Conscious that she is representing not only the young Kazakh company but also her country, Beketayeva has researched the role of Claudel exhaustively, and conjures up an impressive range of expression. She's an attractive and accomplished performer, as is the elegant Fisher. Both imbue the choreography with all the nuance it allows, and execute Eifman's histrionic duets with acrobatic panache. But this is a very odd production, not least visually. Rodin didn't wear skinny-rib sweaters and Lycra pants, to my knowledge, nor was Claudel a champion of stonewashed denim. The recorded music \u2013 black mark for that \u2013 is a random-seeming montage of Ravel, Satie, Massenet and others who have in common only that they are French. There are clever choreographic moments, possibly inspired by Yuri Grigorovich's The Stone Flower, in which the two protagonists create living sculptures, drawing tensile body parts from knotted human forms. But others, such as a comic dance for Rodin's assistants and a pair of saucy life models, are plain silly. And the treatment of mental illness is dismaying, with a chorus of gurning and creepily sexualised female asylum inmates paraded for our amusement. The Eifman faithful love it all, and the ovation as the curtain falls is, as ever, thunderous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
