Only 9% of Conservative MPs are female, compared with 28% of Labour MPs and 16% of Liberal Democrats. Bernard Jenkin, deputy chairman in charge of candidates, yesterday acknowledged that male Tory candidates would outnumber women in winnable seats at the next general election. \"It was only ever a very long shot that 50% of new MPs would be women. We are making substantial progress - barely 11% of our new MPs were women last time and we are going to double or treble that,\" he said. Mr Cameron had promised to take further action if the proportion of women selected fell \"a long way short\" of 50% by this stage. Theresa May, the shadow leader of the Commons, predicted in December that around half the seats would select women. So far under a third of the 20 constituencies to pick would-be MPs have chosen women, and almost half have snubbed A-listers in favour of local candidates. Two have picked ethnic minority candidates. Tim Montgomerie, of Conservativehome.com, which has monitored the selection process, said: \"The record so far is better than the party has been in the past - but it's certainly not meeting the expectation they raised.\" Tory sources initially briefed that 140 winnable seats would pick from a list of around 150 would-be MPs, at least half of whom would be women. They would be able to choose local candidates only in exceptional circumstances. But the list of names has now doubled to around 200. A Conservative spokeswoman said the party would add two more tranches of names later this year and perhaps more next year. She added: \"David Cameron said the priority list would be 50% female - and it is. We are happy with how things are going so far and are giving associations as wide a choice as possible.\" Senior Tories hope that giving local parties a wider choice of candidates will encourage them to choose from the list. But it could also allow them to pick a large number of men. Katherine Rake, director of the Fawcett Society, warned: \"If the Conservatives are to tackle their appallingly low number of women MPs, they have to take radical action. Fawcett believes that at the minimum, women should make up the candidates in half of the winnable seats. \"If the names on the list are topped up too many times, this moves away from the original spirit of the A-list and makes it less likely to deliver more Conservative women MPs.\" There are also concerns that associations are bypassing the list by picking local candidates. Nine of the 20 associations which have already selected would-be MPs have snubbed the list in favour of local candidates, who were supposed to be picked only in exceptional circumstances. \"The current situation enables seats to interview local candidates. We just need to look at ensuring that isn't a backdoor route to just picking the people they would have done anyway,\" a senior Tory said. Modernisers stress that a relatively small number of associations have picked candidates so far, and it is too early to judge the scheme. The selection of three high-profile women in winnable seats - Harriett Baldwin in West Worcestershire, Anna Soubry in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, and Karen Bradley in Staffordshire Moorlands - has boosted morale. But the A-list has been dogged by problems, including the apparent unwillingness of women to apply."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
