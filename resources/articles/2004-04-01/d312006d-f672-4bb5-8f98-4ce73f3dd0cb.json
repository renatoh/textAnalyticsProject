The call centre staff just tell me to write in, but my letters to the company have gone unanswered. Do you have a proper number that I can use to make my complaint? LL A I can certainly see why you've had problems tracking down a number - United's websites is one of the most disorganised, unhelpful pieces of technology I've come across in a while. Despite having a section on how to complain and clearly stating that you can complain by phone, the site neglects to provide any numbers directly, referring visitors to the 'Reporting Problems' page - which, rather unhelpfully, doesn't exist, not even in the site map. This is a bit pathetic from a major utility provider. However, even if you could turn up a number I wouldn't bother wasting time with a phone call if I were you. As your letters have already gone unanswered, I doubt you will get any joy over the phone - assuming you can even get someone to answer a clearly elusive telephone number. It's time to take your complaint to the next level. Set your complaint out in writing again, send your letter recorded delivery, and tell United it has 14 days to resolve the problem to your satisfaction, after which you will refer the matter to the relevant industry regulator, WaterVoice or Energywatch, depending on the service United supplied you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
