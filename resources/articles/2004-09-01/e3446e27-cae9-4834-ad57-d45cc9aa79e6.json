This is not a moot question. To raise dairy cows can be intellectually challenging, in addition to being hard physical work. Every dairy farmer knows this, although it may be news to a small number of milk-guzzling, cheese-chomping city-dwellers. Fordyce Ely and WE Petersen wanted to understand why some cows spew their milk. This was in the early 1940s. Much of the world was at war, which may explain why Ely and Peterson's report, Factors Involved in the Ejection of Milk, made only a little splash when it was published in 1941 in the Journal of Dairy Science. Ely was based at the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station, and Fordyce at a similar institute in Minnesota. Together they made history, using a cat, a cow and a paper bag. They addressed a nagging question: \"Cows that habitually 'let down' or 'hold up' their milk are common in all herds. Several theories have been advanced, but each has been found at fault in some regard.\" In search of the truth, they conducted an experiment. The details deal with complex aspects of the nervous system as it relates to the physiology of bovine udders, but I will concentrate here on just one aspect. Here is the pertinent passage from Ely and Peterson's report: \"It was thought that there might be a difference in the response of the two halves of the udder as measured by the rate of ejection of milk if the cow was severely frightened. Accordingly, [the cow] was systematically frightened as the mechanical milker was attached. Frightening at first consisted in placing a cat on the cow's back and exploding paper bags every 10 seconds for two minutes. Later the cat was dispensed with as unnecessary.\" So far as I have been able to determine, this experiment was conducted only that one time. Other scientists tried to startle human beings. Often, they succeeded. DN May, of the University of Southampton, carried out one such experiment. In a 1971 report, he writes: \"[My] result contradicts a previous finding with animals and suggests that sonic booms are likely to be more startling in quiet environments than noisy ones.\" Not long afterwards, JS Lukas at the Stanford Research Institute exposed some sleeping Californians to recorded aircraft sounds and simulated sonic booms. He found that anyone over the age of eight is likely to notice. Meanwhile, researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm used real jet aeroplanes to produce real sonic booms. They discovered that when you do this at 4am, it awakens the majority of Swedish adults.
