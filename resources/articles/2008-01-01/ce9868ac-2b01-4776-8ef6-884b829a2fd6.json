From what I hear it's kind of like spring break in Florida. Like, girls gone wild ... \" There is a pause. The song Dreadlock Holiday spills across the foyer. \"That,\" frowns his bandmate Matt Camirand, \"sounds totally terrifying.\" Black Mountain are a quintet from Vancouver, made up of frontman McBean and bassist Camirand, along with vocalist Amber Webber, keyboard player Jeremy Schmidt and drummer Joshua Wells. Though their new record, In the Future, a magnificent sprawl and chug of stoner rock and psychedelia, has seen the band tipped as one of the sounds of 2008, they've been together since 2004, and released their self-titled debut in 2005. In the three-year interval since that first record, they have accumulated a slavish fanbase and a reputation for staggering live performances. They also introduced the world to an artistic community they christened the Black Mountain Army, a collective of fellow musicians, photographers, and video-makers, people they had known for the best part of a decade. \"It was a way for us to involve our friends,\" explains Camirand. \"It just seemed cooler to call it an army.\" McBean, slumped in a chair, voice muffled by a raggedy beard, pipes up: \"But the army doesn't really exist any more. It's just the band now. It's just Black Mountain.\" He sniggers. \"The army got torn apart by mutiny.\" Still, a sense of community permeates Black Mountain's work and their recording process. In the Future, for example, was recorded at The Hive, a Vancouver studio that Camirand describes as \"the recording studio equivalent of us: when we were tiny and nothing, their studio in their basement was nothing and tiny. And as we've grown, other bands have gone to record there because they liked our recordings, and we've put more money into it and they've been able to buy more equipment and so it's been growing along with us. It's just a really positive example of everything we've always believed in since we got into music, of helping your friends, of that tiny microcosm of industry that works without The Industry.\" That same sense of community extends beyond their musical endeavours, too: four members of the band work for an organisation that helps the homeless, drug-addicted and mentally ill in downtown Vancouver, where the thoroughfares of Main and Hastings intersect. \"Main and Hastings is the worst place probably in north America for drugs,\" says Camirand. \"It depends what's in vogue. When I started working there it was heroin. And then five years later it was cocaine. And now five years later it's crack and meth.\" Their involvement, they explain, matches the liberal ethos behind the charity, and meets their needs too: \"Our bosses are just cool people who are really into the music we make, and they love for us to go on tour and do our thing and they welcome us back with open arms, so it's a pretty ideal situation for us,\" Camirand explains. \"And when you hang out with a lot of these people, or from their end of it, when they hang out with us, and, yunno, if I give them their medication, it's not like I'm a doctor or a nurse asking them to take their medication, I'm just a cool guy like them who likes rock'n'roll music, and they identify with that. And I think that goes a long way in terms of helping people regain their dignity as a starting point on the road to getting healthy again, if that's what they want.\" In the Future's arrival has been some time coming, the band's fans sustained only by two EPs in the interim. \"We just wanted to make a record that was worthwhile putting out,\" McBean offers as his excuse. \"That's why it took a while, cos we wanted to make something that's special to us and not rushed, and that would be worthwhile, yunno? We waited a bit, so we had the right amount of time, and everyone was in the right space.\" McBean is alluding to the various other musical projects pursued by the members of Black Mountain, including Pink Mountaintops, Blood Meridian, and Lightning Dust, to name but three. Has it been frustrating to wait for everyone to find that time and space to make another Black Mountain recording? \"I think we'd get more annoyed more with people just being in Black Mountain,\" Camirand laughs. \"Doing those other projects gives us the chance to remember why we love each other again. Otherwise I don't know if I could be in a band that long, cos it's like having five girlfriends. It's just too close.\" And does their extracurricular music bring anything to their work with Black Mountain? \"I don't think so, not for me,\" Camirand says. \"Black Mountain is my outlet to play bass and pretend I'm like James Jamerson in Motown, yunno? And then when I do my other band it's my way to outlet my country-rock fantasy. But I can't personally do the other band while I'm doing Black Mountain. I can't divide my brain. It's too stressful for me. Because then you have to start finding time, and you start feeling guilty about who gets what time and how much time you're giving the bands. It's gotta be all Black Mountain, or all Blood Meridian, or whatever the other bands are.\" \"There are certain things that work with certain people,\" McBean says, now practically horizontal, and his voice more of a burble, \"and I like playing with lots of friends and trying different things, and I think it all stems out of the fact that we are all people who have always been obsessed with and love music, and all different kinds of music, and to do all of them in one band, it would be like trying to put too many Cheerios into a bowl.\" He smiles happily at the thought. \"I think the thing is we're all too scattered in our heads, we're all wanderers and restless and wanna move on. You get bored, you know? Like, I always have this thing where I get bored of being in a rock band and so I play acoustic guitar, and then after a while you're like a boring loser playing an acoustic guitar, and I wanna play some rock, or play around with drum machines or whatever. Oh I don't wanna ... \" his voice winds down to a mumble before revving up again, \"it's just, like, that same thing of being alive and wanting to travel and experience new things. You know?\" In their community-spirited ethos and their multitudinous side-projects, Black Mountain naturally recall various other Canadian musical collectives, such as Broken Social Scene in Toronto and Wolf Parade in Montreal. It must be wearisome for Canadian bands to be continually asked about other Canadian bands, of course, but it is a curious fact that so many of them seem to share the same blueprint. \"The thing is that Broken Social Scene and the Montreal people are like us, they grew up listening to the same music as us,\" says Camirand. \"We've all been in bands since our teens and we're all in our 30s now and really it's just the exact same thing in different parts of the country. It all came from grassroots ideas, and these people have stuck with it until they knew enough people who were doing all the aspects to make a record without having to rely on big record labels with big studios. What they're doing in Toronto with Broken Social Scene is pretty similar with the Hive, and in Montreal with all the Wolf Parade guys and Arcade Fire, building their own studios, employing people that they've known for years, it's just the same.\" Like their peers on the east coast of Canada, Black Mountain have thus far rejected the overtures of major labels to remain with the indie Jagjaguwar. \"It's that same thing as with the Hive,\" says McBean. \"They've treated us great and so why would we want to take a chance to be 20 leagues under ...\", he hesitates, \"I dunno who's popular right now.\" Camirand nods: \"We've been around long enough that we saw our generation's heyday of major labels stream in, and all these bands that signed to them didn't make it. Green Day is the only one that made a go of it and lasted. And it's so bad these days. If you talked to any one of those people those days they would not sign to a major label. It's just not the time for it. Major labels don't even know what they're doing, or if they're gonna have a job next week. They're floundering. And what we've done, and to us is a great success and to our parents and everyone, to a boardroom would be a complete and utter failure.\" McBean shuffles up in his chair. \"When we first met I was in a punk band - to say punk, it means a different thing now, but then it was more a way of doing things, being underground, living life to the best of your abilities, and doing things you want the way you want. That's what we're doing, because it sticks with you in a certain way, the punk attitude sticks with you.\" \u00b7 In the Future by Black Mountain is released on January 21"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
