The phrase helps \u201cweaponise\u201d descriptions of abortions, claim a group of family planning specialists that includes Marie Stopes International, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. They wrote recently to the corporation to request it stop using the term, claiming it is \u201cat odds\u201d with the BBC\u2019s editorial standards and royal charter that \u201crequire the corporation to treat subjects with \u2018due impartiality\u2019\u201d. The alliance\u2019s letter, seen by the Guardian, said: \u201cAnti-abortionists coined the phrase in a clear attempt to frame the debate on their own emotional and empathetic terms. \u201cAs an international broadcaster with a global weekly reach in 2018 of 376 million people, [the BBC] \u2026 has a duty to avoid being complicit, however unknowingly, in the aggressive campaign by anti-abortion extremists worldwide attempting to rob women of their rights and care.\u201d It also said the term \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d was \u201cmedically inaccurate. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has made this clear; there is no detectable heartbeat at six weeks. \u201cAdding the words \u2018so-called\u2019 or placing the phrase in parentheses will not address this bias; only a commitment to its removal from BBC coverage of abortion from now on can restore the balance the corporation rightly demands and expects of itself.\u201d The BBC\u2019s director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, said in response: \u201cWe would not aim to adopt it as our own description of the legislation \u2026 I\u2019m afraid that I disagree with you when you suggest that we should cease using the expression entirely. \u201cI do not think our reporting can avoid the fact that the phrase is now in common usage. We will continue to place \u2018heartbeat bill\u2019 in quotation marks or to attribute it, but our overall aim will always be to try to explain the precise nature of the bill, rather than rely on shorthand coined by others.\u201d The director general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Dr Alvaro Bermejo, urged the BBC to \u201cthink again\u201d. He said the BBC could not \u201cconcede \u2018heartbeat bill\u2019 is a biased and medically inaccurate description and then say it\u2019s going to use it anyway\u201d. Bermejo said: \u201cSaying it is \u2018in common usage\u2019 is no excuse, especially when the BBC \u2026 shares the blame for spreading it.\u201d The IPPF pointed out that others, including the Guardian, had announced they would avoid using the phrase. Bermejo added: \u201cLanguage around legal abortion has been weaponised by those who want to deny women access to it and journalists \u2013 especially those who work for a news organisation which claims to be impartial and trusted \u2013 must wake up and see they are being played. \u201cThis phrase was chosen very carefully by people who want to end access to legal abortion and who are exploiting the mainstream media to insert dangerously emotive language into the common vernacular. The right thing to do is to stop using it. We call on the BBC to think again.\u201d The BBC declined a request to comment further."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
