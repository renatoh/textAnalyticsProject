Chiara de Blasio said that she dealt with feelings of depression in college by drinking and taking drugs. \u201cIt made it easier, the more I drank and did drugs, to share some common ground with people I wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d de Blasio said. She said she was able to end her dependence on substances after her therapist referred her to a group therapy program at an outpatient treatment center in New York City. \u201cGetting sober is always a positive thing and it\u2019s not easy, by no means is it easy,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done, but it\u2019s so worth it.\u201d Chiara de Blasio and her parents said they were releasing the video to help other teenagers dealing with similar problems. She credited sobriety with helping her focus on more things, including being able to aid her father\u2019s successful mayoral campaign. \u201cI wanted to speak out because people are suffering from this disease, and dying from this disease every day, and we really can\u2019t do anything as a society to help those people until we start talking about it,\u201d she said. The video was released in an email from her parents, Bill and Chirlane de Blasio, a week before Bill is sworn into office. They said they were releasing the video now because the holiday period can be more difficult for people dealing with clinical depression and substance abuse issues. The de Blasios said in the email: As parents, our instinct has been to protect our daughter and privately help her through a deeply personal struggle. But not only has Chiara committed to her own health, she is also committed to helping young people everywhere who face similar challenges. Her courage to speak out demonstrates a wisdom and maturity far beyond her 19 years, and we are grateful every day for her commitment to lifting up those who need to know that they are not alone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
