He was admitted to the hospital's acute department after first going to the Stoke Mandeville hospital near Chequers. Number 10 immediately played down the incident, but the image of the youthful prime minister struck down by a heart condition sent shock waves through the government. The hospital described the treatment as cardioversion, which normally means he was either injected with chemicals or given an electric shock to restore a normal heart rhythm. Downing Street stressed that he was allowed to leave by doctors within six hours. His officials insisted that his prompt return to No 10 told its own story, insisting there was not a deeper problem. Mr Blair has been ordered to rest for 24 hours and the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, will deputise at a Commons statement today on the outcome of last week's EU Summit. Number 10 said the prime minister would be back on full duty tomorrow and vehemently denied that his high stress job, including his worst year of his six year premiership, had contributed to yesterday's attack. Downing St said: \"This morning the prime minister was feeling under the weather and went to Stoke Mandeville hospital where they advised him to go to the Hammersmith. There it was established he had an irregular heartbeat and a cardioversion was administered to regulate it. This was completely successful. He was in hospital for four to five hours and is now back at No 10.\" Mr Blair's aides also emphasised that, according to the hospital, he had experienced a relatively common condition which was \"easily treated\". \"He has suffered no damage and he is fine. There is no reason why this should reoccur. They have advised him to rest for 24 hours.\" Despite the words of comfort, Mr Blair, his family and political entourage will be deeply disturbed by the revelation that he has any kind of heart condition. He is 50 and has been seen as a young, vigorous prime minister who had returned from holiday looking fit and ready for battle. Downing St was unable to say whether he would be cutting back on his punishing schedule. It broke the news within two hours of Mr Blair returning to No 10. Mr Blair was rushed to hospital at lunchtime when he felt a little unwell, uneasy and suffering a shortness of breath. A sudden attack of palpitations, or irregular heartbeat, is not uncommon and in most people is not serious. But there is a condition called ventricular tachycardia which can need immediate medical treatment. Here the heart is pulsating at between 120 and 200 beats a minute - the normal rate is between 50 and 100 beats - in the ventricles, which are the two large chambers of the heart, while the rate in the two smaller chambers called the atria remains the same. Ventricular tachycardia is usually a result of heart disease, but can also occur in healthy people. The first symptoms can be faintness and palpitations with a feeling of breathlessness or chest pain. If doctors feel they need to act at once to stop the attack they will carry out a cardioversion, which is a small electric shock, carefully timed to trip the heart back into its normal rhythm. The patient will be under sedation. A patient with the condition ventricular tachycardia is likely to be sent home with drugs to reduce the risk of another attack. Regular testing will be required to ensure the drugs are controlling the condition. If they do not, surgery may be needed to investigate the area causing the irregular rhythm, or the patient will have a tiny device called a defibrillator implanted in their chest, which will give out a small electrical impulse whenever the irregular rhythms begin, to get the heart back on a normal beat. A less serious condition, called atrial fibrillation, occurs more frequently in older people. It causes the atria - the small chambers of the heart - to beat very rapidly, at up to 400 beats a minute. Not all the beats are passed on to the large chambers - the ventricles - so they end up beating irregularly at around 180 beats per minute. This is unpleasant and can cause breathlessness, but is not immediately dangerous. Too much alcohol and high blood pressure are among the causes of this condition. Treatment includes cardioversion and the heart drug digoxin which slows the beat. During Mr Blair's six years in office he has always conducted his premiership at an intense pace, taking on personal responsibility across the foreign and domestic affairs spectrum. He has a young family, including Leo, two, and takes his responsibilities as a father seriously. He had already promised to cut back his command and control of the government as well as his foreign travel, after two years of shuttle diplomacy. One of his great skills has been to manage the intense stress of 24 hour politics, partly by compartmentalising separate problems. The health scare will inevitably lead to speculation as to whether he has the strength, and the political will, to carry on. If he feels the need to take time out, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, will take the helm, even though Gordon Brown, the chancellor and new father, is the natural successor. The past year has been the most gruelling of Mr Blair's premiership after the decision to support the US invasion of Iraq and the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction. Through the summer he has been forced to defend his role in the government's naming of Dr David Kelly, the government scientist who committed suicide. The Kelly affair has seen the prime minister lose his closest political ally, Alastair Campbell. During his speech at the party conference last month Mr Blair told delegates: \"I look my age. You feel yours. I've had plenty of advice over what I should say in this speech. Some of it I have even asked for. One suggestion was leading you all in a chorus of Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
