Israel's players might be spending this week in one of England's most genteel seaside resorts, but thoughts of their country's developing conflict with Hizbullah in Lebanon are unlikely to be far away. Israel's No3 player Noam Okun took a break from hitting yesterday to talk to his parents via videophone and listened as they described bombs falling a few hundred metres from their house in Haifa, 30 miles from the Lebanese border. All of which must have brought this weekend's Euro-African Zone Group 1 tie, the purpose of which is to avoid a relegation tie in September, into sharp perspective. \"There are bombs while the alarms are going all the time and from their house window, they can see the home that was bombed,\" he explained. \"Every house, including ours, has to have a shelter. It is a bad situation in Israel. \"Before leaving Israel, I had a dream we would be in a war when I was over here. I never normally tell my girlfriend my dreams. But in this dream, I saw the war. One soldier was kidnapped, then the other soldiers and then the war started. It is tough to see. Now, there is a war. You can see sport is not everything. Life, health and family are much more important.\" \"It's not easy,\" said Okun's team-mate Andy Ram, who can expect to be involved in singles and doubles during the three-day tie. \"They start to bomb the north, Haifa, places like this, and we were not expecting that. It's not easy when you are here and you hear all about it on the news, about one dying here, one dying there. Half of the team is from Haifa and their families are hiding in the basement. They are calling home every day and listening closely to the news. We try to stay focused on the sport and not to get involved.\" Ram admits that this is easier said than done, even if providing a distraction for sports fans back home is a motivating factor for him and his team-mates. \"Every team which represents Israel has to go through tough times like this,\" he said. \"We don't have a lot of sporting success outside Israel so the little success we have is bringing lots of happiness to the country. Hopefully we can do it this weekend. We know that we have to represent Israel and play for our country the best way we can and I think we are doing it, not just here but in all the big tournaments, in Wimbledon and everywhere.\" Ram is well aware of the impact of sporting success on a country which seldom has the luxury of being interested in much outside of politics. When he won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title with Vera Zvonareva 12 days ago, he was mobbed on his return home to Tel Aviv and even received a congratulatory phone call from the Israeli prime minister. It marked Israel's first-ever grand slam title and, while a Davis Cup win over Great Britain would not cause quite such a stir, Israeli sports fans are now more in need than ever of something to celebrate. \"We are trying to bring some good news to the Israeli people, to give them a few things they can enjoy,\" said Ram."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
