A comment I had in the mail from Ovum researcher David Mitchell said: \"The timing of the European Commission announcement could not have been worse - for both sides.\" It looks to me like either malevolence or stupidity, and neither could be considered good. Mitchell argues that: The remedies introduced by the European Commission have been largely ineffectual in improving the dynamics of the European technology industry, having been badly conceptualised in the first place. The market has also moved on since 2004, with much greater competition being generated from innovative technology and services companies from across the world. In that context the European Commission's intervention begins to look like an attempt to regulate the market for monastic scribes after the introduction of the printing press - somewhat irrelevant. Microsoft is also a dramatically different company from the one that was brought to task in 2004. It has diversified its business into the online services market, is stronger in the database market, has a vibrant CRM and ERP business, has a more advanced games division, etc... It is no longer the Windows and Office company, and no longer behaves like that. Of course, zealots don't have to look far for an explanation. The EC seems to take much the same line as the European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS). which sounds like it ought to be a Good Thing. But it isn't. ECIS is just a front organisation for IBM, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Adobe and Red Hat: in other words, the Anything But Microsoft party. ECIS is just a roundabout way of manipulating markets to try to gain competitive advantage. Mitchell has also noticed the start of a backlash in responses and says: \"Of course, there were many anti-Microsoft comments too but the fact that pro-Microsoft comments are increasingly appearing is startling. The European Commission needs to take care that it is not seen to be a servant of the ABM (Anything But Microsoft) lobby that is gathering momentum across corners of the globe.\" \"A wave of adverse sentiment against the European Commission's handling of the case is building up and [it] needs to take care to protect and demonstrate the legitimacy of its actions.\" Well, it can try. But how much credibility can a body retain after its mind-numbingly clueless and stupid insistence on Microsoft offering European versions of Windows without Windows Media Player?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
