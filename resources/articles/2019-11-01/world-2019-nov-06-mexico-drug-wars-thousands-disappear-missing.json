They don\u2019t leave people alive,\u201d the 62-year-old said as he slalomed through the parched scrubland of tumbleweed and cacti where they had played as kids. \u201cOnce they take someone they don\u2019t let you live.\u201d It has been six months since Jos\u00e9 Barajas was snatched from his home near the US border, for reasons that remain obscure. \u201cI think he was working so hard that he forgot his own safety, you know?\u201d Jesse said as he recounted how his 57-year-old brother was dragged from his ranch and joined the ever-swelling ranks of Mexico\u2019s desaparecidos \u2013 now estimated to number at least 40,000 people. Jesse, the eldest of seven siblings, said US-based relatives had implored Jos\u00e9 to join them north of the border as the cartels tightened their grip on a region notorious for the smuggling of drugs and people. \u201cWe told him how big a monster is organised crime. It is a huge monster that nobody knows where it is hiding,\u201d he said. But Jos\u00e9 \u2013 who had built a successful business making decorative concrete columns for ranches and was in the process of erecting a new house \u2013 was adamant he would abandon neither his workers nor his homeland. \u201cHe was a man that believed in Mexico,\u201d said Jesse, who left Mexico as an undocumented migrant aged 14 and is now a US citizen. \u201cHe chose to stay here because he thought that he could change things, you know?\u201d The disappeared are perhaps the dirtiest secret of Mexico\u2019s drug conflict, which has shown no sign of easing since leftist leader Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took power last December promising a new era of peace. In August Mexican authorities, who after years of public pressure are beginning to demonstrate greater interest in investigating such crimes, acknowledged over 3,000 clandestine burial sites. More than 500 had been discovered since L\u00f3pez Obrador took power. One as-yet undiscovered grave is thought to guard the remains of Jos\u00e9 Barajas. And one recent morning his family set off to find it, in the company of a government forensic team and \u2013 a heavily armed federal police escort. \u201cIt just sucks not knowing where he\u2019s at,\u201d said the missing man\u2019s 28-year-old son, who is also called Jos\u00e9 and had travelled from California to join the search. The mission \u2013 one of the first conducted in conjunction with a newly created state search commission \u2013 began shortly before noon as searchers formed a human chain to comb a stony heath east of Jos\u00e9\u2019s ranch. Jesse struck out ahead, pausing occasionally to skewer the ground with his machete. After puncturing the earth, he would raise the blade\u2019s tip to his nose in the hope of detecting the sickly scent that might reveal the whereabouts of his brother\u2019s corpse. Other searchers probed soft patches of soil with T-shaped steel rods. Minutes later, Jesse spotted a black bomber jacket, half buried in the soil. He quickly decided it was not his brother\u2019s but photographed the garment with his smartphone: \u201cMaybe somebody is looking for somebody with this jacket, huh?\u201d As Jesse marched on \u2013 shadowed by a rifle-toting police agent \u2013 the hidden perils that lay behind his brother\u2019s disappearance became clear. Pickup trucks, apparently sent by cartel bosses to monitor the search party, rattled past on the country lane down which Jos\u00e9\u2019s abductors fled. \u201cThese assholes are halcones,\u201d Jesse complained, using the Spanish slang word for lookouts. Unsettled by their presence, Jesse radioed another nearby search team to request a protective roadblock. \u201cThey\u2019re spying on us \u2026 watching our movements to see what we are looking for and what we are doing,\u201d the police officer said. Nerves jangled as the hawks continued to circle. \u201cThe criminals here are very bloody. They are beyond limits,\u201d Jesse murmured as the police agent trained his gun on the road. Twenty tense minutes later, reinforcements arrived. But the drama was not yet over. As Jesse clambered into the open back of a police vehicle two shiny SUVs appeared on the horizon and sped down the sun-cracked asphalt towards the group, before being forced to stop. As the police car\u2019s occupants braced for a gunfight, two men descended from the first SUV and exchanged a few inaudible words with the federal agents before the second car was allowed to pass unmolested. The identity of its occupants remained a mystery. But as the vehicle raced away it left the unshakable impression that a local crime boss had been inside \u2013 and a serious confrontation narrowly avoided. \u201cWe\u2019re in a hostile place \u2013 and it\u2019s not Iraq,\u201d Jesse said as the team regrouped, heaving a collective sigh of relief. After a lunch of energy drinks and granola bars, the hunt for Jos\u00e9 resumed. \u201cAll we want to do is give him a proper burial, like every human,\u201d the missing man\u2019s son as a sniffer dog joined the search. Jos\u00e9\u2019s son said relatives had not told his 92-year-old grandmother, who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s, what had happened and had yet to fully comprehend it themselves. \u201cI guess we have to be OK with not being OK,\u201d he said. Once his father was found, Jos\u00e9 said the family would sell up and cut ties with the land his father had so loved. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same any more, you know what I mean?\u201d Three hours later, nothing had been found but coyote bones and clothes ditched by migrants as they trekked towards the US. Back at his brother\u2019s ranch, Jesse busied himself handing out burritos and spicy nachos to the famished searchers. Fernando Ocegueda, the activist who had organized the mission, insisted searchers should keep faith. \u201cOnce we spent 15 days searching and found nothing \u2013 and on the last day we found three bodies.\u201d \u201cThis kind of activism is about patience, not speed,\u201d Ocegueda later added. Two days later, after a second fruitless hunt near the ranch, the Barajas family headed south to join another search, though this time not for Jos\u00e9. Outside a police station in the coastal town of Ensenada they met dozens of mostly female searchers \u2013 members of a local \u201ccollective\u201dhoping to find their loved ones. As the group explored its first location \u2013 a rocky wasteland behind the town\u2019s country club \u2013 terrible stories of violence, fear and grief emerged. \u201cIt was my nephew. They took him 18 days ago,\u201d said one thirtysomething woman, who \u2013 like all of the collective\u2019s members \u2013 asked not to be identified for fear of the cartels. \u201cMy brother,\u201d said a 15-year-old boy as he pummeled the earth with a shovel. \u201cThree weeks.\u201d Another woman said she was seeking her son. \u201cIn December it will be six years since they disappeared him \u2026 and I\u2019ve been in this fight ever since,\u201d she said. As the minutes and hours ticked by and no bodies were found, bloodshot eyes shed tears of sorrow and there were crossed words of frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s like looking for a needle in a haystack,\u201d Jos\u00e9\u2019s son complained after a traipse through the wasteland found only swarms of bees and a poisonous snake. But as the group moved from the viper-infested wild to a reeking landfill and, finally, a junkyard police suspected had served as a torture centre and burial ground, there was also camaraderie and warmth. The bleakness of the task was tempered by shared experiences and laughter. Jokes were told. New friendships formed. \u201cWe all have the same goal, which is finding our missing ones,\u201d said Ocegueda who became a campaigner after his own son was taken, in 2007, and has recovered more than 120 bodies since. Ocegueda has yet to locate his son \u2013 but he has found a calling. \u201cThis is where I like to be because it\u2019s here I\u2019ve found my people,\u201d the 62-year-old said. \u201cAlong the way you make friends \u2013 and this is the most important thing.\u201d Also present was a woman still grappling with a more recent loss: Jos\u00e9\u2019s 49-year-old wife, Irma Bonilla Barajas. Visibly drained, Irma threw herself into the search operation, determined to bring others closure, even if she had yet to find it herself. Pausing from her digging, Irma remembered a hardworking family man whose absence was still sinking in. \u201cHe was so, so intelligent,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to calculate all the exact measurements for the concrete and his gazebos in his head.\u201d Six months after Jos\u00e9 vanished, Irma voiced bewilderment at the \u201cevil minds\u201d responsible for snatching so many Mexican lives. \u201cI just can\u2019t make sense of it \u2026 If they\u2019ve already killed them, why don\u2019t they leave them for us?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWhat more harm can they do to them, if they are already dead?\u201d Additional reporting by Jordi Lebrija"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
