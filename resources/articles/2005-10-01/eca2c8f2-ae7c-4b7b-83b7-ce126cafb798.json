Degussa said the bulk of the charge related to Laporte in Britain, which it bought in 2001. Degussa had already begun restructuring its fine chemicals business with the loss of up to 700 jobs by 2007 and warned that further cuts could follow. Several fine chemicals makers have reported downturns recently, in part due to increasing competition from rivals in Asia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
