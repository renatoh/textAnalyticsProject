He is ranked No29 in the world, but he has been lifted 19 places on the strength of his grass-court record. Henman last year was seeded No4, the highest of his career, although he was then in the world's top five. Surgery on his right shoulder in November caused the British No1 to miss the Australian Open and so far this year he has played only 18 matches, winning nine. Unlike the three other grand-slam tournaments, Wimbledon does not seed strictly according to the ATP rankings and has devised a formula for the men whereby a player's recent record on grass is taken into account. This was introduced two years ago after consultation between the All England Club and the men's governing body. Previously a seeding committee placed the leading players in the draw, but this was eventually deemed too subjective. Numerous players boycotted Wimbledon three years ago, including Gustavo Kuerten, then French Open champion. This year all the leading clay-court specialists will be present except Carlos Moya, the world No4, who is injured. Others to benefit significantly from the formula include Xavier Malisse, a semi-finalist last year who climbs from 31st to No14 seed, and the 20-year-old Mikhail Youzhny, who has won six of his eight matches at Wimbledon. He rises from world No25 to 16th seed. Lleyton Hewitt, the champion, is seeded No1 despite losing his world top place to Andre Agassi last week. Agassi, champion here 10 years ago, is second with Juan Carlos Ferrero, the French Open champion, third and Roger Federer at four. Andy Roddick, winner at Queen's, is seeded fifth. Greg Rusedski, Britain's No2, is unseeded and will be a dangerous floater in this morning's draw, along with Mark Philippoussis, Mario Ancic and Taylor Dent, all big servers. The formula is not applied to the women, seeded according to WTA ranking. The champion Serena Williams is top with Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin-Hardenne, the French champion, two and three, and Venus Williams four. Anna Kournikova has pulled out of Wimbledon because of a recurring back injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
