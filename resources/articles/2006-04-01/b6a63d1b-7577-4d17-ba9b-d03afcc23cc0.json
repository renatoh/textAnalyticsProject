Terry Lubbock was offered a modest payment of \u00a32,000 for that meeting, and insisted that the entire \u00a32,000 was paid into The Lubbock Trust, formed in January 2006 to pursue the quest for the truth about the violent assault on his son, which he believes caused his death. He has not received a penny from the trust, which has used what funds it has raised mainly to develop a website and to offer a reward of \u00a320,000 for information leading to the conviction of the person or persons who assaulted Stuart Lubbock that night five years ago. To portray Terry Lubbock as \"cannily\" profiting from the Sun was therefore wholly inaccurate.
