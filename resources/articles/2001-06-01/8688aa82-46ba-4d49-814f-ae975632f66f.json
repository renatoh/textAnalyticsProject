York and Herefordshire are among the other star performers, while Brighton is continuing its relentless climb up the house price league table, according to the Land Registry. Its figures came in the same week that Nationwide building society said it expects the housing market to remain healthy over the coming months. It rejected suggestions that house prices could be set to collapse. The Land Registry figures provide a comprehensive overview of what's been happening over the past year. They reveal that the housing market does seem to be slowing down, with the price of the average home in England and Wales up just 7.6% on a year ago - from \u00a3102,749 to \u00a3110,570. A year ago the annual rate of house price growth was running at more than double this - 16.8%. However, it could be argued that these UK-wide figures are virtually meaningless because they disguise dramatic regional variations. For example, the area where prices are rising at their fastest rate is East Anglia, where the average cost of a home has surged by 13.8% in a year, from \u00a382,481 to \u00a393,874. Compare that with Wales, the region seeing the slowest growth, where average prices rose just 3.6% over the same period, from \u00a362,092 to \u00a364,346. In London, the price of a typical home has climbed only 7.1% (from \u00a3183,339 to \u00a3196,437). However, even these regional figures don't tell anything like the full story. London is a good case in point. The Land Registry figures reveal that Westminster has been toppled as the capital's most expensive borough. Inexplicably, the price of an average home in Westminster plummeted by \u00a3129,000, or 25%, in a year, falling from \u00a3527,678 to \u00a3398,096. That means the \"top spot\" goes to Kensington &amp; Chelsea, where the average price tag is now a hefty \u00a3570,960 (up from \u00a3496,977 a year ago). The district that notched up the biggest rise is the City of London, where property values soared by 37% to \u00a3284,373. Other strong performers include Merton and Lambeth (both up 24% to \u00a3219,029 and \u00a3185,663 respectively). Several other boroughs experienced much more modest increases. In Islington the average price rose only 3% to \u00a3233,853. Looking around the country, Brighton is continuing to see very strong price growth. The average property there now costs \u00a3125,247, up 18% on a year ago. York, Milton Keynes and the Isle of Wight are also firmly on the up - average prices in all three locations have risen around 18% to \u00a394,668, \u00a3100,343 and \u00a395,473 respectively. The surprise star performer is Warrington, Cheshire, where the average property has increased in value by 27.5% - a \u00a320,000 gain. The typical price there is now \u00a391,189 as opposed to \u00a371,501 in the first quarter of last year. These figures show that, although price growth in London is slowing, other areas that spent a period in the doldrums are now surging forward as the upturn in the market ripples out across the country. Many parts of East Anglia are benefiting as growing numbers of disaffected Londoners look further afield to areas that still allow them to commute but where they can get a decent-sized house with a garden for the price of a shoebox in Islington. In Cambridgeshire and Essex, average prices are up 15% and 12% to \u00a3117,848 and \u00a3116,783 respectively. The strength of the housing market in East Anglia was also noted by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in a report this week in which it said the region had benefited from sustained job creation during the last year. East Anglia's chartered surveyors are very confident that prices will continue rising in the coming few months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
