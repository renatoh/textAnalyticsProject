Japan and China appeared to be over the worst of the coronavirus epidemic, so the thinking went, and most of Europe was still open. So a decision was made: to push on, to wait, to hope. That hope continued to flicker, even as the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, major sports shut down, and more countries entered lockdown. The Olympic flame was lit on a still March morning in Olympia, Greece and Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, insisted there was \u201cno plan B\u201d. But on 17 March, there was a subtle, almost imperceptible, shift missed by almost everyone. Speaking after chatting to G7 leaders, Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said: \u201cI want to hold the Olympics and Paralympics perfectly, as proof that the human race will conquer coronavirus, and I gained support for that from the G7 leaders.\u201d To most people that sounded innocuous. But in the IOC and elsewhere, ears started to tingle. It was not what Abe had said. Rather, it was what he had not. For the first time, Japan\u2019s leader did not mention hosting the Games in July 2020. From that moment on the decision to postpone the Games was inevitable, according to multiple conversations with those inside the Olympic movement about how the world\u2019s greatest sporting event came to be put back a year. The big question now was when \u2013 and how \u2013 it would happen. But it appears it was actually the Japanese who were the most reluctant to move the Games \u2013 while Bach was actively if quietly pushing for a postponement for some time. The problem was that the IOC could not move unless it got the Tokyo organisers on board. And that, to put it mildly, was not straightforward. The greatest difficulty was that the Japanese could not be seen to lose face. Another was that organisers were keen on holding the Games in October, while Bach felt it had to be 2021 because there was no guarantee that the Covid-19 virus would be under control by the autumn. A third problem was that Tokyo wanted a four-week deadline to work through the issues \u2013 something the IOC reluctantly granted on Sunday. But that did not stop Bach stealthily putting the wheels in motion to bring the deadline forward. It was not a coincidence that the Australian Olympic Committee was one of the first to call for the Games to be moved to 2021. The AOC\u2019s president, John Coates, is a close friend of Bach \u2013 and chair of the IOC\u2019s coordination commission for Tokyo. Bach knew he needed more negotiating cards. This was one of his strongest. As Michael Payne, a former senior marketing executive at the IOC who still has close ties to the Olympic movement, explains: \u201cThe IOC was both officially and through its back channels clearly applying major pressure to get to a quick decision, because it realised that the delay was damaging to athletes and their preparations.\u201d Payne, who handled the $1bn deal between Chinese group Alibaba and the IOC, adds: \u201cBut there was also a lot of political negotiations and delicate diplomacy involved to make sure the Japanese don\u2019t lose face.\u201d That explains why the IOC was happy for Abe to \u201cpropose\u201d a delay on Tuesday \u2013 which, of course, Bach quickly accepted. How could it not be, given the ever-sharpening criticisms from athletes who questioned why the IOC needed so long to reach a decision. Dina Asher-Smith, the world 200m champion, was particularly blunt: \u201cDoes this mean that athletes face up to another FOUR weeks of finding ways to fit in training \u2013 whilst potentially putting ourselves, coaches, support staff, and loved ones at risk just to find out they were going to be postponed anyway?\u201d Meanwhile, Dai Greene, the former 400m hurdles world champion, said he was having to flip tractor tyres on his partner\u2019s farm and use bales of hay for box jumps because gyms were shut. \u201cOn Saturday morning, I went to recce the local 400m track by one of the private schools near where I live,\u201d he added. \u201cI even had a look at the fence and wondered to myself \u2013 can I jump over it?\u201d Greene was lucky. With Britain in lockdown, most athletes could barely train at all. The Guardian understands the British Olympic Association also took a strong position in talks with the IOC last week. While offering its support for hosting the Games in July, it came with a heavy caveat: if British athletes were unable to train because of the Covid-19 outbreak, the BOA would publicly call for the Games to be postponed. The BOA also increasingly felt that morally there was no way it could take a team to the Olympics in the midst of a pandemic. How, as one source put it, could they justify taking team doctors away from a national health crisis? Especially when its chief medical officer, Niall Elliott, was on the front line in Scotland? A private opinion poll of more than 1,000 people reinforced the BOA\u2019s position. It found that only 5% of Britons wanted the Games to go ahead in July. So what now? It is almost certain the Olympics \u2013 which will still be branded Tokyo 2020 \u2013 will be staged in July 2021, although some IOC members have raised the prospect of a \u201ccherry blossom\u201d Games next April. That seems unlikely. Would the US media giant NBC, one of the IOC\u2019s biggest financial backers, really want a Games to clash with the latter stages of the NBA season? It would almost certainly be easier to try again in July next year. World Athletics has already indicated that it will be happy to shift its 2021 championships, which are due to take place in Eugene, to 2022, and Fina, the organisers of the 2021 swimming world championships in Japan in July, has indicated it too could reschedule. Of course there will still be major headaches \u2013 not least ensuring that venues can be freed up for whenever the Games take place. As Sebastian Coe, who ran the London 2012 Games and now heads World Athletics, put it after the IOC\u2019s announcement: \u201cThere is no project management that challenges a city or country like the Olympics does,\u201d and the cost to organisers from the delay is expected to be at least \u00a32bn. Some of the headaches, however, may not be as great as assumed. The IOC will still get millions in broadcasting and sponsor revenues so long as the event takes place, much of which it will pass on to the sports movement. And while there has been some ill-informed speculation about whether a new athletes\u2019 village will have to be built, that is not a major concern given the 5,500 apartments in the village sold on to private owners for use after the Games do not have to be delivered to them until 2023 \u2013 and, as yet, only 500 have been sold. Meanwhile, among those in the Olympic movement there is a hope that the Tokyo Games in 2021 will become a joyous celebration of humanity and harmony after the devastation of coronavirus \u2013 much like the Salt Lake City Winter Games in 2002 helped America heal after September 11. \u201cThe leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times, and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. Such pronouncements usually sound trite. But, in these dark and uncertain times, it struck pretty much the perfect note."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
