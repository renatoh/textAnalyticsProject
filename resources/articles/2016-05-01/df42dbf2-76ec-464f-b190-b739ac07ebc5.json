On Monday it hijacked the insurer QBE\u2019s branding in Sydney, plastering the slogan \u201cMade possible by QBE\u201d over images of coalmines and natural disasters. At about 8am on Monday morning the Market Forces team hung the posters from the QBE headquarters in Sydney\u2019s CBD. Julien Vincent, executive director of Market Forces said they were removed by security after about 10 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s about highlighting their role in the perpetuation and expansion of the fossil fuel industry, which is contributing to climate change,\u201d said Gocher, who worked for QBE until 2015. \u201cBecause as their slogan tells you, they make it possible.\u201d The activists\u2019 imagery is very similar to one produced by QBE a few years ago. In 2012 the its annual report printed \u201cMade possible by QBE\u201d on the cover, over an image of an operating coalmine. In that report, the company boasted it was \u201ca major insurer of the mining sector in Australia\u201d and insured \u201ccoalminers in the Queensland Bowen Basin and New South Wales Hunter Valley\u201d. Finding out exactly how much insurers were underwriting coal and other fossil fuel projects was difficult, Vincent said. \u201cThe way you learn about it is when there\u2019s been a disaster,\u201d he said. When the world\u2019s largest oil leak occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, it was revealed BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon oil extraction was insured by QBE. Gocher said the group would target other insurers, but QBE was an obvious place to start because it had revealed some of its involvement in the sector. Insurers also held large investment portfolios, Gocher said. Australian insurance companies managed about $200bn worth of stock, $35bn of it held by QBE. Some other insurers have begun to move away from fossil fuels. The French insurer AXA and Germany\u2019s Allianz divested from thermal coal because of climate change. Overseas insurers and reinsurers (companies that insure other insurance companies) have played a significant role in public discussion of climate change after recognising they were particularly exposed to the effects of extreme weather events. In 2015 Muich RE said: \u201cWe are convinced that there are particular regions and hazards where climate change is already having a definite influence on losses. Significant effects have to be accounted for in risk management approaches of the insurance industry.\u201d But despite being hit with large payouts, Australian insurers lagged behind their foreign counterparts, not divesting from fossil fuels and not playing a role in the public discussion, Gocher said. Annual reports show QBE paid US$76m for storms that battered the New South Wales coast in 2014; US$144m for storms Desmond, Eva and Frank in the UK in 2015; US$108m for cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March. Market Forces has asked Australian insurers to divest from fossil fuel in their investment portfolios, begin withdrawing from underwriting fossil fuel companies and play a role in the public conversation about climate change. Gocher said withdrawal from underwriting could not be done overnight, but companies could immediately cease underwriting new projects.
