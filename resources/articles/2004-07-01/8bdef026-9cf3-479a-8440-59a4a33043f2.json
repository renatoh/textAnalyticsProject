Almost immediately one started attracting the wrong kind of headlines. Six months in, a new chief executive had been parachuted in over the head of the principal of the Greig City Academy in Haringey, north London, after an unofficial Ofsted inspection found indiscipline was endemic and more than one in four lessons were below standard - the very mix that had caused the original school, St David and St Katharine, to be closed. A further nine academies opened last September; two of these are also getting more than their fair share of negative attention. The King's Academy in Middlesbrough has fought, and failed, to shrug off the controversy stirred up by its sponsor, Sir Peter Vardy, the car-hire knight with unorthodox views on creationism that he has sought to impose on the curriculum. Vardy's biggest achievement, one might argue, has been to unite the Bishop of Oxford and Richard Dawkins (professor of the public understanding of science at Oxford University and pronounced atheist) in their opposition to Vardy's involvement in education. In London, the Capital City Academy has been dogged by complaints about the design of the building and ran into financial difficulties this April with the announcement of seven staff redundancies. The headteacher has resigned after less than a year in charge. And yet, despite the absence of any cost-effective evaluation of these pilots - the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) has commissioned some as-yet unpublished research from PricewaterhouseCoopers - the government announced the expansion of the scheme in its five-year plan, setting a target of 200 new academies by 2010. \"We have confidence in the ability of academies to turn around standards in some of the country's most economically and educationally disadvantaged areas,\" said a DfES spokesperson. The department points out that overall, academies have doubled their GCSE pass rate to 24%. When it comes to failing schools in deprived areas, academies are the only show in town. The city academy programme was created in March 2000 by David Blunkett, then education secretary, as \"a radical approach to promote greater diversity and break the cycle of failing schools in inner cities\". (The \"city\" has since been dropped, to allow for the creation of academies outside cities.) It may not be a completely faithful reinvention of the wheel, but academies do share one of the hallmarks of Fresh Start, the government's previous palliative for failing schools - namely, closing a school with a poor reputation to reopen it with a designer name change. The differences are in the funding and governance. Academies are a public/private partnership, with private or voluntary sector sponsors putting in up to \u00a32m of the capital costs and the government stumping up the rest. In return, sponsors are given the right to rename the school and to control the board of governors. As academies are independent of the local education authority (LEA), sponsors are also free to influence the curriculum. Original costings suggested the construction of each academy would have a \u00a310m budget. This has turned out to be a hopelessly optimistic forecast. The City of London Academy in Southwark, south London, came in at \u00a333.7m, and the average capital budget for the 17 academies that will be open by September this year is \u00a325m. With 200 academies in the offing, the new overall budget is \u00a35bn and rising. Many are questioning whether this is the best use of resources. As one LEA officer put it: \"With that much money, you'd expect to be seeing some improvements. The downside is there will be less money for all other schools, so they will suffer in comparison.\" But the overspend spells good news for sponsors. With private money capped at \u00a32m, where originally donors were asked to contribute up to 20% of the capital costs, they are now stumping up only 8% or less. For that, they get all future costs - salaries, overheads, etc - guaranteed by public money in perpetuity. Many fear some donors will regard academies as an easy entrance point to exerting influence over the education system. The Vardy Foundation is an obvious case, but there are question marks over other organisations. Last year, the Church Times reported plans to divert part of the Church Commissioners' Mission Fund into education. \"Schools are today's and tomorrow's future,\" said commissioner Peter Bruinvels. \"It's about front-line evangelism.\" This makes many people distinctly uneasy. \"Religious organisations can now have a say in selecting kids and controlling the religious curriculum,\" says Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society. \"They are free to peddle whatever anti-science they like. They are also in a position to recruit and select teachers who share their views. What's even more disturbing is that the government is actively soliciting partnerships with such organisations.\" The newest faith group on the academy block is the Oasis Trust, which last week announced its sponsorship of the City Academy in Enfield, north London. Steve Chalke, its founding director, is open about his affiliations. \"We are a Christian organisation, and our actions reflect our values,\" he says. \"I try to live by my faith, so, yes, faith does play a part in our involvement. But my faith is based on principles of social equality and inclusion. So the school will be open to anyone of any faith, creed or sexual orientation.\" Concerns have also been raised about the involvement of independent schools, with cynics reckoning they have found a cheap way to protect their charitable status, which has come increasingly under threat. Dulwich College has plans to sponsor an academy in north London; North London Collegiate has expressed interest in an academy in the capital; and 13 other academies are set to receive sponsorship from fee-paying schools or organisations such as Global Management Systems, which fund private education. But at least private schools have experience of education. Some of the other organisations involved have less obvious connections. Absolute Return for Kids, a children's charity set up by city financiers who made it big through hedge fund investments, has registered an expression of interest in sponsoring Islington Green school in north London, but remains something of a mystery, not least because of its refusal to discuss its operations with the media. John Bangs, head of education for the National Union of Teachers, believes in most cases the choice of sponsor may become less relevant. \"All most parents will want to know is that their child is getting a good education,\" he says. \"Providing they can see that is the case, most won't really care about the sponsors' affiliations.\" The experience of Manchester Academy, at the end of its first year, tends to bear this out. \"It doesn't really interest me who sponsors us,\" says headteacher Kathy August. \"The United Learning Trust [a subsidiary charity of the Church Schools Company] makes no demands on the way I run the school. \"Although we have a long way to go, I believe we are heading in the right direction. I have hit all three targets I set myself for the first year: attendance is up by 55%, permanent exclusions are down by 50%, fixed-term exclusions are down by 80%, and a two-day visit by the inspectors gave us a good health check on our teaching and learning.\" Manchester Academy may be slightly atypical. Most academies open in new buildings after a period of closure; Manchester reopened on the same site as the former Ducie high school and will move to new premises in September. This allowed for a continuity other academies have struggled to achieve; every Ducie pupil became part of the new academy and the school has managed to avoid the friction over selection that has dirtied the waters elsewhere. Academies are supposed to be fully comprehensive, apart from the 10% of pupils who can be selected on aptitude under the specialist schools rule. But they have a problem: no matter who you put in charge and what regime you put in place, if you duplicate the intake of the previous failing school, you risk setting yourself up for failure again. Anecdotal evidence reported to the Guardian about selection at a London academy rather confirms this. \"The new academy is keeping to the letter of its policy by selecting on bands [levels of academic ability],\" says one parent. \"But places are going to those at the top of each band. One boy in the middle of the top band was turned down, while others near the top who live far further from the academy got in.\" Selection becomes an even bigger headache when the academies are over-subscribed, as most are. More than 800 pupils applied for 180 places at the City of London Academy, which opens in September. \"This is all about hype,\" says Bangs. \"Parents get to hear a lot about academies, assume they are better than the other schools in the area, and want to send their kids there. This distorts and disrupts the admissions procedures, and is the last thing that is required in areas of deprivation. \"Expectations of the academies will be unreasonably high, while other schools will be left to take those whom the academy rejects.\" The most vitriol for the scheme is focused on the way LEAs have been squeezed out of the process. Bangs believes the consequences are potentially devastating. \"If LEAs have no control over the running of or selection for academies, they can't possibly plan to make adequate education provision across the rest of the sector. Regardless of the spin, the new academies in deprived areas are always likely to be fragile and in need of support. By cutting them off from the LEA, they are denying them access to the best help.\" LEAs are understandably annoyed. \"Local government can only improve education and learning for the entire community if all players work together,\" says a spokesperson for the Local Government Association. \"Moves to strengthen institutional autonomy risk being at the expense of meeting the needs of local communities, undermining collaboration between schools, colleges and employers and hindering the integration of other agencies providing services for children. \"Charles Clarke himself said last week that there is no evidence that city academies are improving performance and admitted they are more expensive.\" Some critics say there appears to be a rush to brand some schools as failing in order to get academy status. Despite a great improvement in exam results, Northcliffe school, near Doncaster, was unexpectedly put in special measures this year. Some locals believe this to be connected with a bid from the Vardy Foundation to turn the school into an academy, and have mounted a campaign. Northcliffe is in a rural area where there are no other schools available. In Hackney, Thomas Abney primary school was also earmarked as a 3-18 academy, despite a good Ofsted report. The proposal failed last week after a vigorous campaign by parents. \"The site was half the recommended area,\" says one campaigner, \"and the final plans were for a building cantilevered over the reservoir, with the play area on the roof. The estimated costs were over \u00a340m for a site that was obviously unsuitable. It was all quite bonkers but the Learning Trust [which runs education services in Hackney] spent over \u00a3200,000 on feasibility studies.\" \"There is a demand for more mixed non-denominational secondary school places in the area,\" says Alan Wood, chief executive of the Learning Trust. \"However, it was not possible to establish a school of that size on the proposed site.\" The list of concerns goes on. Teaching unions fear that new staff will be forced into revised terms and conditions, and the implementation of the workload agreement looks increasingly fragile. But like it or not - and there are rumours Charles Clarke is not himself an out-and-out enthusiast - the academy programme will be rolled out. And as Bangs points out: \"Some academies will probably do very well, while others will fail.\" What part their success or failure may owe to their semi-independent status is anyone's guess. Like so much else in government these days, academies are an article of faith.
