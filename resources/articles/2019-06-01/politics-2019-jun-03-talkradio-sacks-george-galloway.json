The north London club, which has a strong association with the Jewish community, had called for him to be sacked, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s astounding in this day and age to read such blatant antisemitism published on a social platform by someone who is still afforded air time on a radio station on which he has previously broken broadcast impartiality rules.\u201d The former Labour and Respect party MP had presented the Friday night programme, called The Mother of All Talk Shows, since 2016. Earlier this year, the station was censured by the media regulator Ofcom for breaching broadcasting impartiality rules when Galloway cast doubt on Russian involvement in the poisoning of Yulia and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury last year. A spokesperson for the station confirmed it had taken Galloway off air following his tweet, which was posted after the game finished on Saturday night. They said: \u201cTalkRadio has terminated George Galloway\u2019s weekly show with immediate effect. As a fair and balanced news provider, TalkRadio does not tolerate antisemitic views.\u201d Since Galloway\u2019s departure from parliament in 2015 and a disastrous campaign in the 2016 mayor of London race, he has increasingly concentrated on media work. This resulted in the unusual relationship between Galloway and TalkRadio, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK. The station\u2019s studios recently moved into the main News UK office in London Bridge, sharing a building with the Sun and the Times \u2013 outlets that Galloway has often attacked for political reasons. Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, called Galloway a \u201cpoisonous and divisive figure\u201d and said her organisation welcomed the decision to take him off air. \u201cHis attempt to bring hatred into a wonderful occasion for English football has attracted the derision it deserves,\u201d she said. The Labour deputy leader and shadow media minister, Tom Watson, said he welcomed the decision: \u201cWe must stand together against bigotry and in solidarity with the Jewish community. I welcome the decision to take a voice that thrives on division off the air.\u201d Galloway, a longstanding anti-EU campaigner who endorsed Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party in the EU elections, appears to have no intention of going quietly. He has agreed to appear on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain to discuss his suspension and responded to news of his sacking by threatening the station with legal action: \u201cSee you in court guys \u2026 Long live Palestine.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
