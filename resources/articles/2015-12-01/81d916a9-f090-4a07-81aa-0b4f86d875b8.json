It\u2019ll be hard to top last week \u2013 Jeremy and Hans\u2019s artistic-rights feud, Mark\u2019s post-toilet-sex smugness, the ball-burial of Sophie, snakes in the soft-play centre. Of course, Rachel Blanchard, who used to play Jeremy\u2019s girlfriend Nancy, went on to be in Snakes on a Plane; I wonder if that was the inspiration. Anyway, that was ages ago, in Jez\u2019s straight youth. Now he\u2019s turning 40 and finding it hard to keep up with boyfriend Joe\u2019s three-day drug binges. Drinking his own wee doesn\u2019t seem to be helping. I imagine there\u2019s quite a high drug content in the wee \u2013 that\u2019s probably why he can\u2019t sleep. His reference book \u2013 The Golden Fountain: The Complete Guide to Urine Therapy by Coen van der Kroon \u2013 is actually real. Amazon would do well to stock up, since there\u2019s sure to be sudden interest \u2013 the ideal Christmas present idea for the Peep Show fanatic. Bloody hell, it\u2019s expensive if you want a new one. Mark is sacked, replaced by Jeff! I would rather have seen the return of Nancy, to be honest, with or without snakes (maybe with, thinking about it). We\u2019ve already had welcome farewell returns from Dobby and Sophie this series. It\u2019s Jez\u2019s fault, obviously, that Mark was sacked, for which he gets hit \u2013 ouch, a point-of-view punch in the mouth, nice touch. Did they miss a trick by not doing a point-of-view sip of \u201cthe original vaccine, the watery battery, the mellow yellow\u201d for extra grossness? Possibly. The camera operator probably wasn\u2019t keen. On to the big storyline of this one, which is the kidnapping of Angus. Ha, good \u2013 I hate Angus. It means Mark can have a coffee with April and tell her how he really feels. He even uses the L word, the love one. Also, after catching himself saying something his father would have said, he delivers my favourite line of the evening, to himself: \u201cHello, Dad, you\u2019re living inside me now, are you?\u201d Every bloke of a certain age has done it, no, caught himself turning into his father? It\u2019s one of the brilliant things about Peep Show \u2013 not just piss and handjobs, depravity, excruciating hilarity, but also the occasional human truth, a POV peep inside the head of the male psyche. And this is a lovely finale (if lovely can ever be the word to use about anything that contains Mark and Jeremy) of a wonderful final series. It\u2019s absolutely the right decision to stop now, though, at the top, ensuring that Peep Show goes down in TV history, an era-defining sitcom. Mark has his horrid way with April in another toilet. Hang on \u2013 he\u2019s got the girl, they\u2019re off together on the cruise, in to the sunset ... is this all going to end happily ever after? Don\u2019t be daft. The plan goes wrong \u2013 everything goes wrong. Angus escapes and gets April back; Joe leaves Jeremy, for lying about his age; Molly leaves Super Hans, who decides it\u2019s time to van it to Macedonia and finally set up the moped rental. (That has got to be worth a spin-off hasn\u2019t it? I know I\u2019d watch it, Super Hans in the Balkans.) All of which leaves the El Dude brothers pretty much as they started, all those years ago, with only each other. Jez asks Mark to pull him off, although only half-heartedly, to be fair. Mark declines; he wants Jeremy out. The wolf on the telly howls, aaaooow, the end. They\u2019ll carry on, as before, even if we\u2019re not peeping any more. *** Love You to Death: A Year of Domestic Violence (BBC2) takes on extra poignancy, coming in a week of news that police forces in England and Wales are being overwhelmed by a staggering rise in domestic violence cases. Vanessa Engle\u2019s numbing film looks at one year, taking a roll call of the 86 women killed by their partners or former partners. A few of these women \u2013 Kirsty Humphrey (aged 23), Anne-Marie Birch (47), Amina Bibi (43), Chantelle Barnsdale-Quean (35), Joanna Hall (35), Assia Newton (44), Chloe Siokos (80) \u2013 get more than a name: they get their story told, by their families, parents, children, neighbours. Individual human tragedies picked from a shocking statistic. It\u2019s not just the ages of the victims that vary so. There are completely different circumstances, motives, jealousy, cruelty, psychosis, so-called \u201chonour\u201d. But, at the heart of them all, it\u2019s the same old story \u2013 women being killed by men."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
