I was drinking a shandy, a lukewarm mocktail of beer and lemonade that proclaimed to the world, \u201cHere is a man\u2019s man \u2013 a man who drinks what he wants and doesn\u2019t care what you think about his beverage choices.\u201d What I really wanted was a straight lemonade. I also wanted the girl who sat opposite me. I had tried not to talk to her about Dungeons and Dragons, my impressive sci-fi and fantasy collection, or my fascination with cricket statistics, all with moderate success. Putting in all stops, I had even cleaned my glasses, wiped some of the more obvious stains from the blue trench-coat I habitually wore, and shampooed my mullet. I was trying very hard not to be me. But that was OK, because the girl said I looked (a bit) like Judd Nelson. And Judd Nelson was cool. Scratch that \u2013 Judd Nelson had transcended cool and ascended to some nirvana of effortless hipness that I could never possibly hope to attain. Nelson had recently starred in The Breakfast Club, a film that I thought was very, very cool. Nelson\u2019s John Bender \u2013 the whip-smart, wise-cracking, foul-mouthed, substance-abusing, self-loathing misogynist \u2013 was the James Dean of the Madonna generation. His defiant \u201ceat my shorts\u201d was later appropriated by wannabe bad-boy, Bart Simpson, and he was the inspiration behind Futurama\u2019s Bender \u2013 a whip-smart, wise-cracking, foul-mouthed, substance-abusing, self-loathing misogynist 31st-century robot. The Breakfast Club was written, directed and produced by John Hughes, the man who made coming-of-age films come of age. Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink and Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off make a pretty impressive back-catalogue, but The Breakfast Club is still regarded by film critics as the cherry on Hughes\u2019s teen cheesecake. The Breakfast Club turns 30 this week and I now look like the guy who ate Judd Nelson. I still have the glasses but couldn\u2019t grow a mullet, even if I wanted to, except on my back. I have a wife, two children and a quality German sound system. I don\u2019t have a mortgage and my subscription to Green Left Weekly has long since expired. In short, I am the realisation of the greatest fear of The Breakfast Club\u2019s five teenage protagonists. I have become my parents. The Club\u2019s hauntingly scatty Allison, played by Ally Sheedy and her fringe, explains this transition \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s unavoidable. It just happens. When you grow up, your heart dies.\u201d Perhaps it is my lack of heart that has left me feeling more nonplussed than nostalgic by this week\u2019s celebratory re-watch of the iconic 1985 film. So let me go all Tin Man on the plot. Five very different kids, struggling to define themselves against the stereotypes projected onto them by parents and peers, spend Saturday detention (the eponymous Breakfast Club) together in the school library. Eight hours later, after fights, tears, confessions, a couple of funny cigarettes and a still awesome dance scene, the kids accept themselves and each other. Cue closing monologue. Roll credits. Well, sorry Jim Jones, I\u2019m not drinking the Kool-Aid. My four decades old self no longer identifies with teen angst. I have ceased wearing black as a mirror for my ennui. I\u2019ve put my Sylvia Plath collection in the oven and turned up the gas. I only listen to The Smiths when I\u2019m drunk. I now accept that Morrissey is, and always was, a whinger. This is not to say that The Breakfast Club is not a good film. It undeniably is, as evidenced by the cheers of the hipsters who recently attended a special anniversary screening at Bondi Beach. Although the screening was accompanied by a DJ who \u201cplays a mix of feel good nu-disco, boogie, 90s R\u2019n\u2019B and house\u201d, so maybe they were missing the point. Many of the film\u2019s themes still resonate strongly. I searched for self in the difficult years between childhood and grumpy old fart-hood. I\u2019ve tried hard, way too hard, to be somebody else\u2019s idea of cool. I completely get the helicopter parent thing, as I live in a society that has taken it to a whole new Black Hawk Down level. What I don\u2019t get is the film\u2019s fundamental conceit of eight-hour revelation. It\u2019s too contrived. It\u2019s too glib. It\u2019s too goddam easy, even in this age of 10-minute pizza delivery and instant online gratification. And why did Sheedy\u2019s gorgeous proto-Goth get all Stepford Wife on Emilio Estevez\u2019s jock ass at the end of the film? Seriously? Despite this, Hughes\u2019s dialogue still justifies the price of admission. When Allison asks Claire (Molly Ringwald), \u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d Claire replies, \u201cBecause you\u2019re letting me.\u201d Take that, Mean Girls, they are four words of pure coming-of-age gold. The performances of Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall, as brainy Brian, are, at times, heartbreaking. Estevez displays a never before or since replicated sensitivity. As a teen, I derided Ringwald as a Botticelli gopher in pink cashmere, while secretly wishing she would be my Botticelli gopher. As an adult, I think she steals the show. And Nelson? The Bender I aspired to be? He was a one-dimensional, self-indulgent, gratuitously offensive, sexist douchebag. That\u2019s really what hurt the most about revisiting my childhood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
