Dadge was a central component of one of the most moving images of the 7 July bombings in 2005, pictured ushering Davinia Douglass away from Edgware Road tube station as she clutched a surgical mask to her face. Initially, possibly naively, the former firefighter indulged a media desperate for personalities who could symbolise the suffering of the attacks. The tabloid press nominated him a hero of 7/7. Within a day of the bombings Dadge had handed his mobile phone number to at least 35 reporters. Despite operating an unusually open policy when dealing with the media \u2013 he would rarely refuse to take calls from journalists on even the most random of queries \u2013 Dadge learned in 2011 that he had been repeatedly hacked by the News of the World. \"I felt very disappointed that the journalist chose to do that as opposed to ringing and asking me. I'd lost control of what I wanted to release once it became obvious that my phone had been hacked \u2013 that's sad,\" said Dadge, who runs an IT company and also chairs a volunteer ambulance scheme. Dadge spent much of last week scrutinising the coverage that followed Tuesday's unanimous jury verdict leaving Andy Coulson facing jail after being found guilty of conspiring to hack phones while editor of the News of the World. He noted how a number of national newspapers opted to angle their analysis away from the plight of David Cameron's former communications chief. Rather than concentrate on Coulson's guilty verdict, much of the coverage, and not just in the Murdoch-owned titles, focused on the fact that his predecessor in the job, Rebekah Brooks, walked free from the Old Bailey after being cleared of all charges. More conspicuous yet to those who, like Dadge, have suffered at the hands of the hackers was an egregious lack of focus on the victims \u2013 Scotland Yard believes as many as 5,500 might have been targeted. Dadge is among those unimpressed at much of the media's decision to concentrate on Brooks while the invasion of privacy and the need for stronger press regulation articulated by Gemma Dowler, sister of the murdered schoolgirl Milly, received considerably fewer headlines. He accepts that the intrinsic nature of news means that the reports accompanying the conclusion of the eight-month trial have refocused calls for a more robust method of press regulation in the wake of the Leveson inquiry. Coulson's guilty verdict, he said, has restoked the victims' belief that the press cannot be trusted. \"On one level the verdict has given us more airtime, paper-time, but the fact is that what we're asking for is still not being delivered even when people are being found guilty.\" Despite the criminal behaviour he endured at the hands of the News of the World, Dadge says he understands the sometimes unreasonable demands tabloid titles can place on their reporters. \"I do have sympathy because of the pressure they are under from editors like Rebekah Brooks to deliver. One particular journalist said she would lose her job unless she delivered on a story about Davinia.\" Dadge also chooses not to take the fact he was targeted personally, believing that hacking was carried out on such an industrial scale that it became de rigueur for reporters to check messages on any individual they happened to be writing about. \"People weren't targeted \u2013 I believe it was almost a matter of course for phones to be checked. It's fairly damn obvious that it wasn't just the News of the World. How could other newspapers sit there and watch all these scoops and have nothing to say about it?\" In fact Dadge, 37, from Cannock, West Midlands, suspects that those who accessed his phone were hoping to stumble across messages containing contact details for Douglass, whose attempts to protect her privacy ensured she became a source of obsession for some newspapers. He is acutely aware of how toxic the subject has become for the British media. For years after 7 July he would field all manner of queries, on all subjects terror-related. But the moment he joined the campaign group which represents the victims of press abuse, Hacked Off, in November 2011, such requests stopped overnight. \"Newspapers don't want to publicise the issue. They're businesses.\" However, Dadge, who married in 2009 and has two young children, is keen not to be labelled a victim, preferring to be described as someone who finds the practice of hacking utterly unacceptable. \"Maybe I'm quite a laidback person but I'd be lying if I said I felt pain and angst over being hacked. In some ways, joining Hacked Off has actually left me energised. I've met the leaders of all three parties and it's given me a purpose and an interest in politics, which we'll see where it leads.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
