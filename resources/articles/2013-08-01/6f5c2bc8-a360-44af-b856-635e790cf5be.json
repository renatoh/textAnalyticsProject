Charlotte Knobloch, president of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, said the visit was a \"very strong and important symbol\". \"There are several concentration camps, like Auschwitz, abroad, and for decades chancellors and German presidents have been travelling to these places of horrible German crimes and taking historical responsibility,\" she said. \"But the fact that she's visiting a location within Germany where these unimaginable crimes took place, that doesn't happen so often \u2026 it shows her determination and will to learn the right lessons from history.\" Dachau concentration camp first opened on March 22, 1933, just weeks after Adolf Hitler became chancellor, as a camp for political prisoners. It was situated close to Munich on the site of a derelict first world war munitions factory and served as a model for later concentration camps, that were placed all over Europe. More than 200,000 prisoners were interned at the camp before it was liberated in 1945 by American troops. But while Merkel has received praise from the Jewish community, the Green party parliamentary leader, Renate K\u00fcnast, criticised her for deciding to visit the camp during the election campaign and before an election rally to be held a beer tent, calling it \"tasteless\". \"If you are serious about commemorating such a place of horror, you would definitely not make such a visit during an election campaign,\" K\u00fcnast told the German newspaper, Leipziger Volkszeitung. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2013.
