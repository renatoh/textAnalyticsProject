Kelly, who is legally blind, and Jones came from behind during the swimming leg of the event before powering home in the final run. The pair beat British combination Alison Patrick and Melissa Reid, who had to settle for silver, in a time of one hour, 12 minutes and 18 seconds over the three legs at Copacabana beach \u2013 constituting a 750m swim, 22.28km of cycling and a 5km run. \u201cI was saying to Michellie that it\u2019s something that you wish for, but these triathlon competitions I never take it for granted and it\u2019s hard work out there. You can\u2019t underestimate how hard it is to get there,\u201d Kelly told APC Media. \u201cSo when Michellie said, \u2018KK, we\u2019re going to get on that blue carpet [finish line] \u2013 you can enjoy it,\u2019 I thought \u2018No, I\u2019m going to get to the finish line first\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m just really honoured and chuffed, and to do that in para-triathlon here in Rio is a really special moment.\u201d Jones, 47, won silver in the women\u2019s triathlon at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, but said Sunday\u2019s achievement outweighed any other during her career. \u201cThis is so much better because when I think of everything KK has been through and to be able of doing everything she\u2019s done in such short amount of time,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me this is the best thing that I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d Meanwhile, Kurt Fearnley could not match his gold medal-winning performance of 2004 in the 5,000m T54 \u2013 or the silver medal he won in London four years ago \u2013 but still picked up bronze behind winner Prawat Wahoram of Thailand and Switzerland\u2019s Marcel Hug. Fearnley star remains a good chance for gold in the marathon \u2013 which he has won twice before \u2013 while he will also compete in the T53/54 1,500m and 4x400m. Another Australian medal arrived courtesy of Angie Ballard, who claimed her second of these Games with another bronze in the women\u2019s T53 400m, while rower Erik Horrie won silver in the men\u2019s single sculls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
