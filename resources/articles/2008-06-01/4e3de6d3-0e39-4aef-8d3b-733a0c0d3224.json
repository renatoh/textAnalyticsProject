Burns' career has been a slow build, but even if 21st-century music isn't exactly crying out for another standards singer, the Krall/Stacey Kent marketplace might well have room for such a startlingly classy exponent of the art. Taylor's bursts of fizzing double-time out of the chunky swing feel under He's a Tramp certainly banishes any low-lights languor, and on such much-travelled classics as Sophisticated Lady, Burns (an embellisher rather than full-on improviser) confirms her pedigree with the lightest of touches - imperceptibly hurrying a word here, turning another into a soft hoot, stretching a sound into a whispered glissando. Her poignant ballad on the brother who died in the Falklands War won't leave a dry eye in the house, and a slow account of Stevie Wonder's If It's Magic eerily catches Stevie's soulful tremor without turning up the volume a notch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
