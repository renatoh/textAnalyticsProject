Ollie Magern is entitled to start favourite after heroic efforts in hot handicaps, but it is just possible those efforts have taken the edge off the six-year-old, whose trainer, Nigel Twiston-Davies, has a poor record in this race. It can pay to oppose Ollie Magern with Control Man (1.00). A tough hurdler, Martin Pipe's gelding looks set to be even better over fences. His task at Cheltenham last time was simplified by the fall of El Vaquero four out, but Control Man came home in great style and can grind out another victory. Harchibald (1.35) will be at cramped odds in the Stan James Christmas Hurdle, but it is difficult to oppose Noel Meade's vastly improved performer over a course where his turn of foot will be a potent weapon. With Rooster Booster, runner-up here last year, probably on the downgrade, the unbeaten novice Arcalis will have his supporters. However, his more experienced stable companion Inglis Drever was made to look ordinary by Harchibald at Newcastle, and the latter's equally smooth defeat of Back In Front at Punchestown was also high-class form. Duncliffe (2.45), another promising recruit from the point-to-point ranks for Robert Alner, looks worth following after an improved round of jumping saw him win decisively at Taunton. Channel 4 cameras are also at Wetherby, where the Rowland Meyrick Chase is the highlight. For a horse having his second start over fences, Howard Johnson's Lord Transcend (1.15) ran a remarakable race to finish fourth in the Hennessy at Newbury. He races off the same mark here and can only improve. Sunday's best bet is Bambi De L'Orme (2.15) at Wincanton. He ran into an above average chaser in Oneway at Haydock, but finished clear of the rest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
