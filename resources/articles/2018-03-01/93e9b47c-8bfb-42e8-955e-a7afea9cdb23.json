In its latest interim forecasts, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it expected the world economy to expand by 3.9% in both 2018 and 2019 \u2013 a 0.3 percentage point upgrade in each year from its last set of predictions last November. The OECD said investment, trade and employment were all playing a part in a broad-based expansion that has prompted growth upgrades for six of the seven G7 countries. US tax cuts, announced by Trump since the OECD\u2019s November forecasts, were one reason why the growth outlook was stronger than it was four months ago, the thinktank said. \u201cGrowth is steady or improving in most G20 countries and the expansion is continuing,\u201d said OECD acting chief economist Alvaro Pereira. Pereira added that Trump\u2019s recently announced tariffs \u2013 25% on imported steel and 10% on imported aluminium \u2013 had left the global economy vulnerable to a tit-for-tat trade war. \u201cThis could obviously threaten the recovery. Certainly we believe this is a significant risk, so we hope that it doesn\u2019t materialise because it would be fairly damaging,\u201d Pereira said. Pereira said the imposition of tariffs by the White House was the wrong way of dealing with the global problem of excess steel production and called for Trump to seek a collective solution through the OECD. \u201cSafeguarding the rules-based international trading system is key,\u201d he added. The boost to demand provided by Trump\u2019s tax cuts has meant that the OECD has revised up its forecast for US growth by 0.4 points to 2.9% in 2018 and by 0.7 points to 2.8% in 2019. However, it believes faster growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy will result in four increases in interest rates from the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, this year. The OECD also revised up its forecasts for Germany and France, but remained gloomy about the prospects for Britain as it approaches the date for Brexit in March 2019. Tax cuts included in the deal that has pieced together a coalition government in Germany were seen as lifting growth in the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy to 2.4% this year, up 0.1 points on November, and to 2.2% in 2019 (up by 0.3 points). Emmanuel Macron\u2019s social welfare, tax and labour market reforms would help France narrow the gap with Germany, the thinktank said, with growth forecast at an 11-year high of 2.2% before easing to 1.9% in 2019. French growth has been revised up by 0.4 points in 2018 and by 0.2 points in 2019. For the eurozone as a whole, growth is put at 2.3% this year and 2.1% in 2019, a 0.2 point upgrade in each year. The thinktank believes the UK economy will expand by 1.3% this year, up from 1.2% in November, and by an unchanged 1.1% in 2019."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
