There never seemed to be a huge gap between us; there wasn't that inter-generational distance that many parents and children struggled with. When I was a teenager, they were only 20 years older than me and were still into rock'n'roll too. It made it easier for us to be friends. They were also very open-hearted and forward-looking, not old-fashioned at all. There wasn't a time when we weren't close. My dad was a non-conformist, and I must have absorbed some of that along the way. We lived in Erdington, Birmingham with my maternal grandparents until I was seven. It probably felt cramped for the adults, but as a child it was lovely having so many people around. It was a happy, safe place. My grandmother, Agnes, was picture perfect. One of these jolly, roly-poly ladies who cooks and hugs. It gave me the best childhood. I was fascinated by my grandfather. He was a gunsmith. He made bespoke guns at a time when Birmingham was the centre of the trade. His shed was always out of bounds, but there was a hole in the door I would peep through and watch him at work. It was such a beautiful thing to see. Like many of his generation, Grandad was a man of few words, but they were often funny ones. I remember my dad driving us somewhere and pointing out, \"We've just passed the oldest pub in England,\" to which my grandad replied, \"Why?\" My grandad was named Simon, but hated it so was always known as Fred. The story goes that when he married my grandmother they had to have a second ceremony because he didn't think to use his real name the first time. I was an only child until I was seven. When my brother Jem came along, I wasn't jealous at all, just very excited. For a start, he was so incredibly cute. We are still best friends. When you reach adolescence, you think you have something to teach your parents. But you haven't. It takes a while to realise that, and to understand how much they have taught you. I absorbed my parents' values, especially, I hope, their integrity, truthfulness and sense of spiritual quest [he has three children, Luke, Joe and Sophie]. We all shared the same spiritual path later in life, and that is quite unusual. When I told my father I'd found a way to live [the eastern philosophy Sant Mat], it was the quietest I have ever known him. He sat and listened for three hours then said, \"That's what I've been looking for all my life,\" and he and my mum took the same path. When I look at old pictures of my parents I can't believe they are gone. It doesn't seem real that they aren't here any more. It seems like only yesterday we were all talking, but that's life isn't it? My father had a good death. He was in his 80s when he passed away peacefully in his chair, with a cup of tea and a box of caramels at his side. I think we would all like that. It is a great sadness that my dad didn't get to see the great-grandchild who was named after him. He died just a couple of weeks before his birth. My son rang me and said: \"You've got a grandson and his name is Frank.\" It was one of those \"gulp\" moments. \u2022 Martin Shaw stars in a new series of Inspector George Gently on BBC1, from 26 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
