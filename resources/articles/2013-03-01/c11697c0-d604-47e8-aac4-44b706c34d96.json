It ended with all of the town lights turned off and a killer purportedly on the loose amid the visiting crowds and noise of fireworks and marauding fun-starved locals dressed as Vikings, though, frankly, by that point the village idiot (I'm not suggesting Shetland has one) could have guessed who shot the old woman in the first scene and murdered the young woman at the halfway point to keep her quiet and the rest of us mildly intrigued. It was fashionably bleak, with its raw weather, large, unglamorous jumpers and soundtrack alternating between seagulls and the wail of Celtic instruments, but lacked the fibre and grain to satisfy those accustomed to the wilder exotic feasts of BBC4's crime roster. Despite efforts to invest local DI Jimmy Perez with a little zing \u2013 tangled parental status, presumed Hispanic ancestry (a tricky illusion for pale Scots gingernut Douglas Henshall to pull off) \u2013 its dramatic heart was nearer to Bergerac than Wallander. (How much this adaptation strays from Ann Cleeves's novels I couldn't say.) It had a remarkably small unpleasantness quota. I don't know if the director couldn't stand the sight of blood, but one character emerged from a three-thug battering in the alley with the merest scratch on his nose. \"You must have some idea who did this to you,\" demanded Jimmy with a straight face. I have to ask, too \u2013 does Shetland really only have four police officers? With one stuck answering the phone, another off the case on account of being related to all the suspects and the third a dozy newbie garbling her lines through comedic dental braces, Jimmy had his work cut out just keeping up with the endless mugs of tea Scottish detectives are expected to drink. \"Ach, Jimmy, everything changes,\" his friend said at one point, in a way that made you wonder what it was like before. It was comfortably watchable. The acting was sound. The story, involving generations of feuding aunts, uncles, cousins and ne'er-do-wells of two families, reached interestingly into Shetland's wartime past and the fishing boats that ran night-time missions to Norway under the noses of the Germans. But whose was the skull dug up by archaeologists outside the dead woman's farmhouse? A double agent? An early hovel-dweller? My own question \u2013 why were they digging there anyway, in the middle of nowhere and yet weirdly right on someone's doorstep \u2013 went unanswered. Instead came the usual winnowing of alibis and lengthy fathoming of who stood to gain from this or that. An oleaginous professor was required to muddy the waters by sleeping with half the cast. Did being unable to get a decent mobile signal in Shetland have any bearing on events? It did not, though you could imagine it getting annoying after a while. In the end, Jimmy just had to stand there while people pelted him with clues, not least the killer, who in a moment not seen since the high days of Perry Mason blurted out the detail of evidence only the police were supposed to know about. I'm still shaking my head at that. The surprise hit of the week was Toughest Place to Be a\u2026 Taxi Driver, which dropped likable London cabbie Mason McQueen into the fiery pit of hell that is the Mumbai traffic system. He was full of talk at home but his first 100 words here were all \"Whoa!\", as his mentor, Pradeep (one of the city's 60,000 taxi drivers) demonstrated how to slalom across town without indicators or brakes. Use of the horn was acceptable. As Mason put it, once he'd got his eyes back in his head: \"It's like Mad Max meets The Kumars.\" It was perilous but hilarious. Mason's official instructor advised: \"Take care not to knock over human beings, but importantly not cows.\" Pradeep differed only in emphasis. \"God forbid, if you injure anyone, the public will give you a beating.\" No pressure then. Mason on his own was a picture of anxiety, hunched sweating over the wheel as he inched around looking for business among the hustling crowds of cheaper autorickshaws. \"Fucking pests,\" he muttered. But it was the living conditions that illuminated the wonder in him and gave the programme its emotional force \u2013 Pradeep in two rooms with his wife, mother, sister-in-law and six children; a single-parent family huddled under a bridge; Mason's cheerful taxi-driver colleagues \u2013 despised migrants from the north \u2013 sleeping 20 to a tin-roofed shack. Mason, as guileless as he was adaptable, bonded with everyone, saw his suffering in the light of those who braved it daily and turned what could have been a routine reality show into something valuable and transforming. \"It's nice to see a bit of hope in people's faces who've got nothing. It's not all despair and traffic,\" he said. Partial though I'm not to the word \"quirky\", Channel 4's new midweek sitcom, The Mimic, made a special plea for it, perhaps along with \"gentle\" and also, at times, \"funny\". Here was Martin Hurdle (Terry Mynott), a man with a dull job amusing himself by doing impressions. Wogan and Ronnie Corbett have become too standardised to impress but you had to laugh at his Al Pacino and his James Earl Jones quibbling with Morgan Freeman. The show didn't entirely depend on mimicry and there was strong support from Jo Hartley as his live-in friend Jean and Neil Maskell (arch psychopath from Utopia) turned up as a compellingly neurotic newsagent. The first episode found an anxious Martin meeting up with an old flame's 18-year-old son for a burger followed by a DNA test. \"If I'm not your dad, we can still be friends,\" he said. It was droll but unexpectedly touching. When it came back positive, I almost had to stop eating my biscuit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
