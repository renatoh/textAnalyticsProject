Stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman returned for the third series on Wednesday promising answers to the puzzle that has confounded the show's 10 million viewers for the last two years (if you have not seen the opening episode and do not want to know, stop reading now). But by the end of the long-anticipated return they were still wondering, with no clear answer as to how exactly he managed to topple off the roof of St Bart's Hospital in London's Smithfield and live to solve another clue. An exhilarating opening sequence, featuring Holmes, played by Cumberbatch, smashing through a window on a bungee rope and Watson (Freeman) distracted by Derren Brown, proved a red herring, as did a subsequent explanation involving a giant inflatable landing pad and a secret plan called Lazarus. In fact, the supersleuth revealed, there were 13 possible ways in which he could have faked his own death \u2013 he only explained two of them \u2013 but viewers were left none the wiser as to which saved his skin. It was not the only surprise in Wednesday's episode, with a cameo appearance by Holmes's parents played by Cumberbatch's real-life mother and father, actors Timothy Carlton and Wanda Ventham. The show was full of references to the show's enormous fan following in the UK, US and around the world, and fervent speculation about Holmes's fall and exactly how intimate the relationship is between the two lead characters. Playful and at times even slapstick, the latest episode was greeted with whoops and cheers at a preview screening last month but may prove a little too much for more purist fans of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories. Mark Gatiss, who co-created Sherlock with Steven Moffat and wrote the latest episode, told the preview audience: \"It felt like the right thing to do at the start of the third season to be even cheekier.\" Moffat said it was when \"all the stories were starting to kick off\" about how Holmes survived that they thought they would \"make up a bananas one\". Gatiss said the introduction of Holmes's parents was \"the first time we have gone beyond \u2026 I don't know if Sherlock's parents have ever been shown before\". Gatiss said Sherlock and his brother, Mycroft, were \"like Niles and Frasier Crane. They have very nice parents who are ordinary people. They are more likely to be the product of a loving home than a broken one\". Cumberbatch said he \"nearly cried\" watching his parents on screen. \"I am so proud of them,\" he said. \"I think they are perfect casting as my parents. It was kind of nerve-wracking \u2013 they are Equity card-carrying members \u2013 they were brilliant, they hit home runs, they were fantastic. It was really nice to have them on set.\" After a first half dominated by the great detective's return and Watson's struggle to grasp his friend's survival, the episode returned to more familiar territory with an underground plot \u2013 in the very literal sense \u2013 to blow up parliament, with Watson almost the victim of a hideous Bonfire night attack. With Moriarty, unlike Sherlock, very definitely dead at the end of the second series, a new, sinister-looking villain was revealed at the end, with two episodes to come in this run and another cliffhanger promised for the finale. The show is expected to be watched by more than 10 million people and is favourite to be the most watched show of the holiday period. The next two episodes will air on BBC1 on Sunday 5 January, and the following Sunday 12 January. The show also featured the debut of Freeman's real-life partner, Amanda Abbington, as Watson's love interest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
