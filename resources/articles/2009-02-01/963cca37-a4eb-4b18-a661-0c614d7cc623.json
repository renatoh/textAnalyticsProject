He thinks it's a bit, well, rich in times like these: The Conservatives claim that they are \"thanking members of the community\" but the guest list reads more like Burke's Peerage. If the Conservatives want to entertain their friends then they should use their own money and not ours. The price of civic dinners isn't my field of expertise, but I'm inclined to sympathise. Value for money? I mean, look at the menu: Roasted Pepper Pannacotta Loin of Beef White Chocolate Mousse Cheese and Biscuits Guests will drink a Sauvignon and a Merlot. What, no ice cream? And what's wrong with a nice bit of cake? How about bits of cake like these ones made in Woolwich, which I know about thanks to this tweeter. How about I get one for my birthday on Sunday? How about I shut up about food? How about I just...? Fellow Londoners: enjoy your food this weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
