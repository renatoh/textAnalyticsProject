An initial legal assessment of last week\u2019s 856-page report by Sir Martin Moore-Bick into the 2017 blaze has concluded that the prospect of individual or corporate prosecutions is now far more likely. Paul Ridge, a partner at Bindmans, which represents 200 bereaved relatives and survivors of the fire that killed 72 people, said Moore-Bick\u2019s finding that Grenfell\u2019s facade was \u201cnot compliant with building regulations\u201d was a game-changer. Ridge said: \u201cHe\u2019s saying that the building is effectively unlawful. Immediately the spotlight has been turned on to the designers, the constructors and the materials. The only question now is who was responsible. The chances of criminal prosecutions have increased significantly.\u201d The legal team was also encouraged by Moore-Bick\u2019s use of the report to criticise companies linked with a refurbishment of the tower a year before the fire. Arconic, the US firm that made the Grenfell cladding, had urged the inquiry to wait to decide if the tower broke building regulations. However, Moore-Bick dismissed the firm\u2019s requests and revealed it had not even offered a \u201creasoned argument\u201d for how the facade might comply with building regulations. He added: \u201cIt is clear that the walls [of the tower] didn\u2019t resist the spread of fire. On the contrary, they promoted it.\u201d The report also criticised the home-appliance firm Whirlpool, whose faulty fridge-freezer led to the inferno, but whose assertion that the fire was started by a cigarette was dismissed as \u201cfanciful\u201d by Moore-Bick. The second phase of the inquiry will largely focus on the chain of events and decision-making leading up to the refurbishment, which added the tower\u2019s flammable cladding in 2016, and the corporate testing regime that allowed Grenfell to be wrapped in such materials. Towards the end of his report, Moore-Bick states he will investigate the \u201cregime for testing materials intended for use in external walls and [whether] the regulations governing their use were, and are, adequate to identify and control the potential dangers\u201d. He also intends to investigate the corporate construction trade and its relationship with government officials and what they knew about the risks involved in using highly combustible thermoplastic polymers in the cladding. \u201cI shall also examine what was and should have been known, both by those in the construction industry and by those in central government responsible for setting fire safety standards, about the particular dangers posed by thermoplastic polymers,\u201d he states. Scotland Yard is investigating the fire, but has stated it will not bring any criminal charges until Moore-Bick\u2019s inquiry is complete, which could take another two years at least."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
