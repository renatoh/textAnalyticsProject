His travelogue plaits together strands from the splendid imperial past of jade and silk with the present: countries released from Soviet ideology and now gripped by fundamentalism. He searches out ordinary people everywhere - in Uzbekistan, for instance, herdsmen in yurts ply him with vodka and delicacies from freshly killed sheep - encounters which reveal the conflicts of this ferment of religions, culture and 'progress', like the Afghan woman able to communicate with a man only by a mobile hidden in her burqa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
