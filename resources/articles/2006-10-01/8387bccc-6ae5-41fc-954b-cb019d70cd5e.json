Based on a novel by Scott's friend Peter Mayle, it stars a charmless Russell Crowe as a ruthless, workaholic investment broker. He works, as everyone does in British films nowadays, within a stone's throw of Norman Foster's London Gherkin, and he's the kind of person who lives in a glass house at whom stones should be thrown. He inherits a run-down Provencal chateau and vineyard from a philosophical, Francophile uncle (Albert Finney). The movie poses the question: should he sell it and go back to the rat race or should he settle in France among all these wonderful, life-enhancing people? Or should he have his gateau (or chateau) and eat it? Or can he manage both? The whole Gallic gallimaufry is here, from Jean Sablon singing 'J'attendrai' to the hero's architect chum saying: 'Oo la la!', and the result is less 'Another Year in Provence' than Une saison en enfer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
