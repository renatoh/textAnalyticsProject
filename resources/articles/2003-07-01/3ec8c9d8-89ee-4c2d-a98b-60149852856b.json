Refresh this page again in the next 15 minutes or so and they may finally have returned to plough pointlessly on. In the meantime, feel free to email me stuff [as in sparkling wit and so on, nothing offensive] to the address above. 12.15pm update: Before they return, with bellies full of cucumber triangles, Dan has requested I paste Carol Fullilove's Bakewell tart response. Naturally, I had no problem agreeing to this. \"You're very welcome. . . yes, they are greasy, but, I think, in a good way,\" she writes. \"'Twas ordered on the internet - ironically, I'm in Blackfriars, marginally further away from Bakewell than your good selves - but The Original Bakewell Pudding shop's website affords one the fantastic opportunity of sending a delicious pud/arterty-clogging timebomb anywhere in the country, and indeed, the world, at a very reasonable price. \"Definitely one of my favourite games - sending puddings willy-nilly.\" Erm, quite. 16th over: South Africa 61-2 Dippenaar gets a clearish edge, Stewart appeals loudly, the umpire, whose name I missed, looks unimpressed. Ashley Giles looks bemused quite rightly bemused. Other than that, little else to raise the heart rate. 17th over: South Africa 62-2 A tight spell from James Anderson, Smith turning just a single to square leg. South Africa are now 248 ahead. \"On my way to a game in Dulwich I narrowly missed killing Paul Whitehouse on a pedestrian crossing outside the Islington branch of Sainsbury's,\" writes/brags Michael Harlow. \"The contents of his shopping were part spilled in the incident and I gathered from my driving mirror that that week he was mostly eating poncy north London organic cheeses, which was nice.\" 18th over: South Africa 72-2 Having danced jauntily down the crease, Smith smashes Giles away to extra cover for four, then brings up his 50 with a quick single. \"I played a friendly against a bunch of poxy actors calling themselves 'The Stage' last summer,\" announces Chris, \"and it turns out I hit a six off some bloke called Charlie who's in The Archers. \"Being of sound mind and only 28 at the time, I had no idea who he was then, or is now, indeed, so there. It was a nice six though.\" 19th over: South Africa 72-2 Zilch off the Anderson over, and in truth nothing much to report. Which is not the same as nothing much to report because I was too busy shoving Bakewell tart down my face. Oh no. 20th over: South Africa 95-2 Three successive fours from Smith from Anderson's bowling, plus a shoddy piece of wicketkeeping from Stewart, make for an expensive over. Smith has moved to 72 from 59 balls and has kept the strike. You back from lunch yet? 21st over: South Africa 101-2 The hundred's up, as you can see from the score above. \"What qualifications do you need to watch cricket and cut and paste emails all day long?\" asks Tom Price. \"Where do I apply? I am very good at watching TV all day!\" Sounds like you're perhaps over-qualified, Tom. Try the BBC. 22nd over: South Africa 114-2 Smith bludgeons Flintoff's first ball for a meaty four, then helps himself to a flat six through mid off. He seems to be looking for another quick ton before making any declaration. \"And to think the Americans say they can't understand the appeal of a 5-day test match ending in a draw,\" snorts Andrew Goldsby. \"What's wrong with them? This is... is.... er... exceedingly tedious isn't it?\" Indeed it is, Andrew, though probably far more so for you than me. WICKET Smith b Giles 85 (South Africa 114-3) Smith finally falls for 85, going for another big hit but beaten by the flight on Giles's first ball, which spins through the gate and clatters his middle stump. 24th over: South Africa 128-3 Jacques Rudolph is the new man in, and watches Dippenaar sweep Giles for four through deep backward square leg. Anton Lawrence wonders how many they'll get before they declare, and he's not the only one. Neil of Swindon has a more pressing question, however. \"Is it possible that the lard or any of the other lovely ingredients in that Bakewell tart can cure my shocking hangover?\" he asks. \"If so, can that person send us one please over to sunny Swindon?\" WICKET Rudolph b Giles s Stewart 8 (South Africa 134-4) And with that smart stumping from Stewart, Graeme Smith finally declares. The lead's 320, with 65 overs remaining for England to pull off an unlikely victory. England's response - 1st over: England 0-0 (chasing 321 to win) Vaughan and Trescothick are leading the run chase for England, though Rory Lawson might have been a better bet. \"I once hit a cricket ball for four,\" he writes, \"and in the process dented the passenger door of Ted 321 Dusty Bin Rogers' tan Rolls Royce. \"Oh, and just to let you know that I love my job... and England should win this test match by nine wickets.\" As you can see, Pollock opens with a very tidy maiden. 2nd over: England 2-0 (chasing 321 to win) Both England openers open their accounts with quick singles. Nick Butler corrects my \"unlikely victory\" line. \"It doesn't seem that impossible and would seem Smith has been quite generous/daring,\" he writes, asking me to revise my opinion. Well, there were certainly plenty of runs in this pitch for the South African skipper, so let's wait and see. 3rd over: England 3-0 (chasing 321 to win) Pollock gives nothing away there, apart from a single to Trescothick of course. The run rate's more than five an over and rising. 4th over: England 8-0 (chasing 321 to win) Trescothick punishes a short Ntini ball outside off by cutting it away to third-man boundary. \"On my way through the crowds heading to the Oval recently, I think I saw Sir Richard Attenborough stop throw his arms wide open, exclaim 'My God, it's been 20 years hasn't it?\" and bear hug a man who I assume was a long lost acquaintance.\" So writes Gavin Hutchinson, who appears to have purposely gone against every rule in the Guardian's style guide. \"It may not have been Attenborough though, because (a) I only saw him from the side (b) er, he's not dead is he? Apologies if he is.\" Not to our knowledge he's not, Gavin, though one of our readers may know better. 4th over: England 9-0 (chasing 321 to win) Vaughan pinches just a single from Pollock, there. Nothing more, nothing less. 5th over: England 29-0 (chasing 321 to win) Five fours from Trescothick, with Ntini playing into his hands by coming round the wicket. Just another 292 to win. \"England 321 to win - Rory Lawson hit Ted '321' Rogers car,\" writes Will Frost. \"I think the cricketing gods are trying to tell us something, but what?\" \"PS I am a temp so though I find my job boring, I have the comfort of knowing it won't last forever.\" Is that meant to make the rest of us feel better, Will? I guess not. 6th over: England 29-0 (chasing 321 to win) Sadly, from an English perspective, Shaun Pollock is not Makhaya Ntini, hence no change on the scoreboard. \"On a different note, isn't it interesting (and other readers/contributors will have noticed this too, I'm sure) how your emailers are usually always the same people,\" writes Shehzad Charania, sniffing a clique. \"I mean, you guys must know Anton Lawrence and Ian Pugh personally by now ...\" On a completely different note, and more interesting than that scandalous untruth, is the breaking/broken news that Bob Hope has died. Just then, sadly. 7th over: England 40-0 (chasing 321 to win) As if to prove that Ntini is not Pollock, Vaughan spanks the South African for a juicy six over square leg, then four more through mid off. Expensive over. While all that was going on, Imran Ahmed was Google searching... \"Sir Richard Attenborough director, actor Born: 8/29/23 Birthplace: Cambridge, England He's still around,\" he confirms. 8th over: England 40-0 (chasing 321 to win) Shaun Pollock. No runs. 9th over: England 44-0 (chasing 321 to win) Robin Peterson replaces Ntini in the South African attack and stems the bleeding. England need another 277 to win, though the bookies think it remote. \"You can currently get 50-1 on England to win this game,\" writes an excited Jonathan McCauley. \"Obviously this is very tempting but not all of your readers will be able to get down the bookies this afternoon. \"As it happens I'm going that way myself later so if everyone sends their stake money to me at The Foundry, 41 Shelton Street, London, I'll put it on for them.\" What a marvellously generous offer, Jonathan, and they say there are no real gents left. My pony's in the post and my fingers crossed. 10th over: England 47-0 (chasing 321 to win) Gremlins wreaked havoc on updating this page. Tried chucking water on them, just made it twice as bad. All I know is the facts, Pollock bowled, England feasted on three more runs. 11th over: England 47-0 (chasing 321 to win) Nice and tidy from Peterson, not to mention efficient. It leaves Trescothick on 35 and Vaughan on 12, with England 274 from victory. 13th over: England 48-0 (chasing 321 to win) One off the Pollock over, as a conspiracy theory drops into my inbox. \"According to a colleague,\" begins Diddly Riddly, \"Bob Hope actually died 15 years ago. He reckons that there has been a conspiracy to keep the 'Hope' alive (sorry but unavoidable!) amongst the US populus, who wouldn't have been able to handle the truth that their American icon was six feet under. \"Has anyone else heard about this?\" Or did he just make it up? 14th over: England 59-0 (chasing 321 to win) Four byes and a Trescothick four through mid off. And sure enough, the cheap shots have started. \"England only had two hopes of wining,\" writes Toby Hiles, \"Bob and No, and now that Bob's gone...\" 15th over: England 62-0 (chasing 321 to win) Three off the bowling of Dewald Pretorius, which is neither here nor there really. \"I tried to break into the cliquey world of Guardian Unlimited once, I even got a couple of emails used. But then I was discarded like the uncool friend no-one really wants to talk to. You probably won't print this one either will you? I don't know why I bother really...\" You said it, Matt Amer. 17th over: England 63-0 (chasing 321 to win) Pretorius to Trescothick, legbye, one run, to square leg. Nothing else, repeat nothing else, to report. If this game was a dog, it would have/should have been shot by now. Under the headline 'Reasons to be Cheerful', Philip Baker writes... \"If you take a stapler and turn the metal bit that the staples push against around, the prongs splay outwards. Well it cheered me up.\" And you alone, surely. 18th over: England 66-0 (chasing 321 to win) Marcus Trescothick adds a little much-needed drama to proceedings by hamming up a dead leg. And that, quite frankly, was all you missed. 19th over: England 66-0 (chasing 321 to win) Peterson to Vaughan, one run, driven past bowler to mid off. Truly soporific. \"Wasn't Bob Hope born in North Shields,\" wonders Austin Lillico, \"or was that Stan Laurel?\" WICKET Vaughan 22, b Peterson c Pollock (72-1) Vaughan goes for a well flighted delivery on the stumps but edges it to first slip, where Pollock is alert enough to take a sharp catch. All that happened several minutes ago, however, as I'm sure you've guessed. More gremlins in the machine to blame. You've not missed anything though, for tea was declared as Vaughan walked, much to the delight of (a) Andrew Flintoff and (b) me. When they return, Dan Rookwood will have the dubious honour of steering you though to the game's conclusion (a draw), so email your thoughts to dan.rookwood@theguardian.com and join him here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
