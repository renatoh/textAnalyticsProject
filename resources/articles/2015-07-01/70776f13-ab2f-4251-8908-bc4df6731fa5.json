The company\u2019s advertising revenue jumped 11% from last year to $16.02bn. Its consolidated revenue rose 11% to $17.73bn. The number of ads, or paid clicks, increased by 18%. After closing at $601.78, Google shares rose to $663.54 in after-hours trading. The almost 10% jump in stock \u201cis reflecting the fact that they\u2019ve effectively just beat earnings for the first time in several quarters,\u201d said Victor Anthony, an analyst at Axiom Capital. There was one other reason why investors and analysts were looking forward to Thursday\u2019s call: Ruth Porat, Google\u2019s new chief financial officer. Porat had previously worked as CFO at Morgan Stanley, and analysts were hoping that her past life on Wall Street would provide them with an ally on the other end of the phone. \u201cOur strong Q2 results reflect continued growth across the breadth of our products, most notably core search, where mobile stood out, as well as YouTube and programmatic advertising,\u201d Porat said on Thursday. \u201cWe are focused every day on developing big new opportunities across a wide range of businesses. We will do so with great care regarding resource allocation.\u201d According to Anthony, Porat\u2019s comment about Google exercising \u201cgreat care regarding resource allocation\u201d was another catalyst for boost in stock prices. Google\u2019s capital expenditures in the second quarter, which totaled about $2.5bn, were primarily related to production equipment and data center construction. \u201cIn our view, our infrastructure is one of our most strategic assets that we have,\u201d said Porat. When asked about the growth and success in the US, Porat attributed it to the company\u2019s \u201cdiverse set of products\u201d that continue to do well. Omid Kordestani, Google\u2019s chief business officer, echoed that sentiment. According to him, products like YouTube, Chrome and Android had over a billion users each. The earnings presentation also touted the new photo app, which allows users to upload, save and share their photos. Earlier this month, the app came under scrutiny after it automatically tagged a black couple as gorillas. Google apologized for the error and said that they are working on a long-term fix. \u201cIt\u2019s getting better every day,\u201d Kordestani said of the app on Thursday. Additionally, Porat fielded questions on regulatory pressures the company faces in Europe. In April, the European Commission accused Google of skewing its search results to benefit its own shopping services. \u201cWe see that Google has engaged in misconduct in a broad number of member states since 2008 and continues to do so,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, EU\u2019s competition commissioner, said at the time. \u201cThe commercial importance of appearing prominently in Google search results is obvious: if you can\u2019t be found, you can\u2019t do business.\u201d Skirting around the question, Porat said that Google operates within a competitive industry and looks forward to working with European Commission to address any concerns they might have.
