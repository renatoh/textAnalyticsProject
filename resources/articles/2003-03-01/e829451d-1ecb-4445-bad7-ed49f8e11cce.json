It took nine takes, he said. And each time, the train passing in the background had to be reversed up the tunnel and driven past again. \"You spunk all your time on something and then leave nothing for stuff you were supposed to be doing later in the day,\" he concluded. McGregor's film was part of a set of shorts funded by Sky TV called Tube Tales, which also showcased the directing talents of Jude Law and Bob Hoskins. Predictably, the results were painfully amateurish, and plans for a Tube Tales cinema release were quietly shelved. Even so, short films are booming again in Britain. The Film Council is sponsoring a wide assortment of schemes that will produce more than 100 shorts a year, and private companies are also investing heavily in shorts projects and competitions. In terms of finding and nurturing new talent, this makes perfect sense. From Ridley Scott to Lynne Ramsay, there are few successful British directors who didn't start out on shorts. The financial risk is relatively low (though you're still probably looking at a minimum outlay of \u00a330,000 for a 35mm project), and with a shorter production schedule there's more chance of recruiting some prestige actors. And the proliferation of festivals (such as Bristol's Brief Encounters and London's Rushes), websites, TV slots and even the return of shorts to regular cinemas, means there are more chances to get the films seen than ever before. Shorts are often being used to groom established talent from other disciplines. Renowned comics writer Neil Gaiman, for example, already has a feature deal with Warners to direct his own script for Death: The High Cost of Living. First, though, he is learning the ropes with a short film about comic artist John Bolton, made with Guy Ritchie's SKA films. It will be released on DVD in the near future. This is a strategy that has worked in the past. Former theatre director Stephen Daldry was given a prize-winning short-film script to cut his teeth with, and the result, Eight, was effectively a rehearsal for his feature debut, Billy Elliot. One film later, he is Britain's best hope for an Oscar. The Film Council is also gambling on star power. Its New Cinema Fund, in partnership with FilmFour Lab, has \u00a3500,000 a year with which to \"encourage directors, producers and other creative talent to push their creative boundaries.\" Three of the first four films in its flagship Extreme Cinema strand are by celebrity non-directors: The League of Gentlemen co-writer Jeremy Dyson, actor Jodhi May, and fashion photographer Rankin. None of them displays any great promise, it has to be said. Dyson's is an unengaging gothic horror comedy, May's is a confusing adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story, and Rankin's resembles a Dazed and Confused shoot come to life. How or why these particular novices were selected is not clear, though the production notes for May's film reveal that she voiced her directing ambitions to the producer of a feature film she was acting in, and he secured funding from Film Four Lab. Celebrities from other fields, particularly television comedy, have been more successful. Another of the New Cinema Fund strands, Comedy Shorts, invited established comedy writers to try their hand at directing, and the first four short films make their public debut next Monday. Best of the bunch is Hello Friend, a nightmarish information-age satire directed by Graham Linehan, writer of Father Ted and Black Books. Similarly, record label Warp's decision to finance Chris Morris's directing debut, My Wrongs 8245-8249 and 117, looks to have paid off. Although the 15-minute film was rumoured to have cost more than \u00a3150,000, the reputation Morris has acquired through TV shows like Brass Eye guaranteed public interest from the outset (the same could be said of artist Tracey Emin's planned feature based on her life story). My Wrongs won this year's short film Bafta and has been well received as a retail DVD release, and Morris is now exploring feature ideas. Meanwhile, Warp is also talking to another apprentice director: Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker. With the UK industry in its current state, perhaps nobody should be denied the chance to make a short. But non-celebrity directors are questioning whether the stars really deserve the chance to try a career change, or whether their brand recognition has simply blinded producers to their lack of potential. Promising unknown directors should still get their chance, though. Perhaps chastened by its experiments with Rankin, Dyson and May, the Film Council's new slate of Cinema Extreme films, which will premiere at this year's Edinburgh film festival, is celebrity-free. Likewise, Sky has long since slain the ghost of Tube Tales with an annual shorts competition for unknown directors, now in its fourth year. Sky could have already found Britain's answer to Jackie Chan: Ara Paiaya, whose no-budget kung-fu spoof Dubbed and Dangerous has led to a part in a real Chan movie. Warp is also scouring the country for undiscovered amateurs, and believes there is the same potential for home-made digital movies as there was for bedroom-produced music 10 years ago. With so many people on the hunt, no talent should remain undiscovered. \u00b7 Comedy Shorts are screening at the Curzon Soho, London W1, on Monday. Tickets: 0871 871 0022. The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Wednesday March 19 2003 We mistakenly suggested that the short films directed by Rankin, Jeremy Dyson and Jodhi May were co-funded by The Film Council and FilmFour Lab. In fact, they were solely funded by FilmFour Lab, and are not part of the The Film Council and FilmFour Lab's New Cinema Fund scheme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
