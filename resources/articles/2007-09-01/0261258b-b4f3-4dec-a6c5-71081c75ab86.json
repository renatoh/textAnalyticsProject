Shares fell by a fifth in afternoon trading after two major shareholders dumped their stakes and the bank's survival prospects appeared to decline. By the time the market closed, Britain's fifth biggest mortgage lender with 800,000 borrowers was worth little more than \u00a31bn. A bail-out by the Bank of England and the guarantee on all deposits announced by Alistair Darling, the chancellor, on Monday night initially put a floor under the bank's value, but rumours that Lloyds TSB was preparing a bid as low as \u00a32 a share upset the bank's precarious recovery. The shares ended down 16% at 257p, after falling to 246p, the lowest level since the bank converted from a building society almost exactly 10 years ago. Shares had hit a high of over \u00a312 in February. Analysts said the Lloyds TSB approach was one of several rumoured bids that could nevertheless still prove to be in excess of the bank's value. Lloyds TSB, already a big player in the mortgage market through its Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester arm, is understood to have approached the regulator about a possible takeover before Northern Rock's near-collapse with a \u00a33-a-share bid. The offer failed when a request from Lloyds TSB for further subsidies from the Bank of England was rejected. One shareholder said the bank's days as an independent operator were numbered: \"Northern Rock needs to sell itself to someone quickly. They do not have any sort of medium-term or long-term future, but any offer is going to be at a pretty low level. The brand is tarnished, the branch network is small and a wholesale funding model like theirs will not work again.\" Alex Potter, banking analyst at Collins Stewart, said: \"We can safely assume all the banks have now examined Northern Rock and decided they don't want it except at a ridiculously low price. In this case we could see the bank wither on the vine.\" Another analyst said it could become the mortgage arm of the Bank of England if it continued in business only after handing much of its mortgage book to the central bank in return for loans. Northern Rock is expected to begin drawing on the funds made available by the Bank of England this week as it seeks to refinance millions of pounds worth of mortgages. Colin Morton at Rensburg Fund Management, who sold his stake in the bank on Friday, said: \"There is still risk. This is a company that needs a lot of funding in the wholesale market.\" He added that the housing market looked as if it was slowing. Criticism of the Northern Rock board spread from the political arena to institutional investors who suggested directors must take some of the blame for the debacle that has engulfed the mortgage bank. One accused the bank's non-executives, led by chairman Matt Ridley, of ignoring the warning signs that the Northern Rock's business model could be fragile. Another pointed to the bank's \"aggressive and lavish remuneration policy\", saying it suggested the full-time executives, led by chief executive Adam Applegarth, \"wielded a lot of clout\" and held the balance of power in the boardroom. Mr Applegarth was paid \u00a31.3m last year, half as a basic salary and half in bonuses. One investor, who reduced his holding earlier this year, said: \"There is an argument to be made about whether the non-executives sufficiently questioned the business model, given that it was so different to the rest of the market.\" Another investment professional asked: \"Did the board of the Northern Rock exercise proper oversight over the business model? The role of the board, and their audit committees is bound to come under the spotlight because of this.\" A leading fund manager said the directors appeared to have ignored warnings from the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority. \"The FSA and the Bank have been saying for some time that short-term borrowing and long-term lending was a very dangerous position to be in. They weren't naming names, but those directors should have known it was aimed at them,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
