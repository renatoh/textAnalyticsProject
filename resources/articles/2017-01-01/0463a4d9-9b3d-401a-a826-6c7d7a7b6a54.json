The Dutchman, 65, has been out of work since leaving Manchester United in May \u2013 just two days after he led them to victory in the FA Cup final. Despite initially stating that he was keen to work again after two years at Old Trafford, Van Gaal told the Dutch newspaper the Telegraaf on Monday that \u201cevents in his family\u201d have persuaded him not to despite the chance to earn a lucrative salary overseas. \u201cI could go there, but I\u2019m still here,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cSo much has happened in my family.\u201d Van Gaal also managed Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Holland in a coaching career that began in 1991. He said after leaving United that he was interested in coaching again, but that door now seems to have closed. The report said that last month one of his daughters lost her husband, and that has weighed heavily on his decision. \u201cI thought maybe I would stop, then I thought it would be a sabbatical, but now I do not think I will return to coaching,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
