Primark, Matalan and the Edinburgh Woollen Mill are among retailers that have collectively cancelled \u00a31.4bn and suspended an additional \u00a31bn of orders as they scramble to minimise losses, according to BGMEA. This includes nearly \u00a31.3bn of orders that were already in production or had been completed. Other brands included in the data, including Next, Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco have since said they will honour existing orders that have been placed with Bangladeshi suppliers. The BGMEA said the impact of the cancellations has already been \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for Bangladesh. More than one-quarter of the country\u2019s 4 million garment workers have already lost their jobs or have been furloughed without pay because of order cancellations or the refusal of brands to pay for cancelled shipments. A survey of nearly 300 Bangladeshi garment suppliers by the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC) and Penn State University, found that western retailers have been using force majeure clauses in their contracts to cancel or suspend orders in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Factory owners in Bangladesh told the Guardian that brands and retailers are postponing the delivery of orders that have already been produced by garment factories so invoices can\u2019t be raised. They are also cancelling all upcoming orders and refusing to pay the cost of raw materials already purchased by suppliers. \u201cWe have had to temporarily close our factory for the health and safety of our workers but we are facing ruin because brands and retailers are cancelling orders that we have already produced and if they don\u2019t pay, I can\u2019t pay the workers,\u201dsaid Mostafiz Uddin, the chief executive of the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange and managing director of Denim Expert, a clothing company that supplies international brands including Peacocks in the UK. \u201cWe have to pay upfront for all of our materials and banks are blocking my accounts. I can\u2019t even pay the utility bills. We can\u2019t do anything because after this is over we will need to work with these brands again so we are powerless to fight them,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep at night. I have 2,000 workers but they are all supporting another 10,000 family members. What will I tell them about their jobs and their pay?\u201d More than 97% of the suppliers surveyed by the WRC and Penn State University said brands had offered no financial assistance in covering the cost of furloughing workers or helping to pay severance costs. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a wholesale abandoning of workers and suppliers,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of the WRC. \u201cThe way that the garment supply chain is set up, the suppliers take all the risk. They buy the cloth, hire the workers and make the clothes but can\u2019t raise an invoice until the order is shipped. If brands cancel existing orders and refuse shipment then invoices can\u2019t be sent and nobody in Bangladesh gets paid.\u201d In a statement, Primark said that, while it recognised and was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the effect this would have further down its supply chain, it had had \u201cno option\u201d but to cancel orders that had been placed with their Bangladeshi suppliers. \u201cIf we had not taken this action, we would be taking delivery of stock that we simply could not sell,\u201d Primark said in a statement. \u201cThis has been unprecedented action for unprecedented and frankly unimaginable times\u201d Edinburgh Woollen Mill also confirmed it has cancelled all existing orders saying, \u201cOur relationships with suppliers are absolutely fundamental to our business, and this is not what we would ever normally wish to do but the current circumstances are such that this is a necessity.\u201d Matalan would not confirm whether they had cancelled orders. By email, they said the company was \u201clooking at multiple ways of repurposing or postponing, rather than cancelling wherever possible.\u201d After the BGMEA data was published, Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer said they were now working with Bangladeshi suppliers to honour existing orders. Tesco is also refuting the figure published in the BGMEA data that it cancelled \u00a350m of orders. In a statement, Next said that as all its shops are currently closed it is cancelling some orders, but will honour existing agreements that are in place up to 10 April. Other brands including H&amp;M, Next and Zara said they would also honour existing financial arrangements with their Bangladeshi suppliers and pay invoices in full for orders already placed. Aruna Kashyap, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch said that the situation in Bangladesh exposed the lack of any sort of protection for workers who make huge profits for international fashion brands. Workers who have been furloughed or lost their jobs would struggle to find any way to support their families throughout a Covid-19 lockdown and it could take years for the garment industry to recover, Kashyap said. \u201cThe brands are trying to minimise their losses but the impact on the ground in Bangladesh has already been catastrophic and will spell disaster for millions of families,\u201d she said. \u201cRetailers are calling on the governments of garment-producing countries to provide support for workers, but if you\u2019re going to base your hugely profitable supply chain in countries where you know no such social safety net is available, you have to take responsibility when things go wrong.\u201d This article was amended on 3 April 2020 to add additional information."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
