This mightily impressive display was only a start \u2013 acid tests against Germany and the United States follow in the remaining games of the SheBelieves tournament. Then the real work of preparing for an assault on the World Cup begins in earnest. \u201cI was a little bit nervous before the game, I had a few butterflies, but my players didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThere is great expectation and I love that expectation. On the bus, on the way to the ground, it felt right. It felt right standing in the technical area and the most important thing is the players are enjoying the raised expectations and the higher profile.\u201d Such an emphatic result, even if Neville\u2019s confidence was brimming in the buildup, was a surprise, especially considering this win over France was only the second time England have beaten them in 44 years. The rain had been teeming down all day here ensuring the wide open stands at the Mapfre Stadium were a sea of yellow seats and very few spectators. The hardy souls who braved the elements, however, were treated to a new dawn breaking. Neville has retained most the squad which reached the semi-finals of last year\u2019s European Championships although there were some notable inclusions. Chelsea\u2019s Anita Asante, who fell out of favour under former manager Mark Sampson in 2015, earned a recall while Manchester City\u2019s highly-rated midfielder Keira Walsh, 20, earned just her second cap. With just a minute on the clock Fran Kirby almost opened the scoring when a close-range effort was saved by the France goalkeeper Karima Benameur. It was an encouraging start made even better on six minutes when Toni Duggan brilliantly curled in following good work by Nikita Parris and Kirby, the 20th international goal for the Barcelona forward. Asante\u2019s afternoon sadly ended soon after, the Chelsea defender catching her leg in the turf and appearing to hurt her knee, allowing Abbie McManus to win her first cap. Jodie Taylor\u2019s audacious chip hit the bar and was unfortunate not to rebound in off Benameur who was by the far the busier of the goalkeepers. On reflection, she will realise her effort to keep out Jill Scott\u2019s strike on 27 minutes should have been better, though no one could argue Neville\u2019s side did not deserve it when the industrious Taylor latched on to a Parris through-ball to put the dispirited French out of sight after 39 minutes. Two minutes after the break, Scott crossed for Kirby who scored with aplomb. Ga\u00ebtane Thiney\u2019s deflected consolation off Millie Bright on 77 minutes mattered not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
