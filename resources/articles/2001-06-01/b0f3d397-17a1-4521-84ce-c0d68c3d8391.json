With Villa on the verge of taking Kachloul's fellow Moroccan Mustapha Hadji from Coventry, yesterday's signing could mean the end of David Ginola's stay at Villa Park. Kachloul, available on a Bosman free transfer from Southampton, provoked an irate reaction from Ipswich. \"The news has come as a big shock to us as we trusted the word of Hassan and his agent,\" the club said in a statement. \"Ipswich Town is built on solid foundations where honour and integrity are fundamental to our future success. The club has shown great trust in Kachloul but unfortunately it has not be reciprocated.\" Kachloul, who turned down a move to Ipswich at the start of last season, had announced his move to East Anglia on his website and yesterday apologised for his change of heart: \"This has been the hardest decision of my career and I am genuinely sorry to let these people down.\" Having missed out on signing the French international Lilian Thuram, there was better news for Manchester United after the England defender Wes Brown confirmed he is to open talks on a new contract.

Newcastle's Peruvian winger Nolberto Solano, under investigation by the Home Office over the validity of his Greek passport, has signed a new five-year contract at St James' Park. The England under-21 international Andy Griffin has also signed a three-year deal. \u0095 Football League newcomers Rushden &amp; Diamonds face a trip to First Division Burnley following the draw for the first round of next season's Worthington Cup.
