In a rare public statement, Alvarez said it had been \u201cincredibly hard\u201d for her to watch her husband vilified by the media and even harder to watch him be attacked by his own party. \u201cThe brutal irony is that if we had pulled together, we would have been ready to lead the country rather than suffer more austerity under the Tories,\u201d she wrote in the Mirror. \u201cMy greatest wish ahead of the 2017 general election was that the party would stay together so that we could beat them. Unfortunately, my wish was not granted and I will forever think of that lost moment when we were so close to winning for the people of the United Kingdom.\u201d Corbyn is due to step down after five years as Labour leader on Saturday. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, is widely expected to win the race to replace him, which started \u2013 unofficially \u2013 after December\u2019s general election, in which the party won its lowest number of seats since 1935. Voting opened in the competition on 24 February and closed on Thursday. The three candidates \u2013 Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy \u2013 have been asked to pre-record victory speeches to be issued as soon as the result is announced. Alvarez said: \u201cIt has been incredibly hard for me to watch my husband vilified and to hear his words twisted by his political opponents and some in the media. It has been even harder to watch him be attacked by his own party.\u201d The human rights lawyer said Corbyn had told her the first thing he would do if he became prime minister after the 2019 election was to spend more money on the NHS. \u201cI read about the work that our amazing heroes in the NHS are doing during the coronavirus outbreak and only wish that the investment our health service needs had been offered long before now,\u201d she said. Alvarez said it had been the privilege of her life to meet people across the country as part of Corbyn\u2019s work as Labour leader. \u201cWe are all part of the cosmos and we all have a part to play in rebuilding our movement.\u201d She thanked people who voted for Labour and supported her husband, and urged the party not to lose sight of its \u201ccommitment to socialism and the policies of the manifesto\u201d. \u201cWe know you shared our values. If equality, humanity, honesty and kindness is called Corbynism, then that\u2019s all right with me,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
