The move for the 26-year old, who scored 17 goals for the south coast club last season, marks a change of policy by Doug Ellis, Villa's much criticised chairman who had told the manager David O'Leary that he had only \u00a34.5m to spend during the close season. O'Leary has already accounted for that by paying \u00a33m for the Denmark defender Martin Laursen and the remainder on the former France Under-21 midfielder Mathieu Berson. But O'Leary, under orders from Ellis to qualify for the Champions League this season, has made it clear that he needs another striker to stand a chance of achieving that objective. The England international Darius Vassell is seen as too lightweight to be a regular partner for Juan Pablo Angel, on-loan Carlton Cole is viewed as too inexperienced, and Marcus Allback is out of favour. The about-turn by Ellis follows news that a motion of no confidence in his leadership will be proposed by the rebel shareholders' group, the Aston Villa Shareholders Association, at next month's AGM. Villa refused to comment on the bid last night but it is understood they believe they have a 50-50 chance of succeeding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
