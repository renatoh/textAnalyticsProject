Want to pay a star a compliment and get guaranteed press coverage? Name a piece of clothing after a celeb. When Giambattista Valli created the Victoria shoe for Posh, she wore them for a US Elle shoot and gave a glowing review on her blog. Nice work, Valli. Agyness Deyn is the model du jour, so why shouldn't Mulberry capitalise by naming this season's tote in her honour? It certainly worked for Marc Jacobs - his bag (named after model Jessica Stam) was the It bag of 2006 and is still going strong. Of course, affiliating your brand with celebrities can be problematic. Jonathan Kelsey's Amy shoes are elegant heels, but who looks at Ms Winehouse's feet now without thinking of bloody ballet pumps? The Plant Love make-up range boasts a revolutionary, eco-friendly botanical lipstick. Shame they named it after Lindsay Lohan, who may have completed rehab now, but is some way from being a role model of clean living. Hermes, meanwhile, is best known for the Kelly and the Birkin, named for beautiful Princess Grace and groovy Jane. So why has the company asked Naomi Campbell to design a bag? For us, the grumpy old supermodel just isn't in the same class. Designers, we understand the lure of the celebrity, but pick the wrong star and you'll go out of fashion as they do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
