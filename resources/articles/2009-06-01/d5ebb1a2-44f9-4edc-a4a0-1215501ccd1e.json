The new woolworths.co.uk website will offer a range of some half a million products in four categories \u2013 childrenswear, toys, entertainment and party goods. The familiar red logo, tweaked \"for the digital age\", has also been resurrected. Pick'n'mix also gets a digital makeover \u2013 becoming \"click'n'mix\". The 99-year-old Woolworths chain collapsed last November as a result of mounting debts and sliding sales. It has been one of the highest-profile victims of the credit crunch and the recession. Some 800 stores were closed and 30,000 staff lost their jobs. But in February the Woolworths brand name was bought from the retailer's administrator Deloitte, for an undisclosed price, by the Barclay brothers. The reclusive duo also bought the Ladybird brand. Their other business interests include ownership of the Daily Telegraph. The new Woollies is now part of the Barclays' Shop Direct mail order and online retailing empire, which includes Littlewoods, Kays, Marshall Ward and Great Universal. Under Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay's ownership these brands have built up a big share of the fast-growing home delivery shopping market. Their web sales have risen from 18% to 56% in three years. Shop Direct is hoping the new online Woolies will appeal to the family market and tap into the burgeoning trend to shop online. The site will consist of three \"shops\". The main store will sell branded toys, consumer electronics and the Ladybird range; an entertainment shop will specialise in CDs, DVDs, books and games; while the party shop will specialise in fancy-dress outfits, partywear, goody bags and balloons. This shop will also include the click'n'mix sweet selection. The site will encourage families to register in a club, which will offer perks like days out and movie screenings. The online operation will also sell many products that were too big to sell in stores, such as barbecues, outdoor tables and chairs and family-sized swimming pools. But the household goods Woolworths was famous for will not be on offer. \"We've been talking to families across the country and have responded with a site that delivers the best of what they loved about Woollies,\" said Mark Newton-Jones, Shop Direct group chief executive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
