William Hill's chief executive, David Harding, said comparable gross win had recovered from a difficult six months and was ahead by 5.5% for the nine weeks to August. \"It could have been better,\" he said. \"Pricewise [Mr Segal's column] has had winning tips every Saturday for the last 10 weeks. It could have been better if it wasn't for him.\" Mr Segal's sustained run, which came to an end this weekend, captured the imagination of many punters, leading to dramatic swings in prices each week after his predictions were published. The run included tips on a number of big-price winners including Sargeant Cecil for the Northumberland Plate in June at 20-1. William Hill reported yesterday a 12% dip in sports bet takings at its shops for the first six months of 2005. The decline was largely offset by a 34% rise in earnings from touch-screen roulette machines, known as fixed-odds betting terminals. The group's emerging poker business grew by 150%. In June the company acquired Stanley Leisure's 624 betting shops, taking its total outlets to more than 2,100 but also forcing it to scrap plans to return \u00a3450m to shareholders. Yesterday William Hill resurrected scaled-back proposals for a shareholder payout, confirming it would spend between \u00a3200m and \u00a3300m on share buybacks. Total betting shop gross win fell by 0.5% for the six months to June 28, with pre-tax profits down 11% at \u00a3100m, hit in part by \u00a39.5m costs relating to the Stanley Leisure deal and the continuing installation of computerised tills. Mr Harding said he was looking forward to next year's football World Cup providing a boost to trading. Last year's surprise victory for Greece at Euro 2004 was a particularly favourable outcome for all British bookmakers. Mr Harding said some 750 staff, including shop workers, telephonists and engineers, have shared a \u00a39m windfall this month after a share scheme matured. The scheme, established when William Hill floated on the stock exchange three years ago, allowed participants to buy \u00a3250 of shares a month at a substantial discount. Those buying the maximum allowance have made a profit of more than \u00a321,000. The average payout was \u00a312,000. According to the Guardian's annual pay survey, William Hill is among the 10 lowest-paying FTSE 100 employers, with average wages of \u00a310,152. Last year Mr Harding cashed in \u00a35m in option gains to fund his divorce settlement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
