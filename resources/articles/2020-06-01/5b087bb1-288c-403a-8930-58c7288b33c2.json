The manager, who has worked wonders at Molineux since his arrival in May 2017, has one year remaining on his deal and has attracted admirers from a variety of clubs. Securing the Portuguese\u2019s services for the foreseeable future would be a precious boost for Wolves, and the manager said the return of the Premier League after lockdown meant discussions could begin. \u201cWhen you have something so serious [as the peak of coronavirus] to take care of, you don\u2019t think of anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring this pandemic I think everybody worldwide was thinking about their own families. Now we are back we will have time to talk.\u201d Asked whether he was keen to stay, he replied: \u201cWe are still under contract. We are here and it\u2019s good to be here.\u201d Nuno has lifted Wolves from the Championship to the upper reaches of the Premier League and the latter stages of this season\u2019s Europa League, all while playing slick and dynamic football. The team , seventh in the table, have Champions League qualification in their sights as they prepare to play at West Ham on Saturday. Morgan Gibbs-White will be available for selection, with the manager explaining that the 20-year-old had learned his lesson after being pictured at a house party in May in defiance of the government\u2019s lockdown guidelines. \u201cHe was immediately aware of the mistake he made, so I am positive it was a lesson for his life,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody can make mistakes and everybody wants and needs a second chance. Morgan did something that, at his age and at a normal moment, would be so natural. \u201cFor me it was more a lack of self-protection and protecting others than an indiscipline act. So we dealt with that. He spent a time in self-isolation and the moment he was tested negative he integrated immediately with the squad.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
