The Brazilian has cost a British-record \u00a332.5m after a remarkable transfer-deadline day in which Manchester United managed to rush through Dimitar Berbatov's signing on a four year-deal for a fee of \u00a330.75m - which also includes a year-long loan of Fraizer Campbell to Spurs, who will drop their complaint about United's \"tapping-up\" of the Bulgarian. After that Abramovich was left under no illusion that Chelsea are no longer the financial superpower of English football. Never has Abramovich lost out in a straight battle of money for a player's transfer. And never before have City had the financial muscle that comes from being backed by an organisation as powerful as the Abu Dhabi United Group, comprising members of the super-rich United Arab Emirates royal family and the multi-billionaire Sulaiman Al Fahim. On a seminal day that saw Thaksin sell the club for \u00a3210m and relinquish his chairmanship, Robinho's arrival represents an immediate statement of intent - a box-office signing that takes their spending to \u00a370m since Mark Hughes replaced Sven-Goran Eriksson as manager. \"I am absolutely delighted to get the opportunity to work with such an incredible talent like Robinho,\" said Hughes, who will give the Brazilian a debut, against Chelsea, on September 13. \"In order to compete with the best teams in the Premier League we have to be in the market for players of this calibre, and Robinho is undoubtedly one of the best in the world. I am really looking forward to introducing him to the rest of the squad and to the City fans. This is a real statement of intent as to the ambitions of Manchester City.\" The transfer represents a major disappointment for Chelsea and their manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, who had identified Robinho as his principal target, and the player had gone so far as to give a bizarre press briefing in Madrid on Sunday declaring his wish to move to Stamford Bridge. \"We decided that the best thing was for him to leave,\" said Real's president Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n last night. \"He has an emotional problem that is worse than we thought. Every time I have spoken to him he has cried; he wanted to leave. It was best for him to walk away for footballing and personal reasons. [Bernd] Schuster [the coach] agrees with the sale. We have sold him for an important amount of money.\" Indeed the lesson of the past 24 hours is that the Premier League has a new big hitter. \"I just wish we could have done it [the takeover] earlier to give us more time to spend but unfortunately I was on vacation travelling across Europe when the proposition reached me,\" said Al Fahim. \"Thierry Henry and [Brazil's] Ronaldo can add the confidence and the experience and provide the mix with he younger players. These are the kind of players we are looking for. We have deep pockets.\" A day of high-stakes negotiating began with City bidding \u00a334m in a late, ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to hijack United's move for Berbatov. At the same time City made an opening bid of \u00a328.5m for Robinho as well as contacting Valencia to see whether \u00a340m would persuade them to sell David Villa and offering in excess of \u00a310m for another striker, Stuttgart's Mario G\u00f3mez. Valencia and Stuttgart did not want to sell, and Berbatov always had his heart set on Old Trafford, but Real were willing to do business provided City offered another \u00a34m. As Al Fahim said: \"Money is not a worry to my board.\" City were unable to compete with United, however, when it came to Berbatov, despite offering Tottenham a more lucrative deal and letting the Bulgarian know through intermediaries that they would pay him more in wages. To the intense irritation of Spurs, Berbatov flew into Manchester yesterday without permission and was picked up at the airport by Sir Alex Ferguson. He was then taken to the training ground before being driven to a hospital to undergo a medical while United came to a compromise with Spurs over the fee. \"This is a key signing,\" said Ferguson. \"Dimitar is one of the best and most exciting strikers in world football. His style and ability will give the team a different dimension.\" Tottenham earlier completed the \u00a314m signing of Roman Pavlyuchenko from Spartak Moscow, as well as bringing in the \u00a38m defender Vedran Corluka from City. They would rather have sold Berbatov to City and also took a call from Real offering \u00a336m. However, Berbatov made it clear he was interested only in United and Spurs had no option but to reopen talks.
