And, while the president-elect sends his views to millions on Twitter, the former (and possibly future) Ukip leader has opted for the more old-fashioned public platform of a radio phone-in. On Monday night, the politician who forced the EU referendum that led eventually to Brexit hosted his first talk show on the 7-8pm slot on the LBC radio station. He will appear on the station from Monday to Thursday, leaving Fridays free for fishing or attending the inaugurations of friends who have become US president. Unusually for a presenter, Farage was quoted in the 7pm news bulletin for his views on Monday\u2019s London Underground strike. His show started with a sort of a capella jingle where a number of people name-checked him \u2013 all pronouncing his surname slightly differently culminating in a shout-out from Trump. \u201cThis show is all about you!\u201d Farage declared \u2013 although this remark paradoxically came in the middle of an opening monologue lasting several minutes. The show\u2019s format seems to be that Farage throws out a question a night and the first was: \u201cIs Theresa May holding her cards [on Brexit] too close to her chest?\u201d Should you ever be asked in a pub quiz who the first ever caller to The Nigel Farage Show was, the answer is Sarah in Clapham. She felt the PM was holding the deck at exactly the right distance but Farage disagreed. And Pip from Waltham Cross agreed with him: \u201cOh, dear. I voted Brexit and am becoming increasingly dismayed with Theresa May\u2019s spectacular failure to launch.\u201d Almost all the callers were Brexiters, unhappy with the present occupant of No 10 \u2013 and some were keen to suggest an alternative. Caller Carla argued: \u201cWe should have a Ukip government, Nigel, with you leading the negotiations.\u201d Tony from Canary Wharf said: \u201cYou have changed world history.\u201d Interestingly for psephologists, Tony described himself as a socialist \u2013 a Canary Wharf down a coalmine for the left, possibly. LBC began life as a London-only station but digitalisation has opened it up to the world. Richard, calling from the Philippines at 3.20am local time, was a remain voter who wanted May to move more quickly. Catherine in Dallas said she would be worried if she were a British Brexiter. The chorus of approval was interrupted only at the very end by Chris from Manchester, who asked how Farage felt about duping the working people of Britain into voting for something that was bad for them. As Nick Clegg discovered when he underestimated Farage in TV debates before the European parliamentary elections in 2014 and again before the 2015 election, the Ukip man is a fluent and clear speaker. He sometimes swallowed mid-sentence, and was occasionally slushy, with Facebook coming out as \u201cFaishbook.\u201d But the hour passed quickly, helped by lengthy sections of adverts and trails for other LBC shows \u2013 possibly so that Farage could pop out for a fag. He can\u2019t, though, fill four nights a week baiting May over Article 50. The test will be whether he can sustain his own and his listeners\u2019 interest for an hour on the NHS, Syria or (Monday night\u2019s actual headline story) the collapse of the Northern Irish government. My guess is that LBC is gambling that Farage can deliver an interview with Trump, and his promise to present the show \u201cfrom around the world\u201d hints that he might be productive in Washington DC even if he doesn\u2019t become UK ambassador there. Strikingly, Farage\u2019s main UK rival for a Trump interview is Piers Morgan, who works for ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, and Theresa May gave her first interview of 2017 to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Monday. BBC and ITN must be feeling nervous that political broadcasting is getting broader. Given how rude Farage was about the PM in his closing monologue (claiming she lacks the \u201cenergy, excitement or flair\u201d to lead the country), \u201cTheresa from Westminster\u201d seems very unlikely to call The Nigel Farage Show. But the fact that \u201cDonald from Washington\u201d coming on the line cannot entirely be ruled out should ensure continuing focus on a show that, in its first episode, felt rather one-note."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
