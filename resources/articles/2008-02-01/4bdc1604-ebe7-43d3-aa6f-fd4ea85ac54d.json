The Scot, who missed Great Britain's Davis Cup tie against Argentina last week because of a knee complaint, was fighting fit as he brushed aside the Frenchman in barely an hour, breaking Mathieu twice in each set to reach his second final of this year. Murray started strongly, immediately breaking the home favourite who aided his opponent with a nervous double fault. Mathieu held his next service game to make it 2-1 but Murray maintained his advantage, winning the fourth game without losing a point to go 3-1 up before comfortably serving out. Mathieu rallied to hold his opening service game in the second set, despite Murray having a break point. But it was only a brief reprieve, as Murray - six years younger than his opponent - reeled off three consecutive games to take gain a commanding advantage. The Frenchman was overwhelmed as Murray broke again and then soon served for the match, earning three match points with an ace. Mathieu survived the first but hit a backhand into the net on the second to allow Murray to wrap up the match and book his place in tomorrow's final against Croatia's Mario Ancic, who beat last year's finalist Marcos Baghdatis 6-4, 6-2. Murray and Ancic have played once before, in Auckland in 2006, when the Croat won 6-3, 7-6. \"My return was unbelievable,\" said Murray. \"I hope it can go on tomorrow.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
