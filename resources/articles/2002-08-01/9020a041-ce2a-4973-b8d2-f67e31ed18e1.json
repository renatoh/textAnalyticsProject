Teacher supply agencies have reported being approached by headteachers who were ready to absolve them of blame in writing in advance if anything went wrong with teachers they hired. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation, representing the agencies, said hiring teachers without any background checks was against its policy and that of the Department for Education and Skills. But an REC spokeswoman said: \"More than one agency has reported - so I'm assuming it is more than one school - that schools are saying, we will take anybody, regardless of any checks, not because they don't want to abide by the rules, but because they can't wait months to get supply teachers in.\" However, the DfES refutes the claim by the confederation and insists teachers who have not had the appropriate checks will not be allowed into schools. A DfES spokesman said: \"There is no evidence to suggest that. \"We are having good success in making sure that schools have the right number of teachers for September. We don't allow people to go into schools without background checks.\" Earlier this year, the Criminal Records Bureau was formed to amalgamate the work of the police, the DfES and the health department providing a one-stop-shop for checking the backgrounds of adults wanting to work with children. However, since it opened in April, a backlog of applications has built up and in May the DfES announced it would take back responsibility for checking those on List 99 - a database of information on people banned from teaching by the secretary of state - in a bid to alleviate the backlog. Supply agencies are able to apply directly to have teachers checked to see if they are on List 99, which details those suspected or convicted of child abuse. The CRB has continued to carry out criminal records checks, which take longer. While there is concern that teachers taking up posts in September have not been fully vetted for a criminal record, the DfES insists that there is no evidence that suspected or convicted paedophiles would be allowed to work in schools. Chris Keates, deputy general secretary of the National Association of School Masters Union of Women Teachers, said her members identified the backlog and the ensuing problems from the start, but following a series of meetings, the CRB gave assurances the backlog would be cleared by September. Ms Keates said: \"We take this very seriously. While we understand the need to staff schools, I would certainly urge caution to members. If they are taking on staff who haven't been checked they are taking an enormous risk. \"It is putting the school in an extremely vulnerable position, if they take on someone who hasn't been checked and subsequently something happens to a child.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
