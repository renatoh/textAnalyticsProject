Not because I am a beauty editor but because consistency in an unpredictable climate is my coping mechanism. If you can\u2019t be bothered to go the whole hog, consider a minimalist look that is one step beyond the no-makeup mantra. A shot of colour around one eye (as at Jamie Wei Huang SS20) is fun, audacious and, yes, a little edgy but, fundamentally, takes no effort at all. Perhaps in the weeks to come, you\u2019ll find the drive to colour the other one in. 1. Chanel Le Liner De Chanel \u00a328, chanel.com 2. Mac Eyeshadow in Steamy \u00a315, maccosmetics.co.uk 3.

A reformulated favourite that\u2019s better than ever You may have noticed that a product you\u2019ve loved and used for years no longer performs in the same way. Often it\u2019s because it has been reformulated. Sometimes the brand will tell you. Sometimes it won\u2019t. Many do it to save money. This is shortsighted, particularly when the result is a product that no longer delivers \u2013 and disgruntled customers. Others do it to keep their formulations technologically advanced \u2013 when it works, it is brilliant. But often it doesn\u2019t. So it didn\u2019t fill me with glee when I discovered one of my favourite products, Becca\u2019s Shimmering Skin Perfector, was to be upgraded and renamed. When I recommend mixing a liquid highlighter into foundation for a stupendous glow, this is one I always suggest. When I meet a fellow lover of it, it becomes a love-in. When I consider desert-island products, this makes the cut. So how does the new iteration compare? Thankfully, it is as superb. Like its predecessor, it is a pearlised gel formula \u2013 still in six shades for all skin tones \u2013 but lighter, more hydrating, more intense (so you won\u2019t need as much), and you can use it all over your body. Some elements will be polarising, namely the new fruity scent - pineapple, coconut and orange flower \u2013 and the new-agey name changes (Topaz is now Strength, Champagne Pop is now Creativity). Formulation-wise, however, you won\u2019t be disappointed.
