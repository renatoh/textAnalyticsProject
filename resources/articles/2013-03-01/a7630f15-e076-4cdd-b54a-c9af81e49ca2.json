Or else, you could do it Dad's Army-style, using the war mainly for uniforms and comedic scenarios, making sure the only people who die are idiots or invisible insurgents in far-off sheds. That's what BBC3's Bluestone 42 (pronounced four-two, if you want to pretend you watched it, and not watch it) has done: it's very broad and kind, and I was impressed by it. It was confident and deft, and brooked no squeamishness, no uncertainty about which jokes you're allowed to make and which you aren't (though there's one running gag, in which a squaddie mocks a dead American and is persistently told that it's too soon, that one infers was generated by the writing process. \"A suicide bomb? Would that be funny, if it only got adults?\" \"Too soon.\") It's by the Miranda writing team, and has that distinctive worldview in which people are basically nice, and the comedy comes from the degrees of absurdity by which that niceness is manifested. And, like Miranda, a lot of its watchability comes not from actual laughs, but from enjoying the company of the nice people. Inevitably, however, this means that it never gets anywhere near the bone, and has none of that wincing discomfort that has one, while watching Peep Show or The Thick of It, literally drawing away from the telly, crying. While on the one hand it feels unfair to judge all comedy by the best of it, I sometimes think television could apply some industry standards, and learn from itself, like science. Some joke structures persistently don't work; they clank along the ground like an exhaust pipe falling off a van. I'm thinking in particular of the Socratic school of joke, demonstrated here when phlegmatic and likable Katie Lyons (playing a soldier called Bird) hefts down the material for this exchange like a scree: \"So you've never named anything?\" she asks another soldier. \"Nothing except my cock, which is called Andy McNab.\" \"Why would you name your cock Andy McNab?\" Because of all the action it's seen \u2026 because it would survive on nuts and berries \u2026 because it's full of bollocks \u2026 I'm paraphrasing but, seriously, it's only one rung above a knock-knock joke. In short, it could be harder on itself, and harder on the viewer, and probably a bit harder on the cast, and we would still like it, and maybe love it. The Crash (BBC3) was about a car crash. The title really blew the suspense of this two-part teen drama. That's fine. But they spent at least five minutes setting up the suspense (\"whose car are you going to go in?\" \"Your car\" \"Why not their car?\" \"They might want some privacy in their car.\" \"Do you want to wear a seatbelt?\" \"What's that maniac doing, overtaking on these narrow and ill-lit country lanes?\" \"It seems weird that we don't know each other, even though the rest of us have all been friends since we were babies, and the only way the viewer can tell we're not related is when we do our gorgeous, flawless necking\" \"I'm going to overtake that maniac, I'm sure this will work out OK \u2026\") and that five minutes could have been spent some other way. They could have differentiated the parents a little bit, since at the moment they are all one mountain range of middle-aged hillocks: sensible, parental, readying themselves for anguish. Danielle Nardini in particular is woefully underused, though that could correct itself in the next episode. I normally find young people who all love each other easy to dislike, but here there was something endearing about them, a very slightly spiky way of talking to one another, a soundtrack that wasn't One Direction. Nevertheless, the feelgood indicators will be far too sweet for the weaker stomach (Leave our front doors open? Check! Spontaneously hug whenever we're in the same room? Check! Give one another jewellery, accompanied by carefully enumerated speeches of maternal pride or comradely love? Check! Propose marriage to one another, even though you are only 18, presumably, and should get more shagging in before you take such a step? Check!). All the bleeding teenagers in the world couldn't darken this mood, especially when there's nobody even trying to kill them deliberately."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
