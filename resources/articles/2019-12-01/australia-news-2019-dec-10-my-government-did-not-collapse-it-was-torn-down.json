However, I am perplexed that David Marr would use the word \u201ccollapse\u201d to describe the end of my leadership, as though it simply fell apart of its own accord. As you would recall, there was no great scandal that brought my leadership to an end. It was a premeditated coup led by a small group of faceless men from the factions, seizing on Julia Gillard\u2019s own personal ambition to reach the top, who took the opportunity to advance their own interests. Where John Howard lost seven ministers in the first 18 months of government, we lost only one. At the time of the coup, Labor had lost only one out of 86 polls. This was despite bringing in landmark reforms \u2013 from a mandatory renewable energy target to paid parental leave to aged pension reform \u2013 while seeing the country through the global financial crisis. The Australian people lost faith in politics on the day of the coup, when they witnessed a government working to help ordinary Australians fall prey to the backroom wheeler-dealers guided by personal ambition rather than public purpose.

Did my leadership collapse? No. It was torn down.
