They may have been forced to lower their sights but will cherish a highly competent display which ought really to have yielded more goals. Charlton were fortunate to come across United in one of their generous moods, with Ruud van Nistelrooy still searching for his best form after a knee injury. Otherwise there might have been many more goals to add to Louis Saha's seventh in his 11 appearances as a United player and a second in three matches for Gary Neville, who had waited three years before then to get his name on the scoresheet. Neville's breakaway strike was the outstanding moment of a night which put United to within a point of Chelsea in pursuit of second place in the Premiership and automatic entry to the Champions League rather than the probability of an early-August qualifier. Finishing above Chelsea would also swell United's already bloated resources by another \u00a3545,000 in prize money, although the supporters of England's biggest club are clearly under no illusions that, to Ferguson, coming second is really first last. This was one of those nights when Old Trafford struggled initially to find its voice, and after the talk about bomb plots and tightened security there was the rare sight of empty seats in the Stretford End, contributing to the lowest league crowd here this season. United eventually succeeded in rousing the crowd, despite their manager's selection of David Bellion, Eric Djemba-Djemba and Nicky Butt ahead of Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo and Roy Keane. Ferguson spoke of his players showing \"great confidence\" and Alan Curbishley admitted he had \"feared an avalanche\" in the second half. Saha was the outstanding player and, possibly for the first time, the much-maligned Bellion showed he might yet have the talent to make a belated impact in Manchester. This was only Bellion's fourth league start of the season and United's fans are entitled to ask why the club felt it was worth paying \u00a33m for a player who was deemed good enough to make only three starts when Sunderland were relegated last season. At 21 the Frenchman is of the age when he should no longer be considered, as Ferguson says, \"one for the future\", but the coltish attacker is blessed with a turn of speed to threaten the most accomplished defender. It was from one of these bursts of acceleration that the home side opened the scoring. Curbishley will have been appalled by the negligent manner in which his players backed off Bellion as he ran with the ball, cutting in from the left and advancing menacingly towards goal before slip ping a precise ball into Saha's path. His compatriot had anticipated the pass and ran confidently on to the invitation to score with an angled left-foot drive. Ferguson had recalled Tim Howard in goal ahead of Roy Carroll and Curbishley confessed his dismay that his players had not done more to make it a more challenging comeback. In fact, they could hardly have done less. Once Saha had scored Charlton lost all their attacking enterprise of the first 20 minutes, as if it had es caped them that they could go fourth with a victory. Only Matt Holland and Claus Jensen emerged with any real credit for the visitors and Ferguson's players duly punished them midway through the second half. Neville began the move from inside United's own half, continued his run and when he received the ball back from Saha the full-back capped a flowing move with a precise shot past Dean Kiely. Van Nistelrooy then hit a post, as did Shaun Bartlett for Charlton, and the final score from Monaco capped off a surprisingly jubilant night for United's followers even if, deep down, they must have wished this match had never taken place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
