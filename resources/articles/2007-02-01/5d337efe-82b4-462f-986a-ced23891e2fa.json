What's more, in the past few years it has been on something of a roll. There have been a surprising number of remakes, updates and new productions, culminating in Anthony Minghella's 2005 version at English National Opera. That made a spectacular splash, and transferred last year to the Metropolitan in New York, a house where the taste that counts - that of the blue-haired ladies and mega-rich consorts who bankroll the place - loved it to death. Minghella's take on the opera was partly sold on its \"authenticity\", its gestures towards classical Japanese theatre and Bunraku-style puppets. The most striking image is that of Butterfly's illegitimate son, aptly called Trouble, who is the result of her tragic \"marriage\" to the unscrupulous US naval adventurer Pinkerton. Trouble is played by a puppet manipulated by shadowy but clearly visible puppeteers, giving the scenes in which he appears a strange, emotionally removed atmosphere. The production also boasts enormous mirrors and some spectacular, Busby Berkeley-style fan dances. What could be better than this best of both worlds - a feeling of earnest closeness and respect for the \"exotic\" ambience, but with everything wrapped in a package that's much closer to home? Is it strange, though, that in these anti-racist times, Puccini's \"exotic\" opera still holds the stage? With the benefit of surtitles, we can fully understand the exact terms of Pinkerton's racist sentiments in act one. We find out that Butterfly is supposed to be just 15 years old, that Pinkerton derides her relatives and their religious practices, and that he knows full well their \"marriage\" will only last the brief time before he returns home to find \"a real American wife\". Then there's the end of the opera, when Pinkers returns after three years with that \"real\" wife, is distressed to find Butterfly still devotedly waiting for him and sings a sentimental aria, Addio, Fiorito Asil (Farewell, Flowery Refuge), to demonstrate to us his heartfelt emotion. Oh, and to round off the evening Butterfly kills herself - in \"authentic\" Japanese manner. Many of the more grisly or embarrassing details can - perhaps should - be altered or omitted when we experience Madama Butterfly in the theatre. Pieces that are realised through performance are constantly modified over time, so there's no reason we shouldn't alter one like this to suit our changing views on such matters as racism. But with Butterfly, more would be needed: it's difficult to imagine adjustments that would not cut out huge swathes of the opera. Where to start? How about omitting Pinkerton? The whole idea of the drama is involved - and, worse still, the music is implicated. How can music be racist? Answer: when it's in Madama Butterfly. Take that final scene. Through most of the opera, Puccini has wrapped his heroine in layers of \"exotic\" musical colour; she has a succession of \"primitive\"-sounding pentatonic tunes, spiced up with un-western harmonic progressions and unusual, tinkly orchestration. Her most famous aria, Un Bel Di (One Fine Day), is nothing less than the concentrated essence of all these devices. But then at the close, when Puccini wants to gain maximum impact, he gives her a rolling, western-style melody before her suicide. The message of this stylistic shift is clear. To be really moving, to send us home with a nice damp hankie, Butterfly has to die sounding like one of \"us\"; tinkly pentatonic music just won't do. Ugh. I exaggerate, of course. With attitudes like this, we'd never see performances of Othello, or The Merchant of Venice, or other works of art that offend modern sensibilities. But the fact remains that Butterfly is going to pose special challenges; to offer an uninflected performance, to let the work \"speak for itself\", isn't enough. In this sense, Graham Vick's 1984 ENO production might be thought exemplary. His way around the Butterfly problem was to undercut some of the most famous musical moments with fierce scenic counter-arguments. In the final moments of the opera, the heroine retreats behind her screen and kills herself. Pinkerton appears on stage. But instead of being horrified by seeing her at the point of death, he runs into Trouble, who has wandered out of the room. Oblivious to the tone of the blaring, \"tragic\" melody that Puccini supplies, Pinkerton picks up the boy and saunters off with him, doubtless to introduce his American wife to their new child. Whatever the music might be insisting upon, this production told us that Butterfly's suicide was not, after all, an important death: Pinkerton and his values are the ones that will last. As the sailor proudly announces in act one: \"America for ever!\" Vick, then, made his point about Butterfly, at least some of the time, by arguing with the music, by refusing to passively accept Puccini's musical articulation of this sad tale. That's surely not the only way of approaching the opera, but it may be more responsible than the kimonos-and-lotus-blossom route so many revivals take. So let's be on our guard when we see the next Butterfly float by (amazingly, there are three productions this season alone). Let's by all means enjoy the spectacle; let's be moved by the many musical splendours; but, looking up at those surtitles, let's not give in too easily. \u00b7 Roger Parker teaches music at King's College, London. \u00b7 The Royal Opera House's Madama Butterfly (020-7304 4000) runs until March 10. The Albert Hall's production (020-7589 8212) runs from February 22 to March 11. Welsh National Opera is touring with its version until April 20.
