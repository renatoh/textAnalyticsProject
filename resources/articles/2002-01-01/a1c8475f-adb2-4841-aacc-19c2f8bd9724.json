Having seen City take a two-goal lead, Marcus Bent's deflected strike appeared to have brought the top-flight side back into the game but the First Division leaders had the pace and ability to take advantage of the defensive gaps Ipswich left behind as they pushed forward towards the end. Shaun Goater, who reacted first when Darren Huckerby's shot was parried by Andy Marshall to score with a simple header, sealed the game before Huckerby himself was played through to cap their victory. Ipswich, though they were looking for their first FA Cup win over City, had defeated them three times last season, adding a Worthington Cup win to their league double. But they were without the injured Mark Venus and Jim Magilton and the flu victim Chris Makin, and Finidi George was absent on international duty. International calls also depleted City, who were without Paulo Wanchope and Lucien Mettomo. But the missing cast members hardly detracted from the entertainment. Ipswich, who had won six of their previous seven games, and City, looking for their sixth victory in a row and scoring at almost four goals a game, attacked each other with the confidence of two form sides and it made for an open and entertaining opening half. Huckerby tested Andy Marshall as early as the sixth minute, although Ipswich's response was swift when Bent shot over from Sixto Peralta's cross only two minutes later. Ipswich enjoyed other good chances, particularly when, in the 24th minute, Marcus Stewart played a wonderfully weighted through-ball to Martijn Reuser, who ran clear of the City defence only to clip his shot wide of the left post. Three minutes later they went close again only for Nicky Weaver to save well from Reuser, who was impressing with his runs from the left side of midfield. On points, City had marginally the worse of those opening 45 minutes. But they finished the half the stronger and capped it with a goal. It came in the 43rd minute, after City won a dubious corner on the left when Ali Benarbia's attempted cross struck Niclas Jensen on the backside and bounced out of play. The corner was taken by Benarbia and Eyal Berkovic volleyed it in from the edge of the penalty area. Ipswich scarcely deserved to trail at the interval but they could ruefully reflect that they had wasted the better chances. Galvanised by their goal, City increased the tempo and might have increased their advantage early in the second half. In the 48th minute they had the Ipswich defence gasping in their wake when the persistent and incisive Benarbia put Goater in. The effort was blocked but the ball rebounded to Huckerby, whose shot was cleared off the line by the lunging Titus Bramble. Three minutes later Huckerby shot wide of the right post and then, in the 56th, only a fine last-ditch tackle by Hermann Hreidarsson denied Goater. But it was only a brief reprieve. City soon went further ahead after Ipswich, already looking a little forlorn in the face of their opponents' pace, made a half-hearted attack down the right. Jermaine Wright surrendered possession with a weak pass and Jensen moved the ball swiftly upfield to the ever available Benarbia. His clever through-ball sent Goater in to shoot past Marshall for his 25th goal of the season. Ipswich Town (4-4-2): Marshall; Wilnis, McGreal, Bramble, Hreidarsson; Peralta, Wright, Holland, Reuser; Stewart, Bent. Manchester City (3-5-2): Weaver; Dunne, Wiekens, Pearce; Wright-Phillips, Benarbia, Horlock, Berkovic, Jensen; Goater, Huckerby.
