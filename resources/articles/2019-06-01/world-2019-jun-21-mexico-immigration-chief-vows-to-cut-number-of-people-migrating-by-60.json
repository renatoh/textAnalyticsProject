Trump has given Mexico a 45-day deadline \u2013 which ends on 22 July \u2013 to reduce the flow of undocumented Central American migrants to the United States\u2019 southern border, leaving the Mexican government racing to meet those demands and avert the threat of tariffs. This week \u2013 as Mexican security forces intensified an ongoing crackdown on migrants \u2013 authorities said more than 6,000 members of Mexico\u2019s National Guard had been deployed to \u201cseal off\u201d its southern border with Guatemala. Trump has not publicly specified by how much he expects Mexico to reduce migration in order to escape punitive tariffs. But in an interview with the Mexican newspaper La Raz\u00f3n, Mexico\u2019s newly appointed immigration chief, Francisco Gardu\u00f1o, said he hoped to prevent hundreds of thousands of migrants entering the country each year as part of a \u201ccontainment\u201d drive designed to cut of arrivals by 60%. The influx of so many migrants from Central America, Asia and Africa was \u201cno longer a normal phenomenon\u201d and had to be reduced, Gardu\u00f1o said. The latest US-Mexico crisis erupted at the end of May when Trump unexpectedly announced the imminent introduction of tariffs on Mexican goods \u201cuntil such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP\u201d. Those tariffs \u2013 which experts warned would inflict serious pain on both countries\u2019 economies \u2013 were averted after an agreement was reached for Mexico to reduce the number of migrants reaching the US border and host an increased number of Central Americans while their asylum applications were processed in the US. And since that deal was struck, on 7 July, the Mexican government has been battling to demonstrate it is working hard to rein in migration. On Saturday police and immigration officials reportedly detained 791 migrants heading north towards the US border in lorries \u2013 an operation authorities hailed as \u201cunprecedented\u201d in size. During a visit to Mexico\u2019s southern border on Thursday the president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, said Mexico had given the US an undertaking that there would be \u201cmore control\u201d over migration, while insisting he still favoured a \u201chumanitarian\u201d approach. \u201cThere\u2019s an effort here to convince the United States that they are taking this very seriously and taking immediate action to head-off a potential 45-day crisis,\u201d said Eric Olson, a Mexico specialist from Washington\u2019s Woodrow Wilson Centre. But Olson said it was wrong to imagine Mexico had only decided to start policing its southern border because of Trump\u2019s threats. \u201cThere is a narrative \u2013 at least in the United States and from Donald Trump - that Mexico is doing nothing. That is patently false,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat of tariffs certainly elevates it in terms of urgency. But it\u2019s not like they were like: \u2018Oh my god! I guess we\u2019d better do something!\u2019\u201d In fact, Olson said L\u00f3pez Obrador was facing a growing backlash against migrants from Mexican citizens, as well as Trump. \u201cThere is increasing push back from [Mexican] communities and from the people who are being most affected directly by the growing number of Central Americans and you see that on the two borders, but also along the route.\u201d Observers believe that backlash is likely to intensify as Mexico accepts greater numbers of Central American migrants because of its deal with the US. \u201cMexico is not well-prepared to receive potentially tens of thousands of Central Americans,\u201d in dangerous and over-crowded border cities such as Tijuana, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and Matamoros, Olson said. In an interview with the BBC, the former US ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson, said she also feared Mexico would struggle to feed, house and find jobs for so many arrivals. L\u00f3pez Obrador would have to learn he could not always acquiesce to \u201cthe demands of a bully like Trump\u201d, Jacobson added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
