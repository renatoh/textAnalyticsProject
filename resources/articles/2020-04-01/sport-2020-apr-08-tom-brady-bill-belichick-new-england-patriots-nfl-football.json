In a record-breaking 20-year partnership with head coach Bill Belichick the pair went on to win six Super Bowls together. Some have speculated whether Brady would have enjoyed the same success under a less talented coach than Belichick but during an appearance on Sirius XM\u2019s Howard Stern Show, Brady vehemently denied those claims. \u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty shitty argument actually that people would say that, because again, I can\u2019t do his job, and he can\u2019t do mine,\u201d Brady told Stern on Wednesday. \u201cSo the fact you could say, \u2018Would I be successful without him, the same level of success?\u2019 I don\u2019t believe I would have been. But I feel the same vice versa, as well. \u201cTo have him allowed me to be the best I can be, so I\u2019m grateful for that. I very much believe that he feels the same way about me, because we\u2019ve expressed that to each other.\u201d Brady also denied he left the Patriots because of a deterioration in his relationship with Belichick. Instead, he said \u201cit was just time\u201d to move on to another team when he left the Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last month. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say other than that,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI accomplished everything I could in two decades with an incredible organization, an incredible group of people, and that will never change. No one can ever take that away from me, no one can ever take those experiences or Super Bowl championships away from us.\u201d Belichick is known for his ruthless streak, and has no hesitation in cutting players he believes are past their best. But Brady said he does not see his former coach as disloyal. \u201cI think he has a lot of loyalty. He and I have had a lot of conversations that nobody has ever been privy to, nor should they be, that so many wrong assumptions were made about our relationship or about how he felt about me,\u201d said Brady. \u201cI know genuinely how he feels about me. Now I\u2019m not going to respond to every rumor or assumption that\u2019s made, other than what his responsibility as coach is to get the best player for the team \u2013 not only in the short term but in the long term as well. \u201cI got to the point where I was an older athlete and he\u2019s starting to plan for the future, which is what his responsibility is. I don\u2019t fault him for that. That\u2019s what he should be doing. Not that I would ever coach, but if I was ever in a position of authority, I would understand that too.\u201d The Buccaneers last made the playoffs in the 2007 season but Brady said he was concentrating on the future rather than the past. \u201cI never cared about legacy. I could give a shit about that. I never once, when I was in high school, said, \u2018Man, I can\u2019t wait for what my football legacy looks like.\u2019 That\u2019s just not me. That\u2019s just not my personality,\u201d he said. Brady said he did not make his final decision to leave the Patriots until mid-March, and cried when he informed Patriots owner Robert Kraft that he was leaving. \u201cBut I would say I probably knew before the start of last season that it was my last year,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI knew that our time was coming to an end.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
