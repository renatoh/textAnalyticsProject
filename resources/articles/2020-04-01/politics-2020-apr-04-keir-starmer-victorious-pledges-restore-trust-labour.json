The 57-year-old former shadow Brexit secretary secured more than twice as many votes as the runner-up \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey, the candidate of the Corbyn camp \u2013 and over three times as many as third-placed Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan. By securing 56.2% of the votes of almost half a million Labour members and affiliates, he has emerged with a huge and powerful mandate to lead the party as he chooses, after four-and-a-half years of the Corbyn project, during which two general elections were lost. Angela Rayner won a clear victory to succeed Tom Watson as deputy leader, defeating Dr Rosena Allin-Khan and the left\u2019s candidate, Richard Burgon, after three rounds of voting. In a pre-recorded acceptance speech, Starmer said becoming leader was the \u201chonour and privilege\u201d of his life \u2013 but one that had been bestowed upon him \u201cat a moment like none other in our lifetime\u201d. Coronavirus, he said, had left \u201cour towns and villages deserted\u201d and had reminded us of \u201cwhat really matters, our family, our friends, our relationships. The love we have for one another. Our health.\u201d Starmer will begin appointing his shadow cabinet on Sunday, announcing who will fill the roles of shadow chancellor, shadow foreign secretary, shadow home secretary and shadow health secretary. A spokesman said it would reflect all views and represent all wings of the party: \u201cThe team Keir supports will reflect the breadth of talent across the party and will be a team ready to take on the task of winning the next general election.\u201d Supporters of Starmer hope his success will put pressure on some of the key individuals close to Corbyn, who have remain in senior posts after the disastrous general election defeat last December, to step down. These include Karie Murphy, Corbyn\u2019s former chief of staff, and Jennie Formby, the party\u2019s general secretary, who is also close to the former Labour leader. In a scathing comment on the Labour\u2019s failings of the last few years, Lord (Iain) McNicol, the party\u2019s former general secretary under Starmer\u2019s predecessor, told the Observer he was glad the Corbyn era was finally over. Starmer\u2019s victory was, he said, a chance to recreate a \u201cprofessional\u201d party that could chart a route back to power. \u201cKeir\u2019s election provides the opportunity to rebuild a professional, election-focused party capable of leading the country, something that has been sorely missing over the past few years,\u201d said McNicol. \u201cKeir brings the energy, experience and political astuteness that we desperately need to reinvigorate our party. The sad fact that Labour has the lowest number of MP since the second world war tells you everything you need to know about the Corbyn experiment. I, like thousands in the Labour party, am thankful that that chapter is now closed.\u201d Starmer made clear he would take whatever action was necessary to reform the party, including rooting out the \u201cstain\u201d of antisemitism. \u201cI will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us,\u201d he said. He will begin discussions this week with Jewish leaders. Long-Bailey, Nandy and Corbyn all congratulated Starmer and said they looked forward to working with him. Long-Bailey said: \u201cKeir Starmer will make a brilliant prime minister and I cannot wait to see him in No 10. I will do all I can to make that a reality.\u201d Nandy said that the current coronavirus crisis meant that Labour could rebuild trust fast and become the next government. \u201cThe road back to power is steep, but it does not have to be long,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country is crying for fresh leadership. We start today.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
