The world economy has experienced its longest spell of sustained growth since for more than three decades and confidence in the financial markets that this period of crisis-free expansion will continue indefinitely has seen both share and bond prices rise in tandem. Yet according to a report prepared for the Davos meeting of the World Economic Forum, the world is not only a risky place but getting riskier. A study of 24 risks from a global pandemic to a slump in China or a backlash against globalisation showed that 15 were higher than a year ago. What's more, many of the risks are interconnected; a pandemic, for example, would have a profound effect on the global economy and the global markets. The Davos panel was agreed: the international community is ill-prepared for what could be in store. Doing nothing, however, is easier than doing something - particularly when doing something requires the cooperation of others. One of the panellists in an off-the-record session on managing global risks said it was rather like someone living in an apartment deciding whether to invest in a fire-prevention system. You would be less likely to do so if nobody else in the apartment building was prepared to do the same, since in a fire in another apartment could easily spread to yours. This bias towards inaction tends to accentuated by complacency. This time last year, Davos was awash with stories about the human form of bird flu. In the intervening 12 months, fears of an imminent pandemic have disappeared, at least as far as the media is concerned. The boy who cried wolf syndrome is strong. Yet here's a couple of things to chew on. On the eve of the First World War, the fnancial markets were priced for four more years of peace and prosperity rather than slaughter on the western front. The fact that the global markets today assume the Goldilocks economy will continue for ever doesn't necessarily mean they are right. And investment in risk prevention can pay off. The Netherlands has a sophisticated state of the art system of flood defences that is designed to cope with the sort of disaster than might happen only once in every 10,000 years. The flood defences in New Orleans ahead of Hurricane Katrina were designed to cope with the sort of incident that might happen once in every 50 years and even then weren't maintained properly. Personally, I'd say the Dutch were right, and I'm sure the people of New Orleans would agree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
