The old Evertonian silences the Old Etonian \u2013 a feat he once achieved with a splenetic put-down rather than a mute button \u2013 and messages Adrian Heath about the Minnesota United coach\u2019s impending visit from the United States. Everton\u2019s title-winning team of 1984-85 are being reunited on Monday at a special presentation of a film about their successes under Howard Kendall. Reid\u2019s mood \u2013 and his language \u2013 is transformed by the thought of catching up with old friends and toasting an absent one. \u201cIt\u2019s a word that doesn\u2019t come out among players but it is a love,\u201d says Reid of his former Everton teammates. \u201cThat is a nice part of it. There is a love there and you cannot beat love. Even now when we meet up it is something I look forward to and it was a long, long time ago. But it is still there. We all met in the Hilton before Howard\u2019s funeral and it was emotional. But it was also warm. I was speaking at the funeral so I said I wouldn\u2019t drink. Andy Gray insisted the gaffer would want me to, so of course I did. People go on about the party time but we were dedicated professionals. Nothing got in the way of the games but when we partied, we partied.\u201d Everton had regular cause to celebrate from 1984-87 as two league titles, the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup made their way to Goodison Park. The dramatic rise of Kendall\u2019s young team, one that was in the doldrums and prompting calls for the manager\u2019s dismissal months before reaching the League and FA Cup finals, is covered in Howard\u2019s Way, a captivating film by Rob Sloman. The music and politics of the era feature heavily (including the Everton squad singing Here We Go on Wogan) but it is the bond between the club\u2019s most successful manager and those who played or worked for him that lies at the heart of the film. The former Everton player, coach and manager Colin Harvey\u2019s reflection on the sudden death of Kendall in 2015 is a deeply moving moment. Reid, the PFA Player of the Year in 1985, recalls: \u201cOne of my best moments in football was seeing Howard\u2019s smile as I came down the steps at Wembley with my FA Cup winner\u2019s medal [in 1984]. It was the best smile and one of my abiding memories in football. Five months earlier cushions were getting thrown on the pitch at Goodison Park. Five months. I think he is revered in football history. His achievements as a manager are up there. \u201cPeople say he was one of the best players never to win an England cap. If you go to Bilbao he is still revered there. That is my favourite other European team, not because Howard managed it, although that is part of it, but because of the ethos of the club with its Basque-only players and the tradition that surrounds it. There is something about [Athletic] Bilbao and Howard was the \u2018Mister\u2019 there. \u201cI played in Bilbao in a pre-season game with Man City and it was an honour to play there. I\u2019ve been lucky to travel the world and meet a lot of people through football. At my first club [Bolton] Jimmy Armfield was manager and Nat Lofthouse was his assistant. Howard once took me to lunch with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. That was quite boozy and it was warm. It was always a warm occasion with Howard. But lunch with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, wow. Football has given me a lot and this team, the era that the film captures, was the pinnacle of it. I played in a World Cup and for a Liverpool lad from Huyton that is fantastic, but that team was the pinnacle.\u201d Football provided a glorious release from mass unemployment and political turmoil for the city of Liverpool in the mid-1980s, as the film captures. Reid does not recall the Everton changing room being particularly politically active but several players who emerged from it are unmistakably so today. Neville Southall, \u201cthe best goalkeeper in the world at that time\u201d, says Reid, and Gary Lineker are prominent voices on social media and the former midfielder himself last year addressed a People\u2019s Vote rally where he was scathing of Vote Leave leaders. \u201cThe way I look at it is there is enough in this world for everyone to be looked after,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are wealthy people in the world and I don\u2019t have a problem with that. I made a few quid. Champagne socialist? There is nothing wrong with having champagne and being a socialist. I\u2019m quite proud of it. We have enough resources to look after everyone in this country and, moreover, throughout the world. To me, looking after people is not bad politics. I can\u2019t change it but I can voice an opinion on it and the people who can change it have not done a good job. \u201cI thought the referendum was corrupt. I voted remain and even now we are still discovering what it involves. A referendum is democracy, yes, but we didn\u2019t know the facts or what we were voting for. Anyone who says they did is a liar or Einstein and I don\u2019t see many Einsteins out there. \u201cCarole Cadwalladr [the Observer and Guardian journalist] has got into Cambridge Analytica, Facebook and the financing of it from [US billionaire Robert] Mercer to [Steve] Bannon. She is a hero of mine. I\u2019d love to meet her. There\u2019s a certain Mr [Arron] Banks who is trying to sue her and I hope she has her day in court. I\u2019ve given a few quid to her fundraising page and will continue to do so. She is telling the truth.\u201d Reid\u2019s contempt for Johnson runs much deeper than Brexit. Their paths crossed in 2006 when Reid managed an England Legends team in a charity match at Reading that somehow included the future prime minister. Johnson was editor of the Spectator when it ran the notorious \u201cBigley\u2019s fate\u201d article that accused Liverpudlians of wallowing in \u201ctheir victim status\u201d and repeated the lie that drunken fans shared responsibility for the death of \u201cmore than 50\u201d Liverpool supporters at Hillsborough. There was no charity in Reid\u2019s pre-match team talk. The former Manchester City and Sunderland manager recalls: \u201cHe\u2019d had a go at my city, certain individuals and football fans, so I told him in no uncertain terms what I thought of him.\u201d And that was? \u201cI told him he was a fat, lying twat and a disgrace for what he wrote about my city. Cowardly, he shit himself. He didn\u2019t write it, he sanctioned the piece by [Simon] Heffer, but that was the only part I got wrong. The man is a proven liar and he has refused to apologise in the House of Commons when various MPs have asked him to.\u201d Today Reid is technical director at Wigan Athletic. He admits missing day-to-day management but notes: \u201cI\u2019m glad to be involved. I\u2019m just helping Paul Cook, who is a very good coach and manager. It is a really good club. Joe Royle is football director and his son [Darren] is chairman. We\u2019ve got some good young players. We had Reece James on loan from Chelsea last season, an outstanding footballer. He will play for England. We\u2019ve got some good young footballers at the club. I don\u2019t want to put pressure on the lads by naming them but we have a few in the ranks.\u201d It is 30 years since Reid made the last of his 235 appearances for Everton but his passion for the club remains fierce. It explains why his grandson, Freddie Gilbert, is an Evertonian despite the nine-year-old\u2019s dad supporting Manchester United and why photographs from the 1980s decorate one room in the family home. There is also a print of Reid as a young Bolton midfielder challenging George Best in his Fulham days. \u201cThe best player I\u2019ve seen or played against,\u201d he says of Best. \u201cI liked playing against Robson, Wilkins, Hoddle, Souness and Liam Brady. Outstanding footballers. Was it hard to play against them? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Some of the time. But it was great and I would give everything to be able to play against them lads again.\u201d As for Everton\u2019s current malaise, Reid says: \u201cIt is a struggle. I was at the Man City game recently and some people were clapping. We got beat 3-1. Standards have slipped. Manchester City are an excellent side with a great manager but when people are happy with a 3-1 defeat at home it shows you where we are. It\u2019s not good enough for a great football club. I\u2019m not blaming anyone. It is a fact, and I want us to improve. We have to improve. The FA Cup we won in \u201984 was the catalyst for us. We need some silverware. I would settle for a League Cup or FA Cup at this moment in time. We are not going to win the league but winning a cup might get us on that journey. We can get back to where we were. I wouldn\u2019t live if I didn\u2019t think it was possible. \u201cBut you need a desire and a belief. Forget about it if you haven\u2019t. Good players have to have that. If you\u2019re in a team and the fans expect you to win, then you\u2019re at a good football club. There is nothing wrong with expectation. Is it a heavy load? No. You should want that yourself. \u201cThe modern game is different and the players are all wealthy boys. There is nothing wrong with that. It is more corporate now and the game is big business, big brands all over the world, but it still all comes down to winning football matches. These lads have to win them and show desire. I want to see more. I\u2019ve played for and managed big clubs and Everton is the only place to be. Goodison is going to go but it will still be Everton football club and there will still be the desire to win things. If the new stadium is 50,000 or 60,000 it will be full because there is expectation, desire, hope and passion about Everton. You can never lose that.\u201d Everton\u2019s mediocrity in 2019 will be temporarily forgotten when Reid, Southall, Graeme Sharp and the rest of Kendall\u2019s celebrated team gather at St George\u2019s Hall in Liverpool for one more party. \u201cIf there was one word to describe Howard it would be class,\u201d Reid considers. \u201cAnd really it ends there.\u201d Everton: Howard\u2019s Way, by Rob Sloman, is now on at FACT Liverpool cinema and is released on all home entertainment formats from Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
