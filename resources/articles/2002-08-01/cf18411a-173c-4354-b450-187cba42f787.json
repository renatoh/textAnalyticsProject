Have you noticed them, too? Women the length and breadth of the land are proudly letting the air get to their midriffs. And not just the ones with washboard stomachs, but with all kinds, including pregnant ones. It's reassuring, and inspiring, to see that the grip of the body fascists may be over. Women, some as voluptuous as a Rubens painting, are proudly displaying their most vulnerable part without a care for conventional ideals of the so-called perfect body. This indicates, from a sociological perspective, a more accepting stance towards self and hence towards others. In fact, at a t'ai chi camp I just taught in Wales, one participant, who by her own admission is no Twiggy, spontaneously gave such a graceful and unabashed flesh-wobbling belly-dancing demonstration, it inspired me to write this piece. It suggests that we in the West are slowly changing our understanding of our relationship with the body along more Oriental lines. According to Taoist wisdom, your belly, and particularly your lower belly, is the centre not just of your body, but of your physical universe. In t'ai chi and most other martial arts, you're taught to manoeuvre your body from the lower belly if you want your moves to have grace and power. If you constantly keep a few degrees of awareness just below your navel - at work, rest or play - your words and deeds will ring more true, you'll feel mentally as well as physically more balanced, and your will to succeed in whatever you're doing will increase. Also, because keeping awareness here helps activate kidney energy, which governs sexuality, you'll find yourself feeling and being far more sexy. At first it seems alien, even slightly naughty, to be mindful of your lower belly because we've been trained to locate ourselves, as it were, in the head and chest, but once you start centring yourself further down, you realise how natural it is. The Taoists call it your tantien, meaning, literally, the field of heaven - that point in your body through which the spiritual real, or Tao, finds expression within you. Keeping it relaxed so the energy flows is considered key to health, longevity and enlightenment. On a practical level, it helps reduce discomfort from all kinds of bowel problems. To help get your mind down there, six or seven times a day, gently, purposefully press in with a finger two inches below the navel to produce a pleasant yet pointed ache that radiates throughout the belly. Hold for a minute or so while breathing naturally and tell yourself, 'By pressing here, I unleash a torrent of chi (energy) and become 10 times more powerful, effective and altogether damn sexy immediately!' (or words to that effect). Now visualise a channel running from the tip of the spine over the top of the head down the front of your body to form a loop. Breathe in very gently and visualise the breath travelling up the rear channel to the top of the head. As you breathe out, feel the breath dropping down the front part of the channel and accumulating with quite some pressure around the tantien region. Do this nine times. Think of yourself moving from this point, talking from it, making love from it, generally experiencing life from it. Let heaven move your belly. Even take up belly dancing or t'ai chi to cement the relationship. But a slight note of caution. Only expose it when the weather's warm or you could risk triggering illness. Many Oriental women wear silk sashes around their waist in winter to ensure the heat stays in, so go easy on the jeans with no waistband as autumn draws near. Meantime, I'm predicting a Rubens-look revival on a large scale (excuse the pun). You heard it here first. Dear Barefoot Four months ago a man I'd known for 12 years swept me off my feet. Last week he announced those frightful words (for a woman anyway): 'I don't want to get serious.' That's after months of being serious. He has baggage, he explains: his wife left him, he's still going through his divorce, he has three (adorable) children, he works all hours. We talked and agreed to take things one step at a time. I'm more than happy to do that, but the problem is I've started feeling so insecure, almost waiting for things to go wrong. It should not be like that. I should be enjoying the now because it's damn good. How do I do that and let tomorrow look after itself? Barbara Adams Insecurity can become very addictive. Every time it arises, move into it with your mind - into the physical sensation in the belly, buttocks, back, wherever you find it. As soon as you start to revel in the insecurity, you'll suddenly become very secure. In short, accept the addiction to feeling insecure, and you'll heal it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
