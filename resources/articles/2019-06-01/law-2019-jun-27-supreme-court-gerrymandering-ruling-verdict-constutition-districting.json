Pro-democracy groups had hoped the court would declare partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional and throw out maps in Maryland, where Democratic mapmakers were accused of shrinking Republican influence by distorting district lines; and in North Carolina, where Republican operatives were accused of doing the same to Democrats. But the court has deferred in both cases concluding that authority over district maps rests with state legislatures and the US Congress, and not the supreme court. \u201cPartisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a 5-4 opinion for the majority. The ruling split evenly along ideological lines, with the court\u2019s four liberal-leaning justices dissenting. Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s dissent blasted the court for its diffidence. \u201cFor the first time ever, this court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities,\u201d she wrote. Pro-democracy activists warned that the ruling opened the way for more aggressive gerrymandering. \u201cLetting politicians manipulate voting maps is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse,\u201d the advocacy group Common Cause said in a statement. \u201cWhether they favor Democrats or Republicans, gerrymanders cheat voters.\u201d State-level courts would still be able to hear partisan gerrymandering cases, but the supreme court\u2019s demurral meant that no federal standard to block the practice was likely soon. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a setback in the fight for fair maps around the country,\u201d said Paul Smith, vice-president at the Campaign Legal Center. \u201cWe must redouble our efforts outside the courtroom to keep advancing efforts that put the voices of voters first.\u201d Brian Fallon, executive director of We Demand Justice, tweeted: \u201cThis ruling on gerrymandering is exactly why it is not enough to just win the next election. The supreme court is helping Republicans rig the elections. Democrats need a proactive plan to confront the partisan capture of the court.\u201d Legislative districts in the United States are redrawn after each decennial US census, which captures a picture of how the population of a certain area or state has changed and which can result in the addition or subtraction of districts depending on population fluctuation. Political operatives on both sides have long seized the chance to redraw maps in ways that give one party an advantage either by herding all voters from the opposite party into a single district or by splitting blocs of voters into multiple districts to diminish their influence. A wave of citizen advocacy against gerrymandering in recent elections \u2013 in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, Montana and Washington \u2013 has witnessed the creation of independent redistricting commissions for map-drawing. But rules for changing the practice of redistricting vary by state. \u201cThe fight against partisan gerrymandering is a state fight,\u201d Common Cause said. \u201cStates must set clear rules to prevent elected officials from drawing unfair maps and stripping voters of their voice \u2013 and they have the public support to pass reform.\u201d Michael Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for Justice, said: \u201cChief Justice Roberts\u2019 ruling that no federal court can ever consider claims of extreme and unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering is truly appalling for the long-term health of our democracy. It\u2019s a judicial green light for egregious partisanship, a permission slip for politicians to entrench themselves without fear of judicial intervention.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
