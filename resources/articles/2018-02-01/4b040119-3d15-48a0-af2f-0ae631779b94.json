The London Irish loosehead prop believes that being emotionally overwrought was one reason his team lost so heavily at Twickenham last year, and that, when they welcome England to Murrayfield on Saturday, they will need to find a better equilibrium between passion and rationality than they did in that 61-21 defeat. \u201cIt showed the importance of keeping a lid on things the last time we were down there,\u201d said Reid, who is expected to hold on to the No 1 jersey when Gregor Townsend announces his team at lunchtime today. \u201cLast year we let our emotions get to us a little bit too much and that resulted in them beating us by a hefty amount. \u201cSo it\u2019s a huge thing for us to keep level-minded and keep our heads strong going into the game. It\u2019s a massive game, especially for Scotland, and we\u2019re playing a side that, with Eddie Jones as coach and all the players they\u2019ve got to call on, I think is the best team in the world just now. \u201cThe game against New Zealand [in November] was also a massive game, but we just need to step up to these games and not play the occasion. I just feel that we need to forget about how big a game it is and just go in there with clear heads.\u201d Away from the pitch at least, Reid is invariably able to remain clearheaded and lighthearted, as was shown by his answer to a question about the tests he had to undergo this season after a couple of concussions. \u201cThey identified that I had a brain, so that was quite good. I tried to get a dodgy doctor so he could just sign me off, but there was none of them kicking about so I had to go and see a specialist, who identified that I was totally crazy and that I had to have a couple of months off.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
