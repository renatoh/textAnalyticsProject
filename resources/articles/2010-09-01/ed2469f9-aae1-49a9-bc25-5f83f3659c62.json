It drapes the Champions League match at Old Trafford in tradition and diverts attention towards the personal histories of two friends, the former Rangers centre-forward who is in charge at Manchester United and the Ibrox manager, Walter Smith. All the same, camaraderie cannot conceal the growing distance between the people who hold the respective posts. Rangers have been good enough to land the Scottish Premier League in each of the past two seasons but the financial position is excruciating for a club in their market. In the spring of this year the debt was put at \u00a331m. \"Walter has galvanised them,\" said Sir Alex Ferguson. \"He is making a silk purse out of a sow's ear. It has been an absolutely phenomenal performance.\" The United manager was under an obligation to make this evening's fixture sound like a potential ordeal and snatched at the opportunity to bring up Hercules' victory at Barcelona on Saturday as proof of football's unpredictability. Smith's acumen received a mention as well. \"I can almost see that little brain working at the moment,\" said Ferguson. Even so, the one footballer signed by Rangers for a significant sum since 2008 has been the \u00a34m Nikica Jelavic, a Croatia forward who became ineligible for the Champions League when his previous club Rapid Vienna emerged from the qualifiers for the Europa League. There is no mystery to the economic factors that hamper Celtic and Rangers. Grand ambitions are now funded either by the sort of television deals to be found in major markets such as England and Spain or by the subsidies of a besotted proprietor. Even the lesser European tournament does not escape predictability. The Europa League and its forerunner, the Uefa Cup, also found their way into moneyed hands. Four of the last seven finals have been won by Spanish clubs. On the other occasions wealthy teams have prevailed. Zenit St Petersburg, who beat Rangers in the 2008 Uefa Cup final, enjoy the backing of Gazprom, the world's largest extractor of natural gas. It was quite a feat for Smith's team even to be taking part in such an event two years ago. Disadvantages, however, suit his phlegmatic nature and Rangers are more at ease when there is no obligation to dominate. The side, for instance, was well-beaten in all three Champions League group games at Ibrox last season yet drew two of the away matches. If Smith looks at ease in the midst of handicaps, it has much to do with his background. He was at Jim McLean's right hand when the latter got Dundee United to the Uefa Cup final in 1987. The year before Smith had been Ferguson's assistant when the national team was at the World Cup finals. It was a rare period of diversity and Aberdeen, under Ferguson's command, were so potent that they seized the 1983 Cup-Winners' Cup by beating Real Madrid. Leading sides north of the border have had shining moments more recently. Gordon Strachan, who deserved far more appreciation than he was accorded at Celtic, led the club astutely to the last 16 of the Champions League in 2006-07 and the following season. His side first took that step by beating Manchester United in Glasgow. Even so, Celtic and Rangers find themselves lacking the means to employ the standard of player who served them not so long ago. Brian Laudrup spent four years at Ibrox and his time overlapped with that of Henrik Larsson, who stayed with Celtic for seven seasons. Each was well-rewarded but the sums players of that calibre can now command would not be feasible for either club. The obvious solution, from the Old Firm's perspective, is a move into the Premier League and Celtic's principal shareholder Dermot Desmond has been pursuing the objective for several years. However, it is quite a task to persuade English clubs that they should commit themselves to a realignment that would surely lead to strife with Uefa when the status quo serves them well enough. As matters stand, Scottish sides generate interest as best they can. While Rangers have trophies, Celtic have a project. Their manager, Neil Lennon, has more or less assembled a new team. The emphasis has been on unfamiliar markets and, for instance, the Honduras left-back Emilio Izaguirre and Baram Kayal, an Israeli midfielder, look astute signings at a combined cost of less than \u00a32m. Celtic were bundled out of both Champions League and Europa League qualifiers while the squad was under development. Even so, they and Rangers are all too stable in the domestic arena. Both have perfect records that already put them four points clear. Aberdeen were champions in 1985, but the title has gone to Celtic or Rangers in each of the subsequent 25 years. This is not even to the long-term advantage of the Glasgow clubs, who would benefit from the stimulation of a real challenge. In practice, no such upsurge is feasible. Dundee United and Aberdeen were once termed the \"New Firm\" but the title was awarded largely out of wishful thinking and its relevance soon faded. The sides commanded an attendance of 9,793 at Tannadice on Saturday and although that was a healthy turn-out it still fell 5000 short of capacity. Rangers step on to a great stage tonight but it may be quite a while before a Scottish club has more than a walk-on part in the grand theatre of European football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
