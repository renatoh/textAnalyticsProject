Revenues in the six months to March were up 5% on last year, reflecting higher ticket prices and the early Easter, but the early holidays meant third-quarter revenues would suffer, the company said. It benefited from financial restructuring as losses fell to \u20ac80.9m (\u00a355m) from \u20ac109m in the same period last year. Spending by visitors was up by 6%, but attendance at the parks rose only slightly to 5.7 million, from 5.6 million in the previous six months. Revenues from hotels fell by 1%, as guests' spending fell. The future of the company, which nearly went bankrupt last year, depends on improving faltering visitor numbers. EuroDisney is starting to expand, introducing new attractions over several years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
