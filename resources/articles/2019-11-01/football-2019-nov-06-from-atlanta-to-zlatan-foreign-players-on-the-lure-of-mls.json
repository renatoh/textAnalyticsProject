For many, crossing the Atlantic to ply their trade in the US requires a leap of faith, with MLS, despite its steady growth in interest and viewership, still vying for recognition among the elite leagues of Europe. What is the perception of MLS in your home country? Michael Mancienne (New England Revolution, English): \u201cI feel like people think it\u2019s not the best league \u2013 they underestimate it. I\u2019ll be honest, I did as well before I came over. But the standard is really, really good. There are a lot of good players in the league and a lot of good teams.\u201d Nedum Onuoha (Real Salt Lake, English): \u201cIt\u2019s quite a tricky thing to actually be able to see because of the time zones. You won\u2019t get to see many games live, especially if they\u2019re on the west coast. You get highlights but you can only really get a feel from that. I think the fact Rooney came over to the east meant there was more coverage of the highlights.\u201d Anton Tinnerholm (New York City FC, Swedish): \u201cThe popularity of the league is growing, thanks to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, of course. Now you can see every single game, either with Swedish or American commentators. But it\u2019s hard to see normal people staying up until the middle of the night, watching games and then going to work the next day. That\u2019s the biggest issue for the league, compared to European leagues you can watch in the evenings.\u201d How do you think MLS teams would fare in your home country? Mancienne: \u201cI think some of the better teams could be in the Premier League but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be a top-six team or anything like that. I think mid-to-bottom table. There is a lot of quality here. There are a lot of South American players I\u2019d never even heard of before I came here who are really good players.\u201d Onuoha: \u201cI think they\u2019d do well. But to exist as a team within England and a lot of other European leagues, you have to be defensive first and attacking second. Over here, the emphasis is put on attacking.\u201d Reto Ziegler (FC Dallas, Swiss): \u201cThey would fight with Young Boys and Basel for the Championship, for sure. It\u2019s not easy to play here. If you come here thinking you\u2019re going on a vacation, you\u2019re making a big mistake. You have to deserve your spot, week in, week out. There are a lot of young players [in MLS] and, physically, they are on top. Tactically, we can improve. They are doing really well now with the academies. It\u2019s getting really tough to play here.\u201d Gary Mackay-Steven (New York City FC, Scottish): \u201cI think they would do really well. There is such a wide range of styles and tactics different teams play; some are technical and some are physical. There are so many different strengths. Celtic have been playing to such a high standard over the last years, but I\u2019m sure a lot of teams from over here would give Scottish teams a good game and do really well.\u201d Tinnerholm: \u201cThis is a step up from the Swedish league. The best teams here are better than the best teams in Sweden. It\u2019s hard to compare but there are some players in this league who are so much better than the best players in Sweden. In Sweden, you don\u2019t have players like Maxi Morales, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Carlos Vela, Josef Martinez. We have bigger stars here. The gap between the best players and the players 17th, 18th [in the squad] is bigger here than back home in Sweden.\u201d How has your transition to life in North America been? Onuoha: \u201cIt\u2019s a foreign country but they speak the same language, that definitely goes a long way. The little things you have to learn \u2013 like how you file your taxes and other real-world issues \u2013 are made easier because you can look into it and understand it. It\u2019s not really a harsh adjustment. My kids are loving it and it\u2019s a great place to be. I didn\u2019t know much about Salt Lake City, but I\u2019ve been here just over a year now and it has ended up being the perfect place for me and my family. It\u2019s a beautiful place, all geared around being outdoors, and the people are really friendly.\u201d Ziegler: \u201cFor me, the hardest thing is the traveling. We are lucky because Dallas is almost in the middle of the country, so it\u2019s not too bad. There are a few flights that are close to four hours. This is the thing I\u2019ve had to adapt to. You travel a lot and spend a lot of time in airports. An airport isn\u2019t the best place to recover, but you get used to that.\u201d Mackay-Steven: \u201cI must admit, it was quite tough to start with. I came over off the back of an offseason in Scotland when the team was in the middle of their season. I was trying to get fit while playing important games. Plus the weather is so warm, and travel to away games might see you go across a few different time zones and different climates. Certainly, it was a little bit tough to start with, before I felt fit and got my bearings. But it\u2019s been enjoyable throughout.\u201d Mancienne: \u201cWhen I was by myself it was tough because I didn\u2019t have any family or friends over here. Now that they\u2019re over here it\u2019s helped me adjust and we love life here. I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m not the biggest American sports fan. We\u2019ve always got American football on in the changing room and I haven\u2019t got a clue what\u2019s going on.\u201d Tinnerholm: \u201cThe away games in Sweden are mostly a three- or four-hour bus ride, then we go home after the game. Here, every away game is like an adventure. I do like it; either you dislike everything or you treat it like an adventure.\u201d What\u2019s the best thing about playing in MLS? Onuoha: \u201cI always enjoy traveling. In the time I spend here, I\u2019ll get to travel to all the different cities in America which have MLS teams, which is a lot of places I wouldn\u2019t usually go if I had a one-week or two-week holiday \u2013 going to Houston or Cincinnati, places like this. Most of the trips for away games will take up two or three days, so there\u2019s a lot of time to go and see the city you\u2019re in. I\u2019m at a stage in my life where I want to go and see things.\u201d Ziegler: \u201cThe best thing, for me, is the stadiums they are building or they have already built. I\u2019m not a big fan of artificial turf, the synthetic grass. But when you can play in Atlanta, in these amazing stadiums full of fans, it\u2019s something special. It reminds me of big games in England or in Italy. They have a few teams building stadiums right now. I think Miami, Austin and St Louis are all building, they want to invest. Maybe I\u2019m in MLS too early, I don\u2019t know, but in the future it\u2019s going to be a great, great league.\u201d Mackay-Steven: \u201cThe best thing, personally, is playing in New York and playing at Yankee Stadium, and living in New York. We\u2019ve got a great team \u2013 we won the Eastern Conference \u2013 so confidence is high. And playing home games in front of our crowds, that are very passionate, it\u2019s great. That\u2019s the highlight for me.\u201d Mancienne: \u201cFor me, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the lifestyle. I\u2019ve been on holiday to America, to places like LA, Miami and Las Vegas, but now I\u2019ve been to places I probably never would have gone to. I\u2019m getting to see the country a little bit more.\u201d Tinnerholm: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the quality of the players you\u2019re facing every day \u2013 it\u2019s top quality, especially with the designated player rule [which allows each MLS franchise to sign up to three players that are considered outside the team\u2019s salary cap]. As a right-back, I mostly face a striker or a winger, and most teams\u2019 DPs are strikers or wingers, so I face a lot of good players.\u201d Could you see yourself staying in North America when you retire? Onuoha: \u201cI have a contract here and I want to finish my career here. But having kids, I want to go back home and share those kids with family. I will go back regardless of how much fun we\u2019re having here; that was always my plan. But I know people who, if they were living the life I\u2019m living here, would have no desire to go back whatsoever. The experience has been absolutely incredible. It has been one of the best years of my life and career so far.\u201d Ziegler: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me now to think about that. Right now, I have one more year left in MLS \u2013 my contract ends December 2020. I have to deserve another contract and I have to talk with my wife, but why not?\u201d Mackay-Steven: \u201cI\u2019d definitely be open to it. I\u2019m loving every minute now. I\u2019m settled and happy here, especially the place I\u2019m at [in New York]. There\u2019s everything I want on my doorstep, and I\u2019m just embracing it all. I certainly could see myself living here, for sure.\u201d Mancienne: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I do love it over here but I feel like my home is back in England. That\u2019s where all my family and friends are. I know my partner misses her family and friends, so we\u2019ll definitely be back in England.\u201d Tinnerholm: \u201cWhen I moved here, my first thought was moving back to Sweden. Now, I\u2019m not too sure what will happen. I recently signed a multi-year extension, so I\u2019m going to be here for a couple of years. And we\u2019re expecting a daughter in November; she\u2019s going to be born and raised here. I don\u2019t have any problem staying here. I miss my family and friends a lot but they come and visit us here. It\u2019s also up to my wife \u2013 she has sacrificed a lot \u2013 but we\u2019re open to staying.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
