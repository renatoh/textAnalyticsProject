It was a victory built around a rollicking, wonderfully controlled 153 from Aaron Finch; and a performance that illuminated both the extreme strengths and the lurking weakness of the latest edition of the Australian machine. Most obvious were the strengths. Finch and Mitchell Starc are key to this. Late in the day Starc would once again prove too much for the lower middle order. And nobody does this quite like Starc, a bowler whose skill it is to reduce this complex game to its primary note of ball hitting stumps; and who is a truly fearsome sight, bounding in at 6ft 5in then sending down those toenail-ripping full balls, or the lifter past the nose with no obvious change of approach or extra effort. But first there was Finch, who opened the innings, made 153 off 132 balls, and at times took the breath away. In the 40th over, with 129 already against his name, Finch did something extraordinary. It wasn\u2019t the fact he hit Thisara Perera for six over square leg. Finch is currently the leading six-hitter in the World Cup, a man who breakfasts, lunches and midnight snacks off persevering mid-range international medium-fast bowlers. It was the way he did it. This wasn\u2019t a pull shot, it was a kind of lift, a straight arm swivel off an otherwise blameless delivery. The ball flew startlingly flat and hard into the crowd, like one of those fast-banking objects the US airforce occasionally picks up barrelling over the Mojave desert. It was a bad moment for the ball generally, which appeared later in TV close-ups looking shredded and unhappy. As did Sri Lanka\u2019s bowlers on the wrong end of an innings that began in the classic style of this World Cup with a process of platform-building. Sri Lanka had won the toss at 10am and sent Australia in to bat on a sullen south London morning. They started carefully. At 33 without loss after seven overs something shifted, helped by a trio of Sri Lankan fumbles in the field. The worst was Thisara Perera\u2019s attempt to stop a booming off-drive from Finch, Perera going down like a groaning municipal coal chimney collapsed by a tonne of dynamite. David Warner was back to his watchful mode here. At his best he spreads his weight and whams the spinners away over midwicket like a man spanking golf balls into the ocean off a sand dune. Here he flinched and crouched back and missed a ball that came on with the arm, bowled by Dhananjaya de Silva for 25 off 41 balls. Finch sat in and absorbed the pressure of the day. Nine overs went without a boundary. Usman Khawaja departed for an elegantly fiddly 10. The appearance of Steve Smith seemed to liberate Finch. The 28th over saw De Silva dumped over long-on for successive sixes, the second a beautiful, easy short-arm lift on to the black tarpaulin in front of the press box to take Finch to 89. Smith played with a feisty sense of purpose for his 73 off 59 balls. On 30 he slapped Lasith Malinga over midwicket with the kind of pure, clean flick that tells you the ball has found the deepest, tightest grains of that pinkish slab of willow. At the other end Finch\u2019s 13th six of the tournament got him to his hundred off 97 balls. The 150 came up with another clip over midwicket. He went with seven overs left, skying a slower ball from Isuru Udana to cover. Glenn Maxwell drove Australia forward to an imposing 334, batting like a genius-level under-10, looking to take every ball over the leg side, and hitting with ungainly precision. When he got to 30 off 13 balls you half expected Maxwell to retire and go and have a biscuit. Sri Lanka\u2019s reply began with some elan, Kusal Perera and Dimuth Karunaratne taking 30 off the first four overs. For a while the ball skittered to all parts of the outfield. Starc came off after two overs. This is another gift from T20. Captains react quickly. The best bowlers have the skills to come back at any stage and affect the game. The feisty Perera went to fifty off 31 balls before Starc returned and pinged back the base of his stumps. That was pretty much that for a chase that kept on twitching but never really looked like reeling Australia in. Sri Lanka have now won once in five games. Australia top the table and have their gun players firing. It isn\u2019t hard to see how they hope to win this World Cup. Finch, Warner and Smith is, as they say on Channel Nine, a champion top order. Add in Starc and Pat Cummins and this is a team weighted with A-list qualities at the top end. Is also isn\u2019t hard to see how they might lose it, too. The batting lineup is unbalanced. Khawaja continues to skulk reproachfully around the top six like the ghost of Banquo. Australia\u2019s bowling also divides up into two sections. On the one hand Starc and Cummins. On the other: the others. Is there really no better seam and swing bowling option than the fast-medium blah of Jason Behrendorff? Who tries to win a World Cup without a specialist spin bowler? Australia could yet end up winning but they will do so with one hand tied behind their backs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
