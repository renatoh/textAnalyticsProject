In a letter to the Guardian, the heads of seven Nordic public service broadcasters urged the UK to protect the BBC\u2019s independence, saying that a diminished BBC would risk reducing Britain\u2019s standing in the world. They also noted that many foreign broadcasters \u2013 including their own \u2013 had used it as a template. \u201cNo creative organisation in the world is as well known and has such a reputation for quality as the BBC. That reputation reflects on Britain as a whole. Every day, all over the world, on all continents, the BBC\u2019s programmes and services inform, educate and entertain millions of people. \u201cThe international standing of the BBC would be unthinkable without a broad remit at home. Diminishing the BBC at home risks diminishing Britain abroad,\u201d they wrote. The letter was written in response to growing concern over the government\u2019s plans for the BBC, which have already seen it told to take on the \u00a3700m cost of funding free licence fees for the over 75s. The BBC has said that the government\u2019s green paper on its future which questions the universal remit of the corporation, appears to \u201cherald a much diminished, less popular BBC\u201d. Signatories to the letter included Cilla Benk\u00f6, Hanna Stj\u00e4rne and Christel Tholse Willers, the director generals of Sweden\u2019s three public service broadcasters. They were joined by Maria R\u00f8rbye R\u00f8nn and Thor Gjermund Eriksen, the heads of public media organisations in Denmark and Norway, respectively. The other signatories were public service broadcaster director generals Lauri Kivinen of Finland and Magn\u00fas Geir \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson of Iceland. In the letter, they wrote: \u201cThe idea of public service broadcasting was born in Britain. Free from political and commercial interests, its main pillar is independence and the idea of putting citizens first. \u201cLike the BBC in Britain, we Nordic public service broadcasters all rank among the most trusted media companies in our own countries, thanks to our independence. The BBC\u2019s independence comes from its institutional history and culture as well as from its regulatory structure, including how remit and funding decisions are made. \u201cChanges to the system should serve to strengthen the independence of the broadcaster, not weaken it. This is especially important in the case of the UK, as the British model is often viewed as a model for how the media should be organised in new democracies.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian, Benk\u00f6, who is also a European Broadcasting Union board member, said she and her colleagues were concerned about the discussions around BBC funding. \u201cTrust is a key word for a public service broadcaster. The funding has to be stable and long term and as far away from political influence as possible. There should be an open debate about it and, if any further changes are proposed, they should be put forward to the entire parliament for an agreement. \u201cWe are also concerned about proposals that would hamper the possibility for the BBC to develop in all areas. A public service broadcaster has to be available to everyone, including to those who choose to consume media solely online or via social media.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
