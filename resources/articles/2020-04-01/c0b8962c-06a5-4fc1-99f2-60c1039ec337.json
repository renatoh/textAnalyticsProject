Santa Clara county had 1,094 confirmed cases of Covid-19 at the time the study was carried out, but antibody tests suggest that between 48,000 and 81,000 people had been infected by early April, most of whom did not develop symptoms. But even those high figures mean that within the whole population of the county, only 3% have been infected and have antibodies to the virus. A study in the Netherlands of 7,000 blood donors also found that just 3% had antibodies. Van Kerkhove said they needed to look carefully at the way the studies were being carried out. \u201cA number of studies we are aware of in pre-print have suggested that small proportions of the population [have antibodies],\u201d she said. These were \u201cin single digits, up to 14% in Germany and France\u201d. \u201cIt is really important to understand how the studies were done.\u201d That would include asking how they found the people to test. Was it at random or were they blood donors, who tend to be healthy adults? They would also need to look at how well the blood tests were performed. \u201cWe are working with a number of countries carrying out these serology studies,\u201d she added. The WHO-supported studies would use robust methods and the tests would be validated for accuracy. The hope will be that people who have had Covid-19 will be able to resume their lives. But Van Kerkhove last week said that even if tests showed a person had antibodies, it did not prove that they were immune. \u201cThere are a lot of countries that are suggesting using rapid diagnostic serological tests to be able to capture what they think will be a measure of immunity,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, we have no evidence that the use of a serological test can show that an individual has immunity or is protected from reinfection.\u201d \u2022 The headline and opening paragraph of this article were amended on 20 April 2020 to clarify that the 2%-3% figure cited by the WHO referred to the population as a whole."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
