The question, specifically framed around the allegations against former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, came in an interview with USA Today. Ailes has been accused of sexual harassment by over 20 women since former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit against him on 6 July. Most recently, Laurie Luhn, a former Fox News booker, has accused Ailes of maintaining a sexually coercive relationship with her. Ailes has denied all the allegations. Trump defended Ailes, a longtime friend, in an interview with Chuck Todd on Meet the Press on 24 July. The Republican nominee said of the allegations: \u201cAll of a sudden they\u2019re saying these horrible things about him. It\u2019s very sad. Because he\u2019s a very good person. I\u2019ve always found him to be just a very, very good person. And by the way, a very, very talented person. Look what he\u2019s done. So I feel very badly.\u201d The Republican nominee has made controversial comments about women in the past. Last August, Trump said about Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly that the news anchor \u201chad blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever\u201d, while questioning him during the first presidential debate in what was widely considered a reference to menstruation. Trump denied this. The Republican nominee also made fun of the appearance of former rival Carly Fiorina, rated the physical attractiveness of model Heidi Klum in an interview with the New York Times and said that women who have abortions should receive \u201csome sort of punishment\u201d. He quickly reversed himself on the latter statement. A CNN/ORC poll released on Monday showed Trump trailing Clinton by a margin of 57% to 34% among female voters. Trump\u2019s statement on sexual harassment comes as the Republican nominee is trying to swerve past the controversy over his criticism of a Muslim couple whose son was killed in Iraq, claiming instead that he fears the election \u201cis going to be rigged\u201d. At his first campaign stop since he berated Khizr and Ghazala Khan, who spoke on Thursday at the Democratic national convention, Trump began his remarks by contrasting his support for war veterans with that of rival Hillary Clinton, before veering off to express concern that the presidential election will not be run fairly. He told supporters: \u201cHillary will be nothing more than four more years of Obama. Four more years of Isis. Four more years of a military that\u2019s being depleted and not taking care of our vets. She said a few months ago our vets are being taken care of just fine. She said no, no, it\u2019s over-exaggerated.\u201d The Republican nominee\u2019s comments about the Khans have triggered a bipartisan backlash from Barack Obama, Senator John McCain and military families. During the Columbus event, Trump alleged he felt the Democrats had fixed their primary system so Clinton could defeat Bernie Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest,\u201d he said. He claimed that he hears \u201cmore and more\u201d that the poll may not be free and fair. It is unprecedented in modern American history for a presidential candidate to cast doubt on the integrity of the electoral process in this manner. Trump, who has slipped behind in Clinton in polls following last week\u2019s Democratic convention, also criticised the media for being biased against him and defended his weekend comments where he claimed Russia \u201cis not going into the Ukraine\u201d. Since 2014, Russia has occupied the Crimea peninsula and a significant portion of eastern Ukraine. Crimea had been annexed during Obama\u2019s watch in 2014, he said. \u201cDo you want to have world war three to get it back? \u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we actually got along with Russia? Am I wrong in saying that? Wouldn\u2019t it be great? Russia, like us, has nuclear weapons, folks. \u201cIt would be really nice if we got along with Russia and others that we don\u2019t get along with right now. And wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we teamed up with Russia and others, including surrounding states and maybe Nato, and we knocked the hell out of Isis and got rid of these people?\u201d Trump said Ohio had lost one in three manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s. \u201cThey call it the rust belt for a reason, because everything\u2019s rusting and rotting,\u201d he said. The candidate also complained bitterly that a fire marshal had restricted access to the event to a thousand people, describing it as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. He said: \u201cThey turned away thousands of people \u2013 look at the size of this place \u2013 they turned away thousands. Is the mayor a Democrat? Is he a Democrat? That\u2019s what I heard. You oughta be ashamed of him. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad. You know, it shouldn\u2019t be so much about politics \u2026 It\u2019s really politics at its lowest. The mayor of Columbus is Democrat Andrew Ginther."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
