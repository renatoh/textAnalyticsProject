Their memorable toppling of Newcastle has been followed by a decent run of results. Reading are also showing impressive form \u2013 with striker Shane Long being the key man. Brian McDermott's team, quarter-finalists last year, play some of the prettiest football in the Championship. Stevenage need to make this a physical battle to stand a chance.
