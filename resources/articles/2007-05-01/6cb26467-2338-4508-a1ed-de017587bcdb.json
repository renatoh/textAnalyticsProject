Although he has been the arbiter of many aspects of domestic policy from his seat in the Treasury, there have been big areas of the public canvas in which he has either been silent, or merely hinted at disagreements with Mr Blair. Yesterday, freed for first time from 14 years in the shadow of Tony Blair, he set out in his speech more of his ideas and revealed new priorities in at least six different areas. Many seemed designed to rub out Mr Blair's negatives. \"One of my first acts as prime minister would be to restore power to parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy.\" He has promised to give parliament full powers over decisions of peace and war. He also proposed giving MPs powers over big public appointments, in the same way that US Congress holds hearings on key public bodies, such as regulatory chairmen. He also promised a new ministerial code of conduct, so that it is about more than expenses, and instead a duty to inform parliament. He also hinted at a wider programme of constitutional reform, saying he will be vigilant in \"ensuring hard-won liberties are at all times upheld without relenting in our attack on terrorism\". Mr Brown may be thinking of a constitutional convention on the Scottish model, but probably not a bill of rights, or a written constitution, something already being examined by the Tories. Jack Straw, his campaign manager, said it was time to strike a new balance between liberty and security. It looks as if he will develop the concept of British citizenship as a way of winning hearts and minds, and strengthening cohesion. \"I have never believed presentation should be a substitute for policy. I do not believe politics is about celebrity.\" Mr Brown is not a performer in the same way as Mr Blair. His strength lies in detail and policy, but the speech showed he intended to tackle his dour image. He tried to remove any hint of arrogance by promising to meet people in every part of the country, to learn in advance of publishing the Queen's Speech as well as publishing a draft legislative programme to inform consultation. Recently branded as Stalinist by one of Britain's senior civil servants, he repeatedly promised he would be listening and learning. He also spoke of wanting to hear solutions from ordinary people, suggesting that he will use new forms of consulation such as local referendums, citizens' initiatives and more local police consultations. \"A priority for the coming months will be the NHS. In advance of the spending review in the autumn, I will meet with those on the frontline of the NHS, patients and staff, as we shape the next stages of our plans for our health service.\" Mr Brown tried to strike a balance - defending the use of the private sector to expand NHS capacity, but recognising that NHS reforms have left staff demoralised. He is likely to talk less about choice in the NHS and more about individual control, a subtle change of language. He will look to see if there is any aspect of the reform programme that can be shelved, such as the closure of accident and emergency units. A further alternative is an independent board for the NHS, something that has been backed by the British Medical Association, but rejected by Mr Blair. Mr Brown is likely to dismiss the current health secretary Patricia Hewitt. He appeared to rule out any caps on incomes of the rich, saying: \"People at the very top are doing a lot better in every country in the world in a global economy.\" He said the task of a national government was to raise the income of the poorest as the best way of reducing inequality. \"Education is my passion.\" He hinted at his interest in the lost childhood debate, an issue already being taken up by the Conservatives, asking what we can do together about the far greater pressures on children that risk eroding childhood. He gave no clear endorsement of city academies, a Blair favourite. \"With house prices rising, families want more affordable housing.\" The cost of home ownership is rapidly becoming the pre-eminent domestic issue. The government has six pilots designed to see if councils can keep all their rents from council properties rather than see them recycled into the housing revenue account, so making it easier for councils ot build more property. \"There are too many people in Iraq who don't have a stake in the economic future of the country, too many people unemployed, too many people who are not seeing services developed in the way they want to see them developed, and therefore too many people who don't feel the loyalty to the regime that is possible in situations where you are investing in people's livelihoods and you are showing them that peace is a way to prosperity.\" Mr Brown placed greater emphasis on economic reconstruction and winning hearts and minds, as opposed to military intervention. He promised to visit the Middle East and consult with the armed forces on future military strategy in Iraq. He did not promise an immediate withdrawal, saying: \"We will keep our obligation to the Iraqi people under UN resolutions.\" He did not mention an inquiry into Iraq, but admitted mistakes had been made."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
