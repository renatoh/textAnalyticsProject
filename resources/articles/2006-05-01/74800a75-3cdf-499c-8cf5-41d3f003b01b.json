In the future when I was entertaining murderous thoughts about him, I would sometimes wish that I had heeded them. I longed to work in the film industry. My application for a junior assistant position with a major London talent agency was part of a CV offensive to ward off fears about what to do when I finished my indulgent three-year degree course in scriptwriting. Some weeks later, to my surprise, I received a telephone call from them inviting me for an interview. The first person I met was the person whose job I would be taking over. She struggled to explain my duties, using terms I did not then understand, such as \"booking notices\" and \"deal memos\". However, she made it clear that my future boss had a notorious temper and that his office was known as a fraught environment. She asked how I responded to stress. I assured her I could cope. Then it was time to go one-to-one with the boss. We went for a walk. He needed to link up two clients who, despite one of them being a recognisable Oscar-winning actor, had been unable to find each other at a Soho eaterie nearby. As we walked, he bellowed into his mobile phone at the nice girl by whom I had just been gently interviewed. \"Which side of Old Compton Street? The north side or the south side?\" Silence. He was taut with exasperation. \"It's such a simple fucking question, sweetheart, north or south?\" I winced. We walked on. \"In future,\" he said to her, his voice softening significantly, \"just so you know, that's the north side.\" After actor and writer were united in the cafe, my future boss asked me why I wanted to work for him so soon after graduation. \"I think you're mad. Don't you want to travel?\" he said. \"No,\" I replied. He asked me when I could start. I explained that I was supposed to be celebrating my 21st birthday over a few days in New York at the beginning of June but I was available immediately afterwards. \"No,\" he said. \"I need you to start by the first of June at the latest.\" It felt like a final test. As would come to be the pattern between us, I obeyed unflinchingly. I'm not sure if anybody noticed me on my first day. The office was busy. The phones rang continually, the fax machine was constantly in use, deliveries and messages piled up. I didn't know how to transfer calls, use a fax machine or a photocopier. I needed to be taught everything. Yet the first thing that got me into trouble was something I should have mastered in primary school. \"Come here Alison, I want to show you something.\" I approached fearlessly. I had done very little; ergo, I could have done little wrong. \"What's this?\" \"It's a phone message,\" I said. He gave me a withering look and stabbed his pen at the message I had taken. \"This!\" I honestly didn't know what he was talking about. \"A phone number?\" \"This!\" he said, the pitch of his voice ascending. \"This! This! This!\" The tip of his pen pierced the slip of paper and it tore. He scratched at the message circling the digit seven, pressing down so hard that the note was soon in tatters. \"A seven?\" I didn't get it. \"That's not a seven,\" he said. \"This is a seven, OK?\" And he scored a cross through my uncrossed seven. I haven't written an uncrossed seven since. I had to learn quickly if I wanted to survive. Not only penmanship and photocopiers, but how to make sure that his lunch order (canned tuna on dry lettuce) came exactly how he wanted it; how paperclips \"didn't exist in his world\"; how to get his attention for more than three minutes; how to work an 80-hour week without complaining; and how to be open about mistakes. He would flip into a fury over a missed opportunity but if major cock-ups occurred he would step up and take responsibility, shielding his staff from the consequences and earning our respect and gratitude. As the weeks went by I learned plenty from my colleagues. There was a rumour that the dents in the filing cabinet had been made by his fist, that he had once slammed the door so hard a glass partition wall had fallen down, that he had pushed the disconnect button with such force he had broken his finger. It was easy to believe all these things. I discovered that I cry when I am stressed and it felt like I was always crying. On Friday nights, when the assistants raided the stash of champagne that we sent out on opening nights and first shoot days, there was a clear split between those who thought he was a power-crazed lunatic and those who wouldn't hear a bad word said against him. Those of us who had worked directly under my first boss had unswerving loyalty. Those who knew him by reputation thought he was a bully. He was, but at the same time he was a rousing teacher who truly understood the value of good staff, and rewarded us accordingly with generous salaries, plenty of perks and no-questions-asked expense accounts. He was a phenomenal agent. I say this not only since I am hoping he will sponsor my membership application for the Groucho club, but because I believe his management style, though harsh, worked because it was based on honesty and left no room for ambiguity. We did not have employment contracts or bi-annual job appraisals; we had pay hikes, brutal tirades and we never made the same mistake twice. Staff turnover was high; a year was considered a good innings, but some stayed and have since been rewarded with assistants of their own to train to do things the right way. The record for the shortest tenure was a day and a half. I have worked in places subsequently that are rife with resentment and petty politics, where staff feel undervalued and uninspired, and communication from the management is at best muddled and at worst non-existent. I have worked in calming, productive environments and found I longed for the glamorous urgency of my first job. I have no doubt that there are many people who would refuse to be treated like we were, but when one of your many varied responsibilities is to file and respond to the large volume of speculative applications for your own job, it is easy to feel proud of what you do. People who know me often ask if the character of Jim Taylor, showbiz terror, in my novel, How to be Famous, is based on my first boss. He is. But my first boss also inspired Max Parker, my favourite character and the only one to make a comeback in The Truth About Ruby Valentine. When you have no basis for comparison, the worst boss is also the best. \u00b7 Alison Bond's The Truth About Ruby Valentine is published this month by Penguin.
