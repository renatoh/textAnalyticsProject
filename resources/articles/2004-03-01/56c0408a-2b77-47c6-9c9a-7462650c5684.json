If ever there was a Six Nations weekend when the likely conditions cry out for a calm, experienced hand at No10 it is this one. Instead England have no choice but to bank on the largely untried 22-year-old Olly Barkley as Jonny Wilkinson's latest deputy, a selection akin to putting a fresh-faced deckhand in charge of a deep-sea trawler with a Force Nine brewing. Despite a good season for Bath, which has prompted lucrative offers from several other Premiership clubs, the Cornish-reared Barkley has never previously started a Test and, amid reports that his allocation of Ireland match tickets ended up on the black market, was not even among Sir Clive Woodward's 22-man squad last Monday. When Grayson pulled up lame and joined Wilkinson and Charlie Hodgson on the sidelines, however, the need for a specialist goalkicker enabled Barkley to leapfrog his club-mate Mike Catt and, by supreme irony, multiply his family's ticket needs. His father John is a London-based landscape gardener while his mother Jude runs a childrens' nursery in Cornwall but Woodward has already put the young man's mind at rest. \"He's got his tickets,\" sighed the coach, rather more concerned with ensuring the whole team respond positively to their Irish wake-up call a fortnight ago. Just in case there was any lingering doubt, the management even issued another eve-of-game challenge to England's forwards to rediscover the bristling qualities which saw them labelled \"white orcs on steroids\" in Wellington last summer. \"The England pack have to get back the attitude they had in New Zealand last year where we were a scary pack of forwards,\" insisted Woodward yesterday, making clear that his side's preparations have been more intense than the build-up to the Ireland game. \"The weather forecast is pretty appalling but that's fine. We're happy to play in any conditions.\" At least England, unlike France, rarely shrink in the wet. The closing games of the World Cup, last summer's win in Wellington, and the victory over the Maori in New Plymouth, demonstrated Woodward's men to be masters of such tight, close-quarter encounters. But they no longer have Martin Johnson and Neil Back's muscular expertise, nor Wilkinson to edge them home with the boot. The Welsh back three will also recall England's poor tactical kicking in the World Cup quarter-final in Brisbane, when the eventual champions conceded three tries to one and recovered to win 28-17 only after Catt came off the bench to add more midfield direction. This time, if they are to go one step further, Wales will have to display methodical as well as maverick qualities. Unless their scrum, in particular, holds firmer than it did against France it could get seriously ugly and playing for a coach whose suitcase is already half-packed may also prove a passion-killer. Nevertheless England, as they eye the barometer, know the real key to victory lies within. \"After a loss it's absolutely critical to win the next game,\" said Woodward, aware that England have not been beaten in back-to-back Tests at Twickenham since 1984. \"It doesn't matter how we win. The whole team has got to front up.\" ENGLAND 15 Jason Robinson (Sale) 14 Josh Lewsey (Wasps) 13 Will Greenwood (Harlequins) 12 Mike Tindall (Bath) 11 Ben Cohen (Northampton) 10 Olly Barkley (Bath) 9 Matt Dawson (Northampton) 1 Trevor Woodman (Gloucester) 2 Steve Thompson (Northampton) 3 Phil Vickery (Gloucester) 4 Danny Grewcock (Bath) 5 Ben Kay (Leicester) 6 Chris Jones (Sale) 7 Richard Hill (Saracens) 8 Lawrence Dallaglio (capt, Wasps) Replacements: M Regan (Leeds), J White (Leicester), S Borthwick (Bath), J Worsley (Wasps), A Gomarsall, J Simpson-Daniel (both Gloucester), M Catt (Bath) WALES 15 Gareth Thomas (Warriors) 14 Rhys Williams (Cardiff Blues) 13 Mark Taylor (Llanelli Scarlets) 12 Iestyn Harris (Cardiff Blues) 11 Shane Williams (Ospreys) 10 Stephen Jones (Scarlets) 9 Gareth Cooper (Warriors) 1 Duncan Jones (Ospreys) 2 Robin McBryde (Scarlets) 3 Gethin Jenkins (Warriors) 4 Brent Cockbain (Warriors) 5 Michael Owen (Gwent Dragons) 6 Jonathan Thomas (Ospreys) 7 Colin Charvis (capt, Tarbes) 8 Dafydd Jones (Scarlets) Replacements: M Davies (Warriors), B Evans (Blues), G Llewellyn (Ospreys), M Williams (Blues), D Peel (Scarlets), C Sweeney (Warriors), T Shanklin (Blues)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
