The PSP was sleek with a gorgeous widescreen display. The Nintendo DS looked like a toy. Even the inclusion of two screens wasn't enough to get anyone excited. But while the PSP has done well enough \u2013 it has sold more than 50m units \u2013 Nintendo's ugly duckling has grown into a phenomenon. The console has now shifted more than 100m units. The trend was recently confirmed when the DS overtook the PlayStation 2 to become the biggest selling games console in UK history. But why has the DS done so well? You can credit three main factors: the welcoming interface, which has been crucial in opening up the appeal to non-gamers; with the DS you didn't need any of the traditional gaming dexterity to succeed \u2013 the ability to jab at a screen with a stylus was usually enough; the sleek, minimal styling of later models helped but most important of all has been the variety of content. The DS's catalogue is far more varied than the sports 'n' shooting console norm. Combine these and you have a console that has shattered long-standing gamer/non-gamer barriers. The big kickstart was the initial redesign. The DS Lite was launched in 2006 and started attracting an audience that had ignored the chunky original. Continuing redesigns and improvements have helped, but this is only part of the story. Around the time the DS Lite arrived, Nintendo launched Brain Training: the self-improvement software had been a huge success in Japan and was quickly adopted in other markets. Brain Training and its sequels alone are probably accountable for half of those 10m UK sales. The huge success caused an avalanche of similar titles and soon the DS was swamped with fitness, puzzle and general self-improvement titles. The quality was variable but accessibility was near universal. There was the occasional Mario and Zelda to keep the gamers happy too, but the success of the DS has been driven by the sheer variety of software available for it. Titles such as Brain Training and Nintendogs offered rewarding entertainment to people who wouldn't consider themselves gamers. The stylus interface, and celeb-friendly marketing have been integral to the DS's success. Children's software has been hugely popular too. Less happily for Nintendo piracy has also contributed to those hefty sales figures. Along with Sudoku, crosswords and puzzle titles, \u2013 Professor Layton in particular \u2013 the DS has become the handheld games console for everyone. Well, nearly everyone. Hardcore gamers have often been turned off by the barrage of puzzle-party minigame releases, and there is no doubt Sony's PSP is the better bet for this audience. However, titles such as the latest Zelda game will definitely appeal to veteran gamers while the marvellous Korg DS-10 music software proves the DS is far from a toy. Whatever the future holds for the DS, \u2013 and it will certainly involve numerous new iterations of both hardware and Brain Training \u2013 it is unlikely to see its UK sales record beaten by a competitor any time soon. No one, even those employed by Nintendo at the time, would have predicted that in 2005."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
