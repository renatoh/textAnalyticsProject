The daughter, who was born at the time of economic liberalisation, has badgered him to partake in India's consumer boom and buy her a mobile phone. The father needed to be accompanied on a train journey back to his impoverished home state to collect his pension. In the process, Nagendra fought two battles familiar to middle-class Indian families. One was against an uncaring, sclerotic bureaucracy, which he ultimately won. The second was about a teenager's pursuit of a phone, which Nagendra lost. Shristi's quest for a mobile began a year ago with a low-key campaign that she rolled out at the time of her exam results. With each good score , she popped the phone question, telling Nagendra it had become embarrassing to tell her friends she hadn't got a \"cell\". But in recent weeks, in response to Nagendra's stalling, she upped the pressure. Victory was achieved only after a \"food strike\". Shristi refused to leave her room and come to the family table to eat breakfast and lunch, but sustained herself on a secret stash of groundnuts hidden under her bed. Sarvocch, her 14-year-old brother, caught her and blew the whistle. By evening, Nagendra was ready to make up. \"I saw those tears falling and my heart just breaks,\" he says. He promised he would take her to choose a phone from one of the shiny shopping malls in Gurgaon, a satellite city on the outskirts of Delhi selling global brands. The details of who is to pay for the calls are still being thrashed out. \"I'll not give you money for the phone,\" Nagendra says as they sit together on the small balcony of their flat. \"Let's see,\" says Shristi, archly. Just one week earlier, Nagendra fought another battle in considerably more hostile terrain when he travelled by train with his disabled father, Vishwanath, to Bihar, India's poorest and least developed state in the north-east of the country. Once a year, his father, a retired police officer, has to go to the State Bank of India branch nearest to his home village to prove to officials issuing his annual pension that he is still alive. This was simple until he moved to Delhi, following a stroke, three years ago. But he has yet to transfer his pension to a Delhi branch and so, despite being unable to walk, he has to make the train trip - 16 hours each way - to the town of Ara. The journey tested Nagendra's physical strength as well as his patience. Nagendra and an elderly uncle lifted Vishwanath, who weighs more than 100kg, from an auto rickshaw on to a station wheelchair and then on to his berth. When they arrived in Ara, the two men struggled to cram Vishwanath into a rickshaw to reach the bank. There, Nagendra faced obstructive and officious staff who questioned the elderly man's now frail and shaky signature. Eventually, Nagendra cajoled them into giving Vishwanath his 40,000 rupees (\u00a3465). Nagendra decided to visit his ancestral village, which he has not seen for 12 years. He found his childhood home deserted and dilapidated. His generation have all moved to the city. \"It was a very sad feeling,\" he says. \"I wanted to see it beautiful; surrounded by cows and a garden, but for the ordinary man, life is very miserable in Bihar. I was very happy to come back home.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
