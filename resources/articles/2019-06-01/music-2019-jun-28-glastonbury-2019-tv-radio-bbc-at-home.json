But even if you are a bit jealous of everyone down at Worthy Farm, there\u2019s still a huge amount of coverage to enjoy at home via the Guardian and the BBC. We\u2019ll be on site, liveblogging from 11am until midnight each day with reviews of all the key acts, plus features on Glastonbury\u2019s food, fashion, politics, raves, sex, hippies and weird secret corners. The BBC meanwhile is hosting a typically comprehensive range of coverage on radio and TV \u2013 in fact, you can listen 24 hours a day via the BBC Radio Glastonbury station on the Sounds app, which features music from artists playing the festival alongside live shows, classic performances and occasional takeovers from the likes of Sigrid. Here are the highlights from their regular programming. Friday \u2022 Zo\u00eb Ball\u2019s breakfast show on Radio 2 will be live from Glastonbury, featuring music from Sheryl Crow and chat with Kylie Minogue as she prepares for her legends slot on Sunday afternoon. Later on, Steve Lamacq\u2019s 6 Music show will have appearances from two of the best bands currently out there, the bracingly snotty Idles and Fontaines DC. \u2022 BBC Two has a half-hour evening show from 7.30pm, with performances from Jorja Smith, Rosal\u00eda and Sam Fender. Time-lapse fans will be enthralled by a piece on how the Glastonbury festival site is brought together. \u2022 Lauren Laverne will host coverage of Tame Impala\u2019s headlining set on the Other stage from 10pm, as they play their dreamy, funky, Instagram-filtered psychpop. \u2022 Stormzy\u2019s headline set will presumably require a two second blackout to silence 100,000 people shouting \u201cFuck Boris\u201d during Vossi Bop \u2013 it begins at 10.15pm and will air on BBC Two, whose coverage begins at 9.50pm; on 1Xtra, DJ Target warms up for Stormzy\u2019s performance with special guest appearances. Afterwards on BBC Two, there will be coverage of Interpol, Jon Hopkins and Cat Power. Saturday \u2022 Not to be missed in BBC Two\u2019s afternoon coverage (from 3.30pm) is the Love Unlimited Synth Orchestra, featuring members of the British Paraorchestra alongside a wall of synth players playing Barry White classics, sung by the likes of Gruff Rhys. There\u2019ll also be performances from Anne-Marie, Hozier and Lewis Capaldi; BBC Four has Johnny Marr and country-pop star Carrie Underwood. \u2022 From 7.30pm, the focus will be on female pop: Janet Jackson\u2019s Pyramid stage performance, plus Sigrid and Lizzo lower down the bill, and Florence-alike Freya Ridings popping in for an acoustic performance. Neneh Cherry\u2019s set will be shown on BBC Four from 8pm, along with the Park stage\u2019s secret set which is \u201ca much loved British band\u201d. \u2022 Then it\u2019s blokey indie rock: the Courteeners tee up Liam Gallagher on BBC Four from 9pm, with BBC Two ceding to the Killers\u2019 headlining the Pyramid stage at 9.45pm, also aired on Radio 2. Afterwards there\u2019ll be party fare from Mark Ronson, Hot Chip and a report from the reliably debauched Block9 area. Sunday \u2022 On 5 Live from 11am, Laura Whitmore has the potentially brilliant job of talking to people around the festival site, as the edibles wear off and time dissolves. \u2022 The Beeb allows its coverage to make a rare foray on to BBC One from 6pm, thanks to Kylie \u2013 see her hits-packed set from earlier in the afternoon, along with highlights from Miley Cyrus. The awesome Jamaican reggae star Koffee will do an acoustic number on this show too \u2013 a possibly star-making turn. \u2022 There\u2019s two chances to see the startlingly talented teen gothpop star Billie Eilish, on BBC Four and BBC Two from 9pm. The latter show will feature the Cure\u2019s headline set \u2013 also aired on 6 Music \u2013 and highlights from Rex Orange County and the Streets, but be sure to catch a short film about Langa Methodist Church Choir, a stirring 40-strong Cape Town ensemble personally invited by the Eavises after they met during a charity project. \u2022 BBC Four\u2019s coverage ends the weekend on a real high. It wisely kicks off at 7pm with everyone\u2019s favourite debonair dilf, Jeff Goldblum, as he appears with his swing band the Mildred Snitzer Orchestra. Mavis Staples is still breathing righteous social fury at the age of 79; Kamasi Washington\u2019s cosmic jazz might have got a bit stately of late, but is still a big sumptuous experience; Janelle Mon\u00e1e matches the stage charisma of her hero Prince; Vampire Weekend hit the Pyramid with their best album to date; and Christine and the Queens\u2019 live show is an incredible blend of contemporary dance, pop and self-help seminar \u2013 all of it worth dipping out of the Cure for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
