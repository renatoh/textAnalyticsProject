Grillo, who has been instrumental in turning the movement into Italy\u2019s most popular party, roared on to the political scene in 2009 after joining forces with the late web strategist Gianroberto Casaleggio to launch a blog that railed against political corruption. The blog struck a chord among an electorate weighed down by the economic crisis and fed up with the traditional political class, and became the driving force behind the movement\u2019s phenomenal success in the 2013 elections, when it snatched the second-largest share of the votes. But the blog has now removed most references to the party. The 69-year-old has started a new blog, which he said will focus on technology and visions for the future as part of an \u201cextraordinary liberating adventure\u201d. He added that while he \u201clikes to have points of view\u201d he is \u201cfed up with opinions\u201d. Quite what that means has left commentators guessing, but Grillo has been distancing himself from the party for some time. In 2015, just a year after the party made gains in the European elections, he announced that he was leaving politics and returning to comedy. As he toured comedy clubs, the gaffe-prone Grillo was thrust back into the spotlight a year later after taking a swipe at Sadiq Khan, saying the Muslim mayor of London would \u201cblow himself up in front of Westminster\u201d. After that Grillo took more of a back seat, gradually grooming 31-year-old Luigi di Maio for the party\u2019s leadership. Di Maio, who was elected leader in September and is the party\u2019s candidate for prime minister, said on Tuesday night that the split did not mean \u201cpatricide\u201d or \u201creneging on the past\u201d. \u201cThe party is now moving forward on its own legs and getting stronger,\u201d he said. The Five Star Movement is leading in opinion polls, ahead of the centre-left Democratic party, Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia and the far-right Northern League. Roberto d\u2019Alimonte, a political science professor at Rome\u2019s Luiss University, said: \u201cMaybe [Grillo] wants to guarantee its survival and see how it will fly in his absence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
