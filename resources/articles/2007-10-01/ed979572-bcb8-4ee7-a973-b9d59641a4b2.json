Behind the fresh face lurks a hard-nosed racer for whom second stopped being good enough even before he had tasted victory. One corner into his Formula One career he had lived up to the hype. He followed a botched start in Melbourne with a brilliant move around the outside of two cars - one of them driven by his world champion team-mate - that raised both eyebrows and the profile of F1 worldwide. Since the Australian Grand Prix back in March the 22-year-old has just got better and better... and more and more popular. Despite McLaren doing their utmost to shield their wunderkind from the press, he quickly became Britain's favourite sporting hero. On the track he was making a fool of Ferrari's Felipe Massa, pushing Fernando Alonso to the limit and building up a healthy lead in the championship. Out of his racing overalls he was charming, attentive and good-looking, while staying as grounded as any ordinary kid from Stevenage, albeit one that gets to hang out with P Diddy - 'I call him Sean,' boasted Lewis. But as the world warmed to Hamilton, he revealed a colder, more ruthless side. At Monaco he came home second to Alonso but immediately announced that his team had prevented him challenging for the win. In Indianapolis he would not give way to his team-mate, getting the better of a 200mph duel along the main straight. By the Hungarian Grand Prix things had got ugly and it was Hamilton's refusal to keep his word and let Alonso by in qualifying that led to the infamous block by the Spaniard in the Budapest pit lane. Win or lose this afternoon, Hamilton is the big winner of 2007, and his earning potential can simply be described as limitless. He is the face of F1. He is the boy next door who had a dream, and then lived it flat-out, in seventh gear. He might have the face of an angel, but once the visor comes down on that distinctive yellow helmet, there's plenty of devil in Lewis Hamilton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
