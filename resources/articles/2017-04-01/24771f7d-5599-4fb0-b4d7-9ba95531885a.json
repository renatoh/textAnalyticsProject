The Swede injured his right knee and as he has yet to agree a new one-year deal at United there are fears the 35-year-old might never play for the club again should it prove a long-term problem. Of Ibrahimovic and Rojo, who also hurt a knee and was seen limping heavily afterwards, Mourinho said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they are easy injuries but I prefer to wait until all the tests are done and then speak. I can\u2019t do that because I am a manager not a doctor. But the news is fairly negative, I think.\u201d United defeated Anderlecht 2-1 in extra time to knock the Belgian club out 3-2 on aggregate, the goals coming from Henrikh Mkhitaryan after 10 minutes and Marcus Rashford in the 107th. Sofiane Hanni equalised for Anderlecht just after the half-hour mark as United faltered following Rojo\u2019s injury. The Argentinian was taken off after 23 minutes, thus becoming the third of United\u2019s four recognised central defenders to suffer a serious problem. Smalling has a knee problem and Jones a toe injury which had appeared to rule them out until mid-May. Yet Mourinho said: \u201cWe have Daley Blind, and it is time for Jones and Smalling to be brave, to risk, because for the team you have the do everything.\u201d Asked how soon the pair might come back, the manager joked: \u201cIf it was me, tomorrow. But no, they cannot do miracles. But rather than mid-May make it early May.\u201d Mourinho praised Luke Shaw after the left-back refused to come off with cramp at the end of 90 minutes. \u201cLuke did something different. He told me: \u2018I\u2019m going to play 30 minutes with cramps, no problem \u2013 I\u2019m ready for it,\u2019\u201d said the manager. \u201cThese [things] are what make me trust the players. I am tired but I imagine the players are tired more than me. But we still have the dream of winning the Europa League.\u201d Of Rashford, who created Mkhitaryan\u2019s opener and went on to score the winner, Mourinho said: \u201cYou speak about his qualities and they are fantastic. But mentally he is excellent. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t scored since September [until he scored at Sunderland on 9 April]. Some players don\u2019t understand what I want but Marcus I trust. It doesn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t score \u2013 he is fantastic in his effort and attitude.\u201d Rashford said: \u201cAll you can do is keep trying to create chances, that\u2019s what we kept doing and we pinned them back. We had a lot of chances and could have scored but sometimes games go like that. We got one in the end. You just have to keep going and hope you get another chance. We\u2019ve done it the hard way but none of that matters now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
