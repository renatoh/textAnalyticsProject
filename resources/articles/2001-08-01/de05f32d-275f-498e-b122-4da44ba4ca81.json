Two years ago Rotherham languished in the basement but after spending only \u00a3200,000 on players, they return to the First Division this afternoon for the first time since 1983. The success has propelled their manager Ronnie Moore into the consciousness of rival chairmen, though he signed a new four-year deal in the summer. \"Ronnie is up there with the top managers I've played for, and that includes Sir Alex Ferguson,\" said Rotherham's Mark Robins, the man whose goals in the 1990 FA Cup run helped save Ferguson's job. \"We know it's going to be hard,\" Moore said. \"Our squad still isn't big enough for the First Division, but if we're still in it next year it will be like another promotion for us.\" His achievements will not be lost on this afternoon's visitors Crystal Palace, who spent more money than Fulham and Blackburn last term, only to avoid relegation with three minutes of the season remaining. Coventry travel to Stockport for their first game outside the top flight for 34 years and include Keith O'Neill and Lee Hughes, signed for almost \u00a36m last week. Bradford return with a derby against Barnsley. The Bantams' players will not receive win bonuses if they finish out of the top 10. \"Anything other than a top-six place would be a major disappointment,\" said the City chairman Geoffrey Richmond. \"This is a hugely significant indication of the way they view their own prospects.\" In the Second Division, Cardiff City face Wycombe and remain hopeful of recruiting Andy Booth and Chris Lucketti from Huddersfield in a \u00a32m deal. Lucketti will open talks next week, though Town's manager Lou Macari has threatened to report the Welsh club for an illegal approach for Booth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
