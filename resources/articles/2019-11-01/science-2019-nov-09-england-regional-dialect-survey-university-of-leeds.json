Survey of England's regional dialects to be revived", "bodyText": "Are you terrified by \u201charvest men\u201d or \u201clong-legged tailors\u201d? Do you have \u201cferntickles\u201d or \u201cbrunny-spots\u201d on your face? If someone called you \u201cgibble-fisted\u201d would you be affronted or amused? The words for daddy long-legs, freckles and left-handed are all examples of English regional dialect discovered in the 1950s by a team of fieldworkers in what was the most comprehensive survey of its kind ever undertaken. On Saturday, the University of Leeds announced plans to update the survey by recruiting volunteers to be modern-day dialect researchers, thanks to more than \u00a3500,000 of national lottery funding. The original surveyors set out from Leeds 70 years ago, targeting \u201cold men with good teeth\u201d for two reasons: they were a more likely to be a bridge to the past, and they could be understood. Fiona Douglas from Leeds School of English, who is leading the project, said the net would be cast wider this time round. \u201cI\u2019m not just going out looking for old men with good teeth who haven\u2019t moved anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will speak to people whose families haven\u2019t stayed in one area for generations, as well as those who can trace their roots back to the same place over hundreds of years. We want to include everyone\u2019s language.\u201d The lottery money will also allow the digitisation of notebooks, photographs, word maps and audio recordings from the original fieldwork. The extensive Leeds Archive of Vernacular Culture (LAVC) will be opened to the public. Researchers are keen also to speak to descendants of people who took part in the original surveys. Douglas said she had already tracked down three of the fieldworkers who travelled the country, first with notebooks and later with cumbersome reel-to-reel audio recorders that were sometimes hooked up to car batteries because of a lack of mains electricity. Others to come forward include the children and grandchildren of original respondents. Some remember Werner Kissling, an ethnographic photographer who worked for the project in the 1960s and captured Wensleydale kids playing \u201cwallops\u201d \u2013 a variant of skittles \u2013 in the road. \u201cI\u2019ve heard tell of fieldwork done in fishing boats in the middle of the night and dialect caravans touring the country,\u201d Douglas said. The original surveyors picked up a wealth of data. As well as \u201cgibble-fisted\u201d for left-handed, they discovered cack-handed, cat-handed, coochy-pawed, left-kaggy and squippy. Freckles were called ferntickles, murfles, brannyspreckles, brunny-spots, vrackles and frantittles. A packed lunch might have been bait, jock or snap. Douglas said dialect was a way of looking in at a window to the past. \u201cSometimes people feel embarrassed saying \u2018oh it\u2019s slang\u2019. When you say to somebody, it\u2019s not, and it\u2019s got a really long, distinguished and historical pedigree, suddenly you get people with this sense of empowerment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
