I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories at home and abroad today. A fierce backlash has forced Donald Trump to row back on comments that he wanted the NHS included in UK/US trade talks as his state visit continued to fuel controversy. After interfering with the Tory leadership race by backing Boris Johnson, the US president caused a furore by suggesting that Washington would try to win access to NHS contracts for US companies in post-Brexit trade talks. All sides of politics reacted angrily to the idea with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he would fight it with his \u201clast breath\u201d. As senior Tories such as Jeremy Hunt also condemned the remarks, Trump later said that the NHS \u201cwould not be on the table\u201d because the health service was \u201cnot trade\u201d. The backflip capped a lively day for Trump in which he met Theresa May but refused an audience with Corbyn because he is \u201csomewhat of a negative force\u201d. The president did however have time for two of May\u2019s would-be successors, Hunt and Michael Gove, as well as hardline Brexit supporters Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, and Nigel Farage. Johnson turned down the president in order to speak at a One Nation Tory MPs hustings event on Tuesday night. He told them the party faced \u201cextinction\u201d if it didn\u2019t deliver Brexit. Polly Toynbee agrees with Johnson that the Tories face extinction, but she predicts he will be the last ever Conservative PM because of a no-deal, not because of averting it. * * * Pell appeals \u2013 George Pell, the most senior Catholic convicted of child sexual abuse, has been taken from prison to hear the beginning of his appeal in a Melbourne court. The disgraced cardinal was dressed in black and wearing his clerical collar as he listened to his lawyer argue that the prosecution\u2019s case about when the historic offences took place were flawed and that his client should be acquitted on grounds that his conviction was unreasonable. * * * Plastic toll \u2013 Plastics waste makes up nearly 60% of the litter found in canals in England and Wales and more than half a million plastic items reach the sea every year from the waterway network. A study by the Canal &amp; River Trust used data from 25 urban and rural spots on the 2,000-mile network and has urged local communities to help clean up the mess. It says that if every visitor to the network picked up one piece of plastic per visit, the problem would be cleared up in a year. * * * \u2018Humiliating for us\u2019 \u2013 Supporters of India\u2019s first openly gay athlete, Dutee Chand, fear for her safety after her decision to come out prompted a backlash in her home village. Reaction in Chaka Gopalpur in the eastern state of Odisha was hostile after she said she was in a gay relationship with her partner. Chand\u2019s mother, Akhuji, told the Indian Express she had always supported her daughter in sport but this was \u201cnot permitted\u201d in the village. One local said the athlete\u2019s sexuality was \u201chumiliating\u201d. * * * Lakes land \u2013 The National Trust has spent \u00a3202,000 acquiring a hill in the Lake District, the view from which inspired JMW Turner to paint his watercolour Crummock Water, Looking Towards Buttermere in 1797. The vista from Brackenthwaite Hows was spotted by the artist on his first visit to the area and it was popular with Georgian and Victorian visitors. But despite offering splendid views of the north-west Lakes, it fell out of fashion as visitors flocked to high peaks such as nearby Scafell Pike. A couple who helped the deal by giving their share of the land back to the charity said they hoped \u201cthe natural beauty can be preserved\u201d for the nation. * * * Back with a bang \u2013 Work on the new James Bond film has been hit after a \u201ccontrolled explosion\u201d on the set at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. No one inside the studio was hurt, but one crew member outside suffered a minor injury, the filmmakers said. The exterior of the stage was damaged. The Sun reported that the blast occurred when a stunt went wrong. Filming of the yet unnamed film was delayed earlier this year when 007 star Daniel Craig hurt his ankle on set. Today in Focus podcast: Decline and fall of a retail empire As Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire faces the prospect of entering administration, putting 18,000 jobs at risk, the Guardian business reporter Sarah Butler discusses how we got here.

Lunchtime read: Why McDonald\u2019s is the centre of life for America\u2019s outsiders Chris Arnade has been chronicling the struggles of America\u2019s poorest communities for some time and he has now written a book about the people left behind in the world\u2019s richest country. In an extract from Dignity, Arnade visits the post-industrial rustbelt towns of Portsmouth, Ohio and Gary, Indiana where he talks to people in the place that usually doubles as a restaurant and community centre in such towns: McDonald\u2019s. It\u2019s a place to clean up (and sometimes shoot up), meet friends and charge your phone, with regulars preferring it to non-profit drop-in centres because McDonald\u2019s staff \u201cdon\u2019t tell us what to do\u201d. In devastated, drugs-ridden Gary, the big golden arches aren\u2019t just the town\u2019s community centre, they are the town square. Sport Chris Woakes insisted England did not suffer a car crash against Pakistan after the 14-run defeat that proved an early setback at the World Cup, a tournament which, writes Andy Bull, has brought diverse parts of Britain\u2019s cricket community together and made the sport feel bright and vital. Johanna Konta will draw on her experience of defeats in two previous grand slam semi-finals as she chases the French Open title after blitzing Sloane Stephens. Juventus have made contact with Manchester United to see whether they would consider selling Paul Pogba this summer. Anthony Joshua will get the chance to win back his IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles in a rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr later this year.

Business Neil Woodford, one of the biggest names in the City, faces more turbulence today after shares in his listed investment firm fell sharply along with other companies\u2019 stock prices after he blocked withdrawal from one of his funds. The stock picker enjoys a stellar reputation in the Square Mile but saw shares in his his Patient Capital Trust Fund plunge 20% on Tuesday amid concerns about some of his post-Brexit investments. In Asia Pacific, stock markets followed Wall Street\u2019s lead higher although the Australian economy has recorded its weakest growth for 10 years. The FTSE100 is due to open up slightly while sterling is at $1.27 and \u20ac1.128.
