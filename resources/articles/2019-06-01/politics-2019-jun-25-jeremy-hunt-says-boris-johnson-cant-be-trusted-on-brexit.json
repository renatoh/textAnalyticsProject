Speaking after a war of words with his Conservative leadership rival, whom Hunt branded a coward for turning down a debate with him on Sky News on Tuesday night, Hunt said 31 October was a \u201cfake deadline\u201d and could lead to a snap general election. He made the comments after Johnson wrote to him asking him to commit to taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October come what may. Hunt said he believed that would be \u201cmore likely to trip us into a general election before we\u2019ve delivered Brexit, and that would hand the keys to Jeremy Corbyn and then we\u2019d have no Brexit at all\u201d. Hunt said he believed a new prime minister would know soon whether a new deal was possible. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t and if no deal is still on the table I\u2019ve been very clear. I will leave the European Union without a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to do that if there\u2019s a prospect of a better deal and if I did it, it would be with a heavy heart, because businesses up and down the country would face a lot of destruction.\u201d He said he would aim to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop, which he said was an approach \u201cnot too different to what Boris wants\u201d. However, he said he believed he had a far greater chance of succeeding in Brussels than Johnson. \u201cWho is the person that we trust to send to Brussels on behalf of the British people and come back with a deal, and that has to be someone that they trust, that they\u2019re prepared to talk to, because in the end you don\u2019t do a deal with someone you don\u2019t trust,\u201d he said. Hunt said he was not trying to paint his rival as untrustworthy. \u201cI would serve Boris Johnson to the very best of my ability and make his prime ministership a success and I hope he\u2019d do the same for me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut obviously members of the Conservative party need to make their choice about who will come back with that deal.\u201d Hunt said he had been \u201cwaiting for this moment for 30 years of my life \u2026 I have been sitting around that table thinking about how I want to transform our country. \u201cI think this is a moment when I look at Brexit and this incredible moment in our history and we could really unleash our potential, and that\u2019s what really gets me up in the morning.\u201d The foreign secretary was questioned about his view that the legal time limit for an abortion should be reduced from 24 weeks to 12, reiterating he would not seek to change the law. He said if parliament voted on legal time limits in a private members\u2019 bill, his vote would be \u201ca matter of conscience\u201d but declined to say which way he would vote. Pressed on whether he would personally vote for it, he said: \u201cWell, I\u2019d have to look at what that bill was but I think for people watching this programme, what they want to know is as prime minister I recognise this is a free vote matter and I wouldn\u2019t seek to change the law.\u201d On Tuesday night, Hunt took questions on Twitter under the hashtag #BoJoNoShow, a reference to his rival\u2019s refusal to participate in a head-to-head debate that Sky News had been hoping to host that evening. Hunt\u2019s Twitter responses included an admission that \u201cpolice cuts went too far\u201d and an expression of regret over the NHS junior doctor strikes that took place in January 2016 while he was health secretary. He ended the session by posting:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
