Though City insist Anelka is not for sale, the Frenchman is understood to have broached the subject of a possible move in a meeting with his manager Kevin Keegan last week. He was told City would only sanction a transfer if they could recoup the \u00a313m paid to Paris St-Germain for the forward two years ago. Given that they still owe around \u00a36m in instalments to PSG from that original move, City would not be willing to loan out a player who has scored 39 goals in 84 games and costs them \u00a335,000 a week. That could yet scupper Monaco's interest - they remain in talks with Barcelona over the possible loan signing of the Argentinian striker Javier Saviola as an alternative - though City will still be disturbed that Deschamps has sounded Anelka out. \"Nicolas is a great player so of course I am interested in him, and on top of that he is French,\" said the Monaco manager. \"I spoke to him on the phone. I know him very well and I know how he works. He and Saviola have different styles but they are excellent strikers. The Monaco board know what my preference is but the financial side is important and we are also looking at other players.\" Wolves have completed the signing of the former Sweden international Joachim Bjorklund. The central defender has signed a one-year contract with the club and could make his debut in their Championship opener at Stoke on Sunday. The 33-year-old Bjorklund, formerly of Sunderland, Valencia and Rangers, was a free agent and no fee was involved. \"I first heard of Wolves' interest about a week ago,\" he said, \"and I didn't really need to think twice about wanting to come here.\" Bjorklund's arrival is a boost for the manager Dave Jones, who has missed out on a series of defensive replacements for Paul Butler and Isaac Okoronkwo. Joleon Lescott is still recovering from a year-long knee injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
