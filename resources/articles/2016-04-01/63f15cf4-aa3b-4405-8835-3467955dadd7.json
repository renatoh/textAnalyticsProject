Frontex\u2019s annual risk analysis, released on Tuesday, said: \u201cThe Paris attacks in November 2015 clearly demonstrated that irregular migratory flows could be used by terrorists to enter the EU.\u201d Echoing observations made five months ago, the report added: \u201cTwo of the terrorists involved in the attacks had previously irregularly entered through Leros and had been registered by the Greek authorities. They presented fraudulent Syrian documents to speed up their registration process. \u201cAs the vast majority of migrants arrive undocumented, screening activities are essential to properly verify their declaration of nationality.\u201d Frontex\u2019s suggestions come weeks after European politicians introduced a stringent new border policy that will see almost all asylum seekers landing on islands such as Leros returned to Turkey. Frontex claimed that it had documented an estimated 1.8m illegal border crossings in 2015 \u2013 a six-fold increase on the previous record. In response, migration experts warned that the number of irregular migrants arriving in Europe was likely to be far lower as one individual migrant may have been counted as they crossed several borders. \u201cThey are not talking about 1.8 million people \u2013 they are talking about 1.8 million border detections,\u201d said Nando Sigona, a migration-focussed academic at the University of Birmingham, who has previously written about Frontex\u2019s use of statistics. \u201cPeople may have crossed more than one border.\u201d Frontex has previously been forced to admit that it double-counts migrants in its statistics. \u201cPeople arriving in Greece would again be counted entering Hungary,\u201d the organisation said in a tweet last year. Sigona added that it was not necessarily useful to compare Frontex\u2019s 2015 figures with numbers from previous years, since European countries did not allocate so many resources to detecting migrants in the past. \u201cYou can\u2019t really use numbers from previous years because we\u2019re putting more resources into intercepting people than we used to,\u201d Sigona said. \u201cNowadays every boat is counted, whereas in the past that was not the case.\u201d Brexit campaigners said the report was evidence that the UK was at risk from terrorists able to slip through European borders. A Leave.EU spokesman said: \u201cPrevented by free movement rules from carrying out extensive background checks on EU nationals, we are now in clear danger from European Islamists, who can seek to establish UK terror cells after slipping through the Schengen Area\u2019s porous external border.\u201d A spokesman for Britain Stronger in Europe said Britain had control of its borders: \u201cBritain\u2019s deal with the EU gives us the best of both worlds \u2013 opting into things that help keep us safe, like co-operation on security issues, but opting out of things that do not work for us, like the borderless Schengen area.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
