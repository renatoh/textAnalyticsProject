The unduly lenient scheme (ULS) gives anyone the power to ask the attorney general to consider referring a sentence to the court of appeal for reconsideration \u2013 where it could then be increased if deemed unduly lenient. Under plans confirmed on Tuesday, the scheme will be extended to 14 new offences \u2013 including a range of child sexual abuse crimes, stalking and the domestic abuse charge of controlling or coercive behaviour. Murder, robbery and a range of terror offences are already covered by the scheme, which saw a dip in use last year. In 2018, of the 140 offenders referred to the courts by the scheme, 99 offenders had their sentences increased. This compared to 173 referrals in 2017, which led to an increase in the sentences of 137 offenders. Robert Buckland QC, the justice secretary, said: \u201cSentences are decided by our independent judiciary based on the facts before them, but it is absolutely right that victims have a voice in the system when punishments don\u2019t appear to fit the crime.\u201d The move to expand the scheme comes at a time of debate over the pressures of overcrowding on the prison estate, with Boris Johnson pledging to create an extra 10,000 prison places. Since becoming prime minister, Johnson and his government have attempted to make a hardline approach to criminal justice a central plank of their domestic agenda \u2013 a move denounced as populist by critics. Johnson and his cabinet have made a wave of a justice-focused announcements, including on new prison places, tougher sentencing, increased use of stop and search and more police officers on the streets. The following offences have been added to the ULS: Abuse of position of trust: sexual activity with a child (section 16 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003). Abuse of position of trust: causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity (section 17, Sexual Offences Act 2003). Abuse of position of trust: sexual activity in the presence of a child (section 18, Sexual Offences Act 2003).
