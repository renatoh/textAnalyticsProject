The subsequent denial that his Old Trafford howler had been playing on his mind was rendered somewhat suspicious by the relish with which he celebrated thrashing the chance created by Steve Morison's back\u2011post header past the Swansea goalkeeper Michel Vorm after just 48 seconds. \"I wasn't going to miss that one,\" said Pilkington, and nor did he miss shortly after the hour, sealing Norwich's third win in four games by swivelling on to Bradley Johnson's slightly fortuitous pass to shoot past Vorm. In between, Russell Martin had risen unopposed to head in David Fox's free-kick, but Danny Graham's immediate reply for the visitors, created by Scott Sinclair, had made for a richly entertaining first half in which these two newly promoted sides went at each other with style as well as determination. Only after Pilkington's second did the intensity level finally drop off and Swansea begin to look weary. Afterwards the Norwich manager, Paul Lambert, highlighted the efforts of Pilkington and Morison. \"Everybody spoke about the chance Anthony had at Manchester United and he's showed a lot of character, both in coming back from that and from the very serious injury he had,\" said Lambert. In March Pilkington suffered a broken left fibula and dislocated ankle while playing for his former club Huddersfield Town. Not for the first time this season, however, it was the contribution of Morison, playing as a solitary target man, which made Norwich's system work. The 28-year-old, who spent most of his career before joining Millwall in 2009 in non\u2011league football, retained possession superbly as well as winning any number of headers before limping off in the second half with what his manager hoped was no more than cramp. \"I thought Morison gave as good a No9 performance as I've seen for a long time, and I've seen some good strikers,\" said Lambert. Swansea's defeat was their fourth in four games away from the Liberty Stadium, and while the first three came against Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal, defeat at the ground of another newly promoted side will no doubt have people talking about a pattern. That would be unfair, according to the manager, Brendan Rodgers, though he acknowledged his side had been far from their best defensively. \"I felt there were many positives \u2013 we were very good going forward and we took our goal very well \u2013 but defensively we weren't as organised as we usually are,\" said Rodgers. \"We understand it's difficult to get a win away from home in the Premier League, but we'll regroup, reflect on the game and learn from it. We've obviously had a tough start away from home, but the first season in the Premier League is very much about home form, and picking up what you can away. And one thing these players have always done is learn.\" For all Norwich's excellent start, Pilkington did not need reminding that Blackpool stood eighth in the Premier League in February before being relegated in May. Although someone did, naturally. \"Look, no one's going to get carried away,\" he said. \"Everybody's enjoying it \u2013 how could you not? \u2013 but there will be a lot more ups and downs and we know we're going to have to work really hard to stay here.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
