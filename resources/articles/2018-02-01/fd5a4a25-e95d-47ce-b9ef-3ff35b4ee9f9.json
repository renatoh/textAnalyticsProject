The MP, who recently topped a ConservativeHome poll of who should be the next party leader when Theresa May departs, said the Tories should learn from the way the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, set out a vision for what he believed in. Meanwhile, Anna Soubry, a leading pro-Europe Tory MP has threatened to quit the party if it is taken over by the likes of Rees-Mogg and fellow Brexiter Boris Johnson. She told BBC2\u2019s Newsnight that they \u201care not proper Conservatives\u201d, and warned May that she is in danger of losing \u201chuge swathes\u201d of the party if she doesn\u2019t stand up to the pair. Hinting that she might even form some kind of new alliance, Soubry continued: \u201cSomething is going to have to give because if it doesn\u2019t, not only will we get Jacob Rees-Mogg as our prime minister, we will get a devastating hard Brexit which will cause huge damage to our economy for generations to come. And I am not prepared to sit by any longer and put up with this nonsense.\u201d Rees-Mogg made his comments to postgraduate journalism diploma students at the Press Association who asked him if he wanted to be prime minister. \u201cI think \u2018want\u2019 is very much the wrong word. If you look at Mrs May, it seems to be quite clear she does it because it\u2019s her duty to do it. I don\u2019t get the impression that it\u2019s a lot of fun for her \u2013 it\u2019s hard work.\u201d The North East Somerset MP said his large family would make the task difficult, although he is not seen as the most hands-on father, having never changed a nappy. \u201cI\u2019ve got six children; it would be very, very difficult as a family man, so \u2018want\u2019 is not the right word. I\u2019m very happy as a backbencher and what I do want is Mrs May to stay prime minister,\u201d he said. Focusing on last year\u2019s general election campaign, which resulted in the Tories being stripped of their parliamentary majority, Rees-Mogg said: \u201cWe should have a more optimistic vision; what we had to say at the last election was so gloomy. It was that we will manage things better than the other side will, but it is going to be really nasty. We\u2019re going to make you sell your house if you\u2019re elderly and, if you\u2019re young, we\u2019re not going to talk to you at all. That doesn\u2019t work; it was a bad idea. \u201cWhere I think Jeremy Corbyn is doing well is in showing a vision for what he believes in, and I think Conservatives have to do this.\u201d He praised Georgia Toffolo, the winner of the ITV show I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here, for publicly backing the Tories, and said it was important for the party to show that it had young and famous supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s very important the Conservative party can show that it\u2019s got followers from a variety of areas,\u201d the MP said. \u201cWe broadly expect that retired field marshals will be Conservative, but we need to show that young people, celebrities, people that can win I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here also have a connection with the Conservative party, that they see why it\u2019s attractive.\u201d Responding to Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments, May\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cI think the prime minister enjoys her job enormously and views it as a great privilege.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
