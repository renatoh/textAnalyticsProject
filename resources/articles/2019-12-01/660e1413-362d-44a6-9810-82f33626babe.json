Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: Nicky Morgan was reappointed culture secretary, despite having retired from the Commons. Morgan had said she wanted to spend more time with her family when she stepped down prior to the election. Reports suggested her return to cabinet would be an interim measure ahead of a larger reshuffle early next year. Angela Rayner is likely to seek the deputy leadership of the Labour party, numerous sources suggested. The shadow education secretary is expected to give Rebecca Long-Bailey a clear run as the left-wing leadership candidate. The government must not try to bully the BBC into submission, the broadcaster\u2019s former boss said. Lord Grade, the former BBC chairman, made the comments on Radio 4\u2019s World at One programme after it emerged that the government was considering decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, also said the BBC was partly to blame for Labour\u2019s defeat at the election. Arlene Foster said she hopes the Northern Ireland assembly will be up and running early next year. The DUP leader accepted the election had created a \u201cmomentum\u201d towards breaking the deadlock. The shadow foreign secretary threatened to sue a former parliamentary colleague for saying she once described leave voters as \u201cstupid\u201d. Emily Thornberry said she was involving lawyers because Caroline Flint had refused to retract her comments. Downing Street held the first lobby briefing since the election. You can see a detailed summary of that here. MPs have been arriving at Westminster following last week\u2019s general election that brought a decisive Tory victory. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, addressed the new intake and undertook a mini-reshuffle of his cabinet. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason have tonight\u2019s main politics story: Boris Johnson will attempt to mark his election promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by writing into law that the UK will leave the EU in 2020 and will not extend the transition period, Kate Proctor, Peter Walker and Daniel Boffey report. As MPs begin to be sworn in at Westminster on Tuesday, the prime minister\u2019s team is working on amending the withdrawal agreement bill so that the transition, also known as the implementation period, must end on 31 December 2020 and there will be no request to the EU for a further extension. A Downing Street source said: Our manifesto made clear that we will not extend the implementation period and the new withdrawal agreement bill will legally prohibit government agreeing to any extension. Here\u2019s a host more middle and junior-ranking ministerial appointments just announced by No 10: Anne-Marie Trevelyan is promoted to minister of state at the Ministry of Defence in place of Mark Lancaster. Her former role is taken by James Heappey, who becomes a parliamentary under secretary of state at the MoD. Jeremy Quin moves from his role as a government whip to become a parliamentary secretary at the Cabinet Office. David TC Davies becomes a parliamentary under secretary of state at the Wales Office and an assistant government whip. He will only be paid for the latter role. Kevin Foster is appointed a parliamentary under secretary of state at the Home Office, replacing Seema Kennedy. Robin Walker will move from being a joint parliamentary under secretary of state at the Scotland and Northern Ireland offices, to fulfilling the role solely at the latter. And Downing street has announced that the following have been removed from their government roles: Nick Hurd, who was previously a minister of state at the Northern Ireland office. Colin Clark, who was previously a parliamentary under Secretary of State at the Scotland office and a government whip. A mooted plan to merge the department for international development (DfID) and the foreign office (FCO) risks allowing British aid money to be spent on \u201cUK foreign policy, commercial and political objectives\u201d, rather than on helping the world\u2019s poorest people, more than 100 charities warn. They cited an Independent Commission for Aid Impact report (pdf) that found responsibility for the UK aid budget was increasingly being spread around Whitehall, with departments spending more and more in \u201clarge middle-income countries\u201d. The charities, which include the British Red Cross, Ocfam GB and Unicef UK, said: Merging DfID with the FCO would risk dismantling the UK\u2019s leadership on international development and humanitarian aid. It suggests we are turning our backs on the world\u2019s poorest people, as well as some of the greatest global challenges of our time: extreme poverty, climate change and conflict. UK aid risks becoming a vehicle for UK foreign policy, commercial and political objectives, when it first and foremost should be invested to alleviate poverty. By far the best way to ensure that aid continues to deliver for those who need it the most is by retaining DfID as a separate Whitehall department, with a secretary of state for international development, and by pledging to keep both independent aid scrutiny bodies: the Independent Commission for Aid Impact and the International Development Select Committee. Boris Johnson has briefly addressed the new Conservative MPs at Westminster, telling them they were \u201chere to get things done\u201d. Flick Drummond, the new MP for Meon Valley, said he was \u201cvery inspiring\u201d. He talked about how excited he was to see so many of us here. He said we are here to get things done. We are here to get Brexit done. Caroline Ansell, the MP for Eastbourne, said: There is a real energy, a real buzz. Everybody is very keen to move forward. Paul Howell, who took Tony Blair\u2019s old Sedgefield seat, said: It is a fabulous occasion. It is a new profile for the Conservative Party. We have got to deliver across the country. Morgan has joked that leaving the cabinet is more difficult than leaving the EU after it was announced she would be made a life peer to allow her to carry on as culture secretary, despite having stood down as an MP. The Labour MP, Jo Stevens, offers this criticism: Senior Scottish National party and Lib Dem figures are equally scathing of Johnson\u2019s decision to reappoint Morgan. Layla Moran is the Lib Dems\u2019 culture spokeswoman: Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant, a former shadow culture secretary, is somewhat unimpressed by Morgan\u2019s reappointment. However, as the Telegraph\u2019s Asa Bennett points out, making someone a peer in order for them to serve in the cabinet is by no means unprecedented: It also appears that Morgan may not be intending to stick around for long: Here\u2019s the letter Morgan wrote to her local party chair when she decided not to stand for election. In the letter, dated 30 October, she cited the impact serving in the Commons was having on her family life and the abuse MPs receive as reasons not to seek re-election. Morgan said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t commit to another five-year term\u201d and that \u201cnow is the time for me to stand aside and be at home far more\u201d. Now, she will serve as culture secretary as a life peer. Nicky Morgan has been confirmed as the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, despite having stood down from the Commons at last week\u2019s election. A No 10 spokesman has said: The Queen has been pleased to signify her intention of conferring a peerage of the United Kingdom for life on Nicky Morgan. The Irish foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, has held talks with the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, at Stormont. He is meeting political leaders in Belfast over the next 24 hours before an all-party round table on Wednesday, when he said he hoped they could agree a plan to restore devolution and co-operation between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Coveney said: Now is the time to get Stormont back up and running. We have had three years without any form of devolved government in Northern Ireland. It is far too long and I think we have seen the consequences of that in terms of the polarisation of politics across Northern Ireland, not just amongst political parties but also within communities. The one clear message I have got from the general election in Northern Ireland is that people have been putting pressure on all of the parties to get back to Stormont, to get back to work, to make decisions for Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland and, of course, the job of the British and Irish governments is to work together with the parties to put a foundation in place to allow that to happen, and we are running out of time. What we have now is a very real window that all of us need to take and the meetings today, from what I hear, have gone well. Certainly, the meeting I have had with the secretary of state was very positive. Coveney said Wednesday\u2019s planned strike action by nurses represented a \u201creality check\u201d for politicians. Decisions need to be made in Stormont. It is a reminder to everybody that now is the time to get this done. We will work night and day before Christmas, and again in the new year, if necessary, to help the parties get it across the line. Hart supported Johnson\u2019s bid to be Tory leader in the summer, saying the party needed a \u201cbolder choice, not without its risks, but the sort of choice which really engages people in the debate about the country\u2026 [in a way that is] eye-catching, visible and audible\u201d. On Brexit, Hart supported remain in 2016 and was one of the co-leaders of the Brexit Delivery Group of MPs who backed Theresa May\u2019s deal over a no-deal Brexit and who were seen by many in the Tory party as moderates. Speaking during the party leadership campaign, he said: I see myself as an example of somebody who has been in a pretty different place from Boris during the whole Brexit process but who fully accepts that we must now move to a conclusion. In February, Hart said the Tory party had staked its reputation on being able to deliver a Brexit deal. Before entering the Commons, Hart served as the chief executive and chairman of the Countryside Alliance and campaigned against the hunting ban introduced by the Labour government. Simon Hart, who previously served as a parliamentary secretary at the Cabinet Office, is the new secretary of state for Wales, Downing Street announces. Hart is the MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire and he replaces Alun Cairns in the ministerial role. Here are three contributions to the debate about what Labour should learn from its election defeat from prominent commentators on the left. Miatta Fahnbulleh, head of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, says in an article for the Guardian that Labour should not ditch its entire policy programme. Whatever the final verdict, the Labour party will have to change if it is to reconnect with the broad coalition of voters it needs to win back power. But as it does this, it must not lose sight of the one thing it got right in this election. Labour was right to grasp the scale of the economic and environmental challenge the country faces and offer ambitious solutions. Against the backdrop of the longest squeeze in living standards for generations, economic growth that has passed many communities by, entrenched poverty and a climate emergency, Labour offered a manifesto that began to rise to the challenge. It contained flaws, but it would have undoubtedly begun the process of transforming our economy. Those eager to reject Corbyn would be wrong to abandon this ground as well. Tom Kibasi, a commentator and thinktank boss, says in an article for the Guardian that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership was a problem. As Labour members seek to make sense of what happened, they must also confront the reality that some of the people around Corbyn trampled over the ideals of Corbynism. They destroyed the moral standing of a lifelong anti-racism campaigner by choosing to interpret antisemitism as a factional issue rather than a moral one. They prevented the heir to Tony Benn fulfilling his commitment to member-led democracy by seizing control of selections for themselves. They brought bullying, threats and intimidation to the office of a man famed for being kind, gentle and polite. This is an unavoidable part of the story of Labour\u2019s failure. The truth is that the problems Labour faced cannot be disentangled from the question of leadership. Corbyn faced a barrage of attacks \u2013 that he tolerated antisemitism, supported the IRA and other terrorists, disliked the monarchy and didn\u2019t support the armed forces \u2013 that were more ferocious than any other party leader in living memory. But the problem with Corbyn\u2019s leadership was not the things outside his control, but those over which he had full power. While he reaffirmed the values of social justice and helped Labour to rediscover its radicalism, he was unable to rise to the challenge of one of the toughest jobs in public life. And Paul Mason has posted his thoughts on the defeat in a Twitter thread. It starts here. And here are his two final posts, the last of which includes a link to his 22-page pamphlet setting out his argument in more detail. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. The Press Association photographer Yoi Mok has some more pictures from Frank Dobson\u2019s funeral. I\u2019ve now been told by three Labour MPs, and a couple of other party sources, that they expect Angela Rayner to run for the deputy leadership \u2013 though had no confirmation yet from Rayner\u2019s camp. The shadow education secretary had been widely regarded as a strong possible contender for the leadership, but has apparently decided to give her old friend and flatmate Rebecca Long-Bailey a clear run as the leftwing candidate \u2013 a gesture one colleague said was \u201csisterly\u201d. Laura Pidcock, another leftwing favourite, lost her North West Durham seat to the Conservatives last week. Tim Farron has told the BBC that he won\u2019t be standing for the Liberal Democrat leadership. He held the post between 2015 and 2017, but told the BBC that if he were asked to do it again, the answer would be a \u201cdefinite, definite no\u201d. And this is from Fay Jones, the new Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnorshire. Jones is on the left. She is beside Virginia Crosbie (centre), the new Conservative MP for Ynys M\u00f4n, and Sarah Atherton, the new Conservative MP for Wrexham. They are the first women to be elected as Conservative MPs in Wales. From Olivia Blake, the new Labour MP for Sheffield Hallam From the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for a fairer voting system, has released figures saying 14.5 million voters are effectively \u201cunrepresented\u201d because they voted for a candidate who did not win. It says: More than 14.5m voters are effectively \u2018unrepresented\u2019 according to the Electoral Reform Society, after 45% of voters rejected their local MP. The number reflects the millions who did not vote for the local MP in their area, under Westminster\u2019s \u2018one-person-takes-all\u2019 voting system. Under proportional representation, there are far fewer votes thrown on the \u2018electoral scrapheap\u2019, the ERS say. The society are also highlighting \u2018warped\u2019 results, with a large majority won on a minority of the vote. The Conservatives\u2019 vote share rose only slightly (1.3 percentage points), while their share of seats rose 7.4 points (to 56%). Labour\u2019s vote fell by 7.9 points while their share of seats fell by slightly more than that, 9.2 points. The Liberal Democrats won 11.5% of the vote but just 1.7% of seats. The party\u2019s vote share increased significantly but had a net loss of one seat. The SNP have 7.4% of seats on 3.9% of the vote. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chair, says he has suffered abuse and harassment because he argued the party had to accept the result of the Brexit referendum. And the Lib Dems have also been posing for a team photograph - which, given the numbers, was probably a bit easier to coordinate. Here is the new cohort of SNP MPs. Labour\u2019s defeat is \u2018big opportunity\u2019 to move to centre ground, says Andrew Adonis An old joke in the Labour party is that, after every election defeat, the party promptly forms a circular firing squad. Labour figures never actually end up shooting at each other although, as my colleague Rowena Mason reports, today they are threatening to sue each other - or at least one of them is. To add to the spirit of comradeliness, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock (who represents leave-voting Aberavon and who was urging the party to back a soft Brexit, not remain) told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live earlier that those in the party who backed a second referendum should apologise to pro-leave Labour supporters. And the party should choose a new leader who did not argue for a second referendum, he said. He explained: I think it\u2019s important that our next leader should be someone who didn\u2019t back a second referendum, because I think that would send a very important signal that we understand where those leave voters are coming from and how alienated they felt by those in the Labour party who tried to preach at them that they somehow did not understand what they voted for in 2016. But Andrew Adonis, the former transport secretary, Labour peer and passionate remain campaigner, told BBC News this afternoon that he thought it was not all over for the remain campaign. He said that, although the UK would now leave the EU next year, the remain cause was not \u201cgone for all time\u201d and that at some point in the future a party might campaign to rejoin the EU. I don\u2019t know about the next year or two, but because I don\u2019t believe Britain will flourish long term outside the European Union, I think the case for rejoining will come back into British politics. He said Labour should view its defeat as a \u201cbig opportunity\u201d to elect a better leader. Well, with all catastrophes come opportunities, and the big opportunity for the Labour party now is to position itself in the centre grounds of politics with a leader who is credible, who can hold the government to account, and who can do so in a way that makes people think that at the next election there will be a very real choice. Asked to say who the new leader should be, Adonis said he had not firmly decided, but he said that he had \u201calways been hugely impressed by Keir Starmer\u201d (the shadow Brexit secretary, who won\u2019t get Kinnock\u2019s vote because he backed a second referendum) and that Starmer was fit to be prime minister. From my colleague Heather Stewart President Trump has called to congratulate Boris Johnson on his election victory, No 10 has said. A Downing Street spokesman said: The prime minister spoke with President Trump, who congratulated him on the result of the general election. They discussed the huge importance of the relationship between the UK and US, and looked forward to continued close cooperation on issues such as security and trade, including the negotiation of an ambitious free trade agreement. Many senior Labour figures have been attending Frank Dobson\u2019s funeral in London. This is from Alastair Campbell, director of communications at No 10 when Dobson was health secretary. From the Sunday Times\u2019 Gabriel Pogrund Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said she hopes the Northern Ireland assembly will be up and running early next year. Speaking after a meeting with Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, she said: I listened very carefully during the election campaign and right throughout the election campaign there was a desire to get Stormont back up and running again. Therefore we are here to try to make that happen. I hope all the other parties will too. Foster accepted the election had created a new \u201cmomentum\u201d towards breaking the deadlock and reaching agreement on power-sharing. I know it\u2019s Christmas, it\u2019s that time of the year again, we have been in processes before in and around this time of the year, but I very much hope that at the beginning of the new year we will have an assembly up and running and one that can deal with all the issues we have talked about today. Foster, who said she did not believe a new assembly election was necessary before 2022, also stressed the need for an injection of money. She said reforms were required to ensure that any new executive was \u201csustainable\u201d. This is from Mark Rutte, the Dutch PM. Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, has been holding talks today with the five main parties in Northern Ireland - the DUP, Sinn F\u00e9in, the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance party - about restoring power-sharing in the province. Speaking a few minutes ago after those meetings, Smith said that every party had been \u201cvery, very positive\u201d about doing what they could do to get the Northern Ireland assembly and the power-sharing executive back up and running. So it was a \u201cvery heartening\u201d set of discussions, he said. He went on: Probably the most positive thing is there\u2019s going to be a number of bilateral discussions between the parties later today and tomorrow. And I would encourage that, because at the end of the day this is an issue for Northern Ireland parties to come together on. They\u2019ve heard the message on the doorsteps. I think they\u2019ve heard it loud and clear. And we need to get this done. By \u201cmessage on the doorsteps\u201d, Smith was referring to the anger about the fact that the executive has been suspended now for almost three years. This partly explains why both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, the two main parties in Northern Ireland who between them are responsible for the deadlock, saw their share of the vote go down in the election. On the World at One Lord Grade, the former BBC chairman, warned the government against trying to bully the corporation. Commenting on the government plan (see 1.37pm) to consider decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee (a move that could reduce the BBC\u2019s revenue), Grade said an independent report looked at this in 2015 and concluded the status quo should remain. \u201cI cannot say any new factor that would justify the government reopening that debate,\u201d he said. He went on: What worries me is any government, whether it\u2019s a Conservative government or a Labour government, using its legislative powers to threaten the independence of the BBC. I don\u2019t like that and I would always oppose that and speak out, in the Lords or wherever, against any attempt to bully the BBC through the threat of legislation. I think the British public would be up in arms about that. When asked if he thought that was what was happening, Grade said: If the reports are correct, it feels that we could be moving in that direction, and I don\u2019t like it at all. And I think any elected government should think very, very, very carefully before it attempts to bully the BBC into submission. Grade said he also thought no prime minister would want to be remembered for destroying the BBC. At the morning lobby briefing Downing Street confirmed that it would consider decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee. (See 12.08pm.) There was no mention of this idea in the Conservative manifesto, but Boris Johnson disclosed it at a campaign event on a day when he was facing intense criticism for his response to questions about the boy sleeping on a hospital floor and CCHQ was anxious to find another story that might divert journalists. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, has been defending the idea in interviews this morning (although not on the Today programme, which still seems to be the subject of a No 10 boycott). He told Sky News: We are going to look at the licence fee because we do think it is an unusual arrangement that it is criminalised. That\u2019s putting a lot of pressure, which I think is unnecessary, on the criminal justice system. It doesn\u2019t seem sensible to me that many members of the public, including vulnerable people, are being taken to court. He also said that under the current system people were \u201cending up in court for something that they wouldn\u2019t in other walks of life, if they were paying bills to other companies and organisations\u201d. Turning back to the BBC, the Evening Standard says in its splash that the corporation will respond to criticism of its election coverage by expanding coverage from outside London. In their story Joe Murphy and Sophia Sleigh report: The Evening Standard understands that BBC chiefs are already discussing how they can respond to the unprecedented backlash from both sides of the political divide. It is planning an increase in reporting and outside broadcasts from the North and Midlands, which revealed critical swings of opinion in the election, and other regions. Insiders said it will not mean opening new centres or hiring a lot more staff, but will involve telling existing stars to get out of the capital city more often and put their ears to the ground in far-flung regions. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary and a potential candidate for the Labour leadership, has threatened to sue Caroline Flint, a former parliamentary colleague, for saying that Thornberry once described leave voters as \u201cstupid\u201d. Thornberry said she was involving lawyers because Flint, who lost her seat in the election, refused to retract what she told Sky News yesterday alleging Thornberry had once told a colleague: \u201cI\u2019m glad my constituents aren\u2019t as stupid as yours.\u201d Thornberry says this is a lie. At the No 10 lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman also declined an opportunity to contest today\u2019s Times splash that says the government is going to review the way the Ministry of Defence spends billions on procurement. Asked about the story, the spokesman said the government was committed to a wide-ranging review of foreign and defence policy. He said: As the PM announced during the election campaign, the government will undertake a new integrated foreign policy, security and defence review which will extend from the armed forces to the intelligence services, counter-terrorism, serious organised crime, diplomacy and development. This will ensure we are making the best use of spending to ensure all our security forces are ahead of hostile powers, terrorists and organised crime. The Times story points out that Dominic Cummings, who has resumed his role in No 10 as Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser, has described current MoD procurement as a farce. In its story (paywall) it says: In a post published in March, before he joined the government, the former Vote Leave campaign director hit out at the programme to build the carriers, the second of which was commissioned last week. Calling the scheme a \u2018farce\u2019, he added that it \u2018has continued to squander billions of pounds, enriching some of the worst corporate looters and corrupting public life via the revolving door of officials/lobbyists\u2019. Scrutiny by MPs had been \u2018contemptible\u2019, he said, adding that the vessels \u2018cannot be sent to a serious war against a serious enemy\u2019. I\u2019m just back from the No 10 lobby briefing. It went on for quite a while, but it was not hugely illuminating. We certainly did not come away with any great new insights into the agenda of the new government. Here are the main points. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed that the government would \u201cstart the process\u201d of passing the Brexit withdrawal agreement bill before Christmas. It is understood that No 10 wants to hold the second reading debate on Friday, after the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. But it would be unusual to hold a second reading debate a day after the Queen\u2019s speech, and it is not clear yet whether the Speaker would approve this. The spokesman said Boris Johnson had now approved the intelligence and security committee\u2019s report in Russian involvement in British politics for publication. This is the report that Johnson refused to publish before the election, prompting speculation that he was suppressing it because it would be embarrassing to the Conservatives. This means the ISC is now free to publish it. But the ISC does not currently exist, because a new ISC has to be appointed when the new parliament meets, and so the report is not expected to appear until a new ISC is formed at some point in the new year. The spokesman declined to say exactly when the PM decided the report was fit for publication. The spokesman confirmed that the government would review whether non-payment of the TV licence fee should be decriminalised. The spokesman refused to say whether the withdrawal agreement bill due to be published this week would be exactly the same as the one given a second reading by MPs before the election. Asked about this, the spokesman said: You will have to wait for it to be published but it will reflect the agreement that we made with the EU on our withdrawal. The spokesman said the government would be aiming for \u201ca Canada-style free trade agreement with no political alignment\u201d in its talks with the EU on a post-Brexit trade deal. But he refused to say any more about the government\u2019s strategy in those talks. The spokesman refused to confirm that a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition period was still a possibility. Asked to confirm that this was a logical possibility if the UK and the EU failed to reach an agreement by the end of next year, the spokesman just said that it was in the interests of both the UK and the EU to get a Canada-style trade deal. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, has also given an interview to the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire. In it, he partly toned down his criticism of the BBC. He said that he was not blaming it for Labour\u2019s defeat. And he said that he treasured it. But he repeated his claim that some of its coverage was slanted against Labour. He said: I\u2019m suggesting that we treasure our public service broadcaster, the BBC, and in my opinion they have trespassed with regularity during the course of this campaign into an area that they should not trespass into. We\u2019ve had endless examples from the political correspondents of the BBC that we find very difficult to accept. Derbyshire said McDonald\u2019s use of the word \u201cconsciously\u201d on the Today programme this morning (see 9.48am) implied he thought BBC reporters were deliberately slanting coverage to increase the chances of a Conservative victory. McDonald replied: Well, when your senior political correspondent opines about the postal ballots, and says that the postal ballots are not looking good for Labour \u2013 we don\u2019t look at postal ballots \u2013 how on earth could that opinion be expressed? And why is an interpretation on what is blind at that time being interpreted as not looking good for Labour? Why is it that stories sent from Tory HQ are received by the BBC and turned into a factual story when the reality is that the Labour political activist did not punch a political adviser to Matt Hancock? Yet that was put out on the airwaves. McDonald said Labour would be reviewing what went wrong with its campaign, and he said he hoped the BBC would review its coverage too. In my view [the BBC has] been used and abused, and if we are not careful the rampant Tory party will dispense with the BBC, and sadly those who are currently in charge of it have nobody to blame for themselves. But I treasure the BBC. It\u2019s a bastion. And it\u2019s really, really important that we hold our public service broadcaster close and make sure that it is not undermined. I\u2019m afraid the way people have gone about their business during this election does not fill me with confidence. I\u2019m not saying for one minute that the BBC have caused the defeat. They didn\u2019t. But I do want us to have some reflection about this important part of our society. The Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds has criticised his colleague Andy McDonald for part-blaming the BBC for their party\u2019s defeat. (See 9.48am.) According to the Press Association, Sajid Javid, the chancellor, declared: \u201cWelcome to the people\u2019s government,\u201d as he left 11 Downing Street this morning. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, told the Today programme this morning that he thought the BBC was partly to blame for Labour\u2019s defeat at the election. In an interview with Justin Webb, McDonald said: Don\u2019t get me started on the media, Justin. I\u2019m very worried about our public service broadcaster. When Webb asked him if he was blaming the BBC for the fact that Jeremy Corbyn did not win, McDonald replied: I am saying that they played a part. I\u2019m really worried about the drift. You\u2019ve seen the catalogue of criticisms that we\u2019re making. We\u2019ve accepted that the print media are rained against us, but my goodness me. I\u2019m going to look at us. We\u2019re the important part here. We got this wrong, but if the BBC are going to hold themselves out as somehow having conducted themselves in an impartial manner, I think they\u2019ve really got to have a look in the mirror. We\u2019ve got a lot to say about this. Asked if he was saying the BBC \u201cconsciously\u201d played a part in slanting coverage against Labour, McDonald replied: Consciously, yes. When you have a BBC presenter standing in front of a television camera saying \u2018and Boris Johnson is on his way to a richly-deserved victory\u2019. McDonald seemed to be referring to the BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth, who during one live broadcast referred to Boris Johnson winning \u201cthe majority that he so deserves.\u201d From the context it seemed obvious to many that she meant to say \u201cthe majority he so desires\u201d. Webb put it to McDonald that this was just \u201ca slip of the tongue\u201d and that it was \u201cmadness\u201d to read too much into it. McDonald replied: How many slips of the tongue are we going to make until you accept it? As my colleagues Matthew Taylor and Jim Waterson report, the BBC is also under pressure at the moment from the government, with No 10 seriously considering decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, while boycotting Radio 4\u2019s Today programme over the broadcaster\u2019s supposed anti-Tory bias. Good morning. Or at least it is for newly-elected members of parliament, most of whom, of course, are Conservative. There are 109 new Tory MPs, and they have started arriving at Westminster already. The Commons is not sitting today \u2013 it does not commence formally until 2.30pm tomorrow, when MPs will assemble in the chamber to re-elect the Speaker - but MPs are coming to parliament to start the business of settling in. Here are tweets from three newly-elected Tories. From Christian Wakeford, MP for Bury South: From Aaron Bell, MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme: From Jonathan Gullis, MP for Stoke-on-Trent North: Journalists are going to have to spend the next few months getting to know the new intake of MPs, because for most of us they are something of an unknown quantity. CCHQ may be keen to learn a bit more about them too. One consequence of a surprise election victory is that it results in people who were never expected to win getting into parliament. It remains to be seen whether the new Tories, particularly those elected to represent previously safe Labour seats, will end up behaving, culturally and politically, in similar ways to conventional Conservative MPs, or whether they will be noticeably different, pushing the party in a new direction. Boris Johnson reportedly wants the party to change. According to the Sunday Times (paywall), after the exit poll was announced on Thursday night he told his team: We can\u2019t go back to being the Tory party of the old days ... This is a totally different party and we\u2019ve got to make sure everyone realises that. One of the big questions in politics over the next parliament will be whether or not Johnson does transform his party in the way he is proposing. And as new Conservative MPs arrive at Westminster, Labour MPs are preoccupied with the inquest into their defeat, and the forthcoming leadership contest. Here is the agenda for the day: 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. Early evening: Boris Johnson is due to address Tory MPs at a reception in Westminster. At some point today we are also due to get announcements from No 10 about who is being appointed to the two vacant cabinet posts \u2013 culture secretary (because Nicky Morgan stood down at the election) and Welsh secretary (because Alun Cairns \u201cresigned\u201d in the early stages of the election campaign over what he knew about the role of a former aide in sabotaging a rape trial). As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
