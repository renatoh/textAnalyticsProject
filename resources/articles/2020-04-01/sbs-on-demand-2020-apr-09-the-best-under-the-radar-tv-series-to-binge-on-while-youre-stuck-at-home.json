But it still offers the chance to immerse yourself in on-screen thrills. From highly anticipated reboots of 90s classics to ambitious historical dramas that speak to our cultural moment, here are eight under-the-radar TV series currently streaming on SBS On Demand - and why they\u2019re worth watching, now. Party of Five The 1994 Fox drama Party of Five was cult television. This much-loved show, which followed the lives and loves of the Salinger family in the aftermath of an accident that killed their parents, gave us some of television\u2019s most powerful explorations of sibling bonds. A new adaptation of Party of Five stars Brandon Larracuente, Emily Tosta and Niko Guardado as the Acosta children, who are forced to grapple with life in Los Angeles after their parents are deported back to Mexico. It revolves around a premise that could have been lifted from news headlines, but its depiction of five Mexican-American siblings who must deal with the repercussions of ICE agents raiding their family\u2019s restaurant, then the threat of further separation, is a highly moving look at lives lived in limbo. All episodes available to stream free on 10 April on SBS On Demand. Shrill Based on a memoir by Lindy West, an American columnist best known for her caustic, witty columns on gender and body positivity, Shrill revolves around Annie. She is an up-and-coming journalist who must deal with some of the common pitfalls of twentysomething existence: a boyfriend who plays video games with his roommates and a boss who won\u2019t give her creative freedom. She\u2019s also a plus-size woman who takes pleasure in her own skin. Shrill owes its revolutionary power to a protagonist who decides to love herself, despite inhabiting the type of body that\u2019s frowned on by society. But performances by Aidy Bryant and British comedian Lolly Adefope, who plays Fran, Annie\u2019s queer hairdresser roommate, make this warm-hearted series a must-watch. Years and Years The line between art and reality is getting increasingly blurry, and Years and Years is a case in point. This six-part series stars Emma Thompson as Vivienne Rook, an outsider MP who rises to power on the back of populist propaganda. It follows an everyday Manchester family as political and technological shifts send their lives spinning in directions they couldn\u2019t have imagined. The show\u2019s propulsive narrative frees the viewer from the 24-hour news cycle. It also shows us how political shifts shape us as people. The Plague The crises that define any current moment are probably not novel. Chances are we\u2019ve lived through something similar before. The Plague, an opulent series set in 1580s Seville, shows us how the spread of that era\u2019s epidemic was fuelled by the wealthy and powerful. The series is among the most expensive television productions in Spain\u2019s history, made for \u20ac10 million, an investment that can be seen in the set\u2019s attention to detail. East West 101 Zane Malik (Don Hany) is a Muslim detective who migrated from Iraq to Australia as a child. As part of his role in the major crime squad, he scours western Sydney to find out how ethnic groups are entangled in crime. His biggest problem? He must work alongside Ray Crowley (William McInnes), an old-school Anglo-Australian detective whose conservative ideas about justice play out during the course of the pair\u2019s fiery working relationship. East West 101 could easily traffic in caricatures about the kinds of men who grow up on opposite sides of the Harbour City. Instead, this critically acclaimed series is rife with surprises and plot twists. It\u2019s also a masterclass in the complications of race relations in Australian life. Planet Expedition There are few activities as escapist as armchair travel. And there\u2019s no better guide than Steve Backshall, a BAFTA-winning adventurer and naturalist who has nursed a lifelong passion for the wild. Over the course of 10 episodes of Planet Expedition, Backshall ferries viewers everywhere from the Himalayan white waters to the far-flung peaks of the Arctic Circle, stoking our sense of adventure and appreciation for nature in the process. The Little Drummer Girl Featuring candy-hued cinematography that recalls the halcyon days of the 70s, The Little Drummer Girl, directed by South Korean Park Chan-wook, blends the breakneck pace of a spy thriller with all the moody thrills of a romance. This artful adaptation of John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s best-selling novel spins around Florence Pugh\u2019s Charlie, a British actor involved in left-wing theatre who is plunged into life as a double agent, navigating border crossings, surveillance and espionage. She also falls for her handler (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) along the way. Wayward Pines M Night Shyamalan\u2019s much-anticipated move into television contains all the elements of memorable on-screen mystery: a rural Idaho setting; Ethan Burke, a secret service agent played by Matt Dillon; and a car accident that traps the protagonist, sealing him from the outside world. In the vein of Stranger Things, Wayward Pines, in which Juliette Lewis plays Beverly Brown, a bartender who shares Ethan\u2019s suspicions that something supernatural is afoot, is also heavy with references to the defining examples of the genre, with cinematography and plot twists that recall Twin Peaks and Lost. Whether you gravitate towards soulful family dramas or fast-paced spy thrillers that transport you to another time and place, stream the latest must-watch television from Australia and overseas for free at SBS On Demand."}, "isHosted": false}}}
