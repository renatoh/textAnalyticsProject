Freelance writer Ed Docx was also one of the six nominated journalists, partly for work in the Observer. Gentleman is shortlisted for a third consecutive year; Lewis was shortlisted in 2010. The director of the prize, Jean Seaton, said: \"Journalists and journalism have had a bruising, even shaming year. Yet it has also had a remarkable year of consequential stories told in quite new ways. Our shortlist represents the moral heart of reporting at its best.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
