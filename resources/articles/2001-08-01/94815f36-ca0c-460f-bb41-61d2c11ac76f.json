The advertisement implied that Henry would retire to a life of relative luxury by the time he reached his great-grandfather's age. However, Henry's great grandfather and, come to that, his grandfather and father, have been unhappy of late, having seen the value of their pensions reduced by a quarter. The plight of Henry's family is blamed on Henry's grandfather who, a year ago, took early retirement from the motor industry. While great-grandfather worked up until the age of 65, grandfather threw in the towel at 55. In a bid to increase the value of his pension fund, grandfather invested \u00a340,000 in a hi-tech company whose shares had already doubled during the previous six months. If it had been only grandfather who had done this things might not have been so bad. But private and institutional investors the world over were driving up the prices of shares of companies that never had, and never would, make a profit. Some got out before the crash, but others - including grandfather - did not. The crash brought down the value of both grandfather's and great-grandfather's pension funds. Even father was told he must increase payments into his fund if he wanted to retire in comfort at 65. It is easy to blame grandfather for the recession. After all, he is one of the baby boomers. It was baby boomers who created a mass market for toys, who made the Beatles famous and who created the fashion industry. They consumed Ford cars and caused the 1972 oil crisis. Now they are retiring early and bleeding the UK economy dry. But Henry's great-grandfather, born in 1920, just after the Great War and the influenza pandemic, is one of the original baby boomers. In 1920, there were 1,127,000 people born - the highest annual figure that century. Nevertheless the first baby boom caused little more than a ripple. It is only recently, during the past 10 years, that Henry's great-grandfather has shown up on economists' radar. Not only have he and many of his friends lived a decade longer than his pension company originally expected, but during those 10 years he has been in and out of hospital (two heart bypasses, a hip replacement and a respiratory problem brought on by smoking). Economists now believe he may be able to tell us just how long the recession will go on. Early indications are it may be 25 years before we see an upturn.That is the time it will take for Henry's grandfather to reach the age Henry's great-grandfather is today. This seems a long time but it is comparable to the number of years between the great Depression and Harold Macmillan telling us we'd never had it so good. To illustrate just how bad the situation is let's look at Henry's father. While the news that he will have to increase his pension payments is bad enough, it is likely he will, at some point, have to pay increased tax and National Insurance to pay for great-grandfather's hospital treatment. He will have to become more productive as his company must keep up dividend payments on the shares that make up grandfather's pension fund. He is also the only one in the family producing anything - everyone else, including Henry, is consuming goods. For this reason a large amount of goods are imported into Britain, increasing the balance-of- payments deficit. At some point the pound will crash, imports will cost more and inflation will erode everyone's savings. Henry's father does not expect to retire until he is 65. (Some economists in the Treasury expect him still to be working when he is 72.) And there's one other thing: Henry will start college in a few years and father has to pay the fees. The only respite for Henry's father, and the economy, will be the gap between great-grandfather passing on and grandfather reaching an age where he needs constant medical attention. There will even be a short period when the crisis within the National Health Service appears to be over. This may be the only bright spot during the next general election campaign - and, for that matter, during the remainder of Henry's father's working life. The root of the problem facing the UK economy lies in the models used to deter mine its performance. These are based on a radically different demographic profile from the one we have today. In the Sixties there was a half-hearted attempt to reform the economy by creating highly automated industries manned by skilled, well-educated workers - the so called white heat of technology. However it subsequently proved easier to expand an underclass to provide low wage workers for over-manned, low-value-added, manufacturing processes. Today we have few alternatives other than to patiently wait while the demographic profile of the UK reverts to a shape that fits the Treasury's economic models. That is not to say there won't be periods of adjustment. However these will prove painful for most members of Henry's family. Pension funds, like those of Equitable Life, will shrink to such an extent that Henry's grandfather will be forced back into the labour market. While this may be good news for the economy, Henry's father will not welcome the resulting reduction in the average wage. However grandfather's skills will no longer be relevant, and his old job will have gone, so his main threat will be to the increasing army of unskilled workers. Of course, grandfather himself will be less than pleased with the situation. While unskilled workers have never placed much faith in pensions - even when they could afford them - grandfather is bound to feel cheated. The underclass just riot and burn a few cars when they get the raw end of a deal. The middle classes tend to be more vocal and, on the whole, far more dangerous. Lastly, what of Henry himself? Well, even assuming his father can afford to send him to college, he will enter a highly competitive labour market. He will be paying high rates of National Insurance and, most likely, exorbitant (and compulsory) pension contributions. Not such an Equitable Life after all, eh Henry? Slim your ambitions, fatten your investments The potentially horrendous costs of mortgages and pensions may force us to temper our aspirations about home ownership and retirement income levels. Conventional wisdom has it that we should all aim for a retirement income of at least half, if not two-thirds, of the salaries we hope to earn on giving up work. David Oliver believes we should think more about how much we will really need, and bear in mind that it now costs more than \u00a3270,000 to buy \u00a310,000 a year of index-linked pension at the age of 55.\"It may be worth slaving away to make the difference between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000, but not to go from \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000,\" he says. \"Many people will have to accept that early retirement has become unrealistic.\" Oliver advises against the inflation-linked annuities he used in his sums because they are too expensive. Instead, he recommends a \"cocktail\" of investments that should give some protection against rising prices. \"You might have a rented flat, some equities and some bonds,\" he says. The other inescapable message is to start saving for your retirement when you are young, and to put aside as much money as you can."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
