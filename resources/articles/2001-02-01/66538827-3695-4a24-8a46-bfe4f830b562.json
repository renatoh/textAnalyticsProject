The results of the first ballots were announced yesterday among members of the two biggest teaching unions, the National Union of Teachers and the National Association of School Masters Union of Women Teachers, employed in state schools in Greater London and Doncaster. In the first wave of action, which could take place once employers have been given seven days' notice, they will introduce \"part-time schooling\" by refusing to cover for unfilled, permanent posts and staff absences of longer than three days. The disruption will be the first to hit classrooms in England since the mid-1980s, when teachers took action over extra workload triggered by the Sats tests. It is bad news for Labour so close to the expected election. Ministers said the action would be \"counter-productive\", damaging children's education, while headteachers agreed the impact would be \"devastating\". Announcing the results, the union leaders forecast that one in three schools where ballots have been held could be forced to send children home because there was no one to teach them. That could involve about 1,000 of the estimated 3,000 primary and secondary schools where ballots have been held - up to around 500,000 youngsters. The action is now set to spread to other parts of England, with further ballots in Manchester, Reading, Portsmouth, Southampton, Leicester, Middlesbrough, Nottingham and Kent. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \"Teachers in London and Doncaster have declared enough is enough; They rightly see no reason why they should paper over the cracks.\" In the first ballots, held in schools in London and Doncaster, 93% of the participants voted for action but the turnout was just 30% in Greater London and 41% in Doncaster. The education secretary, David Blunkett, warned: \"Industrial action will not solve the recruitment problem. All it will do is make the task of raising standards and engaging children's commitments that much harder. If they are out of school they are not learning and if they are not learning the challenge for teachers becomes greater and the pressure increases. \"This therefore will be entirely counterproductive. What we need is positive ideas to build on the emerging success of the recruitment policy so that we can attract teachers back into the profession now as well as new recruits from September.\" David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"The impact will be devastating. Schools will be forced to send children home because there will be no teachers willing to cover and the chances of getting supply teachers are already past praying for.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
