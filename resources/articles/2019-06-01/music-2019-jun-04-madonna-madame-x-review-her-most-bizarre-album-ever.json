Some of us are old when we\u2019re children, bringing briefcases to school and talking to adults at family parties; others leave uni with the thrill that they never have to go clubbing again. Most of us think we\u2019re doing pretty well, then we find ourselves nodding appreciatively at something in a Boden catalogue and suddenly death is real. For years, Madonna outpaced all of this. In 1996, Evita looked like ushering in her middle age, but she did an about turn, delivering convincing, idiosyncratic trip-hop on Ray of Light (1998) and convincing, idiosyncratic electro on Music (2000). Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005) was even better, its Abba samples and smooth deep house a way for her to stay out past 4am with dignity, rather than trying to score ketamine off teenage fashion influencers at the afters, musically speaking. But she couldn\u2019t run forever. Perhaps it began pre-Confessions, when she kissed Britney Spears as if to parasitically extract her youth. Certainly by Hard Candy in 2008 she was playing catch-up, spurring Timbaland and the Neptunes to some of their tamest work, a good five years after their pomp. MDNA (2012) tried to keep pace with stadium EDM, while Rebel Heart (2015) struggled to get its head around a newly global, musically cosmopolitan pop market, and just randomly glued hip collaborators together. The woman who had once led was following, and sluggishly. To her credit, she has not done what many in her position would then do: lick their wounds and sell a jazz standards album to Radio 2 listeners. With Madame X, Madonna instead grits her teeth, puts on a glitter-encrusted eyepatch, looks in the mirror with seriously reduced depth perception and says: \u201cBitch, I\u2019m Madonna.\u201d And by drawing on the Latin influence of not just reggaeton-crazed recent pop but also her new home base of Lisbon, she has, at 60, produced her most natural-feeling, progressive and original record since Confessions. It\u2019s also one of her most bizarre and sprawling, and features some of her worst ever music. Killers Who Are Partying finds this American multimillionaire \u2013 already not shy of white saviourhood \u2013 play empath to the world\u2019s huddled masses: \u201cI\u2019ll be Africa if Africa is shut down. I will be poor if the poor are humiliated. I\u2019ll be a child if the children are exploited \u2026\u201d We pause for presumably more of the same, this time in Portuguese, and then: \u201cI\u2019ll be Islam if Islam is hated. I\u2019ll be Israel if they\u2019re incarcerated. I\u2019ll be Native Indian if the Indian has been taken. I\u2019ll be a woman if she\u2019s raped and her heart is breaking.\u201d It\u2019s well intended but fails to read the room \u2013 the room here being the entire planet. The dog\u2019s dinner of Dark Ballet, aired in part at Eurovision, features vocodered vocals sung to a melody from the Nutcracker, and irritatingly gnomic pronouncements about commerce blinding us to reality. Extreme Occident, only available on the deluxe version for a very good reason, sees Madonna trying to \u201crecover my centre of gravity\u201d in a politically polarised world \u2013 a really worthwhile topic, but expressed in witless lyrics. \u201cI guess I\u2019m lost / I had to pay the cost / The thing that hurt me most \u2026\u201d (at this point you\u2019re ready to bet your house on the final line being about a ghost, but no) \u201c\u2026 Was that I wasn\u2019t lost.\u201d Tablas arrive with stupid kneejerk exoticism. It ends with her asserting \u201clife is a circle\u201d about 20 times. These shockers are suitable only for schadenfreude lovers or scholars of extreme camp, but another of these wildly messy tracks actually matches its vaulting ambition. God Control was presumably made after an all-nighter on Reddit \u2013 a rambling \u201cWake up sheeple!\u201d screed that confronts gun reform, disenfranchised youth, democracy and the man upstairs. One section has her rap \u201cEach new birthday gives me hope / that\u2019s why I don\u2019t smoke that dope\u201d, and that her only friend is her brain \u2013 all with the peppy naivety of Tom Tom Club\u2019s Wordy Rappinghood. And all of it set to hi-NRG disco with cascading strings and Daft Punk vocoders, for over six minutes. It is \u2013 only just \u2013 brilliant, and will become an equally beloved and despised curio among fans. All this baroque weirdness knocks the album off its axis, but most of its 64 minutes are actually full of very decent pop songcraft. Future is her go at pop\u2019s next big trend, roots reggae, and while there is a slight, perhaps unconscious but audible white-person Jamaican accent, it is catchy and full-bodied, producer Diplo shamelessly ripping off the brass from Outkast\u2019s SpottieOttieDopaliscious. She returns to Deeper and Deeper-style house on I Don\u2019t Search I Find, its strings and fingerclicks a clear nod to Vogue. Crazy is beautiful and brilliantly catchy, a midtempo soul ballad that you could imagine Ariana Grande singing, but which has clever detailing like an accordion that has surely been influenced by Lisbon\u2019s fado scene. The most emphatically Latin tracks are all strong, particularly Faz Gostoso with Brazilian superstar Anitta, whose frenetic beat is somewhere between baile funk and Angolan kuduro \u2013 another Lisbon-influenced rhythm that also flits through the polyrhythmic Come Alive. Bitch I\u2019m Loco, the second track to feature Colombian star Maluma after lead single Medell\u00edn, is reggaeton roughage, but will be satisfying enough booming out of a club system. Perhaps there isn\u2019t an absolutely diamond pop chorus on Madame X, but the singles I Rise, Crave, and Medell\u00edn all have elegant, sinewy melodies that twine around you rather than jabbing you into submission. Throughout, there is more density and musical adventure than at almost any other point in her career (perhaps this is the influence of Mirwais, who produces numerous tracks here and gave Music its fiendish intricacy). Her voice is remarkably plastic, pitched down one minute and up the next, into a Sia-like bleat and out into robotic polyphony. Often, around the seabed of the mix, is a swirl of aqueous psychedelic sound, profoundly different and much more interesting than her earlier R&amp;B and EDM minimalism. Killers Who Are Partying ends with the questions: \u201cDo you know who you are? Will we know when to stop?\u201d The untamed, batshit Madame X suggests that Madonna doesn\u2019t have the answer to either \u2013 and that her strength is in never knowing. \u2022 Madame X is released 14 June \u2022 This article was updated on Tuesday 4 June with a correction \u2013 Killers Who Are Partying was wrongly titled as Killers Who Are Playing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
