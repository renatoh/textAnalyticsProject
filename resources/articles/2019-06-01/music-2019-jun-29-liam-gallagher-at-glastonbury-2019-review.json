Still, Liam\u2019s Pyramid stage set isn\u2019t exactly lacking in animosity towards his ch\u00e8r fr\u00e8re: he labels him \u201ca little fart\u201d and mocks his dismissal of Oasis\u2019s greatest hits. Evidently it\u2019s not a position Liam shares, dedicating a good half of his set to the band\u2019s back catalogue. He comes on to the riff from Fucking in the Bushes, just as Oasis did at their massive Wembley shows in 2000, and performs Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Star. It feels like a territorial land grab in the face of young pretenders \u2013 later he thanks Michael and Emily Eavis for \u201cletting me continue my Glasto residency\u201d \u2013 and to a degree he\u2019s earned it: nobody looks more the part, with his hands clasped at the bottom of his spine, top lip hanging off the microphone like a rottweiler refusing to relinquish a rubber toy. Even from the outer fringes of the stacked main stage, where the speakers make the guitars of (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory sound like a washing machine on the blink, the effect is still transcendent. But how much can he lay claim to the crown when it\u2019s based on rehashing former glories \u2013 and, as Stormzy proved, when the concept of rock stardom has evolved light years beyond his 90s heyday? Tumbleweed blows across the field whenever he plays most of his solo material. The leering Wall of Glass gets a mild roar of recognition, but For What it\u2019s Worth and Bold are arduous plodders, and both find Gallagher on the defensive, his least convincing mode. He introduces a brand new song, River, presumably from his forthcoming second solo album \u2013 an announcement met with as much enthusiasm as a weather report announcing a return to the 30C weather, ie none. Coming back to Capaldi, this dull strummer of a song entrenches the age-old mystery of how such witty, quicksilver men fail to translate their verbal genius into decent songwriting. There\u2019s no escaping the fact that Gallagher is a diminished figure. The sepia colouring of the visuals either side of the stage reflect the ageing of his voice \u2013 he no longer attempts the high notes of Columbia. He\u2019s constantly jousting with an invisible antagonist, chin up as thousands of people show him their love. Fortunately for him, he still lays claim to some of the most fantastic, nonsensical rock songs of all time, the kind made to withstand wear and tear. It\u2019s hard to imagine any other act at the festival has a run of hits like Gallagher\u2019s home straight: Cigarettes and Alcohol, Wonderwall, Supersonic and Champagne Supernova, which he dedicates to the late Keith Flint. But it\u2019s also hard not to imagine how glorious it would be if the brothers finally buried the hatchet and graced the Pyramid together. For all that they like to fire shots at one another, the diminishing returns of their respective solo careers reveal two men continuing to play themselves rather than one-up each other."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
