But the British cinema has produced nothing about cricket to compare with Pride of the Yankees, Field of Dreams and The Natural, or on soccer to match Knute Rockne - All American, Any Given Sunday and Friday Night Lights. So there's been no movie season at the National Film Theatre or on TV to exploit the current World Cup fever and all the cinema can rustle up for the occasion has been a couple of curiosities, one fact, one fiction. The documentary film Once in a Lifetime, co-directed by Paul Crowder and John Dower and produced by John Battsek, co-producer of One Day in September, is more than a curiosity. Subtitled 'The Untold Story of the New York Cosmos', it's a piece of social and cultural history about how soccer, for a while at least, came to challenge football and baseball as the dominant American sport. The movie starts with America's wholly unexpected World Cup victory over England in Brazil in 1950, and the two decades that then passed before the sport started to catch on in the States. This was largely because, as someone opines, soccer was too demanding for an audience with a short attention span. Then, due to a pair of Turkish-American owners of a successful record company, a Cuban-born architect, a British manager (Clive Toye), a British trainer (Gordon Bradley), and a media mogul with ambitions to own a major sports franchise, the New York Cosmos came about in the 1970s. The media mogul was Steve Ross, boss of Warner Brothers, who knew nothing about soccer, and it was Toye who invented the name Cosmos - 'What was bigger than Metros?' he asked himself. The early days were hard going, with games played on a former prison island in the East River. The big leap forward came when Ross put up the money to bring in Pele, hired on a stupendous $4.7m contract. Brazil was reluctant to see its national hero leave home, but Henry Kissinger intervened with the Brazilian President, explaining how good this would be for hemispheric relations. Five great years followed as the team was joined by Franz Beckenbauer, Werner Roth, the divisive Giorgio Chinaglia and other foreign stars, and they moved to the enormous Giants Stadium in New Jersey. But the North American Football League overreached and the Cosmos made the mistake of going all out for TV coverage and national sponsorship. The league collapsed, Ross sold the Cosmos and the once rich and booming club collapsed. By 1985, it was just a name belonging to an Italian restaurateur. But the seeds were sown that established the game in the States and there are now 18 million children registered as players. This documentary is full of drama (one of the participants evokes Rashomon to describe the conflicting testimony of those interviewed) and fascinating anecdotes. My favourite story is told by Rodney Marsh who claims that his team, the Tampa Bay Rowdies, beat the Cosmos because they sent a stretch limo, a supply of Chivas Regal whisky and some girls to greet Pele and Chinaglia when they flew into Florida. The two stars staggered on to the field the following day and played the worst games of their lives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
