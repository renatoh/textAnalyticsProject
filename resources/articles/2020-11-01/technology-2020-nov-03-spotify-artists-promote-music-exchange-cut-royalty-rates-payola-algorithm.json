The feature, which Spotify is describing as an \u201cexperiment\u201d, will affect playlists including the company\u2019s Artist Radio, which plays songs similar to a particular band, and Autoplay, which continues to play similar music after a playlist has run out of tracks. \u201cArtists and labels can identify music that is a priority for them, and our system will add that signal to the algorithm that determines personalised listening sessions,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis allows our algorithms to account for what\u2019s important to the artist \u2013 perhaps a song they are particularly excited about, an album anniversary they are celebrating, a viral cultural moment they are experiencing, or other factors they care about.\u201d But the algorithmic juice comes at a price. \u201cTo ensure the tool is accessible to artists at any stage of their careers, it will not require any upfront budget,\u201d Spotify says. \u201cInstead, labels or rights holders agree to be paid a promotional recording royalty rate for streams in personalised listening sessions where we provided this service.\u201d The new terms sparked an immediate backlash among recording artists. \u201cThis a form of payola or sponsored social media post. It is not necessarily illegal but the tracks would need to be labelled,\u201d said David C Lowery, the singer-songwriter of Camper Van Beethoven, and a regular campaigner for musicians\u2019 rights, referring to the 1950s scandal of DJs being paid to play particular songs. Spotify\u2019s push comes just a week after the company was presented with a campaign from the American Union of Musicians and Allied Workers calling for the company to guarantee a minimum payment of 1c per stream, and to \u201creveal existing payola, then end it altogether\u201d. \u201cSpotify encourages labels and management companies to pay for plays on the platform. In many cases, the artists do not even know this is happening,\u201d the union wrote in an open letter to the company. \u201cSpotify should not be in the business of selling artists access to their own fan base. Spotify must publicly reveal where existing payola is occurring, and then stop systems of paid access that make an already unequal platform even more imbalanced.\u201d The letter has been signed by 16,000 artists so far, Umaw says. Spotify has been contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
