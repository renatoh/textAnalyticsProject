Three other primary schools will be left just metres from the new runway, campaigners against the expansion said. The playground of one of the schools will border the new runway fence if the controversial plan to build a third runway goes ahead. Campaigners say the relocation of Harmondsworth primary from the village of Harmondsworth, where it is surrounded by fields and farmland, to an area on the Stockley bypass in West Drayton, where air pollution monitors regularly breach legal limits, will harm children\u2019s health. Details of the relocation of the school are included in the airport\u2019s master plan released on Tuesday. The document states: \u201cHarmondsworth primary school will be displaced by the new runway. Land to the north of the M4 highway on Stockley Road has been identified as a suitable replacement site for the school as it is within the catchment area and has appropriate road access and connections to green areas for recreational purposes. \u201cThis site also has the benefit of being able to accommodate early delivery to enable vacation of the existing facility in time for the commencement of construction of the new runway.\u201d Rob Barnstone, coordinator of Stop Heathrow Expansion, said: \u201cHow can it be allowed for a primary school to be relocated in an area with already high exposure to toxic emissions to make way for 260,000 more flights, emitting more emissions in its former location. \u201cWe already know that emissions from Heathrow-related traffic and planes have an impact on children\u2019s learning and exam performance. Yet the airport seem quite content in doing so. Children deserve better.\u201d Details of the impact of the new runway on local primary schools are contained in the document Heathrow published at the start of a 12-week consultation on its expansion. If it goes ahead, the expansion will leave three other schools \u2013 Cherry Lane primary, Heathrow primary and William Byrd primary \u2013 just metres from the new runway. The playground of Heathrow primary will run up against the runway fence, according to details contained in the plan. Barnstone said the impact of noise on children\u2019s learning was well documented. Geraldine Nicholson, who works in a local school and is part of the campaign to stop the expansion of the airport, said: \u201cConsidering one in three children inhale toxic air in the UK, is this government prepared to do this to our children in all of these schools? The planes will be literally a few metres above the playground.\u201d As well as demolishing a school, the third runway building will involved rerouting natural waterways, moving the M25 into a tunnel and creating a car park for 50,000 vehicles. The land grab will far exceed the boundaries of the new airport during its development, with construction and earthwork sites set up. An estimated 20m cubic metres of earth will be moved \u2013 more than 1m lorry loads. Friends of the Earth is continuing its legal challenge against the expansion, after losing a high court case in the spring. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is also appealing against the decision of the high court to rule against five challenges. A spokesperson for the mayor said: \u201cA third runway at Heathrow would be an environmental disaster. \u201cGiven the impact that expansion would have on our city \u2026 we have filed the necessary court document to commence the appeal process so that the mayor can continue standing up for Londoners by opposing the third runway.\u201d Heathrow is urging people to take part in the consultation. Emma Gilthorpe, the executive director for expansion at Heathrow, urged local people to participate in the consultation and make their views heard. A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cWe will be taking consultation views on board before a final plan for expansion is subjected to a strict planning inspectorate process in 2020. \u201cWe want to further mitigate the environmental impacts of this project \u2013 that\u2019s why we are inviting the public, local authorities, schools and experts to engage with us and have their say on our master plan. \u201cWe are taking steps to improve local air quality by introducing our own Ultra Low Emission Zone, improving public transport links for communities surrounding the airport and enhancing green space with environmental projects including the 20km [12.5-mile] Green Loop.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
