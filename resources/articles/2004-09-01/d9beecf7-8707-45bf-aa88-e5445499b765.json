Here was a woman who had bedded most of the leading creative men of her time, among whom there were three \"whom she went so far as to marry\". Her story, according to Lehrer, was the stuff of which ballads should be made and, as was his way, he had composed a modest example. I mention this only because two weeks ago Audreus gave us the most gloriously convoluted clue it has ever been my pleasure to see. I repeat it here for the record only; solvers will recognise it immediately and non-solvers will raise their eyebrow in the manner of one saying, \"See, I told you these puzzles were ridiculous.\" Take a deep breath: \"In which the disappearance of a non-celebrity leads to the poet's transmogrification (3,5,7 and few could 4,4,4,6,2,2 but 3 is 2,3,5 and, oh, the 10 to 10.)\"* \"Come again?\" said my girlfriend, lapsing into the South African idiom I thought she had lost, but to which we both resort in moments of stress. I came again, so to speak, to no avail. But the best approach to these sorts of clues is to get as many checked letters as possible. Soon we had sufficient letters to get the pattern for the first three words. Wordsworth's \"Lucy\" poems have stirred much critical debate over the years, but what is certainly not in question is their power to move the reader. Lucy may well have been \"A Maid whom there were none to praise/ And very few to love,\" but her memory lingers on in our poetry and the puzzles of our newspapers, and that seems to me a more fitting claim to fame than that of the loveliest girl in Vienna. *Answer: The solution comes from this stanza: SHE LIVED UNKNOWN, and few could KNOW WHEN LUCY CEASED TO BE; But SHE is IN HER GRAVE, and oh, The DIFFERENCE to me!
