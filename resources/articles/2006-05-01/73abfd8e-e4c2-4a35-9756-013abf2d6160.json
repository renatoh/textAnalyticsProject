You know about the Battle of the Sexes and the Clash of Civilisations. Today, a new great divide is opening up. Hardly anyone is commenting on this conflict; very few people even seem to have clocked it, which is why it hasn't yet got a name. But it will shape our society and its political choices with increasing intensity as this century goes on. The conflict is already there, present if not always perceived, in contentions as diverse as nuclear power and pensions, the funding of the health service and tackling global warming. We could call it the Age War. Or the Battle of the Birthdays. Or the Clash of the Generations. The latter tag is the description of David Willetts, the clever Tory frontbencher who is the only leading politician I've come across who has been thinking intelligently about what is becoming one of the defining features of our society. Divides used to be mainly thought about in terms of class. More recently, attention has concentrated on conflicts of culture. I think Mr Willetts has spotted something his fellow politicians are missing when he argues that 'the question of fairness across the generations' is becoming even more significant than those more familiar conflicts. Here's an illustration of why. First, I'd like you to meet Brian. He is 55 and life has been pretty good to him. He read in his Daily Telegraph last week: 'Now is the golden age of seniors.' And Brian really can't argue with that. He and his wife bought their first home in the Seventies just before the great boom in property prices began to roar. Astute at trading up, their housing wealth has multiplied many times over. To think that we bought our first house for less than 20 grand, Brian will often muse to himself, as he uses the cover of darkness to defy the hosepipe ban by sprinkling the lawn of a property now worth well over a million quid. Twice blessed, Brian can also look forward to retirement in the confident knowledge that he has an excellent occupational pension. His company's final salary scheme (now closed to younger workers) will pay him two-thirds of his salary when he retires. With that to look forward to and the mortgage paid off, Brian and his wife have plenty of money to spend on holidays, hobbies and other rejuvenating pleasures. His wife is flicking through the latest edition of Saga magazine with its features commending readers to spend on cosmetic dentistry and splash out on a place in the sun. Brian has already bought a nice villa in Spain and is thinking of buying another in Croatia. (Though don't get Brian started on the subject of the European Union and immigration.) He gets particular enjoyment from driving his thirsty car. Though his kids give him a hard time about the amount of greenhouse gas he coughs into the atmosphere, Brian reckons he's owed his rewards after working hard all his life. Anyway, even if the scientists are right and the planet does curl up and die, he'll be beyond caring by the time the earth is frazzled. Today, Brian will crunch his 4x4 down the drive of his mock-Tudor mansion on his way to join a protest against the government's plans to build some affordable housing in his pretty, Home Counties village. Tonight, some of the neighbours are coming round for dinner. If it is a typical dinner party chez Brian, he will spend a great deal of time bragging about how much his house is now worth. That boasting is only interrupted by his complaints about how impossible it is for his son to afford to buy a flat. Let's meet the son. Ben is 25 and lives in London where he works every bit as hard as Dad ever did. Ben left college with big debts because he had to pay for the university education which his parents were given free. He does worry that the planet is being fried. He points out to Brian that his generation has guzzled all the oil and gas from the North Sea. That has left Britain with the unpleasant choice of being dependent on energy supplies controlled by the likes of Vladimir Putin or building a new generation of expensive nukes which leave a legacy of radioactive waste or taking a big gamble that renewables can bridge the energy gap before the lights go out. That is the price of Britain being ruled for nearly two decades by the high-consuming baby-boomer generation. Ben worries what sort of planet will be left for his children. Not that there is any prospect of him and his partner having any children in the near future. They'd love to start a family; they simply can't afford one. Even in their unfashionable London postcode, an unsmart, two-bedroom flat now costs more than a quarter of a million pounds. He and his partner will need a joint income of more than \u00a380,000 a year to get a mortgage for that. Ben often wonders whether it is even worth putting aside money for a deposit. Some of his mates have given up trying to amass the capital to buy a place of their own and blow any ready cash in the vertical drinking bar at the end of the street. The idea of saving for a pension is simply a joke to Ben. I don't contend that every older person in Britain is a Brian or that every younger person is a Ben. They are caricatures to make the point. And the point is that the age divide is becoming increasingly wide. Brian's age group have had it good like no generation before them - and perhaps like no generation that will follow them. Unlike their fathers, they never had to fight in a war. Unlike their sons, they can be sure of an affluent retirement in a home of their own. There are still a lot of poor pensioners, but that can sometimes blind us as to how much wealth is in the hands of older people as a group. Those aged over 50 now have accumulated assets estimated at \u00a3500bn. They own four-fifths of the nation's wealth. Much of the media may be besotted with the Cult of Youth, but this is truly the Era of the Older. The over-fifties are now Britain's biggest and richest consumer group. Their numbers are growing. By 2050, more than half of the British will be aged over 50. This will give that age group enormous political clout. Conversely, the proportion of young people in society is shrinking. Because the Brian generation of politicians has built nothing like enough new homes to meet demand, the Ben generation is finding it an ever more daunting struggle to get a first foot on the property ladder. In 1985, more than a third of under-25s were already home owners. By 2003, less than a quarter had managed to buy a home. Young people face a nasty choice between paying high rents for crummy accommodation, commuting life-sapping distances or living with their parents for much longer. This is in danger of becoming the Sorry generation, named after the sitcom in which the sad Ronnie Corbett character still lives with his mother into his own middle age. Forced to delay making homes of their own, the Ben generation are marrying later with the obvious consequence that they have fewer children. That is creating a vicious downward spiral. We face a society in which an ever-decreasing number of angry Bens are being asked to pay ever higher taxes to support the increasing number of demanding Brians. Unlike previous generations of older people, who tended to be deferential to power, the ageing baby- boomers are politically articulate, organised and dangerous for politicians to antagonise. David Cameron wants to appeal to young, aspirational voters. That means being serious about building more homes. He has hinted that he might no longer treat the green belt as sacrosanct. We will see whether the Conservative leader really dares risk the wrath this is going to arouse among older, traditional Tory voters in the shires. Tony Blair wants to give a big boost to the state pension. That is hailed as great for the retired and those close to retirement. But the tab is going to be picked up by younger people having to pay more in tax. As Brian's generation gets older - and they can expect to live longer than any previous generation - they will consume a lot of state services, especially health care. That's another tax bill on the young. We will have an older generation spending its wealth to make itself feel younger, while the younger generation gets old before its time. What can the young do to get a fairer deal from society? A first suggestion is that they should start voting. Politicians are increasingly deferential to the demands of older people because they turn out to vote in bigger numbers than any other age group. Politicians can more easily ignore the interests of the other end of the age spectrum because so few of the young see the point of voting. Ben should be using his vote because he can be bloody sure that Brian will. The Age War has begun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
