Hiddink steered South Korea to the semi-finals of the World Cup then resisted a cascade of lucrative offers to return to the testing ground of European club football with PSV Eindhoven. Back in 1988 Hiddink steered PSV to victory in the Champions Cup. But a 2-0 defeat on Tuesday away to Deportivo in La Coruna left PSV bottom of group C without a point. Last season PSV also ended up bottom of their first-round group but at least after two matches they had gathered one point. So far they have nothing to show after faltering at home to Monaco and then away in Spain. Hiddink was angry that his players had apparently failed to learn last season's lesson. \"We did not read the game properly and made some very silly mistakes,\" he said, reflecting on the goals conceded to Deportivo's Sergio and Walter Pandiani, who scored for the seventh successive game from a second-half penalty. \"I can promise that we will not throw in the towel. We can still finish the group with 12 points, which would qualify us for the second round. But first we have to deal with this basic lack of quality in our approach and attitude. The worst thing is, every year it is the same old story.\" The Dutch press has compared PSV to Celtic and Rangers as big fish in small domestic pools who struggle to raise their game in the international ocean. \"That is only true to a point,\" Hiddink said. \"Teams like Rangers and Celtic know how to fight for a result. We don't have that spirit, which has to come from within the players. It's not something you can coach on the training ground.\" Monaco top group C with six points from two games and owe a significant debt to the Champions League experience of Fernando Morientes. The Spanish centre-forward, on loan from Real Madrid, scored twice in Tuesday's 4-0 defeat of AEK Athens. Morientes was a Champions League winner with Madrid in 1998 and 2000 before the advent of Ronaldo. He left for Monaco on the eve of the transfer-window deadline at the end of August, whereupon Ronaldo immediately claimed the right to Real's No9 shirt. Juventus, beaten on penalties in last season's Champions League final by Milan, also boast a 100% record at the top of group D. They won 2-1 away to Olympiakos in Greece on Tuesday. The Czech playmaker Pavel Nedved scored both Juventus's goals to underline his status as a leading contender to succeed Ronaldo as the European Footballer of the Year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
