I'm a grown woman in the dawn of my twilight and it's neither attractive nor productive. It leaves me battered and drawn and beige of hue and, frankly, just robs the whole event of any enjoyment. Here's what I do: I go to pieces just before opening night. After the successful eight-week nationwide tour of Glorious, with most of the faults of a new play ironed out on the road, we were given a week off while the Duchess theatre in London was prepared for our arrival. The theatre was much smaller than those we'd grown used to, and there was no revolving stage, so the furniture would have to be moved manually between scenes and the back wall sliced in half. I used the week off to make an elaborate good-luck card for the cast and crew - a collage. It meant drawing their faces and cutting their names into neat little frames; it took enjoyable hours, tissue paper, trips to the copyists, Pritt Stick and bottles of wine. Finally, I achieved completion, ie I only left out six or seven key members of the company, a fact I realised just hours before the first-night curtain went up. Oddly, the card looked bought, not made, and I didn't have the chutzpah to say: \"Hey, I did that!\" Last Monday, three days before press night, our leading man and piano accompanist Bill Oxborough went down with viral laryngitis. He had minimally less voice than a giraffe and we were advised he might remain voiceless for two weeks. Our slow technical rehearsal on the new stage turned into a tense rehearsal for the cast with his amazingly unruffled understudy Michael Blore. We worked in chaos, crammed into inches of wing space where in the provinces we'd had acres. My dressing room, it turned out, was 67 steps up from the stage. We crawled home in the dark and then back into the pub-staleness of the theatre first thing in the morning for a dress rehearsal and the first, reduced-price preview. The time when one is allowed to make one's mistakes. Or was. For now we have the American system in practice where the critics demand to attend a preview if their other nights are already booked up with first nights. So now we have a missing actor, an unprepared theatre, Machu Picchu to climb and, la pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, Bob the bleeding builder, in the restaurant next door. Yes, the restaurant is re-opening in a few days, we are told, and nothing short of an injunction will stop them drilling deafeningly into our back wall. It's like being inside a bee's head. In between the two shows, as we sat, crumpled, in the stalls receiving our last-minute notes, I wept silent tears of exhaustion. How could something as complete as the last show we played at the Bath Theatre Royal, one week earlier, the echoes of whose glorious reception was still fresh in our ears, turn into this cockamamie cock-up? No time to ponder the metaphysical, the first preview audience are in their seats, with their honed personality laughs at the ready. Up went the curtain and off came the drill caps. \"We have these noisy new neighbours in the next door apartment,\" I was forced to purr, \"and they are passionate about renovation.\" It was a wild, hilarious evening, ending, if not in a standing ovation, then certainly in a crouching one. The second night appeared to be a convention of mime artistes. The first act played to a profound silence. As I contemplated leaving before the second act curtain up, they changed tack, cleared their collective throat and chortled for Great Britain and the Cinque Ports. Go explain! The third night - the press night - I went to bed fearing nothing but fear itself and woke at 3am with the mother-in-law of all migraines. I took the last resort - drugs - and spent the rest of the night checking myself to see how I was. In the morning, I had a face and a tongue the colour of a row of Nash terrace houses. Flowers and more flowers, presents, kisses, hugs, stupid must-do rituals from long-forgotten pacts with the gods (not to mention the stalls), followed by the show itself. Our Boy Bill was back thanks to Hippocrates, silence and antibiotics, and the cast rose gloriously to the occasion. No one drilled, although I had a fine dentist joke up my sleeve. Afterwards there was a party in a Turkish restaurant with cheese sandwiches and country and western music. Florence Foster Jenkins herself could not have arranged it crazier. Home to another night of the sleep of the just reprieved, and a morning of disbelief when the reviews were sublime. Next time, should there be one, I'm going to be hypnotised. I shall have that nice Mr McKenna put me into a trance for the last production week and he can come and snap his fingers when they're queuing up at the box office for returns. I remember reading how the late Bob Monkhouse once bought a nightclub under hypnosis - how hard can it be to break a middle-aged woman of the lifelong habit of self-sabotage? \u00b7 I've been exercising my mind on the sad and sorry subject of Princess Diana's Memorial wet patch. I don't know how many squillions have been wasted in pursuit of a place in which to be publicly maudlin, but what I would love to know is who was the nudnik who finally said, \"Yes! The winner is a thin stretch of water feature in the middle of a park already featuring natural water features, as do most London parks\"? Whatever one felt about the late princess, one has to admit she had the best nose in the world for a fundraiser. My friend Geoff had the very best idea in the world for a useful memorial to her legacy - one that might have pleased her - and that was to build, at probably half the cost of the concrete and designer water job, a purpose-built hall specifically for the use of charitable functions. In other words, a place to raise money for good causes where the cause in question doesn't lose around \u00a36,000 of the profits raised on the hire of a hall in some posh London hotel. No prizes for thinking up that little earner. \u00b7 And, finally, my newspaper reveals that Jeremy Clarkson and AA (so good they named him twice) Gill have gone to Iraq to suss out the scene for themselves. Quick, Tony; hurry up, UN - there's proof at last that Weapons of Mass Destruction are to be found in that country. Any chance of a controlled explosion?
