The debut of the new channel - to be called al-Jazeera International - has been postponed until the autumn. Wadah Khanfar, the managing director of the al-Jazeera Channel has also been named as the overall boss of the al-Jazeera Satellite Network. Mr Khanfar, a Palestinian who has managed al-Jazeera's Arabic service for the last two years, has been appointed director general and will now be responsible for both the Arabic and English networks. Increasingly seen as the international face of the Middle East-based network, Mr Khanfar has adopted a higher international profile to defend the organisation against criticism, particularly following allegations that the US president, George Bush, planned to bomb al-Jazeera. Mr Khanfar is also credited with a successful restructuring of the organisation. The new channel is expected to offer a mix of hourly news bulletins and longer reports and will be bankrolled, like the original station, by the Emir of the Persian Gulf state of Qatar. The service is expected to transmit from four regional centres in Doha, Kuala Lumpur, London and Washington with 250 journalists based in 30 countries. The channel's mainly Western journalists promise to challenge existing stations such as CNN or BBC World. In the quest for credibility the channel has signed up well-known presenters such as Riz Khan, formerly of CNN, and veteran British broadcaster Sir David Frost. The channel, credited with changing the face of Arab television news, has faced criticism from the US as well as several Arab states. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
