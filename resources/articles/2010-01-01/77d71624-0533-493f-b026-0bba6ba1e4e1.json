The patent, originally filed under the names of three French inventors, is called \"Touch Screen Device, Method, and Graphical User Interface for Manipulating Three-Dimensional Virtual Objects\" and describes \"a portable electronic device with a touch screen display\" which displays what looks to the user like a 3D layout. The key element here is that it's a multi-touch device - just like the Apple iPhone. The Baltimore Sun's Gus Sentementes has also done some fabulous detective work to show that the ownership of the patent is entirely in Apple's hands: \"According to documents filed with the USPTO, Apple obtained the rights to this patent application from three French citizens: Fabrice Robinet, Thomas Goossens, and Alexandre Moha. The inventors assigned the patent to Apple on Sept. 29, 2008. It's not clear if those citizens are Apple employees, per se. (Update: Actually, Mr. Moha is a product and engineering manager at Apple, per his LinkedIn profile; Mr. Robinet is a software engineer at Apple, again, per LinkedIn, and Mr. Goossens is an Apple software engineer (thanks to Baltimore's Bill Mill for digging up Goossens!) Regardless, searches under Apple's name in the patents database doesn't retrieve this patent, because the names of the original French inventors are still on it. (I wonder why that is? Hmmm. :-) \" As Sentementes points out, the patent points out that the reason why we all need 3D touch interfaces now is that \"...[T]here is a need for electronic devices with touch screen displays that provide more transparent and intuitive user interfaces for navigating in three dimensional virtual spaces and manipulating three dimensional objects in these virtual spaces.\" Well, of course. Even if it does look a bit like that 1980s game Battlezone (see below). Two steps forward...."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
