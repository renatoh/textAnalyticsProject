The French Open champion, having the season of her life with three titles and 35 wins from 41 matches, said on Monday afternoon she was taking no chances with the flare-up of a chronic shoulder problem and expected to be fully fit for Wimbledon next week. \u201cI\u2019ve had it since I was 16,\u201d the 23-year-old Queenslander said. \u201cIt comes up when I\u2019ve had a spike in workload. It\u2019s a bone stress injury and I need to look after it, particularly in these first few days. It\u2019s important to get on top of it straight away. I think we\u2019ll be fine for Wimbledon. We just have to be careful that we manage it properly the next three or four days, to make sure I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d Barty, who won the Nature Valley Classic in Birmingham on Sunday, said she played through the shoulder pain at Roland Garros, where seven matches on clay put the injury under strain, but it was not alien to her. \u201cIt was something that was there but I\u2019ve learned how to manage it. I pulled out of the doubles [semi-final in Birmingham] to try to give it the best chance to be ready for singles. It\u2019s smarter to take time to let my body rest.\u201d Barty said after leaving Paris she was looking forward to preparing fully on grass in readiness for Wimbledon, where she will be a warm favourite. \u201cThe more grass court matches you can get before Wimbledon, the better,\u201d she said. But her coach, Craig Tyzzer, said on Monday: \u201cWe have to monitor how much she plays. If she had played a lot this week then maybe Wimbledon is not a viable option. So this makes sense.\u201d Clearly Birmingham took its toll. Although Barty did not drop a set, she had to beat Donna Vekic, Venus Williams, Barbora Strycova and her own doubles partner, Julia G\u00f6rges. Barty, who began the day as the top-ranked player in the world, leapfrogging Naomi Osaka, said: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t sunk in yet, to be honest. It\u2019s been a bit of a whirlwind \u2013 over the last month, over the last 24 hours. It\u2019s been the most incredible time of my life, it really has. It\u2019s come around so quickly, but I\u2019ve done so much work with my team. I\u2019m so proud of them and all the work that they do, all the time and energy that they invest in my career. I do have the best team in the world.\u201d Barty\u2019s late withdrawal is a blow for the tournament, although it at least opens up the field for others, particularly the British No 1, Johanna Konta, who was on track to meet her in the third round. Konta beat the Ukrainian qualifier Dayana Yastremska 6-2, 6-4 on Monday and now faces Maria Sakkari of Greece. Andy Murray hit briefly with his latest doubles partner, the experienced Brazilian Marcelo Melo, in preparation for their match on Tuesday against the No 1 seeds from Colombia, Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah, whom Murray and Feliciano L\u00f3pez beat in the first round on their way to the title at Queen\u2019s. The former world No 1, who has been out for five months recovering from hip surgery, said the only aftershock from his comeback tournament was a stiff back. \u201cMost players, when they come back from a big operation and haven\u2019t played for five months, you\u2019d expect to be a bit stiff and sore in a few places,\u201d the 32-year\u2011old said. \u201cBut overall I\u2019m really happy with how I feel. We had a light practice today. I\u2019ll rest up and hopefully feel all right tomorrow. It\u2019s a pretty quick turnaround.\u201d One of the reasons Murray has returned to the game is so his two daughters can see what their father does for a living. But he said when he showed the eldest, three-year-old Sophia, the plate he received for winning at Queen\u2019s, \u201cshe wasn\u2019t particularly interested\u201d. He is more relaxed now than at any time in his career and determined to enjoy the moment, rather than move on quickly to the next tournament. He had wanted to sky-dive with his team after winning a title in Dubai in 2017, but they had declined. When it was put to him he might like to bungee jump off Beachy Head if he did well here, he smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019d be up for it, but I\u2019m not going to do it on my own. I\u2019d do it if all my team were up for it, although I don\u2019t know if my hip surgeon would be particularly happy with me trying that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
