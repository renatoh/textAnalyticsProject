A formal investigation into Clarke, launched by the party in August, invited at least 20 young activists to register serious complaints of bullying, molestation and blackmail. Some believed they were making their allegations on condition of anonymity, sources said. The complainants included Elliot Johnson, who is believed to have killed himself a week later and had formally accused Clarke of bullying, and at least two young women who claim they were assaulted by Clarke. The inquiry was headed by Simon Mort, a senior Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) member. But some of the complainants believe their details were leaked in early September. They say they were put under pressure to withdraw their allegations, sources said. The alleged leak has left activists angry at the way young and vulnerable people have been treated by the party, sources said. \u201cIt took these people a long time to pluck up the courage to tell their stories \u2013 many have ambitions to work in politics and some wanted to give evidence under a guarantee of anonymity. And then, somehow, those names were given to Clarke,\u201d a source said. Clarke was expelled from the Conservative party for life last week after it was claimed that his behaviour was a factor in Johnson\u2019s death. He ran the RoadTrip2015 campaign, which transported young activists around the country. He has told the Guardian that he vigorously denies any wrongdoing. One complainant has told police he was targeted by a blackmail plot days before he was due to give evidence to Mort as a witness to Clarke\u2019s alleged sexual assault of a young female activist. The 19-year-old told police he was persuaded to perform a sex act on the internet and then asked to hand over money. When he refused to do so, the footage was posted on Facebook, he has claimed. Kent police have confirmed that they are investigating a blackmail allegation. In a statement to the Guardian, Clarke said: \u201cI welcome any police investigation into this matter. I was also targeted by this [same] fake account.\u201d As the scandal has engulfed the Conservatives over the past few weeks, party chiefs have been seeking to distance themselves from Clarke as senior MPs have made serious allegations against him. Robert Halfon, deputy chairman of the party, has alleged that he was warned that Clarke could try to blackmail him about an affair with a Tory activist. Ben Howlett, a Conservative MP, has also spoken out about warning the party leadership about Clarke\u2019s behaviour and says he felt personally bullied in a way that affected his health. Clarke was praised by David Cameron for his work for the RoadTrip2015 campaign during this year\u2019s election. It emerged on Monday that CCHQ chiefs were sent a critical dossier about Clarke as a candidate, written after he stood in Tooting in 2010, raising concerns about his alleged aggression and hostility. The Conservatives are under scrutiny about whether they properly investigated verbal complaints about Clarke. Questions have arisen after the party released a statement to the BBC last week saying it had been \u201cchecking and rechecking, but [had] not been able to find any records of complaints that were made but not dealt with\u201d before it launched the investigation into Clarke in August. However, a statement released a day later inserted the word \u201cwritten\u201d, with the party saying it was \u201cunable to find any written complaints of bullying, harassment or any other inappropriate behaviour during this period that were not dealt with\u201d. A Conservative spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the names of Clarke\u2019s accusers were leaked. \u201cAn investigation is currently under way and it is not appropriate to comment until we can establish the facts,\u201d she said. Johnson, 21, a Nottingham University graduate who worked for the campaign group Conservative Way Forward, was found dead on railway tracks at Sandy station in Bedfordshire on 15 September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
