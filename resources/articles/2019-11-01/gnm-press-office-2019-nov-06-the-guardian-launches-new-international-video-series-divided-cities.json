Each episode focuses on a different global city, exploring issues including migration, nationhood, economic systems, the climate crisis and food access. The series will run over a period of five weeks on the Guardian\u2019s website and on the Guardian\u2019s main YouTube channel. Readers can watch the trailer here or read the series summary below: Episode 1: Melilla, the Spanish port in north Africa, one of the biggest entry points into Europe for sub-Saharan African migrants, who scale the fences in daring nighttime climbs, and where an angry conflict is developing over whether to build a Trump-style wall. Episode 2: Havana, Cuba, where citizens are split by which of the two official currencies they earn \u2013 the private sector currency is worth 25 times the state one. Episode 3: Nicosia, Cyprus, the last divided capital in Europe, where we follow young people from both sides of the UN buffer zone who are risking prison by rejecting the 45-year dispute between their Greek and Turkish elders and saying no to military conscription. Episode 4: Memphis, Tennessee, where residents living in \u201cfood deserts\u201d are fighting for what seems a basic human right in the richer half of the city: a supermarket. Episode 5: Delhi, a city on the frontline of the climate crisis and riven by \u201cenvironmental apartheid\u201d into those who can protect themselves from the deadly heat waves and suffocating air pollution - and those who must suffer and sometimes die in these conditions. The series was created by Anetta Jones (producer), Jess Gormley (executive producer) and Chris Michael (Guardian Cities editor), and directed by filmmaker, Max Duncan. Chris Michael, editor, Guardian Cities, said: \u201cGuardian Cities is the world\u2019s premiere website for global urban journalism and a hub for sharing ideas about the future of cities across the planet.\u201d \u201cAt a time of great political and social polarisation, our new Divided Cities series uses our deep experience with international reporting to tell the stories of five cities that reflect some of the world\u2019s most troubling divisions \u2013 and of the ordinary people transcending those boundaries against the odds.\u201d Charlie Phillips, head of video, the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of the powerful series that Jess, Chris and Anetta have produced. Divided Cities uses real-life stories to depict the often invisible forces behind divisions, and makes important links between a diverse group of cities around the world where unexpected kinds of division are making life more complicated.\u201d \u201cThe Guardian has developed a strong reputation for award-winning visual journalism and we\u2019re seeing record engagement with younger audiences in particular.\u201d Divided Cities is part of the Guardian Cities project supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. The series is editorially independent and clearly identifies the support provided by the organisation. The Guardian has seen success with documentary formats - in March this year the Guardian-commissioned documentary, Black Sheep, was nominated for an Oscar in the Documentary Short Subject category. Guardian documentaries have also been nominated for Grierson Awards and International Documentary Association awards. -ends- For more information please contact: media.enquiries@theguardian.com or 020 3353 3696 Notes to editors About Guardian Cities The Guardian\u2019s Cities section was launched in 2014 to create a fresh and engaging hub for reporting and discussing urban life and the future of cities around the world.
