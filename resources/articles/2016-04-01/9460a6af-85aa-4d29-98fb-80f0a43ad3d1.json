The sector has been warning the government that the offer, while attractive to working parents, is under-resourced and will lead to a significant funding gap for many providers. The study, conducted by the Pre-school Learning Alliance \u2013 the largest early years membership organisation in England, found that 49% of providers who took part in their online survey said there was a risk that they could close as a result of the doubling of the free childcare offer for three and four-year-olds from 15 to 30 hours. Almost half (48%) said they would have to cut the number of places they offer to other age groups, and 50% did not feel confident they would have the capacity to meet demand for places. Of the 1,500 childcare providers who took part, 30% are planning to deliver the 30-hour offer; while 19% say they aren\u2019t planning to, with just more than a half still undecided. Six out of 10 of them said they thought the new offer, which is due to be introduced next year, would have a negative financial impact on their business. Neil Leitch, the alliance\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThese figures are a stark warning of what could happen if the government insists on rolling out an underfunded, under-resourced free entitlement offer.\u201d He welcomed government plans to increase average early years funding rates, but said that with extra costs elsewhere, including the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, there would still be a funding gap for early years providers. \u201cThe Department for Education seems to be working on the assumption that the sector will simply fall in line and roll out the offer, whether or not the funding is there to support it \u2013 but it cannot expect providers to put the sustainability of their businesses at risk to fulfil a manifesto promise that they didn\u2019t make and that wasn\u2019t properly thought through in the first place,\u201d Leitch said. \u201cThe fact that 98% of survey respondents currently deliver the 15-hour offer, but only 30% are definitely planning to deliver the 30-hour offer, speaks volumes.\u201d Last month the National Audit Office warned that the education department faced a number of risks with its implementation of the new 30-hour entitlement, including concern from childcare providers about funding. MPs on the public accounts committee are expected to raise some of these issues when they question the department about the potential impact of the policy on Wednesday. A department spokesperson said the average funding rate paid to providers was being increased by an additional \u00a3300m a year. \u201cLatest figures show 1.3 million children \u2013 the vast majority \u2013 are taking up the universal 15 hours offer,\u201d they said. \u201cWith our plan to double the free childcare offer for working parents, we expect take-up numbers to rise. \u201cThat ambition is supported by the huge levels of interest in our early implementers scheme which will trial the 30-hour offer a year ahead of schedule in parts of the country with nearly 100 local authorities and 1,700 providers all asking to take part.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
