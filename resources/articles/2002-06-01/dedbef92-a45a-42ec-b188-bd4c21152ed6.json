Dr Spencer Olham (Sinise) is a government scientist in the year 2079, when ordinary human rights and civil liberties on Earth have been suspended in the face of imminent interplanetary invasion. Olham has just completed work on a new post-nuclear weapons system when he is arrested by the security services and accused of being a replicant: a flawless human body-casing for a time bomb, installed by the invader-spies after killing the real Olham. Olham frantically denies the charge, but the replicants are supposed to be so perfect that they themselves think they are the real thing. Olham escapes, but he - and we - are tormented by this conundrum: is he an innocent man? Or is he an unwitting robot-assassin, destined to destroy everything he holds dear? Director Gary Fleder contrives an interestingly Orwellian gloom for his embattled cities, complete with state posters proclaiming \"Victory At Any Cost\". The film sags in its second act, between Olham's arrest and the twist ending. But it's interesting, high-IQ sci-fi, and if ever a film spoke to America's post-September 11 paranoia, this one does."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
