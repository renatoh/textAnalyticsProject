The survey was carried out over a seven-month period, canvassing 1,152 people across roles in sports administration at national governing bodies, leisure organisations, county sport partnerships and sports charities. Ruth Holdaway, the chief executive of Women in Sport, has described the findings, which included 30% of women saying they had experienced inappropriate behaviour from men, as hugely significant. \u201cWhat really concerned me was the overarching 40% of women having experienced discrimination \u2013 that is a problem we have to solve urgently,\u201d Holdaway said. The survey also highlighted problems such as the gender pay gap, feeling undervalued at work, a lack of opportunities for women to progress into more senior roles and a networking culture that supports jobs for the boys. \u201cNone of us want to work in a sector where that is the case,\u201d Holdaway said. \u201cHow will we attract women into our sector if 40% feel they\u2019re held back by being female? We\u2019d never been able to quantify that before. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown there is an issue here. Women are experiencing something different from men and it\u2019s preventing them from progressing. Now we can start to build consensus around making that change.\u201d Including a male perspective was essential to bringing about change, according to Holdaway. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve chosen to talk to men and women in the industry, so we\u2019ve got interesting data about men\u2019s perceptions about gender and the gender gap and how that\u2019s different to how women perceive it. \u201cThat tells a lot about why the problems exist. If men are in the leadership roles and can\u2019t perceive the problems then they can\u2019t fix them.\u201d Women in Sport\u2019s influential Trophy Women research helped to bring about targets for women on sports boards in 2012. In April this year Manchester United announced Collette Roche, formerly the executive director of the Manchester Airports Group, as its first female chief operating officer in, while the Football Association has added two non-executive directors in the lawyer Rupinder Bains \u2013 the first Asian representative at the top table \u2013 and the Buildbase chief executive, Kate Tinsley. The research, titled Beyond 30% - Workplace Culture in Sport, provides a new focus. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got mandated targets of 30% women on boards for all sports organisations,\u201d Holdaway said. \u201cTo be compliant with sports governance code and be able to access public funding all organisations will have to have 30% women on boards. That\u2019s step one. But we\u2019ve always known that is never going to be the solution. \u201cWe want women all the way through the organisations. What\u2019s significant about this report is this the first time anyone has looked at the barriers impacting women from top to bottom.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
