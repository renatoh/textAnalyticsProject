Taylor, one of the world's most sophisticated artists in his field, has latterly been influenced as much by classical as jazz - and listeners of either persuasion will find his albums pleasing to the ear. He can, however, be rather ruminative, and though many of these tracks have a pristine beauty and a remarkable subtlety of structure, they also operate in a private sphere. Close to Mars, for instance, is Bill Evans-like in its glistening top lines and languid rhythm, and the melancholy countermelody and gracefully dancing treble figures of Starting Point are a hypnotic combination. The outstanding track, though, is Fantasy, an impulsive mix of driving, low-register melody and percussive sound effects, which is worth buying the album for alone. Escapade, too, is great, its Abdullah Ibrahim chords climaxing in a thunderous rhythm. In short: the sound of a still maturing master at work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
