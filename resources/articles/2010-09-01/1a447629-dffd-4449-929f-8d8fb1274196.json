After only a brief announcement on Twitter to her 6.4m followers, Lady Gaga made an appearance at the rally at Deering Oaks Park in Portland, Maine on Monday evening, part of a campaign to scrap the government policy that bars gays and lesbians from serving openly in the US military. Wearing a relatively conventional suit and dark-rimmed glasses, and speaking in front of a giant American flag, the singer told the crowd: \"I thought equality was non-negotiable,\" and explained: I'm here because they inspire me... I'm here because 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' is wrong, it's unjust and fundamentally it is against all we stand for as Americans. Lady Gaga's choice of Maine was significant because the rally was designed to put pressure on the state's two moderate Republican senators, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, to support a vote on Tuesday on the bill allowing the repeal of DADT, which is currently being blocked by Senate Republicans using a procedural tactic known as the filibuster. If one of the two Maine senators support allowing a vote, and break the filibuster, then the Senate could join the House of Representatives in passing the legislation, as early as this week. Two hours before the rally Lady Gaga tweeted: \"On my way to Deering Oaks Park, I have been writing my repeal DADT rally address for 48hrs. It's called \"THE PRIME RIB OF AMERICA.\" In her address the singer expanded on her choice of title: Equality is the prime rib of America, but because I'm gay I don't get to enjoy the greatest cut of meat my country has to offer. Maine's Morning Sentinel liveblogged the event, which included speakers from the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network and Maine Democratic representative Chellie Pingree. Her Maine appearance was part of a flurry of activity by Lady Gaga aimed at supporting the repeal of DADT through pressure on Congress, including this video released last week:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
