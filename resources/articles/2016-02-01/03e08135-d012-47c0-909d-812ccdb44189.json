If ever there was a fixture where actions speak louder than words it is rugby\u2019s oldest international contest, particularly when Murrayfield is rocking and England are in danger of finishing second. It has not happened for a while \u2013 2008 to be precise \u2013 and it is now a decade since Scotland even won on the tournament\u2019s opening weekend. On the back of an encouraging World Cup, however, the thistle is bristling again and Edinburgh\u2019s breezy streets are awash with \u2013 among other things \u2013 optimism. Proud Eddie\u2019s army are about to receive a serious hurry up, win or lose. That was certainly the confident prediction from the Scottish camp on the eve of battle. Ross Ford, the hooker set to win his 95th cap for his country, is not the type to make wildly extravagant claims, so when he advised England to brace themselves for on-field \u201cchaos\u201d it felt like a genuine health and safety warning. \u201cSomething we always look to do is create chaos, both in defence and attack,\u201d murmured the big-shouldered Edinburgh forward. \u201cWe need to operate at a tempo and pace which allows us to bring that chaos. It\u2019s something we tried to do at the World Cup and it worked well for us. Hopefully we\u2019ve improved since then and can show that when we kick off.\u201d It is almost a throwback to the rampaging days of John Jeffrey, Finlay Calder and co, when Scottish rucking was a thing of rugged beauty, at least for those not lying on the floor at the time. The modern game has long since outlawed boots on bodies but in the Kiwi-born John Hardie and Hong-Kong-born John Barclay, Scotland still have a pair of classic, fast-moving open-sides hoping to cause havoc at the breakdown. Factor in a much-improved Scottish set piece, the giant Gray brothers in the second row, a sharp-witted pair of half-backs and the dangerous Mark Bennett in midfield and there is the potential for the most high-profile Scottish comeback gig since the Bay City Rollers. Should it stay dry \u2013 and the forecast is less biblical-looking than a few days ago \u2013 the hosts will certainly look to play at pace and test out the theory that England\u2019s forwards have completely recovered from their World Cup travails. \u201cWe all know applying pressure on the other team is how you get an advantage,\u201d confirmed Nathan Hines, the former Scotland and Lions lock now working within Vern Cotter\u2019s management team. \u201cEngland\u2019s scrum isn\u2019t exactly bad and we\u2019ll have a big job to make sure we have parity and look after our own ball. But it\u2019s not rocket science \u2026 you try and get your forwards in the game and try and win their ball. It\u2019s not a difficult game really, is it?\u201d Helping to bring some order to all the aforementioned chaos is the \u201cother\u201d Richie Gray, the former South Africa coaching assistant who has been hired by his native country as a breakdown specialist. Ford is a big fan \u2013 \u201cIt is small detail that makes the big difference: body position and that kind of thing\u201d \u2013 and there seems little doubt that England\u2019s back row, not least James Haskell at seven, will have their hands full. \u201cBoth Hards and Barclay are brilliant on the ground at slowing things up and getting turnovers,\u201d continued Ford. \u201cIf they see the opportunity they will go for it.\u201d What Scotland \u2013 possibly with their fingers crossed \u2013 insist they will not be doing is actively winding up the new England captain, Dylan Hartley. Hines, no stranger to a touch of enforcing back in the day, reckons it would be \u201ca waste of energy\u201d and warns against \u201cchasing English shadows\u201d although he did not entirely rule out the visiting skipper being offered a few choice words of advice. Among the best rugby sledgers in his personal experience was South Africa\u2019s Victor Matfield \u2013 \u201cVictor was quite good when Bakkies Botha was next to him\u201d \u2013 but, on this particular occasion, the Scots are determined to remain calm and not donate England any easy points. \u201cYou have to understand that when you\u2019re on the pitch you can\u2019t go all fire and brimstone,\u201d stressed Ford. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to think about things and make sure your judgment and skills aren\u2019t clouded by trying to be the big man and all that guff.\u201d Stir it all together and Jones\u2019s first assignment will be a revealing one on several fronts. Four years ago Stuart Lancaster\u2019s England required a charge-down try from Charlie Hodgson to edge a slightly fortunate win; last year at Twickenham the Scots were leading early in the second-half. Whoever kicks England\u2019s goals \u2013 Jones has yet to confirm his preference but Owen Farrell will presumably be handed the tee initially \u2013 will need to be spot on; likewise the visitors\u2019 discipline. Either way a hard day\u2019s night awaits, with no guarantee of success should Scotland play with the freedom they displayed against Australia in the World Cup quarter-finals. The people of the Highlands have just been voted the happiest in the UK; there will be further trebles all round if England stumble down a rare Calcutta Cup black hole.
