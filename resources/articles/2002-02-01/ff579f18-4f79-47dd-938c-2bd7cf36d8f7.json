United confirmed in a statement to the Stock Exchange that Ferguson had agreed to extend his tenure until June 30 2005, by which time the most successful manager in English football will be 63. The deal is understood to worth \u00a311.5m, about \u00a373,500 a week, making him easily the best-paid manager in Britain, ahead of Leeds's David O'Leary. The biggest motivation for the Scot, who has won 14 major trophies since he took charge in November 1986, remains to make United Europe's premier club. \"I know the pressure at this club,\" he said yesterday. \"In the main, though, I've had 15 years which I have thoroughly enjoyed.\" \u00b7 Hull City parted company with their manager Brian Little with \"immediate effect\" yesterday, after the former striker had spent less than two years in the job. Hull, still in the Third Division play-off zone, have won only four of their last 15 games. \u00b7 Jim Jefferies, the former Bradford and Hearts manager, is expected to fill the Kilmarnock vacancy left by Bobby Williamson's move to Hibernian this week. \u00b7 Manchester City have completed the \u00a32m signing of the China defender Sun Jihai from Dalian Wanda. The 24-year-old has agreed a 3-year deal and is expected to arrive within days. \u00b7 Middlesbrough have signed the 31-year-old French midfielder Mickael Debeve on a short-term contract after he was released by Lens. \u00b7 Crewe's Trinidad and Tobago goalkeeper Clayton Ince has signed a 3-year deal which will keep him at Gresty Road until 2005. West Bromwich Albion's Jason Roberts will not play again this season after breaking his left foot for the third time in seven months. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
