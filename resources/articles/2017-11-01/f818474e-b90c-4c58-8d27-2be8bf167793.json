No more TV and radio departments. It\u2019s all about \u201cteams\u201d grouped around four topics: news, regional, entertainment and innovation. The 3,000 broadcasters, journalists, producers and technical people who work to produce all this content are still getting their heads around where they sit and who they report to. ABC TV\u2019s Media Watch program, for example, has been slotted into the entertainment team after almost ending up in news, which could have been an awkward fit, given it has to critique the news output. Media Watch will report to the former Sydney Morning Herald editor Judith Whelan, who has lost the silly title \u201chead spoken\u201d she had in radio and has been renamed head specialist. As such, she will look after science, arts, education, most of the Radio National programs and Media Watch. Whelan, whose background is print, reports to the director of entertainment and specialist, David Anderson. While we\u2019re on silly titles, the new structure has thrown up these two: ABC Life Lead (Scott Spark) and GIG Lead (to be confirmed). Aunty\u2019s cash register Now let\u2019s take a look at what the hired guns who helped design the complex plan got paid. According to the ABC annual report, during 2016-17 the corporation spent $1,546,463 on consultancies for advice on everything from redundancies to technology, finance, property and strategy. The highest paid consultant, apart from McGees Property, which provided $217,118 worth of property advice, was one \u201cJ Rudder\u201d, who earned a tidy $178,750 for five months\u2019 work. Jim Rudder, a veteran consultant to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s global pay-TV company, Sky, was hired last year by Guthrie, who also worked for Rupert between 1994 and 2007, at various companies including the former BSkyB in London, Foxtel in Sydney and Star TV in Hong Kong. Rudder joined Fox Sports Australia in April this year after handing in his report to Guthrie. During a Q&amp;A session at the Screen Producers\u2019 Association conference in Melbourne on Thursday, Guthrie referred to the debate about ABC salaries with a lighthearted remark appreciated by the audience. \u201cABC presenters are not paid more than Lisa and Karl,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they are certainly not paid as much as our cousins at the BBC.\u201d That\u2019s for sure. The highest-paid presenter is female and earns about $400,000, Guthrie said earlier, while Lisa Wilkinson and Karl Stefanovic are on $2m packages. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, is moving ahead with legislation to force the ABC to disclose the salaries of presenters who earn more than $200,000, in line with a deal he made with One Nation to pass the media laws. Legislation won\u2019t be necessary in the case of the Radio National presenter Robyn Williams. The 73-year-old, who has hosted the Science Show since 1975, chose to disclose his pay to his listeners at the end of a program. \u201cThe Science Show is produced by Bella Tropiano and David Fisher,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m Robyn Williams, gross salary $127,400.\u201d For a highly accomplished man whose name is synonymous with the ABC and who was voted one of Australia\u2019s National Living Treasures in 1998, it\u2019s a relatively modest package. If the government ever does force the salaries to be made public, the disparity between radio and television hosts \u2013 and between high-profile local radio stars such as Jon Faine and Richard Glover, and some Radio National presenters \u2013 will be stark. Murdoch\u2019s mysterious measure At News Corp\u2019s annual general meeting in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Rupert Murdoch singled out the Australian newspaper as one of the global media empire\u2019s great successes. \u201cI think the big three successes we have are the three big national papers \u2013 the Wall Street Journal, the Times in London and the Australian,\u201d Murdoch said. That\u2019s despite the Australian arm of the business being singled out this year as a reason for the company returning a second quarter loss of $287m, and the Oz never having been as successful financially as tabloids such as the Herald Sun and the Sunday Telegraph. Once a well-staffed paper, the broadsheet has been hit by staff cuts every year since and has had to close overseas bureaus and lay off photographers. The Australian did announce recently that it had exceeded 100,000 paid digital subscribers. Under the former editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell, the Australian was the first of Murdoch\u2019s antipodean papers to launch a digital subscriptions model, on 24 October 2011. Murdoch also said the digital disruption had made the newspaper business a struggle and he had no plans to buy any more. Tele on a roll with affront pages The Daily Telegraph has had a shocker with its front pages this week. It\u2019s front page on the same-sex marriage front page on Thursday marked the historic event with a photograph of Al Bundy from the 1980s sitcom Married with Children. And a day earlier, the Tele covered the announcement that Kristina Keneally was running for federal parliament by repeatedly calling the former premier of New South Wales a \u201cgirl\u201d. As in: \u201cKristina Keneally: From \u2018nobody\u2019s girl\u2019 to Bill\u2019s star girl as ex-premier announces run at federal politics.\u201d Voller suing News Corp and Fairfax Dylan Voller, who is suing the NT government over his treatment while detained in Darwin\u2019s Don Dale juvenile detention centre, is also suing News Corp and Fairfax Media for defamation in Sydney. A directions hearing has been set down in the supreme court of NSW for 24 November before Justice Lucy McCallum. McCallum is the same judge who presided over the cricketer Chris Gayle\u2019s win when he sued Fairfax Media for defamation. Knott\u2019s landing The Fairfax journalist Matthew Knott has won the inaugural David Charles Nason journalism scholarship, which supports an Australian digital, print, broadcast or multimedia journalism student interested in studying in the US for one year. The UTS journalism graduate, who is studying a master of arts in political journalism at Columbia University in New York, was awarded $20,000 by the American Australian Association to assist with living expenses in the Big Apple. The award is named after the Australian\u2019s former New York correspondent and bureau chief of the Adelaide, Brisbane and Northern Territory offices before he died in 2011 from cancer aged 57."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
