I\u2019m standing on London\u2019s Fleet Street outside an imposing door that\u2019s sandwiched between a solicitor\u2019s office and Ye Olde Cock Tavern. I feel nervous and sticky-palmed. A message pings into my phone. It\u2019s from my 17-year-old daughter. It says: \u201cTry not to worry Dad, it\u2019s only an hour and then it\u2019s over forever, and you never need to do it again. Love you!\u201d I swallow hard and ring the bell. There\u2019s no going back. I\u2019m about to have my first ever singing lesson. In the same way that some people are non-drivers or non-swimmers, I am a non-singer. I do not sing. Other than croaking out Happy Birthday or groaning through the occasional hymn, I just don\u2019t sing. Like so many people, early criticism of my quavering vocals cut me to the quick and turned me into a life-long mimer. My lips move, but the volume is set at zero. Two events stand out. In the first I am seven years old. I\u2019m in the gym and one by one we are summoned to walk across the wooden floor to the music teacher, who sits behind a piano. When we get there she plays two notes and asks which is higher. To me they sound the same. I take a random guess\u2026 and the whole class collapses into hysterics. I walk back across the floor with my cheeks on fire. In the second event, answering the headmaster\u2019s call that the choir needs more members, I join my friends for an open practice session. It\u2019s all very jolly. Half way through Kumbaya My Lord, a teacher puts his hand in the air and melodramatically cries: \u201cHalt!\u201d Has he been wounded? What\u2019s happened? He swivels round slowly and singles me out: \u201cYou! No thank you!\u201d My friends collapse in hysterics once more and my cheeks explode into colour. That\u2019s it, I think, never again. I\u2019m not sure why I felt the shame of being a bad singer so acutely. I\u2019m rubbish at all kinds of things. My football, cooking and dancing are all laughable, but I don\u2019t care what anyone else thinks. If they don\u2019t appreciate my aubergine surprise, more fool them. So why am I so stumped by my singing? I once heard a critic describe Bob Dylan\u2019s voice as like a truck reversing out of a gravel pit. And that hasn\u2019t held him back. When I announced my plan to have a singing lesson, I was met with various responses by friends and family. None were positive. One asked what my aim was: \u201cWill you go busking?\u201d she said, before laughing at her comic genius. Another asked me to record a before and after \u2013 rubbing his hands at the aural car crash in store. My wife wondered what I might ask to sing. \u201cHow about La Donna \u00e8 Mobile from Verdi\u2019s Rigoletto?\u201d she joked. Actually, my goal is less lofty. I want to sing a line or two from any song, with no one listening, but in an unselfconscious way. Surely, even for me, that\u2019s achievable. I hear someone coming to answer the door. If there is a piano in a small room and the teacher plays a couple of notes, I\u2019ll just walk out. The door swings open and Michael Vickers greets me with a warm smile. \u201cCome in,\u201d he says, and leads me into a small room with a piano. He runs his fingers over a few keys and I think I might faint. Then, somehow, even I realise this is all quite ridiculous, and I pull myself together. Michael\u2019s students are on the whole not like me. They are, in fact, opera singers. \u201cMostly I work with professionals and ensembles across the UK and Europe,\u201d he says, though he does make the point that he often works with amateurs and teaches a range of styles. If my throat was dry before, it now feels like sandpaper. We get started by tackling the great question that perplexes all non-singers. \u201cNo one is tone deaf,\u201d Michael assures me. \u201cUnless, possibly, you have a hearing impairment. We can all detect shifts in tone and inflection. It\u2019s just a case of learning to recognise that.\u201d Maybe there is hope for me after all, I think, as I shift awkwardly on the piano stool. I\u2019m particularly dreading the moment when I have to open my mouth and go: \u201cLaaaaa.\u201d The prospect feels insurmountable. But Michael outflanks me by getting me to hum first. He plays three ascending notes on the keyboard and then, in his caramelly baritone, sings: \u201cHmmmmmm.\u201d To my amazement I find myself joining in. His voice is so firm and beguiling it\u2019s all I can do not to follow his lead. We go up and down several scales and then he turns to me and says, \u201cThere, that wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d No, actually, it wasn\u2019t. I quite liked it. How odd. We talk about why people feel so shy about singing. Michael thinks it\u2019s because our voice is so intimately bound up with who we are. \u201cIf people say they don\u2019t like your singing, they are effectively saying they don\u2019t like your voice, which is then the same as saying they don\u2019t like you.\u201d He might be right. I\u2019m a terrible cook, but cooking isn\u2019t me. If you don\u2019t like the slop that I serve up it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like me. \u201cIt\u2019s why I always start with humming. You are putting less out there so you feel less vulnerable.\u201d He then points out that truly great singers are not so much the ones with the most technically perfect voices but the ones who let their voices be vulnerable. \u201cThink of Adele,\u201d he says, \u201cher emotion is carried through in every note.\u201d It seems bizarre that Michael, my vocal coach as I now think of him, is talking about my singing and Adele\u2019s singing in the same sentence. After more humming and a fun sliding game where we make our voices helter-skelter up and down an imaginary slide, Michael ups the ante by opening his mouth and replacing the hmmmmmm with a teeth-baring eeeeeeee. Up and down we go. My eeeeeees sound good to me and Michael is encouraging. The eeeeeeees give way to babababababas \u2013 they\u2019re great fun, and up and down we go again. We take a break from the scales and Michael explains where people so often go wrong. \u201cWe tend to think that singing requires something different from speaking, so we contort our throats and chests to make the noises we think we should be making. But singing is about communication and emotion, just like speaking is. What we need to try to do is use the same voice for both.\u201d Back to the keyboard, but I\u2019m now feeling pretty cool. I\u2019m beginning to relax. I\u2019m just going to use my speaking voice as my singing voice \u2013 and put like that it suddenly doesn\u2019t seem so daunting. \u201cRight,\u201d says Michael, \u201ctime for some actual words.\u201d We ease ourselves in with some counting: one, two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one. More up and down stuff. Always holding the last note for a few beats. This is my favourite bit so far. I\u2019m wondering where all this is going. In some ways, I think, I\u2019ve mastered this and would now like to quit. I\u2019ll go to weddings and just go bababababa or maybe do some counting and everyone will be happy. Michael has other plans. \u201cI think we should sing a song now,\u201d he says. I am stunned. A song? But what did I think? Singing is for songs. It had to happen. He leafs through a stack of papers. I wonder what he\u2019ll pull out. I\u2019m a big country and western fan, and I\u2019ve always thought Willie Nelson has a shocker of a voice so maybe that would work\u2026 but no, it\u2019s the Beatles. \u201cHow about Yesterday?\u201d Michael suggests. He explains that we tend to sing in either chest voice or head voice \u2013 and men cope better with a chest voice. Yesterday lends itself to that perfectly. I feel the fluttering of panic in my chest. While Michael gets ready at the piano, I clear my throat about six times. Would Adele do that? What about Willie? Michael starts singing and playing the piano. It\u2019s really lovely. I\u2019d like to sit here and just listen to him. After one go through, he nods at me and, to my utter disbelief I hear: \u201cYesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away\u201d coming out of my very own throat. I\u2019ve smashed it. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ve conquered, but I feel I\u2019ve struggled over some splintery old wooden fence into a bright new place where I can sing \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t matter what it sounds like. I tell Michael he is at this point the first and only person I\u2019ve ever sung in front of in such an earnest way. I\u2019ve astonished myself. He is delighted. Later that day, I cycle home. I reach the top of the long final downhill to where I live. It\u2019s a glorious summer evening and I let the brakes off and freewheel. And as I do, at the top of my lungs, I sing: \u201cYesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away.\u201d The London Singing Institute offers lessons and courses in all genres of music in one-to-one and group sessions.
