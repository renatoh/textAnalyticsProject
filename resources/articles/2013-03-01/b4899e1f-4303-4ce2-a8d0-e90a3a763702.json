Or to be dragged down by the weather. But at least it will haul itself back up on the final Saturday, when Wales entertain England in Cardiff. It will not necessarily be a case of winner takes all, since England should improve their points' difference on Sunday against Italy and presumably be in a position to lose the last game and still take the title. If that were to be the case, the moment when Chris Robshaw raises the trophy in front of the crowd at the Millennium Stadium will be theatre enough on its own. Come to think of it, if England win the grand slam in Cardiff the reception will be interesting. It is so long since Wales played there that they may well feel like strangers in their own home. Their reconstruction has been carried out on the road, in Paris, Rome and Edinburgh, which may be an argument for not having the title settled on points difference. Quite what would constitute a fair way of splitting teams that finish equal on points after five rounds remains a moot point but, as long as the weather is such a contributing factor to the style of play \u2013 and the climate in Rome is generally kinder than in Scotland in February and March \u2013 points difference seems an erratic way to decide the winner. Wales of course can always shut their roof, but if they are away from home for three rounds that advantage does not count for much. The question of sorting out the overall winner is probably not as important in the long run for Wales as the business of restoring self\u2011belief among the players. Having started with a determination to put an end to a run of seven defeats, their first half against Ireland might well have plunged them into a complete loss of sporting faith in themselves. Instead, they showed a resilience and a strength of character that have relaunched their ambitions and elevated them to this position of vying, however fantastical the mathematics, for the title. The revival began with a sort of desperation against Ireland in the second half, but then adopted a less flamboyant face on the road. The game in Paris has been largely declared a stinker for its lack of cultivation but Wales were more than happy with their scrimmaging and defence. And even happier to use the same platform to beat Italy and add, to boot, two tries to make the margin of victory comfortable. And on Saturday in Scotland it was the steely approach that again brought its rewards even if the scoreboard statistics \u2013 all those penalties and just the single try \u2013 tell of a lack of poetry. Maybe the uncompromising and unromantic approach by Wales is reason enough to give the title to England, should both teams finish on equal points after the showdown. England have generally played with wit. But to be adventurous at home remains easier than squeezing out the victories on the road. Perhaps Craig Joubert could have shown a yellow card earlier than the one shown to Paul James in the 79th minute at Murrayfield. What was it, 19 penalty attempts at goal and just the one yellow? That's a strain on the tolerance of any audience, however bad the weather. Referees remain very much in control of their games' capacity to deliver scores and, again, points difference may not be the fairest way to decide the overall champion. George North was back at his best against Scotland, a timely reminder of his strength at the right end of the season. He did not manage to make the try-scoring pass at the end of his first\u2011half break, but at least it took Wales into the area of maximum threat and not long afterwards Richard Hibbard plunged over. It has been a season when breaks against Scotland \u2013 by North, Luke Marshall, Keith Earls \u2013 have not been converted instantaneously into tries, and perhaps England may say that if you do not take your chances you cannot really carp about the injustice of points difference. Over five rounds, the whims of referees and the changes in the weather tend to even themselves out for the competing teams and they end up where they end up because that's where they deserve to be. So, perhaps we should simply look forward to Saturday as a grand finale to a championship that started with a bang and has slowly grown a little cold and wet. England have illuminated Twickenham and will go to Cardiff in the driver's seat. Wales, let's face it, do not need the motivation of victory by, say, 40 points to win the title on points difference. When it comes to the annual game against England you can shove points difference up where Swing Lows don't shine. Three victories on the road have restored the faith, and the simple fact of being at home and in with a shout when England come to town will do for the moment. Just to see Sam Warburton \u2013 he's back \u2013 against Chris Robshaw will do. Toby Faletau against the Vunipola brothers, his cousins \u2013 Toby played with Mako in Pontypool Under-11s. Everywhere you look there will be confrontations to savour, points to be made \u2013 for the making of the occasion, not the destination of the title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
