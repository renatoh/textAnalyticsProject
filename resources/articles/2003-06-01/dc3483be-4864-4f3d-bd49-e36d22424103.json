A banqueting hall in Addis Ababa was filled with Ethiopia's elite, who had come to pay homage to Bob Geldof at the end of his visit. Then he stood up and said the unsayable. The musician-turned aid activist is famous for his outspoken approach, but this speech was different. There were no f-words, no rage against western indifference, and no appeals for cash. Instead, Geldof paid gracious tribute to the beauty and dignity of Ethiopia and its people before sticking a rhetorical knife in their leaders' ribs. Come to a health clinic with me tomorrow, he said, and together let's take an HIV test. There was a moment of silence as the room absorbed his words before, hesitantly at first, applause began, swelling into a standing ovation as people realised that they could get away with applauding. Two of the individuals singled out by Geldof, the president, Girma Wolde Giorgis, and the Orthodox patriarch, Abune Paulos, sat in stunned silence. The patriarch, in particular, had a face like thunder. An aide seated to his left quailed and stopped clapping when he saw his boss's fury. Geldof had laid an elegant trap, first praising political and religious leaders for their efforts in Ethiopia's most recent humanitarian crisis, and then inviting them, as friends and allies, to accompany him to a clinic. The prime minister, Meles Zenawi, and the mayor of Addis Ababa, Ato Arkebe Equbai, were also invited. This took place late last month, at the end of Geldof's week-long return trip to the Horn of Africa to raise awareness and money for yet another food shortage. The Live Aid organiser was the state's guest of honour, and to say that his HIV challenge embarrassed the hosts is an understatement. They were mortified: just what he intended. It was a stunt, but not really for publicity. The foreign press ignored it, as did the local press, not wanting to irritate their rulers. Geldof probably knew that the chances of his offer being accepted were zero, but this was an opportunity to jolt Ethiopia's elite. At least 2 million Ethiopians - some say it is more than double that - are infected with HIV, the virus which causes Aids. As the drought-fuelled food shortage worsens, so people's immune systems weaken. HIV-related opportunistic infections turn bodies skeletal. A massive, complicated and expensive response from the west and Africa is needed, involving trade reform, the waiving of patents to make cheap drugs, and the cash to build clinics and pay doctors and nurses. Notwithstanding limited funds and infrastructure, Ethiopia could make an impact by encouraging people to be tested, promoting abstinence and condoms, and easing the stigma for those seeking treatment. It could. Mostly, however, it does not. Aid agencies and government health officials privately complain about a complacent, lacklustre and rudderless campaign which allows the pandemic to widen unchecked. The same is true of many other African states, with apologists usually citing two reasons: governments are overwhelmed with other pressing problems, and conservative values inhibit the approach to dealing with what is, largely, a sexually transmitted disease. Critics respond that few problems are more pressing than one that wipes out your population and that, if sexual issues embarrass you, then tough. Get over it. Uganda and Botswana are taking bold steps, and Kenya's new government is making promising noises, but many other countries, Ethiopia among them, lack leadership. There are committees, commissions, initiatives - the paraphernalia of HIV/Aids campaigns - but seldom do public figures speak out in the manner of the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni. It would cost treasuries nothing for ministers to litter public pronouncements with information about the need to be tested, to practise safe sex, and to support those who are infected. But they do not do so, because it might be embarrassing and annoy the Orthodox Christian Church. Ethiopia's civil society and media are too anaemic to prompt the government into change, while western aid agencies and diplomats are not in the business of provoking their host. Enter Geldof. In private meetings with government officials, as well as at press conferences and banquets, he pleaded for more action. Did it work? The patriarch, president and prime minister did not go for an HIV test, the local press did not report his challenge, and there was no official admission that more could be done. Mr Meles, the prime minister, assured Geldof that he regularly spoke out about Aids, prompting scorn from seasoned observers who have not heard him utter a word. If nothing else, the pop star made officials squirm, and maybe ponder the fact that they could do more. Hardly a breakthrough, but better than nothing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
