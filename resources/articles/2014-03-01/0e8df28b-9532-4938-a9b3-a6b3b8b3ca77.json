Please don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t watched episode two. If you have seen further ahead in the series, please do not leave spoilers. \u2022 Read Gwilym\u2019s episode one recap here. Let\u2019s talk about Marty Hart. Granted, that might seem a strange starting point for discussion in an episode that sees Hart\u2019s infinitely more attention-grabbing partner Rust Cohle suffer trippy hallucinations, wax lyrical on birth and death, and smack someone about the head with a toolbox. But, fascinating as Rust is, he is also an out-of-towner, with a redacted file full of wild stories and a way of looking at the world that is entirely his own. He\u2019s an outlier, and as such, doesn\u2019t really aid our understanding of what makes this dark, despairing Louisiana \u2013 described by the Guardian\u2019s Sam Wollaston as the uncredited star of True Detective \u2013 tick. Hart, though, is more firmly rooted in this universe. While Cohle\u2019s unfurnished flat suggests a man who is just passing through Erath, Louisiana, Hart is firmly in situ, bringing up a family there. He espouses the same God-fearing, old-world values that seem to govern the state itself. He\u2019s a man with a code, a way of doing things. Of course, this is all hokum. Hart is as hypocritical as they come, a man who preaches the importance of family but who has a mistress on the side. In reality, his belief system, his way of doing things, is little more than a means for maintaining power over the people in his life, and when people fail to bend to his will, he tries to bully them, both physically \u2013 pinning Cohle to a locker when Cohle makes it plain that he knows Hart is having an affair \u2013 and psychologically, using the threat of the serial killer in his attempt to keep his mistress indoors, away from other men. As much as anything, this episode of True Detective\u2019s preoccupation is masculinity, and the ways in which men seek to control the world around them. Men like Hart don\u2019t like prostitution, the madam of the bunny ranch where Dora Lange worked tells him, because \u201cyou don\u2019t own it the way you thought you did\u201d. And while that assessment paints a somewhat simplistic picture of just who benefits from prostitution, it\u2019s certainly accurate in its assessment of Hart, a man who looks to box the women in his life \u2013 wife, daughters, mistress \u2013 in ever-more restrictive little compartments. Home life, Hart tells his wife, \u201cis supposed to be what I want. It\u2019s supposed to help me.\u201d Equally, he expresses his annoyance that his mistress (Lisa, the court reporter from episode one), wasn\u2019t in one night when he drove past her house, as if her sole function in life is to be ready and waiting to service him. Hart\u2019s flimsy excuse for his infidelity is that it helps him \u201cdecompress\u201d; to act as a buffer between his wholesome family life and the dark nature of his work. He\u2019s certainly better at distancing himself from his job than Cohle, who we see stumbling around in the dead of night, asking sex workers whether they knew a Dora Lange. Cohle throws himself into his work in a manner that feels unhealthy. In the present-day interrogation, he reveals that he switched to homicide after a lengthy period in the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area force, where deep undercover work led to him developing a narcotics addiction. That is the root cause of the strange psychotropic hallucinations (beautiful smears of colour in the sky, flocks of birds forming occult symbols) we bear witness to throughout the episode. We also learn that, in between his HIDTA work and his current posting, Cohle spent time in a mental institution. The root cause of this behaviour? The death of his daughter, killed in a road traffic accident several years before. In the episode\u2019s most striking monologue, Cohle confesses that part of him is pleased his daughter didn\u2019t have to suffer life in its extended, excruciating form. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a beautiful way to go out? Painlessly as a happy child,\u201d he says to his interrogators. It is an opinion justified somewhat by the evil he has witnessed in his job, from the man injecting his infant daughter with meth to the Lange killing itself. Yet the looks the two investigating officers give in response suggest not sympathy, but horror, and you do wonder just how seriously they consider Cohle a suspect in these killings. Still, in the original 1995 investigation Cohle\u2019s obsession over the case is beginning to bear some fruit: the aforementioned toolbox assault on a pair of garage workers leads to one of them revealing the address of the bunny ranch, which leads Hart and Cohle to find Lange\u2019s journal, which in turn directs to the burnt-out remains of a church, where they find a giant piece of graffiti of a naked, antlered woman, unsettlingly reminiscent of Lange in her sacrificed state. It is vindication for the slow and painful process of lead-chasing the pair have undertaken so far, and something to take to their major, who is becoming frustrated with the glacial pace of the investigation (not to mention the more erratic aspects of Cohle\u2019s personality), and wants to palm it off to a separate squad tasked with investigating \u201canti-Christian\u201d crimes. But there\u2019s still no sign of a suspect, and much remains unanswered. We\u2019re no clearer to establishing a link between Lange and Fonteneau, the girl who went missing five years earlier. The significance of those sculptures remains unknown. And just who is the \u201cking in yellow\u201d Lange mentions in her journal? Theories please. Loose threads and other observations After Cohle\u2019s mention of \u201ccarrying out the little girls\u201d in the opening episode, Hart refers this week to \u201ca big throwdown in the woods\u201d. Are they referring to the same event? And when are we likely to see it? I briefly touched on how Cohle and Hart\u2019s characters have changed physically in the intervening years (Hart doesn\u2019t look too different, Cohle looks like hell), but what about their personalities? Cohle, who now lives \u201cin a little room in the country, behind a bar\u201d, feels far more at peace with himself (\u201cI know who I am,\u201d he tells the investigating officers). Again, Hart acts largely the same as he did in 95, still clinging to his old-world values and pining for a time where \u201cmen didn\u2019t air their bullshit to the world\u201d (a veiled dig at Cohle\u2019s philosophising persona, perhaps?). After the Reverend Tuttle made a personal appearance in the police station last week, we now see just how powerful organised religion is in the town, as the \u201canti-Christian crimes\u201d task force takes a personal interest in the case. Lange\u2019s mother\u2019s migraines, which came on just as she was asked about the church, seemed a little convenient to me. And what about that photo on her dresser? Were those men in hoods Klansmen? Or perhaps something more occult? Quotes of the week Hart: \u201cIf it\u2019s one of those tent revival places they\u2019ll move around.\u201d Cohle [deapan]: \u201cYeah, tents usually do.\u201d \u201cMost of the time I was convinced I lost it. But there were other times that I thought I was mainlining the secret truth of the universe.\u201d Cohle reflects on his \u201cvisions\u201d in the wake of the discovery of the graffiti."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
