Since being elected to the post in 1986 he has pushed for reform of the TUC, where he was president in 1998, as well as comprehensive training rights for British workers. With a fervent belief in the economic benefits of full employment, he has also been involved in the campaign for a higher state pension linked to earnings, and outspoken in his opposition to the government's policy on privatisation of public services. John Walter Edmonds was born in south London on January 28, 1944. His father was a shop steward and his mother worked for a local paper company. After Brunswick Park primary school, he won a London county council scholarship to Christ's Hospital near Horsham, then another scholarship to study history at Oriel College, Oxford. He was later awarded an honorary doctorate in law by Sussex University. He joined the GMB's forerunner, the GMWU, as a research assistant in 1965 after a short spell with a food company. In 1972, he became the GMWU's youngest national industrial officer after four years as the union's southern region organiser. His brief included the gas, electricity, nuclear energy, food, timber and packaging sectors, as well as the NHS and conducting negotiations on behalf of local government and disabled workers. Plain-speaking and experienced, his campaigning zeal on behalf of the GMB's 700,000 members from both the public and private sectors has continued since he joined the union. During his three terms of office - he was re-elected as general secretary in 1991 and 1996 - he has overseen the opening of a GMB office in Brussels, the first British union to do so. He also campaigned for early entry into the euro and better protection for European workers. He chaired the TUC committee on European matters and was a member of the European TUC executive. Politically, he is not afraid to tell the Labour government what he thinks of their policies, particularly if they do appear to tally more with Conservative thinking. At a May Day rally in Glasgow this year, Mr Edmonds told his audience about the \"death\" of New Labour and a return to traditional Labour values, which is said to have caused some concern in Downing Street. As a member of the Labour party national policy forum, he was keen to update the unions' relationship with the party. Away from the workplace, Mr Edmonds cites cricket as his favourite sport and carpentry as a hobby. His favourite book is said to be Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens, which he says contains \"everything you need to know\" about Britain's class system."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
