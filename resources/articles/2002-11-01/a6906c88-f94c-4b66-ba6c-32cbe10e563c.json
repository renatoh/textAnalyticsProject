After crowd trouble marred the first two games won by the visitors, the third was halted with India looking set to overhaul a target of 301. India were 200 for one after 27 overs with opener Virender Sehwag on 114. Play was stopped and players sent off the field after the West Indian fielder Vasbert Drakes was hit on the leg by a bottle thrown from the stands. The match referee Mike Proctor, who awarded India the match after the West Indies refused to return, rushed to the field and asked the players to go to the dressing room. \u00b7 The off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq helped Pakistan to a 119-run victory in the first Test against Zimbabwe in Harare with a day to spare. Saqlain bowled a marathon spell of 31 overs on the fourth day as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 310, chasing a victory target of 430."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
