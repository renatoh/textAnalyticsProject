Cristiano Ronaldo will be making a return to Old Trafford with the \u00a388m recruit\u2019s new side as a result of Juventus being drawn in the same Champions League group as United, and Mourinho believes the Italian club\u2019s summer spending is a sign of their naked ambition. \u201cThey don\u2019t hide,\u201d he said admiringly, having previously gone public with his own disappointment at United\u2019s failure to land more than one of his transfer targets. \u201cJuventus are always a big candidate in the European competitions but the investment they made shows they want to win it this time. \u201cWe are going to try to win, even against that big team, even though Cristiano is still a top player. I think he likes to come back here, he did when he was with Real Madrid, but of course when he returns with a new team he comes to do a job. For them.\u201d Mourinho wanted at least one more central defender in the summer transfer window, with Harry Maguire and Toby Alderweireld among the names mentioned, and though his grumbling about the club\u2019s parsimony appeared to unsettle his back line in the defeats by Brighton and Tottenham, he still maintains that defensive errors are all that stands between United and a good start to the season. \u201cWe want to play the way we did in the first half against Tottenham,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that match we were really strong and really positive against a very good opponent and we could tell Spurs were finding it hard, but two defensive mistakes in five minutes cost us the game. \u201cTo be really good offensively you have to be solid at the back, all the best teams are, because that is what allows you the confidence to take risks. We are willing to play in a way that carries risk, but if you make mistakes in defence it breaks the dynamic.\u201d Alexis S\u00e1nchez is expected to be back in the starting lineup when United travel to Burnley on Sunday but will not be joining up with the Chile squad for their two Asian friendlies during the international break. Mourinho said: \u201cIt is his own decision, I never ask players not to play for their country or interfere with selection. Alexis had a good pre-season but then picked up a small injury, and he feels he needs a couple of weeks after Burnley to put himself in good shape.\u201d After surprising everyone in the early weeks of last season, Burnley have made an even slower start than United this time, with one point from three games. Burnley can probably handle successive defeats, however, whereas at United it makes everyone nervous. \u201cI said before the start of the season that matching what we did last season was going to be difficult,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI knew that because finishing second last season was difficult. If I say it again now it is not because of two defeats. \u201cWe have lost six points but there are still 30-odd games to play. We would have liked to have made a better start but last season we won our first four games and then lost a couple of matches. Maybe this time we will have the defeats first and then the consecutive victories. My only target at the moment is to win at Burnley and then win against Watford [on 15 September], and then we can start thinking of the Champions League.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
