Asked about his appetite to continue as the manager of Manchester United, Van Gaal said: \u201cThis question I shall never answer.\u201d Yet he has always cited supporters\u2019 belief in him as a prime factor in his desire to continue. As he walked from the pitch after Saturday\u2019s defeat he was loudly booed, the first time the Old Trafford supporters have been so vocal against him at a league match. He said: \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed I cannot reach the expectations of the fans. They have, or they had, great expectations of me, and I cannot fulfil them, so I am very frustrated.\u201d Although this was United\u2019s first defeat since Boxing Day their performances have been tame. This unconvincing form and the defeat to Southampton that leaves them five points behind Tottenham Hotspur in the final Champions League berth means Van Gaal\u2019s position is again in jeopardy. When United lost 2-0 at Stoke City on Boxing Day Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, chose not to sack Van Gaal despite Jos\u00e9 Mourinho being available. The Portuguese remains keen to manage United. Jorge Mendes, Mourinho\u2019s agent, was forced to brand a report the former Chelsea manager had written to United to outline his credentials as \u201cabsurd and ridiculous\u201d. Yet Mourinho\u2019s availability only serves to increase the pressure on Van Gaal, as do the comments of United\u2019s non-executive director, David Gill. \u201cClearly we all hope the results will be better \u2013 everyone\u2019s disappointed, I feel as much as non-executive director as a fan,\u201d Gill told the BBC. \u201cThis is undoubtedly a season of underachievement. I think everyone would agree with that given the investment that was made. Everyone there is working extremely hard to turn that round. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d Yet Van Gaal argued that given he has spent \u00a3250m-plus United should be better. \u201cWe have also sold a lot of players,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still, you know that when Manchester United is coming, we have to pay much more than another club, so that\u2019s also an analysis, and it is not rubbish what I am saying.\u201d Gill was also critical of the playing style. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say it\u2019s that attractive \u2013 for me, what we did in the past was great. You have to tell the players to do that. United, going back to the 50s under Matt Busby, have had that \u2013 and I started supporting when we had George Best. We want attractive football and I\u2019m sure we will try to do that going forward.\u201d Gill would not answer if Van Gaal might be removed. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me \u2013 I\u2019m not the spokesperson for Man Utd. I\u2019m not going to be drawn on those questions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not privy to the conversations. We had great success under Sir Alex Ferguson and we want that to continue. There\u2019s great strength in the club, the deals that they\u2019ve done has given a really stable base and everyone is working hard to bring back the success years. We all want that.\u201d Van Gaal agreed United should be playing better. \u201cYes, because we want to be in the top three, and we\u2019re not in the top three, and now, after today, our competitors have won, so it\u2019s a setback,\u201d he said. But he was unable to offer any explanation as to why United are so poor. \u201cYou cannot say it is that aspect or that aspect, because there are different aspects that play a role and we are not very lucky with our injuries,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nevertheless, we had to win, and we could have won, but it is not happening.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
