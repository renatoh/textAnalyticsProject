The teenager, believed to be a Loyalist, suffered severe head and arm injuries during the explosion and died later in hospital, police said. Police said the device exploded in the man's hands causing him to lose most of his right arm when it exploded in Brougham Street near the Duncairn Gardens. The spokesman added: \"A number of police officers saw a man move forward with what appeared to be a pipe bomb in his hand. It exploded in his hand causing injuries to his head and arm.\" Loyalists, however, said the home-made bomb was thrown at them by Republicans. Eddie McClean, a Protestant community worker from the area, vehemently denied that the youth was preparing to throw the bomb when it exploded. \"The blast bomb was thrown over from the Republican side. He picked it up to throw it away when it exploded. The police are very quick to make assumptions,\" he said. He claimed the trouble began at noon when nationalists attempted to disrupt a Remembrance Day service in North Queen Street. In contrast, Sinn Fein North Belfast MLA Gerry Kelly denied that the pipe bomb had been thrown by Republicans. \"I can tell you with absolute certainty it was not thrown from the nationalist side. The bomb was at the loyalist end.\" Mr Kelly claimed the trouble began in the morning when loyalists taking part in a Remembrance Day Service in Tiger's Bay attacked Catholic homes. He said a wholesale riot broke out around 5pm when loyalists attacked the nationalist crowd. \"The police fired plastic bullets at nationalists. A young lad aged ten was hit in the leg and a girl aged 11 or 12 was hit in the stomach. She has gone to hospital,\" he added. Police and army in full riot gear today moved into the area of Duncairn Gardens and North Queen Street - the scene of furious rioting in recent months - when sectarian clashes began. The situation remained tense tonight as security forces swamped the area to keep rival factions apart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
