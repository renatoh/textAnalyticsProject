Currently, the Federal Drug Administration, which regulates blood banks, prohibits any man who has had sex with another man since 1977 from donating blood because, according to the agency, they are at \u201cincreased risk for HIV, hepatitis B and certain other infections that can be transmitted by transfusion\u201d. The policy was crafted in the early 1980s in the midst of the Aids crisis, but as faster, more reliable testing for the virus has become available \u2013 and as the country\u2019s attitude towards gay and bisexual Americans has become more progressive \u2013 activists and scientists have pushed for it to be changed. On Thursday, the Health and Human Services Advisory Committee on Blood &amp; Tissue Safety &amp; Availability voted 16-2 in favor of allowing men who have had sex with other men to donate their blood if they have been celibate for one year. This is in step with countries like the UK, Canada and Australia, which call for deferral periods of between one and five years since the last sexual encounter. \u201cThe system, in my mind, has been very successful, in part, I believe, because the public has trust in the system and the decisions we make,\u201d said Jay Menitove, chairman of the advisory group, told Bloomberg Businessweek. \u201cTo maintain that trust and compliance on the part of the public, it is time to modernize.\u201d Their decision will be forwarded to a group of advisers with the FDA for consideration at a meeting in early December. The FDA is under no obligation to adopt the group\u2019s recommendations, but their advice is considered influential, Bloomberg reported. Reactions were mixed, with some hailing the vote as the end of an era, and others upset that a celibacy period would still be required."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
