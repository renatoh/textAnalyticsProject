The club confirmed his departure in a pithy 49-word statement. \u201cI don\u2019t expect people to write me a wonderful epitaph but I thought it was very disrespectful. Having said that, I moved on very quickly. It\u2019s not scarred me.\u201d Pearson says it how it is and, while he makes clear he was upset and initially shocked, on the day he was dismissed there were telltale signs his reign, which included beating Manchester United and halting Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten run, was coming to an abrupt end. \u201cBy the time I had got a missed call and rang the person [Filippo Giraldi, the technical director] who rang me, and said: \u2018You\u2019re not ringing to sack me, are you?\u2019 it was clear, and I\u2019d already rung Craig [Shakespeare, his assistant] to say: \u2018By the way, I\u2019ve got a missed call and I\u2019ve been stopped from going into the training ground by the security guards, already.\u2019 I rang Shakey and said: \u2018Look, I think we\u2019re in trouble here but I\u2019ll ring you back in 10 minutes.\u2019 I did, and we\u2019d been sacked.\u201d He says he half-expected such volatility \u2013 his exit led Watford, who went on to be relegated, to appoint Vladimir Ivic their 13th permanent manager in nine years \u2013 but there are more layers to Pearson, a philosophical character, than football. We touch on everything from Marcus Rashford\u2019s inspirational work to the Peak District and paddle boarding but begin by discussing health. Pearson contracted coronavirus in the spring and the effects laid him low for some time, with heart problems coming to light during the Premier League restart, but the 57-year-old says he is far healthier now than when in the thick of the relegation battle. \u201cI feel OK, I think I look all right,\u201d he says, smiling. Pearson has been keeping busy. He has contributed towards the Football Association\u2019s new diversity code and continues to make the most of the scenery on his doorstep near Ivybridge in Devon, home for much of the past few months. Time out from management previously translated into hiking trips across the Highlands and Transylvania, where he had a hairy encounter with a pack of wild dogs, but recent weeks have been rather more serene. \u201cJust along the way here there are some stables and some friends of ours go horse riding a lot and I said: \u2018Well, any chance?\u2019 I went for a couple of hours the other week and it was great. Hopefully, I will get back out there again \u2013 hopefully on the moors \u2013but I think you have to be a bit more proficient than I am.\u201d He commends Rashford but concurs that the game has not always covered itself in glory in recent months. Premier League clubs spent more than \u00a31bn in the transfer window while many teams lower down the pyramid continue to live hand to mouth. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve probably got to do is try to stave off capitulation of football clubs and leagues in particular; I think the time to recalibrate is when it\u2019s all over. But stories like Bury going bust, Macclesfield going bust, don\u2019t sit easy with me. \u201cI know because of my son James and his involvement with Macclesfield, and my involvement in regard of being the Watford head coach and being involved in Premier League meetings, the disconnect and the lack of empathy in terms of connection with what the bigger picture is. There may be more casualties; I\u2019m surprised that there haven\u2019t been more \u2026 It would feel better to live in a world where there was a bit more understanding of what it means for people who are slightly less [well] off.\u201d In March he said he had a \u201clove-hate relationship\u201d with football and asked whether the way things ended at Watford had swung the pendulum more one way than the other, he elaborates on that comment. \u201cI should probably quantify it with \u2018and myself,\u2019 in the sense it is a little bit like that. \u201cHas it pushed it [one way more than the other]? Actually, with a little bit of hindsight and a bit of time, I\u2019ve got a lot of warmth towards the people. I spoke to a couple of staff members last night. We didn\u2019t really talk about the club. We talked about them, families, how they were etc. It wasn\u2019t really about football. It was more about them, contacts, etc. Maybe I\u2019m getting a bit of a softie, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He grins. Pearson is open-minded but, whatever\u2019s next, he will be wholehearted in his approach. \u201cI can\u2019t do things half-measure. I don\u2019t do things half-measure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for me to commit to something. I\u2019ll only really know when either an opportunity comes along or if I feel that grab inside myself. It quite literally could be anything \u2026 apart from mucking the stables out. I\u2019m not doing that!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
