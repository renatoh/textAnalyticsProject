The local government secretary, Stephen Byers, released detailed proposals today to speed up the eviction of nuisance neighbours and force more landlords to take action against anti-social behaviour. Crisis and Shelter, the two best known charities for homeless people, both expressed concern that the plan could lead to more homelessness at a time when the rate of home possession orders taken out of against council and housing association tenants has doubled since 1994. Announcing the plan, Mr Byers said: \"We are not on an eviction crusade, but where eviction is necessary and a proportionate response to anti-social behaviour, it must happen with all possible speed.\" One of the proposals would result in automatic eviction for any one found guilty of serious or persistent nuisance, by making anti-social behaviour a mandatory ground for possession. Such a move would remove the discretion of judges to respond more leniently in individual circumstances. The plans also outline greater use of introductory tenancies or starter tenancies under which, for one year, councils or housing associations can evict unruly residents using their own evidence before taking the case to court. The most draconian option proposes extending introductory tenancy arrangements in the case of anti-social behaviour for all council and housing tenants permanently. Other options include giving landlords the power to extend introductory tenancies indefinitely in selected cases, and allow them to demote individual residents to introductory tenants if they become anti-social. The consultation paper also proposes that all landlords publish details of their anti-social behaviour polices, and it gives advice on how to prevent the problem as well as rehabilitate offenders. The proposals are being considered alongside changes in the police reform bill, to widen the use of anti-social behaviour orders or curfews against nuisance neighbours. Mr Byers said: \"None of us should underestimate the sheer misery and disruption anti-social behaviour can wreak across neighbourhoods and the wider community.\" A Crisis spokesman said: \"A lot of people who have serious mental health problems could be interpreted as nuisance neighbours, it's those people that we are really worried about. They should be helped in their homes rather than evicted, which usually results in a sharp decline in their mental health.\" He pointed out that 12.6% of the rough sleepers helped by Crisis last year in shelters or day centres had been made homelessness by eviction. \"We are concerned that the paper is much more heavily focused on enforcement and the powers of landlords than rehabilitation or prevention,\" he added. A spokesman for Shelter said: \"Eviction does not end anti-social behaviour but simply moves the problem on. Any measure used against someone accused of anti-social behaviour must be backed up with help to reintegrate them into the community they live in.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
