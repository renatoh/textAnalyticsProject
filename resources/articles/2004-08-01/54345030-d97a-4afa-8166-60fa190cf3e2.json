Giorgos Chrisostomides, 24, was on a life-support machine with injuries to his head and back after jumping from their apartment. Eleni Ioannou, 20, is also in a critical condition after falling from the balcony on Saturday following an argument with Chrisostomides. Police are investigating how Ioannou fell. They had questioned Chrisostomides but released him. Neighbours reported hearing Chrisostomides, an unemployed car mechanic, shout \"I'm going to find Eleni\" before he attempted to jump on Sunday - an effort that was thwarted by relatives and friends. Ioannou's fall at the weekend cast a shadow over the Greek Olympic team, of which she was a member. Her replacement, Eleni Patsiou, said: \"Under different conditions I would be full of joy, but not at the moment because Eleni is my friend and I know that her condition is critical.\" And Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, head of the Greek Olympic team, added: \"This is turning into a big tragedy.\" Ioannou, a student at the Athens Gymnastics Academy, was a promising Olympian in a sport that only recently gained popularity in Greece. With only four years of experience, she had won three national championships, and a bronze medal in the Balkan championships. Meanwhile, Friday's opening ceremony will find the Olympic stadium turned into a lake where mythological figures will sail through the water and a giant statue of the goddess Athena will rise up. The closing ceremony will focus on Greek traditions with dancing and celebrations of Greek life, including a wedding. Organisers will today carry out a full dress rehearsal with about 70,000 spectators in attendance to test security, crowd management and transport issues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
