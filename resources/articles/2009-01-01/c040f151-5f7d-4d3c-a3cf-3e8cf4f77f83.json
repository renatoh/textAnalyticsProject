After the election, the change of mood in the normally subdued Jordanian capital was palpable. Everybody wanted to talk about Obama, and, with Tzipi Livni still a largely unknown figure here, there was genuine hope among many that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process would finally make the progress the Bush-Blair era made much noise about but never delivered. The sense of goodwill toward Obama also stemmed from optimism that, after eight disastrous years of Bush-Cheney foreign policy, Iraq might finally begin to heal and Guantanamo Bay might finally be closed. Troops out of Iraq means much to the estimated 500,000 Iraqis currently living in refugee camps in Jordan, many with little access to housing and education. Every conversation operated on the same three points: Obama, Iraq and hope. Today, however, the mood couldn't be more different, and the word that most often follows Obama's name in conversation is not \"Iraq\" but \"Gaza\". \"Hope\" is probably the last idea that would accompany it. The aerial bombardment and later ground invasion of the Gaza Strip over the last three weeks has changed everything, and few people here watched the build-up to the inauguration. While CNN is spending 48 hours in ceaseless coverage of events in Washington, reporting the great narrative of American political change, the focus of Arab news networks and of people in the Middle East is still largely on Gaza \u2013 the dead and the tens of thousands now homeless. Every Middle Easterner knows who Livni is now, and Obama is now often currently seen as the good man who did nothing \u2013 who, his difficult position during the transition period acknowledged, nonetheless frustrated many by barely speaking out while some 1,300 Gazans were killed by one of America's closest allies. Around half of Jordan's population is of recent Palestinian descent, and Gaza is less than 100 miles from Amman. But the geographic proximity felt increasingly like a bad joke or a mind trick, as the already-blockaded Strip became increasingly sealed under siege, and Jordanian-Palestinians were left unable to contact their families and friends on the other side of Israel. Obama encouraged Americans to spend this year's Martin Luther King day volunteering for their communities. Over the past three weeks here, Jordanians, Palestinians and others bought food and medical supplies and organised dozens of fundraisers for international charities working in Gaza. The Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation was overwhelmed by donations from ordinary people of canned food and medical supplies for UNRWA aid convoys, an initiative which suffered a setback on January 8 when UNRWA seemed about to leave Gaza when the its aid convoy was hit. Al Jazeera, the only television news network with a presence in Gaza during the military offensive, provided a constant (and eventually, perhaps, unhelpful) stream of graphic images of the dead and wounded civilians in Gaza. American networks seemed content to represent the feeling of the region solely through reporting Muslim Brotherhood-backed protests in the Middle East, replete with iconic stereotypes of flag-burning and violent threats \u2013 and there's no denying that the Gaza attack brought every odious, antisemitic Islamist spokesperson out of the woodwork. But many more ordinary Jordanians, Syrians and Lebanese participated in far-less-newsworthy efforts such as blood drives to help the injured in Gaza. With the tentative ceasefire now in place, Gaza, like many other tragedies, will go back to its low-level, un-newsworthy state of humanitarian crisis, and there will be little hope, or change, in this part of the world in the coming weeks. This is not to say Obama has become an unpopular figure here. If asked about him, most people still mention his speech facing the ruins of the Umayyad Palace in Amman last summer, and the fact that he has signalled a willingness, at least, to talk to all heads-of-state in order to repair international ties damaged by the Bush administration. But for the last three weeks here, you'd have to mention his name for people to talk about him. The great story of America's chance for change in Obama isn't the narrative that dominates the days here. Obama's inauguration is historic and contains, at least, the hope for change. Unlike most American stories pushing humanitarian tragedies off the front page, Obama deserves to dominate the world's news today. From here, the start of Obama's presidency is the start of one dream fulfilled. But the dream of a just peace between Israel and the Palestinians is still denied. It still festers. A hundred miles away from Gaza, it feels as though so much has happened since the optimism of November's election night that, while most here still wish Obama well, there is little to hope for or celebrate. In his inauguration speech, Obama claimed to \"seek a new way forward\" with the Muslim world, and that \"those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west \u2013 know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy\". Obama still represents a better chance than his predecessors for something lasting and just to be built in the Middle East, but it is far from being fulfilled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
