Despite having no prior interest in (or knowledge of) F1, I found Senna both informative and engaging \u2013 a riveting portrait of a man whose high-speed achievements had previously meant nothing to me. For his latest work, Kapadia has once again focused on a sport in which I have no emotional investment \u2013 football. Yet watching this typically punchy portrait of Argentina\u2019s most infamous sporting son, I found myself gripped by a universally accessible tale of a divided soul \u2013 a figure whose dual personas are embodied in the two names of the film\u2019s title; Diego and Maradona. Kapadia opens his film in breathless, bravura style \u2013 a frenetic car-chase through the crowded streets of Naples (The Italian Job meets The French Connection), which snappily gets us up to speed with Maradona\u2019s shooting-star career prior to his big-bucks transfer to Napoli in 1984. A head-spinning montage of sights (excruciating ankle injuries) and sounds (Pel\u00e9 declaring that his spiritual successor \u201cisn\u2019t psychologically prepared yet\u201d) plunge us into the melee of an overcrowded press conference, where this underdog city unveils its most expensive signing. \u201cI would like to know,\u201d says the French journalist who gets in the first question, \u2018if Maradona knows what the Camorra is\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a provocative gambit, and the young footballer, caught in the glare of the cameras and flashbulbs, looks baffled. It also perfectly sets out Kapadia\u2019s stall; a tale of rags and riches, saints and sinners, crime and football, injury and victory, all played out against the backdrop of the city that comes to embody his divided spirit. Trainer Fernando Signorini provides the key that unlocks this duality. It is Signorini who identifies the split between the shy, loving \u201cmomma\u2019s boy\u201d from the slums whom he would follow to the ends of the Earth; and the rather more monstrous third-person creation who would become the focus of such intense public scrutiny. Throughout all of the high-profile triumphs and scandals that ensue (drug busts, disqualifications, affairs, contested offspring etc), Kapadia keeps this dynamic tension to the fore, reminding us of Maradona\u2019s roots, juxtaposing the extravagant lifestyle that made him headline news with the hard-knocks reality of his background. Having grown up in the poverty of Villa Fiorito, south of central Buenos Aires, sporting prodigy Diego effectively provided for his family from the age of 15. No wonder he found himself at home in Naples, whose football fans would regularly face taunting chants calling upon Vesuvius to \u201cwash them with fire\u201d. And no wonder Naples didn\u2019t want to let him go when Maradona signalled his desire to step away from their spotlight. As always, Kapadia is particularly good at positioning key events within a wider cultural context. He sets up Argentina\u2019s infamous \u201chand of God\u201d victory against England as payback for the Falklands war, with Maradona gloating that \u201cthe linesman didn\u2019t see!\u201d He describes how a prominent crime family used Maradona\u2019s growing cocaine addiction and fondness for Rolex watches to co-opt his brand name for their own purposes. Most astutely, he unpicks the cultural significance of the 1990 World Cup semi-final in which Maradona played for Argentina against Italy in the charged environment of the San Paolo stadium. \u201cNaples is not Italy,\u201d Maradona rashly declared, believing that his adopted home town would somehow side with him against their national team. With bravissimo dramatic flair, Kapadia manages to bring the entire weight of his narrative to focus upon a pivotal penalty kick \u2013 the point at which all the warring elements of this powerful film intersect. Like the Oscar-winning Amy, Diego Maradona serves on one level as a cautionary tale about the dark side of celebrity. We hear how a phial of Maradona\u2019s blood somehow found its way into a church \u2013 a latter-day holy relic. And we are shown that thin line between adoration and abjection that anyone who lives their life in public must walk, with Maradona turning from god to devil almost in an instant. As before, archive footage is the key, with Kapadia and editor Chris King trawling through hundreds of hours of material to find the images (many previously unseen) in which their truth lurks. Sound design is crucial too, with City of God composer Antonio Pinto\u2019s evocative score jostling with an assortment of kicks, slaps and punches that accompany the unfolding action, keeping things urgent without ever losing track of the story\u2019s human pulse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
