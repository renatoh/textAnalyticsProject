Women\u2019s sports mistake thinness for fitness When Mary Cain got the call from Nike it was a dream come true. It was 2013 and the teenage track star was the fastest girl in America. Being asked to join the Nike Oregon Project, a prestigious running program led by famed track coach Alberto Salazar, seemed like the next step to world domination. But Cain\u2019s immense talent wasn\u2019t nurtured in Oregon \u2013 it was starved. In a heartbreaking video op-ed for the New York Times, Cain, now 23, describes how the \u201call-male Nike staff became convinced that in order for me to get better, I had to become thinner, and thinner, and thinner.\u201d Salazar would publicly shame Cain about her weight and tell her she was too large. In response Cain started to obsess over her weight. As her body fat plummeted so did her estrogen levels. She didn\u2019t get her period for three years and she broke five bones. (Low estrogen affects bone density.) She became depressed and started cutting herself. Eventually she left the Oregon project. The project itself, by the way, was shut down a month ago after Salazar was embroiled in a doping scandal. Cain\u2019s story is horrific but, unfortunately, it\u2019s not unusual. As the Times notes in an article accompanying the op-ed, the pressure to lose dangerous amounts of body fat also \u201caffected the only other female athlete featured in the last Nike video ad Cain appeared in, the figure skater Gracie Gold \u2026 [L]ike Cain, Gold got caught in a system where she was compelled to become thinner and thinner. Gold developed disordered eating to the point of imagining taking her life.\u201d Nike has said it will be investigating Cain\u2019s claims of abuse at the Oregon project but this is far too little, too late. It can\u2019t be emphasized enough that what happened to Cain isn\u2019t the result of a few toxic coaches, it\u2019s a systemic issue in women\u2019s sports. Women are treated like they\u2019re simply smaller men, and forced to conform to standards designed around male bodies. \u201cI got caught in a system designed by and for men, which destroys the bodies of young girls,\u201d Cain says in the video. \u201c[T]here is a systemic crisis in women\u2019s sports and at Nike, in which young girls\u2019 bodies are being ruined.\u201d Cain said. So how do we change this? Well, as Cain notes in her video, \u201cWe need more women in power \u2013 part of me wonders if I\u2019d worked with more female psychologists, coaches and nutritionists, where I\u2019d be today.\u201d I also think we should levy a BS tax on companies that love to talk about female empowerment, but aren\u2019t so keen on doing something about it. Earlier this year, for example, Nike spent a fortune on a flashy female-focused ad campaign called \u201cDream Crazier\u201d, featuring the likes of Serena Williams. Until recently, however, it cut compensation during maternity leave. The company is also facing a federal lawsuit alleging it violated equal pay laws. So enough with the expensive ads, Nike. If you really want to empower women maybe start by ensuring that no other young athlete has to suffer what Cain went through. Australia\u2019s top female footballers get equal pay Some good sports news: Australia\u2019s top women\u2019s team (the Matildas) will now get an equal share of player-generated revenue as the men\u2019s team (the Socceroos). The Matildas will also get a better parental leave policy and will get to travel business on international flights. In the past the Socceroos \u2013 a fairly useless team \u2013 got to fly business while women had to go economy. What\u2019s the collective noun for a group of white men? A \u201cpodcast\u201d. An analysis of the most popular podcasts on UK iTunes by Quartz found that, of 480 top podcast hosts, only one in three were women. Just over one in 10 were non-white. LGBTQ diversity on TV hits all-time high The percentage of LGBTQ characters on prime-time broadcast TV has reached an all-time high of 10.2%, according to a study released by advocacy group Glaad. Last year the figure was 8.8% The Irishman\u2019s silent women The most important female figure in Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman has about 10 minutes of screen time in a movie that is 3.5 hours long. She speaks exactly six words. Japanese women fight for right to wear glasses at work Yep, you read that right. Incredible as it may seem, it would appear that some Japanese employers are banning women from wearing glasses. The hashtag \u201cglasses are forbidden\u201d started trending on Twitter after a Japanese TV show exposed businesses implementing the glasses ban. Keanu Reeves has an age-appropriate girlfriend She\u2019s called Alexandra Grant and she\u2019s 46 \u2013 Keanu is 55. Listen I love Keanu just like everyone else, but the fact that people are gushing over a male celebrity dating a woman above the age of 30 says a hell of a lot about how warped our culture is. Jeff Goldblum rushes to Woody Allen\u2019s defence \u201cI feel like this cultural shift [the #MeToo movement] is very, very positive and long overdue and I support it wholeheartedly,\u201d Goldblum said in an interview with iNews. But, he continued, he really likes Woody Allen and \u201cwould consider working with him, until I learned something more\u201d. As one wag tweeted: \u201cSadly Jeff Goldblum has left the Holy Trinity. Paul Rudd has ascended, joining Tom Hanks and Keanu Reeves.\u201d That\u2019s not a hymen, it\u2019s a social construct Rapper TI has revealed that he gets his daughter\u2019s hymen checked annually to check if she\u2019s a virgin. Which is, to put it mildly, incredibly disturbing. It\u2019s also nonsensical. As Planned Parenthood tweeted: \u201cIdk who needs to hear this but virginity is a made-up social construct, and it has absolutely nothing to do with your hymen \u2026 Some people think you can tell if someone\u2019s had sex before if their hymen is stretched open. But that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Writing for the Guardian, Jill Filipovic also notes that \u201cthe entire concept of virginity is misogynistic\u201d. While the TI story is alarming it has, at least, spawned an important conversation around virginity testing. It has also spawned a highly amusing \u201cThat\u2019s not a hymen\u201d Twitter meme.
