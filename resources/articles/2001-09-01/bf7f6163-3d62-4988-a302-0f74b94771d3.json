Then again David Beckham did stress the importance of being patient. Hope and Munich were also on the agenda in 1938, Neville Chamberlain having just returned from Bavaria with his famous piece of paper. The white sheets of paper last night were those showing an England team without any changes from last Saturday. No surprises there, but the millions tuning in across the land will have been a little startled at the number of empty seats at St James' Park staring back at them. It is an image that will have distressed not only those at the Football Association but every Geordie worth his bottle of broon. This was a party that lacked the atmosphere expected. The leader of the Geordie tribe, Bobby Robson, will have been as embarrassed as anyone by that. At Newcastle they reckon they could sell out the re-laying of the pitch - over 110,000 turned up for their three InterToto Cup home games. Not that this was Newcastle's responsibility. Every ticket for last night was sold, but clearly a few thousand of them will be landing on doormats this morning. Magic organisation. Those absent missed a touching ovation for Robson, the FA's special guest. But as he walked along the line shaking the hands of the England team, the Newcastle United manager may well have been thinking \"Manchester United, Arsenal, Leeds United, Liverpool - but none of my boys.\" As the Albanians frustrated England, Robson was probably thinking about how cheap they would be to buy. Not that the Albanians looked cheap in that impressive first half. The last England opposition here had been rather more accommodating. Norway were the visitors in that November of 1938. A crowd of just under 40,000 saw an England side featuring the talents of Stan Cullis, Tommy Lawton and Stanley Matthews win 4-0. There is no record of how many got their tickets the following morning. After that England played five more internationals, beating Ireland, as it was then, 7-0 the following weekend at Old Trafford. But after the war Wembley became the home of English football and it was not until its mooted demolition and replacement that places like Newcastle and Derby could even contemplate staging England matches again. Now that there is still so little movement on the national stadium front regional grounds like this will perk up. Birmingham council advertised their suitability on a huge England flag draped outside St James'. Maybe they know something: the national stadium question is due to be formally addressed within the month. St James' could be waiting another 63 years. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
