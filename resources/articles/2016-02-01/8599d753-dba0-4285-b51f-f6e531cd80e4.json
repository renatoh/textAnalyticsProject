The prime minister has been warned by Whitehall figures that he has to do more to convince leaders in eastern Europe, as negotiations on Britain\u2019s future in Europe enter their final stages with the publication of proposals by the European council president Donald Tusk for a \u201cnew settlement\u201d. Beata Maria Szyd\u0142o, the Polish prime minister, told Cameron in Warsaw late last year that Poland and the other three members of the Visegr\u00e1d group \u2013 Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia \u2013 are opposed to any changes that will discriminate against their citizens working in the UK. Downing Street was encouraged when Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, agreed at a meeting in Brussels on Friday that an emergency brake to limit benefit payments to EU migrants for four years could be imposed as soon as a referendum is passed. However, the proposal is causing concern among east European leaders, who fear a backlash among their citizens in the UK who still have the right to vote in domestic elections. \u201cThe prime minister will be focusing quite heavily on the Visegr\u00e1d group over the next two weeks,\u201d one Whitehall source. \u201cIt is clear that there are nerves about how Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and workers from the Baltic States working in the UK might vote in elections back home.\u201d Senior British sources said they are encouraged by the progress in the prime minister\u2019s negotiations which intensified over the weekend with the Juncker meeting on Friday and a dinner with Tusk in No 10 on Sunday night. Tusk tweeted on Monday night that he had made good progress with British and other officials since meeting Cameron in Downing Street on Sunday night, though he said there are still outstanding areas. Cameron is expected to brief the cabinet on Tuesday morning on the state of his negotiations with Tusk, who hopes to reach a deal at the next European council meeting on 18-19 February. A failure to reach agreement could lead Tusk to convene a second, extra, summit by the first week of March to allow Cameron to hold an in/out referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership on his preferred date of 23 June. One UK source said: \u201cThings seem to be moving in the right direction. But there\u2019s many a slip \u2018twixt the cup and the lip.\u201d The prime minister will give a detailed response to Tusk\u2019s statement on Tuesday, which is likely to be highly detailed and will explain any legislative changes that are needed. No 10 sought to highlight progress by saying that the prime minister has secured agreement on one of his demands set out in the Conservative general election manifesto \u2013 a red card system that will allow a group of national parliaments to club together to block EU legislation. Under Tusk\u2019s draft agreement, 55% of the EU\u2019s national parliaments could force the European council to stop or amend legislation they believe is unnecessary. A No 10 source said: \u201cThis will strengthen the power of Westminster to stop unnecessary EU laws and addresses concerns that the current yellow card system has not proved strong enough. It ensures that the European commission cannot just ignore the will of national parliamentarians and delivers greater democratic control over what the EU does.\u201d The red card system has been relatively uncontroversial in the negotiations. The more difficult areas have been the prime minister\u2019s plan to ban EU migrants from claiming in-work benefits for four years. Downing Street says the emergency brake would have to be as effective as the prime minister\u2019s original proposal of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits. No 10 indicated that more work was needed on Osborne\u2019s demands for non-eurozone countries to be given protections from rules drawn up for the single market. Downing Street said the UK was looking for a watertight \u201cenforcement mechanism\u201d, though not a veto, to allow non-eurozone members to flag up concerns. This could involve contentious legislation being referred to EU leaders on the European council. France is nervous because no member state has a veto over the rules of the single market, while each EU leader has a veto on the European council. More work was also needed to stop non-EU citizens getting access to Britain through \u201csham marriages\u201d. Non-EU citizens who marry a UK citizen have no automatic right to settle in the UK. But if they marry a citizen of another EU country they can move to the UK under the EU\u2019s rules on free movement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
