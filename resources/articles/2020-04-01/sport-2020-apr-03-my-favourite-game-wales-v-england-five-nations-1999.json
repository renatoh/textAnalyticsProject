With Cardiff\u2019s sporting Asgard being rebuilt, the ageing London edifice teems with scarlet-clad fanatics determined to see English noses rubbed in their own hallowed turf. Tom Jones leads the choir with a lusty Bread of Heaven, stood alongside that cheeky bard of the valleys Max Boyce. Clear London skies cast long shadows in the April afternoon. The feeling shared among the Welsh is that something is afoot, that Graham Henry\u2019s men could poop the party and deny England a grand slam at the site of their footballing brethren\u2019s greatest sporting triumph, 1966 and all that. How wonderful that would be. But, quietly, there are doubts, for Clive Woodward\u2019s formidable England bristle with intent, marshalled by Lawrence Dallaglio, flanked by a youthful Martin Johnson and a baby-faced 19-year-old Jonny Wilkinson. Just to confirm Welsh fears England make a thunderous start, Matt Perry flashing from inside his own half, a quick pass to Dan Luger and over the line he speeds. Wales agog. Young Jonny converts and the Wembley scoreboard reads 0-7. But England have a flaw. Almost from the restart they concede a penalty and Neil Jenkins slots the kick. Wales\u2019s metronome will keep his side hammering at the door every time the English put daylight on the scoreboard. It\u2019s breathless as penalties are traded and, after 19 minutes, England are a point in front. They press hard and another of their teenagers, Steve Hanley, charges over to touch down on his debut. But, hold on, Wilkinson fluffs the conversion. 15-9 to England but will that uncharacteristic miss prove costly? Wales, undeterred, regather and bullocking through England ranks comes Craig \u201cMad Hippo\u201d Quinnell. Jenkins strikes a beauty from the right touchline, his fourth. Then a fifth from almost the middle of the pitch, and on the half-hour Wales are level. Wilkinson answers that with an uprights-splitting arrow of his own and England make a bold statement before half-time. Matt Dawson kicks ahead and two Welsh defenders, transfixed by the ball\u2019s arc, collide. Richard Hill claims the ball and slides over. Wilkinson converts and England are 10 points up. There\u2019s still time for another penalty as Jenkins keeps his cool and Wales in contention. From the restart \u2013 at last \u2013 a score for Wales to cheer. Again it\u2019s Jenkins at the fulcrum, lobbing a long pass out to his right and Shane Howarth crosses. The Ponty No10 converts: 25-all, just three minutes into the second half. England, affronted, surge back, claiming a penalty under the posts that Jonny slots \u2026 anything Jenks can do is the message. Then another and all the game\u2019s protocols are forgotten as his kick is roundly booed. Still, it\u2019s now 25-31 but as this Wembley thriller edges to 80 minutes the cold reality is all too clear to the Welsh: the steadfast black boot of Jenkins alone will not be sufficient to win this match. Wales are punished for dangerous play and England, scenting blood, kick to touch. The ball moves inside and Mike Catt lobs a high one towards the Welsh posts. Claim it and they must score \u2013 hard luck, boyos, but the title is England\u2019s. But it is red 13, Mark Taylor, who grasps the ball and turns away, the game slipping into injury time. Wales\u2019s redeemer arrives. Scott Gibbs is in full flight when the other Scott, the punk-haired Quinnell, sells England\u2019s defenders with a sleight of hand gleaned from rugby league and Gibbs, sidestepping, floating, motors through the gap, showboating for a heart-stopping moment, and touches down. One point in it, and here cometh Jenkins. A flutter of his hand and a swing of that redoubtable boot \u2013 the conversion is sweet perfection: 32-31. Victory belongs to Wales, to Gibbs and Jenkins and the travelling hoards, revelling in a first defeat of the old enemy since 1993."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
