But, after he talked his way back into Ian Holloway's side for Queens Park Rangers' trip, this was probably not the return he was dreaming of. His 73rd-minute red card, for kicking out at Steve Sidwell after being fooled into leaving a ball to his opponent, at least prompted the home fans to sing his name once more but it had Holloway hitting slightly higher notes. \"I was screaming and shouting,\" he said. \"Jamie apologised and I wasn't having it. I put him back in the team on an emotional day for him and he does that. It was selfish and unprofessional.\" Holloway refused to condemn Sidwell's gamesmanship and the Reading captain insisted it was nothing new on the football pitch. \"It happens all the time,\" he said. \"I regret it because of the outcome for Jamie but I don't because we got the three points and that's all that matters. I don't want it to detract from how hard we worked and our performance.\" \"Performance\" speaks too highly of a poor first half for both sides. The most entertaining moment came while the teams were still in the dressing rooms: Santa arrived on a zipline to deliver the match ball as his helper got stuck inelegantly halfway down. \"It was like a derby,\" said Reading's manager Steve Coppell. \"It was agitated, very frenetic, the closing down was committed. To get three points from a game like that was very pleasing, without it being a pleasing spectacle.\" Reading's Dave Kitson, injured just before the hour by an awkward landing, and Rangers' similarly prolific frontman Paul Furlong were kept quiet, a diving header straight at Marcus Hahnemann the latter's only real chance before half-time. QPR looked to be on the up but a Reading free-kick, effortlessly stroked into the top corner by Nicky Shorey, was to prove their undoing. Reduced to 10 men shortly afterwards, Holloway's team struggled to fight back. There was doubt over Shorey's intent on striking the free-kick but Coppell was not examining a goal that kept Reading five points ahead of fifth-placed Sheffield United. They remain unbeaten at home since April. Man of the match: Nicky Shorey (Reading)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
