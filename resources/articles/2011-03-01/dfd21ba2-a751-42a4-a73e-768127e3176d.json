Dahl's SXSW opener compared clean writing, primarily that of George Orwell, beautiful composition \u2013 the \"stripped-down minimalism\" of the Clash \u2013 and good programming. Orwell's six famous rules for clear writing, he argued, should be rules of thumb for every coder in the land. Although Dahl couldn't name the finest programming he'd ever seen \u2013 could you, on the spot? how about your favourite book? or song? \u2013 his point was that unnecessary strands of writing ultimately makes everything more complex. \"If we consume good writing in other mediums, poetry and good composition of music, that will lead to better programming. \"Programming is writing. It's taking abstract thoughts and putting them into practice, like a poet or an essayist,\" he said. The evolution of classical music, meanwhile, shows how simplicity and complexity move in an equilibrium over time. And, like programmers, classical composers \"work in an environment entirely unrelated to their end product\". Johann Sebastian Bach, writing in a complex Baroque style, then along comes another composer who \"throws it away\" and you get the more simple, classical structure, with Mozart. Then Beethoven builds on this with bigger, more complex work. Then Brahms, Mahler and others follow. \"It's the composers \u2013 the programmers \u2013 who navigate this cycle of simplicity and complexity well who create beauty,\" Dahl opined. \"The core of good programming style is minimalism, expressing really complex ideas in a simple, minimal style. Clear direct writing also enables clearer thinking about what's being written.\" And like the novelist may spend month \u2013 years, even \u2013 revising their purple prose until it's fit for the shelves, programmers should always clean up their code. How do you justify constantly revising your code to your investors and VPs, someone asks? \"That's simple: Don't tell them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
