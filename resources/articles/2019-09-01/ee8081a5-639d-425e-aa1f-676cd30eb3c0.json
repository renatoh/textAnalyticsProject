The Brave Blossoms\u2019 stunning 19-12 win over a side that ranked world number one just a few weeks ago has electrified the Rugby World Cup, with international stars quick to pay tribute on social media. \u201cWhat have we just witnessed?\u201d the former Welsh wing Shane Williams asked on Twitter. \u201cOne of the performances of the tournament so far!\u201d The England legend Jason Robinson declared: \u201cThey\u2019ve only gone and done it again!!!! Huge well done to @JRFURugby.\u201d In Tokyo, as the final whistle blew some 180km away in Shizuoka, fans drank in the magnitude of their team\u2019s performance, a victory that eclipsed the defeat of Fiji by unfancied Uruguay on Wednesday, another shock result that the game\u2019s supporters hope will attract new converts. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we stood any chance of winning before the match,\u201d said Kazuyuki Imano, an IT worker who played rugby at high school. \u201cBut we\u2019ve won. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Those who recalled the \u201cBrighton miracle\u201d, Japan\u2019s epic victory over South Africa in the last Rugby World Cup, said this weekend\u2019s \u201cShizuoka shock\u201d surpassed even the heroics of four years ago. Several predicted that the game would reap dividends in Japan, if the team were able to build on their historic victory. \u201cThis is much bigger,\u201d said Takuya Sato, a longtime rugby fan who faced Japan\u2019s winger Kotaro Matsushima as a high school player. \u201cOnce the tournament is over, rugby fever might subside a bit. But if Japan reach the quarter-finals, it will be a huge boost for the sport here.\u201d TV networks flashed the result, while, in bars around Japan\u2019s capital, seasoned rugby fans and recent converts exchanged high fives and hugs, with some cheekily ordering rounds of Guinness to celebrate. Social media sites were overrun with video clips of the match, with some voicing mixed feelings about the result. Oona McGee, a half-Japanese Australian who lives in Tokyo, tweeted: \u201cJoy and sorrow but what a match! Brilliant play by Japan.\u201d The tournament\u2019s official Japan-language account posted a clip of prop Keita Inagaki in tears after the final whistle. Japan failed to reach the knockout stages of the last world cup, despite winning three of their four pool games. But victory over Ireland leaves them within reach of the quarter-finals, with Samoa and Scotland standing in their way. \u201cJapan won because they did the obvious things really well \u2013 they just kept running at Ireland right until the end,\u201d said Masaaki Yamashika, who watched the match, appropriately enough, at Craic, an Irish-themed pub. \u201cI think Ireland thought they were going to win this and let their concentration go.\u201d Qualifying from Pool A would, though, raise the possibility of a quarter-final meeting between Japan and the All Blacks \u2013 a prospect many home fans wanted to avoid. \u201cWe\u2019d much rather play South Africa and repeat what we did to them four years ago,\u201d said Naoto Kamikubo in between gulps of beer on a warm evening in Tokyo. His friend Hidenari Shiromizu said the drama in Shizuoka had truly brought the competition to life for home supporters, just over a week after an error-prone Japan beat Russia in the tournament\u2019s opening fixture. \u201cI was three years old when the first Rugby World Cup was held,\u201d Shiromizu said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s here \u2026 and this has happened.\u201d Most pundits expected Ireland to prevail over Japan, but Japan\u2019s coach, Jamie Joseph, said his side had gone into the match with only victory in mind. \u201cWe\u2019re ecstatic about the result,\u201d the New Zealander said. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the players, we had a plan. We\u2019ve been training for a long time. We\u2019ve been thinking about this game for quite a long time. Obviously, Ireland have been thinking about it for the last six or seven days.\u201d The Ireland hooker Rory Best, paid tribute to the host nation. \u201cWe knew how tough it was going to be. Anyone who is utterly shocked hasn\u2019t seen how good they were. We had a game plan and were prepared, we made a few mistakes and were on the wrong side of the penalty count. But Japan played really well and posed us a lot of questions, unfortunately we couldn\u2019t come up with the right answers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
