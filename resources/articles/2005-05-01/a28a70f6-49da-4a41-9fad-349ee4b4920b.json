The Spaniard, dismayed by his side's inconsistencies in the Premiership in his first year in charge, remains convinced victory against Milan in Istanbul next Wednesday could prove the prelude to a long-term resurgence at Anfield. Anything approaching the success Ben\u00edtez enjoyed in Spain, where his Valencia side broke the duopoly of Real Madrid and Barcelona, would see the manager elevated alongside the great Liverpool coaches, given that the Anfield club have failed to win a league title in 15 years. \"People only think about Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United winning the big trophies but it was the same in Spain with Real Madrid and Barcelona and we managed to win two titles with Valencia,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"I know it will be difficult to do the same in England, but I am confident we will. I will try to do the same as Bill Shankly and build a successful club, despite what the other clubs have in terms of money. We just have to work hard and believe. \"I want to be at this club for many years and to win a lot of trophies. I am confident we can achieve that. If people talk about me in the future like Shankly and Paisley then that is fantastic, but I need a lot more time to achieve what those two managers achieved.\" Earlier in the season he had said: \"Shankly changed Liverpool's mentality into the hungry one that fuelled their desire to win. That was the basis of the teams that later, even without him, won those four European Cups.\" He is already shaping the club's immediate future by targeting potential summer recruits, such as Jos\u00e9 Reina of Villarreal and Real Zaragoza's Gabriel Milito, as well as the Portsmouth midfielder Gary O'Neil, although the initial suggestion of a swap deal for the out-of-favour duo Salif Diao and Bruno Cheyrou has been rejected by the south coast club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
