Who was it for? What did it offer an audience supposedly getting most of their TV viewing from streaming and online sites? Hadn\u2019t we been here before with Waterloo Road? More fool the naysayers, because the third series of Ackley, as its fans affectionately know it, begins on Tuesday and it does so as one of Channel 4\u2019s most popular dramas. What\u2019s more, the show, which follows the merger of two Yorkshire schools \u2013 one predominately white, the other mostly Asian \u2013 has amassed a devoted young audience that has continued to grow with each season. Channel 4\u2019s figures suggest that 32% of its viewers are aged between 16 and 34, the channel\u2019s highest youth skewing drama since 2015\u2019s This Is England 90. Meanwhile, a robust online presence includes Tumblr sites devoted to various different characters, eager Twitter feeds counting down the days until the show\u2019s return and a savvy social media presence that utilises everything from Instagram to Snapchat. \u201cThe enormous response from younger viewers did really take me by surprise,\u201d says series creator Ayub Khan-Din, best-known for the film East Is East. \u201cI think every school show that\u2019s gone before \u2013 Grange Hill, Waterloo Road \u2013 they\u2019ve all had something to say to the generation that\u2019s watched them, but the thing with this generation is that they\u2019re very tech savvy and so the way in which they communicate their feelings about the show is so different. Of course, it means we have millions of critics, who know the show backwards and let us know instantly if they don\u2019t like something, but I think that\u2019s what makes it exciting.\u201d Channel 4 commissioning editor Manpreet Dosanjh agrees. \u201cWhen the trailer for the third series was released we instantly had superfans breaking it down, creating memes, \u201d she says. \u201cOne of the big reasons that Ackley works is that we hit a sweet spot between outrageous conversations and memorable characters who have viewers going: \u2018I love those characters, they\u2019re like me.\u2019\u201d Penny Woolcock, who has directed a number of episodes, including its pilot, was keen to ensure that Ackley Bridge remained rooted in its Yorkshire community. Roles from extras to speaking parts have all been filled by local pupils, many of whom had never considered a career in acting before, and Woolcock stress the importance of ensuring that the show truly gives back to Halifax and its surrounding regions. \u201cWe\u2019ve had kids who\u2019ve had roles on the show and then go on to apply to college, kids who\u2019ve learnt about the wider aspects of filming about the art departments and the costume department and the technical side,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of them are now writing and making their own movies. One of the boys told me: \u2018I\u2019d be prison if it hadn\u2019t been for this show.\u2019\u201d It helps too that the enthusiastic young cast bring an energy of their own, presenting a portrayal of British Asians that is far from the lazy stereotypes of much TV. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely hilarious,\u201d Woolcock says. \u201cReally quick witted and sharp. I think our viewers, particularly the younger ones, respond to that because, for example, too often you only see young Asian men on TV playing terrorists or paedophiles or involved in a plot about honour killing.\u201d Alex Lamb, the series producer, agrees. \u201cWhen we were initially casting for the series we went to the PE departments and asked them for the cockiest football and rugby players they had,\u201d he says. \u201cHalifax and Bradford are full of alpha lads who never thought they could play that sort of role on TV and the show has really opened doors to them and to viewers at home.\u201d Similarly, a character such as glamorous mean girl Alya challenges audiences to see beyond the hijab, says Khan-Din. \u201cI think that\u2019s really great for people to see that these girls are bolshy and opinionated because it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve seen on TV before.\u201d It\u2019s not just the teenage cast who have helped the creators to see things with fresh eyes. \u201cI remember there was one scene where we talking to an older Asian lady about what music her character would listen to and we were doing that stereotypical thing of assuming bhangra,\u201d says Lamb. \u201cShe looked at us a bit scornfully and said: \u2018No I like listening to Elton John and Kylie,\u2019 which really made us realise that we just had to throw those stereotypes out of the window.\u201d What really got the show traction among its young audiences, however, was its refusal to pull its punches when tackling tensions within the two teenaged Muslim and white communities. \u201cWe have to be true to ourselves and expose the darker side of living in this community as well as we can within the 8pm slot,\u201d says Khan-Din. \u201cThis is the story about the amalgamation of a white school with an Asian school and you can\u2019t avoid the politics of that, it\u2019s always there bubbling under.\u201d The show is particularly adept at balancing those darker moments with a lovely lightness of tone, occasionally breaking out a musical interlude and tackling its teenage love stories with sensitivity and heart, most notably Muslim Nas\u2019s tenderly handled coming out. \u201cI\u2019ve had some truly beautiful responses from girls who are going through the same thing that Nas has,\u201d says Amy Lee Hickman, who plays her. \u201cPeople have come up to me on the street and said that watching her coming-out story gave them the push to tell their parents or people close to them the truth about their sexuality. I think that\u2019s one of the most incredible things about Ackley Bridge \u2013 it tells stories that young people can relate to that haven\u2019t been celebrated on TV in this way before and gives a lot of different communities a voice.\u201d As for the show\u2019s continued success both with younger audiences, Dosanjh thinks it boils down to one simple point. \u201cIt\u2019s all too easy to think that teenagers have a short attention or only love glossy and superficial shows, but that\u2019s a very redundant way of thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cAckley shows that if you offer viewers a good emotional story that reflects their lives without soft-soaping them then they will become immersed.\u201d Ackley Bridge returns to Channel 4 at 8pm on Tuesday"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
