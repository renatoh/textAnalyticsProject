Airports warned travelers \u2013 Americans returning home and foreign visitors \u2013 of delays, and some tweeted photos and videos of huge lines. A CBP spokeswoman said the systems were running again by early evening on the east coast. The agency didn\u2019t precisely describe the breakdown, but the spokeswoman said there was \u201cno indication of any nefarious activity\u201d. She said officers were able to access security-related databases and maintain security standards while screening people manually. Rebekah Tromble, an associate professor at George Washington University, tweeted a video clip in which she panned over the arrival hall at Dulles international airport in northern Virginia. She estimated there were at least 5,000 people packed into the hall. Airports in Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York and elsewhere notified travelers of potential delays at the beginning of one of the last weekends of the summer vacation season. The port authority that operates New York\u2019s JFK airport and the airport in Newark, New Jersey, said additional staff and police officers monitored situation and helped where needed. Los Angeles international airport said it sent staffers to CBP areas to help direct travelers. CBP tweeted Friday evening that it was continuing to monitor the incident, and that there was \u201cno indication the disruption was malicious in nature at this time\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
