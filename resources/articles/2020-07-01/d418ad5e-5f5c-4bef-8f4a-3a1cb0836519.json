The rapper posted three images on Instagram, one featuring the caption \u201c#Preggers\u201d and another reading: \u201cLove. Marriage. Baby carriage. Overflowing with excitement &amp; gratitude. Thank you all for the well wishes.\u201d The father is Kenneth Petty, who Minaj married in 2019. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be as refreshing and calming as it is,\u201d Minaj has said of her marriage. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not married, when you have someone that feels like your soulmate or someone who understands you, it just makes you feel like you\u2019re on top of the world.\u201d Petty was convicted of attempted rape in 1995, and earlier this year, he pleaded not guilty when charged with failing to register himself as a sex offender after moving to California from New York, with a trial date yet to be set. He served a seven-year sentence for a 2006 manslaughter conviction, stemming from a 2002 shooting. Having never scored a No 1 hit in the US before, Minaj has topped the US charts twice this year, first in May with her remix to Doja Cat\u2019s single Say So, and then in June with Trollz, her track with 6ix9ine. Her most recent album was Queen in 2018."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
