The first stage is the dutiful stepchild: wide-eyed, grateful, tremulously in thrall to these manly invincibles. Then comes a middle period of cajoling big brotherdom, the years of tortured hope where anything seems possible and you just think if only the lads could, you know, if they could only just, if the lads could \u2026 Finally, submerged beneath a coastal shelf of accumulated disappointments you enter the mother-in-law phase. Nothing makes you happy. Nothing is ever good enough. We should have been German instead \u2013 and don't think we didn't have offers. In the past week I seem to have located another stage, a hidden fourth gear of England fandom that is a little more well disposed, infused with an urge to forgive and forget, to hug these dear cowering creatures to your yolk-stained dressing gown. This state of benevolent senility is, I believe, a reaction to a new kind of rock bottom being reached. England are playing Spain on Saturday, at home, and nobody thinks they can win. Really: nobody. It doesn't even matter when you read this article, before or after the match: the fact of Spain's fluent, domineering 3-0 victory has already been established long in advance of kick off. We know that England didn't get/won't have got much of the ball. That David Villa's second goal was/will have been a lovely, slick finish. That Xavi made/is about to make 732 passes, 98% of them accurate to within 0.6 of a toenail. And that Joleon Lescott won't want to see that moment late in the first half again too often. This is perhaps understandable given that they are playing the world champions. But there is something else too, an unusual case of footballing symmetry. Spain's all-time greatest team will be on show at Wembley. Their opponents, meanwhile, have a decent claim to being England's worst team of the modern era, perhaps of all time. This isn't just an emotive response to being extreme outsiders. There is evidence to back it up. No player in the current England squad has won a European trophy. There are no Ballon d'Or nominees and just one previous PFA player of the year, while only seven out of 25 have played at an international tournament. England have qualified for Euro 2012, but this was achieved by narrowly edging out Montenegro. Even Graham Taylor's USA '94 absentees had the good grace to lose to Holland and the best Norwegian team ever, the Gjolden Gjeneration of Lars Bohinen, Erik \"the Mosquito\" Mykland and many others I could choose to Google. There is plenty of competition for the accolade of England's worst. Some might point to the second-string Oceania tour of 1991 (star turn: John Salako) or the execrable 2-0 defeat to the US in the humid fug of late Taylor systems collapse. There was also a World Cup qualifier away in Finland in 2001 that lingers in the memory like the stain on the back of an airport departure lounge headrest left by Ray Parlour's overly moussed hair. But things have change slightly. In the past there were always excuses. The manager has gone mad. The manager has picked the wrong team. The players are tired/bored/suffering from basic tactical confusion. England missed out on two World Cups in the 1970s but this is still seen as a management failure. The team that lost 7-1 in Hungary in 1953 can also be excused. This was first contact, a slaughter of innocents. Who knew then that the foreigner was capable of such things? This time, though, there are no excuses. It is all quite bracingly up front. England are managed by Fabio Capello, who is, for all the don't speak the lingo carping, highly competent. And these are England's best players, give or take the odd galloping right-back preference. They aren't underachieving: this is really them, unsheathed before us in all their gloriously disarming mediocrity. This is cast into greater relief by the fact England are playing Spain, a team that is, among many other things, a kind of anti-England, a shadow world of right choices, positive action, controlled modernity. Spain have produced a team that is as close to unbeatable as any has ever been: masters of the new football where the collision of variables has been superseded by egalitarian team hustle and where, as a result, superior technique will always triumph. It turns out you can revise for football: shorn up behind those teenage years of skill refinement, Spain have brought us a brand of nerd-ball invincibility; a triumph of cerebral refinement, the revenge of the seven stone weakling and the boy who always did his homework himself. This is old news, but it has some bearing on the status of England's current XI. Denuded of Wayne Rooney it is evident more than ever that a kind of talent void has been allowed to open up. There are greenshoots at the bottom end and there are lingering gilded thirtysomethings, but, in between, the smash and grab Premier League has produced very little for the national team. And this is what Wembley will see in an England shirt, talent that has bloomed in spite of its environment, creeping up through the cracks of institutional indifference. This is why we should perhaps just enjoy the collision of total opposites. Our own lost generation against the outright historical ascendancy of Spain, who have pretty much a free hit here. England does not expect. And faced, at last, with the long-awaited liberation of being complete outsiders it is hard not to feel curious and even quite proud of these mid-20s drifters, self-propelling survivors who must carry the burden of a very modern kind of nadir."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
