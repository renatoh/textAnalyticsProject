In the time-honoured tradition of sexism in the workplace, her big promotion begins with a good-natured ribbing by the young male DS in her team. \u201cYou should show a bit more respect to your new boss,\u201d bats back Goode, played by Keeley Hawes. \u201cFirst job, day one,\u201d says DS Andy Craig as they walk up a grim corridor to an office full of bulky computer monitors and predominantly white officers. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s a good one.\u201d Goode firmly replies: \u201cThey\u2019re all good ones.\u201d This is how Honour (ITV) opens. The lens is tightly focused not on the real-life case that follows \u2013 the rape, torture, and murder of 20-year-old Banaz Mahmod in 2006 by five members of her family \u2013 but on Goode\u2019s laudable resolve to bring Mahmod\u2019s killers to justice. For this, Honour has been criticised \u2013 which is understandable. A drama about \u201chonour-based\u201d violence set in the community and made by those who understand it has yet to be made, and 100% deserves to be greenlit. That doesn\u2019t invalidate Honour, but it does raise the stakes on what we expect of it. Thankfully, this is no white-saviour narrative. The central theme of Gwyneth Hughes\u2019 taut and nuanced two-parter is the police force\u2019s abject failure to protect a terrified British citizen who sought their help on five separate occasions. Yes, five. There are two deep-rooted cankers at work here: the misogyny that feeds \u201chonour-based\u201d violence in a small number of communities, and the racial bias and institutional racism that festers in the police force. Together they created the toxic brew that led to a young woman being murdered for kissing her boyfriend outside a tube station. For, as Banaz\u2019s sister Bekhal puts it in a chilling scene, \u201cwanting a life\u201d. In the opening episode, Goode discovers just how astronomically Banaz has been let down. Three days before she went missing, she handed in a list of suspects, all men in her family who she said were intent on killing her, and nothing was done. An officer who visited her in hospital after she had been attacked by her father called her \u201chysterical\u201d and considered charging her with criminal damage to a broken window. There is even a videotape in which she calmly gives a statement in a police station: \u201cThat\u2019s why I came. In the future, if anything happens to me \u2026 it\u2019s them.\u201d This is not some slightly far-fetched addition, by the way, created for the purposes of dramatisation. The videotape exists. \u201cHow much more of their job did they want her to do for them?\u201d asks Goode, tight-lipped and raging. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re as confused as I am,\u201d DS Craig replies, \u201cToo many names, gov.\u201d The othering is so casual, so cumulatively insidious. In brief scenes like this, Hughes\u2019 writing is a masterclass in showing rather than telling. The interviews with Banaz\u2019s family are, unfortunately, less convincing. Too rushed. Too undelineated. There should be more from Bekhal, who in many ways is the true hero of this story, and Rahmat, the broken boyfriend whose scenes are made all the more tragic by the knowledge that he ended his life a decade later. Likewise, Banaz\u2019s parents, who remain trapped in their too-often-stereotyped roles as intransigent father and silent \u2013 perhaps silenced \u2013 mother. Still, Honour possesses a quiet authenticity that comes partly from Hawes \u2013 her performance is a study in controlled anguish \u2013 and partly from the way it was brought to television. Both the real-life Goode and Bekhal, who has lived in witness protection since she helped the police with the prosecution, consulted on the production, and it shows, not least in the meeting in which the chief superintendent falls back on white liberalism as a justification for negligence: \u201cWe must avoid suggesting Kurdish men are unusually prone to honour killing.\u201d Or when British Kurdish activist Diana Nammi tells Goode that the men in the community \u201cwill laugh when they hear the senior investigating officer is a woman\u201d. And when Goode calls in the female officer who refused to believe Banaz in hospital \u2026 and, surprise, surprise, wrote her name down incorrectly. \u201c\u2018Attention-seeking, hysterical, self-harming,\u2019\u201d Goode yells at her. \u201cHer own father had just tried to kill her, so \u2026 what the fuck?\u201d \u201cHow was I supposed to know?\u201d the officer replies, cool as a cucumber. \u201cI\u2019ve had no training in honour violence.\u201d She remains breathtakingly unrepentant. The scene ends with her saying she would do the same thing again, the injustice continuing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
