The provenance of this latest version, though, is undisputed; in August 1954, less than four months before his death, Furtw\u00e4ngler conducted the symphony at Bayreuth once again, with four festival stalwarts as his soloists. The original radio tapes of the performance have been lost, so this disc is presumably (the sleeve notes are rather vague) based upon a recording taken from the broadcast itself. The restored sound is poor, but the electricity of the performance \u2013 the power of its climaxes and dramatic intensity \u2013 is unmistakable. Furtw\u00e4ngler fans will certainly want to hear this account. But for those who just want a recording of the Ninth conducted by one of its greatest interpreters, the EMI disc \u2013 which sounds far better \u2013 is the one to get."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
