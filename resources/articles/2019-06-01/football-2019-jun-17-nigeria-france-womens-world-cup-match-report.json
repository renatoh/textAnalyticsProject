Nigeria\u2019s hopes of a third-place finish now hang by a thread. \u201cIf I gave you honest opinions, they would probably send me home,\u201d he said, bluntly. When asked about his team\u2019s performance, he replied: \u201cMy players are heroes.\u201d The France manager, Corinne Diacre, was pleased to benefit from the referee following the letter of the law. \u201cThere are new rules so we know that the goalkeeper has to have at least one foot on the line, which wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why she was given a yellow card and that was a little bit severe for her but we have to apply the rules.\u201d With the sun setting, the Rennes ultras \u2013 known for their flares, flags, coordinated celebrations, drums and constant singing \u2013 were out in force for Les Bleues. France laboured early on, though, against a side that secured a surprise three points against the run of play in a 2-0 defeat of South Korea. The four changes to the French starting XI \u2013 leaving out the Lyon forwards Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer and Kadidiatou Diani \u2013 had clearly disrupted their rhythm. Delphine Cascarino was by far their brightest outlet on the right, causing problems for the left-back, Ngozi Ebere, who eventually picked up a yellow card for clearing out the 22-year\u2011old, but without Diani and Le Sommer, and Val\u00e9rie Gauvin quiet, Cascarino was forced to resort to playing for corners rather than whipping balls into more dangerous areas. Neither side had a first-half shot on target \u2013 the second game of the tournament to have done so, Argentina\u2019s stalemate with Japan the other. A volley wide of the near post from Amandine Henry was perhaps the best attempt of a lacklustre half. As the teams came out of the tunnel for the second half mobile phone lights were held aloft, perhaps hoping to prompt a more electric response on the pitch. France looked to match the instant breakthrough they made against Norway, a Ga\u00ebtane Thiney free-kick was whipped on to the head of Renard but she could not direct it goalwards. There was more purpose to France\u2019s play. Amel Majri and Viviane Asseyi looked to even up their lopsided attack on the left, but the latter\u2019s mazy runs were lacking the final ball, short passes being picked off with ease by the organised Nigeria backline. France should have taken the lead when, under no pressure, Thiney fired wide of the goal after a Cascarino cut-back. In order to reinstate some fluidity, on came Diani and Le Sommer to a roar of delight from the crowd. Asseyi, now out wide in Cascarino\u2019s place, instantly looked better for the move. The changes to the line-up suggested that Diacre had underestimated her opposition. This is a much better prepared Super Falcons team than the one that did not have a game between the 2016 African Cup of Nations and April 2018. They have often had quality players to make up for severe underfunding but under Dennerby they look a more professional outfit. It was a moment of madness that killed their hopes. Ebere received a second yellow for felling Asseyi from behind and up stepped Renard to take the spot kick after the Honduran referee, Melissa Borjas, had paused to consult the VAR. Renard\u2019s stuttering run and tame effort pinged off the post but after another VAR check Chiamaka Nnadozie was adjudged to have moved off her line before the ball was hit and Renard had a shot at redemption, this time making no mistake. \u201cEugenie came to me and said: \u2018No, you\u2019re going to be the one to take the spot kick,\u2019\u201d said Renard of her second attempt. \u201cI was lucky enough to take it the second time and it was very good for the team and me as well.\u201d \u201cOf course, I\u2019m disappointed with the result,\u201d said Dennerby, before throwing down his earpiece at the conclusion of the press conference. \u201cFrance is a really good team and they don\u2019t need support to win games. So I feel so sorry because the girls were fighting so well and they followed the match plan and it\u2019s getting destroyed by people that we are not happy with.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 June 2019 to correct a misspelling of Les Bleues as Les Bleus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
