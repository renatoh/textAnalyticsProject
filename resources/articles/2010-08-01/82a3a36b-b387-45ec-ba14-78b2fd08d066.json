We simply advised members to seek advice from their union and get representation before agreeing to go into any meetings. This is standard practice and helps ensure that the correct procedures are being followed and that staff are not put under undue pressure. We are committed to ensuring UKBA \u2013 in common with all the departments, agencies and organisations where our members work \u2013 enforce their legal duties to promote equality. Nobody has done more than PCS to push the equality agenda with civil service employers, and we will continue to press for improvements.
