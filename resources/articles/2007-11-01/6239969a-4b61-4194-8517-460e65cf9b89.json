For the past 27 years he's put it to fine use, hosting London's longest-running one-nighter, Gaz's Rockin' Blues, at Soho's St Moritz, which effortlessly fuses crazy party music from every decade together with a real sense of showmanship. Journeys outside the capital are fairly rare, so Friday's trip down the M4 should be one to savour. Gaz will be at Bristol's Tube to help celebrate its second birthday, during which time the place has chiselled out a fine reputation with intimate sets from stars such as James Lavelle, Slipmatt, David Holmes and Groove Armada. Support is from John Stapleton and the legendary Lula; and, for four quid, only the criminally insane would try to look for a better value night out. John Mitchell \u00b7 The Tube, Unity Street, Fri 30 Defected presents... London Strictly Rhythm In The House heads prepare to get very excited indeed - so excited that you may find it beneficial to have a spare pants on standby. Got 'em? Good, then we shall begin. New York house legend and all round demi-deity Todd Terry is heading to the Ministry Of Sound for a rare UK appearance. Terry is not only one of the best paid DJs in the world (so no need to go round buying him drinks if you bump into him in the bogs), but he's also to 1980s house music what Che Guevara is to being a complete bum-kicking, cool-looking revolutionary. Tonight he's fronting a set of seminal scene sounds to promote his new album, 'Strictly' Todd Terry. Elsewhere, Defected's Copyright and Andy Daniell will also be sharing some stormers, and Phil Cheeseman - the original Strictly label manager - will be alongside BBC Xtra's Aaron Ross, playing all the Strictly classics you could ever wish for. Leonie Cooper \u00b7 Ministry Of Sound, SE1, Sat 24 Lights Down Low Sheffield It makes all the difference to a club night when a venue is finally found that's willing to work alongside the promoter, rather than at odds with them. Relatively new concern Penelope's in Sheffield must be doing something right, as in their short tenure on Arundel Gate, they've already managed, with Kabal and Lights Down Low, to court two of the city's friendliest monthly parties to the venue. At this Friday's Lights Down Low, Radio 1 Xtra's club spinner Benji B, from the Deviation show, makes yet another trip up north, the ever frequent journeys attesting to the rising popularity of this exciting, freestyle DJ, just one of a number of British DJs who currently seem to be rivalling American imports for bookings in our dance clubs. He joins the residents and the young, sussed, reasonably small crowd for five hours of hip-hop, disco, soul, jazz and techno. Marc Rowlands \u00b7 Penelope's, Arundel Gate, Fri 30 The Kitchen Meets The Shaft Dublin Club genealogists, if such a ludicrous concept even existed, would have an easy job tracing any city's clubbing heritage back to the places where, 20 or so years ago, chart-friendly pop and disco beget the more exotic sound which we call dance music. In Dublin, The Kitchen and The Shaft were the spawning grounds for dance culture in Ireland, the former being located in the basement of the U2-owned Clarence Hotel and the latter recognised as the city's first truly underground club. Many of the original DJs are still at the forefront of the local dance music scene and, tonight, nine of the best are regrouping for a fundraiser in aid of sick children. Patric Baird \u00b7 Traffic, Middle Abbey Street, Sat 24 Say Yes London From the dirty disco minds of Rory Philips - Trash's Robin to Erol Alkan's Batman - and And Did We Mention Our Disco stalwart and Queen of the bangers, Nadia Ksaiba, comes Say Yes, a monthy bash that seems set to be where the cool lose their composure over the coming year. The recently revamped (by the folk behind Camden's Lock Tavern) Amersham Arms seems to be fast morphing into party central, with New Cross enjoying its fifth revival in as many years. Tonight's launch party sees the pair invite Parisian's Zombie Zombie to play their Suicide-meets-Can in a dark alley; think of them as an electro horror flick you can dance to. Independent music mentals Mock &amp; Toof will then play party tunes to make everyone shimmy, and Rory and Nadia will, of course, be DJing as well; if you've still got your dancing feet we suggest you put them to their proper use.
