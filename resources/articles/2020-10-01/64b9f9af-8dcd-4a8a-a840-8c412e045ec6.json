The complaint filed on Tuesday by Northwest Center for Alternatives to Pesticide (NCAP), Willamette Riverkeeper, Cascadia Wildlands, Neighbors for Clean Air (NCA), 350 Portland and the ACLU of Oregon names the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its acting secretary, Chad Wolf, as defendants. It seeks remedies for what it calls \u201cmonths of sustained, repeated, high-volume use of teargas and other chemical munitions\u201d in response to demonstrations in Portland. The suit, which if successful may open up a new way of limiting the use of such munitions by law enforcement, cites the National Environmental Protection Act (Nepa), which it says \u201cobligates Defendants to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA), an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), to adhere to its own emergency protocols\u201d. In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege the DHS\u2019s use of gas weapons has been \u201cso excessive and substantial that visible munitions residue and sediment have accumulated in and on Portland\u2019s streets, sidewalks, curbs, bioswales, stormwater system, buildings, standing water, and [have] been transported and conveyed to the Willamette River banks and waters\u201d. The complaint cites EPA standards on airborne gases and human health, saying that there \u201cis no level of CS gas exposure\u201d that meets the EPA\u2019s \u201cno effect\u201d standard, or the definition for effects which are \u201cnot disabling and are transient and reversible\u201d, saying that exposure may increase the risks, for human and animals, of ailments including cancer, organ damage, serious eye damage and suffocation. It also cites a US army report from 2014 which showed that recruits exposed to teargas in basic training had a \u201c2.5-times greater risk of being diagnosed with acute respiratory illness\u201d. It also raises the prospect of environmental damage, saying gas residues have entered the city\u2019s drainage system, and the Willamette River, and the resultant \u201caquatic toxicity\u201d may harm or kill terrestrial and aquatic animals, including threatened salmon species that spawn in the area. The complaint also alleges that the DHS has resisted attempts to learn more about the chemicals, and that there are no public standards around the manufacture of such weapons. It seeks a declaration that the DHS violated Nepa, and an injunction against further use of teargas until an EA and an EIS are completed. Kelly Simon, interim legal director for the ACLU of Oregon, said: \u201cEnvironmental justice is racial justice. Environmental hazards and police violence disproportionately deny that right to Black, Indigenous, Latinx and other people of color.\u201d The suit is one of many which has been brought against local and federal agencies during months of continuous protest in the city since the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer triggered a summer of civil unrest and anti-racism demonstrations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
