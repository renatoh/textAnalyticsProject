Billions of hours of farmwork has been lost during high temperatures and global warming has damaged the ability to grow crops, it said. The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change was produced by 150 experts from 27 universities and institutions including the World Health Organization and the World Bank. \u201cThe findings are clear and the stakes could not be higher,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general. \u201cWe cannot delay action on climate change. We cannot sleepwalk through this health emergency any longer.\u201d The report sets out the impacts of global warming on health in stark terms. \u201dA rapidly changing climate has dire implications for every aspect of human life, exposing vulnerable populations to extremes of weather, altering patterns of infectious disease, and compromising food security, safe drinking water and clean air,\u201d it said. Nick Watt, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown, said: \u201cThese are not things happening in 2050 but are things we are already seeing today. We think of these as the canary in, ironically, the coalmine.\u201d On Tuesday the UN said action to cut carbon emissions must be tripled to avoid catastrophic warming. International climate change negotiations were due to resume on Monday in Poland. The Lancet report said the lack of progress \u201cthreatens both human lives and the viability of the national health systems they depend on, with the potential to overwhelm health services\u201d. A survey in the report of leaders of almost 500 global cities found half expected their public health infrastructure to be seriously compromised by climate change, meaning systemic failures such as the shutdown of hospitals. A heatwave in Europe this summer was linked to hundreds of premature deaths in the UK alone. MPs said in July that the UK was \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d for heatwaves. The Lancet report says populations in Europe and the eastern Mediterranean are at higher risk than those in Africa and south-east Asia because of the high proportion of vulnerable and elderly people living in cities. As temperatures rise across the world, the report says 157 million more vulnerable people were subjected to a heatwave in 2017 than in 2000. Hot conditions directly damage health via heatstroke, but dehydration and exacerbation of conditions such as heart disease are also very dangerous. Heat also worsens air pollution and mental health problems. Prof Kristie Ebi, of the University of Washington, said: \u201cIncreased mortality in extreme heatwaves is happening now [but] there is abundant evidence that communities are not prepared for the ongoing increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves.\u201d The Lancet report said 153bn hours of work were lost in 2017 due to extreme heat, 80% of it in agriculture. Almost half the losses were in India, equivalent to 7% of its total working population, while China lost the equivalent of 1.4% of its workers. \u201cThis has led to vast losses for national economies and household budgets,\u201d said Prof Joacim Rockl\u00f6v of Ume\u00e5 University in Sweden. Relatively small changes in temperatures and rainfall could cause large changes in the transmission of infectious diseases spread via water and mosquitoes. The ability of the dengue fever virus to be transmitted \u2013 its \u201cvectorial capacity\u201d \u2013 reached a record high in 2016, according to the report, 10% above a 1950s baseline. The danger from cholera risk was also rising in regions such as the Baltic states where the sea has been warming rapidly. Doctors not involved in the report said it presented convincing evidence. \u201cIt is clear that climate change is directly impacting our health,\u201d said Howard Frumkin, head of the Wellcome Trust\u2019s Our Planet, Our Health programme. \u201cAll sectors must prioritise action on climate change if we are to significantly reduce the potentially devastating impact on our planet and our health, affecting generations to come.\u201d Prof Paul Ekins, of University College London, said the health benefits of tackling climate change had long been undervalued, with just 5% of funding for adaptation to global warming being spent on health. \u201cThese benefits are enormous, near-term and affect our health immediately,\u201d Ekins said. \u201cIf you factor in these benefits, cutting emissions to [keep the temperature rise below] 1.5C is going to be a net benefit to humanity in monetary terms.\u201d The Lancet report noted some promising trends, such as the phase-out of coal and the growth of electric cars. Prof Hilary Graham, of the University of York and part of the Lancet Countdown team, said linking health and climate change could help spur further action. \u201cHealth is what people feel. It makes a direct connection with their lives and the lives of people they care about like their children and grandchildren.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
