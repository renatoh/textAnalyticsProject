The president, Boris Tadic, told cheering supporters that his Coalition for a European Serbia had pulled off a convincing victory, after early results gave it a 10-point lead over the ultranationalist Serbian Radical party. But it was unclear whether the president's party would be able to form the next government, because smaller blocs may yet side with the nationalists. With about half of the vote counted, the Centre for Free Elections and Democracy said Tadic's bloc had won \"a very convincing victory\", with about 39% of the vote. The Serbian Radical party, led by Tomislav Nikolic, won 28.6%. Vojislav Kostunica, the nationalist prime minister who triggered the elections by breaking with the president over Kosovan independence, saw his conservative bloc get 11.6%. The Socialist party, which endured a steep decline after its leader Slobodan Milosevic was ousted in 2000, appeared to make unexpected gains, with about 8.2%, and could play a crucial role in the makeup of the next government. The figures would give Tadic's coalition a total of 103 seats in the 250-seat assembly. But Nikolic's Radicals could form a plurality with like-minded parties, which together took 48.4% of the votes. \"Serbs have undoubtedly confirmed a clear European path for Serbia,\" Tadic told supporters at his Democratic party headquarters. \"Serbia will be in the European Union. We have promised that, and we will fulfill that.\" But he also sought to rebuff nationalist claims that his pro-EU camp would give up on Kosovo, the province in southern Serbia which declared independence in February. \"The government we will form will not recognise Kosovo,\" he added. Before the vote, analysts had predicted that fury at international support for Kosovo's declaration of independence would translate into a huge swing to the Radicals that could, in turn, push Serbia into fresh isolation. The EU welcomed the projected outcome of the election and promised Serbia faster movement towards EU membership. \"It seems [President Boris] Tadic's Democrats will have a more important role, which makes me happy,\" Dimitrij Rupel, the foreign minister of Slovenia, which holds the rotating EU presidency, told Reuters. \"This means Serbia will move forward ever faster to EU membership. \"I think that the policy of the EU was correct, that we were right to be stubborn.\" But Serbia's fate may yet be sealed by political dealmaking after the poll. With neither of the two main parties winning outright, two blocs are in a key position to decide who will form the government: Kostunica's and the Socialist party. The nationalist prime minister has moved closer to the Radicals' position over Kosovo and is unlikely to renew his alliance with Tadic's Democrats, whom he accuses of selling out to the EU. \"It's very important that a government is formed quickly after the election so we can continue the policy of preserving the state's integrity,\" Kostunica said after casting his ballot. Tadic said he would never allow nationalists to regain power, and would name a new prime minister from his own coalition, but Nikolic warned that the president would be in breach of the constitution if he tried to rule out a coalition of nationalists. The Socialists were keeping their powder dry last night. \"Let's wait until tomorrow and see what we'll do,\" the party's deputy leader, Zarko Obradovic, said, adding that it was the Socialists' best result since Milosevic was ousted in 2000. Officials said the turnout was about 60% - lower than in January's presidential election, but high for a parliamentary vote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
