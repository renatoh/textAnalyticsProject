Only this time she meant it. Four years of incessant touring, a series of flawless pop singles that earned diminishing returns and a depressing trail of lawsuits had convinced her to quit the music business for good. She was 19 years old. Other than a one-off reunion at CBGBs in 1977 and an uncredited backing vocal on Aerosmith's cover of the Shangri-Las' hit Out in the Streets, she stayed true to her word - until earlier this month, when Weiss announced her return with a sold-out gig in Cleveland, Ohio. The record she declines to call a comeback, Dangerous Game, was released last week in the US. \"When I drop something, I really drop it,\" she says. \"My mom signed my life away, unintentionally, so I couldn't go near a record label for 10 years, and I was in litigation for 30.\" She became a commercial designer, and eventually clients stopped asking for her autograph. But then she met the owners of Norton Records, who wondered if she might be interested in making a new album. \"I really kicked it around,\" she says, \"I went through a lot of changes in my life. I lost my mom, my brother died. Sometimes it's just time to regroup and say, 'Is this what I really want to do, or do I want to go back to something else?' \"The first show was surreal. Somebody handed me a dozen yellow roses, and the signing at the theatre lasted two hours. Being on stage the first time without the girls there was odd, but then everything I'm doing now is new.\" The Shangri-Las bust out of suburban New York in 1964, two pairs of sisters in street-tough catsuits and shiny boots singing Remember (Walkin' in the Sand). Their producer, George \"Shadow\" Morton, had a knack for capturing teenage angst on tape. Songwriters Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry supplied mini-operas that frequently ended in death, from the couple in Give Us Your Blessings whose tears cause a car crash to the mother of I Can Never Go Home Any More, heartbroken after her daughter ran away, who \"grew so lonesome in the end, the angels picked her for their friend\". The biggest \"death disc\" of all, The Leader of the Pack, was initially banned in Britain owing to fears that it would incite mods and rockers to violence, but it became a huge hit on its rerelease in 1972 and 1976. Blondie liked Out in the Streets so much they covered it twice, and the New York Dolls borrowed the intro to Give Him a Great Big Kiss (\"When I say I'm in love, you best believe I'm in LUV, L-U V!\"). When Johnny Marr was looking for a songwriting partner, he set out to find \"someone else who could appreciate the Shangri-Las ... and that was Morrissey\". Dangerous Game was largely written by Greg Cartwright, of garage-rock band the Reigning Sound. It avoids mimicking Morton's production, but offers heartbreak and betrayal by way of continuity. \"What we wanted to do was to have a hint, a taste, so it would have the feel without going there,\" Weiss says. \"I always knew that if I went back into the studio, it wouldn't be to do something old. People sent me a lot of death songs to sing, but that's not me and I don't go backwards.\" She remembers touring as a \"grinding mess\" and has no plans to try it again. She is also reluctant to mine her back catalogue, beyond a couple of B-sides. Quite apart from the difficulty of recreating girl-group harmonies without her sister, Betty, and the Ganser twins, Weiss is determined never to front a nostalgia show. \"It's possible that I'll throw one in there, but that's as far as it goes,\" she says, firmly. \u00b7 Dangerous Game is out now on Norton"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
