'It's the right thing to do in terms of the well-being of the horse and being fair to everybody concerned,' Webbon said. 'It's a great disappointment, and it might conceivably have been possible to try and press on with him, but realistically, once something like this has happened to a horse, the best thing for it is a good period of rest.' Webbon added that it is relatively common for a horse to rupture a blood vessel in its lung when exercising or racing. 'In the vast majority of cases,' he said, 'you won't be aware that it's happened unless you actually look inside the horse's windpipe with an endoscope. Only a very small proportion of those horses that do bleed like that will show it at their nostrils. For that to happen [as it did in this case], there has to be a reasonable volume of blood there.' Dr David Marlin, head of physiology at the Animal Health Trust in Newmarket, explained: 'The thickness of the [vessel] walls that keeps the blood in and doesn't let it into [a horse's] airways is only one-hundredth of the thickness of a human hair. 'It's not surprising that some of these delicate membranes get damaged during strenuous exercise. 'All horses will break some of those tiny blood vessels. That becomes a problem when a very large number of them break.' In the long term, however, Webbon believes there is no reason why Best Mate should not return to try and win the Gold Cup for a fourth time in 2006. 'Providing [Best Mate] has a period of rest and any inflammation of the lungs is allowed to settle down, then there's no reason why it should occur again with any more frequency than it would in any other horse.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
