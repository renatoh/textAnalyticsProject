What could go wrong?", "bodyText": "My dad\u2019s latest contribution to the family WhatsApp group was a meme. One that he\u2019d forwarded, possibly from another dad. It\u2019s an illustration of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, walking side by side, with the caption: \u201cBack the fuck up Piglet.\u201d It\u2019s not that the global pandemic has caused my 64-year-old father to discover memes; it\u2019s more that he\u2019s now come to truly appreciate them. He tells me he has \u201c20 coming in a day, from various sources\u201d. Like a meme sommelier, he\u2019s become very selective about which ones he forwards to the family thread. And his taste isn\u2019t bad. A little schlocky at times, but surprisingly acceptable for someone of a generation whose online presence is largely defined by jpegs of inspirational quotes and below-the-line bigotry. The overflow he sends to my uncle. I imagine the two of them pinging each other the latest corona content, in a sort of quarantined baby-boomer version of tennis. \u201cWe\u2019ve got time,\u201d he says, when I ask him why his generation is getting so into memes. My dad isn\u2019t retired, and he\u2019s one of the busiest people I know. So I\u2019m not sure how this applies to him. I wonder if you become more present as you get older \u2013 and maybe seem to have more time. Is he living out these \u201cstrange times\u201d in a zen state, contemplating each new meme like a teaching of the Dalai Lama? \u201cBy the way,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ve joined Houseparty.\u201d In these times of crisis, I\u2019d rather have this irreverent sort of dad than the \u201chysterically blaming coronavirus on 5G\u201d kind. Although that picture of a train car marked \u201cCovid-19\u201d did somehow make its way onto the family thread. Tweets about parents spreading fake news about how to cure Covid-19 have become a meme in themselves. Like a virus within a virus are the screenshots of mums telling their adult kids to binge-eat garlic, huff bleach or \u2013 according to one viral tweet \u2013 \u201cput an onion in the corner of every room in the house\u201d. \u201cMy mum has a PhD on coronavirus from WhatsApp university,\u201d tweeted one user. Variations on this joke have now been posted by hundreds of other Twitter users. Another character to have emerged is the protective yet slightly deranged mama bear, yell-typing at her cubs to batten down the hatches and listen up because her friend Maureen from Zumba wrote a very compelling Facebook post on the healing power of dishwasher salt. But it\u2019s not just the \u201cgullible mums\u201d disseminating misinformation like sugar-crazed toddlers throwing confetti at a wedding. My partner regularly has to tell off her 75-year-old dad for his factually dubious forwarded emails. (Although his latest offering, with the subject line \u00c0 m\u00e9diter, is actually a thoughtful essay on the pandemic, which originally appeared in Le Monde. My French isn\u2019t good enough to understand the full text, but an uninformed glance tells me it\u2019s deeply existential.) There appear to be three types of pandemic parent: the insouciant, the paranoid and the contemplative. Some straddle all three. The insouciant needs to be begged to stop going to the pub, but also creates the best content: the dads dancing with their teenage daughters on TikTok, the mums of younger kids churning out funny tweets about home-schooling. In one TikTok video, a dad acts as a bouncer and a mum a bartender, having turned their garage into a nightclub for their son\u2019s 21st birthday. These creatively supercharged boomers are \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 making lockdown slightly less terrible. They\u2019re trying so hard to \u201cmake the best of a bad situation\u201d and \u201clive, laugh, love\u201d their way through it that \u2013 you have to hand it to them \u2013 they\u2019re kind of succeeding. Or at least allowing us to forget about the slow collapse of civilisation in viral, 30-second blasts. In the past few weeks, we\u2019ve all seen those irritating references to the great works of art and literature supposedly created during quarantine, such as Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear. What if that video of a dad pretending to be Basil Fawlty while serving his kids dinner is quarantine\u2019s King Lear? There\u2019s certainly nothing more reflective of the zeitgeist than stir-crazy parents dispensing with their inhibitions; parents in lockdown are doing the \u201clong suffering but cheerful\u201d thing like never before. This is their time to shine, and we should probably just sit back and enjoy the results. The contemplative parents don\u2019t require as much attention. They\u2019re too busy zenning out to memes, or reading French essays. And even the paranoid parents deserve a break. After all, they\u2019re just trying to help, even if their idea of \u201chelping\u201d happens to be sourcing all of their information on a gravely urgent situation from satirical news sites and anti-vaxx forums. They (accidentally) shitpost because they care. And, remember, not all of us have mums to tell us to beat the virus with a hairdryer. Be patient with yours, she means well.
