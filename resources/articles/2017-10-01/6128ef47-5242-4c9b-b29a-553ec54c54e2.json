Ludlam says he believed that citizenship had been revoked when he became an Australian citizen as a teenager but has since been proven wrong. 18 July: After Ludlam\u2019s case, the Queensland Greens senator, Larissa Waters, looks into her own background, having been born in Canada to Australian parents. It is revealed that a law change just days after her birth granted her Canadian citizenship, which, not knowing about it, she had never renounced. Waters resigns, sparking political attacks from the government over the Greens candidate vetting processes, which the prime minister says shows \u201cincredible sloppiness\u201d. 21 July: The One Nation Queensland senator Malcolm Roberts signs and publicises a statutory declaration after questions over his citizenship. \u201cI can confirm I am not a citizen of the United Kingdom, nor am I a citizen of India. I am a citizen of Australia only.\u201d 25 July: Matt Canavan, the Nationals senator from Queensland and resources minister, announces his mother applied for Italian citizenship on his behalf, without his knowledge, when he was 25. He resigns from the cabinet but not the Senate. Barnaby Joyce absorbs his ministries. 26 July: A spokesman for Roberts says \u201cany renunciation\u201d occurred on 6 June 2016 but his office continues to refuse to release the paperwork its says proves it. Pauline Hanson announces she has seen the documents and declares \u201chand on heart\u201d Roberts renounced his UK citizenship before he nominated for Pparliament. The following day, a spokesman for Roberts tells Fairfax Media the senator was \u201cchoosing to believe he was never British\u201d. 27 July: Roberts appears on Sky News with Paul Murray to prove his renunciation documents are in order. Murray says he has seen and read the documents \u201cthat are a million per cent correct\u201d. The documents are not shown on screen. 9 August: Roberts\u2019s case is referred to the high court. 14 August: Barnaby Joyce becomes the first lower house MP to become embroiled in the section 44 crisis when he confirms he is a citizen of descent of New Zealand through his father. He refers himself to the high court but remains in cabinet. 15 August: A diplomatic brawl is sparked over claims from the Turnbull government that Australian Labor conspired with New Zealand Labour to bring Joyce\u2019s dual citizenship to light. 17 August: The deputy leader of the National party, Fiona Nash, announces she has investigated her citizenship status after Joyce\u2019s case and has discovered she holds UK citizenship by descent through her Scottish-born father. She refers herself to the high court but does not step down from her ministries. 18 August: The Senate powerbroker Nick Xenophon said he will refer himself to the high court after discovering he is a British overseas citizen. He says he renounced any citizenship of Greece or Cyprus but did not know he could also hold British citizenship. 21 September: Roberts is cross examined by the high court. It is revealed he sent emails enquiring into his UK citizenship status in the days before his nomination to defunct email addresses but had not filled out the official forms or paid a fee. Roberts maintains he believes he was never British and cites his Welsh-born father as never having \u201cribbed\u201d him about being so as part of his proof. 22 September: The high court finds Roberts was a dual citizen when he nominated for parliament. 26 September: In submissions to the high court, the attorney general, George Brandis, says senators Waters, Nash, Canavan and Xenophon, and the lower house MP Joyce, have similar cases as none knew of their citizenship by descent and therefore could not renounce it. Brandis argues they should be found not to have breached section 44 because of that ignorance. He says the cases of Ludlam and Roberts are separate and should not be included in that defence. 28 September: In a joint submission to the high court, Waters and Ludlam argue ignorance of dual citizenship should not be considered an excuse, in stark contrast to the attorney general\u2019s submission. Government MPs also put forward submissions where they argue citizenship by descent (which Canavan says he received when he was two years old, making his mother\u2019s actions irrelevant) which is not known should not be considered a breach of the constitution. 29 September: Roberts submits to the high court that he believes he did everything he could to renounce any claims to British citizenship, despite not believing he held it. 3 October: Joyce\u2019s political rival for the seat of New England, Tony Windsor, submits to the high court Joyce was ineligible for election and a byelection should be held. 6 October: Xenophon announces he will resign from the Senate no matter what the outcome of his section 44 case is to run for the South Australian parliament. The cases will be heard on 10, 11 and 12 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
