Only one thing is going to happen and it did. It smashed. The \u00a36,000 sculpture was part of an exhibit in a display at the Royal Academy's summer exhibition curated by Tracey Emin, who described the work as a star of her show. It was one of five totems by Costa Rican artist Tatiana Echeverri Fernandez, collectively titled Frauleins Christina, Panthea, Zenobia, Semiramis and Guinevere. Alas, the five frauleins are now four after a visitor fell into the cordoned off piece on Saturday, sending it to the floor and smashing into hundreds of pieces. A spokeswoman for the Royal Academy confirmed there had been an accident and conservators were deciding on the best course of action. Pictures of the incident's aftermath were taken by onlookers, something the RA took a dim view of to the point of threatening legal action against one person who had taken a picture of it. One witness, Clare San Martin, did not see the accident but heard it. \"It was an enormous crash,\" she said. \"Like pottery smashing. Everyone was standing around, and one woman, who I assumed had knocked it over, was standing with her hand on her head. \"After a while a person ran off to get help and someone came in with a dustpan to clean it up. Before that people were still coming in to the room and thought it was part of the exhibition. They were taking pictures. I think they thought it was meant to be like that. \"Two guards came in to keep people away and an official came to talk to the woman who knocked it. It was smashed. There were pieces everywhere.\" In a statement the RA said: \"On Saturday an exhibit was accidentally damaged by a visitor. The damaged work is Christina by Tatiana Echeverri Fernandez. The gallery was initially closed but later reopened. The Royal Academy of Arts has informed the artist, gallery curator and exhibition co-coordinator of this incident and are arranging for a conservator to come in to assess the damage so that we can inform our insurers. \"The RA recognised the vulnerability of these works, and much consultation took place as to how to best protect them. Those consulted included the artist and RA Security and art handlers. The barriers were arrived at as the best option. Summer Exhibition 2008 has got through its busiest period including many lively evening events where we were most concerned about the work, and it is disappointing that this has happened on a quiet Saturday afternoon.\" Emin, who is preparing for a show at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, was not available for comment. Fernandez did not wish to comment. The incident was arguably not as bad as the one involving a magnificent 45kg Qing vase at the Fitzwilliam museum in Cambridge. It was smashed when a man tripped over his shoelaces in January 2006. Although the 113 pieces were reassembled the vase lost a lot of value."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
