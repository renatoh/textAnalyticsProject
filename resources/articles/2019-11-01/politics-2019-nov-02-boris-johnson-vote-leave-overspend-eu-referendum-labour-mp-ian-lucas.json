The payment was subsequently ruled to be illegal. Ian Lucas revealed that he has seen correspondence obtained during the parliamentary inquiry into disinformation and democracy which showed that Johnson\u2019s most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, told the Electoral Commission that the prime minister, and his cabinet colleague Michael Gove, knew of the overspend by the pro-Brexit organisation. The Electoral Commission last year judged that Vote Leave had broken electoral law by overspending during the EU referendum, after the campaign funnelled \u00a3675,000 through another pro-Brexit group, BeLeave, to avoid spending limits. The revelation comes as it was confirmed that prosecutors have received a file of evidence from the Metropolitan Police that could lead to criminal charges against the Vote Leave campaign, which was spearheaded by Johnson and Cummings. After nearly 16 months of investigating Vote Leave, the Metropolitan Police has handed a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service and are seeking \u201cearly investigative advice\u201d on how to develop the case against the pro-Brexit organisation. Vote Leave has always denied any wrongdoing. Veteran Labour MP Lucas, who sat on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee inquiry into fake news, said the correspondence showing that the prime minister had apparently failed to report an offence raised serious questions over Johnson\u2019s judgement. Lucas told the Observer: \u201cJohnson and Gove both knew about the illegal payments to BeLeave. I\u2019ve seen it in writing. We finally forced the Electoral Commission to hand over its correspondence with Dominic Cummings; it\u2019s there in black and white. It\u2019s Cummings himself saying this.\u201d The Wrexham MP also revealed that the disclosure by Cummings was part of a strategy to protect the prime minister and Gove, with Johnson\u2019s chief adviser insisting that both politicians only discovered the overspend after the EU referendum vote, though it\u2019s unknown when exactly it is believed to be. \u201cThe astonishing thing is, he actually said this in the context of defending them. He said they didn\u2019t know at the time, they only knew after the referendum. That means he\u2019s been sitting on this information the entire time,\u201d said Lucas. He added: \u201cIt is totally unacceptable that the prime minister had knowledge that this overspend had occurred and he hasn\u2019t come forward with this evidence,\u201d said Lucas, who recently announced he would stand down at the next general election. \u201cWhat\u2019s quite clear is Cummings, Johnson and Gove are absolutely in this up to their necks. They must now come clean about everything they knew about these offences. Boris Johnson is simply not fit to be prime minister. He clearly has no respect for the law,\u201d Lucas said. Gavin Millar QC of Matrix Chambers said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got two very senior politicians in positions of great responsibility and they have never been required to give an account of what they knew. In the US they would have been hauled in front of a committee.\u201d The development arrives at a particularly delicate period for Johnson and Cummings with fresh pressure on Downing Street yesterday to release a potentially incendiary report into the extent of Russian interference in British politics. Jeremy Corbyn accused Downing Street of delaying the report, which examined allegations that Kremlin-sponsored activity distorted the result of the 2016 EU referendum, asking Downing Street what the government \u201chave got to hide\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
