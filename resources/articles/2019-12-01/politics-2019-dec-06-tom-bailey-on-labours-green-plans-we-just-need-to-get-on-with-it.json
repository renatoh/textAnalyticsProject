One of the key architects behind Labour\u2019s plan for a green industrial revolution, Bailey wants to make clear that the work to which he and a team of academics, engineers and economists have dedicated their spare time over the past 18 months is \u201ca no-brainer\u201d. \u201cMost of this stuff was already out there,\u201d says the 35-year-old. \u201cIf we had written this 10 or 15 years ago it would have looked very similar. The curves on the graphs would be slightly less steep because at that stage we had not wasted a decade or more. Now we just need to get on with it.\u201d For many climate scientists, the action that politicians take \u2013 or fail to take \u2013 in the next 10 years will decide humanity\u2019s fate. This has left many normally cautious experts \u2013 and a growing number of ordinary people, from schoolchildren to pensioners \u2013 frustrated and terrified by the lack of serious political engagement with the climate emergency. But while other topics, from Brexit to the NHS, have often dominated the election debate, there are signs \u2013 from hunger-striking climate activists camped outside party HQs, to the world\u2019s first televised leaders\u2019 debate on the ecological crisis \u2013 that the issue is starting to cut through. Bailey believes Labour, at least, has understood the existential challenge facing humanity. \u201cWe have been waiting for a mainstream political party to look this in the face and realise what is needed, and this is exactly what we have got with this plan. This is enough to stop climate change from an energy point of view. It is that simple.\u201d Labour\u2019s offer on the environment is certainly a key part of its bid to win office on 12 December. Its framing of a green industrial revolution is central to its transformative programme and would, it says, fix the economy, cut carbon emissions and create 1m well-paid green jobs. But it is not the only party to give prominence to the crisis. An analysis of the parties\u2019 manifestos by Greenpeace found that the Green party had the best offer on the climate, scoring 19 out of 20, with Labour on 16, the Lib Dems on 15 and the Tories just seven. Bailey says the key difference in Labour\u2019s plan is that it ties radical environmental action to a worker-led \u201cjust transition\u201d, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by and benefits ordinary people. The manifesto makes no hard commitment to reaching zero carbon by 2030. This was seized on as evidence that, under pressure from trade unions, Labour\u2019s final offer lacks real teeth. But grassroots groups such as Momentum and Labour for Green New Deal, which have been pushing a radical green agenda within the party for months, welcomed the party\u2019s commitment to transform the economy and the pledge to achieve the \u201csubstantial majority\u201d of emissions reductions by 2030. Bailey, the lead author of Labour\u2019s plan to decarbonise the UK\u2019s energy sector, which has been adopted wholesale in the party\u2019s manifesto, is adamant the offer is \u201chugely transformational \u2026 and would mean changes for every person, every building, every piece of infrastructure, every institution. \u201cIt would put UK energy supply and use \u2013 which is the source for a majority of UK emissions \u2013 more than in line with what the scientists say is necessary to keep warming below 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels]. In fact, it goes even further than is required by the science, putting the UK in a global leadership position and allowing developing countries space to transition equitably.\u201d Bailey got a master\u2019s in sustainable engineering from Imperial College in London before spending a decade working in the green energy sector in the UK, US and China. In his current day job (all the work for Labour has been strictly in his spare time), Bailey works for C40, an organisation that brings together almost 100 of the world\u2019s leading cities to help coordinate action on the climate emergency. When he began work 13 years ago, he was hopeful about politicians\u2019 determination to tackle the climate crisis. \u201cThat was a time when there was huge optimism, it felt like we had this massive issue of climate change, which was undoubtedly really scary but actually it felt like everyone realised the scale of this and were beginning to act accordingly.\u201d He says the introduction of the Climate Change Act, the Stern review and \u201clots of detailed discussion about the policies that were needed\u201d left him and others in the sector confident that the political class had the crisis in hand. So he went into the private sector with the aim of rolling out the policies and technologies to avoid a catastrophic climate breakdown. What happened next left him despondent. He says that after the 2008 financial crash, the political class backed away from taking the necessary measures. Depressed about the level of debate and action in the UK after 2010, Bailey left to work overseas, returning just before the 2017 election. \u201cWhen I got back I read Labour\u2019s manifesto and was really impressed with its ambition. I remember being genuinely excited. Then to see that sort of ambition do pretty well in an election felt like a real moment \u2013 something we collectively had a duty to get behind.\u201d Shortly after the vote he contacted party officials and asked if they needed any help \u201cdeepening the technical side of their policies\u201d. Labour took him up on the offer and within weeks Bailey was pulling together a team of interdisciplinary experts \u2013 economists, engineers, regulators, academics and technicians \u2013 who all gave their time for free. \u201cThere was no hesitation at all from the people I approached. We are all energy and climate professionals in our 20s or 30s, millennials, who have really lived with this issue in our personal and professional lives. They know the facts around what we are facing, know the answers and see this as our last best chance to change course.\u201d The fruits of the group\u2019s work were laid out in a 185-page report \u2013 Thirty by 2030 \u2013 released with little fanfare in October. The recommendations are now official party policy. Among the report\u2019s highlights are plans by 2030 to: Upgrade every home, public, commercial and industrial building in the UK with insulation and double-glazing, focusing on poor damp homes and areas of fuel poverty first. Fully decarbonise 90% of electricity through a \u201chuge and immediate\u201d expansion in renewables, including 7,000 new offshore wind turbines, 2,000 new onshore wind turbines and enough new solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches. Decarbonise 50% of UK heat with solutions such as the installation of 8m heat pumps. Although the initial investment would be huge \u2013 in the hundreds of billions \u2013 the report says the programme would boost the UK economy by \u00a3800bn by 2030, create 1m jobs, leave householders better off and save at least 6,000 lives by drastically improving air quality across the UK. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has criticised some of Labour\u2019s plans, has not questioned the details of its green new deal programme although its director, Paul Johnson, said it would be difficult to deliver the \u201cscale of increase in capital spending \u2026 at least in the near term.\u201d Bailey says the sums underpinning the plan were done by a \u201cworld-leading team\u201d at Leeds University, and the final version was sent out to academics and policy experts who reviewed the findings and gave feedback before endorsing the proposals as \u201cthe upper limit of feasibility, but appropriate to the climate emergency we find ourselves in\u201d. He says there has been little or no opposition to the plans from regulators, technical experts, economists, academics or unions, mainly because \u201cfor those who have been paying attention to the unfolding climate disaster, the solutions have been clear for years. There is such clarity about what the next steps are, and this is what has led to so much frustration. We could have done this a decade ago.\u201d Next year the UK hosts the UN climate summit, and whoever is leading the UK government will have a unique opportunity to shape how the world responds to the crisis. Bailey says no one should be in any doubt about what is at stake when they go to the polling booths next week. \u201cThis is our last chance to start acting on this. It is the make-or-break moment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
