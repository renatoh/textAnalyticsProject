Labour\u2019s leaked manifesto draft, published on Wednesday night, said the party would place \u201cpeace, universal rights and international law\u201d at the heart of foreign policy, while committing to spend the Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence and to maintaining the Trident nuclear deterrent. On Friday, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is set to give a major foreign policy speech where he will declare \u201cI am not a pacifist\u201d, but say military intervention has become \u201calmost routine in recent times\u201d. Foreign policy has long been one of his personal priorities, especially support for unilateral disarmament and Palestinian rights. Thornberry said it was \u201cnot too late to do Robin\u2019s legacy proud\u201d and reset the UK\u2019s diplomatic course, adding: \u201cLike Robin, we will put human rights back at the heart of Britain\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d She highlighted plans to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia until after a UN investigation into alleged war crimes in Yemen, to review all UK contracts with repressive regimes such as Bahrain and a pledge to stand up to countries including China, Turkey and Egypt on human rights. In Cook\u2019s speech to Foreign Office staff, the then foreign secretary said he would \u201cmake Britain once again a force for good in the world\u201d and pledged arms control measures and a focus on human rights and the environment. \u201cThe Labour government does not accept that political values can be left behind when we check in our passports to travel on diplomatic business,\u201d Cook said in 1997. \u201cOur foreign policy must have an ethical dimension and must support the demands of other peoples for the democratic rights on which we insist for ourselves.\u201d In early 2003, by then leader of the House of Commons, he resigned from the cabinet over the proposed military action in Iraq. In a pointed attack on Theresa May, which also serves to underline Corbyn\u2019s difference over Iraq with Tony Blair\u2019s government, Thornberry criticised May\u2019s decision not to accept the Iraq war was a mistake. \u201cFour times she refused to do so,\u201d Thornberry said. \u201cIf she wins on 8 June, as a fresh act of devotion to Donald Trump, Theresa May will call an immediate vote to authorise military action against the Syrian government,\u201d she went on. \u201cWhere Robin Cook came out of the 1997 election wanting \u2018to secure the respect of other nations for Britain\u2019s contribution to keeping the peace of the world\u2019, Theresa May goes into this election already planning a unilateral act of war.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s Labour government would sever the close relationship cultivated by May with the US government, Thornberry said. \u201cFrom day one, we will stand up to his administration, making clear that the special relationship with America is based above all on shared values and that if Trump continues to ignore and abuse those values, we will criticise him openly, as we would do any other leader,\u201d she said. In his speech to Chatham House in London, Corbyn is to say: \u201cWaiting to see which way the wind blows in Washington isn\u2019t strong leadership. And pandering to an erratic Trump administration will not deliver stability.\u201d He will say military action, under international law and as a genuine last resort, \u201cis in some circumstances necessary\u201d but that the \u201c\u2018bomb first, talk later\u2019 approach to security\u201d has failed. \u201cSo no more hand-holding with Donald Trump; a Labour government will conduct a robust and independent foreign policy made in London,\u201d Corbyn will say. \u201cThis is the fourth general election in a row to be held while Britain is at war and our armed forces are in action in the Middle East and beyond. The \u2018war on terror\u2019 which lies behind these interventions has failed. They have not increased our security at home \u2013 rather the opposite \u2013 and they have caused destabilisation and devastation abroad.\u201d The former cabinet minister Peter Hain, who served in the Foreign Office with Cook, said he backed the foreign policy rethink in the draft manifesto, especially policies on arms sales. \u201cThis government has watered down the arms control legislation that we introduced, which I as a Foreign Office minister drove forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a tightening of that would be welcome. An ethical foreign policy is popular.\u201d Hain said there was much more to admire in the manifesto beyond foreign policy, including the commitments to affordable housing, elderly social care and investment in the NHS. \u201cThey are common sense popular policies,\u201d he said. \u201cI fought the 1983 election as a Labour candidate, it\u2019s nothing like that. That was unilateral nuclear disarmament, this isn\u2019t. It\u2019s got practical policies that will chime with voters.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
