A pair of surfers from Cornwall and Northern Ireland this week became the first Britons to be recognised by the Oscars of big wave surfing - the XXL Big Wave awards. Now the world's elite surfers believe Britain and Ireland could be a new frontier in their bid to conquest the \"unridden realm\" of giant waves. Duncan Scott, 29, and Alistair Mennie, 27, were nominated for Ride of the Year after surfing waves as high as 60ft at Mullaghmore Head, Co Sligo - the biggest recorded by Ireland's Marine Institute. Greg Long, a 24-year old Californian who has surfed the biggest waves in the world over the past two years, will next month join Britain's small group of \"heavy water pioneers\" and catch the roaring low pressure systems which have created conditions this winter to rank alongside legendary big waves such as Teahupoo in Tahiti and the shark-infested Dungeons in South Africa. The only difference for big wave surfers in Britain and Ireland is they might have to scrape ice off their board and endure wind chills as cold as -9c before paddling out. Scott, who is also president of the British Surfing Association, and his team of fellow big wave adventurers are planning to tackle an unridden 30ft break known as Zorba's off Newquay Bay in Cornwall and another close to Sennen lighthouse, near Land's End, but the biggest waves are found off Ireland where the Atlantic rolls in undisturbed by the continental shelf. An early British big wave surfer, Ted Deerhurst, said it is like \"jumping off a three-storey house, and then having the house chase you down the street\". If a surfer falls he - it is almost entirely a male pursuit - can be held down beneath the churning ocean for as long as 40 seconds and pounded against rocks. One of the sport's pioneers, Mark Foo, drowned attempting to surf Maverick's, a fearsome cold water break off northern California in 1994. Others have perished since. This week Scott was researching big wave spots in South Africa as part of plans for \"an endless winter\" chasing giant swells. He described wiping out - falling off the board: \"You curl up in a ball and cover your face as the whole of the ocean churns over you. You go to your 'happy place' and try and relax and not panic.\" It is estimated that there are little more than a dozen surfers in Britain and Ireland with the experience and training to tackle a sport that its proponents say has more in common with mountaineering than the gentle body boarding attempted by holidaymakers. Mennie, and his fellow surfers at Mullaghmore Head in Ireland, have long known about the potential of the north and westerly-facing coastlines of the UK and Ireland. \"Now, with a concerted focus on finding and riding these waves, backed up by jetski technology and our own surfing experience and training, we're riding waves that we could only have dreamt about in the past,\" he said. Bill Sharp, director of the XXL Big Wave awards, based in California, said Britain and Ireland \"are getting some of the most incredible waves we have ever seen coming out of Europe\". The BSA estimates there are more than half a million regular surfers in the UK who crowd the breaks in Devon, Cornwall, west Wales and northern Scotland. But few will graduate to riding giants. Those that take it on treat it as a profession, poring over bathymetric charts and swell forecasts on computer screens. Technology allowed Long and his colleagues to surf waves last month which could soon be verified as 80ft, the tallest ever ridden. His team discovered there was a four-hour window between two storms in which they could surf Cortes Bank, a cauldron of breaks 100 miles out to sea off California. \"That day was like climbing Everest,\" said Long. \"When we sat down afterwards it was incredibly emotional. Being in the ocean and co-existing with those mountains exposed me to a whole new level of feelings.\" In the waves: Duncan Scott I float alongside my surfboard in the water, waiting while my partner Alistair stands astride the jetski and looks out to sea for the next set of giant waves. The horizon seems to lift and darken. Alistair accelerates and I tighten my grip on the towrope until we're up and charging towards the approaching liquid mountains. There are three, evenly spaced and each larger than the next. We let the first two pass unridden, and chase down the final, largest wave. I use the tension of the towrope to slingshot myself on to the peaking swell. I let go of my umbilical safety cord and with my intense focus and tunnel vision I can hear nothing. All that matters is riding a fine line between critical and terminal. The wave rears to its full, angry height and suddenly I am concerned to see that I'm very far behind the collapsing section teetering 55 feet overhead. So I lean into my bottom turn, project all the distance I can from my straining thighs to try to outrun the avalanche. I've made it. The wave detonates just a few feet behind me and the compressed air inside the barrel of the wave \"spits\" me forwards on to the wave's shoulder and I glide out into the safety of the channel. I'm hooting with exhilaration with the realisation that I've ridden one of the biggest barrels documented in Britain and Ireland. Al swoops in on the jetski and we swap roles. As the next set of waves approach, I drive him into position for the ride of his life. \u00b7 Duncan Scott and Alistair Mennie have been nominated for XXL Big Wave awards \u00b7 This article was amended on Monday February 25 2008.
