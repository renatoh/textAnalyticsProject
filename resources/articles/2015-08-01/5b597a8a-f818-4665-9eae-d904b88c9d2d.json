Across England and Wales the annual summer drop was more muted than at any time since the credit crunch, said Rightmove. New sellers entering the market during the past month are asking an average of 0.8% less for their homes than those who put homes up for sale in July. But this compares with a typical August decline of 1.5%. The latest figures showed a north-south divide in buyer confidence, with new sellers in London and the rest of the south asking less for homes than those coming to market in July, while those in the north of England and in Wales had higher hopes. In Greater London, the drop was 1.3% to an average asking price of \u00a3606,826, and other parts of the south all saw falls of more than 1%. The biggest increase was in the north-east, where new sellers asked 1.2% more than in July, at an average of \u00a3149,051. In contrast, in the east Midlands, asking prices dropped by 1.4% to an average of \u00a3187,587. Rightmove said the national average asking price was now \u00a3292,284, just \u00a3258 less than in July. It said the smallest August fall since 2007 was a result of the ongoing mismatch between demand from buyers and the supply of homes on the market. This month, the number of properties coming on to the market is down by 8% on the same period last year. Rightmove said its research among sellers found the main reason they were holding off selling was they could not find anywhere to buy, confirming fears expressed by surveyors on Thursday of a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d, where homeowners are put off selling because there was nowhere to buy. That was the reason put forward by one in five respondents to Rightmove\u2019s survey, while a similar number were deterred by the cost of moving and 15% said they could not find an affordable property. One in 10 said they were waiting for house prices to increase in their area before they sold up. Miles Shipside, Rightmove director, said: \u201cWhile new seller asking prices have been muted by the traditional summer holiday property slowdown, the underlying shortage of property coming to market compared to buyer demand has helped to deliver the strongest August price performance since before the credit crunch. \u201cBuyers can normally pick up some bargains in August as sellers who are marketing their homes when they should be holidaying often have a pressing need to sell and mark their prices down pretty aggressively. At 0.8% down on the previous month, this is the least generous that sellers have had to be for eight years and a clear sign of upwards price pressure in the pipeline.\u201d Meanwhile, figures from the broker Mortgage Advice Bureau (MAB) suggest rising house prices and new affordability tests by lenders are encouraging borrowers to apply for loans over longer periods. It said one in five homebuyers looked for a mortgage lasting 30 years or longer in the second quarter of the year, double the proportion a year earlier. By taking out a home loan over a longer period, borrowers are able to reduce their monthly repayments and pass affordability checks introduced in spring 2014. But while they reduce their monthly costs, the overall price of borrowing is much higher. MAB said on a typical \u00a3151,668 mortgage taken on a two-year fixed rate of 1.87%, borrowers arranging the loan over 25 years would face monthly repayments of \u00a3634. Over a 30-year period they would fall to \u00a3551 and over 35 years they would decline to \u00a3493. Over the course of the mortgage, however, the 35-year term would cost almost \u00a350,000 more in interest payments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
