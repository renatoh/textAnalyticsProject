Morgan, the club captain, signed a new three-year contract until 2019 with the Premier League champions on Tuesday. Mahrez\u2019s future is yet to be resolved, with the Algeria winger\u2019s agent, Kamel Bengougam, suggesting last week the player is keen to leave . Mahrez, the PFA player of the year, scored 17 goals and assisted with another 11 as Leicester completed a remarkable title triumph and his departure would be a blow to Claudio Ranieri, who has already had the influential midfielder N\u2019golo Kant\u00e9 join Chelsea. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of talking going off but hopefully everybody can follow in my footsteps,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe want to maintain our key players and build on that with the new players because we have got a lot to play for this season. We have some fantastic players and some of the bigger teams in Europe are going to want them. We need to focus on our job, let the people talk the talk and do what we can do on the pitch. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s to be expected especially after the season we had and I suppose teams trying to poach our better players is part and parcel of the job.\u201d Ranieri said after the pre-season match against Oxford United on Tuesday that Mahrez would not join Kant\u00e9 in leaving. \u201cEverybody here is happy and he [Mahrez] wants to stay. No other players will go away \u2013 we will stay together,\u201d the manager said. Leicester play Celtic on Saturday in the International Champions Cup, before taking on Paris Saint-Germain in California a week later. The summer signings Ron-Robert Zieler, Luis Hern\u00e1ndez and Ahmed Musa will all travel after coming on as second-half substitutes against Oxford. The midfielder Nampalys Mendy, who was absent from Leicester\u2019s first friendly of the summer, is expected to play some part against Celtic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
