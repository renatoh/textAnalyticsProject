He said the contract was null and void as EE had been bought by BT, and persuaded me to sign a contract costing \u00a310 a month more than EE. I then discovered my EE contract was live and I would have to pay a \u00a3118 early termination fee. EE has been excellent and waived it, but when I rang Virgin to ask about its complaints procedure, I was kept on hold so long I used \u00a320 credit on my phone. As a pensioner, I can\u2019t afford multiples of \u00a320, so I\u2019ve had to let the matter rest there. DH, Lichfield This appears to be an unpleasant example of a salesman taking advantage of an older customer. You were sold a 12-month contract for 50Mb broadband and telephone and, after investigating at my behest, Virgin discovered you were also signed up to a \u00a36 sim-only deal on the same day. You say you have no idea what a sim deal is. Virgin says it has no record of your conversation with the salesman so can\u2019t verify the details, but as a goodwill gesture it will apply a retrospective \u00a310-a-month discount to your bill to match your deal with EE and refund the money you have paid for the sim. It adds: \u201cWe apologise for the confusion and as a gesture of goodwill have applied a further discount to the account so he\u2019s now paying less than EE\u2019s cheapest broadband package.\u201d Be wary of signing any contract if cold-called by phone or in person.
