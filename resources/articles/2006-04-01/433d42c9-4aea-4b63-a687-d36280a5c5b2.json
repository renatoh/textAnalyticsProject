Not any more. The rapid - albeit long-delayed - roll out of broadband is changing the face of commerce and entertainment, unleashing a wave of creative potential across the world. It is even possible to view the past seven days as the tipping point for a new era. Last week, Hollywood film studios, after resisting the forces of change for so long, started to allow consumers to download films from the internet on the same day as the release of DVDs (which make up most of Hollywood's profits) instead of up to 60 days later. Put that within the context of what is happening to TVs and monitors - they are becoming bigger, flatter and capable of high definition images - and it may not be long before films have their premieres simultaneously in millions of living rooms. It may also hasten last week's prediction by Jonathan Miller, chief of AOL, that the screen of preference for TV in future will \"probably be the internet\". That certainly appears to be the view of BT which last week threw off a decade of slow reaction to the potential of the internet by offering subscribers an ultra-fast download speed of 8Mb - four times faster than the current 2Mb - for no extra cost. This may not be unconnected to BT's planned expansion into delivering television through the net having been beaten to the start by much smaller firms such as HomeChoice. Last week also saw Gnarls Barkley's Crazy become the first chart-topper in the UK based on downloads alone - though there have to be hard copies available within a week to qualify for inclusion in the music industry's chart. Meanwhile, mainly in the US, there has been an explosion of activity related to people making their own videos (with digital cameras or even camera phones) and uploading them, at no cost, to any of dozens of new websites. The biggest of them, YouTube.com claims that 30m user-created videos are viewed every day. They vary from the banal to the unexpected as people let others see them making music, reading diaries, snapping celebrities, doing citizens' journalism or putting up five-minute films, often in serial form. This follows the big success of Flickr.com, enabling photographs to be shared globally, and MySpace.com (now thought to have been purchased cheaply by Rupert Murdoch at $580m) in enabling millions of youngsters around the world to communicate about anything and create music. Both websites have spawned imitators including Faceparty.com, with a claimed 6 million members, and Bebo.com to which up to 4.5 million people in Britain have joined since its launch last year. Yet another one, started by Harvard drop-outs, is providing similar social networking to universities. Inevitably, this unprecedented explosion of social networking has brought in its wake fears about pornography and the ease with which perverts might make contact with youngsters through their personal websites. The better sites are already taking action - though not enough - to curtail such abuses if only because they know there will be pressure to shut them down if they do not. But this should not blind anyone to the astonishing world-wide phenomenon that is taking place in which anyone can communicate with another like-minded soul and consumers have suddenly been enabled to become producers. It is possible there will be a disintermediation of entertainment in which a new generation of people who write books, make films, music, poems, art or whatever can publish - or sell - their output directly to people who want it. This prospect has been opened by the expansion of broadband and the plumetting cost of data storage (enabling the websites to store almost unlimited videos and films without charging). Technology and creativity are marching hand in hand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
