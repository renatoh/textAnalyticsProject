On Wednesday, the President of the United States warned her not to \u201cdisrespect\u201d her country. Rapinoe, who has won the World Cup and Olympics with the USWNT, is outspoken on social issues and was the first white professional athlete to kneel for the national anthem in protest of social injustice in the United States, before US Soccer passed a rule requiring team members to stand for the anthem. In a video that has circulated on social media since Tuesday \u2013 but appears to have been filmed before the World Cup started \u2013 she said that she would not visit the White House if the team wins the tournament. On Wednesday, Trump responded to Rapinoe\u2019s comments, although he addressed Twitter user @meganrapino rather than Rapinoe\u2019s official account @mPinoe before correcting it about an hour later. \u201cWomen\u2019s soccer player, @meganrapino, just stated that she is \u201cnot going to the F...ing White House if we win.\u201d Other than the NBA, which now refuses to call owners, owners (please explain that I just got Criminal Justice Reform passed, Black unemployment is at the lowest level... ....in our Country\u2019s history, and the poverty index is also best number EVER), leagues and teams love coming to the White House. I am a big fan of the American Team, and Women\u2019s Soccer, but Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! \u201cFinish the job! We haven\u2019t yet........invited Megan or the team, but I am now inviting the TEAM, win or lose. Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her &amp; the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!\u201d If the US do refuse a visit to the White House, they would be following in the footsteps of the Golden State Warriors, who did not meet with the President after winning the NBA championship, and the Philadelphia Eagles, who skipped the trip after winning Super Bowl LII. Other US championship teams have visited Trump although some players on nearly every one of those teams have chosen to stay away. Rapinoe\u2019s teammates Becky Sauerbrunn and Alex Morgan have also said that they will not attend the White House should the team win the World Cup. The US met with Barack Obama after they won the World Cup in 2015. Veteran fullback Ali Krieger, who is engaged to teammate Ashlyn Harris, voiced her support for Rapinoe on Wednesday, saying that she would also decline a White House visit and doesn\u2019t \u201csupport this administration nor their fight against LGBTQ+ citizens, immigrants &amp; our most vulnerable\u201d. Trump\u2019s remarks came one day after he said he did not think it was appropriate for Rapinoe, a co-captain of the US team, to protest during the anthem during an interview with The Hill. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said when asked about Rapinoe\u2019s actions. The 33-year-old Rapinoe has been outspoken about LGBTQ rights as well as racial and gender equality. She is also one of the most prominent voices in the US team\u2019s battle with their federation over equal pay. \u201cThe more I\u2019ve been able to learn about gay rights and equal pay and gender equity and racial inequality, the more that it all intersects,\u201d Rapinoe told the Guardian in 2017. \u201cYou can\u2019t really pick it apart. It\u2019s all intertwined. God forbid you be a gay woman and a person of color in this country, because you\u2019d be really fucked. \u201cAs I got more into gay rights, I got more into equal pay and you just see that it\u2019s all connected. You can\u2019t really speak out on one thing and not another without it not being the full picture. We need to talk about a larger conversation in this country about equality in general and respect \u2013 especially with the recent election and subsequent narrative that\u2019s coming from the White House right now.\u201d The US play hosts France on Friday for a place in the World Cup semi-finals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
