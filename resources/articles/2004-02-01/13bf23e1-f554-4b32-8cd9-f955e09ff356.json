I would be very, very surprised if Aberdeen or Dunfermline could offer him any better than what we could.\" \u00b7A minute's silence will be observed before this weekend's Tennent's Scottish Cup matches in honour of the former Scotland manager Ally MacLeod."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
