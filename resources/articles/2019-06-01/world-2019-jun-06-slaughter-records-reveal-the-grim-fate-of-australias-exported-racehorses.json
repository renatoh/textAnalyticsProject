A further 11% are listed in the Korean Racing Authority (KRA) records as \u201cundecided\u201d, an entry that often coincides with an abrupt end to their medical history, or the listing of an injury that is incompatible with racing. It follows the publication by Guardian Australia of footage secretly recorded by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) at one of the main horse abattoirs at Nonghyup on Jeju Island in South Korea, which showed horses being beaten on the head with plastic pipes before being chased into the abattoir. That video included footage of three Australian-bred racehorses, including Dynamic Tank, sired by Kentucky Derby winner Big Brown. Bareal Jeong, an Australian-bred racehorse sired by Street Cry, father of champion Australian racehorse Winx, was listed in a 40-year audit of slaughter records conducted by the KRA in 2015. He is likely to have been slaughtered in 2010, when his veterinary records end. An analysis of Australian Stud Book and KRA records shows that of the 190 horses exported from Australia to South Korea between January 2013 and May 2019, 22 are listed as having been sent to slaughter and 29 are listed as having died, with most of those deaths believed to also be connected to the meat industry. A further 11 died as a result of an accident during a race or in training, or because of an illness such as colic. About 27% \u2014 or 53 horses \u2014 were still racing, with that figure weighted toward the horses which had been more recently exported. Thirteen horses had been moved into the breeding industry, and 40, or 21%, had been retired as riding horses. The average time between the listed date of export from Australia and the date a horse was reported to have died, or become \u201cundecided\u201d, is 22 months. The RSPCA\u2019s chief scientist, Bidda Jones, said the footage showed there were \u201cobvious problems that need to be fixed\u201d if Australia is to continue exporting thoroughbreds. \u201cWe would urge Racing Australia to work closely with its overseas counterparts to ensure the humane handling of Australians racehorses throughout their lives, whether here or overseas,\u201d Jones said. She said she the story received \u201cthousands of angry reactions and responses\u201d within an hour of being shared on the RSPCA\u2019s Facebook page on Thursday. \u201cAustralians will not tolerate violence and cruelty toward animals,\u201d she said. Jones compared the reaction to responses to the live sheep export trade, which was heavily restricted following the release last year of whistleblower footage showing inhumane conditions, and said the racing industry had failed to act when faced with community opposition over issues like the use of whips. \u201cIn this day and age, there is nowhere to hide,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the animals in your care aren\u2019t being treated well, when that\u2019s happening, wherever it\u2019s happening, you will be found out.\u201d Jones said industries that relied on animals should address these issues \u201clong before they\u2019re exposed in a national media story\u201d. Racing Australia was shown footage from the abattoir on Tuesday but said it would not expand on an earlier statement on horse retirement protocols introduced in Australia in 2015, which also expressed its support for the establishment of a government-funded national horse traceability register. It did not respond to a further request for comment on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
