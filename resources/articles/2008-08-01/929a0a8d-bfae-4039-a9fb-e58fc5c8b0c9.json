According to the Halifax, just over a quarter of the privately-owned homes in the UK, more than 5.5m, were valued above \u00a3250,000 at the end of last year, the threshold at which stamp duty is levied at 3% of the property's value. In 2002, there were just 1.8m properties valued above \u00a3250,000. A family buying the average-priced home in Greater London, currently \u00a3291,500, would pay the Treasury \u00a38,745 in tax. The government has enjoyed a large increase in revenue from stamp duty since Labour came to power in 1997. That year, the yield from residential properties was just \u00a3675m. Increases in the rate of tax combined with the impact of rising house prices meant the Treasury collected \u00a36.4bn from stamp duty on homes last year. However, that figure will fall dramatically this year as the housing market has hit a wall and the number of transactions has plummeted to record lows. Under the current regime, there are four stamp duty bands. Buyers of homes worth less than \u00a3125,000 pay nothing. Between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a3250,000, buyers pay 1% on the price of the home; between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000, buyers pay 3% of the price; and above \u00a3500,000, they pay 4%. There were 1m properties in the UK valued at more than \u00a3500,000 at the end of last year, a threefold increase in the past five years, according to the Halifax. Consumer groups, mortgage lenders and house builders have lobbied for the lifting of the current thresholds to keep them in line with rising house prices, and those calls have become louder as the housing market has been paralysed by the credit crunch. First-time buyers are under particular pressure as the banks' lending criteria have become tougher and they are being forced to find much larger deposits. If the higher stamp duty thresholds of \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000 had increased in line with house price inflation since July 1997 when they were introduced, they would now stand at \u00a3720,000 and \u00a31.44m, the Halifax said. If the chancellor goes ahead with either a deferment or tax holiday, it would not be the first time that stamp duty has been temporarily suspended to get the housing market moving again and, opponents might suggest, to score political points during desperate times. Stamp duty on properties under \u00a3250,000 was suspended temporarily for nine months in 1991-92 by the Conservative chancellor Norman Lamont in an attempt to thaw out the housing market ahead of the general election. Under the Conservatives, there was a flat rate of 1% in stamp duty, payable on properties valued at more than \u00a360,000. Economists and industry bodies suggested that a stamp duty holiday would help the housing market but stressed that additional measures were still needed. Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight, said any temporary scrapping or deferment of the tax would have only a \"limited\" impact on the housing market. \"The problems relating to affordability and tight lending conditions run pretty deep,\" he said. \"Probably the main help it would provide is in helping first-time buyers coming up with the deposit they need to buy a house.\" He also questioned the impact on government finances. \"They are in such a mess at the moment, you wonder if they can afford it,\" he said. A spokesman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders welcomed a possible reform of the tax. \"In a weakening housing market, stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first-time buyers and the wider housing market.\" But he said the move failed to address the lack of mortgage financing available. \"Removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence, not the wider problems in the financial markets.\" A recent analysis by the Halifax illustrates the increasing burden of stamp duty on home buyers. Across the UK, home buyers last year paid average stamp duty of \u00a31,971, representing 7% of average full time earnings. In 2002, the average stamp duty bill was \u00a31,211, the equivalent of 5% of earnings in that year. In 2000, the government raised the rate of tax for the \u00a3250,000-plus band from 1.5% to the current 3%, while for the \u00a3500,000-plus threshold, the levy was doubled from 2% to 4%. The Treasury has moved to ease the burden on lower-income families, raising the lowest level of stamp duty from \u00a360,000 to \u00a3120,000 in the 2005 budget. The threshold was raised again to \u00a3125,000 a year later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
