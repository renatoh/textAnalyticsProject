First, the cost of living will bring a smile to even the most-budget conscious traveller's face. Second, the people are welcoming. Third, despite the enormous beauty of the country, international tourism is still in its infancy. Add in a good climate and fantastic food and wine, and you'll realise that this is a great place to visit. It was to learn more about wine tourism that I recently travelled to Mendoza - the wine-growing heart of Argentina. With over 180,000 acres under cultivation, producing 1.3 million tonnes of grapes, this is the home of familiar brands including Argento, Norton and Santa Julia - they all come from Mendoza's 16 wine-producing departments. No surprise here, perhaps: the region is roughly the same distance from the Equator as the premier grape-growing regions of France, Italy and California. As you drive to the vineyards, though, you begin to wonder if it's all some sort of trick. How can this lunar landscape produce wine, still less a fifth of the world total? (My guide confirmed that the area was indeed a geographical desert.) But I was instructed to look up for the answer - 6000 metres skywards, to be precise, towards the towering Andes that dominate the skyline. Mendoza sits in the run-off of these formidable mountains, which makes the soil rich and fertile, and by using a sophisticated irrigation system Mendozan growers engineer the quantity of water to produce just the right balance of sugars in the grape. It's worth going to Mendoza just for the joy of drinking Malbec - a magnificent wine from a grape that originated in Bordeaux but is now virtually unique to Argentina. It produces a beautiful, spicy, dark-red drink that perfectly complements the succulent steaks and barbecue grills you find served across the country. Another incentive is that, unlike in South Africa, California or France, in Mendoza you don't feel like a tourist. No group-organised tours here; no follow-the-guide, have a quick slurp and buy your souvenirs on the way out. Instead you're shown round individually, no appointment needed. The vineyard-owning families are only too pleased to practise their English, and their welcome seems utterly genuine. At the winery of the Familia Zuccardi I was treated to a horseback tour of the 4000-acre estancia by the vineyard manager, who talked in loving detail about the wine-growing process. I was then taken back to the workers' kitchen, where the elderly grandmother offered me bread and home-cured ham before we started the serious business of tasting. No spittoons were offered and it seemed impolite not to swallow (after all, everyone else did). How we managed to get through seven bottles before dinner with only four of us quaffing, I don't know - but they're a hardy bunch, the Argentinians. The visit to Bodega Salentein in the Valle de Uco in the south-west of Mendoza was equally fascinating. With the help of a \u00a350-million investment this winery has built what is essentially a large hole in the ground. It's a hole with a purpose, though, because it allows the grapes to be fed into the machinery from above, and so, with the help of gravity, there is less chance for them being bruised. In common with a few other wineries, this Bodega runs a guest house. Posada Salentein is set in woodland and offers trekking, fishing and four-wheel drives or horse rides into the mountains. I thoroughly enjoyed my evening's stay there: facilities were comfortable and the on-site cook and kitchen assistant rustled up an excellent dinner. And of course the wine flowed liberally. One of the finest Malbecs I tried came from the Catena vineyard, which dates back to 1902. Its owner, Nicolas Catena, is another wine pioneer. A native of Mendoza, Catena, a lecturer in economics and third-generation vineyard owner, decided a few years ago to build a new winery to produce premium-quality products, mainly for export. But he also wanted his building to make an architectural statement, employing Pablo S\u00e1nchez El\u00eda to create a structure in the style of Mayan temple. The spectacular result opened in 2001. Mendoza itself is a curious place. It's a haphazard and impoverished city (the earthquake of 1985 didn't help matters), but its teeming markets and bars seem more truly authentic than the sophisticated Parisian boulevards of Buenos Aires. Clubs with swarthy bouncers are ubiquitous, and the drinks are cheap, the (Spanish) music loud, and the student crowd is friendly - don't expect any action before 2.30am, though. One good option is La Guanaca on Chacras de Coria. And Mendoza also boasts one of Argentina's best restaurants - testament to the number of businessmen who travel to the heart of the wine industry. Not many locals eat in Francis Mallmann's 1884 Restaurant (located on Belgrano 1188), but that shouldn't deter you. The food is exceptional and the wine-matching, not surprisingly, is as good as it gets. Dinner for two costs approximately \u00a340 with booze. Actual \"sights\" are few and far between, but the large and impressive General San Martin Park is worth a stroll, boasting an ornate monument commemorating San Martin's crossing of the Andes during his fight to liberate Argentina, Chile and Peru from the Spanish. There's also an excellent zoo here, where you can watch wild animals scampering around in what appears to be a remarkably natural habitat. The best shopping is located in Avenidas Las Heras, which, as well as the usual tacky souvenirs, offers some seriously good leather goods. But you're most likely to come here for the wine, and the museum at the Giol winery in the Maip\u00fa district, near the city, offers plenty to see. At the moment, too, there's lots going on - the Fiesta de la Vendimia, the annual wine festival, takes place on the first Saturday in March. It's held in the amphitheatre of the San Martin park, and the celebrations include folkloric festivals and religious ceremonies to bless the grapes. And, with true Argentinian enthusiasm, the festivities begin several weeks before and continue long afterwards. Way to go Several airlines fly to Buenos Aires; Air France (0845 0845 111) offers return flights from Heathrow starting at approximately \u00a3500. The Buenos Aires to Mendoza flight costs around \u00a3150. For accommodation in Mendoza, the Princess Hotel (25 de Mayo 1168), costs around \u00a350 per night and is clean, comfortable and centrally located. It's bookable through Hotel Club; 0117 929 1752.
