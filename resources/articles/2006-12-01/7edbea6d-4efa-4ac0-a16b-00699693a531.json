But for all the huge social advances of the past 50 years, it is clear that some things have gone badly awry. We have become a less integrated society: more divided by class, income and geography. Inequalities persist, our lives are more fractured. The social fabric has been stretched, bruised and damaged. We prosper, economically, but we suffer, too, from a quiet crisis of unhappiness. Mutual support and neighbourliness have declined; isolation is increasing; mental illness is more prevalent than it was half a century ago; the signs of day-to-day anger and tension are everywhere. Yet this unhappiness is manifest more in depression than riots, in anxiety rather than insurrection, in public distrust rather than the channelled energy that makes social progress possible. Remaking these soft, often invisible social supports, so essential to the quality of our lives, is one of the great challenges of this century. Geoff Mulgan and Alessandra Buonfino on the flipside of social progress, January 18 A life in brown and white Louise and Claire are banging on the car roof within seconds. In the time I've been gone, no more than half-an-hour, they've earned \u00a380. \"Chappy,\" Louise commands. \"Quick time.\" We are going to Chapeltown, a largely African-Caribbean suburb of Leeds, to score their drugs. Heavy drugs are available anywhere in inner-city Leeds, but the very finest are to be found in Chapeltown. The girls are connoisseurs and accept nothing but the best. Louise requisitions my phone on the way and places her order. \"I want three brown and two white.\" We are soon parked on a back-street off Spencer Place. Ten minutes later, a young black kid on a BMX bike pulls up nearby in the darkness. Louise jumps out of the car and gets what she needs. \"Brown\" is heroin, \"white\" crack cocaine. She gets back in with five tiny wraps of what looks like greaseproof paper. \"Home, James,\" she orders, \"and don't spare the horses.\" Bernard Hare on his friend Louise, a drug addict and prostitute, January 25 Give us a break Jayne, a timid, girlish woman, has plucked up the courage to attend a pottery class, an arts group and a literacy course on which her community psychiatric nurse has enrolled her. David walks her to the class and picks her up. The two hours in between are the only time he ever has to relax. They are the only let-up from his tireless cycle of caring, cleaning and cooking. He has not had a night off for 18 years. \"Caring is seven days a week, 24 hours a day. I can't stress how difficult it is. You have to be on the ball all the time, sleeping with your eyes open.\" Alison Benjamin on a carer's life ,March 15 Anyone for porridge? It's a summer day on Bastoey island, and Magne Ramstad is making the most of it. Lying on his back in his shorts, the 38-year-old Norwegian is busy working on his tan. Around him is a beautiful Scandinavian landscape: lush woodland, bright-coloured houses and the sparkling waters of the Oslo fjord. For a prison, it's an idyllic setting. \"This place is unbelievable,\" says Ramstad, who is serving a six-year sentence for smuggling hashish. \"At the prison I was at before this one, we were locked up in our cells 23 hours a day.\" Glwadys Fouch\u00e9 on prison the Norwegian way , July 26 Fatal flaws Fifteen years ago, Will Powell saw his 10-year-old son die. Within days, he began to suspect that doctors who had looked after the boy had been negligent. He filed a complaint. Within months, he began to suspect that somebody was tampering with his son's medical records. He filed more complaints, and spent 15 years fighting for the truth. Now, finally, he has it - and he was right. During those 15 years, he turned for help to the state - to the coroner and the local health authority, then to the Welsh Office and the parliamentary ombudsman, to the local police, the Crown Prosecution Service and finally to an outside police force and the Independent Police Complaints Commission. They all let him down - guilty variously of indolence, indifference, cynicism, favouritism and sheer incompetence. Nick Davies on a tale of medical negligence and bureaucratic failure, January 4 Remembering Sophie When we arrived, there were two men standing beside a van outside our front door. Sophie was lying on the sofa with her eyes closed and hands neatly folded in front of her. There was no sign of disability and she reminded me of Sleeping Beauty. Then I wept, I wailed and I howled. I hugged her cold, waxen body and face to me. I told her how much I loved her and how sorry I was to not have been there for her. The two men took her away - I didn't watch - I didn't want to see her zipped up into what looked like a giant plastic pencil case. I was surprised that the authorities can simply arrive with a van and have the right to take my daughter away without even leaving a note to say who they are. Society Guardian columnist Judith Cameron on the sudden death of her severely disabled daughter, Sophie, July 5 Bottom of their class When we talk about black boys in Britain we tend to focus on their race, their ethnicity and their cultural background. And their failure inevitably throws light on the difficulties created for them by institutional racism. When we look at the failure of working-class white boys, however, what is emphasised about them is their social class position. This means the opportunity is lost to consider whether those black and white boys who are failing are doing so because of reasons to do with them being similarly working class, and that perhaps the prejudice they experience at school is an institutional class prejudice. By default, this means black people don't have a social class position and white people don't have an ethnic or cultural background, they are simply from the working, middle or upper classes. Social anthropologist Gillian Evans on why white, working-class boys fail, October 11 Absent voices Suddenly, our image is everywhere. Mixed-race people have become the acceptable face of ethnic minorities for advertisers and programme makers. We are sufficiently exotic for viewers and consumers to recognise as \"other\", and therefore a handy shorthand for diversity without the potential alienation associated with using somebody too black, too different, too dangerous. And yet there is an inconsistency. Despite our growth in numbers and our incredible visibility, we are utterly absent from any public debate on race. We appear to be the elephant in the room: obvious to anybody living in a large British city yet invisible at a government level. Take the discussion surrounding multiculturalism. The fact that people are increasingly falling in love, or simply in lust, and having children across a so-called racial divide is an inconvenient truth that challenges the government's notion of neat \"communities\" of black, white or Asian people. Laura Smith on being mixed race, September 6 The nightmare within On the day my mum was sectioned for the third time, we once again steeled ourselves for the inevitable swarm of social workers and other official busy-bodies who would descend in order to make sure my sisters and I were \"OK\". What this really meant was that social services would set about \"assessing\" whether my mum's problems constituted us being neglected. They would visit - which entailed hovering about the house for hours on end, asking questions about how we \"felt\" - and, with their inquisitions complete, they would do what they came for: make a decision about whether we should be taken into care. It was my worst fear. Anne Andrews recalls life as the child of an alcoholic, mentally ill mother, October 18, the service users edition Childcare on trial Children have one need above all: attention. Attention deficit is an adult incompetency, a flaw in a culture that views children as commodities - \"pass the parcel\" kids shuffled between separated parents, designer babies to complement the Jacuzzi, therapeutic Tamagotchis to repair relationships, cradle-candy for the fanzines, pirated \"treasures\" to create the ideal \"rainbow\" family. These are victims of institutional child abuse, and it is not a postcode problem. Single parent or double income, council flat or suburban ranch, social housing or stately home, on benefit or on a roll, all produce their share of children in need. Society Guardian columnist Stewart-Dakers on children in need, November 22 The state of emergencies So how far does he think a blogger and full-time ambulance worker can go to exert influence over politicians and policy makers? He seems to relish the chance to talk about this. \"I would love to say: 'Look, despite what your thinktank might say - this is what it's really like.' I'd love to collar Tony Blair. I would love nothing more than to take local councillors - the people who put in speed bumps - strap them on to the [stretcher] and go over some speed bumps. They'd be screaming to be let off within five minutes. And that's when they're healthy.\" Mary O'Hara meets ambulance blogger and author Tom Reynolds, August 30 Lost horizons There was a general dismay [among white working class Bethnal Green residents] at the way that British society appears to be changing. The evolution of the welfare state had turned it from a mutual aid society writ large into a complex, centralised and bureaucratic system, run by middle-class do-gooders, \"those big-hearted ones who've got their own big houses and make these rules\", as one interviewee put it. The system, it was felt, gave generously to those who put nothing into the pot, while making ordinary working people who did contribute feel like recipients of charity when drawing their entitlements. Geoff Dench and Kate Gavron on tensions in London's 'new' East End, February 8 Defining moment There's a tendency, rife in some branches of medicine, to sniff at psychiatry for not being scientific enough. Psychiatric disorders don't show up on a scanner; they can't be removed in the operating theatre. Psychiatric disorders can't be proven, and this unsettles the scientist. It unsettles the government as well, which wants concrete statistics on which to base funding decisions. And it unsettles the patients, who want to know what they've \"got\", what's \"wrong\" with them. \"I know what you're saying, Clare,\" says a friend. Cathy and I spent a year together, side by side in the (North London) day hospital common room. \"I was always schizoaffective up there. I was never 'manic depressive' till I moved to south London.\" Novelist and Society Guardian columnist Clare Allan reflects on mental health, April 19"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
