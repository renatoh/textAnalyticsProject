A report on Nine News in Melbourne, April Fools, showed Reid Butler approaching people who were sitting in the park and asking them why they weren\u2019t exercising. \u201cWe\u2019ve sent those images to Victoria police,\u201d the reporter tells newsreader Peter Hitchener. Nine defended the story. \u201cOur report highlighted the new regulations and showed what activities people can and cannot do,\u201d a Nine News spokesman said. \u201cWe used some actual examples and confirmed with the police what was the appropriate response and actions for people to take.\u201d Get a haircut and get a real job There\u2019s a growing clique of conservative commentators urging Australia to get back to work to save the economy. Andrew Bolt is the lead cheerleader, using his Sky News and News Corp newspaper platforms to undermine government messaging. Bolt advised his readers we could all be back at work in two weeks if we\u2019re just pragmatic. \u201cThings have changed with this coronavirus panic,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow Australians can be \u2013 must be \u2013 back at work within two weeks. \u201cThis virus now looks much less deadly than feared, and is highly selective, killing mostly the old \u2013 often people already close to death. \u201cThey must stop trying to quarantine millions of healthy and younger Australians who are desperate to get back to work and are highly unlikely to die from this virus. \u201cThey should quarantine just the potentially infectious and isolate the vulnerable \u2013 the frail and people over 65.\u201d Veteran Channel Ten weather man Tim Bailey\u2019s blunt response to Bolt was widely applauded. But Bolt is not alone. The Australian\u2019s economics editor, Adam Creighton, is adamant the measures in place are excessive for \u201conly\u201d 21 deaths. The Australian Financial Review columnist Parnell Palme McGuinness argued that Australia\u2019s \u201cChinese Communist Party-like\u201d controls \u201cmust be wound back before they corrode our ability to take calculated risks\u201d. \u201cSociety has shown it has a heart: now it is time to show we have a head as well,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth organs are required to ensure we don\u2019t make a bad situation much worse.\u201d School is in at the ABC The ABC has worked with state education departments to create an expanded schedule of free education content to support students, teachers and parents forced to work from home. For preschoolers there is even a special new episode of Play School which helps explains the pandemic in terms little kids can understand. From 14 April, when term two starts for most schools, ABC ME will have an educational schedule between 10am and 3pm each weekday. Blocks of primary school content in the mornings will be followed by material suitable for secondary pupils in the afternoon. ABC MD David Anderson: \u201cOur expanded schedule will complement the many hours of education content already available on the ABC across multiple platforms and we will build on that programming as required. Australians trust and rely on the ABC and this is another way we can contribute to and support the community.\u201d Online support through its portal ABC Education includes access to more than 4,000 free videos, interactive resources and games mapped to the Australian curriculum \u2013 across subjects such as English, maths, science, history, geography, media literacy, financial literacy and the arts and technologies, including STEM. ABC Education got an injection of funds from the New South Wales and Victorian education departments to create original teacher-led mini-lessons to be broadcast online and on ABC Me. Finally, don\u2019t forget the excellent Behind The News, which will continue to report on the news in a way kids can relate to as well as provide a vast back catalogue of informative videos. For adults, the ABC has the smash hit daily podcast from Dr Norman Swan, Coronacast podcast, as well as breaking radio news across RN, ABC News Radio and local radio, live announcements on the ABC News channel and daily in-depth coverage on 7.30, which had a very moving segment on kids saying hello to their grandparents. But not everyone is happy with the ABC\u2019s coverage of the pandemic. The Australian\u2019s media columnist Chris Mitchell was so annoyed by Fran Kelly\u2019s interview with health minister Greg Hunt he accused Radio National of being \u201ca shock-jock station\u201d. The former editor-in-chief of the Oz pointed to what he said were examples of excellent interviewing of officials by stablemates Chris Kenny and Andrew Bolt. Coronavirus strikes at News Corp HQ News Corp\u2019s headquarters in Holt St, Surry Hills, has three confirmed cases of coronavirus but the building remains open, albeit with just a handful of staff still turning up. \u201cWhile our health and safety experts continue to closely monitor the situation there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever the three cases are in any way linked, or that they were contracted at Holt St,\u201d a spokesman told Weekly Beast. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue working closely with NSW Health, which has advised that our Holt St building is safe to remain open. The very small number of staff who had close contact have been identified and informed. Work areas and other impacted areas have been thoroughly deep cleaned to required standards. Only people deemed essential to be in the office and with approval from their managers are working from Holt St. This represents a tiny fraction of our normal Holt St workforce.\u201d Job cuts and closures as media industry reels The media industry has been hit extremely hard by the coronavirus pandemic and every day there is more bad news for workers and the consumers who rely on their sources of news. Days after announcing it would have to close, regional newspaper Sunraysia Life is reviving its printed publication with a Saturday-only edition, a glimmer of hope in a bleak landscape. However, the print editions of 60 News Corp community newspapers will close by 9 April. Although News Corp has vowed to keep the digital community mastheads up, and has not announced any redundancies, Weekly Beast understands the print and digital staff are quite separate at some papers, and many print employees are likely to be affected. We\u2019ve spoken to several contributors who have already lost their gig on newspapers like the popular Sydney eastern suburbs giveaway the Wentworth Courier. On Friday another small independent publisher cancelled an edition and laid off staff. The McPherson Media Group has 14 newspapers across the Goulburn Valley and Southern Riverina in NSW, including the national publication Dairy News Australia. But the biggest companies have been hard hit too. The managing director and CEO of Seven, James Warburton, had to impose a pay cut on his workforce this week. Already under significant financial pressure, Seven has given all staff above $80,000 a 20% pay cut and a four-day working week. Staff on more than $200,000 will still get the 20% pay cut but will be expected to work five days a week \u201cto help the company navigate the current financial and Covid-19 challenges\u201d. \u201cAs you would be aware, we find ourselves in an extraordinary and challenging situation,\u201d Warburton said. \u201cWe are all working to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact it is having on our people, our business and the broader economy.\u201d But even these drastic measures may not be enough and \u201csome job losses will be inevitable\u201d, Warburton warned. This follows moves by News Corp to put most staff on a nine-day fortnight and make everyone take at least four days off over Easter. Sources told Weekly Beast photographers based at Holt St have been made to take annual and long service leave until the end of June. Nine Entertainment\u2019s newspapers, heavily reliant on advertising, have had to suspend production of magazines and inserts Boss, Sophisticated Traveller, Luxury, Good Food Magazine and Executive Style, the Traveller lift-out, Domain magazines and The Shortlist/EG event guides. Staff are being asked to take leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
