The jury of six women and two men declared the defendants not liable for damages on Wednesday after a two-week civil trial that channeled issues of sex, consent, race, money and celebrity into a Los Angeles courtroom. After the verdict, reached after less than four hours of deliberation, some jury members grinned and posed with Rose for photos outside the courtroom. The jury sided against the alleged victim, who was depicted as a sexually adventurous gold-digger, despite tearful testimony that she had been drugged and raped. She had sought $21.5m in damages. Upon hearing the decision, Rose cast his eyes to the floor and hugged his attorney; his accuser clamped her face in her hands in a prayer position. It was a climactic finale to a trial that put the judicial system\u2019s treatment of sexual assault cases under fresh scrutiny in the wake of controversy over the Stanford sexual assault case and allegations against Bill Cosby and Donald Trump. The New York Knicks point guard declined to comment on the case. \u201cI\u2019m just focused on the season,\u201d he told reporters before being driven away in an SUV. In a statement issued later he said: \u201cIt was important to prove I did not do what I was accused of, even if it meant publicly sharing very private details.\u201d The alleged victim\u2019s lawyer, Waukeen McCoy, called the outcome unjust and said his client was devastated. \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame for this country that a celebrity can come to court and slut-shame a woman.\u201d Her legal team is weighing an appeal, he said. Several jurors told reporters after the verdict that they found the defendants more credible than Doe. \u201cI felt like she was playing us,\u201d said one, who gave his name only as Jared. \u201cI think most of us believe it\u2019s possible there are pieces of her story that were true, but there just wasn\u2019t any evidence\u201d said another unnamed juror. The jury forewoman, Janet, said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to call her a liar ... I just didn\u2019t feel there was enough evidence.\u201d The New York Post quoted one unnamed female juror: \u201cWe really tried to believe her. We tried our hardest.\u201d But in the end her story \u201cdidn\u2019t add up\u201d. Rose\u2019s lawyer, Mark Baute, depicted the plaintiff as a manipulative liar who preyed on racist perceptions of black men to try extract a fortune even though she had welcomed the trio with \u201copen arms and open legs\u201d. He said he was \u201cvery happy the system worked\u201d and lambasted the media for what he said was biased trial coverage. Michael Monico, an attorney for Rose\u2019s two co-defendants, Randall Hampton and Ryan Allen, said: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that one woman and her false claims could cause this much difficulty for these three men.\u201d Within minutes of the verdict, Adidas said it would continue sponsoring Rose: \u201cOur partnership with Derrick remains unchanged.\u201d Rose and his friends, who grew up together in Chicago, had been accused of trespassing, sexual battery and battery. Sex and texts, sport and celebrity, claim and counter-claim, even, in a tragic sub-plot, the death of an investigating LAPD detective: it was a trial with conflicting, lurid details. The central fact was this: Rose, 28, and his two friends visited the plaintiff\u2019s LA apartment in the early hours of 27 August 2013 and had sex with her. The men said it was consensual. The plaintiff, known as Jane Doe to shield her identity, said she was too intoxicated to give consent. As civil litigation, rather than a criminal trial, the defendants faced paying damages but not jail time or a criminal conviction. They were found not liable, as opposed to not guilty. A criminal investigation by the LAPD remains open, but observers said the lack of physical evidence made charges unlikely. In the interest of transparency and not prejudicing the jury, Judge Michel Fitzgerald lifted Doe\u2019s anonymity once proceedings began. Most media outlets declined to use her real name but it seeped, along with photos and insults, on to the internet. Activists warned that this would deter victims from reporting sexual assaults. Some legal analysts had queried Rose\u2019s decision to gamble in court rather than settle. The New York Knicks point guard, the youngest player ever to win the NBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player award, imperiled his career and sponsorship deals. Wearing a dark suit, for almost two weeks he had sat under a clock, facing his alleged victim. They took turns facing ferocious barrages from opposing lawyers who accused them of lying, and worse. Rose and his friends committed rape, Doe\u2019s lawyer, McCoy, had said in closing arguments on Tuesday. \u201cThey have no remorse, they are not apologetic. She\u2019s not looking for a quick dollar. She\u2019s looking for accountability.\u201d Rose\u2019s equally combative lawyer, Baute, called Doe a gold-digger who was exploiting racist stereotypes of black men to extort a fortune. \u201cShe wants money,\u201d he said. \u201cShe lied 50 times on the stand.\u201d The media, he added, \u201cloves taking a black man down\u201d. Monico, the other defense lawyer, scorned Doe\u2019s testimony tears: \u201cShe has no evidence, but she can cry.\u201d Much of the case hinged on text messages Doe and Rose exchanged on the disputed night. One side argued they showed she had not agreed to group sex. The other agued that the fact she could text, including with punctuation, undercut her claim to have been too drunk \u2013 and possibly drugged \u2013 to consent. Doe and Rose had dated on and off for two years before the alleged assault. On the night of 26 August 2013 Doe went with a friend, Jessica \u201cKendra\u201d Groff, to Rose\u2019s rented Beverly Hills home. She became inebriated and after midnight took a taxi back to her apartment. Rose, Hampton and Allen arrived there a short time later, had intercourse with her and left. The case hinged on whether Doe was too incapacitated to agree to sex. Doe said she had blacked out, vomited and woke up around 3am to find the three men having sex with her but could not stop them and woke again after dawn with her dress around her neck, lubricant on her legs, a burning sensation between her legs and condoms around the bed. She was distraught, and told some confidantes she had been raped, but confusion and embarrassment delayed her filing a case for two years, she said. Concluding the case, Fitzgerald wished Doe the best, then turned to the basketball star and made a joke. \u201cMr Rose, my best wishes to you and your career \u2013 except when the Knicks play the Lakers.\u201d According to the advocacy group Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network, each year there are on average 288,820 victims of sexual assault in the US, most of whom do not report the crime. The collapse of Doe\u2019s case will likely draw comparisons with that of \u201cJackie\u201d, who claimed to be the victim of a rape portrayed in a now discredited Rolling Stone article that is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit. The magazine deleted a separate article, about the Rose trial, last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
