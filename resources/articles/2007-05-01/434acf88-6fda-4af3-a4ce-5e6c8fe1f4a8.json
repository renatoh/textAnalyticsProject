In the event the Dubliner held his nerve to end a 25-year wait for an Irish winner of the event, matching John O'Leary's success of 1982. Harrington, 35, headed into the final day with a three-stroke lead but by the 17th he had been caught at five under by Dredge. They could not be separated at the last so returned to the 18th for a sudden-death play-off which Harrington won with a par five after his opponent's third shot plugged in the riverbank guarding the green. The Ryder Cup veteran kept his cool to get up and down from 28 feet, sparking wild scenes at Adare Manor. \"It is great. I'm starting to get emotional. Throughout the day I had to keep on a level keel and it is only now it is starting to hit home,\" said Harrington. \"It is the fifth biggest tournament for me to win. I can win the four majors and then your home open is the next biggest event.\" Harrington admitted the passionate home fans had been both a help and a hindrance during a tense final round. \"I found it difficult today, no question about it. All the way through I was more nervous than I had been in many a tournament and I had to work very hard to stay focused. \"But the atmosphere was great, they were absolutely fantastic. I bogeyed the second hole and the applause I got going to the third tee really gave me a boost, gave me a lift, and I went and birdied that one.\" Back in 1982 O'Leary won \u00a313,000 for his victory, less than the player finishing a lowly 46th here takes home. He paid tribute to Harrington for matching his achievement. \"It's very appropriate for this great championship that Europe's No1 should be the first Irish player to get a win since then,\" O'Leary said. \"I'm personally delighted Padraig won today.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
