The world economy's engine is revving again. The doomsayers have been confounded by the Baghdad bounce in the US economy. Growth of 2.4 per cent in the second quarter, perky stock markets, free-spending consumers, a smaller trade deficit and a surge in productivity mean the good times are back. Rock and roll. Economics may come to be seen as the twenty-first-century equivalent of medieval alchemy. Certainly, George Bush's economic team, who held a summit at his Texas ranch last week, hope to conjure up an economic rebound. Their message was that a tax cut stimulus package would be enough to power growth. In fact, the tax cut is probably the least important prong of a trident of economic factors which could fuel a second-half rebound. The dollar's 20 per cent fall against major currencies since January 2002 and the low interest rate environment provided by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan are the other positive factors in this quasi-Keynesian attempt at reviving the US economy. After first-half growth of 1.9 per cent, independent economists expect a marked acceleration to between 3 and 4 per cent, as the strong cocktail of tax cuts, weak dollar and low interest rates works its magic. Indeed, after last week's better-than-expected trade figures - a sure reflection of a more competitive currency - second quarter growth could be revised up over 3 per cent. Even shoppers were doing their bit, having gone into hibernation at the peak of the fighting in Iraq. Child tax credit rebates have helped boost retail spending, which grew 1.4 per cent last month, having fallen back in April. That's the good news. The US economy has perked up a little. Bush's economic team is talking it up. The triple dose of macroeconomic medicine is in place. And stock markets are toying with the idea that the tonic will work. Two-thirds of US firms beat earnings expectations for the second quarter of this year. But there are a few reasons to see this glass as half empty. Bears are taking comfort from some curious qualities to this recovery phase. When the first shoots of recovery are sprouting, one would expect corporate insiders to share that confidence. A report from Thomson Financial last week showed that executives sold $2.4 billion worth of their own companies' stock last month and bought just $73 million worth. Stock-owning execs are voting with their feet and are at their most bearish level since May 2001, despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average being up 24 per cent since March's low. 'The insiders are selling at a breathtaking rate,' says James Montier, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. 'If insiders cashing out continues at the pace seen in the first week of August, the monthly total will be $19bn. That would be the highest reading since early 2000.' He thinks he knows why. Despite the scandals of last year, the 'accounting suspension of disbelief is still going strong this year among investors'. He points to the widespread use of 'meaningless' pro forma earnings numbers and over-optimism on the rebuilding of corporate balance sheets. 'The level of net debt among the S&amp;P 500 is some 20 per cent above the peak of the dotcom bubble,' he points out. In such conditions, corporates are left with one option to boost performance - slashing back costs and manpower. Nearly 20 months into this recovery phase, not a single net new job has been created. In fact 1.2 million have been lost. This, says Stephen Roach, Morgan Stanley's chief economist, compares with an average of 2.8 million jobs created in the first 20 months of the past six recovery phases in the US economy. 'The current hiring trajectory has fallen fully 4 million workers short of the cyclical norm - taking the concept of \"jobless recovery\" that was first coined in the early Nineties to an entirely different level,' he says. Gregory Mankiw, head of Bush's council of economic advisers, says growth may have to top 3.7 per cent before it starts to create jobs. Mankiw, a former academic most famous for his graduate textbook on macroeconomics, will be hoping that theory is borne out. This may be recovery, but it's nothing like what has been seen before. The housing market and the car sector will not lead the economy back to boom time, as is normally the case, as demand in these sectors has remained strong through the dip. Economists argue that very low interest rates have simply seen spending 'stolen from the future' as consumers take advantage of cheap financing deals. So there is a risk that in an economy which has lost nearly 3 million jobs under the Bush administration, consumers stop spending. Roach says that this is 'the dark side to America's productivity bonanza'. Firms are slashing back on jobs to boost their bottom lines, but ultimately there is little business pricing power. If job-insecure consumers retrench before corporate pricing power and profitability return, the engine risks stalling. Roach, long established at the bearish end of Wall Street, says: 'There can be no mistaking the persistence of decidedly sub-par growth. Over the first seven quarters of this so-called recovery, annualised gains in real GDP growth have averaged a mere 2.6 per cent. By contrast, over the first seven quarters of the past six cyclical upturns, real GDP growth averaged 5.4 per cent - slightly more than double the current pace. The current recovery even falls short of the previous record slowpoke - the 3.1 per cent pace recorded in the first seven quarters following the 1990-91 recession.' For good measure, Roach points out the unusual reliance of the second-quarter growth figures on military spending associated with war in Iraq, and assumptions about declining IT prices. This is not the storming recovery sought by impatient investors and a President facing an election battle just yet. The Federal Reserve remains more worried about deflation and economic relapse than of inflation running too high. Alongside last week's decision to retain a Federal Funds rate of 1 per cent, it suggested that rates could be kept this low 'for a considerable period'. The US economy could be moving sideways in a crab-like fashion for some years. While its performance is vastly superior to that of the completely stagnant Eurozone, the shadow of late 1990s excess remains. That dotcom hangover is still looming over the world's biggest economy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
