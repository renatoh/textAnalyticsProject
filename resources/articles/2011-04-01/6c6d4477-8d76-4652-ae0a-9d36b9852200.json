Unlike the crab apple tree, however, the enormous cherry tree stands in a field towards the east of the county near Maulds Meaburn, with its white blossom just starting to show like a magnificent snowball as part of the rural scene of the Eden Valley. With a girth of 18ft (5.3 metres), the tree is on the edge of the village and is the size of a mature oak. Its few days of splendour when festooned in cascades of brilliant white blossom are quite luminously so; the virginal canopy coaxed out of its buds by the warmth of the sun, a sharp contrast to the gnarled and reddish-brown bark of the trunk below. Here the timber is so whorled, coiled, knotted and interweaved, it might be a Francis Bacon depiction of writhing limbs. It is difficult to imagine it as the cherished hardwood so prized for a variety of uses, from the backs of violins to box beams where a strong, closed grain is a prerequisite. The blossoms, which vanish should the legendary Helm Wind whip down from the Pennines (a phenomenon said to gain such speeds it can blow cows over walls and gates from their hinges), presage the crop of cherries in high summer that makes the boughs bend to the weight of the fruit. If locals from neighbouring houses can pick them before the birds swoop, what delicious cherry pie results (as one woman discovered when the juice for such a confection proved so succulent it splattered on the kitchen walls). Following the rigours of a hard winter, it is good, say the locals, to see this landmark tree in its pomp with the arrival of spring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
