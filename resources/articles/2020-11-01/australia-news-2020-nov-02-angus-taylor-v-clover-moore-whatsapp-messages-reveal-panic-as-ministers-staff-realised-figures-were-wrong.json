But despite that, the federal energy minister and the Daily Telegraph, which reported the figures on 30 September 2019, did nothing to correct the record until Moore wrote a formal letter of complaint on 22 October. Guardian Australia revealed the mistake soon afterwards, prompting questions in parliament. The Guardian has now obtained more documents and been informed by Taylor\u2019s office that the two staff referred to in the documents have left his employment. The documents were released by the minister in settlement of a case the Guardian brought in the administrative appeals tribunal under the Freedom of Information Act. They include a series of WhatsApp messages between Taylor and his staff that cast light on the saga surrounding the original dodgy document. The WhatsApp messages begin on 29 September 2019, the night before the Telegraph published a story by Anna Caldwell under the headline \u201cCity of Sydney Council\u2019s outlay on flights outstrips that of Australian foreign ministers\u201d. The story quoted from the letter Taylor had sent to Moore on that day, including the incorrect information that \u201cyour council spent $1.7m on international travel and $14.2m on domestic travel\u201d. The Telegraph sought comment from Moore\u2019s office just before publication. It strongly disputed the figures as being grossly inflated. Someone at the Telegraph then queried the figures with the minister\u2019s office. What followed was a series of frantic communications between two staff members in Taylor\u2019s office referred to only as MS1 and MS2 (their names remain redacted) from just before 6pm until 7.30pm, as they realised something was amiss. Josh Manuatu is a former staff member named publicly in the Australian newspaper as being involved in the saga. He left the office in June to become the director of the Australian Capital Territory Liberals. There are gaps in the conversation \u2013 it may have continued verbally \u2013 but at 5.54pm MS1, believed to be a senior member of Taylor\u2019s staff, looked at the council\u2019s annual report online and realised the mistake. \u201cAm I reading this right?\u201d he texted. \u201cThe cost of interstate visits undertaken by councillors while representing the City including the cost of transport, the cost of accommodation and other out-of-pocket expenses was $4206.32. \u201cThe cost of overseas visits undertaken by Councillors while representing the Council including the cost of transport, the cost of accommodation and other out of pocket travelling expenses was $1,727.77.\u201d These were the correct figures, which the Sydney council says have always been on its website, unaltered. Fifteen minutes later MS1 sends another text to MS2. \u201cHow you tracking [MS2]? Found it?\u201d MS2 replies: \u201cTrying to infiltrate office.\u201d This presumably refers to trying to enter the ministerial office on a Sunday evening to retrieve the hard copy of the document with the incorrect figures. Taylor has told parliament the false document was accessed and printed by his office. At 6.34pm MS2 sends to MS1 a photo of the page with the incorrect numbers. They appear to be in a different format to those used elsewhere in the report. Just after 7pm, MS2 tells MS1: \u201c6 September.\u201d This is the date that the Telegraph says it was told the document was accessed by Taylor\u2019s office on the City of Sydney website. In between, there is further chatter that has been redacted. It is understood this redacted material involves discussion of the Telegraph and the impending inaccurate story. At 7.38pm, MS1 then breaks the news of the discrepancies to Taylor. \u201cBoss, just a heads up for tomorrow,\u201d he says via WhatsApp. \u201cThe City of Sydney Council has altered their annual report numbers online since we originally accessed them. So we know Clover Moore will dispute that she has spent so much on travel. \u201cI still think the onus is on her to explain why their numbers were wrong (their new numbers seem impossibly low, so I suspect they are wrong as well). And it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Sydney City Councillors made around two dozen overseas trips in 2017-18. It is a bit messier than we\u2019d hoped. I will send the screenshots shortly.\u201d Screenshots of the inaccurate document, the real page from the annual report and the published list of overseas trips during 2017-18 were also sent to the minister. MS1\u2019s advice on the city\u2019s trip list was itself inaccurate. The list of 24 international trips was for the entire council, including staff, and it shows that for the most part the lion\u2019s share of the expenses on the trips had been met by someone else, with only incidentals claimed. This may explain why the figures were \u201cimpossibly low\u201d. \u201cMessier\u201d than hoped for turned out to be an understatement. How Taylor reacted to the snafu that Sunday night is not recorded. Over the next few days, Moore went on Twitter to dispute the Telegraph story and her staff took up her concerns with Caldwell. The reporter initially claimed she had a document that proved she was right but, after sending it to the council, she too must have realised her mistake. At that point, Moore realised there was a false document circulating. Perhaps Taylor thought the dispute with Moore would disappear. But, after failing to secure an apology from the Telegraph and asking her IT staff to investigate whether there was ever another version of the document online \u2013 she says there was not \u2013 on 22 October Moore wrote to Taylor seeking a public correction. The next day the story appeared on the Guardian Australia site and Taylor found himself under siege in parliament. As the pressure mounted, MS1 requested that Taylor\u2019s energy department search the IT logs of the minister\u2019s office to establish the exact time when MS2 accessed the document from the city\u2019s website and to gather \u201cany available information for any accessed or downloaded documents \u2026 including metadata and content\u201d. MS1 also asked for records of the printing of the document. The response from the department was not released as part of the FoI requests and has never been made public. But public servants told Senate estimates in January that they had detected \u201cthat the City of Sydney\u2019s website was accessed by the minister\u2019s office on 9 September 2019\u201d. \u201cThe department has no records of PDF or Word file documents being downloaded from that visit. The department\u2019s system allows individuals to directly print from a website,\u201d they said, adding there were no more downloads before 29 September. So what really happened on that Sunday night? The WhatsApp messages reveal that MS1, the senior staff member, was surprised by the turn of events. There has been much speculation that the false document might have been supplied by a third party intent on mischief. This theory was fuelled when FoI requests by the Sydney Morning Herald and the Guardian revealed \u201cmessages between the minister\u2019s office and an external third party\u201d. These were withheld because they would do \u201cunreasonable harm to the person\u2019s business\u201d. But it\u2019s now thought they were WhatsApp communications between Caldwell and her source as she discovered that she too had been duped. News Corp Australia joined as a party in the AAT proceedings to fight the release of the documents. The Guardian did not pursue their release. Taylor\u2019s office continues to insist the document existed on the City of Sydney\u2019s website and that\u2019s where it came from. But he and his staff have been unable to find it again. He insists it was not altered or forged by his office. It is not known whether Taylor was given a copy of the page out of the annual report when he signed the fateful letter to Moore with the wrong numbers on 27 September. Guardian Australia was told that the usual correspondence processes were followed: a draft from the department, edits by staff, review by the chief of staff and then presentation in a folder to the minister along with the original letter and any other relevant documents. Usually ministers sign dozens of letters at once. A spokesman for the FoI decision-maker said he had agreed to release the documents that were provided because \u201ccircumstances have changed\u201d. \u201cThe AFP and the NSW police have closed the investigations they were undertaking at that time. There is now no reason to withhold these documents.\u201d The lord mayor asked why the Daily Telegraph and Taylor pushed on with the publication of the report when they both knew the figures were incorrect. \u201cWhy did it take so long to force a correction?\u201d she said when told of the WhatsApp messages. \u201cThis was a hostile response to our climate actions and advocacy, both by the minister responsible for emissions reduction and the Daily Telegraph. \u201cA year has passed and the government has still not explained what happened, where the false documents originated, or who should be held responsible.\u201d Moore complained to the Press Council, which declined to take action because the Telegraph had included Moore\u2019s response in its initial report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
