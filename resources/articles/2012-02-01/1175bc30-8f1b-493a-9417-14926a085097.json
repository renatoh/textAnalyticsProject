Seven of those have yet to meet the new qualifying standard and the final field may dip below the maximum of 40 runners for the first time since 1999, which would be a shame for at least two reasons. The first is the general one that, like the course, the obstacles, the trip and the tradition, a big field contributes to the National's unique appeal. Of course, the field has dropped below 30 in fairly recent memory and the National has survived but it is still hard to sell an event as the one that everyone in jumps racing wants to win if, on a regular basis, it does not fill. It would be a particular frustration this year, because a field of 40 would make for a much more reliable comparison with last year's race, when overhead shots of dead and injured horses, Jason Maguire's use of the whip on Ballabriggs and the dousing of horses with buckets of water after crossing the line were widely viewed as a PR disaster. If there really were thousands of once-a-year punters who were so appalled by the scenes at Aintree that they decided never to bet on the race again, the betting turnover on this year's race would, presumably, take a significant hit. And my strong suspicion is that, if 40 runners go to post in April, the effect of last year's race on this year's turnover will be ... none whatsoever. The fact that Aintree has made some minor tweaks to the course and race conditions since last year is irrelevant. So, too, are the hopelessly misguided new whip rules which are a result, at least in part, of Maguire's winning ride (for which he got a five-day ban even under the old whip-rule regime). For the great majority of the people who bet on the National it is their only point of contact with racing all year, and whatever has happened in between will have passed them by. It remains a frustration that so many people see the National as being representative of all racing, because nothing could really be further from the truth. But then, there are probably a fair number of people who think that all bookies are like Peter Barlow too, which can't do much for the betting industry. It is just the way of the world. The modern Grand National is as safe as it is ever likely to be in its familiar, 40-runner form but all the factors that make it unique also mean that the chance of a fatality in any given year \u2013 though odds-against \u2013 is still significantly higher than in any other major jumps race. The Cheltenham Gold Cup has not lost a runner to a fatal fall since Gloria Victis in 2000. In the same time eight horses have been killed in the Grand National. How many horses go to post for this year's National remains to be seen, though it is quite possible that the drop in entries is simply down to realism among owners and trainers about the chance of an average horse getting a run in the race. But if one or more of the runners fail to return, what must be avoided is any leap to the conclusion, by either the racecourse or the British Horseracing Authority, that \"something must be done\" to respond to public concern, particularly if, like the whip rules, that Aintree-related \"something\" is going to be foisted on the rest of the programme as well. Despite the low initial entry, there is still every chance that a full field will go to post on 14 April. If betting turnover holds up too, it will be a more telling reflection of the general public's attitude to the National than any vox pop or internet poll in the aftermath of last year's race. It will suggest that they are willing to accept the Grand National for what it is. It will also raise the question as to why both Aintree and the British Horseracing Authority seem to find it so hard to do the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
