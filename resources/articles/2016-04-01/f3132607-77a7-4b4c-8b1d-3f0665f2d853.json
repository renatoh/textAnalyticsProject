The report on Wormwood Scrubs, released on Tuesday, includes a foreword by the new chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, who highlights the poor condition of the prison \u2013 outlining high levels of assaults, worsening safety records, suicides, easy access to drugs and even a rat problem. But an earlier draft leaked to the Guardian, which was written by the previous chief inspector, Nick Hardwick, before he stepped down in January, contained much tougher language. Hardwick announced in the first paragraph of his introduction that the prison remained in a \u201cshameful condition\u201d; Clarke\u2019s version said it was in a \u201cpoor condition\u201d. The earlier version also reported that one in 10 prisoners at Wormwood Scrubs said they had been physically assaulted and that \u201ctoo many prisoners at risk of suicide or self-harm were held in the segregation unit without any explanation of the exceptional reasons required to justify it\u201d. These details are absent from Clarke\u2019s introduction. In his concluding paragraph, Hardwick described meeting an 18-year-old who had for several months spent at least 22 hours a day in a cell with a broken window and a toilet that stank. The prisoner was also set to be homeless once released. \u201cIt was hard to identify anything that had happened in the prison that might improve the odds on him staying out of trouble when he left \u2013 and it was easy to see much that made them worse. There were many prisoners like him,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe prison stands as an object lesson in the need for radical reform.\u201d The published version reaches a dryer conclusion that notes: \u201cWormwood Scrubs is a prison that continues to fall short of expected standards.\u201d Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \u201cIt raises concerns if the new chief inspector feels he is unable to be as robust as we would hope. The chief inspector must talk truth to the justice secretary and to the public about prison conditions as people die in jails, assaults and violence are everyday events, and that spills out into the community affecting us all.\u201d The role of chief inspector of prisons is an independent position, decided by open competition. Clarke, the former Scotland Yard head of counter-terrorism, was appointed to replace Hardwick and started in January. However, before he started there was some unease when it emerged in a justice select committee hearing last year that he had been telephoned by Michael Gove to see if he would be interested in the job. An HM Inspectorate of Prisons spokeswoman rejected the suggestion that the report had been toned down. She said the changes to the report were made because Hardwick\u2019s original version was too long and contained personal observations Clarke had not witnessed. \u201cSome amends were made to the introduction of this report to make it shorter, sharper and more impactful, but the substance of this extremely critical report has not changed \u2026 This report is one of the most critical published by the inspectorate in recent years,\u201d she said. The Ministry of Justice said it could not comment. The final version of the inspection report remains highly critical of conditions in Wormwood Scrubs, where outcomes for the 1,258 men held there are still \u201cunacceptably poor\u201d. It concludes that most prisoners still have less than two hours a day out of the cells, the levels of use of force were far higher than in similar prisons, and the number of prisoners being made homeless on release had risen by 5% to 40% since resettlement services were outsourced to the London Community Rehabilitation Company. Jo Stevens, shadow prisons minister, said: \u201cIt is absolutely vital that HM Inspectorate of Prisons is able to produce reports with total independence free from any interference or influence \u2026 This shocking inspection report raises huge questions about the Ministry of Justice\u2019s competence to address the worsening Tory prison crisis.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
