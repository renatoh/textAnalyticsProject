With its crisply drawn, unfussy visuals, Wrinkles is about Emilio, an elderly ex-bank manager who reluctantly enters a retirement home and tries to hide the onset of Alzheimer's. Oh yes, all the joyous things are here \u2013 dementia, incontinence, callous adult offspring \u2013 and yet Wrinkles is a tender, life-affirming piece, mischievous although it never tries to package its theme in a falsely cheery Last of the Summer Wine fashion. The American dubbing is done by Martin Sheen, as sobersided Emilio, and Matthew Modine as his son \u2013 but the winning turn is by veteran George Coe, as charismatic and often downright obnoxious old cynic Miguel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
