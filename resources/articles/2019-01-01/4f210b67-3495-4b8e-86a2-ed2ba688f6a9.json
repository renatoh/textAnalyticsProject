We had a great team and they had a very good one. It was a special rivalry and I\u2019m not sure the Premier League has seen anything like it since, although perhaps Manchester City and Liverpool at the moment are close. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how long that lasts, because we are hoping to get up to that level again soon. Twenty years ago it was just us and Arsenal for a long time, going at each other, going for the title. It was just between the two of us until Jos\u00e9 came along with Chelsea, I can\u2019t remember any other challengers. Maybe one year Liverpool were half close but that was it.\u201d So intense was the rivalry that Solskj\u00e6r was astonished to see Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira make a television programme together a few years ago, when in their playing days they were more famous for being at each other\u2019s throats. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used to be fighting all the time. There was a nice little fight in the tunnel in that 4-2 game where John O\u2019Shea scored the winning goal [February 2005], but whenever we played Arsenal in those days there were fights in the tunnels and on the pitch. It was just everything I loved about football, that passion is part of the game. I\u2019m sure the fans could feel it as well, that\u2019s what makes it so interesting. I hope the next game is as good as some of the ones we have had in the past.\u201d In terms of FA Cup meetings the one everyone remembers most vividly is the semi-final in 1999, with its replay, Peter Schmeichel penalty save and Ryan Giggs\u2019s stunning winner. Solskj\u00e6r played in both, though had been substituted by the time Giggs went on his slaloming run in extra-time at Villa Park. \u201cI watched that goal from the sidelines, but the two sides were so evenly matched we all knew it was such an important game,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI firmly believe that Peter saving that penalty from Dennis Bergkamp gave us the impetus to go on and win the treble. If Bergkamp had scored I think Arsenal would have won the double. That\u2019s how small the margins were, and that is why it is still a standout memory for me.\u201d While Solskj\u00e6r would go on to make his own indelible contribution to the treble and Manchester United history with his stoppage-time winner against Bayern Munich in Barcelona, a slightly less celebrated fact is that he did the same thing against Liverpool in a fourth\u2011round tie at Old Trafford almost exactly 20 years ago this weekend. United had trailed to a Michael Owen goal for most of the game, but two goals in the last three minutes from Dwight Yorke and Solskj\u00e6r saw them through. Newspapers at the time produced the same \u201csmash and grab\u201d headlines they would later use for the jaw-dropping conclusion to the Champions League final, and when Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s winner went in there were even pictures of Liverpool players dropping to the ground as if poleaxed in exactly the manner made famous by Sammy Kuffour and his fellow defenders in the Camp Nou. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s interventions from the substitutes\u2019 bench deservedly earned him renown; a month after the Liverpool game he came on in a league match at Nottingham Forest and scored four goals in 12 minutes, but without his lesser known last\u2011gasp winner the dreams of a treble might have been stifled at an early stage. Solskj\u00e6r is presently making a name for himself all over again in a different capacity at Old Trafford. Seven wins in succession is impressive whatever the calibre of opposition, and after beating Tottenham at Wembley this month there is no reason for United and their engaging young manager to fear a trip to the Emirates Stadium. Already proving an inspired managerial solution if the object of the exercise is to provide an antidote to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s suspicion and sarcasm, Solskj\u00e6r gives the impression of positively relishing the challenge. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure it\u2019s a good game of football,\u201d he said, after confirming Alexis S\u00e1nchez will come in to play against his old club. Is he not worried about the Chilean being mocked by the Arsenal crowd on account of his stuttering form in Manchester? \u201cI think he\u2019ll love it,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cAs a player, pride kicks in if the crowd turns against you. You think: \u2018I\u2019ll show all of you.\u2019 I have no worries at all about Alexis being involved. He\u2019s been fantastic in training, his attitude has been spot on, so hopefully he\u2019ll enjoy the game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
