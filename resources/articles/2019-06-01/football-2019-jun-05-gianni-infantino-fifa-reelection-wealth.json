This year in Paris Blatter\u2019s thunderously ambitious replacement, the Swiss former Uefa secretary general Gianni Infantino, sailed to another unopposed re-coronation in an atmosphere around Fifa that was remarkably less stormy. He had greeted this annual gathering for the presidents and officials of football\u2019s 211 countries by claiming his is \u201ca new Fifa\u201d, transformed from pariah status since his election in 2016. \u201cWe have turned things around,\u201d he maintained. \u201cFifa has gone from being toxic, almost criminal, to what it should be: an organisation that develops and cares about football.\u201d Infantino then regaled the convention hall with a roll call of his achievements: the fabulous success of last year\u2019s World Cup, which Fifa says amassed three billion unique views around the globe and had a billion watching the final; VAR was introduced with no going back to mere human refereeing, the Women\u2019s World Cup is about to kick off in France, spearheading a strategy to develop women\u2019s football to 60 million participants by 2026. There were hymns to football\u2019s life-changing properties, curiously similar to the old Fifa\u2019s tunes Blatter sang: a vehicle for education, hope, \u201ctrust, integrity, equality, human rights\u201d. Referring to a speech he made at a meeting in December of the G20 world economic powers, Infantino said: \u201cI was invited to talk about the impact football can have in an ever more divided world: we are one of the things that can bring people together rather than divide them.\u201d But the weightiest ballast for Fifa\u2019s supertanker, cause of the general air of satisfaction on deck, which Infantino knowingly emphasised, is the vast stack of dollars in the hold. For all the scandals, blown open most infamously by the arrests of Fifa high-ups in Zurich at the dawn of Blatter\u2019s re-election in 2015, football is ever more phenomenally loved and popular. So Fifa\u2019s trademarked World Cup means it owns in a divided, digital world the most lucrative content with which television can bring people together. The bulk of this congress was taken up with recitations of Fifa\u2019s eye-watering \u2013 and, here, immensely crowd-pleasing \u2013 amounts of rolling revenue. With sponsorship and other World Cup rights having been sold, as Infantino justifiably said, \u201cwhen people said nobody would want to associate with Fifa\u201d, the tournament raked in $5.4bn. In total Fifa made $6.4bn in 2014-18. One telling detail in Fifa\u2019s annual report indicated the rising power of China. Of the seven main Fifa commercial partners, five World Cup sponsors and eight \u201cregional supporters\u201d, whose endorsements amounted to $1.7bn, seven were Chinese. \u201cChinese businesses had an unprecedented presence at the 2018 World Cup,\u201d the report said. Talk around Fifa has turned already to whether China will bid to host the 2030 World Cup. Qatar survived all challenges to it hosting in 2022, including Infantino\u2019s failed effort to expand the tournament from 32 to 48 teams, while the US, Canada and Mexico are confirmed to host in 2026. The English FA, always game for a bid after missing out for 2006 and 2018, is conducting a feasibility study for a joint 2030 pitch with Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland. But if China does decide to bid, the FA is likely to view that as so strategically significant to Fifa that it may not be worth spending time, money and energy on a rival effort. Infantino acknowledged that if China is to bid a change would be needed to the rules that a regional confederation must miss two World Cups before it can host again. Qatar\u2019s hosting in 2022 as part of the Asian Football Confederation would mean China not being eligible until 2034, but Infantino hinted the change will be made to reduce the rotation to only one tournament and thereby accommodate a Chinese 2030 bid. \u201cFor me, the more the merrier \u2013 the more bidders we have, the happier I am,\u201d he said. Speaking seven languages through his presidential address but keenly aware of one all his audience understands, Infantino and his executives repeatedly stressed how much of the booming revenues are going to the national associations. At the contested post-Blatter 2016 election, Infantino famously swung the room when he told the countries: \u201cThe money of Fifa is your money.\u201d He ran that line again here. \u201cFifa\u2019s money is your money,\u201d he said. \u201cYour money, for the development of football.\u201d Several times they were told how much they have had under the \u201cForward\u201d development programme and how much more they can look forward to: $1.079bn since its launch in 2016, a further \u00a31.7bn to 2022. Taking his turn with the same figures, Fifa\u2019s finance committee chairman, Alejandro Dom\u00ednguez, told the hall: \u201cI dare say we should have a round of applause here for the president.\u201d Which they duly had. Fifa is adamant this mega-money, $6m to each association over four years, is building targeted, concrete football projects, many in poorer countries, and is not pork-barrel politics for local officials who could pocket it. Fifa\u2019s administrators say they have robust checks, release money only according to specified \u201cmilestones\u201d on projects, and conduct central audits. They point to the six-year, six-month ban handed down by Fifa\u2019s ethics committee in March to former Oceania president David Chung for \u201coffering and accepting gifts\u201d and the eight-year ban of the same confederation\u2019s former general secretary Tai Nicholas for misappropriating funds in relation to a Forward-funded HQ programme, the Home of Football in New Zealand. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending it on dodgy deals,\u201d Infantino said, \u201cwe\u2019re investing it with you and checking [the projects are] done.\u201d Infantino has pounded on unscathed from his administration\u2019s removal in 2017 of the ethics committee chairmen who had mounted preliminary investigations into him and the ousting of the governance committee chairman Miguel Maduro, who maintains pained concerns about Fifa\u2019s workings. Over days of Fifa business in Paris there was not a whisper about that landmark early brutality and delegates were invited to approve Infantino for another term by \u201cacclamation\u201d rather than through the farce of a one-man actual election which the football world lampooned in 2011. This meant, it was explained, that Infantino would be duly elected for the job, which had a $2.5m salary package last year, by a round of applause. Thumping home the scale of Infantino\u2019s ascendancy the vice-president with the job of explaining that was Sheikh Salman, his beaten rival of 2016. The applause came as a ripple rather than a wave and Infantino returned for a victory speech. He said he was humbled, then repeated many of his achievements, including the $2.75bn Fifa has in its reserves. The congress, overall, was notably calm, compliant and pleased with itself, a testament above all to football\u2019s phenomenal power and currency in an uncertain and volatile world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
