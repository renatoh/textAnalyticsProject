It was holding station above pastureland to the east of the town as we were taking young Henri for his evening constitutional. The evening sun lit up the hovering hawk and I became increasingly interested in the bird as we drew nearer. It had all the characteristics of the kestrel, both in flight and hover performance, and the narrow wing and fantail confirmed this was a falcon. The only puzzle was its unusually large size. I was not sure that kestrels could grow to this size and went home to check the bird books, starting with Peterson, Mountfort and Hollom's Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe, which I still reckon to be the best authority. All the characteristics fitted only the kestrel and I went to bed reckoning that, short of some unusual foreign vagrant, we had just seen a particularly large female kestrel hunting for a spot of evening sustenance for nestlings. On the tee the following morning I mentioned the sighting to Dave, the best bird man I know, and the sort of observer who can hear a cheep in a bush and instantly say, \"that's a dunnock\". Dave combines some unusual interests with the bird knowledge his father inculcated. In summer he rides a large-capacity motorbike, and plays golf to a single-figure handicap. But he's always ready to answer a bird question, so I told him about the hawk we had watched the previous evening. \"On that description it can only be a kestrel,\" he said. All of which has led me to the conclusion that a large kestrel is probably far less unusual in the total population than my limited perspective would recognise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
