How News Corp remains in thrall to the Melbourne Cup", "bodyText": "The Melbourne Cup is \u201cin every sense a sacred occasion, unique to the Western world\u201d, a commentator in the Australian wrote on Monday, the day before the big race. The Daily Telegraph printed a 28-page liftout but it was the Herald Sun, being the tabloid in the hometown of the Melbourne Cup, which devoted the most space in the lead-up: 39 pages of racing and gambling pages on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 40 on Monday. There is no shortage of hyperbole when it comes to the print media\u2019s obsession with the horse racing industry\u2019s two biggest events: the Melbourne Cup and in recent years, Sydney\u2019s Everest. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age also embrace the events, but their coverage is more modest and their racing guides are a fraction the size of the Murdoch papers\u2019 pages. The spring racing carnival is an opportunity for front-page stories, colourful wrap-arounds, liftouts, fashion features, racing guides, office sweep guides and endless reports on the jockeys, trainers and horses. And the animal cruelty scandal has not diminished the coverage of the Melbourne Cup. Streem media monitoring says in the week leading up to the cup there were 4,044 news items across online, print, radio and TV in 2018. It is slightly up this year, to 4,284. But has it had an impact on what the public thinks? The horse racing writer Ken Callander says race attendances are down but gambling keeps the sport alive. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got to look at the money that\u2019s invested in horse races with the corporate bookmakers and you realise that there\u2019s still a great interest,\u201d Callander told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf you go into any hotel or club on a Saturday afternoon \u2026 you\u2019ll be amazed by the interest of the punters in the TAB areas.\u201d The interest is not so much in the racing itself but in the gambling. \u201cAs much as the purists like to kid that it\u2019s not, gambling supports racing,\u201d Callander says. \u201cAnd I love the horses and I love the race. But it\u2019d be naive to say that the average Joe\u2019s interest in racing extends far past the dollar.\u201d The key to why the newspapers are such fans of horse racing lies in the amount of money that pours in to the depleted coffers of the newspapers from the racing and gambling industry each year. Over the past 12 months, Nielsen Ad Intel reports an estimated advertising spend of $27.9m on horse racing. There are dozens of advertisers including Moonee Valley Racing Club, Racing NSW, Racing Victoria and TattsBet Ltd, the parent company for betting brands TAB, Unitab and UBET and others. A former News Corp executive said at one stage in the 1990s some of the tabloids were running a form guide of 60 or 70 pages each week. \u201cThe TAB came to us and said, \u2018You\u2019re running 20 pages a week, what about you run 50 pages a week,\u2019 and then it was increased dramatically to 60 or 70 pages a week,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ran everything, including the overseas exotic races, in exchange for a significant amount of money. It\u2019s nothing like an advertising page rate but when you add it all up over the year it\u2019s a significant amount of money from each of the state-based organisations, which was then backed up as well by advertising spend. \u201cThe deals started to get more complex when the newspapers were trying to defend their position. Like everything in the print media in the last 10 years everything has been renegotiated. Then you got the entry of the private bookmakers and the online bookies, and they started sponsoring some of the pages.\u201d After a 50-year career as a leading racing commentator Callander stormed out of the Daily Telegraph in 2015 because he felt he was being censored when he wrote about the governing body of the industry, Racing NSW. Now retired, Callander wants to put the stoush with News Corp behind him but at the time he said the Daily Telegraph is a \u201cpropaganda sheet for Racing NSW\u201d. The commercial arrangements around the publication of the form guides and the lucrative broadcasting rights make it tricky for journalists to report critically on the industry, sources say. It was the public broadcaster, which has no commercial ties, that revealed widespread acts of animal cruelty against racehorses on ABC\u2019s 7.30 last month. A former News Corp sports editor told Guardian Australia the form guide drives circulation and in some states the form guide was so lucrative it paid for the newsprint. \u201cFriday is always the bestselling paper because of the form guide,\u201d he says. \u201cJournos used to pour scorn on the advertising guys but when the revenues turned sour attitudes changed. \u201cThe TAB\u2019s relationship with the paper is powerful. I can tell you for a fact they\u2019re hopelessly compromised. The TAB doubles down and buys more advertising when there\u2019s a negative story.\u201d Figures are hard to come by, but the Sydney Morning Herald reported in 2016 that the Tele received $4m to $6m every year from Racing NSW to publish the form guide. A devotion to the races runs deep at News Corp, especially in Victoria where the managing director of the Herald and Weekly Times, Peter Blunden, is an enthusiast of horse racing and a director of the Moonee Valley Racing Club. The journalist and anti-gambling campaigner Stephen Mayne believes Blunden\u2019s close links to the racing industry are in conflict with his role on the Herald Sun. \u201cBlunden has an obvious conflict of interest being a director of the Moonee Valley Racing Club,\u201d Mayne told Guardian Australia. \u201cHow can the Herald Sun possibly cover the racing industry objectively when the man in charge is one of the people responsible for stewarding and directing Victoria\u2019s racing industry?\u201d But Blunden denied there was a conflict. \u201cAs a lifelong racing enthusiast, a horse lover and unashamed supporter of the sport, I also know how to balance the challenges confronting the industry,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe have led the media coverage of cruelty and integrity issues, fully aired the ABC claims and led our paper with the industry\u2019s response. \u201cI am more than comfortable with how the Herald Sun covers racing issues, both on and off the track.\u201d Mayne also called for TattsBet (the parent company of the TAB) and News Corp to \u201ccome clean about the scope and extent of their close commercial relationship\u201d. \u201cBy running 122 pages of racing and gambling industry content in the three days to Monday, the Herald Sun has shown itself to be completely captured by gambling/racing interests and tone deaf on where community sentiment is shifting on the animal cruelty question.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
