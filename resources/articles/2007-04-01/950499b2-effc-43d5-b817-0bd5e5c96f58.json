He has authorised the deployment of \"voice risk analysis\" software to help council staff spot bogus claimants who contact benefit centres by telephone. The technology - already used by the insurance industry - can detect slight changes in a caller's voice which may indicate they are lying. It will be on trial from next month in Harrow, north London, before being rolled out to job centres. Callers will hear a recorded message explaining the scheme before being put through to a benefit officer trained in behavioural risk analysis. At the start, the characteristics of a claimant's voice frequency will be recorded to establish a benchmark, ensuring general nervousness or shyness does not trigger the lie alert. Claimants identified as potential liars will be subjected to closer cross-questioning. Mr Hutton said: \"This technology aims to tackle fraudsters while speeding up claims and improving customer service for the honest majority. We have already made massive reductions in benefit fraud, cutting it by nearly two thirds since 2001. But we still need to do more.\" David Ashton, deputy leader of Harrow council, said: \"This scheme will let us process the majority of claimants who are bona fide more quickly and look more closely at those who potentially seek to defraud the borough.\" According to government figures, the amount lost through benefit fraud fell from about \u00a32bn in 2001 to \u00a3700m in 2005-06. David Laws, the Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman, said: \"This sounds like yet another government gimmick ... If the government really wants to reduce the amount of fraud in the system, then it must tackle the complexity of benefits such as tax and pension credits.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
