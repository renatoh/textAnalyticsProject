Joachim has agreed to sacrifice his appearance bonuses in an attempt to win back the affections of Gary McAllister and he may have succeeded following his efforts in creating the player-manager's opening goal. The diminutive striker was deemed surplus to requirements by McAllister in the summer as one of the club's highest earners. But last night his energetic appearance as a substitute invigorated his team's lacklustre display and his sublime cross led to McAllister's simple header. \"Julian gave us a spark and he has now shown me that he still wants to play for this football club,\" said McAllister. \"He has agreed to waive his appearance bonuses, which is a substantial amount of money, but that just shows what he is about. \"All credit to the guy because he's been determined to remain a Coventry player. If he can keep his concentration he could be an important part of our season.\" Andy Morrell made sure of the points for Coventry 17 minutes from time with a simple glancing header from Youssef Safri's free-kick. It was hard not to feel sympathy for the visitors, who hit the woodwork three times. Crewe have now failed to win or find the net in the absence of their manager Dario Gradi, who is still convalescing in hospital after undergoing heart surgery. Crewe's midfielder Kenny Lunt struck the post twice with two exquisite free-kicks and Steve Jones flicked the ball against a post. \"The team seem to be accepting they can only get a draw when we go 1-0 down, and that isn't good enough,\" said Gradi's temporary replacement, Neil Baker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
