Wales wanted the roof shut and expected Jones to agree but after waiting until just minutes before the 48-hour deadline, he refused to grant Rob Howley\u2019s side their wish. Jones had previously said he did not care if the roof was open or not. \u201cThe louder it is, the better it is. We\u2019ll toss a coin and see what happens,\u201d he said after the win against France on Saturday. By Thursday his tune had changed, even if he claimed the delay in informing Wales was because of how low the roof was on his list of priorities. Asked if he wanted the roof closed to test his players, which was the suggestion earlier in the week, he said: \u201cI want to test them but I want to win.\u201d After England were thrashed 30-3 in 2013, when Stuart Lancaster had asked for the roof to be closed, he then ensured it was open during the 21-16 victory two years ago. England\u2019s record is significantly better when the roof is open but Jones said he has been more preoccupied with the \u201cshenanigans\u201d that await his side. \u201cOur priorities this week are to get to ourselves physically right, psychologically right,\u201d he said. \u201cSelection\u2019s been difficult. They\u2019ve been major priorities for me and I haven\u2019t sat at night thinking about whether the roof should be open or closed. We\u2019re prepared to win. We\u2019re prepared for any shenanigans that might go on. We\u2019re bloody excited about playing there. It\u2019s a great opportunity to play in one of the great stadiums of the world.\u201d The message from Jones is clear. He has named Maro Itoje and Jack Clifford as his flankers, with Nathan Hughes continuing at No8 \u2013 a trio who between them can list only four international starts in the back row \u2013 but he will not accept his side buckling in the face of the Cardiff cauldron as in 2013. Jones said: \u201cSome of our players have never played at Principality Stadium. We\u2019ve encouraged the interaction between the players on what you have to do to cope. \u201cRugby is the main sport [in Wales] and the support is absolutely fever pitch. Rugby means such a lot. You go to those places and you feel that need to win, that urgency to want to win and to dismantle the opposition.\u201d While daffodils being thrown for 15 minutes is as unlikely as the \u201coscillating roof\u201d that Jones has anticipated with tongue in cheek, this fixture has been littered with off-field flashpoints. There is the notorious tale of the Welsh fan butting the England bus and two years ago Chris Robshaw\u2019s refusal to be kept waiting ensured a stand-off in the tunnel before kick-off. \u201cYou go to the hotel and unless you do things, players get rung incessantly through the night,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThose things happen. You go to the ground and the traffic controller drives slower than the traffic\u2019s going to make sure you\u2019re late. You get to the ground and there\u2019s something wrong with your dressing room \u2013 there\u2019s lights off or the heater\u2019s switched off. This week\u2019s been a great learning experience for the team in understanding that. Whatever we do on Saturday, we\u2019ll be better for it.\u201d While Jones\u2019s late decision on the roof may yet light the touchpaper, there has been little in the way of an exchange of words between the sides this year. BBC Wales endured embarrassment on Thursday when appearing to remove a widely criticised promotional video from social media. During the trailer a series of blank faces were shown after a number of Wales fans were asked: \u201cWhat is good about England?\u201d Dylan Hartley is confident Joe Marler will handle the occasion of his first appearance against Wales since he was banned for two matches and fined \u00a320,000 for calling Samson Lee a \u201cGypsy boy\u201d in the reverse fixture last March. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of rugby played since then. Joe\u2019s matured incredibly, his role within our team, I\u2019ve seen him step up incredibly well,\u201d the England captain said. \u201cHis leadership off the field has increased as well, he\u2019s definitely huge for us in that area.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
