I'll be discussing a different 'thought for the week' topic while reflecting on my favourite goals and dark horse players and/or managers to keep an eye on. There will be quite a bit of concentration on the Championship but I hope, from time to time, to delve into the lower divisions and trust you will help highlight significant results, trends etc. Please let us know about your favourite goals, performances and any quirky little anecdotes regarding life outside the Premier League. It's impossible for me to be completely au fait with everything that's going on, to know precisely who is hot and who is not, so your input will be gratefully appreciated Thought for the week Ipswich Town's slow start to the season \u2013 they have a just one point and are second bottom of the Championship \u2013 has already got the \"surely it's about time Roy Keane walked out\" jokes going. Maybe we shouldn't write Sunderland's former manager off just yet, though. After all, back in 2006 he inherited a Wearside side who'd lost their opening four league games of the season under Niall Quinn's stewardship and still steered Sunderland into the Premier League at the first attempt. Yet whereas at the Stadium of Light, Keane proved very much a cheque-book manager, he's been strangely slow to spend at Portman Road. Judging by his latest outburst that might change. \"There are one or two players who played for me against West Brom on Saturday (Ipswich lost) who will never play for me again,\" the former Manchester United captain told journalists on Monday. \"I don't like what I'm seeing. We will not win automatic promotion.\" Oh dear. As a reporter who covers Sunderland regularly I was previously a fascinated Keane watcher and \u2013 although, as I've said it's ridiculously early in the season and bad starts can be overcome \u2013 what worries me with Ipswich is that his policy of ruling by fear brought instant results on Wearside before ultimately going horribly wrong. If such intimidatory tactics aren't working from the off in Suffolk does he have a Plan B? And has he learnt that running away at the first sign of trouble \u2013 see Saipan and Sunderland \u2013 isn't exactly courageous? I do hope so. At least one Ipswich player has already proved capable of wrong-footing him. \"Roy Keane was shocked when I told him I was retiring,\" said ex-Portman Road goalkeeper Shane Supple, 22. \"But there are other things in life. Football's not what I thought it was.\" Wouldn't you just love to have been a fly on that wall? My favourite goal It wasn't the weekend's best \u2013 and I'm sure there'll be plenty of weeks when it might go to Cardiff's Michael Chopra \u2013 but I'm giving it to a player we may not see at this level again. Ever. Tuncay. Middlesbrough's Turkey international will surely be heading back to the Premier League or somewhere in Europe within the next few days. So let's savour his strike in the 2-0 win against Doncaster. Registered almost immediately after Tuncay replaced the injured Marvin Emnes it was an accomplished, clinical finish which looked far easier than it really was. When Leroy Lita flicked on Mark Yeates's long throw, the composed Turk's perfectly calibrated shot gave Gareth Southgate's the lead. Boro will miss him. Who to watch out for Jermaine Johnson, Sheffield Wednesday. The term 'jet heeled' was probably invented for the Wednesday forward \u2013 who also menaces from wide and can deliver a mean cross. Although his side lost, Johnson's pace fazed Newcastle at St James' Park last Wednesday and the \u00a310m Argentinian international centre half Fabricio Coloccini simply could not live with him. Wednesday try to pass the ball nicely, possess a clever midfielder in Darren Potter and, providing Brian Laws can get Francis Jeffers \u2013 remember the fox in the box? \u2013 going again, they could do well this season. Their weekend 4-0 dispatch of Scunthrope United may not have been a flash in the pan. Predictions for midweek/weekend surprises in the Carling Cup Newcastle are going very well under Chris Hughton but they will field a weakened side against a lively Huddersfield Town from League One, now managed by Lee Clark who will want to impress back on his old St James' Park stamping ground. Spurs too have enjoyed a great start to the season. They are at Championship Doncaster where Sean O'Driscoll has performed miracles on a tight budget. John Ryan, Doncaster's chairman, dubs the purist former Bournemouth boss 'the new Ars\u00e8ne Wenger' so maybe this is south Yorkshire's answer to Arsenal v Tottenham? Then there's Peterborough v Ipswich \u2013 or Darren Ferguson v Roy Keane. And last but not least Cardiff v Bristol Rovers. Dave Jones's Championship-topping side - we'll be looking at them closely in future weeks \u2013 cantered to a 3-0 victory against Bristol City at the weekend so Rovers will doubtless be hoping Jones is \"concentrating on the League.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
