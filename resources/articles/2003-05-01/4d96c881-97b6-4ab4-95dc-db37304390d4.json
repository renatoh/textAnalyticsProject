The team will be confined to the athletes' village throughout the 17 days and many will be flown home straight after their events. The Australian Olympic Committee's decision has caused outrage in Greece, where the $1bn security operation is being led by the former New South Wales police commissioner Peter Ryan. Some 50,000 police are expected to be on duty. \"Nobody will attack a place that has thousands of police on duty ... it's crazy,\" said the public order minister Michalis Chrysohoidis. \"We can guarantee their safety.\" The AOC, which has hired a counter-terrorism specialist to travel with the team, may have difficulty stopping its squad enjoying themselves. \"If there is a party to go to then the athletes will find a way to go to it,\" said the trap shooter Russell Mark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
