We have won a world cup and you can never take that away from us.\" The shining silver trophy sat on the table in front of Collingwood as he spoke, still dripping champagne. The satisfaction was particularly rich as this is the first world title England have won despite reaching four previous one-day finals. Their thrashing of Australia was stylish but Collingwood said that barely mattered. \"We just wanted to win, as simple as that. It doesn't matter how ugly you look or how good your luck. We thoroughly deserve the victory because of the way we have played throughout the tournament.\" Alongside the world cup was Kevin Pietersen's trophy for player of the tournament. Pietersen, who scored 47 runs to follow his match-winning innings against Sri Lanka in the semi-finals, was quick to thank his team for the support they gave him when his form slumped in the winter. \"Moments like this you have got to savour. But if it wasn't for the help given me by all the dressing room and the coaching staff and the management in Bangladesh, I wouldn't have been here batting like I did. Player of the series is just something that gets given to one person but the team is the most important. One person gets a lovely trophy but, if it is not for the team, I would not be sitting here.\" \u2022 Mike Selvey: Australia were not just beaten, they were annihilated \u2022 Vic Marks: England have learnt to make their own luck \u2022 On the blog: Andy Bull on KP's crucial contribution \u2022 In pictures: the best images of England's triumph in Barbados \u2022 Rob Smyth's OBO: 'Fantastic scenes of pure, childlike joy' Pietersen's contribution here capped a remarkable seven days which began when he flew back to England to be with his wife for the the birth of his first child. \"I reckon probably in the next week or so when I get back to England and I have my little boy to see and to hold, everything will sink in. Right now it is incredible. We will go back to the dressing room and celebrate.\" For the moment his thoughts are not on the Ashes but the ash. \"Hopefully the ash cloud will stay away and we can get back to all our families on Tuesday because it is one thing celebrating with the lads, but you also want your family around at such a special time.\" Craig Kieswetter, who won man of the match for his top score of 63, described it as \"a dream come true\". For the moment the team will be lost in their celebrations. \"We're not going to get carried away,\" said Collingwood, before thinking again: \"Well, we are going to for the next couple of days. We are going to savour this moment and enjoy it because we deserve to. But good teams kick on and that is what will be drilled into the guys.\" Collingwood thinks his team can get better yet. \"We've got a lot more potential as well and that is the scary part about it. But this is what we came here to achieve and this is what we have done.\" Collingwood continued: \"Our belief has been a huge thing. The guys have played a brand of cricket that is unlike England in the past and a lot of credit goes to every player in the dressing room to go out there and have no regrets and give it a shot. There are guys who have come into this squad and made a name for themselves, Craig, Mike Lumb and Mike Yardy, guys who nobody would have known when we came into this tournament and they have performed exceptionally well.\" Australia's defeated captain, Michael Clarke, was magnanimous. \"We all knew we had to be at our best to beat England. The start we got off to certainly didn't help. Us losing those three wickets put a lot of pressure on our middle-order but we did well to scrape to 140-odd. It was probably 30 short but in saying that the way England came out and batted we were probably 50 runs short. England have played wonderful cricket, you have got to give credit where credit is due. They outplayed us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
