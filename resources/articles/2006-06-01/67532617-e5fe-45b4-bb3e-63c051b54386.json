The coach of the Asian champions will be facing his nation of his birth - for whom he played at three World Cups - but even though the 2002 world champions are favourites to collect their third success in the tournament's history, the Japan team will go into the game in a positive frame of mind. \"We have hope,\" Zico said yesterday. \"We have a difficult situation now but we are going to go for a victory and then just see what happens. Of course you have to respect Brazil. I respect the team and the players. They won 1-0 against Croatia and [yet] they could have conceded a goal. Our matches were quite similar and it is what happens on the pitch that matters. \"We are still here with a chance and if we leave the tournament we will leave it with our heads held high.\" Japan faced Brazil in the final group match of the Confederations Cup in Germany last summer and drew 2-2 with Carlos Alberto Parreira's team, who went on to win the trophy. They need to go one better on Thursday and claim three points if they are to match their feat of four years ago and reach the knockout phase after losing their opening game to Australia and then drawing with Croatia. Zico will at least be happier with the kick-off time against Brazil as the game will start at 9pm local time. He complained vociferously that his side's first two matches were played in the blistering mid-afternoon sun to accommodate television schedules back in Japan. His thoughts were echoed by the West Bromwich midfielder Junichi Inamoto: \"The next game is in the evening so I don't think it will be as taxing.\" But he feared that Brazil may turn on the style belatedly in their final group game. \"Maybe Brazil will have hit their top form for the third game so it will be very difficult. We will just go for a win.\" Croatia's coach Zlatko Kranjcar, meanwhile, is still trying to find a way to end his strikers' drought after watching his team fail to score for the second game in a row. Darijo Srna saw his penalty saved by Japan's former Portsmouth goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi, and Niko Kranjcar hit the bar. Just as in their meeting with Brazil, Croatia finished without a goal to their name and now need to beat the Australians to reach the last 16. \"We will be really focused on this game as well, just as we were against Brazil and Japan,\" said the coach. \"We can do a bit more in training to work on our concentration and calmness in front of goal. In the last two friendlies and in the last two matches here our strikers have not scored and they are feeling the pressure, so I have to talk to them and assure them that they don't have to feel the pressure.\" The France and Liverpool striker Djibril Ciss\u00e9 should return to Africa to seek traditional healing after a broken leg stopped him from playing in the World Cup, according to his father. \"I think he should turn to his roots to get his form back and to be at peace with himself. We are Africans and there are things known only to us,\" Mangue Ciss\u00e9 said yesterday. Traditional healing is deeply rooted in West African culture and many people believe that wearing a talisman called a \"gris-gris\" protects them from bullets, knives, plane crashes, and from even getting pregnant. Ciss\u00e9, who is from Ivory Coast, missed the Euro 2004 tournament due to injuries and missed this year's World Cup after he broke his leg during a warm-up game against China a day before his team left for Germany. \"You should recognise that he has a lot of problems and the solution can be found here in Africa, notably in Ivory Coast close to his family,\" added his father, who played football for Arles in the French second division. A thief who stole a woman's ticket was arrested after taking her place in the stadium - next to her husband. Munich police said the stolen ticket was in a handbag that was snatched from the woman as she made her way to Sunday's game between Brazil and Australia. \"The audacious thief found the ticket and sat down in her place,\" they said in a statement. \"However, the victim's husband then sat next to him in the stadium and alerted the police, who arrested the man.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
