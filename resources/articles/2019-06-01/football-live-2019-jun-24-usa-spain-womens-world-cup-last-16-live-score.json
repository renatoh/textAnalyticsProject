Oh my, the mailbox exploded. A few highlights ... Michael Konopka: \u201cIf VAR has shown anything, it\u2019s a strict adherent to the letter of the law, even if by a millimeter of distance or millinewton of force being applied when kicking an opponent.\u201d Mario S: \u201cHopefully the US will score at least one goal not through a penalty shot otherwise the critics will all claim the US should not have won.\u201d Even then, that call changed the game, and Spain had to chase from there. (Not effectively.) Michael Waechter: \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Jill Ellis sent in Press and Pugh? Our left wing is useless (except for taking (undeserved) penalties).\u201d Jeff McCrum: \u201cSpain is getting away with murder here, the ref has zero respect from them.\u201d Joe Pearson: \u201cCorredera and Rapinoe swapping shirts was a nice touch\u201d Eric Gordon: \u201cCould someone please explain to me why USA and France have ended up in a predictable quarter final showdown .. and not the semis .. were they not both convincing top four favourites from the get go \u2026. So , now either the hostesses or the Legion of doom go out \u2026. Not that as a Canadian I\u2019m really complaining ..\u201d It\u2019s not seeded, and this is an idiosyncrasy of the 24-team field. That said, if you have 32 teams, you may have even more group winners playing in the quarterfinals. Courtney Shin: \u201cWanted to throw in my two cents that despite the controversy of that last penalty call, Rose Lavelle has proven herself a necessary force for her team. She had some peaches of passes, and her and Sam Mewis were clear US standouts for me. All this to say that Spain had an incredible, incredible game. I can only hope the US bring the same level of verve, intensity, and commitment to their next game against France. And maybe a few less fouls.\u201d Twitter is decidedly split on the penalty call. Most worrying for the USA -- no goals from the run of play, and they didn\u2019t even force a difficult save. But neither did Spain -- the goal was really their one good chance. For the neutral, that was awesome. For US fans, that was torture. And the next three games might be the same way. Thanks for following along with me. Check here for the match report shortly. Positives for the USA ... 1. While Rapinoe and Morgan struggled, the latter because of some intense and sometimes illegal defensive attention, Tobin Heath was excellent. 2. On the few times the Spanish attack went down the left flank, Kelley O\u2019Hara promptly stopped it. 3. Rose Lavelle played terrific through balls. 4. After her early mistake, Alyssa Naeher controlled her box very well and distributed with no problems. 5. Abby Dahlkemper, the less experienced half of the center back tandem, made several important clearances. 6. Samantha Mewis was an imposing force in central midfield and played the ball forward quite well, perfectly complementing the reliable Julie Ertz and the playmaker Lavelle. The tactics were bizarre at times. Crystal Dunn is a fantastic player, but when you\u2019re protecting a 2-1 lead and she has been repeatedly beaten, why would you not sub for her? Perhaps because Casey Short, a true left back, wasn\u2019t on the bench? But they survive and advance. And France look anything but immortal. Let\u2019s finish up on the controversy, then get to the positives for the USA ... There was contact. There was not enough to make someone fall down. The word \u201ctrifling\u201d is part of the referees\u2019 vocabulary. Final comment: All that said, it was a poor game all the way around for the VAR crew. They could have reviewed a few more incidents in each box, and if Spain hadn\u2019t delayed the penalty, that call might not have been reviewed at all. Now on to the positives ... It was more controversial than convincing, but let\u2019s count the reasons the USA deserve this result ... 1. More possession. 2. A defense that took the edge off most of Spain\u2019s chances after that early goal. 3. As soft as the second penalty call was, some other Spanish fouls went uncalled. So now a quarterfinal between two favorites, the USA and France, who looked far from dominant in the round of 16. 90+8 min: Spain try to switch fields, but the impatient Caldentey takes it at midfield. Finally a long ball into the box ... Paredes is down seeking a call. We\u2019ve seen no indication of a VAR intrusion, not even after the ball is out of play. 90+7 min: Rapinoe, with her last kick, puts the ball out of play. Press comes in to replace her, and Rapinoe exits on the far sideline in accordance with the new Laws of the Game. 90+6 min: Ertz has dropped from defensive mid to the center of defense. Rapinoe is fouled by Corredera and takes some time to adjust her socks. No question about the foul. Christen Press is warming up. Naeher clears the ball long. 90+5 min: You\u2019d think Ellis would slow things down and use her third sub. Not at the moment, while the USA keep possession down the left flank for a good long time. 90+4 min: Dahlkemper with another vital interception. Replay shows Paredes wasn\u2019t fouled on the prior play. NOW the US defense are passing the test. 90+3 min: Long ball to Paredes, who has run up from center back into the box. She tumbles. Ref isn\u2019t interested. 90+2 min: O\u2019Hara slides cleanly to stop a counterattack. Dahlkemper heads a cross clear. Spain really haven\u2019t had a promising attack in some time. 90+1 min: Heath falls on the right side. Spanish player motions for her to get up. Replay shows ... maybe impeding? 90 min: Lloyd gets the ball and is rather ridiculous taken out. That\u2019ll only hurt Spain. A replay shows an arm around Rapinoe\u2019s neck on a previous play. We\u2019re getting seven minutes of stoppage time, much of it surely for the VAR review. 89 min: Sandra Pa\u00f1os holds the ball despite a collision. No foul, which is probably the right (no-)call. 88 min: Heath earns a corner, and Horan replaces Lavelle. THAT is a sensible substitution, as long as Horan doesn\u2019t pick up a yellow. Should be more. 87 min: Lloyd\u2019s first contribution to this game is an offside call. Replay shows the call probably wasn\u2019t right. Lloyd is one of the two or three best clutch scorers the USA have ever had. This is not the situation for that. 85 min: Dunn and Rapinoe win the ball from three Spanish players, one of whom falls. Paredes responds by wiping out Rapinoe and getting a yellow. And now Lloyd comes in for Morgan, which makes no sense whatsover. A speedy counterattacker, OK. That\u2019s not Lloyd. 82 min: Correction -- the third Spanish sub is coming in now, with Caldenty replacing the goal-scorer Hermoso. Or not. Torrecilla is down, and she\u2019s the one who\u2019ll come out. The previous sub was Falcon for Putellas. Meanwhile, while straining to protect a 2-1 lead, the USA turn to ... Carli Lloyd. I don\u2019t want to live on this planet any more. 80 min: We still have a good game in progress. Rapinoe goes close from a tough angle. Naeher punches clear in a tough collision. Morgan clears the ensuing corner. Spain have made three subs now. The USA have made none. If ever there was a time to bring in another defender. Roger Wallace: \u201cAs a US fan I hope they overturn this penalty. I think there have been a ton of fouls that should have been called on Spain, but this would just leave a bad taste in the mouth for everyone. So soft\u201d Henry Flory: \u201cEnjoying the commentary, but \u201canti-homer\u201d sounds right, if you\u2019re going to call it a dive at least wait for one replay showing an absence of cleat-to-shin contact?\u201d I\u2019ve seen the replay. Lavelle went flying. Roger Theberge says there was contact but it was soft. Tom Wahl: \u201cYou\u2019re doing your job right when a homer accuses you of being anti-homer. Keep up the fair and open minded critique. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of these fans who think the women\u2019s team can do no wrong.\u201d Thanks. I look forward to being burned in effigy on Twitter later this afternoon. The view from Canada: The penalty is given after review. The ref tells Rapinoe to move the ball back onto the spot. Nearly saved but not quite. She went the same way as her first. Keeper guessed correctly, but it\u2019s a low hard shot. This game is now officially controversial. Twitter is divided ... Christina Unkel (Fox rules expert) says there was contact. Aly Wagner says Lavelle\u2019s leg didn\u2019t move. Spain does everything they can to delay the penalty, and with good reason. The VAR crew takes a full two minutes to awaken from their slumber and alert the referee. It\u2019s a great game, folks. Wake up. 70 min: When will we see a sub? I like the term \u201canti-homer,\u201d by the way. Graavarg says the USA lead the world in unsportsmanlike conduct. And right on cue, Lavelle dives for a penalty. If this stands, that\u2019s a robbery. Comments: Henry Flory: \u201cIf I were to sub in an American attacker, I\u2019d tell whomever is coming on to give something back to the Spanish CBs, who have been pretty damn rough, especially #4. Since the very opening, when Morgan was knocked down twice off the ball, it\u2019s been non-stop. I suppose, if you\u2019re someone who believes Barca\u2019s dominance is built on a foundation of cynical fouls and dramatic falls, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised...\u201d I think the USA have taken some dramatic fall. Joe Pearson: \u201cStop being such an anti-homer. Morgan is being fouled whenever she even gets near the ball. Spain is playing very cynically and daring the ref to make the calls. She is bottling it.\u201d Feedback noted. Mario S: \u201cI have a bad feeling that the US is going to start pressing too hard. They are missing shots they should be making and Spain is going to get a breakaway with US defenders up in the wrong box.\u201d Quite possible. Paul G. Frazer: \u201cjust have to say, if alex morgan is really struggling, shouldn\u2019t she be subbed?? I am a bit worried about this one,\u201d You\u2019re not alone. On Rapinoe: Brilliant career, but she\u2019s flailing here. Naeher collects a cross and boots it to the other box. Heath was within 20 yards, but that wasn\u2019t dangerous. 65 min: The international broadcast shows Hope Solo again after that play. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but Solo didn\u2019t play left back. And now Mewis goes somewhat close with a long-range shot. I need a hydration break. 63 min: CHANCE FOR SPAIN! Dunn is beaten again, and Guijarro gets a cross/shot past Ertz and Naeher that barely slides past the far post. Mailbag ... Roger Theberge wants the US to shoot while the sun is in the Spanish keeper\u2019s eyes. Not a bad idea, and they\u2019ve done so twice in the last few minutes. 61 min: Garcia slides past Dahlkemper down the left and cuts the ball back to the top of the box. The only person there is Ertz, who is not on Garcia\u2019s team. Isn\u2019t it supposed to be hot? This is end-to-end and frenetic. I\u2019m trying to get to the mailbag, but this game is too fast! 60 min: CHANCE FOR USA! Rose Lavelle\u2019s 22-yarder just goes over the bar. 59 min: More passes in the US half than we\u2019re used to seeing, and Mewis ends up charging forward with the ball. Spain win it, and Ertz slips on a challenge and wins a foul. Please show more replays of these. Fair enough. If I may backtrack a little -- Rapinoe is one of those players who can destroy a team in an instant. But if that doesn\u2019t happen soon, will Ellis go to the bench. Probably not. 56 min: Now THAT\u2019S a foul. Paredes slides through O\u2019Hara on the edge of the box. And the ref ignores it. 55 min: CHANCE FOR USA! They played the ball to Heath! Lavelle sends it to her, and Heath shoots from a tough angle just over the bar. 54 min: Naeher is up to the challenge with a strong punch in traffic. And Morgan falls again. If these are legitimate fouls, we\u2019re long overdue for persistent infringement. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a foul. Morgan swings an arm first. 53 min: Free kick to the USA as Morgan tumbles again, this time a bit too easily for my taste. Look, if you\u2019re going to say Corredera fell too easily on the Rapinoe slap, well ... The USA lose possession and concede a corner. 50 min: The ref apparently missed a couple of off-the-ball fouls, including one in the box. Heath is hurt for a moment as she and Virginia Torrecilla slide into a challenge simultaneously. Now Morgan is down, and Jill Ellis really should take her out. 48 min: Rapinoe and Corredera renew their 1v1 battle. This round to Corredera. Apparently, the USA weren\u2019t listening to me when I reminded them that there\u2019s a right flank on the field, and Tobin Heath is there. 47 min: I\u2019m going to be chuckling for a while at all the Fox commentators and analysts in a state of disbelief over the current state of this game. Fox already had to broadcast a men\u2019s World Cup with no US team. Imagine if this game goes awry. 46 min: No subs mentioned. The USA get a free kick from ... call it 35 yards. Or 30 meters. Heath takes it, which is not her strong suit, and Paredes clears with ease. Agreed. Disagreed on Lloyd, who\u2019s basically a goal-poacher at this stage of her career. She\u2019s not going to break down the defense in the middle of the field. If I end up eating those words, fine. I didn\u2019t have much for lunch. Armchair US tactician says ... 1. Get the ball to Heath early. She\u2019ll create the goal to break the Spanish resistance. 2. Consider bringing in Tierna Davidson at left back and moving Crystal Dunn up the field, replacing either Rose Lavelle in the midfield or (ducks from Twitterati who think that if Megan Rapinoe says the sky is green, then it\u2019s green) Megan Rapinoe up front. 3. It\u2019s not happening for Alex Morgan today. Pick any forward to come in. Best players of the half: USA: Mewis has more than justified her inclusion here, bossing the midfield and playing sharp balls forward. Heath has been brilliant every time she\u2019s seen the ball -- maybe Jill Ellis should be telling the team to get the ball to her more often instead of assuming Rapinoe will always do something brilliant on the left. Spain: Brilliant finish from Hermoso, but Garcia has been the persistent danger. Paredes also deserves credit for bottling up the center of the defense. Mailbag! Paul Thompson (the guitarist?): \u201cThat was incredibly lazy on the US part, and an evidence of incredibly poor preparation. If a defender cannot handle the pressure in this situation, the preparation for the match was extremely lax.\u201d It was an appalling decision from Naeher to play that ball. Roger Wallace: \u201cI know it\u2019s probably near sacrilege to say this, but despite the penalty Rapinoe has been just about the worst player on the pitch so far this game to my eye. Undisciplined several times, losing the ball or wasting excellent balls from Lavelle or others many times, horrible shot. If I were the U.S. I\u2019d get Press or Pugh in there at the first opportunity.\u201d Hmmm. I don\u2019t think I can agree with that, but it\u2019s funny that the ball was rarely on the far side of the field. Tobin Heath has seen little of the ball aside from winning the penalty, and Kelley O\u2019Hara has had naught to do because Spain simply haven\u2019t attacked down that flank. Joe Pearson: \u201cNever in my life have I been slapped so hard that I fell down. Seems to happen to footballers all the time.\u201d That\u2019s just because the refs can\u2019t see everything. Gotta draw attention somehow! The score is no fluke. The USA have had more possession, but Spain have asked many questions of the US defense, and they don\u2019t have good answers. Off to the restroom and the fridge, and I\u2019ll be right back to argue with all of you from Twitter and the mailbag. (No, no -- I appreciate all of you.) 45+2 min: Morgan is fouled 25 yards out. Irene Paredes disagrees. Rapinoe and Morgan lobby for a yellow, more likely for persistent infringement than that foul alone. Refs never give persistent infringement, and they should. The US play the free kick to perfection, with several players racing unimpeded toward the goal, but Rapinoe\u2019s delivery is poorly weighted. 45 min: Better from Dunn, who takes the ball to the outside under pressure and wins a foul. We\u2019ll have three minutes of stoppage time, which will surely irk Spanish supporters. 44 min: Rapinoe\u2019s corner is dangerous, but Sandra Pa\u00f1os punches it well, and the USA can\u2019t control. Goal kick. The foul call was certainly just -- yes, Twitter, it was. The yellow might have been harsh. I miss Sam\u2019s Army. Meanwhile, Corredera is beaten in the corner by Mewis, whose cross is blocked out for a corner. Virginia Torrecilla took the brunt of it and is down. 40 min: Spain have the ball down the right, and the cross bounces in front of Naeher and, fortunately for US fans, bounds over the head of Alexia Putellas. Did we warn you that this might be a tough game? Didn\u2019t we? 38 min: Spain show intent, and Lucia Garcia has been a handful. Dahlkemper has to block a shot in the box, and Naeher alertly grabs a ball over the top to the onrushing forward-ish player. The crowd may not like it, but even Megan Rapinoe isn\u2019t allowed to slap a defender in the face, which is what she did to Marta Corredera. Rapinoe sportingly smiles and offers what appears to be an apology. 36 min: Rapinoe and Mewis take turns taking inconsequential worm-burners from 25 yards that go well wide. There -- here\u2019s your Hermoso goal ... Mailbag: Stephen Holliday rightly takes me to task for focusing on the US error rather than Hermoso\u2019s brilliant lob. Also, Kyle Brown writes: \u201cA Guardian commentary a few days back mentioned the US playing the rare 0-0-10. Are they at that again today?\u201d No, Kyle, you are wrong. It\u2019s a 1-0-9, with Sauerbrunn back. 30 min: Rapinoe hits the ground on what appeared to be no contact whatsoever. Play on, says our ref. Garcia gets the ball with roughly 40 yards of space in any direction. Her cross is collected by Naeher under a strong challenge. Alex Morgan is down at midfield, and Spain are making a sub. It\u2019s the luckless Losada, who was banged up earlier on a play we haven\u2019t seen again. She\u2019s in tears as Nahikari Garc\u00eda comes in. 28 min: And again, the US defense have a nervy moment. The ball is played over the top to Garcia, who races past the US defense. Naeher has to collect it on her chest just outside the box. Oh dear. Spain again send it through down the right, but the excellent Sauerbrunn interposes her body and wins it back to Naeher, who actually has time to play it this time. 27 min: More shakiness on the US backline, as Dunn plays a hospital ball back to Naeher near the side of the box. Her initial clearance clangs into an onrushing attacker, but they clean up. 25 min: Dunn commits a foul, and it\u2019s a free kick to the USA. OK, then. It\u2019s cleverly taken to Mewis, who\u2019s sprinting out of the center toward the left. Kelley O\u2019Hara (right back) passes in the box to Julie Ertz (defensive midfield) who shoots over the bar. Where, exactly, are the forwards supposed to go if the defense is 15 yards from the Spanish goal? Art Levy writes: \u201cProud team USA supporter here, but it doesn\u2019t feel right that Losada looks like she\u2019s going to need Mickey to cut her, and we haven\u2019t seen a view of Apollo Mewis\u2019 clocking her.\u201d It\u2019s OK -- the domestic commentary team assures us it was an accident. We believe them, right? Meanwhile, a stat on the screen says the USA lead in passes, 95-37. 23 min: Now Spain have the ball ... oh, wait, no they don\u2019t, and Lavelle runs straight down the middle. Ball is played out. If it makes you feel better, it\u2019s past 6 pm in Spain. It\u2019s stunning how often this happens at major events. Except in Beijing. 19 min: Rapinoe wins the ball, Mewis plays to the eagerly overlapping Dunn, whose dangerous cross goes through to Spain\u2019s relief. It\u2019s safe to say Spain have not established their possession-based game here. 17 min: Quick free kick, another slippery run from Heath, and Rapinoe and Morgan each get a half-chance. 16 min: Morgan isn\u2019t seeing much of the ball in the center, but Rapinoe is giving experienced right-back Marta Corredera all sorts of fits. Abby Dahlkemper shoots/plays the ball from Carli Lloyd 2015 range, but Sandra Pa\u00f1os easily catches in mild traffic. 13 min: CHANCE FOR USA! Take THAT, Rose Lavelle haters. A gorgeous through ball gives Rapinoe a close-range shot. It\u2019s saved but might have been going wide anyway -- the purple-haired veteran should\u2019ve done better. Looks pretty full at the moment. Jill Ellis and company are looking at a tablet on the sideline while trainers tend to Vicky Losada, who got the worst of a collision with Mewis. And the US defense flunks its first real test. Naeher plays the ball to Sauerbrunn, who\u2019s already under pressure from Garcia. The ball gets to Spain\u2019s forward Hermoso, who chips it over the out-of-position Naeher. Before you start -- Hope Solo has done that in a major tournament, too. No controversy about any of that. Heath was just too much for Mapi Le\u00f3n, the first player to earn a transfer fee in Spanish women\u2019s soccer. She\u2019s also interested in going into the tattoo business after her playing career. Well, she left a mark on Heath\u2019s leg, but that\u2019s probably not what she meant. Short runup, blistering shot, keeper guesses wrong anyway. 5 min: PENALTY TO USA! Ball played directly from defender Dahlkemper to the ever-dangerous Heath, who cuts the ball back. Mapi Leon left her leg in, tripping Heath, and Rapinoe goes to the spot. Mario S. is annoyed that Fox has not seen fit to interrupt its daytime programming for this game: \u201cI just love that here in the USA our only access to watching US Women play is via pay TV (Fox premium). That\u2019s a great way to build consensus support in the USA. Bah! Humbug!\u201d Technically, Fox Sports 1 is usually available on a sports tier on most cable systems, and it\u2019s part of most streaming services. But the point is well made. 3 min: An early sign of the USA\u2019s aggressive approach -- they win a throw-in deep in Spain\u2019s half. Rapinoe throws it in to Crystal Dunn, who\u2019s theoretically the left back. 1 min: CHANCE FOR SPAIN! Ball played down the left, crossed, not quite cleared, and Guijarro\u2019s shot nails Becky Sauerbrunn in the face. 1 min: And we have a foul call? No, the ball hit the ref. That\u2019s now a dropped ball. Reminder of the lineups ... Spain: Pa\u00f1os, Corredera, Paredes, Le\u00f3n, Ouahabi, Losada, Torrecilla, Guijarro, Lucia Garcia, Hermoso, Putellas USA: Naeher, O\u2019Hara, Dahlkemper, Sauerbrunn, Dunn, Lavelle, Ertz, Mewis, Heath, Morgan, Rapinoe Referee: Katalin Kulcsar (Hungary) . The ARs are from Hungary and Croatia. The VAR crew is from the Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic. By the way, it\u2019s hot. Here we go. Spain\u2019s weakness -- possession without goals As you might expect from a side drawing heavily from Barcelona\u2019s Champions League-contending squad, Spain can possess the ball. The problem is converting all that possession to goals. Spain kicked off Euro 2017 with a 2-0 win over Iberian neighbor Portugal. In their next two group games and a quarterfinal matchup with Austria, Spain had at least 70% of the possession -- including 78% against England -- according to Vavel. In this tournament, Spain opened with a 3-1 win over South Africa. Then 59% of the possession against Germany, to whom they lost 1-0. The offensive stats against China were staggering -- 61% possession, 24 shots to China\u2019s 1, nine shots on goal to China\u2019s 0, eight corner kicks to China\u2019s 0. Final score: 0-0. The draw clinched their spot in the knockout rounds, but still ... Spain\u2019s US ties ... In addition to Losada and Boquete, another Spanish player has had an impact in the USA. Backup defender Celia Jim\u00e9nez played at Iowa Western Community College, then drew plenty of interest from top-level programs. She chose Alabama. Why? Aerospace engineering. The player who\u2019s NOT here Maybe it\u2019s not quite as notable an absence as Ada Hegerberg for Norway, but Spain are playing in this tournament without a legend -- Vero Boquete, so revered in her home country that she has a stadium named after her. Her club career can best be described as \u201cperipatetic.\u201d She has passed through the USA a couple of times, establishing herself in WPS while that league existed, returning for a stint with Portland and now playing for the Utah Royals. But coach Jorge Vilda dumped her from the national team for Euro 2017, and she\u2019s not here this time around. Eleonora Giovio, writing in our team guide: Vilda is always keen to stress the importance of the collective rather than any individual stars and he has not called up Boquete for that reason. Boquete led a player revolt that led to the dismissal of longtime coach Ignacio Querada, which was noted in passing when El Pais reported her absence from the Euro squad. Spain\u2019s stars Supporters might be a little happy to see Vicky Losada in the lineup: Losada started against South Africa but was pulled at halftime. She\u2019s familiar to US fans for her stint with the Western New York Flash. She\u2019s also one of five players who made the 55-player shortlist when FIFPro compiled a World XI list for 2017. The others: Goalkeeper Sandra Pa\u00f1os, who has played the whole way for Spain so far in France Center back Irene Paredes, also ever-present Midfielder Silvia Meseguer, who has played little in this Cup Forward Jennifer Hermoso, by far the leading scorer on this team heading into the Cup and the penalty-taker for Spain here The only US players on that list were Alex Morgan and Carli Lloyd. We\u2019ll leave it to others to say whether the omissions of Rapinoe, Heath, Sauerbrunn et al undermine the credibility of said list. The news here is that Vicky Losada, one of Spain\u2019s star players, starts after playing limited minutes in the group stage. Next, we\u2019ll explain why Spain can beat the USA. Lindsey Horan, a sturdy presence in the U.S. midfield, is not starting. Defensive midfielder Julie Ertz is too vital to omit, but supporters may be surprised to see Samantha Mewis and Rose Lavelle. The reaction is mixed. Goff goes on to point out that Horan has a yellow already, and they don\u2019t want to go without her when they face France. Oops ... if they face France. Can\u2019t take this one for granted. Which explains this reaction ... And this one ... Probably because the only way to do that would be to bench either Megan Rapinoe or Tobin Heath. Or perhaps to shift one of them back to midfield, and then you\u2019re asking Mewis or Lavelle to carry the load at attacking mid, anyway. Untested yet dominant, the USA have stormed into the knockout rounds with a +18 goal difference, no goals conceded and a lot of questions about the defense. None of that makes sense, does it? It\u2019s not the US women\u2019s fault. You can only play who\u2019s in front of you, and in the group stage, the teams in front of them were two overmatched side and a surprisingly toothless Swedish side. Now they face Spain, a side which absolutely has the capacity to cause an upset here. Will we see another nail-biter as we saw with France yesterday? Or another dull rout? Let\u2019s find out. Beau will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s what we can expect today: Alyssa Naeher isn\u2019t exactly one to talk about herself.
