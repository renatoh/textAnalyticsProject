There are 30 million of us men out there, and none of us has won the Gentlemen's Singles at Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936. Gender-shame haunts the land, and it complicates our efforts to separate Murray's mission from the country's 73-year itch. One of the best reasons to get behind him at the All England Club in the next fortnight is that he shows no inclination to get behind us. Murray looks about as comfortable carrying the Fred Perry baggage as Little Britain's Vicky Pollard would as a hotel porter. Britain's No1, you see, displays no urge to wear the Union Flag as a gladiatorial cloak. Maybe he is alive to the hypocrisy of a country that takes virtually no interest in tennis for 50 weeks of the year suddenly dumping such an onerous responsibility on one 22-year-old. All of us men ought to be sheepish. What have we been doing since 1936? In that year, J Lyons and Co Ltd replaced Ring and Brymer as the official Wimbledon caterers, Hitler reoccupied the Rhineland and Perry won the last of his three crowns. People forget that four British women won singles titles between 1937 and 1977, with Virginia Wade the most recent. Females, stand aside. You don't need to be part of this mortification ritual. As national cravings go, Murray's task is right up there with the England football team's failure to reach the final of a tournament since 1966, and eclipses Colin Montgomerie's now-doomed quest to win a major golf title as well as Paula Radcliffe's crusade to win Olympic gold. The 1966 paradox is English sport's most excruciating, of course, but the annual massacre of the Brits on our own lawns has its own special power to humiliate and appal. Murray's discomfort was on full show as he won his first grass-court title, at Queen's, and declined the role of darling to the middle-class and corporate lunch-munchers. He was true to his own need for distance, for privacy. Around the court, as Sue Barker tickled him with her mic, he probably saw only a mania to anoint him as our national saviour when all he wanted to do was kiss his mum and take his entourage for a curry. Tim Henman didn't win Wimbledon. He carried it instead. To confer the same overblown duty on this year's third seed would be to hand him a racket made of lead and a kit-bag full of breeze blocks. He may wear Fred Perry's gear but there is no need to wrap him in the old man's shroud. Should Murray triumph on the newly rain-defying Centre Court on the hundredth anniversary of Perry's birth week we will proclaim it as a specifically British conquest. Men's tennis on these islands will be seen to have marched back in from the wastelands, like Captain Oates, but that is not how the new champion would be obliged to see it. Murray has always been an outsider. Escaping the morass of underachievement and middle-class drift, he fled to Barcelona at 15 to attend the Schiller international school. It was typical of this autonomous spirit that he dumped the American coach (Brad Gilbert) hired for him by the LTA at cringe-inducing expense. In Gilbert's place he assembled a gang of amigos who have formed a protective entourage of kindred spirits. As for the Scottish-British angle, you may as well pogo across a minefield. Murray's jest that he would \"support anyone but England\" at the 2006 World Cup has long since receded into the mists of jokes-gone-wrong, another of our national specialities. If this were an authentic tennis\u2011loving nation he would be under more legitimate duress to assume the redeemer's role. But the game here is still played mainly for recreation rather than advancement. Tennis remains, for us, a sport of private clubs and maladroit duels on courts in parks, followed by a pint or two. We take no interest in the Davis Cup, unlike the real tennis-literate countries. So it's not Murray's problem that one of our most sacred summer rituals always ends with the British as guests at their own garden party. The inquests, which are kept on default keys in newspaper offices, have only intermittently acknowledged Henman's stoicism in lending the whole ruined show a veneer of respectability until the meaner and more macho Murray came along. The one concession he has made to crowd adoration was when he said this week that having \"14,000-15,000 people behind you gets your adrenaline going right from the start\". Over the next two weeks, though, he will know that surges of mob excitement can't be allowed to distort his tactical calculations. He's a man, not a country. He's playing for himself, not them. Five good things about Lions tour 1 As with the Ashes in Australia, trekking across a great southern hemisphere state is a holiday with a narrative. Between games, the swarm of British and Irish rugby nuts swing from safari to coast road to vineyard. Mostly to vineyard. Actual lions are hard to find in the wild, though. They all signed up to do HSBC ads. 2 Legends are made from nowhere. Overnight. Watch John Bentley's try against Gauteng Lions at Ellis Park in 1997 on YouTube. Men reach heights in a Lions jersey denied to them by club and normal international rugby. 3 Trust and co-operation between the English, Welsh, Irish and Scots would be just about impossible in any other field. This time, Ian McGeechan, master of the melting pot, has repaired the damage caused by the over-reliance on faded Englishmen four years ago. 4 The Lions concept offers an escape from money, even with sponsors draped all over this tour, but South Africa, Australia and New Zealand derive huge regeneration revenues from Lions Tests. 5 There is something hugely ludicrous and lovable about a starting XV who had never played together before trying to beat the world champions on their own turf 21 days into a tour. Max and Bernie, your race has been run The BBC must be thrilled with their \u00a3200m, five-year deal to cover Formula One. First they overpaid, then motor racing exploded in their faces with a breakaway. Or rather, our faces, because the big gift to Bernie Ecclestone came from licence-payers' money, which is the kind of why-oh-why sentence I generally try not to write. A cynic might say the proposed eight-team exodus finally provides a decent reason to sit through a modern F1 race, starting with today's British Grand Prix. Civil wars are a lot more compelling than the spectacle motor racing has become, however unfair that sounds to Jenson Button, the star of this year's lopsided show. The cleverest dictators know when to cede power before it is snatched away. But Ecclestone appears not to have read much about the Gorbachev-era Kremlin or apartheid in South Africa. He and Max Mosley are like two irascible granddads determined to defy a younger generation. It's undeniable that their time has passed. At least Ecclestone is defending his money mountain. What was Mosley's motivation for forcing through a budget cap and constantly meddling with the rules? Power? Could it really be that banal? The BBC ought to ask."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
