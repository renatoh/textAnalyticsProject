In its annual trade assistance review, released on Wednesday, the commission also warned the proliferation of government finance facilities \u2013 including for small business and the Pacific \u2013 imposes a risk on taxpayers the federal government has failed to disclose. The review notes rising protectionist sentiment around the world \u2013 with tariffs imposed by the United States on steel and aluminium prompting retaliation from China \u2013 and suggests Australia should respond by maintaining low barriers to trade and investment. While government assistance has fallen in most industries, the Productivity Commission noted it had risen in primary production industries due to \u201cnumerous drought assistance measures\u201d including payments of $12,000 per household and bigger concessional loans. The commission noted it has not reviewed drought programs since 2009, when it found they \u201cacted like implicit insurance (without requiring a premium) and potentially altered the behaviour of some farmers\u201d. It noted that new federal government-funded loan schemes have been introduced despite the earlier finding that concessional loans \u201ccreated a number of perverse incentives and unintended outcomes that made it ineffective in achieving its stated objective of building farmers\u2019 self-reliance to manage climate variability and preparedness for droughts\u201d. The schemes gave farmers an incentive to build or not reduce debt, not to diversify income sources off-farm, and provided a windfall gain and competitive advantage against other businesses, it said. The commission said the government has extended cash grants \u201cout of step with income support available to other Australians\u201d, suggesting they are now \u201cbetter thought of as industry assistance\u201d. Cash grants and state schemes to pay for fodder \u201creduce the incentives for farmers to manage their properties well over climatic cycles and may also reduce the incentives to de-stock during periods of drought\u201d, it said. The Productivity Commission noted since its last annual review the federal government has created a $2bn Australian Business Securitisation Fund to lower the costs of small business borrowing and a $1bn infrastructure lending facility for Pacific Island nations. \u201cWhile individual schemes may, or may not, be worthwhile, they all impose additional risk on the Australian taxpayer that has generally not been made clear,\u201d it said. Government finance vehicles do not hit the federal budget\u2019s bottom line and may therefore \u201cin some cases, lower scrutiny of spending decisions\u201d. In August 2018 \u2013 just months before the government announced the new small business facility \u2013 the commission found that nearly 90% of small to medium enterprises that applied for loans were successful. The Productivity Commission called for further reviews of both drought assistance and new government financing measures. It called on the government to explain \u201cwhy financing is the best policy option\u201d and to demonstrate that the schemes \u201cgenuinely make Australians better off, and that they do not merely benefit project proponents\u201d. The Productivity Commission chairman, Michael Brennan, noted that around the world \u201cwe are seeing the language of market gain give way to the language of strategic rivalry, resulting in unpredictable trade policy\u201d. \u201cThis is bad for business and bad for jobs,\u201d he said. The review attributed the \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in US trade policy due to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, noting his \u201cbravado\u201d has been backed by pulling the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and imposing steel and aluminium tariffs, from which Australia is exempted. \u201cDespite high-profile tensions between our trading partners, Australia has progressed a number of multilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements,\u201d the review said. \u201cYet domestic policy has continued to retreat into protectionism in some areas. Australia has one of the world\u2019s most active \u2018anti-dumping\u2019 regimes, for example.\u201d In total, Australian industry received more than $14bn in assistance from the Australian government in 2017-18, made up of tax concessions ($7.3bn), budgetary assistance ($4.8bn) and tariffs ($2.3bn)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
