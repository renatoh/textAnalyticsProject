They have already suggested on numerous occasions this year that they are a team for all seasons and on a night where conditions were more reminiscent of the depths of winter as opposed to mid-spring, this was another emphatic box ticked by Smith\u2019s men. Their attacking prowess \u2013 masterminded here by the veteran Australian Kurt Gidley, who is oozing class on a regular basis during his inaugural few months in Super League \u2013 is what is gaining Warrington the headlines, with seven more tries here against an out-of-sorts Wigan side. But as well as the most potent attack in the competition, the Wolves also possess the leanest defence, a statistic Smith took particular pride in afterwards. \u201cI thought it probably took us about 15 minutes but then we started to turn the volume up,\u201d Smith said. \u201cOur defence kicked into gear and we got really physical. You know with Wigan it will be physical but I thought we built our game on our defence and got some reward by half-time.\u201d Warrington\u2019s last victory against Wigan four weeks ago was the night when the Wolves lost the half-back Chris Sandow, undoubtedly the competition\u2019s star player in the opening two months, to injury. That was believed to be the catalyst for a seismic shift in the Wolves\u2019 form, and although they have lost two of their past three since then, this was an emphatic return to form. Most Super League games of late had resembled a style of rugby more suited to touch and pass, with points aplenty and defensive efforts way below par \u2013 but driving rain before the match and the meeting of the competition\u2019s two meanest defences strongly hinted at a change in fortunes. For the opening half-hour, that was exactly how the game played out, with neither side giving the other an inch until Wigan broke the deadlock when Josh Charnley utilised the wet conditions to slide over from close range. However, that early setback stirred Warrington into life, and after Daryl Clark dived over for a well-executed try, Ben Westwood emerged from the bench to crash over with his first touch. Gidley converted both and, given the conditions, Warrington\u2019s 12-4 lead felt a commanding one. Yet the Wolves would still have time to strike a decisive blow right on half-time, when Kevin Penny claimed Stefan Ratchford\u2019s magnificent towering kick \u2013 with the finish from the winger equally as sublime. Two more Warrington tries inside the opening 20 minutes of the second half \u2013 both of them to the centre, Ryan Atkins \u2013 underlined Warrington\u2019s superiority and ultimately, their ability to handle the torrential conditions better. With the second-worst attack in Super League \u2013 only the defending champions Leeds have scored fewer points in 2016 \u2013 a comeback never looked likely for a Wigan side utterly devoid of creative influence. The return of the half-back George Williams after eight weeks out with a back problem did little to solve Wigan\u2019s offensive issues, but after Benjamin Jullien scored Warrington\u2019s sixth to compound the Warriors\u2019 misery, they were at least able to muster a consolation. As he has been most weeks this season, John Bateman was Wigan\u2019s standout player on the night, and although his endeavours were rewarded with a fine individual try late on, Warrington had the final say when Westwood scored his second. \u201cThey were too good for us,\u201d conceded the Wigan coach, Shaun Wane. \u201cI\u2019m happy with where we\u2019re at; they\u2019ve got a lot of players who are fit and healthy and I thought for 25 minutes we challenged them, but some of the tries we conceded were really poor.\u201d Warrington Russell; Penny, Evans, Atkins, Lineham; Gidley, Ratchford; Hill, Clark, Sims, Currie, Hughes, Westerman.
