The crown prosecution service said its lawyers had advised Ministry of Defence police there was insufficient evidence for a \"realistic prospect of conviction\" against Private Stuart Mackenzie. The editor of the Daily Mirror, Piers Morgan, was sacked after the photographs were published in the paper in May 2004. \"The potential offence considered was obtaining property by deception. We have concluded there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of a conviction,\" said the CPS in a statement. Earlier this year court martial proceedings against Private Mackenzie were suspended. The photographs, published in the Mirror on May 1 2004, appeared to show British troops torturing an Iraqi detainee. In one picture a soldier is seen urinating over a hooded man while in another the hooded man is being hit with a rifle. But doubts over the pictures' authenticity were expressed almost immediately, as the Royal Military Police launched an investigation. The Mirror admitted soon afterwards the photographs had been fake and apologised to its readers for publishing them. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
