The kit, manufactured by Warrior, met with approval from two members of that European Cup-winning side. \"I really like the shirt,\" Alan Kennedy said. \"The stripe and collar details resemble the shirt we wore during the cup final in 1984. The new shirt is very light and I'm told the material will keep players cool, something we desperately needed back when we were playing in the sweltering heat in Rome.\" Ian Rush believes it will be \"one for the fans\" but also popular with the players. \"It'll remind them of the club's history of success and drive them even more to bring that success back to the club,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
