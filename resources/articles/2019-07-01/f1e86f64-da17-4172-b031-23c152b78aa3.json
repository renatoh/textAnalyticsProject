I cannot believe that is happening to our country.\u201d Campbell, who rose to prominence as former UK prime minister Tony Blair\u2019s chief spin doctor, and is commonly thought of as the basis of Malcolm Tucker in The Thick Of It (although this is contested by Peter Capaldi) \u2013 has remained as outspoken on UK politics as you would expect of someone with his all-seeing reputation. He has watched as Brexit has torn apart not just the conservative government but the country at large, and his own side of politics. But on that, he doesn\u2019t just blame the Tories. \u201cI think democratic politics is going through a very, very challenging period,\u201d he says of the western world at large. \u201cI think there are all sort of factors. \u201cI think if I look at one big factor, for me, [it] is the crash, it is a consequence of the global financial crisis playing out, and the feeling that lots and lots of people around the world had nothing to do with it, didn\u2019t cause it and they paid a price, and the people that did cause it didn\u2019t pay much of a price at all. \u201cSo that is one factor. The other factor, and I guess Trump is the sort of apotheosis [of this], and Brexit is part of this as well, is the sense of polarisation that isn\u2019t just about left and right, it is also about cultural attitudes. \u201cAnd I think the media changes, not just social media, but the mainstream media has been part of this as well, with the 24/7 news and the way that has changed the nature of news. I think newspapers \u2013 not least the influence of Murdoch and others \u2013 I think that absolute politicisation, and polarisation of the news media debate, has been exploited and exasperated by populism.\u201d Campbell won\u2019t just be in Australia to escape the expected coming of Boris Johnson. He was invited to speak at events hosted by Orygen and the University of New South Wales Centre for Ideas on the politics of mental health. That\u2019s another topic Campbell is intimately across. In 1986, he had a breakdown, which in 2008 he openly spoke about both in a BBC2 documentary, Depression and Me, and a book, All in the Mind. He thinks more people should speak up about their own struggles, if only to help rid mental illness of the stigmas that still allow it to go unspoken or be cut from budgets. Even those in the political classes. \u201cI think you could argue that politics at the top level is something of a laboratory for mental health pressures \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean, by the way, that that is necessarily all bad,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the arguments I\u2019ll make when I come to Australia and I do these speeches about mental health is when you are talking about top-level pressure and top-level performance, whether that is in politics, in sport, in theatre, in business or whatever, then that sense of \u2018living on the edge\u2019 feeling of knowing how to handle really intense pressure \u2013 sometimes the people who have had experience of real psychological turmoil sometimes can cope with that better.\u201d History has been defined by agenda setters who did great things, Campbell says, while simultaneously battling their own minds. Winston Churchill and his Black Dog. Charles Darwin and his agoraphobia. Florence Nightingale and her depression. Friends and family who keep going, despite life-long illnesses, such as Campbell\u2019s own schizophrenic brother. \u201cWhat I think this mental health debate needs is a government in one part of the world that actually doesn\u2019t just say \u2018this is a priority\u2019 but then really delivers on it, right across the sphere, so we have better mental health support in schools, we have better mental health support in [universities], we have better mental health services for children and adolescents, we have better acute care right across the piece,\u201d he says, citing the Irish government\u2019s decision to ban smoking in workplaces as sparking a worldwide wave of change. \u201cI think if you did that, over time, over a generation, you\u2019d actually see that the healthcare system as a whole, I think, would end up saving money. \u201cIf we actually start to educate our kids about their mental health and wellbeing, including in schools, and also have a review of the criminal justice system \u2013 and this probably seems too Guardianista for a lot of people \u2013 but anybody who\u2019s ever been inside a prison knows you do not have to go far before you meet somebody and you go \u2018that person is ill, that person is sick, that person needs help\u2019.\u201d Yet a failure to holistically deal with mental health issues has not been the only failure of governments. Campbell says he has watched as a form of \u201cpopulist virus\u201d has spread across democracies in the past decade, which traditional politics has so far struggled to address. But progressives haven\u2019t helped themselves in this shift, Campbell says. \u201cThe other thing which has happened, and I feel this particularly in the UK, where, you know, we have gone from New Labour being, I don\u2019t care what anyone says, a very successful government, three election wins with pretty big majorities, delivering lots of change, but unless progressives stand up for the record of progressives don\u2019t be surprised if people think that actually there are easier way of doing things out there, and they then go for the populist message. \u201cAnd I think what we have at the moment is a populist virus.\u201d Which brings Campbell back to Johnson, who, at time of publication, is widely tipped to win the leadership ballot Theresa May\u2019s resignation announcement sparked in May. The recent televised debate between the party\u2019s leading figures, Jeremy Hunt and Johnson, crystallised how populism had changed politics. \u201cI mean, we have gone from figures like Thatcher leading the Tory party to this being the choice,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cBut also, it was the extent to which the really simplistic, populist, fact-free rhetoric was the stuff which was getting the applause. Where even five, 10 years ago, there would have been the absolute howl of \u2018How are you going to pay for it? What happens if that doesn\u2019t happen?\u2019 \u201cSo the guy stands up and says \u2018we\u2019re leaving the European Union on October 31 come what may\u2019 \u2013 well, how? With what consequences? \u201cWhat populism does \u2013 populism is not just about popularity and saying what people want to hear, it is also about having a date that if you like has nothing to do with fact or proper rigorous analysis and everything to do with emotion. \u201cAnd ultimately, that is unsustainable.\u201d But Campbell is unsure of whether the answer is a Bernie Sanders, or a Jeremy Corbyn, or even an Anthony Albanese \u2013 at least as he is described by his conservative opponents, who are trying to paint him as the Australian Corbyn. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you combat the populism of the right with a populism of the left,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I fear is too many people on what you would say is the progressive side of politics, I think, have learned the wrong lessons about the [global financial] crash. I think there is a feeling that, as a consequence of the crash, the world, the public, moved to the left. And I am not persuaded that is the case. And if you look at what is happening in elections around the world, the opposite would appear to be the case.\u201d Launching that cultural war \u201crisks losing those people you need to win [elections]\u201d, Campbell says. \u201cAt the last election, Theresa May fought the worst campaign ever,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was truly awful. You look at where we are now \u2013 Brexit is tearing the country apart, the government is doing nothing else, the Tories are about to elect a complete charlatan as prime minister, and Labour \u2013 there was one poll recently which had Labour at 18%. \u201cNow that is not a media conspiracy, and it is not just because of Brexit. It is because they think progressive means keep moving to the left. It doesn\u2019t. Progressive means \u2018How do you make progressive change for the better by having a set of policies and values which are located where most people live their lives?\u201d Applying that same train of thought to the recent Australian election, Campbell says, from where he sits, he thinks yet another factor may have come into play \u2013 one which could also dictate the coming UK general election. \u201cI wondered about your election, because I follow it from afar, but I just wonder if maybe what happens \u2013 at a deeper level sometimes \u2013 a country sometimes makes a judgment about people over time, and I just wonder if they just decided \u2018we are not electing Bill Shorten\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think there is a risk they have done that with Jeremy Corbyn already.\u201d \u2022 Alastair Campbell will be speaking at The Politics of Mental Health in Sydney on Monday 22 July and in Melbourne on Tuesday 23 July.
