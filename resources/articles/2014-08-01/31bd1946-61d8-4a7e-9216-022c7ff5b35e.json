Andy Coulson still has friends", "bodyText": "\u2022 A feature of the fall of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson has been the stance of his former employer. One minute he was a darling, the next he was having to take the Murdoch empire to court for payment of his legal costs. And for the eagle-eyed, there were indications on the weekend of some soul-searching. The former MP Louise Mensch is pretty well-connected within the empire. Now resident in New York, she usually files from there. But this week, she has been able to give readers a rundown of what has been happening with Coulson within the British judicial system. \u201cCoulson is still banged up in Belmarsh, a tough category A prison, while [Rolf] Harris has been shifted to a far easier, non-secure facility,\u201d wrote Mensch. \u201cWhy the hell is he still in Belmarsh when ex-cabinet member Chris Huhne, who admitted perverting the course of justice, was moved right away to an ordinary prison? So was his wife, Vicky Pryce.\u201d It\u2019s a cry from the heart. \u201cAndy Coulson hasn\u2019t been categorised \u2013 and sources say he is spending up to 20 hours a day in his cell. Murderers, child molesters and corrupt politicians are all treated better. So tell us, what is the operational reason for that?\u201d You gotta have friends, as they say. \u2022 The wilfully contentious play The Confessions of Gordon Brown continues to provoke comment for audiences at the Edinburgh fringe. Amended, it offers commentary on the failure of the western powers to reverse the implosion in Iraq and Syria. In the newly inserted line, Gordon (aka actor Ian Grieve) illustrates the frustrations of London and Washington. \u201cToday I will order more air strikes in Iraq to deter the rebels and stave off the fall of Baghdad \u2013 for another month at least.\u201d Faces change in Downing Street but the impotence is much the same. \u2022 How far has project Boris progressed in its aim to install Johnson as Tory leader? The answer, one must conclude, is that all of the elements are being put in place. According to Andrew Gimson, one of Boris\u2019s biographers, he is already acting as if he has jobs in his gift. Gimson wrote in the Mail on Sunday of a meeting with a Tory \u2013 dubbed the would-be \u201cminister for paperclips\u201d \u2013 who saw hopes for preferment dashed in the last reshuffle. Aggrieved, the Tory apparently called Boris. \u201cAnd what a sympathetic hearing he received from the mayor of London,\u201d reports Gimson. \u201cI am happy to report that Paperclip has gone off on holiday with a spring in his step. For he is under the impression that Boris has every intention of offering him a job commensurate with his talents, as soon as the present ministerial team can be got rid of. The talking is now over. Cripes, what a lovely war. \u2022 Promises will be made and friendships forged as the mayor displays his networking abilities. And, judging by the extensive list of those who have recently provided the blond bombshell with a gift recently, the mayor is a man who is not short of admirers from all backgrounds. Quite why someone thinks he needs a Herm\u00e8s scarf and a \u00a3465 ashtray is open to conjecture. Still, it was nice of Joanna Lumley to send flowers. \u2022 Finally, the world seems to spin faster as Huddersfield Town sack their manager Mark Robins, following a 4-0 loss at home in their first match of the new season. This is eye-wateringly early, even by the standards of a profession in which only 12 out of the 92 English football league managers have been in their jobs for three years or more. But it could herald an exciting season ahead for the managerial sack race. It is dangerous to say that such a thing has never happened so early in a season, for life seems to throw its curveballs earlier and earlier. But being sacked on August 10 in a new football season is as astonishing in its way as Derek Foster resigning from the Blair government after just two days as a minister in 1997. It is probably the first time that a football manager has been sacked before the start of the grouse shooting season on Tuesday. Notable, if not the sort of achievement one flags up on the CV. diary@theguardian.com twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
