The privatised postal operator will take on 15,000 in England, 1,100 in Scotland, 600 in Wales and 400 in Northern Ireland for temporary sorting roles between mid November and early January 2015. A further 2,000 people will be hired to help out with parcels at Royal Mail\u2019s Parcelforce Worldwide division. The peak of recruitment will be in December. The extra workers will support Royal Mail\u2019s army of 124,000 staff cope with the huge volume of Christmas cards and presents. Last year the company delivered more than 10 million parcels a day in the run up to Christmas. Sue Whalley, Royal Mail\u2019s chief operations officer, said: \u201cChristmas is the busiest time of the year for Royal Mail and we plan all year round to help ensure we deliver the best possible service to our customers. Every Christmas, we make a substantial financial commitment in additional resources to handle the festive mailbag, including the recruitment of thousands of temporary workers.\u201d The number of temporary workers to be hired this year is down on last year, when it advertised for 21,000 temporary positions. Royal Mail has set up a dedicated website for applications at www.royalmailgroup.com/xmasjobs. Yodel, an independent parcel delivery firm, is also anticipating surging demand in the run-up to Christmas. It will create 5,000 seasonal jobs across the UK, including 2,830 self-employed neighbourhood couriers. Other companies are expected to announce big festive recruitment drives in coming weeks. In previous years Sainsbury\u2019s has hired 15,000 extra workers, and Marks &amp; Spencer has taken on 20,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
