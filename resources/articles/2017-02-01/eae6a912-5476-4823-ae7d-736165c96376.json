In the return of Last Week Tonight to HBO, the British comic used the episode to investigate the problem that Trump appears to have with the truth. \u201cSince taking office around 412 years ago, Trump has made it clear that reality is not important to him,\u201d he said. He showed footage of Trump claiming that his inauguration was rain-free, thanks to God\u2019s intervention, and compared it to actual video from the day. \u201cWe have a president capable of standing in the rain and saying it was a sunny day,\u201d he said. Oliver went on to explain that this worryingly comfortable relationship with deception could wreak havoc on the country. \u201cTrump\u2019s relationship with the truth is going to be of profound importance going forward because any policy discussion has to begin with a shared sense of reality and Trump\u2019s reality can change within a single sentence,\u201d he said. He called him a \u201cpathological liar\u201d with \u201ca well-documented 40-year history of bullshit\u201d. He also looked back on commentators, including Peter Thiel, who talked about his more extreme promises during the election and claimed that these weren\u2019t actual policies. \u201cIt was worth taking him seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump was telling the truth about the solutions to the problems he was lying about and he is now making real policy based on fake facts.\u201d Oliver examined the source of Trump\u2019s information and compared his choice of language in tweets with similar terminology used on Fox News. \u201cYou would hope that as president, he would now be getting information from primary sources and briefings but Trump still watches a phenomenal amount of cable news,\u201d he said. \u201cHis tweets frequently echo things that just aired on TV.\u201d He played footage from the president on Air Force One as commercials played loudly in the background. \u201cTrump just made the interior of Air Force One sound like the living room of an old person who died three days ago and who nobody\u2019s found yet,\u201d he said. But his favorite news organization appears to be the far-right site Breitbart, which Oliver said contained \u201cthe kind of headlines you see your old high school friend share on Facebook and think, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a shame, I guess Greg sucks now\u2019\u201d. He also discussed Alex Jones, the controversial head of Infowars who believes that water turns people gay and that Sandy Hook was staged. \u201cIf the government had actually hired actors, there is no way that their stage parents would have stopped talking about it,\u201d he said. Oliver went on: \u201cThere is a pattern here: Trump sees something that jibes with his worldview, doesn\u2019t check it, half-remembers it and then passes it on, at which point it takes on a life of its own and appears to validate itself.\u201d He explained the troubling effect of this: \u201cIf you get your news from similar sources to him, as many, many, many people do, he doesn\u2019t look like a crank, he looks like the first president to ever tell you the real truth.\u201d When confronted by the president\u2019s many falsehoods, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, frequently explains that Trump believes it to be true and that\u2019s what matters. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about belief,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be. Incidence of voter fraud is a verifiable fact and faith and facts aren\u2019t like Bill Pullman and Bill Paxton. When you confuse them, it actually matters. Real people get hurt when you make policy based on false information. Billions will get spent on a wall that won\u2019t work to prevent a crimewave that isn\u2019t happening while refugees sit in dangerous situations to prevent Bowling Green-style massacres that never took place.\u201d Oliver then came up with a solution. If Trump gets his information from cable news then that\u2019s how to reach him. Oliver then detailed a plan to air commercials that actually educate the president on important issues, such as explaining the nuclear triad, how to use appetizer forks and what his other daughter is called."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
