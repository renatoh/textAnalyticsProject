Labour is finally getting into its stride as a moderately social democratic government using economic strength to deliver improved public services and more social justice. This government is far from perfect, but the run-up to Thursday's elections is a good moment to register its successes. More people are in work than ever before. Britain is enjoying the longest period of economic expansion since records began in the 19th century. And, for the first time in decades, it is not just the affluent and the private realm who are enjoying all the fruits of prosperity. Taxes and benefits are being used to quietly but substantially redistribute income from the richest to the poorest in society. Important progress is being made in reducing child and pensioner poverty. The large sums which have flowed into the health service are producing tangible results. Even the railways, for so long a wretched reproach to government, show signs of improvement. So why the universal expectation - not least within the government itself - that they will do badly in this Thursday's elections? On top of the usual mid-term blues, there's the problem that little seems to be at stake in elections for the European Parliament and local government. Fringe parties such as the UK Independence Party and the BNP get their best chance to prosper when zealots turn out to vote while moderate people sit on their hands. All the main parties have disappointed over the European dimension of these elections: none has made positive arguments for the European Union. Even the most pro-European Liberal Democrats have opportunistically tried to turn this ballot into a referendum on Iraq. As Tony Blair himself recently acknowledged, Iraq currently clouds everything else achieved by his government. For some traditional supporters of Labour, their opposition to the removal of Saddam eclipses any other consideration. The problem for those wishing to register a protest against the war is choosing how to do so. The Liberal Democrats opposed the war only until it began. Respect, the George Galloway party, is an unholy alliance of the far-left and reactionary Islamist fundamentalists. The best place to register an anti-war vote is with the Greens. In the London mayoral contest, all three representatives of the main parties say they were opposed to the invasion of Iraq. So it is for his record at City Hall, rather than his irrelevant views on foreign policy, that this newspaper would give a second term to Ken Livingstone. While not without his flaws, he has been far from the disaster once predicted by the Prime Minister. Mayor Livingstone has made the job count. His mistakes are outweighed by his achievements. His opponents have not made a compelling case that they would be superior in the job. He deserves particular credit for having the courage to introduce the pioneering Congestion Charge which has reduced traffic and pollution in the centre of the city. For this reason and others, he is almost certain to be re-elected, and with the votes of quite a lot of people who would not describe themselves as naturally Labour. There will be many other parts of the country where party allegiance is less important to voters than is rewarding or punishing local leaders for the quality of service they deliver. Whether your eye is on the local picture or the big one, the worst mistake anyone can make anywhere is to think that these elections don't matter. It is true that they won't decide who governs at Westminster. This is a temptation to Labour supporters, who would normally come out to defend their government from the Tories, to stay at home or flirt with protest parties. They should be mindful that these elections will shape the climate of the run-up to the next general election. Those who want Labour to carry on delivering on social justice and investment in public services should be wary of the consequences of boosting the Conservatives and those further off to the right. Wherever you put your vote, place it somewhere. Every abstention makes it easier for parties of the nasty and illiberal fringe to claim to be more representative of Britain than they really are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
