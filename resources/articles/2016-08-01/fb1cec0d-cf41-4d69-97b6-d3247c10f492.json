For screenwriters like me, it's a relief to have proof", "bodyText": "\u201cEvery time an ethnic person comes on screen, 50,000 people change the channel.\u201d I was relatively new to the world of television when I heard an executive say that in a meeting. I was both stunned and acutely aware that I held the least amount of power in the room. Later a colleague explained to me the concept of minute-by-minute ratings, which pinpoint the exact moment viewers change the channel or turn off their TV. Presumably the networks or their advisors had examined the dips and spikes in the ratings and concluded that when people of colour turn up, Australia tunes out. This conclusion is patronising and outdated at best and completely false at worst (we didn\u2019t experience a mass exodus from movie theatres when a black stormtrooper was introduced in Star Wars), and yet since the dawn of Australian television 60 years ago, what effectively amounts to a White Australia Policy has been governing who appears on our screens and the manner in which they are depicted. The fault of the problem is broader than simply commissioning networks and their executives. I\u2019ve experienced an entire culture of resistance when it comes to diversity on-screen. I remember a production meeting on a different show later in my career, when I pointed out to the crew present that casting the only Asian actor in an entire series to play a criminal would be problematic. My solution was to cast another Asian actor in a positive role \u2013 at that stage a few police officers were up for grabs. Unfortunately, nobody else shared my view \u2013 or if they did, they chose not to vocalise it. You could argue that the resistance was less to diversity than it was to a mouthy young writer who hadn\u2019t earned the right to offer opinions on casting; television can be very territorial like that. Either way, there was a palpable reaction to the challenging of the status quo, and another Asian actor got to add \u201ccriminal\u201d to their IMDB page. (And no, I didn\u2019t succeed in getting another Asian character in the mix.) In television as in most industries, the higher you are in the ranks, the more weight is given to your opinion. If you\u2019re just starting out and push for a more inclusive industry, the people above you will tend to just hear you calling them prejudiced. And in my experience, their first response will be to deny that a problem exists: Australian television does accurately reflect our society, and if you think otherwise, that\u2019s your problem. Thanks to research released this week by Screen Australia, which I consulted on, this fingers-in-the-ears argument has been officially decommissioned. Seeing Ourselves: Reflections on Diversity in TV Drama is the first analysis in 14 years into diversity on Australian scripted television. The results confirm that a gulf exists between the diversity we see in our day to day lives, and what is depicted on-screen. Our television is not progressing at the same rate as Australia is diversifying, with non-European minorities \u2013 including from Indian, Asian and Middle Eastern backgrounds \u2013 accounting for only 6% of on-screen characters, despite making up 17% of the Australian population. The biggest disparity from population to screen befell people with a disability. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 18% of Australians reported having a disability in 2012, but only 4% of the main characters in Australian TV dramas broadcast between 2011 and 2015 were identifiably characters with a disability. The report shows that we are also still lacking when it comes to LGBTQI representation. It\u2019s not all bad news: Indigenous Australians make up 3% of the population and are represented at 5% on screen, a success which the head of the Indigenous department at Screen Australia, Penny Smallacombe, said came down to having more Indigenous decision-makers behind the scenes, and government and funding initiatives supporting them. This brings us to an interesting point. While the Screen Australia study did not attempt to capture the diversity of people behind the scenes in the television industry, according to 2011 census data 73% of people in the screen industries are from Anglo-Celtic backgrounds compared with 67% among other industries. The Screen Australia report says \u201ca diversity of backgrounds among decision-makers as well as producers, directors and writers\u201d will facilitate diversity in content. The benefits go beyond simply social inclusion; there is growing research to support the idea of the \u201cdiversity dividend\u201d. According to McKinsey research from 2015, companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35% more likely to outperform their respective national industry medians. Earlier this year, the UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report found that TV shows with culturally diverse casts rate better than shows without. We\u2019ve all intuitively felt that our screens were underperforming on diversity. Still, as someone who has fought for diversity from the inside \u2013 sometimes unsuccessfully \u2013 I can\u2019t overstate how important it is to have official data from our federal screen funding agency to help me make my case. Every time a practitioner is made to feel troublesome or obsessive when they push for inclusion, here is the report that says: \u201cYou\u2019re not imagining this problem.\u201d In terms of cultural diversity, a lot has changed in the last five years. With a commitment to cultural diversity outlined in its charter, SBS leads the way with programs designed to have majority diverse-background casts, such as The Principal and The Family Law. The ABC\u2019s Black Comedy and Redfern Now exemplify how diversity doesn\u2019t compromise the quality of comedy or drama. Lebanese-Australian actor Firass Dirani is a Channel Nine star, debuting on the small screen in Underbelly: The Golden Mile and landing a recurring lead role in House Husbands. Nine also cast Indigenous actor Miranda Tapsell in the high-rating drama Love Child \u2013 which won Tapsell two Logie awards \u2013 and brought a Lebanese family to prime-time with Here Come the Habibs. Channel 7 have cast Indigenous singer and actor Jessica Mauboy as the lead in their upcoming drama The Secret Daughter, while Channel Ten have cast Indigenous actor Rob Collins in their upcoming adaptation of Zoe Foster Blake\u2019s The Wrong Girl. Foxtel have a strong track record for diversity in drama, with Wentworth featuring several characters from diverse cultural backgrounds and sexual orientations and, more recently, Secret City\u2019s transgender lead. But as the statistics show, we\u2019re not there yet. We need strategic intervention, industry-wide cooperation and targeted initiatives \u2013 and we don\u2019t have to look very far for inspiration. Screen Australia\u2019s suite of Gender Matters funding included Brilliant Stories \u2013 funding specifically for projects where women held at least three roles across director, writer, producer and lead character. There\u2019s a few things that could happen next. The ABC, our tax-funded broadcaster, could set a diversity target: increasing the current 18% of characters from non-Anglo-Celtic backgrounds to match the population of 32% by 2020, for instance. We have seen the massive gains made in Indigenous screen content thanks to targeted state and federal funding and commitment from training institutions, production companies and broadcasters. Our guilds and production companies could apply for funding to create behind-the-scenes placements for people from diverse backgrounds. Or here\u2019s one that wouldn\u2019t cost a cent: imagine if Screen Australia didn\u2019t fund any project where the keys creatives hadn\u2019t undertaken subconscious bias training. Project Implicit have made their tests freely available online. If funding were contingent on this, there would be no question \u2013 everyone would do it. Graeme Mason, CEO of Screen Australia, says it is a complex issue, but one that highlights cultural, creative and commercial opportunities. \u201cWe\u2019re open to anything that will encourage people the best we can,\u201d he says. \u201cThere might be one approach for the SBS and the ABC [and a different one for] a commercial broadcaster,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in any sector should be scared of this. We\u2019re not dictating. We\u2019re saying, what are the options and the opportunities?\u201d Let\u2019s not forget the power of voting with your eyeballs and your social media accounts. If you love Miranda Tapsell in Love Child and Tyler De Nawi in Here Come the Habibs, leave a note on the network\u2019s Facebook page, or write to the production company. If you want to go a step further, join, donate or volunteer with companies who work with diverse communities, like Information and Cultural Exchange (ICE) and Curiousworks. And if you work in the industry and someone pitches a more inclusive suggestion, don\u2019t be afraid to back them up. There is goodwill in the television industry, we just need to harness it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
