With the ink barely dry on his contract to represent the Kungsangen club, where this event is being played near Stockholm, the amiable Ulsterman, a professional only seven weeks, arrived too late for a full practice round over a course he had never seen. But the young man who helped Britain and Ireland to a historic Walker Cup win in the United States last August still shot into the lead with seven birdies. McDowell, 23 this week, can thank his Ryder Cup compatriot Darren Clarke for his Swedish rhapsody. \"He's given me lots of help and advice and introduced me to his management company, which fixed me up with the [Kungsangen club] deal,\" he explained. \"I aimed to be out in time for a practice round but my flight from Belfast was delayed and I managed only nine holes, walking the other nine. \"My caddie recommended playing the trickier front nine, which was my second nine today, and I covered it in 31 with four birdies in the last five holes. It's a dream come true.\" In fact McDowell's career to date has been something of a dream come true. This season, in his final year at Alabama university, he was ranked top collegiate golfer in the United States with six wins in 12 outings and a stroke average of 69.28 compared with Tiger Woods' 70.20 in the year he was America's top student golfer. Last month he was runner-up in a Challenge Tour event in Hamburg and with his confidence soaring he looks a superstar in the making. \"I've got seven [European] tour invites and my target is to win my card. A good week here would be a bonus,\" he said. \"I figured if I could finish in the top 12 or 15 in the college rankings in the States I must be good enough to turn pro but I've probably over-prepared and I felt tired and sluggish today. My chipping and putting has been letting me down but I'm making fewer and fewer mistakes.\" Another former amateur star, the Australian Adam Scott, would have matched McDowell's seven-under 64 but for a four at the short 12th. His five birdies and an eagle put him five clear of his playing partner Colin Montgomerie, the defending champion, who finished birdie, birdie for a 70 and pronounced himself \"delighted\". \u00b7 England's Samantha Head shot a course-record 66 to lead the first round of the inaugural Norwegian Masters in Oslo but her compatriot Laura Davies dropped four shots in the last three holes for a one-over 73."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
