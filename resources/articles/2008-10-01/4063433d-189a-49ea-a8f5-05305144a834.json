His collaborators range from the sculptor Antony Gormley, who provides the cover art, to a cast that includes Paul McCartney, Anoushka Shankar and Spanish stars Ojos de Brujo, providing musical influences that range from flamenco to drum'n'bass, Indian classical styles, dub and pop balladry. Remarkably, it works. It starts with the vivid and descriptive Days of Fire, which already sounds like an urban classic and was co-written by London singer Natty, who witnessed the 7/7 bus bombing and was in Stockwell tube station at the time of the De Menezes killing. McCartney co-wrote the thoughtful My Soul, which is given an Asian edge thanks to the flute and backing vocals from Reena Bhardwaj, while Aruba Red worked with Sawhney on the edgy Last Train to Midnight. A gentle, powerful and personal lament for London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
