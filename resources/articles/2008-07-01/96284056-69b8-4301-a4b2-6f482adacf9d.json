Queiroz has often been described as a father figure to Ronaldo and Sir Alex Ferguson was hoping his No2 would play a significant role in persuading the double player-of-the-year to resist Real Madrid's advances. However, the president of the Portugal Football Federation, Gilberto Madail, is understood to have flown into Manchester yesterday and to be determined to conclude a deal. Madail has put together a deal worth an annual \u00a31.1m but is likely to encounter stiff resistance at a time when Ferguson is not just indebted to Queiroz's work on the training ground but is also intent on doing everything possible to dissuade Ronaldo from trying to force a transfer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
