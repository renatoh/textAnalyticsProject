Paul Pogba, on as a second-half substitute for United, won the penalty that Bruno Fernandes converted, getting in front of Eric Dier with a piece of skill and then going to ground. United almost had another spot-kick when Fernandes went down under another Dier challenge only for VAR replays to show that the Portuguese had dived and make the overrule. Mourinho said he did not want to talk about United\u2019s goal before proceeding to talk about it. \u201cOn the first penalty, the referee, Jonathan [Moss] \u2013 he made his decision and I agree it\u2019s difficult for referees but then the VAR is a different story. Referees can make mistakes but I don\u2019t think VAR should make mistakes [in terms of not overruling]. \u201cThe second penalty is incredible. It\u2019s a foul on Serge Aurier which should kill the situation and then there is a situation in the box [with Fernandes diving]. I feel when the VAR goes for a simulation, the player should be exposed and [given] a yellow card. So I feel really upset with these two decisions but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d United got on top after Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r introduced Pogba and Mason Greenwood in the 62nd minute. They would later bring on Nemanja Matic, Eric Bailly and Odion Ighalo. With Dele Alli suspended and Lucas Moura injured, Mourinho highlighted his lack of game-changing options off the bench. \u201cThe five changes was a request by the powerful squads,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt was made by top teams with top options and benches, and it was followed by the teams with the same situations.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r praised Pogba\u2019s contribution from the bench and defended his goalkeeper David de Gea, saying Steven Bergwijn\u2019s fierce shot that resulted in the opener deceived him in the air. The Spaniard failed to keep the Dutchman\u2019s effort out, which opened the scoring for the home side. De Gea was well positioned behind the ball but proved unable to prevent the goal. However the United manager said: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that they scored with their first chance. David is disappointed but the ball was moving through the air. We reacted well after that and David made a good save five minutes after that [from Son Heung-min]. We had a bad spell for 10 minutes so when David saved that we were still in the game at half-time.\u201d When Solskj\u00e6r brought Pogba on the French midfielder rewarded him with a game-changing cameo that led to his side\u2019s equalising penalty. \u201cPaul did well and it\u2019s not a problem having a fit Paul in the squad,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHe did everything a midfielder should do, he tackled, he won the ball, he played passes and showed skill. Everyone saw the quality he can provide. \u201cHe always has a point to prove to himself and to us \u2013 he wants to be the best. He\u2019s had such a frustrating season with all his injuries [but] he has shown how he can contribute. He showed skills to win us the penalty. I just look forward to getting him fitter. Gradually, we will see more and more of him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
