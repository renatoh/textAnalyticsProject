It\u2019s not often England face Argentina in a match as heavy favourites, but in Le Havre Phil Neville\u2019s side are being backed to give the Albicelestes the kind of drubbing the not so brave boys of 86 and 98 could only dream of. The reason for this uber-optimism is that it\u2019s a miracle Argentina have made it to France 2019 at all. With the country\u2019s FA seemingly being run by suits with views on women that could be plucked from a Bernard Manning highlights reel, Argentina did not play at all between 2015 and 2017 as players downed tools over the AFA\u2019s refusal to pay them \u00a36.70 a day. \u00a36.70 a day! And to think we thought we were being stiffed by The Man. Fifa listed the team as unranked until they started playing again just two years ago. And only in April did the AFA agree to help eight squad members go professional by paying them a whopping \u00a3260 a month. Gee, thanks gentlemen! So it\u2019s little surprise Argentina\u2019s players celebrated the 0-0 draw with Japan like they\u2019d just won the World Cup. Especially given the way Scotland have been swept aside too. In two years the team have gone from hardly existing at all to holding their own against the 2015 runners-up. Perhaps bookies didn\u2019t bother watching the match, because had they done so they would have seen Carlos Borrello giving a masterclass in how to park a bus against better funded opponents. A bus which England, who haven\u2019t scored for fun of late, might struggle to get around. \u201cWe\u2019re going against a team that will sit back and defend and we\u2019ll have limited opportunities,\u201d parped Phil Neville, who is likely to call on midfield locksmith Jade Moore to try and find a way through the blue and white wall. He then moved swiftly on to some sweeping generalisations. \u201cI\u2019ve told the players this is a proud nation, a big powerful football nation. You are playing against history. When you talk about street football you\u2019re talking about South American players who have grown up with nothing.\u201d Neville\u2019s opposite number Borello, meanwhile, reckons his team is more than just a one-trick bus. \u201cWe have come to try. England is a great team, we know this,\u201d he tooted, having perhaps only watched the first half of the 2-1 win against Scotland. \u201cBut we also have things up our sleeve, we have passion, and we are going to give it our all. We have passion!\u201d he roared again, just to make sure we got it. They also have the benefit of zero expectations. The pressure is all on England. So good luck with that.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cThe interesting Google results of various \u2018D1cks\u2019 searches (Fiver letters passim) reminded me of a time I was on a work call and someone mentioned a piece of software called \u2018GlassFish\u2019. Not having heard of this before, I quickly opened my browser and Googled it. I apparently did this too quickly for my computer at the time, which missed the first two characters of my search. Let\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t get too many software-related results\u201d \u2013 David Koppe. \u201cHere in the good old USA! USA!! USA!!! my spirits are kept barely above despair by two things: first, the UK\u2019s political mess, which manages to assuage my fears that we will be in political hell alone; and secondly, reading The Fiver (even when I don\u2019t know who you are talking about)\u201d \u2013 Patricia Hirsch. \u201cAre we allowed to just plug our upcoming football tournaments now? In that case, can I mention the Refugee World Cup on Saturday 22 June in Albert Park, Salford? It\u2019s in its 20th year now, raising funds for Manchester\u2019s refugee and asylum seeker population. You don\u2019t have to print this letter, of course, but then I would have to assume it\u2019s because The Fiver has \u2018an agenda\u2019\u201d \u2013 Alex Palmer.

But, back from Monday: prizes. BITS AND BOBS Frank Lampard is set to be rewarded for winning nothing as a football manager by being given the Chelsea job, with Maurizio Sarri taking his Sarriball off to Juventus. Real Madrid legend Jonathan Woodgate has been appointed Middlesbrough manager, with boyhood Boro fan Robbie Keane named among his assistants. \u201cWe want as many fans back in the stadium as we can by playing attacking, exciting football,\u201d he cheered. South Yorkshire police is to change its approach after an internal review following its operation at the Sheffield derby in March, which was heavily criticised by supporters as heavy-handed, violent and dangerous. West Ham have signed Pablo Fornals for \u00a324m from Villarreal. \u201cManuel [Pellegrini] was a big influence because he is one of the best coaches in the world, and who doesn\u2019t want to work with people like that?\u201d boot-licked the playmaker. Genk have told Brighton beancounters to find some more beans after rejecting an \u00a318m bid for Belgium winger Leandro Trossard. The EFL Trophy will feature Manchester United\u2019s and Liverpool\u2019s U-21 sides next season. And Diego Maradona has seen himself through the Dorados door marked Do One after just a year as manager to focus on getting his shoulder-gah and back-knack fixed. \u201cTogether we surprised the world. We showed that football is passion and heart,\u201d roared the club. STILL WANT MORE?

Mauricio Pochettino is desperate to refresh his Spurs squad amid falling points totals and he\u2019s optimistically handed Daniel Levy a shopping list, writes David Hytner. \u201cWe\u2019re small but mighty!\u201d Nope, not The Fiver\u2019s opinion of itself, it\u2019s Bermuda\u2019s trumpeting of their plans to emulate Iceland\u2019s World Cup run.
