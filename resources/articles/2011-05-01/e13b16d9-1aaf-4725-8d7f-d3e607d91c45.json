As Book pointed out, it is left feet that are usually described as \"educated\" and, in Silva's case, there is a strong argument his could have a degree when it comes to the art of finding the killer pass. Or running with the ball, jinking, leaning, edging ever close to the defender, before swaying free at the last possible moment. It is that vision and balance that makes Silva a player of uncommon ability. Then there is the close control, the origins of which can be traced back to his childhood in Arguinegu\u00edn, the fishing village in southern Gran Canaria, where the four-year-old Silva would play with a ball his father, Fernando, had made out of cloths and rags. The family had grown tired of the way the young Silva would procure oranges from the fruit bowl or potatoes from the bottom of the fridge. \"We would play with anything we could find,\" Silva says of those street games with his cousins and friends. These days, you would trust him to do keepie-ups with an egg. His family have moved with him to Manchester \u2013 one of the primary reasons, he says, why he has acclimatised so quickly to his new surroundings. There is one downside and, by his own admission, his English lessons have ground to a halt. \"Hello,\" is the sum total of this interview without the use of an interpreter, though he promises that he will improve for next time. Yet Silva has embraced life in his new city. There were stories earlier this season that he was homesick and it is true, for a boy from the Canary Islands, there have been mornings when the pounding rain makes him blow out his cheeks in despair. But Silva was indignant when those stories surfaced. \"It's been a really good first year,\" he says. \"I settled in really quickly and that has been the key. That's down to everyone at the club but the thing that has surprised me, amazed me actually, is that you can just have a normal life away from football here. In Spain it's really tough to go anywhere because people are in your face. Here it's marvellous. You can just go out and be unnoticed. Or when people come up to say hello they are so nice and respectful. I like that nice, quiet life.\" He did have reservations about joining City at first. \"Spain is such a competitive league and, for the players to give up La Liga, it's such a tough decision.\" Plus City at the time were not in the Champions League. \"But I always wanted to play in the Premier League. City came in strongly for me, put their cards on the table and what I have found out since is that every game in England is a privilege \u2013 the atmosphere, the fans, the interest that surrounds it. Every time I go out on the pitch I know I've made the right decision.\" The vindication has come in other forms this week. First there was the defeat of Tottenham Hotspur that guaranteed a top-four finish and, at the very least, a place in the Champions League qualifiers. Two days later, it was the club's FA Cup final media day. A decade ago, a press conference at City comprised two or three journalists loitering outside the old training ground on Platt Lane. There were 150 people at the new state-of-the-art base on Thursday, squashed inside a wedding-style marquee. Unlike his passes, Silva was a bit off-message when it came to the FA Cup. He didn't watch it when he was a kid, he said, and he didn't bother with the pretence of trying to remember any previous finals. But he seemed to understand the importance of, potentially, the club's first trophy since 1976. The Copa del Rey, Spain's FA Cup equivalent, can be seen as \"a pain in the arse\", to use the line of Michel Salgado, formerly of Real Madrid and now Blackburn Rovers. \"He might be right,\" Silva says with a smile. \"But I don't think you can make the same comparison here in England because it's always been a big trophy.\" His CV includes being part of the Spain national squads that won the World Cup and the European Championship. Further down the line, City have greater ambitions than the FA Cup. For now Silva has enough of an understanding about the club's history to recognise the significance of this moment. \"It would be just as meaningful for me to win this as anything I have won in the past, in the sense that it's so long since City won a trophy or even got into a final. What we've done this season is very positive. We've got to a final and reached the top four, the Champions League, and I know how important it is for the people who follow this club that we actually win something now \u2013 that first trophy. Then we can continue that upward curve.\" His team-mate Yaya Tour\u00e9 has spoken of City ultimately being as formidable as Barcelona. It felt out of keeping with the direction in which City have tried to move \u2013 ie away from Sir Alex Ferguson's withering assessment of them as \"noisy neighbours\" \u2013 but Silva nods his head. \"What you have to realise about Barcelona is that it hasn't happened overnight. They've been working in the same style for a good number of years now. But it's certainly something we have to be aiming for, and why not?\" Another extensive recruitment programme is expected. Cesc F\u00e1bregas would be Silva's ideal choice. \"If only he could come,\" he says. \"He treats the ball likes it's his best friend.\" He knows, though, it is probably unrealistic, and there is a wince, too, when the subject turns to the possibility of Carlos Tevez leaving. \"He's a vital player for us, the real key player, our captain, a top guy. I feel so at ease with him, so comfortable because he makes things easy for me. It's very important he stays, but at the end of the day it's not my decision.\" Tevez, you imagine, appreciates the former Valencia player just as highly. At the Mestalla, Silva was top of the assist charts for three successive years. Signed for \u00a325m, his first season at Eastlands can be accurately gauged by the three player-of-the-month awards he won in succession from November to January. Up close, the 25-year-old is remarkably slight, with his high cheekbones and sloping shoulders. But nobody talks any more about him being too small to cope with the rigours of the Premier League. \"I was never worried about that,\" he says dismissively. \"There are lots of small footballers out there.\" It probably should not have been an issue in the first place. Luis Aragon\u00e9s once insisted that Silva \u2013 1.67 metres (5ft 6in) and not even 11 stone \u2013 had the \"biggest balls\" in the national team. Which could be useful considering the opposition City will face at Wembley. \"There isn't a Spanish Stoke,\" Silva says. \"There are a few sides in Spain who resort to the long ball occasionally \u2013 but not all the time. They are a big side and play with a lot of aggression. They will be hard to beat, but we have a lot of desire and belief that we can beat them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
