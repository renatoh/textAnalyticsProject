Ferdinand is one of four players chosen. He leaves before taking his test and is later photographed shopping in Manchester city centre. He tells United he forgot the test as he was moving home. September 24 Ferdinand takes and passes an official drugs test. However, his failure to take the original test has invited a probable misconduct charge. October 3 The FA informs Ferdinand by letter that UK Sport has advised it of his failure to attend the original test. October 5 The FA's executive director David Davies meets Ferdinand informally. The England squad announcement for the crucial European Championship qualifier against Turkey, due at 7pm, is delayed by a day. October 6 Ferdinand rejects the chance to move an FA pre-charge \"interview\" forward from the following Monday. The FA postpones the squad announcement again. October 7 Still no meeting with Ferdinand, so the FA tells the England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson the player must be left out. Eriksson says: \"As a football man, I always want the best team. But, when these things happen, there are other people who make those decisions and I have to accept them.\" David Beckham, Michael Owen, Sol Campbell and Gary Neville make clear their reservations at Ferdinand's exclusion. The FA claims talk of strikes is wide of the mark. The England players vote unanimously to threaten a strike if Ferdinand is not recalled. October 8 Talks aimed at averting a strike last all day, despite the players turning up for training. The FA raises the possibility of Euro 2004 elimination if the Turkey fixture does not go ahead. Just before 9pm the FA chief executive Mark Palios reveals the England squad will travel with the threat of strike action over. October 13 Ferdinand attends an FA meeting at a secret location to discuss his missed drugs test. October 29 Ferdinand is charged with misconduct by the FA and given 14 days to respond. November 11 Eriksson reveals his desire to have Rio Ferdinand available for the Euro 2004 finals. November 12 The deadline for Ferdinand to reply to the FA's charge expires but the defender gains another 24 hours as the FA letter arrived late. November 13 The FA announces Ferdinand has formally denied the charge. November 29 Fifa's president Sepp Blatter announces his plan to write to the FA demanding to know why Ferdinand had been allowed to play on. \"How can you now settle this case when he has played and what do you do with the results after that?\" he said. November 30 David Davies confirms players failing to take drug tests could face immediate suspensions. He admits FA rules do not fully cover the failing or refusing of tests. \"No one pretends we are happy with the time it's taken but we have the processes that we have,\" he said. December 4 Manchester United's chief executive David Gill dismisses as \"incomprehensible\" Blatter's suggestion that the team's results with Ferdinand were invalid. December 5 The FA chairman Geoff Thompson hits back at Blatter, telling him not to interfere. \"You don't lock someone up without going through the process,\" said Thompson. December 8 Ferdinand is said to have made telephone contact with doping testers 25 minutes before they left the training ground, offering to return and take the test. In a message relayed through the club doctors the testers told him he was too late. December 18 The first day of the hearing begins in Bolton. December 19 Ferdinand is banned for eight months and fined \u00a350,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
