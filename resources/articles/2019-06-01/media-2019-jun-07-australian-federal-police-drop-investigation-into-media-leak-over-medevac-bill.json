The Australian federal police announced late on Friday afternoon they had dropped their investigation into how the security briefing was leaked to the media. The leaked advice, reported in the Australian, came during a heated political debate in February over the medical transfer bill, which ultimately passed parliament against the government\u2019s wishes. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said Dutton needed to clarify whether he or his office had anything to do with the leak. Albanese said he did not know who was behind the leak but there were curious circumstances around the timing. \u201cQuite clearly that sort of national security advice wasn\u2019t circulating around the [Parliament] on Post-it notes,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney on Saturday. \u201cThe leak [was] on the front page of the newspaper. Peter Dutton gave an interview on the record where he spoke about that national security advice on that day. That was entirely inappropriate for him to do so and he did so too in order to secure a political advantage,\u201d he said. The newspaper report quoting home affairs department advice earned an extraordinary rebuke from Australia\u2019s top spy chief for misrepresenting the advice as coming from Asio. The federal police received a referral from the home affairs department on 7 February to investigate the alleged unauthorised disclosure of protected information. A spokeswoman said it had been assessed according to standard protocols. \u201cDue to the limited prospects of identifying a suspect, it was not accepted for investigation,\u201d an AFP spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cThe AFP considers this matter finalised.\u201d Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, said the decision not to investigate the leak was an \u201cabsolutely breathtaking development\u201d. \u201cIn light of this week\u2019s media raids, many Australian citizens and media outlets will have questions about why some leaks of classified information lead to raids and other leaks do not,\u201d Keneally said. Keneally said a perception of bias was being created whereby only leaks that embarrassed the government were investigated with rigour. \u201cThere is that very real perception of bias and interference, and that problem lies with the government,\u201d she told reporters in Sydney. The federal police have been under fire this week after two days of unprecedented media raids. Officers raided the home of News Corp Australia journalist Annika Smethurst investigating the publication of a leaked proposal to allow government spying on Australians. Then the ABC was targeted over a series of articles the broadcaster ran in 2017 into the clandestine operations of Australian special forces in Afghanistan. The ABC\u2019s chair, Ita Buttrose, has said raids by the federal police on its headquarters were \u201cdesigned to intimidate\u201d and warned the government she would fight \u201cany attempts to muzzle\u201d the national broadcaster. The former journalist and publisher said she had registered her \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the raids on the ABC and News Corp over two days and would not countenance any interference with the public\u2019s right to know. \u201cAn untrammeled media is important to the public discourse and to democracy,\u201d Buttrose said. \u201cIt is the way in which Australian citizens are kept informed about the world and its impact on their daily lives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
