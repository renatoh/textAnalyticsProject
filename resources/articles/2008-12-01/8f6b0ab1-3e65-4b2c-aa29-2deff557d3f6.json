In previous incarnations Robson wore the United captain's armband while helping re-define the parameters of the modern central midfielder's role and, later, urged his Middlesbrough side to victory from the Old Trafford technical area. \"I'd like United to win - I think they can beat Liverpool and Chelsea to the title but they need the three points more than Middlesbrough who are on a bit of a bad run but hopefully not in any real danger of relegation,\" he said. Robson remains friends with Steve Gibson and Keith Lamb, Boro's chairman and chief executive respectively. \"We're still in touch, I get on well with Steve and Keith,\" enthused the former England captain who brought a litany of extrovert talents including Juninho and Fabrizio Ravanelli to The Riverside. What is less well known is that it was largely Robson's idea to establish the Boro Academy which, under Dave Parnaby's skilled stewardship, has produced a stream of talented homegrown young players, most notably Stewart Downing, David Wheater and Adam Johnson. \"Yeah I'm proud of that,\" admitted Robson. \"It's always nice when a structure you devised and set up is so successful but a lot of the credit should also go to Steve, Keith and, especially, Dave Parnaby.\" Robson's managerial career may not have delivered as much as it once promised but, even through the tough times, he never permitted his purist passing principles to be compromised. \"I've got firm beliefs on how football should be played. That's why I love watching United with their composure, passing, movement and constant positional inter-changing,\" he said. \"And why I applaud and admire the type of football Gareth Southgate is trying to play with his very young team at Middlesbrough. They're inconsistent and, because they lack a bit of experience, you never know quite what you're going to get from them but they've got real pace and their passing and movement against Arsenal recently was very good. Gareth is a brave manager.\" Robson sympathises with Southgate's annoyance at attempts to unsettle key Boro players including Stewart Downing, Tuncay and Gary O'Neil. \"The problem is that when someone does well at Middlesbrough, clubs with greater charisma start showing an interest and players can have their heads turned,\" he explained. \"Gareth has got to try and keep his best players but he's got to find out what Stewart Downing really wants. You can't keep a player at all costs - but, if you sell someone as good as Downing, you've got to get the right replacement. And whereas Manchester United now have the perfect balance between youth and experience I feel Gareth could do with a couple of experienced players to help his youngsters.\" If Johnson could arguably take over Downing's left wing habitat, Southgate undeniably requires central midfield reinforcements. Robson admits this is an area where United looked thin earlier in the season. \"Owen Hargreaves's long term injury hasn't helped,\" he said. \"And, like Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick was injured for a while. But Michael's fit and in great form. And I like the look of Anderson, though he's inexperienced in the role. I think he'll develop into a really good midfielder.\" Indeed Robson, who is mightily encouraged by the emergence of Rafael and Jonny Evans in defence, suspects United's sticky start might have lulled their rivals into a false sense of security. \"I think United's squad is stronger than Chelsea's and Liverpool's,\" he said. \"And United play the best football. The only danger is that, if they keep progressing in the Champions League, things might get a bit hectic.\" He believes much may depend on Cristiano Ronaldo. \"Cristiano started slowly after that ankle operation in late summer but I'm convinced he's going to get stronger and stronger as the season goes on,\" Robson said. \"Cristiano Ronaldo will play a big part in the title race.\" Manchester United v Middlesbrough is exclusively live on Setanta Sports 1 on Monday, December 29 at 8pm.
