I am not the only one to say optical projections were involved \u2013 there was recently a show in Rome of the possible methods. A lot is known about his studio: it was painted black and holes were cut in ceilings to let in a source of light, practically describing a camera. No known drawings exist. Recently even the British Museum had a wall plaque describing Brunelleschi as the \"inventor\" of perspective. Western perspective is a law of optics, hence cameras make perspective pictures. He discovered it, most likely through optics. There is an exciting new story from Caravaggio if one begins to take this into account, and possibly a newer history of photography. Yes, life was more violent in his day, but it's a lot less interesting than looking into his methods.
