A conservative who is not conservative enough for some other conservatives, with implications of cowardice and sexual impotence and/or deviance. The term \u201ccuckservative\u201d caught the eye of puzzled observers this week amid the froth of commentary floating around the race to become the Republican nominee for president in 2016. It has been dubbed a sign of a \u201craging civil war\u201d tearing the Republican party apart, \u201cthe GamerGate\u201d of white supremacists, and a meme expressing \u201ca certain kind of contempt\u201d. But the dictionaries have yet to step in, leaving readers to take it apart more or less on their own. The basics are simple: cuckold, a man with an adulterous wife or partner, and conservative, which in context means someone on the spectrum of 21st-century Republican thought. The insult\u2019s most general gist is conservatives accused of bowing to one non-conservative idea or another, eg immigration reform, should feel humiliated, their ideology adulterated. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush is thus accused of cuckservatism for supporting a path to citizenship for immigrants, rather than the \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d to enclose the United States, as endorsed by Donald Trump in last week\u2019s GOP debate. Radio host Rush Limbaugh alluded to the meme in praise of Trump on Wednesday, saying that \u201cif Trump were your average, ordinary, cuckolded Republican, he\u202c would have apologized by now\u201d for criticizing Fox News host Megyn Kelly. In this sense, as it\u2019s used to criticize mainstream Republicans, the insult is an update on the \u201cRino\u201d (\u201cRepublican in name only\u201d). Mostly, the word is used to belittle conservatives for a perceived weakness, for instance as an emasculation of Fox host Bill O\u2019Reilly for \u201cdaring to question\u201d Trump. But \u201ccuckservative\u201d also draws from darker currents of thought on the far, far right. Beyond its plain meaning of infidelity to the cause, the word sounds like an anti-gay slur; the insulter accuses the insulted of sexual insecurity in addition to everything else. Then there\u2019s racial antipathy. The Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors hate groups, links the word to white supremacists and nationalists, and the insult is usually thrown to suggest that white people should only support policies that benefit white people, eg stringent immigration (if any) and drug sentencing laws. Popular conservative commentator Erick Erickson has called out the racist elements who use the word, saying it is \u201ca slur against Christian voters coined by\u202c white supremacists\u201d\u202c. Writing at the Daily Beast, Matt Lewis argues tribalism in the dark corners of the internet is the source of the phenomenon \u2013 the idea that anyone who\u2019s not an explicit racist or a liberal enemy earns the label. A minority are explicit about the racist impulses behind the word. Far-right blogger Alfred W Clark, for instance, wrote last month that \u201chuman biodiversity terrifies the cuckservative, as deep down he has bought into blank-slatism and egalitarianism. The cuckservative would rather just have a Herman Cain or Clarence Thomas poster on his wall than actually have to honestly think about race.\u201d Other bloggers similarly preach a philosophy of victimhood. In the American Renaissance, Gregory Hood writes that true conservatives have been \u201cdeceived, cheated antd [sic] exploited\u201d and that the term has ascended in response to \u201ca perfect storm of anti-white aggression by minorities and the media\u201d. Blogger Mike Cernovich meanwhile gives a recursive bent to his definition of the term: \u201cA cuckservative calls people who use the term \u2018cuckservative\u2019 racist.\u201d Clark and others go farther, averring that white, Gentile support for Israel qualifies a conservative for the label. Because of a shared identity with Israelis, Jewish people cannot be \u201ccuckservatives\u201d, Clark declares, but \u201cthe cuckservative cares more about Israel\u2019s borders than his own\u201d. The word even has a bit of pornography in it. The New Republic noted this week that \u201ccuckold\u201d can allude to a genre of pornography involving husbands who watch their wives have sex with black men. Intentionally or not, the genre plays to fears of black men preying on white women \u2013 an anxiety perhaps most associated with the Ku Klux Klan.
