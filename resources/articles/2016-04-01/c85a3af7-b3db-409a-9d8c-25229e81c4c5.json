This was a super-size series finale with all the best and worst elements of Line of Duty on show. Among the best: the two incredibly tense and brilliantly scripted interrogation scenes. As for the worst: the final 15 minutes, which took a lurch into melodrama that only just paid off. One of the most interesting things about this show is the way it strives so hard to create an air of realism \u2013 the interrogations, the jargon, the integration of real-life events \u2013 only to undercut it all in the name of drama. The final minutes, featuring gunshots in HQ and an amusingly out-of-puff Kate chasing Dot all over an industrial wasteland, were ludicrously over-the-top (although admittedly we wouldn\u2019t blink twice if this were the conclusion to an American cop show). Yet I can\u2019t deny I thoroughly enjoyed the adrenaline shot they provided \u2013 and therein lies the Line of Duty conundrum. It\u2019s clever and tightly plotted, but it\u2019s also addicted to twists and has a tendency to go overboard at the last. That said, I did like the fact that Danny Waldron turned out to be a red herring. Yes, his death sparked the whole investigation and brought Dot down but the story ultimately told was very different from the one suggested at the start. I\u2019m also interested to see where they go from here. One of the best things about this season has been the way it slowly revealed that everything tied together, that there was a wider conspiracy at play. A standalone fourth season would feel slightly out of place given those circumstances. I still have faith in Jed Mercurio, though: after all, he has kept me on the edge of my seat for the past six weeks. The bad guys Farewell to DI Matthew \u201cDot\u201d Cottan: the weasel\u2019s weasel and a man who I always managed to feel slightly sorry for despite his villainy. He started out on top of his game, framing Steve for the murder of Lindsay Denton, slipping in endless snide taunts (\u201cSee, it\u2019s what these coppers do when you\u2019ve got them bang to rights\u201d; \u201cSteve Arnott, golf tee \u2013 I think Danny Waldron was trying to tell us something\u201d) and even having the foresight to get the file he doctored from Steve\u2019s ex-girlfriend Nicola Rogerson, thus further undermining young Arnott. He ended the episode a paranoid mess, haunted by Denton\u2019s ghost, on the run and eventually sacrificing his life to save Kate. Urgent exit required indeed (whatever I might think about the series end, that text was pure genius). Was Dot\u2019s act of sacrifice plausible given how self-serving he\u2019s always appeared? On balance I\u2019d say yes. There\u2019s always been a sense that, like Denton, Dot is as much victim as villain, desperate to escape the world he\u2019s been trapped in since he was a boy. It\u2019s also true that he has made numerous attempts this series to reach out to Kate, as though he saw her as his last chance for an ordinary life. The small moment where she admitted she did want to sleep with him was fascinating, zeroing in as it did on Dot\u2019s surprising air of vulnerability, as was her final speech to him, which suggested that she differentiated between Dot and the \u201cmonsters\u201d he protected. Speaking of monsters, will we ever know who they really are? I kept expecting Dot\u2019s getaway driver to be a big reveal, but in the end he was just another anonymous bad guy. Perhaps that\u2019s Mercurio\u2019s wider point: it\u2019s easy to trap one bad apple, but bringing down the whole barrel is a different, far more difficult game. The good guys Still, if anyone can do it it\u2019s AC-12. With an increasingly distraught Steve under arrest for much of the episode the night belonged to Fleming and Hastings. Kate finally showed her undercover skills, successfully trailing Dot (well done to all the commenters who said she\u2019d save the day) and collecting evidence against him. In truth, it was pretty obvious from early on that she was on Dot\u2019s case \u2013 all that note taking during the first interview, plus the fact that Hastings ordered the trail on Arnott \u2013 but that didn\u2019t make the subsequent night of chasing the paper trail any less enjoyable (then again, I am a sucker for stories where people sift through evidence to catch their man). It was especially great to see the excellent Vicky McClure given more to do \u2013 I loved it when she turned down Dot\u2019s advice to get away with the pragmatic response: \u201cI\u2019m too knackered to run\u201d \u2013 and by the end I felt quite warmly towards DC now DS Fleming, dubious undercover skills and all. Not as warmly as I felt towards superintendent Ted Hastings. From his weary despair over Steve\u2019s arrest \u2013 \u201cGod help me if I ever get a good night\u2019s sleep again\u201d \u2013 to his increasing irritation with the slippery Gill (\u201cEven after the time we\u2019ve spent together, you really don\u2019t know me at all\u201d) Hastings dominated much of the first hour. In a show like this, it\u2019s always useful to have one character that you entirely believe will do the right thing no matter the circumstances. Hastings is that man. Notes and observations Maneet remains the most awesome person on the show, possessing not only backbone and good policing skills but also demonstrating the ability to multi-task late at night with a small baby. Promote her to AC-12 ASAP please. The reveal that Steve had canoodled with Lindsay was one of the few things that bothered me \u2013 would Hastings really allow Steve back to AC-12 when he knows he behaved improperly? I know he has a soft spot for him, but wouldn\u2019t that mean he\u2019d buried evidence? I can\u2019t see Hastings doing that at all. I did, however, feel sorry for Lindsay, her posthumous validation and her bleak funeral no one attended. I even managed to feel sympathy for Steve and his eyebrows thanks to Martin Compston\u2019s emotional turn when Sam dumped him. Did we already know Hari had a gambling problem? I wasn\u2019t sure if Dot just suggested that because it\u2019s his own history or if he appropriated Hari\u2019s story when talking to Kate about his dodgy past. Ted Hastings said \u201cMother of God\u201d twice this week, so I\u2019m calling it: he\u2019s definitely Catholic. No, I have no idea why he joined the freemasons \u2026 perhaps he didn\u2019t, but just refuses to answer any questions about his personal life. I enjoy imagining how many times a day Hastings has to say \u201clike the battle\u201d. There was something splendid about the fact that Nige survived to draw his pension. His survival skills are cockroach-levels of good. Weasel of the week I\u2019m giving it to the fantastically patronising Gill Bigelow, a woman who managed to make the phrase \u201cof course you care\u201d sound like it was coated in poison. Quote of the week \u201cThere\u2019s a line. It\u2019s called right and wrong and I know which side my duty lies, so why don\u2019t you write a nice letter of resignation to the PCC or I swear to god I will drag you down with the rest of them.\u201d Superintendent Ted Hastings lays claim to the last part of my heart. What did you think? Was it a satisfying conclusion or did Mercurio drop the ball? Did Dot\u2019s ending satisfy you or are you picking at loose ends. Finally, thank you to everyone who posted theories, crazy or otherwise, week after week. You\u2019ve made this a joy to write and hopefully see you all back here next time \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
