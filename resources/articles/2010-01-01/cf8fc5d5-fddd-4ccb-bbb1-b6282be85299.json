But that was the only bright spot of another depressing result for the Guinness Premiership, as Toulouse ground out the win they needed to secure a home quarter-final against Stade Fran\u00e7ais and left Sale's director of rugby, Kingsley Jones, identifying finance as a key reason for his team's failure even to qualify for the last eight of the Amlin Challenge Cup. \"We're very disappointed to have finished third in the group but I did say a few months ago that when you're talking about salary caps there has got to be an even playing field,\" said Jones. \"As it stands we can't compete with the Ospreys or the French clubs, and I think the [Cardiff] Blues would have a bigger budget than us as well.\" Toulouse, who Jones believes should now be the favourites to claim their third Heineken Cup given the advantage of staying in France for the rest of the competition, never set out to play like millionaires in conditions that a visiting reporter accurately described as \"frais et pluvieux\" \u2013 given the weather for recent fixtures in Stockport, they should have been grateful there was no glace or neige. Their savvy half-backs, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak and Jean Baptiste Elissalde, took five drop-goal attempts in the first half, with Elissalde's two successes ultimately separating the teams. Two penalties from Charlie Hodgson kept Sale level, a good effort considering they lost Sisa Koyamaibole to the sin-bin, for cleaning out Michalak off the ball, and then Chris Jones for killing the ball in a ruck. But Toulouse upped the pace at the start of the second half and the hooker Virgile Lacombe surged over from a lineout. Elissalde converted and kicked a penalty in an increasingly turgid game. Fortunately, Tait lifted the mood by surging between Toulouse's centres and shrugging off Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud to score. It was never going to be enough for the Sharks, whose chances of claiming the consolation prize of a place in the Challenge Cup had already been ended by Cardiff's romp at Harlequins. But Jones hopes Martin Johnson will give Tait an England run. \"He needs to be given love and shown confidence by the people above him,\" Jones said. \"I'm going reasonably well in attack and defence at the moment, but it's up to Johnno,\" Tait said, getting into his cab.
