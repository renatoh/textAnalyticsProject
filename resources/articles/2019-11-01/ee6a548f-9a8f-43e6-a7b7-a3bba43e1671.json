Txiki Begiristain is responsible for recruitment, with Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus, Aymeric Laporte and Ederson among those bought under the sporting director. \u201cThe most important department is the scouting department, much more than manager and players,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Txiki Begiristain and [others] choose well, 80% is done. When they don\u2019t, you spend a lot of time and energy [trying to redress this]. That\u2019s my feeling.\u201d Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, another brought in under Begiristain, has impressed in the holding role this season with Rodri injured and Fernandinho having to cover in central defence. The German did likewise towards the end of last season and Guardiola admitted to being wrong about G\u00fcndogan\u2019s ability to operate there. \u201cHe\u2019s so intelligent, one of the qualities I appreciate most,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHe can play many roles and especially in that position \u2013 I didn\u2019t expect it; I was wrong. We were unlucky in the first season [with his injuries]. I didn\u2019t expect him to be so consistent as a holding midfielder. He\u2019s exceptional.\u201d Guardiola became convinced when forced to play G\u00fcndogan there. \u201cIt was last season,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it happens when you don\u2019t have an alternative. I didn\u2019t realise how aggressive he is without the ball. Of course he\u2019s not a typical holding midfielder. We didn\u2019t have any doubts about him and his talent, [and] when Fernandinho was injured, he played there and was incredible in all aspects of the game.\u201d Eddie Jones is an admirer of Guardiola, England\u2019s rugby union head coach, having drawn on some aspects of the Catalan\u2019s training techniques. Guardiola is to invite Jones to City. \u201cWe spoke once or twice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was so kind \u2013 it was a pleasure to see him and meet him. I\u2019m a big fan but I don\u2019t understand too much about the sport but I watch on TV. I have asked him how they can regenerate the players like they do after the games. It\u2019s incredible \u2013 how can they survive? I cannot imagine. We spoke about sport, about life, nothing special. \u201cWe didn\u2019t spend too much time together but hopefully they can win and we can invite him and his staff to come here and we can talk more. It would be nice for all of us, especially me. So we wish them luck.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
