Johnson was attacked by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, for failing to appear in Sunday night\u2019s debate, at which he was represented by an empty lectern. \u201cIf his team won\u2019t allow him out to debate with five pretty friendly colleagues, how is he going to cope with 27 EU countries? He should be here to answer that very question,\u201d said Hunt. Much of the leadership contest so far has been dominated by the issue of Brexit, which produced some of the strongest clashes in the Channel 4 debate. But nine years after the Conservatives came to power in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, all five men also used the platform to set out their priorities for renewing their country and their party. Hunt, who was health secretary for six years, said fixing Britain\u2019s broken social care system was \u201cunfinished business\u201d, and promised to tackle what he called the \u201cnational blind spot\u201d of illiteracy, saying: \u201cA quarter of primary school leavers are unable to read or write properly.\u201d Rory Stewart, who came seventh in the first round of voting last week, also highlighted the state of social care. \u201cIt\u2019s a real disgrace: it\u2019s the unfinished revolution of our society,\u201d the international development secretary said. \u201cIt is that on which our civilisation should be tested \u2013 and it is that which I would make my central priority.\u201d Michael Gove said he wanted to do more for children in care, and raised concerns about young people leaving university burdened with debt, suggesting the student loans system should be \u201clooked at\u201d. \u201cIt seems to me tragic that when I think of the next generation of children, that they will leave university with debt, they will find it more difficult to have a home of their own; it seems as though their horizons are narrowing just as the world is opening up,\u201d the environment secretary said. And in an echo of Tony Blair\u2019s \u201ctough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\u201d catchphrase, Gove suggested: \u201cOur approach to knife crime should not just be about law and order \u2013 it should be about love and hope.\u201d Sajid Javid praised public services, saying: \u201cLike 90% of the population, I relied on public services to get me where I am.\u201d The home secretary also called for more investment in education. Dominic Raab said he would boost degree-level apprenticeships and cut taxes for the lowest-paid. And despite the public pleas of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for candidates not to abandon the Tories\u2019 reputation for fiscal prudence, no one mentioned tackling the deficit. Raab was repeatedly challenged by all four of his rivals for refusing to rule out suspending parliament if he considered it necessary to press ahead with a no-deal Brexit \u2013 something he said must be kept on the table. \u201cThe minute we telegraph to the EU that we\u2019re not willing to walk away at the end of October, come what may, we lose the best shot at a deal,\u201d the former Brexit secretary said. But Javid told him: \u201cYou don\u2019t deliver democracy by trashing democracy \u2013 we\u2019re not choosing a dictator, we\u2019re choosing a PM.\u201d And Hunt said the idea was a \u201cfundamental misreading of what parliament stands for, and what the people in this country would accept\u201d. Javid, who will need to win over extra support if he is to remain in the race after Tuesday\u2019s second round of voting, painted himself as a fresh face from a different background who could communicate better with non-Tory voters. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have someone that can unite people \u2013 and my own background, my life experience is very different from Conservative leaders of the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not from central casting.\u201d Stewart, whose quixotic campaign has involved walking around Britain meeting the public, received a warm response from the studio audience of floating voters, including when he complained that the contest has become a \u201ccompetition of machismo\u201d over Brexit. He also took a swipe at Johnson by saying of his rivals in the studio: \u201cI hope it\u2019s one of us who becomes prime minister.\u201d And after the debate, he won the backing of business minister Margot James, who had previously supported Matt Hancock. She described him as \u201cenergetic, determined and embracing the centre ground\u201d. Stewart claimed he was the candidate who could win over backers of other parties at a future general election. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of the fact that Labour and Lib Dem voters say they would vote for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something to be proud of, and I think we need to work to listen to each other, and above all to bring this country together.\u201d One member of the audience asked the candidates about their greatest weakness. Raab called himself a \u201crestless soul\u201d, Javid said he was too stubborn, and Gove that he was too impatient. Johnson, who is the overwhelming frontrunner, had declined an invitation to take part in the debate, and is not expected to join a hustings with Westminster journalists on Monday either. But he will join a BBC debate on Tuesday evening, after the second round of voting, when the field will have been slimmed down. The least popular candidate will be eliminated after Tuesday\u2019s ballot among MPs \u2013 as will any contender who does not meet a threshold of 33 supporters, set by the backbench 1922 Committee. Only Johnson, Hunt and Gove achieved that target last week. Others have spent the weekend trying to win over erstwhile supporters of Hancock, who withdrew after scoring 20 votes in the first round. Hancock himself, who pitched himself as the right candidate to \u201cturn the page\u201d on Brexit, announced on Sunday night that he was backing Johnson after holding meetings with all the other candidates on Friday and Saturday. Writing in the Times, Hancock said he felt Johnson had the best chance of uniting the party and the country and would lead as a one-nation prime minister because \u201cthat\u2019s how he ran London \u2013 consistently \u2013 for eight years\u201d. He added: \u201cI have repeatedly argued for a strategy of defeating the danger of [Nigel] Farage by delivering Brexit and defeating the danger of [Jeremy] Corbyn by dominating the centre ground thereafter. That is Boris\u2019s plan and I wholeheartedly endorse it.\u201d Some moderate Tory MPs had hoped for a \u201cstop Johnson dream ticket\u201d, but talks on joining forces foundered. \u201cRory, Michael, Saj and Matt all agreed they should band together \u2013 but each of them thought it was him that people should unite around,\u201d said one senior Tory. Further rounds of voting will be held on Wednesday \u2013 and on Thursday, if necessary \u2013 to weed the field down to just two men, whose names will then go forward to Conservative party members. The result will be announced in the week beginning 21 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
