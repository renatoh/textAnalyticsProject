Where I live, Coogee Beach in Sydney. Nothing better than to have a beautiful white sand beach at your doorstep. Particularly at this time of the year when there aren't hoards of people descending on us - the time of year we locals love the best! What draws you to it? Coogee, while busy, still has a great community feel and I enjoy knowing the guys in the local butchers, the restaurant and caf\u00e9 owners, and locals who treat me as one of them and don't make a fuss about me being someone who is in the public eye. It is a short drive or bus trip to Sydney's CBD and is close to the centres of two of my favourite pastimes: horse racing and Aussie Rules football. Royal Randwick Racecourse will open their fabulous new grandstand complex in the spring and will make race going even more of a pleasure. The home of my footy team, the Sydney Swans is at the Sydney Cricket Ground. It's quicker for me to get a bus to these two venues than it is to drive and park \u2013 which means I can have a safe drink or two as well! My favourite cinema, the Randwick Ritz, is just up the road within walking distance, and Fox Studios are nearby at Moore Park. Are there particular memories it brings to mind? The first time I saw Coogee was when I first did the Bondi to Coogee walk along the cliffs of the eastern seaboard - a fabulous walk. Getting over the hill from Clovelly and seeing Coogee for the first time reminded me of Tom Roberts' famous painting of Coogee Bay which is in the Art Gallery of NSW and I thought \"I'd love to live here.\" And now I do. This is the time of the year when whales are migrating north to calve and I remember one year, when the whales were migrating back south in the spring, a whale and her calf rested in the bay only a few hundred metres off shore. They were completely at peace, oblivious of the thousands of sightseers who flocked to the beach that day. How would you spend your perfect day there? It would have to be a Saturday. In the morning I'd walk around the cliffs with my wife Linda (weather permitting!), and probably breakfast at Ceviche or Barzura at my end of the beach. Then I'd do a small workout at the Coogee Diggers' gym and head off to the races at Randwick or a Swannies game at the SCG, depending which was on. The evening would be dinner with Linda and friends at Bananapalm, La Spiaggia or any one of the great restaurants we have within walking distance! Any recommendations? Try the walk south towards Maroubra and, if the weather is right, have a swim in the fabulous old deco saltwater Wylie's Baths. Walk back up to the Northern headland and quietly reflect at the memorial to the victims of the Bali bombings. Then go and have a drink and a meal at any one of our great cafes and celebrate how good it is to be alive!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
