City officials called it a health hazard, a nasty stew of human excrement, rotting food, used needles, rats. Dozens of men and women with nowhere else to go called it home. On Tuesday, it was eliminated in San Francisco\u2019s latest official homeless sweep. On 23 February, the city declared the sprawling encampment a \u201cpublic health nuisance\u201d and gave its residents 72 hours to depart. Many of those living in upwards of 200 tents gathered their belongings and left under their own steam. On Tuesday, what tents remained were cleared away. For the last week and a half, the city\u2019s Department of Public Works has been clearing debris along Division Street, and the health department has done \u201cintensive outreach\u201d with the 200 to 300 residents of this urban shanty town, said Rachel Gordon, San Francisco public works spokeswoman. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had rain for four years, but with the recent rains, people come under the freeway\u201d for shelter, Gordon said, as the last holdouts folded tarps and packed up. \u201cWe have about 50 crew members to clean the streets and make them sanitary. \u201cWorkers have cleaned up lots of urine, feces, discarded used needles, vermin. One of our crew members opened a tent about a week ago and about half a dozen rats ran out.\u201d San Francisco has struggled with homelessness for decades; at the last biennial count in 2015, the homeless population was estimated at about 7,000, and mayor Edwin M Lee has pledged to continue spending $250m annually on \u201chomeless prevention and solutions.\u201d The issue has gained increased attention lately, as Super Bowl events displaced many homeless people from Market Street, and a wealthy tech entrepreneur wrote an open letter to the city bemoaning the fact that he had worked hard and shouldn\u2019t have to witness poverty on a daily basis. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to worry about being accosted,\u201d Justin Keller, founder of a startup web business called Commando.io, wrote to Lee and police Chief Greg Suhr. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to see the pain, struggle and despair of homeless people to and from my way to work every day.\u201d On Tuesday, 39-year-old Ashante Jones helped his wife and friends as they broke camp across from a Best Buy, as traffic whizzed along and police officers stood watch. He said he had been living on the sidewalk there for the past 70 days, as preparations for Super Bowl moved homeless people away from downtown. As the cleanup bustled around her, a defeated-looking Jodie Coombes, 39, sat in front of a blue tent that had been pitched on a wooden platform and filled with belongings. She has been homeless since 2007, when her family moved out of state. \u201cI stayed behind,\u201d she said. \u201cI was on parole and not able to leave the state. I\u2019ve been here a year or so in this general location. It sucks. It really does. Where do they expect us to go? You know what I mean? It\u2019s hard out here. \u201cThey want us to move,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe resources are there, but they don\u2019t give them to everybody.\u201d When asked where she would go now that the latest city cleanup was rousting her encampment, she paused. \u201cHonestly?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
