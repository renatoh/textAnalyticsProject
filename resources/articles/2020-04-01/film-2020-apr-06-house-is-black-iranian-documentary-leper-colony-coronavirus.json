Regarded as a precursor to the Iranian new wave and now considered a classic, The House Is Black is a documentary about the members of a leper colony near the city of Tabriz in northwest Iran. Despite having been filmed nearly 60 years ago, and focusing on a small group of people suffering from a particular condition, it has found new relevance in the age of the coronavirus pandemic, having much to say not only about the current situation in Iran but also to those in self-isolation and/or suffering, regardless of location. Farrokhzad\u2019s short film is anything but an easy watch. Ebrahim Golestan, its producer (who was in a secret relationship with Farrokhzad at the time) states this explicitly at the start. \u201cOn this screen,\u201d he says, \u201cwill appear an image of ugliness, a vision of pain no caring human being should ignore.\u201d This echoes the sentiments of the poet Sa\u2019di of Shiraz, who in the 13th century famously declared: \u201cYou who are indifferent to the misery of others cannot be called a human being.\u201d Golestan\u2019s \u201cugliness\u201d, however, turns out to be something of a euphemism. While some of Farrokhzad\u2019s subjects are being treated for leprosy at an early stage, others haven\u2019t been as fortunate. In the first scene, a girl regards what is exposed of her mutilated face in a mirror. Elsewhere a blind, noseless man handles a cigarette with mere stubs for fingers. Farrokhzad does not, however, treat any of them as anomalies or grotesques but as people; and her empathy is accentuated by her passionate readings of her poetry. \u201cLet us listen to the soul,\u201d she says, \u201cwho sings in the remote desert, the one who sighs and stretches his hands out, saying, \u2018Alas, my wounds have numbed my spirit.\u2019\u201d In his preface, Golestan says that the motive and hope of the film is \u201cto wipe out this ugliness and relieve the victims\u201d; but The House Is Black is a little more complex than that. According to Nasrin Rahimieh, professor of comparative literature at the University of California, Farrokhzad told Bernardo Bertolucci that \u201cshe saw the leper colony as an example or a model of a world imprisoned by its illnesses, difficulties, and poverty\u201d. Rahimieh suggests that \u201clife in the leper colony is a metaphor for life in general\u201d. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian studies and comparative literature at Columbia University, and Roxanne Varzi, a professor of anthropology and film at the University of California, suggest, respectively, that the film reflects the \u201cbrutalised history\u201d of Iran, and serves as a metaphor for \u201cthe Shah\u2019s oppressive social policies and a critique of the practice of religion at the time\u201d. The House Is Black has taken on even more meaning in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. For one, it can make those self-isolating appreciate what they have. Our pandemic will pass, but for the quarantined patients in the film, especially those with advanced leprosy, illness and isolation from the rest of society are facts of life. They have no recovery to look forward to, passing out their days in a slow decay. \u201cI am poured out like water \u2026 as those who have long been dead,\u201d Farrokhzad says in her voiceover. \u201cOn my eyelids is the shadow of death.\u201d That said, there is some light in the film: children giggle at school and while playing football, dealing with the situation as best they can, while other patients are shown making merry at a wedding. The film\u2019s contrasting of scenes in a hospital in which Golestan discusses the treatment of leprosy, with those of fatalistic worshippers submitting to the will of God in a mosque, says volumes about the conflicting attitudes of and towards science and religion in Iran. On that note, the \u201chouse\u201d in the film (ie, the colony) can certainly stand as a metaphor for coronavirus-era Iran: a pariah nation battling a pandemic under crippling US sanctions costing ordinary Iranians their lives at an alarming rate. In perhaps the film\u2019s most harrowing scene, a schoolboy is asked to write a sentence on the blackboard with the word \u201chouse\u201d. He thinks to himself before scrawling with his damaged fingers: \u201cThe house is black.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
