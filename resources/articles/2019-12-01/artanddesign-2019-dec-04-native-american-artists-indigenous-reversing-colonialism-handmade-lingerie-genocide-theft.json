Her face is daubed with thick white paint, and she is looking back over her shoulder. On her head is a beaver-skin hat, tangled with feathers and blood-red ribbon. In front of her, the Canadian prairie stretches off into the distance. This photograph, shot at the evocatively named Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump in Alberta, is the work of Meryl McMaster, one of a new generation of indigenous North American artists. Edge of a Moment, as the work is called, shows McMaster at the site where, for thousands of years, the indigenous inhabitants of the prairies drove entire herds of buffalo over the cliffs, producing meat and material at a scale unequalled anywhere else on the continent. Here, the remains of tens of millions of animals lie closely packed under the soil, a tangled vein of broken bones stretching 12 metres down. As Immense As the Sky, McMaster\u2019s first UK solo show, is about to open at Birmingham\u2019s Ikon Gallery, starting a string of exhibitions aiming to wake the UK up to indigenous and Native American art. Like the landscape she captures, McMaster\u2019s photographs feel loaded with meaning, her meticulously constructed outfits and props suggesting complex stories of exploitation, migration, place and heritage. They\u2019re performance, fable, self-portrait and landscape photography all rolled into one. \u201cWith the titles,\u201d she says, \u201cI try to hint at a direction the viewer could think about. It\u2019s not a secretive process. I\u2019m creating dreamlike, theatrical imagery.\u201d McMaster is of Plains Cree heritage and a member of the Siksika First Nation. The Cree, with 220,000 members, are the largest group of First Nations in Canada, with territories ranging from east of Hudson Bay to the far west of Alberta, where they adopted the buffalo-hunting culture of the Plains in the early 1700s. Although she was born and raised in Ottawa, McMaster\u2019s roots lie in the western prairie near Saskatoon. Her father, Gerald, is an artist and curator who grew up in the Red Pheasant Nation reserve in Saskatchewan; her mother is of European-Canadian heritage. \u201cI feel like I have two homes, very different landscapes that inform my sense of self. That connection to the outdoors has found its way into my work.\u201d Captured across Canada, including at early settlements in Ontario and Newfoundland, her work revolves around landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an equal subject within my images,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be listening to stories in my home community, from knowledge-keepers or family members, and it\u2019ll be about a specific landscape. Then that story will influence a costume. With my Cree heritage, I was brought up to respect the land we stand on and everything that lives among us.\u201d The Ikon show comes at a time of increasing awareness of how indigenous peoples are represented in museums. In April, the Bristol Museum returned human remains to representatives of the Tongva, who originally lived on the Channel Islands off California. Meanwhile, the American Museum near Bath is adding to its collection of contemporary Native American art \u2013 and next year will see Settlement come to fruition, a vast project aiming to mark the 400th anniversary of the pilgrims\u2019 journey from Plymouth to the New World. From July, 27 North American indigenous artists will occupy Pounds House and the surrounding grounds in Plymouth\u2019s Central Park for four weeks. The project takes its inspiration from the word settlement: the fact that it can mean a habitation, but also a resolution to a dispute or conflict. The work of these artists will provide a timely echo of a protest made by the American Indian Movement on the 350th anniversary of the pilgrims\u2019 journey. Led by the activist, actor and writer Russell Means, AIM members seized a replica of the Mayflower in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on Thanksgiving Day 1970. \u201cWe\u2019re literally building a settlement,\u201d says Cannupa Hanska Luger, the artist behind the event, which will blend performance, installation, film, poetry and dance to form a \u201creverse colonial experience\u201d intended to make the inhabitants of a colonising country think about the effect this has on the colonised. Raised on the Standing Rock Reservation in South Dakota, Luger is of Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, Lakota, Austrian and Norwegian descent. He uses ceramics, video, sound, steel and paper to tell stories about modern indigenous life. A show from 2013 involved the creation of ornate clay models of boomboxes themed around cliches of indigenous America, which were then publicly smashed and the fragments put on display. Luger is best known, however, for his Mirror Shield Project, which provided instructions, via a video tutorial, for creating shields for protestors at Standing Rock during the Dakota Pipeline controversy. The shields were designed to protect the indigenous people who were defending their land \u2013 and also to humanise the armoured police there, by reflecting their image back at them, forcing them to see themselves as the protesters did. \u201cI was hesitant at first, because it was tied to the whole Mayflower myth,\u201d says Luger of Settlement, referring to the belief that the narratives around the pilgrims and the Thanksgiving tradition have sanitised genocide, theft and appropriation. \u201cBut as I started to think about it, I also thought, \u2018Who tells this story?\u2019 I decided it would be important to actually describe the 21st-century experience in relation to the last 400 years of colonialism \u2013 and how that will alleviate any romantic ideas of native people embedded in the UK and Europe.\u201d Discussing the problem of exhibiting in Europe, Luger says: \u201cIt seems like every time I go somewhere or exhibit work, somebody says, \u2018You don\u2019t look Native American to me.\u2019 You know what I\u2019m saying? I tell them they\u2019re basing their expectation on these romantic ideas of what native people look like.\u201d The torchbearer for contemporary Native American art in the UK has been Rainmaker Gallery in Bristol. Its latest show, Pattern, explores the recurring presence of pattern in indigenous cultures. It features the work of Jordan Ann Craig, who is also exhibiting at the October Gallery in London. Craig, an artist of Cheyenne heritage, grew up in northern California. Her print work \u2013 a series of striking abstract patterns influenced by traditional Cheyenne design \u2013 is typified by Red-Orange Dyed Quills, which references the tradition of quill work. Reducing these traditional patterns to their barest forms, Craig uses a colour palette influenced by the natural dyes of the plains. The prints may be a nod to a time when quills were gathered by first tossing blankets over porcupines, and then dyed with evocative natural ingredients such as two-eyed berry, wolf moss, buffaloberry, sunflower, chokecherry, pine bark, hickory nut and wild grape. The results are striking, fresh and very modern. With her sister Madison, Craig also runs Shy Natives, which uses fashion to empower indigenous women. The sisters work with photographers, film-makers, poets, models, artists and musicians to create handmade lingerie and apparel that combat the sexualisation and stereotyping of indigenous peoples. \u201cBeing native-run is fundamental to our purpose and identity,\u201d says Craig, who wants \u201cto communicate bigger messages about culture, story, and resilience.\u201d McMaster, in another image called At the Edge of This Immensity, poses on Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron: she has a boat loaded with birds on her shoulder. The work was inspired by the stories of her Dutch forebears, a branch of her family that came to North America via New York before fleeing the American Revolution to Canada. \u201cStanding on these cliffs at Gore Bay,\u201d she says, \u201cthinking about the journey that my family took traveling into this unknown land, thinking about this great migration that many people did, I feel time collapsing \u2013 and a connection with my family members whose journeys led me to being here today.\u201d As Immense As the Sky is at Ikon, Birmingham, from 4 December to 23 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
