So much so that in the North Sea, an area that once teemed with fish, cod stocks are now running dangerously low. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (Ices) - a group of marine scientists who specialise in the North Atlantic - has released its annual survey of fish stocks. It recommends a minimum cod stock size of 150,000 tonnes in the North Sea. Alarmingly, the current stock is estimated to be less than one-third of that figure, at just 46,000 tonnes. The figures show a similar tale for Irish Sea cod, as well as sharp declines in Bay of Biscay hake and North Sea plaice numbers. The obvious solution, recommended by Ices, is a complete ban on cod and hake fishing in 2005, along with steep cuts in plaice catches. A year's respite from the predatory trawler fleets of Europe will help those stocks recover. But so far, the European Union's fishery ministries have declined to take such dramatic action, other than limiting catches and trawler activity. They argue the impact on communities relying on fishing would be too great to sustain a one-year pause. Meanwhile, the fishing industry claims stocks are higher than those reported, based on its experience. The scientists counter that there is no sign of a recovery in numbers, and that there is substantial under-reporting of catches. Only a total ban will get around this - and EU ministers should take action. A ban on cod fishing would have a huge impact. But the alternatives are stark. Continued exploitation of the North Sea cod stocks runs an appreciable risk of destroying them. That would have a far greater impact on fishing communities than a one-year moratorium, and bring environmental consequences that can only be guessed at. A one-year ban would certainly require EU funds to bail out the fishing industry, but the price tag would be relatively small - compared with the cost of the common agricultural policy, a drop in the ocean. The Ices survey is not all bad news for the fishing industry - North Sea haddock stocks are flourishing. So even if cod was off the menu, there will still be haddock to be caught. Some recent research suggests that haddock can learn over time how to slip through fishing nets, with younger fish picking up the trick from crafty older fish. George Bush's dream of human-fish harmony may be closer than we think."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
