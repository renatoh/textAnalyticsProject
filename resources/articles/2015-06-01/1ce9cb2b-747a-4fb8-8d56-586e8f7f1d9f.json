The video is the artist\u2019s first major work since the conclusion in May of her almost yearlong performance art piece, Mattress Performance: Carry That Weight. The video called Ceci N\u2019est Pas Un Viol, French for \u201cThis Is Not a Rape\u201d, is hosted on a website created by Emma Sulkowicz. Introductory text for the video contains a trigger warning: \u201cThe following text contains allusions to rape. Everything that takes place in the following video is consensual but may resemble rape.\u201d Sulkowicz and her mattress became a powerful symbol of the movement to reform campus sexual assault proceedings after she decided to carry it around the university for her visual arts senior thesis. Sulkowicz accused Paul Nungesser, a fellow Columbia graduate, of raping her in August 2012, during her sophomore year. She reported the incident to school officials, who investigated the incident. Nungesser was later cleared by a campus tribunal and has maintained that the encounter was consensual. However, Sulkowicz vowed to carrythe mattress across the university\u2019s New York campus and into classes until the school expelled Nungesser. The university did not expel him, and instead, Sulkowicz ended the performance piece by hoisting the mattress one last time to carry it across the stage at the university\u2019s graduation ceremony in May. Nungesser is suing the university, its president and an art professor, alleging that the school enabled a harassment campaign. Sulkowicz has said the sex she had with Nungesser began consensually, but then turned violent. The video echoes her account of that night in August 2012: though Sulkowicz says it is not a re-enactment, she does appear in the video. Of the video, Sulkowicz writes: Ceci N\u2019est Pas Un Viol is not about one night in August, 2012. It\u2019s about your decisions, starting now. It\u2019s only a reenactment if you disregard my words. It\u2019s about you, not him. Do not watch this video if your motives would upset me, my desires are unclear to you, or my nuances are indecipherable. You might be wondering why I\u2019ve made myself this vulnerable. Look\u2014I want to change the world, and that begins with you, seeing yourself. If you watch this video without my consent, then I hope you reflect on your reasons for objectifying me and participating in my rape, for, in that case, you were the one who couldn\u2019t resist the urge to make Ceci N\u2019est Pas Un Viol about what you wanted to make it about: rape. Please, don\u2019t participate in my rape. Watch kindly. In the text accompanying the video, Sulkowicz also asks viewers to reflect on a series of questions: \u201cAre you searching for proof? Proof of what?\u201d \u201cDo you desire pleasure? Do you desire revulsion? Is this to counteract your unconscious enjoyment? What do you want from this experience?\u201d \u201cHow well do you think you know me? Have we ever met?\u201d \u201cDo you refuse to see me as either a human being or a victim? If so, why? Is it to deny me agency and thus further victimize me? If so, what do you think of the fact that you owe your ability to do so to me, since I\u2019m the one who took a risk and made myself vulnerable in the first place?\u201d The video\u2019s director, artist Ted Lawson, told ArtNet News that they filmed the video a few months ago, during Sulkowicz\u2019s winter break. He said Sulkowicz got his contact information from performance artist Marina Abramovi\u0107. While collaborating on a separate project, Lawson said Sulkowicz suggested the video and asked him to direct it. \u201cIt was a super risky piece and I thought very courageous, so of course I agreed,\u201d Lawson told ArtNet News. \u201cI think it came out quite good.\u201d The video, which went live on Wednesday, is temporarily down, though Sulkowicz said her team is working to restore it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
