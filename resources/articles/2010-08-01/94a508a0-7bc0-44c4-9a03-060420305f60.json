As crimson light soaks through a strong still sky, the shadows thicken. The day has been damp and close, full of ripening blackberries and hogweed seeds; edgy as stinging nettles and the caterwauling of young peregrines over the quarry. Now the nights are drawing in and the tide that brings the combine harvesters out into the fields draws an autumnal feeling from the land. Head high and bounding, a fox crosses from derelict remains of daylight through hedges and into the lush darkness of the wood. The last jays and the first owls call from treetops as clucking blackbirds signal lockdown for creatures of the light. Soft moth wings swipe my face as I step from wood's edge into the gateway to the west. The sky is streaked a harebell blue bordered by textual lines of lead-grey clouds around panes of pale amber. I look north-west into the darkening to where we've been today. Out of sight from here, Chirk's stone fortress squats knee-high in the Berwyn mountains, spitting distance from Offa's Dyke, brooding on its history \u2013 now softened by the selective amnesia of heritage and its beautiful gardens, which rival their more famous neighbours in the region. From Chirk Castle garden's edge, we watched the landscape roll east and south to the Shropshire hills. We traced the dark line of Wenlock Edge back to where I'm standing now. By eye, the distance from Chirk to here seems far less than the distance from here to Chirk. Perhaps in cultural terms, the Welsh hills are farther from the Edge \u2013 a distant land \u2013 whereas in the old contested border country, the eastern lines may feel all too close. No matter. Darkness brings its own maps and sleep to the roosts of birds which will redefine the daylight world again tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
