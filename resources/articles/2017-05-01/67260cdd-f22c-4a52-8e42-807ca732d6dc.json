The 34-year-old\u2019s involvement was a small but clear signal of reassurance to fans of the source material: this was an adaptation to trust. Next Sunday, British fans will get a chance to judge whether their faith was well placed as The Handmaid\u2019s Tale arrives on Channel 4. In the US, the series has been rapturously received, hailed by the New York Times as \u201cunflinching, vital and scary as hell\u201d. The biggest plaudits, however, were saved for Moss, who plays Offred, the title\u2019s handmaid and a woman reduced by a repressive and patriarchal society into sexual enslavement, her old name removed, her new one the signifier of her owner, making her literally Of-Fred. The Boston Globe was impressed: \u201cWith The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Moss establishes herself as one of TV\u2019s best dramatic actresses.\u201d In truth, she\u2019d done that already. Twice. As Peggy Olson, the dowdy Catholic secretary turned go-getting copy chief on Mad Men, Moss became the no-nonsense heroine for a generation of cable TV watchers. Then, with Mad Men coming to an end, Moss ensured she would not be consumed by the role that defined her. Going to New Zealand, she took the lead in Jane Campion\u2019s bleak, bruising Top of the Lake, a dark, dense story about a violent, closed-off community, which returns for a second series this summer. Moss will again play troubled detective Robin Griffith, with Campion full of praise for her star: \u201cShe does a very Elisabeth Moss thing, which is\u2026 show strength and vulnerability at once, and also mystery.\u201d Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner was more succinct, stating in a Guardian profile that the only two things you need to know about Moss were that she \u201cnever gives a bad take and is a rubbish drinker\u201d. Small wonder New York magazine recently named her \u201cthe Queen of Peak TV\u201d. The down-to-earth and outwardly easy-going Moss prefers to play down the praise. \u201cI wish I was super-serious, anguished. I see those actors and I am like, oh God, they are so cool and they seem so interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t take acting that seriously. I love my work but I do not think that I am saving the world... I am a Valley Girl.\u201d She wasn\u2019t entirely joking, although beneath the sunny exterior lurks a more complicated soul. She was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1982 and grew up in Laurel Canyon. Her British father, Ron, was a jazz musician and music manager, her American mother, Linda, a harmonica player in blues bands. She and her younger brother, Derek, were raised in a relaxed environment where the arts had more value than a traditional education. \u201cMy earliest memories are at the Blue Note in New York or backstage at different theatres or different clubs,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWe grew up with musicians coming over jamming. We had tons of instruments. So holidays were always like, 50 people would come over and there would be a jam session with everyone playing jazz. When I was 12 I didn\u2019t know about Nirvana or Oasis or any of those people. I was listening to Ella Fitzgerald and Gershwin.\u201d There was, however, a strange wrinkle in this idyllic picture of bohemian freedom \u2013 the family were Scientologists and Moss, raised in the church, remains in it today. \u201cI feel it has given me a sanity and a stability that I\u2019m not sure I would necessarily have had,\u201d she told the Times in 2010. In recent years, perhaps mindful of reputation (hers and the church\u2019s), she has become more reticent about her religion: \u201cI said what it meant to me and anyone can go and look at that if they want to know what I feel. But now it\u2019s private, off limits.\u201d If Scientology and music were two crucial poles of her upbringing, the third, and in some ways most important, was ballet. As a child, she pursued dual careers, taking roles in commercials and made-for-TV movies while training as a dancer. At 15, she chose acting, noting it was the easier option. It was certainly the right one. By 17, she was playing the daughter of the president (Martin Sheen) in The West Wing; by 19, she had moved to New York to star in a play; at 23, having already been acting professionally for more than a decade, she was cast as Peggy in Mad Men. \u201cIn my mind, there was something far more difficult than acting, which was either ballet or music,\u201d she told the Independent in an attempt to explain why her work came so naturally to her. \u201cYou have to practise for hours every day. And that\u2019s how you make it. That kind of discipline was very grounding.\u201d She is an actress of great control who can say a lot while seeming to do very little and whose performances Campion describes as \u201ccoming from the inside out\u201d. Yet alongside this restraint comes a natural warmth, which makes even the most closed-off character appear sympathetic. It\u2019s a skill that has stood her in particularly good stead on The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, where Offred hides her resistance to the new regime behind the blank face she presents to the world. She can snap quickly out of a role once off stage and in the wings. \u201cI barely hang on to it while we\u2019re filming,\u201d she admitted to New York magazine. \u201cI am totally that person that they yell \u2018cut\u2019 and I\u2019m making jokes and doing stupid stuff. It\u2019s fake to me to be any other way.\u201d Away from the camera, she is relaxed and a little goofy with a reputation as a joker. \u201cShe\u2019s not one of those actresses who is walking around with her headphones on listing to Nine Inch Nails to get into a scene,\u201d Mark Duplass, who worked with her on The One I Love, told New York magazine. \u201cShe\u2019s joking around causally and then you yell \u2018action\u2019 and her heartbeat goes up to 150 beats per minute.\u201d Having spent most of her life working, she admits to being occasionally emotionally naive; in an otherwise lighthearted Q&amp;A, she stated that her biggest secret was \u201cI tend to fall in love a little bit too easily sometimes\u201d. A short, unhappy marriage to comedian Fred Armisen, which lasted less than a year amid reports that Armisen thought he was marrying Peggy Olson, not Elizabeth Moss, seems to highlight that truth. \u201cLooking back, I feel like I was really young,\u201d she told New York magazine. \u201cIt was extremely traumatic and awful and horrible. At the same time, it turned out for the best. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not there. I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t happen when I was 50. Like, that\u2019s probably not going to happen again.\u201d Perhaps because of this she now prefers a quiet life, renting apartments in New York\u2019s Upper West Side and West Hollywood, LA, and hanging out at a handful of familiar haunts. She says she prefers staying in watching TV to going out but is also a committed shopper. \u201cWhenever she likes something, be it food or clothes or shoes, she orders heaps of it,\u201d noted Campion. \u201cI remember her apartment in New Zealand was piled with boxes. She does girly-girl very well.\u201d A self-described \u201ccard-carrying feminist\u201d, Moss ran in trouble last month after appearing to suggest that The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was a story about \u201chuman\u201d rather than \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d. Always sensitive to perceptions, she was quick to clarify, stressing that she had merely wanted to highlight \u201cthe different problems we are facing \u2013 the infringements on a lot of different human rights OBVIOUSLY, all caps, it\u2019s a feminist story\u201d. It was a rare misstep from a preternaturally poised actress and unlikely to be repeated in the near future. THE MOSS FILES Born Elisabeth Singleton Moss in Los Angeles, California, 24 July 1982. Her parents were both musicians and she was raised a Scientologist. Best of times As Mad Men\u2019s Peggy Olson, she was nominated six times for a best actress Emmy. She has yet to win. Worst of times A whirlwind romance with Fred Armisen resulted in a marriage that collapsed in under a year. What she says \u201cWhen someone puts up the gif of Peggy walking down the hall with the box and the cigarette and connects it to International Women\u2019s Day or the Hillary Clinton campaign, I\u2019m always like, \u2018Damn, that\u2019s so cool\u2019.\u201d What they say \u201cShe\u2019s a little bit like a Mona Lisa. There\u2019s a lot that she\u2019s not showing you.\u201d Jane Campion"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
