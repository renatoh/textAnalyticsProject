The Labour leader said: \u201cObviously I\u2019m very sorry for what has happened,\u201d after being asked to apologise directly by presenter Phillip Schofield, in an interview on ITV\u2019s This Morning. Corbyn has previously apologised for antisemitic incidents involving party members but during the general election campaign he has been dogged by criticism that has not said sorry again when he has been given the opportunity. He declined to apologise four times during an interview with the BBC presenter Andrew Neil. In an exchange with Schofield, who said he was giving him the opportunity to say sorry, Corbyn at first spoke about ways he has tried to improve the way incidents are dealt with. Asked if he would apologise, Corbyn said: \u201cOur party \u2026 can I make it clear \u2026\u201d before he was interrupted by Schofield, who said: \u201cNo, just say sorry.\u201d Corbyn repeated again: \u201cCan I just make it clear \u2026 our party and me do not accept antisemitism in any form\u2026\u201d Schofield interrupted: \u201cSo are you sorry?\u201d Corbyn said: \u201cObviously I\u2019m very sorry for everything that\u2019s happened but I want to make this clear I am dealing with it. I have dealt with it. \u201cOther parties are also affected by antisemitism. Candidates have been withdrawn by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives and by us because we do not accept it in any form whatsoever.\u201d On the intervention of the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, in the election campaign, who said Corbyn was not fit to be prime minister, the Labour leader said that he has not been contacted directly about it but he would be happy to talk with him. He said: \u201cI think the chief rabbi\u2019s comments really ought to be taken for what they are. He hasn\u2019t contacted me. I\u2019m very happy to meet him. Very happy to talk to him.\u201d Asked if \u201csorry was the hardest word for him to say\u201d by presenter Holly Willoughby, he replied: \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Corbyn has previously apologised for the hurt caused to the Jewish community in a social media video released in the summer of 2018."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
