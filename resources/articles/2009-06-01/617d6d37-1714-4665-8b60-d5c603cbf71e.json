The shares were placed at 282p each by JP Morgan Cazenove. Laxey also sold its nil-paid rights for another \u00a318.4m, leaving it with no investment at all in Shaftesbury. It is believed Laxey was reluctant to commit more cash, and analysts believe it will use the funds to snap up smaller companies on Aim, more in line with its activist aims than a relatively stable property business. Overall, the market rose, helped by renewed signs of recovery in the US economy. Retail sales in America climbed 0.5% in May, though much of this was due to a rise in petrol prices, while the number of workers filing new benefit claims fell 24,000 to 601,000 last week, the lowest level since January. So the FTSE 100 closed 25.12 points higher at 4461.87. Banks were among the leading risers, with Barclays 16p better at 304.5p, ahead of the expected sale of its asset management business to US group Blackrock. The bank is also likely to be in the spotlight next week when it holds an investor presentation about its Barclays Capital division. Analyst Alex Potter at Collins Stewart issued a trading buy recommendation because of the prospect of positive news flow. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 1.8p to 39.7p while Lloyds Banking Group added 1.7p to 66.7p. There was little in the way of corporate news, although Home Retail Group, the Homebase and Argos owner, added 5p to 271p after better than expected first quarter figures. Premier Farnell, the electronic component distributor, closed 7p higher at 136p. First quarter profits fell 36% but the company said trading had improved in April and May compared to March. Elsewhere, engineering group Invensys rose 12.5p to 241.5p as Goldman Sachs moved its recommendation from neutral to buy. The continuing oil price rise left cruise operator Carnival 38p lower at \u00a315.19, while British Airways lost 2.6p to 143p. It was also hit by news that airport body ACI Europe was predicting an 8% fall in passenger numbers this year, against its previous forecast of a 5% decline. Sage slipped 0.2p to 186p as its Irish business gave free software to start-ups and small businesses. Panmure Gordon analyst George O'Connor advised clients to hold the shares, saying: \"Sage is (wisely) seeding the next generation of businesses, rather than cannibalising its current franchise.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
