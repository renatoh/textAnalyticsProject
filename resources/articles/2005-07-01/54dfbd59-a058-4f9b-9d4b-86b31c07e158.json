Investors piled into the sector - and hedge funds scrambled to buy back their short positions - after a leading broker predicted its recent rally, which started about a month ago, will continue. History shows that UK banking stocks tend to outperform the wider market in the second half of the year and Goldman Sachs believes 2005 will be no different. It sees solid interim results, robust loan growth and the likelihood of interest rate cuts as the drivers of further share price outperformance and believes domestically focused banks will deliver the best returns for investors. With that in mind Goldman yesterday upgraded ratings on HBOS and Northern Rock, which rose 16.5p to 891p and 10.5p to 823.5p respectively, and repeated its \"outperform\" recommendation on Royal Bank of Scotland, which advanced 21p to \u00a317.38. Those gains helped leading shares close higher. At the close of play, the FTSE 100 was showing a rise of 28.7 points at 5,245.9, taking the blue-chip index to within 10-points of Monday's three-year high. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 improved 4.5 points to 7,541.7, while the FTSE Small Cap index added 14 points to close at 2,981.1. Market turnover was poor, with around 2.7bn shares changing hands. As usual Vodafone, up 0.5p to 143p on the back of Goldman Sachs upgrade, was the most heavily traded stock. In the bond market, the 10-year gilt closed around 103.530, yielding 4.316%. Retail conglomerate GUS recorded one of the day's biggest blue-chip gains. Its shares rose 19.5p to 866p after its luxury goods spin-off Burberry Group (25.5p, or 6.2%, higher at 437.5p) posted better than expected first quarter figures. GUS owns 66% of Burberry but is planning to give the shares to investors later this year. Elsewhere, logistics group Exel, 18.5p higher at 907.5p, hit a three-year high as takeover speculation continued, while DIY retailer Kingfisher firmed 2p to 247.5p in heavy volume on talk of an approach from either Wolseley, 12p stronger at \u00a312.02, or a US rival. On the downside, defensive stocks - utilities and tobacco companies - were under pressure as investors decided to bank recent gains. Scottish Power faded 7.5p to 499.75p, while British American Tobacco slipped 14p to \u00a310.70 and Severn Trent lost 12p to 973p. ITV eased 1.25p to 125.5p despite some interesting activity on the futures and options market LIFFE, where buyers emerged for its 140p-call options. Away from the blue-chips, standout features were few and far between. IT company Morse gained 16.5p to 91p on news that full-year operating profits would top City expectations. Elsewhere, Urbium climbed 100p to 930p after the Tiger Tiger bar operator rejected a 975p-a-share cash and stock offer from Regent Inns, steady at 78.5p, and then revealed it had received \"serious expressions of interest\" from a number of interested parties and had asked Numis Securities to evaluate them. Still in the leisure sector, bar operator Ultimate Leisure fell 12.5p to 266.5p as traders reacted to a further share sales by chairman Allan Rankin. After the market closed on Tuesday, Mr Rankin, who knocked out 500,000 shares on Monday, declared the sale of a further 600,000. Northern Foods faded 1.75p to 157.75p despite news of improving food sales at one of its biggest customers - Marks &amp; Spencer, up 7.75p at 365.75p. Traders said the stock had been hit by investors selling in order to take up stock in next week's flotation of RHM. Traders reckon RHM has been priced to go and, at the bottom end of the indicative 228p-285p price range, will be significantly cheaper than Northern Foods. Elsewhere, talk of upbeat institutional presentations helped Bowleven, the African oil and gas explorer, improve 40p to 575p. Aegis, the media buying group, added 0.25p to 100.25p on talk that it could be a takeover target for Publicis. ITM Power, the fuel cell specialist, gained 3.5p to 98p after broker Panmure Gordon successfully found buyers for 6.8m shares held by three founders. The stock was placed with new and existing investors at 88p and non-executive director Peter Hargreaves, who purchased 244,000 shares. Lodore Resources, the oil and gas exploration company, firmed 0.25p to 14p as it provided shareholders with more details of an all-share offer from Japanese company IB Daiwa. Traders noted that Lodore's 35% shareholder, Crosby Capital, off 0.75p at 50p, recently took management control of IB Daiwa and has an option to buy 34% of the company. Goldshield, the generic drug distributor at the centre of a Serious Fraud Office investigation, rose 1p to 285.5p despite news that chief executive Ajit Patel had offloaded 400,000 shares, 1% of the firm, at 262.5p. Matalan leads retail stir The discount retailer Matalan provided one of the few talking points for City traders and speculators yesterday. By the close of business more than 16m Matalan shares had changed hands - several times the daily average - as various rumours did the rounds. First, there was talk of stake-building and then of a financial consortium plotting a leveraged bid. However, the fact that Matalan purchased 150,000 shares for cancellation yesterday suggests that if there is a bidder out there then it has not approached Matalan yet. Specialists also noted that the whole retail sector had been in demand yesterday as investors switched out of European retail stocks into their British counterparts. Matalan closed 5p higher at 190.25p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
