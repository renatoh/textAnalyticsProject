Kashechkin, who was suspended by Astana on Wednesday, failed a test on August 1 and became the Swiss team's second rider to be censured for drug use in less than a month following Alexandr Vinokourov's positive test for blood doping during the Tour de France. \"We have spoken with the team's directors and they have said they will take measures,\" the Tour of Spain director-general, V\u00edctor Cordero, said yesterday. \"We have agreed to analyse the situation and will take a decision on Monday on whether the team will be joining the race, which at the moment looks unlikely.\" Vinokourov, the Tour de France pre-race favourite, forced Astana to pull out of cycling's flagship event with his positive test and was subsequently sacked by the team despite denying any wrongdoing. Astana has since suspended its activities and were to resume training tomorrow in the Swiss Alps. The Tour of Spain organisers, Unipublic, had said last week they would allow Astana to enter the race in response to promises from the team that they would carry out a review of their operations. The drugs saga has not impacted on the immediate future of the T-Mobile team, who have retained their sponsor Deutsche Telekom despite one of their riders, Patrik Sinkewitz, testing positive for elevated levels of testosterone a training camp before the Tour de France. Christian Frommert, a spokesman for the telecommunications company, said yesterday it was committed to helping the sport earn back trust and had decided it would honour a contract with the team until 2010."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
