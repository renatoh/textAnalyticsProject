One moment, everything in the little Cornish fishing port was business as usual; the next, a huge torrent of water was powering down towards the sea, smashing everything in its path. Until then, 16 August 2004 had been a typical summer's day, albeit cloudier and wetter than visitors would have wished. The next day, the villagers counted the cost. Six buildings and 80 vehicles had been washed into the sea, more than 100 homes and businesses had been destroyed, and debris was everywhere. Some 150 people had had to be rescued by helicopter from roofs and trees, and yet, astonishingly, there were no deaths or serious injuries. Locals and visitors had a very lucky escape. Exactly 52 years earlier, on 16 August 1952, 34 people had been killed by a similar flash flood in the north Devon town of Lynmouth. The Boscastle flood was caused by a very particular set of weather conditions, combined with the local geography. The remnants of Hurricane Alex had sent a deep low pressure system across the Atlantic, bringing exceptionally heavy rain to Bodmin Moor. As the waters flowed down the narrow river valley into Boscastle they created a wall of water which destroyed everything in its path. The village remains vulnerable, history almost repeating itself in June 2007 when heavy rains blocked drains and threatened to flood Boscastle again. Fortunately this time the flood was contained within the banks of the river, and disaster did not strike again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
