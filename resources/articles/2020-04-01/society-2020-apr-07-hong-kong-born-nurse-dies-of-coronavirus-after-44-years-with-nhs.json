Alice Kit Tak Ong, who worked for the health service for 44 years, was described by her daughter Melissa as \u201ccompletely dedicated\u201d. Her family believe she may have contracted the virus while working without protective equipment in a doctor\u2019s surgery. Ong came to the UK aged 23 to study nursing and joined the health service as soon as she was able. At 70, she was still working full-time across two surgeries and running busy baby clinics until she became ill with coronavirus. At first she self-isolated at home, but when her breathing deteriorated her family called an ambulance and she was taken to hospital. On Tuesday morning, two weeks after she was admitted, she died peacefully in the care of doctors and nurses at the Royal Free hospital in London. Her daughter, Melissa Ong, 37, said her mother had spent her life helping and caring for others. \u201cShe was completely dedicated to her work, that\u2019s what she was doing until the moment she was taken ill,\u201d she said. \u201cShe loved her job and she loved her patients.\u201d After qualifying, Ong worked first as a midwife, then as a diabetic specialist nurse before working in the community for the last 20 years. Dr Amrit Lamba, a GP at the Colindale medical centre in Barnet, where Ong was the practice nurse, said they had shared a passion for the treatment of diabetes and \u201cKit\u201d, as she was known, had encouraged and supervised his own specialism in the area. \u201cShe had talked of retirement, but nursing and medicine was a real passion for her and she would never let it go,\u201d he said. \u201cEven at the end of her career, she was up-to-date on every development and sharing her wisdom with the practice. She\u2019ll be missed and remembered very, very fondly.\u201d Jacqui Tonge, practice manager at the Greenfield medical centre, where Ong also worked, said she was \u201cloyal, dependable, kind\u201d and always put others first. \u201cShe cared deeply about her patients and she was a great mentor and role model for junior nurses,\u201d said Tonge. \u201cShe was incredibly experienced and knowledgeable. We\u2019ve not just lost a work colleague, we\u2019ve lost a friend.\u201d Her family believe she may have contracted the virus while working in doctors\u2019 surgeries. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure when she contracted it, but she was working without protective equipment,\u201d said her daughter. But, she added: \u201cWe\u2019ve accepted it, she was doing what she loved.\u201d Ong\u2019s daughter and her husband, Marcus \u2013 whom she met in London and married in 1977 - were unable to go to hospital to visit her, because of her husband\u2019s age and underlying health conditions. But Melissa Ong praised the care her mother had received at the Royal Free. \u201cThe nurses and doctors were fantastic throughout. They kept us in touch right up to the last moment so she could hear us over the phone,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew she was in good hands, and they were with her in her last moments.\u201d Ong said the family had been inundated with messages of condolences and love. \u201cShe had a very good heart and very generous personality. Everybody loved her,\u201d she said. \u201cShe always believed in the good in people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
