The 25-year-old was in tears as he was named the winner and dedicated his award to all of the victims who died in the terrorist attacks in Paris last week. Struggling for words, Clementine told Lauren Laverne he \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe he had won\u201d and invited all his fellow nominees to join him on stage at BBC Broadcasting House. \u201cI never thought I would say this,\u201d he said in an emotional acceptance speech. \u201cIf anyone is watching, any child or youngster or student. The world is your oyster. Go out there and get what you want to get\u201d. London-born Clementine beat competition from bookies\u2019 favourites Jamie xx, as well as artists including Gaz Coombes, Florence and the Machine, Slaves and Aphex Twin. Clementine\u2019s debut album, At Least for Now, was released in March and was described by the Guardian as \u201cbold, brave, beautiful and at times quite brilliant.\u201d Speaking after the ceremony, Clementine said he was \u201csurprised, blown away, it\u2019s amazing\u201d. He recounted his extraordinary past, which involved him moving to Paris in 2010, age 19, with no money and nothing but a suitcase filled with uncooked spaghetti. After finding nowhere to stay, he ended up sleeping in doorways in Paris in the depths of winter. He began busking after six months living rough and spent the next three years sleeping in hostels across the city, before he was spotted by two French producers on the M\u00e9tro. \u201cI was homeless and busking,\u201d he said. \u201cI was living nowhere, I was living in the streets. I met a lot of people but couldn\u2019t speak the language so I had to just get on. \u201cI realised that we are all equal and that it\u2019s all about helping each other and I learned a lot of things from Paris. In Paris I learned to grow up as a man.\u201d He added: \u201cI am English but I do truly respect Paris, the people of Paris, they love art and I really did have to dedicate this to them. Clementine said the city remained \u201cvery dear\u201d to him and said that he had been \u201cdevastated, very sad, heartbroken\u201d following the news of terrorist attacks in the city last Friday. He said he had visited the Bataclan last Saturday to pay his respects to the victims. \u201cI went to the [Bataclan] for a little bit and then I felt free,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like a weight had been pulled off my shoulder.\u201d Clementine said he only started dreaming about becoming a professional musician three years into busking in Paris, after people on the streets started giving him encouragement and he began writing his own songs. He said couldn\u2019t believe he was receiving the same award that had been given to his musical hero Anthony Hergarty, of Anthony and the Johnsons, in 2000. \u201cI didn\u2019t ever think it would get here and I didn\u2019t have have anyone who could help get me here. In England, no-one had heard of me ... I always said, unless England accepts me I\u2019m going to be very, very sad. Well I guess they now accept me a bit too much.\u201d Clementine said he would be putting the \u00a320,000 Mercury prize money towards pianos in his home borough of Edmonton, as well as funding his tour. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought about helping homeless people, since I was once homeless, so if it can \u2013 because \u00a320,000 should someway, somehow help people \u2013 I\u2019ll put it that way.\u201d Singer Corinne Bailey-Rae, who was on the judging panel, said Clementine\u2019s record had won the judges over with its original songwriting, and \u201cfresh and contemporary sound\u201d. \u201cWe just thought this was really special and we thought he was an artist who was unique. Obviously vocally he has a very specific interesting sound, but also the things he is choosing to write about and the melodies and how they veer off in a really unexpected way; I was calling it fireworks. \u201cIt\u2019s really free and you feel like you are with him, in his mind, on that rollercoaster ride ... sometimes you feel like you are inside the piano.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
