The best track by our favourite new artist Matias Aguayo: I Don't Smoke He's maybe not that new but this track is a blinder. It's about an annoying raver mithering you for a snout whilst you're DJing. House music with fun and adventure. The track we always play to rescue a dancefloor Anything by Joris Voorn or Michel Cleis Their tracks are ruthlessly effective. We know we're in trouble if the other says, \"Draw for the Voorn and Cleis.\" The track we'd play at our auntie's wedding The Beatles: Got To Get You Into My Life It's like a Motown tune, all horns and stomping beat. Raf played it at his pal's wedding this summer, and it went off. The ideal festival track Kenny Dope Presents The Bucketheads: The Bomb The 14-minute version seems to work as well on a big crowd in 2011 as it ever did. We played it at Bestival, Creamfields and Glastonbury and it kicked off every time. The track we'd play to show off our eclectic tastes Kitty Wells: All The Time A country and western weeper par excellence. A shout out to East End Country Gent Liam Watson for introducing us to the ways of the weeper. The track that's been unfairly slept on this year Cajmere &amp; Gene Farris: Humming Bird An old-fashioned, loop-built disco nagger. Brilliant Chicago house. The track that got us out of bed this morning Top Cat: Over U Body A 90s dancehall tune that samples Jean Knight's soul classic, Mr Big Stuff. The track we wish we'd signed to our label Parrot: Untitled Parrot, a Sheffield legend who was in the All Seeing I, has made a bunch of blinding new house tracks. We were too slow off the mark and he signed them to Classic instead. You snooze, you lose. Gutted. The track that should have been a crossover hit Green Velvet ft Russoul: Millie Vanillie This is Green Velvet at his best: an anti-fakers anthem with a simple, banging beat. Maybe there's still time for it to cross over. The 2 Bears play Trilogy Part 2, Leeds University Union, Sat, waxonuk.com, and Motion, Bristol, Fri"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
