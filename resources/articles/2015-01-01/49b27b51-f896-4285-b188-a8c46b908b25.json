He\u2019s more of a lover than a fighter.\u201d Fight is precisely what Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s side require having dropped to within four points of the relegation zone following four successive defeats in the Premier League. The losing streak was halted by Romelu Lukaku\u2019s 91st-minute equaliser against West Ham United in the FA Cup on Tuesday but with the champions, Manchester City, up next, talk of turning-points has been restrained. Goodison Park will be tense, it has been fractious and the well-oiled Merseyside rumour mill has provided an invaluable release for Mart\u00ednez\u2019s players. \u201cYou do hear some weird stuff but it gives us a bit of a laugh at the training ground,\u201d Jagielka said. \u201cSometimes football isn\u2019t enough for stories so people go a few steps further but we appreciate the really funny stuff because it keeps us going on a day-to-day basis.\u201d Not that Everton\u2019s form or position is a cause for levity with the England international. Jagielka can laugh off claims of unrest in the dressing room, he can cite the disruption caused by injuries with justification (Mart\u00ednez is likely to field a fourth central-defensive partnership in four games on Saturday) but he bristles at the suggestion Everton\u2019s players are struggling to implement their manager\u2019s instructions. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a very similar bunch of players to last season, when these questions weren\u2019t being asked,\u201d said the 32-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult question to answer. We\u2019ve not had a consistent team selection \u2013 quite a few injuries \u2013 but I don\u2019t think you can aim that question at us. We were asked to play in a much different style last season to how we had played for quite a few years, and that criticism didn\u2019t come up then, when we were doing well. It is an easy, simple question to ask now.\u201d But Everton were pushing for a top-four finish last season, not languishing above the drop zone with what appears a stronger, more experienced squad. \u201cThat\u2019s true and the league speaks for itself,\u201d Jagielka said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think all of a sudden you can start questioning that no one knows what the manager wants or is doing. If it had been asked last season it would\u2019ve been a viable question.\u201d Everton\u2019s recent league performances have invited the question, however, and Lukaku\u2019s admission that players had asked Mart\u00ednez to go more direct in what was an improved display against West Ham provided more fuel. \u201cYou can have a conversation with the manager, he\u2019s not a closed book, but things can be taken out of context,\u201d explained Jagielka. \u201cWest Ham pressed us a lot which didn\u2019t allow us to play out from the back and meant a lot of goal kicks and free-kicks went up to Rom. It wasn\u2019t as if we were all waiting in a room for the manager, lined him up and threatened him. Many of us have conversations with the manager during the week and that was one of them.\u201d The captain accepted Everton \u201chave been conceding far too many goals and not scoring nearly enough\u201d but insisted that is a simplistic explanation for the team\u2019s underachievement. When confidence is low \u201cyou tend to second-guess yourself at times\u201d added Jagielka, who added: \u201cWe have put in a lot of decent 60 minute performances but football is 90 minutes long and we have not managed to see it through to the end.\u201d Several individuals have failed to recapture or build on last season\u2019s form including Ross Barkley, although the 21-year-old has not been helped by Mart\u00ednez\u2019s insistence on playing the central midfielder out wide. His fellow England international admitted: \u201cRoss is probably always going to be a frustrating player because he can do so much with a ball that everyone expects him to do something every time he gets it. He is being closely watched by the opposition now, they will know his strong points and his weak points. I\u2019m sure he is frustrated with his form but that doesn\u2019t mean he is playing badly, I\u2019m just sure he would like to score in every game and be a massive part. It is a difficult environment at the moment but this will make him a better player in the future.\u201d It is not Jagielka\u2019s style as captain to make Churchillian speeches before a game or lambast the group after a defeat. \u201cHow many times can you give a rallying cry?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow nervous do you want to make people? I do go around and speak to players individually or in little groups but I don\u2019t sit at home hoping to have to issue a rallying cry. If I felt it had come to make-or-break time I would, but we have not reached panic stations and hopefully we don\u2019t.\u201d Everton\u2019s captain is acutely aware that a club who opened the season aspiring to qualify for the Champions League are in danger of a relegation scrap. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say they set the alarm bells ringing but the Hull and the Southampton games brought it home to me,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is simple in this league. Those two away defeats give you a sense of realism that unless we start picking up points on Saturday it\u2019s going to be a tough second half of the season. But with the players we have we can deal with that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
