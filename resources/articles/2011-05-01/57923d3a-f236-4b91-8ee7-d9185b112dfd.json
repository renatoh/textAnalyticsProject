A regime that occurs to me is the one that occupies the monolithic and ever-expanding palace that now dominates the South Bank of the Thames as well as the entire British art establishment, and has done for 23 years. Despite having presided over numerous examples of conflicts of interest and accusations of cronyism in the appointment of trustees etc, you might be forgiven for thinking that Sir Nicholas Serota is de facto Tate president for life and that the contemporary art world is now moulded in his image. Ai Weiwei (Anish Kapoor calls for Ai Weiwei protest, 11 May) is indeed a rare beacon of dissidence in the contemporary art world and a shining example to those who would have no truck with despotism. I long for the day when a commissioned artist, out of sheer perverse bravado, might fill the lofty, intimidating Turbine Hall of Tate Modern with delicately crafted watercolours, possibly even hung on the wall.
