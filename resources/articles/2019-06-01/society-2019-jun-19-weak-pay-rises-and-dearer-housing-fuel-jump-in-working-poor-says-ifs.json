The Institute for Fiscal Studies found that a drop in the number of workless households, better-off pensioners and higher rents had resulted in 8 million in poverty from working households. The thinktank said that between 1994 and 2017 the share of poverty accounted for by working households had jumped from 37% to 58%. The in-work poor were living in relative poverty because they were living on less than 60% of median income. The IFS said the less well-off had been financially hit by more expensive housing and by weak earnings growth, but were still better off than they would have been had they been unemployed. It added that success in cutting the number of households with nobody in paid employment had been a key factor in increasing in-work poverty. In the mid-1990s, 18% of working-age households had no one in work but by 2017-18 that figure had dropped to 11%. \u201cOver the same period, the worklessness rate of lone-parent households fell from 66% to 36%. Because lone parents and other groups that have moved into work tend to have low earnings, earnings inequality and in-work poverty have increased, even though by moving into work, these households are themselves better off,\u201d the IFS said. Another development of the past quarter century \u2013 the rapid growth in pensioner income \u2013 had also been a factor in concentrating poverty in working households because the impact had been to push up both median income and the relative poverty line. That meant more working-age families fell below the poverty line and helped explain why there was an increase from 13% to 18% in the proportion of people in working households living in relative poverty. Excluding pensioners from the calculations, the increase in in-work poverty would be closer to 3 percentage points rather than 5 percentage points. Xiaowei Xu, a research economist at the IFS, and an author of the research, said: \u201cThe gradual rise in relative in-work poverty rates from 13% in the mid 1990s to 18% in 2017 are the result of complex trends. \u201cThe rise in pensioner incomes driven by state and private pensions has pushed up the relative poverty line. Higher employment rates of people who are likely to have low earnings \u2013 such as lone parents \u2013 are a positive trend, even though this pushes up in-work poverty figures. However, higher inequality in earnings for working households, and considerably higher growth in housing costs for poor households have been key reasons for higher in-work poverty.\u201d The IFS said that it could find little evidence of an increase in severe poverty \u2013 the proportion with very low incomes and spending \u2013 during the period since the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition came to power in 2010."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
