As she proved when she played Hamlet at the Royal Exchange, Peake has a built-in bullshit detector whereas Blanche\u2019s tragedy is that she lives in a cloud of self-deception. But Peake is an actor of such shape-shifting skill that she fully persuades you she is Williams\u2019s disintegrating southern belle in Sarah Frankcom\u2019s fine production. It helps that Frankcom suggests Blanche is trapped in a living nightmare. On her arrival in New Orleans on her doomed visit to the Kowalskis \u2013 sister Stella and her husband, Stanley \u2013 Blanche is caught in the midst of a frightening swirl of activity. Peter Rice\u2019s sound design constantly fills the air with throbs, hums and the clang of distant streetcars, while Jack Knowles\u2019s lighting is full of sudden vibrating colour shifts. It is also typical of a phantasmagoric evening that Blanche is shadowed by not one but three figures all bedecked in death-haunted roses. It is, however, very much Peake\u2019s evening and she catches perfectly Blanche\u2019s reflex, desperate flirtatiousness. Peake buffs her nails and oils her skin before confronting her predatory Polish brother-in-law, skips girlishly and coyly in front of Mitch, the one man prepared to take her seriously, and puts on the airs and graces of a displaced southern aristo. She even feigns prudishness when her sister, Stella, freely boasts of Stanley\u2019s sexual prowess. But the key to Peake\u2019s performance lies in the way she captures Blanche\u2019s limitless capacity for self-delusion. Offered a drink, she says \u201cone\u2019s my limit\u201d while avidly clasping the neck of the bottle. In one of the most ironic moments in American drama, she lectures Stella and tells her, in the manner of a southern schoolmarm \u201cto pull yourself together and face facts\u201d. That is the one thing Blanche can never do, and Peake superbly gives us the tragic spectacle of a woman who disintegrates into panic and hysteria as the net slowly closes around her and the truth of her condition becomes inescapable. It is a breathtaking Blanche that follows a succession of fine interpretations by Glenn Close, Rachel Weisz and Gillian Anderson. My only query about the production is that it is so much on Blanche\u2019s side that some of the play\u2019s ambiguity is sacrificed. In Ben Batt\u2019s very good performance, Stanley represents all that is ugly, cruel and unforgiving in a male-dominated culture: he not only behaves violently to Stella but rapes Blanche by brutally thrusting her against a glass partition. All that is in the play; but so too is Williams\u2019s emphasis on Blanche\u2019s snobbish condescension to Stanley and the character\u2019s instinctive earthy vitality. Even if the dice are here loaded against Stanley, there is a very good performance by Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Stella which conveys her willing surrender to her husband\u2019s ferocious sexual energy. Youssef Kerkour also conveys the stumbling, tongue-tied decency of Mitch, who finds an echo of his own loneliness in Blanche, and Michelle Butterly is striking as the upstairs neighbour well used to the Kowalskis\u2019 rough-house antics. In the end, what moves one about the play is Williams\u2019s portrait of naked desperation. And what most of us will remember from this production is Peake\u2019s Blanche for its portrayal of the character\u2019s vanity, vulnerability and desperate, immovable solitude. At the Royal Exchange, Manchester, until 15 October. Box office: 0161-833 9833."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
