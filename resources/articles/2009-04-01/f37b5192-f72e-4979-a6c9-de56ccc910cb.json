But increasingly coaches and players are calling for a change. For most players tomorrow's game will be their third match in nine days as Super League squads are stretched to breaking point. Expect some high scoring matches as players struggle to compete for 80 minutes in a contest which becomes more a test of endurance than skill. League is arguably the toughest team sport in the world and everyone agrees that one game per week is all a player's body can reasonably stand. Coaches will tell you that when they don't get the full seven-day break between matches it affects their preparation of the team so around Easter it's often just a case of scraping together a team to put out on the pitch. Players, like the England captain Jamie Peacock, have called for just one round of matches to be played over Easter and Paul Wellens, the St Helens and England full back, agrees. \"The congested Easter period is something I've dealt with throughout my career and I've learned to deal with it,\" Wellens said. \"You just have to get on with it, but if I had the choice I'd rather not play as many games over this period. \"With the salary cap, squads are probably smaller and it puts more pressure on players to perform. Certainly on Easter Monday there will be a lot of players taking the field carrying injuries. \"My experience of Easter Monday games is of high scoring affairs where players are jaded and struggle to compete with the intensity for 80 minutes.\" Wellens also believes that the busy Easter programme can have a long-lasting effect on teams. \"My experience of the Easter period is that that's when the Super League table starts to take shape and there's the effect this period can have on the weeks following. It's not as if you can have a couple of weeks off after the Easter period, you just go back into the regular weekly rounds. It is a concern for players when you play so many games. I'm sure something could be done to ease the congestion over Easter.\" However that may not be as easy as it sounds. Gary Hetherington, chief executive of the Leeds Rhinos, realises that the Easter period can be very demanding on the players but says there is no easy solution. \"When people make suggestions unfortunately they never back it up by a suggestion as to what we should do as an alternative,\" says Hetherington. \"I think everyone agrees that we're probably starting the season earlier than we'd like to. The only alternative would be to start even earlier, which wouldn't be ideal. We can't finish any later due to international commitments. \"There's no doubt it's very demanding on the players but on the other hand, traditionally we get really good crowds over that period. Nobody's yet come up with a sensible suggestion as what to do instead. \"It's very popular with the fans and we are in the entertainment business. If you look at the attendances, historically the Easter weekend is a bit of a bonanza time for the game. \"Interestingly, rugby union's Premiership are deciding to go to three games over the Christmas period. They're definitely going to be playing more than one game a week over that period for exactly the same reasons - there's a demand from the public. There's no perfect solution, the alternative is probably much more problematic.\" So enjoy the games, but if your team struggles tomorrow afternoon, then don't be too hard on the weary players."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
