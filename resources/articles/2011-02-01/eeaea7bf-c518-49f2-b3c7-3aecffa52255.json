Summerbee admitted losing his temper after City's 2-1 defeat in the Manchester derby last weekend but said he stuck by his words and remains angry about the way \"they only see United\". To illustrate his point, the man who formed part of the most successful side in City's history condemned Sky for the frequency with which it has repeated Wayne Rooney's winning goal. \"I am already fed up with seeing and reading about that Rooney goal,\" Summerbee wrote in his column in the matchday programme. \"It was special \u2013 any football fan would admit that \u2013 but you can have too much of it. The day after the derby I came back from watching my grandson score two goals in his Sunday morning match, switched on the telly and there was that goal again. I gave it the quick change to Antiques Roadshow.\" Senior sources at Sky have indicated that Summerbee, now a club ambassador, will not be invited on again but the 68-year-old said he had been heartened by the comments from City supporters. \"Most of them have been extremely positive,\" he said. \"I did lose my temper a little bit and it is a good job for Dwight Yorke [the former Manchester United player was a fellow pundit] that I have mellowed with age. \"They [the media] go on as though we don't exist and that annoys me. I don't mind banter. I don't even mind jokes at our expense but, when I feel the progress we have clearly made \u2013 on and off the field \u2013 is being ignored, then it gets my goat. \"I was proud of the way we knocked the ball around at Old Trafford. We played some lovely football and on another day could have got at least a point out of the game. For the first time in a long time I left Old Trafford after a defeat not depressed about the result. One of the biggest compliments was the fact Sir Alex Ferguson left his top scorer [Dimitar Berbatov] on the bench. He knew what a danger we posed. \"There will be many City fans who will be sick of hearing that United are looking over their shoulder and that we are closing the gap on them but I genuinely believe that the Reds are not hearing us coming up behind them but looking at us right alongside now.\" City's lawyers are taking action to remove a spoof account, Simple_as_Mike, that has appeared on Twitter, with the profile 'Embittered Manchester City legend and enemy of statistics &amp; facts.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
