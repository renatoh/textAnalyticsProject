Julie Ward, who lived near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was killed while photographing wildlife in the Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya in September 1988. She was 28 when she died. No one has been convicted of her murder and her 70-year-old father, John, says the Kenyan government and police staged a cover-up to protect the reputation of the country's tourist industry. He has complained that the Metropolitan police, who travelled to Kenya to investigate the killing, and the Foreign Office colluded in the cover-up. At the inquest into his daughter's death, Mr Ward today questioned retired detective chief superintendent Ken Thompson, who spent four days in Kenya looking into the case in January 1990. Mr Ward asked Mr Thompson about a report he had written following his visit. \"You appear to have glossed over or ignored controversial issues. You must have had a pretty good knowledge that things were not too straight in Kenya at that time,\" Mr Ward said. \"I am amazed you only went for four days, \" he added. \"Certainly my role was not to criticise the Kenyan government or the Kenyan police. My role was to ascertain whether we could assist them,\" Mr Thompson told Ipswich coroner Peter Dean. \"I have phrased one or two points to avoid the accusation I was being critical of the investigation. There are one or two things there that I have phrased diplomatically and quite frankly you have got to do that,\" he said. At the beginning of his evidence yesterday, Mr Thompson told the inquest: \"I have got nothing to hide.\" Dr Dean said two former senior Met detectives who had also been involved in investigating Ms Ward's death would not be giving evidence at the inquest. He said former detective superintendent Graham Searle and former detective inspector David Shiperlee had been invited to attend the hearing but had not accepted the invitation. Dr Dean said he had not felt it appropriate to force anyone to attend the hearing because it was not an adversarial trial and was not designed to analyse the performance of the police. \"I am not prepared to allow this hearing to become a trial of the performance of individual officers. The inquiry into the performance of officers may be a matter for the police complaints authority,\" he said. Lincolnshire police are investigating the Julie Ward inquiry following a complaint by Mr Ward about the way it was handled. Their report is due to be published later this year, and it is expected that they will speak to all officers involved in the investigation over the past 16 years. Dr Dean has already heard from Egyptian pathologist Adel Shaker, who examined Ms Ward's remains. He said in a written statement that he had been intimidated into doctoring his report to suggest she was savaged by wild animals rather than murdered. The hearing continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
