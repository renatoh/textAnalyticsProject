The bank, renowned for its quirky advertising, also insisted it was on track to break even in the last quarter of the year after reporting a narrower loss in the first half of 2001. Still 80% owned by the insurance company Prudential, Egg reported a 21% fall in losses to \u00a363m in the six months to June 30, a little better than the City had expected. Paul Gratton, the chief executive, said Egg attracted more customers in the first half of the year - 370,000 - than in any comparable period since its high-profile launch in 1998. \"We're seeing faster growth than ever. Customers are coming from high street banks which are still charging high rates of interest. Customers are getting more aware of what their banks are charging.\" Egg's first product was a market-beating savings account. It now offers products such as a credit card and a funds supermarket. It also has ventures with the Boots chemists chain and last week joined forces with Microsoft. Egg wants to clinch similar deals across Europe and is rumoured to be close to agreement with a French retailer to offer its credit cards in-store. Mr Gratton declined to discuss the specifics of any negotiations but said he was setting his sights high. \"We remain committed to doing a deal with the right European partners. I happen to believe Egg can do a deal with what in Hollywood would be the A-list celebrities.\" To become profitable and sustain that state, Egg needs to sell the equivalent of 1.5 products to each of its customers. In the first half it edged closed to this target, hitting a \"cross-sell figure\" of 1.36, up from 1.09, on its 1.7m customer base. Nick Watkins, bank analyst at Merrill Lynch, believes that Egg's credit card operation is critical. \"The profitability and value are driven predominantly by the credit card business. Their competitive edge is on their ability to attract a better quality of customer.\" Mr Watkins has a price target of 200p on the shares, which yesterday closed at 164.75p. They floated at 160p last year. The City is not united in its support for Egg. Analysts at Fox-Pitt Kelton, for instance, have a target price for the shares of 85p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
