Here, he mixes sparkily swinging originals with Jackie McLean, Count Basie and Tchaikovsky imports, but he's chosen anything but a cosily mainstream band in hiring one of the budding creative stars of the UK scene in saxist Shabaka Hutchings. Jon Gee and Gene Calderazzo on piano and drums aren't conservative options either. The title track is a coolly grooving mid-tempo vehicle for Phelps's plummy tone and casually applied ornamentation, with the remarkable Hutchings offering a quirky blend of Lester Young's plaintive sound and a contemporary edginess. Scat-singer Michael Mwenso deftly trades phrases with Phelps on Jackie McLean's Out of the Blue, and the singer knowingly (and only slightly cheesily) chuckles his way through the swinger I Love My Mama. But there are plenty of non-mainstream diversions, like the Afrobeat sound to the trumpet and bass clarinet conversation on Phelps's Six Degrees of Separation, and the long, Coltranesque 10 Years, in which Hutchings unfurls his melodic originality \u2013 even if the leader sounds marginally less melodically secure here than he does on the straighter material. But it's an impressive, and shrewdly weighted debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
