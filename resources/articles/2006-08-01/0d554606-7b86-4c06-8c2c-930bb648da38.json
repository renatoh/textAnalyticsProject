The Publishers Weekly describes this theory, proffered by Andrew Dalby in Rediscovering Homer: Inside the Origins of the Epic, as \"audacious\", which perhaps it is; but less audacious, I think, than a similar theory about The Odyssey advanced by Samuel Butler, the author of Erewhon and The Way of All Flesh, in 1897 - a time when people were far more easily affronted by irreverence. (And the notion wasn't entirely original even then.) With Butler, of course, shocking the bourgeois (of which class he was indelibly a member) was one of the loveliest pleasures in life; and one cannot be sure how far his writing was inspired by rigorous scholarship and how far by the chance of sniping at imposing figures such as Gladstone, who, in Butler's view, liked to use these works as the basis for excessive pontification. \"I am the enfant terrible of literature and science,\" he boasts to himself in his Notebooks. \"If I cannot, and I know I cannot, get them to give me a shilling, I can, and I know I can, heave bricks into the middle of them.\" For maximum provocation, he gave this particular brick the aggressive title of The Authoress of the Odyssey; added the suggestion that the writer had smuggled herself into the story in the person of Nausicaa, daughter of Alcinous, king of the Phaeacians; and heaved it with all his might, in the hope that the great and good, hearing the shatter of glass, would fall down in fits of the vapours. Yet enlightened opinion already went part of the way with his argument. The view had developed that the works of Homer were not the product of a single great poet, but some kind of collection of stories passed down by oral tradition and rounded up by a collection of scholars into the works we know now. Butler believed that the world described in The Odyssey was far more circumscribed than conventional wisdom assumed, and that the scene of the action went hardly wider than Sicily - a contention he sought to shore up by taking what he liked to call his \"detective camera\" and photographing appropriate Sicilian locations. Attributing the work to a woman was part of this scaling down. He was not averse to women, but he had a misogynistic streak; it was 15 years before he let his mistress into the secret of who he was. This minimalist view did not mean he disparaged the book. He published his own translation, of a racier, more readable nature than those then in circulation. \"If a person would understand either The Odyssey or any other ancient work,\" he wrote in his Notebooks, \"he must never look at the dead without seeing the living in them, nor at the living without thinking of the dead. We are too fond of seeing the ancients as one thing and the moderns as the other.\" Butler profited little from his writings; only Erewhon made any money. Today, to judge from the Notebooks, he would have probably made a fortune, perhaps as a house vituperationist for the Daily Mail, or as a telly pundit. He delighted in snappy inversions of popular tenets - \"An honest God's the noblest work of man\" - and overheard oddities - \"At a funeral, the undertaker came up to a man and said to him: 'If you please, sir, the corpse's brother would be happy to take a glass of sherry with you'.\" He could not stand Oxford, or Plato, or Burne-Jones or Darwin (with whom he quarrelled about evolution). He thought Leonardo preposterously overadmired. Wordsworth he hated, and Tennyson even more. Yet whatever his streak of mischief, he meant to be taken seriously; and towards the end of his life he rated the thesis of The Authoress alongside Erewhon and \"the complete exposure and discomfiture of Charles Darwin and [Alfred Russel] Wallace\", which he dreamed he had achieved by three of his books, as among his greatest achievements. To those, I would add his great hymn of outrage on discovering that the Discobolus of Myron of Eleutherae was being kept in a Montreal museum basement for fear that its genitalia might offend (\"O God! O Montreal!\" he moans at the end of each verse); also, as I hope is already clear, his Notebooks, which run in full to thousands of pages, but which Jonathan Cape published long ago in a neat selected edition by Geoffrey Keynes and Brian Hill. Meanwhile, I'm delighted to see that The Authoress of the Odyssey has recently been brought back into print by a resurrectionist publisher, Bristol Phoenix Books.
