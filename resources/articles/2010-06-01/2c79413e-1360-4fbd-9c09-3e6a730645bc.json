Rooney was cautioned by a local referee, Jeff Selogilwe, during Monday's final warm-up game against Platinum Stars in Moruleng after his frustration allegedly prompted him to shout \"fuck you\" at the official. Selogilwe later warned that similar language could result in the striker being dismissed in the finals proper. \"We have to learn what kinds of words the players say,\" Hausmann said. \"All players swear, and we know we will hear a few 'son of a\u2026'\". Braatz added: \"We can't do this in 11 different languages, but at least we have to know the swear words in English.\" Should events in Saturday's game appear to be going against them, however, then England's players could, of course, merely resort to emulating the Palmeiras president, Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo, who last November denounced Simon as \"a crook, a scoundrel and a shameless bastard\" after his side's controversial 1-0 defeat to Fluminense."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
