Holyrood's legislative programme also includes the introduction of proportionate representation (PR) for local elections - the Liberal Democrats' price in becoming Labour's junior coalition partner. Mr McConnell told the Scottish parliament: \"We want to build a Scotland that delivers social justice and creates opportunities for all of its citizens to live and prosper. A country whose institutions are open and accountable and reflect the people's priorities.\" During April's election campaign, Labour ran on a platform of tackling anti-social behaviour. It now hopes to live up to its promises by allowing the courts to impose parenting orders and anti-social behaviour orders and tagging sentences on under-16s. The executive is also set to introduce bills to reform the NHS, to give ministers the power to intervene in failing schools and to protect vulnerable witnesses in court. The plans were agreed by the Scottish cabinet this morning, but come out of days of negotiations between Labour - who emerged the largest party in last month's elections - and the Liberal Democrats, who allow them to command a majority in the parliament. The Liberal Democrats' price for the coalition, the local governance bill, includes proposals to introduce the single transferable vote (STV) for local elections and lower the age for standing as a councillor from 21 to 18. This is expected to massively change the political make-up of Scotland's local authorities. Advocating the bill, which many Labour politicians are known to oppose, Mr McConnell championed it as a means to \"increase democratic participation\". \"A forward-looking, successful country needs a democratic framework that works well for its people,\" he added. The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, deputy first minister Jim Wallace, was perhaps a little more fulsome in his praise of the new electoral system. \"Our commitment to renew local democracy is also significant,\" he said. \"Introducing PR STV for local elections will make every vote count and ensure local councils properly represent the people who elect them.\" The Scottish National party's (SNP) leader, John Swinney, suggested a number of the executive's proposals were pitched from his manifesto, welcoming measures to safeguard Gaelic as a language, abolish NHS trusts and establish a strategic transport authority. \"We are glad that the partnership has taken some good ideas from this side of the chamber,\" he said. David McLetchie, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said he was concerned about the weight of legislation. \"It looks as though once again quality will be sacrificed for quantity,\" he suggested. He asked: \"When will the first minister realise that it isn't the quantity or length of the bills passed in this parliament which will restore public confidence in it but sensible measures which actually improve the quality of life for people in Scotland?\" Tommy Sheridan, leader of the six-strong Scottish Socialist group of MSPs, called for more measures to tackle poverty, including the abolition of council tax. \"If you are really concerned about creating a Scotland to be proud of don't you think it should be a Scotland that is more equal and more fair?\" he asked Mr McConnell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
