Max Mosley, the FIA president, intends to introduce measures to allow smaller teams to compete more effectively against front-runners such as Ferrari, McLaren-Mercedes and BMW Williams who each spend about \u00a3100m a year to retain their dominance. Unless the competing teams agree to a compromise deal embracing at least some of Mosley's requirements, new regulations will be forced through to impose the changes. The shake-up comes against a backcloth of tension caused by the recent bankruptcy of the Prost team and the belief of the major teams that they are being asked to make concessions to bail out inefficient teams. The teams spent many hours in meetings over the Malaysian grand prix weekend seeking a compromise based around the FIA's idea of limiting cars to one engine per race weekend from the start of 2003. This would effectively eliminate special qualifying engines and could see the likes of Michael Schumacher start from the back of the grid if their power units fail in qualifying. This would prevent teams from using costly special engines that offer extra power in the battle for starting grid positions but are then replaced with more moderately powered units for the race. Engine manufacturers are in favour of a phased reduction on the number of engines over the next three seasons, gradually working down to the FIA's target by 2005. Also proposed are further restrictions on testing and an obligation on engine suppliers to supply up to two teams if so required, enabling smaller teams to be more competitive. \"There are some teams who look for a performance advantage and some who look for a commercial advantage,\" said Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman. \"It may seem difficult to take when some team principals with private jets and big yachts come pleading poverty. Sometimes it does not seem fair.\" However, an FIA insider said: \"There is no doubt that we must take some steps to control costs, otherwise we believe there is a real prospect of a couple of other teams going to the wall just like Prost did a couple of months ago.\" David Richards, the chairman of British American Racing, agreed. \"We are involved in an extravagant, high-profile sport in a world where car manufacturers have been forced to make draconian employment cuts in order to balance their books at a time when formula one simply throws away expensive qualifying engines after just a handful of laps,\" he said. Away from the political battles Richards is preparing to tackle specific problems in his own team which he has headed since December when he was brought in to replace its founder Craig Pollock. On Sunday Jacques Villeneuve finished eighth, one lap down on Ralf Schumacher's winning Williams. Olivier Panis retired with transmission trouble. \"I think I have to say that Jacques Villeneuve drove our car as fast as it is going to go in Malaysia at the weekend,\" said Richards. \"If that's the best our design team can do, then we will have to make fundamental changes. They've had enough resources and money over a long enough period certainly to be in a better position than we are today.\" A major reshuffle of technical staff is expected. Richards has promised that BAR will start to turn the corner before the end of the current season. It is expected that Jaguar will be forced into a similarly dramatic reorganisation after another dismal experience for their drivers Eddie Irvine and Pedro de la Rosa, who trailed round at the back of the field at Sepang in Sunday's race. The team are testing this week at Barcelona and it is almost certain that the new Jaguar R3 will be ditched in favour of last season's R2B. Backtracking to last year's car may have served Ferrari well but for Jaguar it will, at best, be a damage-limitation exercise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
