Censor David Shanks said the findings were important because, increasingly, young people were using the internet as their first and primary tool to learn about sex \u2013 and many applied what they had seen to their own sex lives. And while adults usually had the experience to treat porn for what it was \u2013 fantasy \u2013 younger viewers did not. He said: \u201cFor young people, or people inclined to coercion, the repeated theme of \u2018no\u2019 becoming \u2018yes\u2019 could very easily be problematic.\u201d \u201cOften the videos with this content would start with a reluctant partner, usually the female, who starts out saying \u2018no\u2019 to sex but whose initial resistance is overcome through insistence and subtle pressure by the male. The actress is then portrayed as enjoying the sexual contact \u2013 female pleasure was notable in 99% of the videos,\u201d Shanks said. Women\u2019s groups in New Zealand say that extreme sexual acts are increasingly being viewed as normal by young people, mostly due to their popularity and prevalence in pornography. The New Zealand government is making moves to tighten access to pornography online, with a bill to be introduced to parliament next year. Internal affairs minister Tracey Martin has previously said it was a \u201cpriority\u201d for the government to limit children\u2019s and young people\u2019s access to harmful content online. Thursday\u2019s report was compiled by the chief censor\u2019s office, a government department, which analysed the 200 most popular clips viewed on Pornhub in the past year. It also found that 10% of the clips depicted scenes featuring physical aggression, and 9% contained the use of derogatory language. Shanks said: \u201cWhile many would observe that this is 10% too much, and I agree, this level is much lower than that indicated in various international studies.\u201d Shanks also described as \u201chighly problematic\u201d the fact that nearly half of the clips featured activity between step families, often involving depictions of a power imbalance and non-consensual activity. \u201cIn these scenarios, initial refusal or reluctance by one partner would often be shown as being overcome by persistence and pressure by the other,\u201d he said. Affectionate acts between partners was present in only about a quarter of the clips studied, and only 3% featured the use of a condom. \u201cIt is clear from this latest work that porn provides a very poor model for young people who are developing their understanding of consent and of what a healthy sexual relationship looks like,\u201d Shanks said. \u201cThey need a real counterpoint to the fictional and confusing stories that porn offers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
