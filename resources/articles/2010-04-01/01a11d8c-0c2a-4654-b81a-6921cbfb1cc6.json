The first is to go for gimmickry \u2013 to ring the changes with a plethora of sex weeks and other wacky commissions. The other is to go downmarket, and follow BBC2 into a morass of gardening and cookery programmes. It is to the eternal credit of Mark Damazer \u2013 who announced yesterday that he would step down as controller of Radio 4 in September \u2013 that he took neither perilous path. Perhaps the thought did not detain him long: Mr Damazer is after all the sort of man even clever colleagues describe as a \"bulging brain\", and has been known to spin out press interviews to diary-shredding lengths just so he can rhapsodise about his favourite historians (he read history at Cambridge and took a double starred first). Instead, over six years at the helm of Radio 4, he has livened up the station \u2013 but ever so gently. He has brought in fresh presenters (Evan Davis to Today, Jane Garvey on Woman's Hour, Kirsty Young on Desert Island Discs) and nifty new programmes (Americana, A History of the World in 100 Objects) \u2013 and informed the schedules with his current-affairs experience. There are some areas in which he could have gone further \u2013 Radio 4's presentation is an all-white enclave, and Quote ... Unquote should surely have been put down by now \u2013 but Mr Damazer has otherwise been an ambitious yet self-effacing channel controller \u2013 the sort of bureaucrat who gives the BBC a good name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
