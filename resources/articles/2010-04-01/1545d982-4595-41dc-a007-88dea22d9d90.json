The opening of all UK airports came after aircraft and engine manufacturers changed their advice on commercial jets' ability to withstand contamination from volcanic ash clouds that have grounded carriers across Europe and cost airlines $1.2bn (\u00a3780m) following the eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano. The first BA flights landed at Heathrow shortly before 10pm last night as Walsh said he believed the ban had been an over-the-top response. \"I personally believe we could have [used British airspace earlier]. I don't believe it was necessary to impose a blanket ban on UK airspace,\" he said. However, airports warned that the new regime imposed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) could cause delays for several days, as airlines will be required to run ash-damage checks before and after flights, while hundreds of planes and thousands of crew members are out of position around the world. Downing Street said: \"This solution has been reached as a result of the close working between the government, the CAA, airlines and the manufacturers, and will allow the thousands of UK citizens stranded abroad to return home to their families. The government will continue to work with all the relevant agencies to ensure that people can return to the UK quickly and safely, and that those booked on flights out of the UK can travel as soon as possible.\" Preparations to repatriate the stranded Britons were under way last night, as BA, easyJet and BMI said they planned to reinstate as many services as possible this morning. BA said \"hundreds of thousands\" of its passengers were still abroad. A spokesman for BAA, the owner of Heathrow airport, said: \"You cannot just close an airport for six days and then reopen without some hitches. It is an enormous logistical operation on the part of airlines and airports.\" BA said it would take \"considerable time\" to reinstate its full schedule, with around a third of its fleet and a quarter of its crew out of position. Nonetheless, it hopes to operate all long-haul flights from Heathrow and Gatwick today, along with a large number of short-haul cancellations. EasyJet said it would reinstate some flights but it suspended online check-in and warned that flights will close one hour before departure. Ryanair, Europe's largest short-haul carrier, was last night standing by plans to cancel north European flights until midday tomorrow and said it would not reimburse passengers' hotel and food costs \u2013 in contravention of EU guidelines. Airlines were allowed to reinstate flights after the CAA established new guidelines allowing aircraft to fly through low-density ash clouds. Under the new regime, swaths of UK airspace that were no-go areas 24 hours ago have been designated as safe for passenger flights. Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, said: \"Safety remains my paramount concern. Since the restrictions were imposed, the CAA have been working round the clock with the aircraft manufacturing industry, the airlines and the research community to better understand how different concentrations of ash affect aircraft engines. As a result, the CAA has now established a wider area in which it is safe to fly.\" The lifting of the flight embargo followed lobbying from the aviation industry, which has accused governments across Europe of overreacting. Adonis said the decision was not taken in response to BA's pressure but due to a change of advice from aircraft and engine manufacturers. The government denied it was a blow to its handling of the crisis and said it had relied on advice from the CAA and Nats, the national air traffic controller. Nats spokesman Alex Bristol said the only pressure the company had been under was to understand the nature of the volcanic ash cloud. He said that information about how aero engines could cope with adverse ash conditions only became available yesterday. Earlier, however, scientists and pilots had warned against the premature resumption of flights. Martin Chalk, a professional pilot and president of the European Cockpit Association, which represents 40,000 pilots across Europe, said: \"I don't think there is a definitive answer to whether it is safe or not.\" Theresa Villiers, the Conservative shadow transport secretary, said: \"This is welcome news and will come as huge relief for many, but we must not forget the hundreds of thousands stranded abroad. The government must still prove it has a clear and properly thought through rescue plan to deal with the massive backlog.\" Airlines had also expressed their frustration at the closure of airspace in southern England yesterday, which closed Britain's biggest airports for the sixth day, while flight corridors opened in Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and France. Just under half the continent's planned 27,500 flights went ahead. Last night Nats said air traffic control services had still not resumed over an area of north-west Scotland because of a \"dense concentration of volcanic ash\" and warned that the situation remained \"dynamic\" as a result of changing weather conditions. \"This brings to an end a period of disruption and uncertainty for air passengers,\" said a spokesman. \"Our operation is fully staffed and already responding to the backlog of flights entering UK airspace. We will be working with the airlines and airports to resume normal operations as soon as possible. \"Due to the scale of the disruption, it will take some time for flights to resume normal operations, and passengers are advised to check with their airlines for the latest information about flights.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
