The steely-eyed Kiwi skipper of BMW Oracle Racing was displaced from the boat before yesterday's sixth semi-final race in the Louis Vuitton Cup, where defeat to Luna Rossa ended their hopes of making the final. As skipper and chief executive of a \u00a3100m outfit, Dickson has been over-stretched for the past two years and both angles have suffered. According to crew members, he was infinitely more irritable as the team that was touted as favourite to win, foundered in competition. The official team statement said Sten Mohr would replace Dickson behind the wheel while Gavin Brady would add the skipper's duties to that of tactician. In it, Dickson reputedly added: \"In my capacity as CEO I fully support any moves that will give us a chance to win\", but dockside scuttlebutt suggests he is so far out of favour with the owner, Larry Ellison, that he no longer holds the CEO position. Throughout the series the BMW Oracle mainsail was inefficiently set upwind and fingers have pointed to the absence of rigging at the head of the mast - a Dickson modification that appears to have failed. The race between BMW Oracle and Luna Rossa was anticlimactic; with James Spithill in Luna Rossa dictating proceedings, forcing Mohr to the other end of the line. They rounded the first mark with a 32-second lead, an advantage they comfortably maintained to seal a 5-1 victory which ensured their place in the final. The other match saw an upset as the local \"weekend warriors\", Desaf\u00edo Espa\u00f1ol, scored a 15-second win over Emirates Team New Zealand to reduce their deficit to 4-2 and force at least one more race."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
