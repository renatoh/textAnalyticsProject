Dr Lucy Thomas, who was engaged to marry David Traill, the pilot, said there was clear evidence about the helicopter\u2019s record of faults and errors in its maintenance manuals that meant Traill was not to blame. After the fatal accident inquiry (FAI), Traill was blamed by the sheriff principal Craig Turnbull for failing to transfer more fuel into its supply tanks after fuel warning lights came on in the Eurocopter EC135. He said Traill \u201cconsciously took a risk. [That] decision had fatal consequences\u201d. The helicopter, which was carrying two police officers, crash-landed on the roof of the Clutha bar in Glasgow at 10.20pm on Friday 29 November 2013, before falling through the roof, killing its occupants and seven customers in the bar. Thomas, from Lochwinnoch in Renfrewshire, said Turnbull was wrong. She said the sheriff had failed to take proper account of the helicopter\u2019s history of faults with its caution advisory display, of \u201cerroneous or spurious fuel indications\u201d and problems such as fuel tank contamination. \u201cI find it distressing and incomprehensible that given months, not moments, to consider the facts, the sheriff principal has come to this conclusion,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, the sheriff principal has opted to sully the distinguished reputation of a pilot with an exemplary record who was renowned for his sense of responsibility and his regard for the safety of his crew.\u201d Traill\u2019s decision to keep flying despite seeing the fuel warning flights was a key issue for the inquiry. Turnbull ruled the pilot should have had ample fuel for the journey back to base, and should have followed the warning lights by shifting fuel to the supply tanks. Turnbull decided it was \u201cmore likely than not that the quantities of fuel displayed on the fuel quantity indication system of [the helicopter] contradicted the low fuel warnings, in a manner that persuaded Captain Traill that it was safe to continue flying\u201d. Thomas said his findings insulted the intelligence of those who knew about the aircraft\u2019s history. She said the model\u2019s maintenance manual had wrongly said a flameout time between engines would be about three to four minutes. In fact, the correct time was more than one minute but, because of the design of the fuel tanks, Traill had only 32 seconds before flameout. In a statement, she said of the victims: \u201cThis has devastated the lives of all who surround them and impacted on so many more.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Judicial Office for Scotland said: \u201cThe sheriff principal carefully considered all the evidence put before the inquiry before making his determination which fully sets out the reasons for his decisions.\u201d A spokesman for Airbus, which makes the Eurocopter, would not comment on her criticisms and reissued the statement it issued after Turnbull\u2019s ruling last week. The firm said it had cooperated with all the investigations into the crash and had taken note of the findings of the FAI and the previous investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. \u201cAll of us at the company remain deeply saddened by this tragic accident and the heavy loss of life. We would like to express once again our deepest sympathies to the families, friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe safety of our fleet remains our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything possible to ensure the safe operation of our helicopters by the thousands of operators whose crews and passengers rely on them every day all around the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
