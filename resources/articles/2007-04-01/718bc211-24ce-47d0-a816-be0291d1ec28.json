Fast, panicked, irresponsible, with a one-in-three success rate. What are your rules of shopping? Speed is of the essence. If you can't buy the right thing, buy something quickly. Do you always shop alone? Yes, absolutely golden rule. I am a nightmare to shop with or as an adviser. I get bored very quickly. What's your guiltiest purchase? Guitars. I have too many by miles - I am not sure I could admit in public how many. Which one purchase can't you get through the week without? Flapjacks - I have one every morning. It is the only thing that is constant in my life. I call them oat bars because someone told me oat was good for you, but then I found out what's really in them and they are actually a week's worth of dessert in a breakfast. What items are always in your basket at the supermarket? I never go - about twice a year I might do a holiday shop. It's a standing joke in my family about my overspending in supermarkets. I buy the things they think they will never sell and tonnes of sweets. What's the last thing you bought? A flapjack and before that, a false moustache - for a party. And the next thing you will buy? Probably a CD to cheer myself up because, after talking about this, I realise my shopping shortcomings and how much money I've wasted. It will be Findlay Brown's Separated by the Sea and I guarantee I will only like one track on it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
