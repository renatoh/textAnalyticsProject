The government is likely to have to defend again its plans for wide-ranging public sector job cuts with official data predicted to show the unemployment rate held at 7.9% in the three months to May. Trade unions are also warning of a continuing rise in the long-term unemployed. Still, economists in a Reuters poll predict the June claimant count will have fallen by 20,000 in June, having dropped a bigger than expected 30,900 in May. \"Unemployment could well continue to fall in the near term, but it is likely to head back up later this year and then increase further in 2011,\" predicted Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. \"Major job losses are clearly on the way in the public sector as the government looks to slash spending, and we doubt that the private sector will be able to fully compensate for this. Indeed, it may well be that the private sector becomes increasingly cautious on their employment plans due to concerns that the intensified fiscal squeeze will hold back growth.\" Many experts are sceptical over the coalition government's hopes for a brighter employment picture. A report today from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) warns that growth in the next few years has only to be slightly weaker than the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) current central forecast for the jobs outlook to look \"a lot worse\" than the government anticipates. The report predicts that the UK economy will need to grow by at least 2.5% a year between now and 2015 if the private sector is to create enough jobs to more than offset the employment impact of the impending squeeze in public spending. \"A slightly milder growth outcome \u2013 which many would consider a decent recovery in output given the various strong headwinds at present facing the economy \u2013 is easily as imaginable as the OBR's central forecast and would leave unemployment still close to 2.5 million by 2015, meaning Britain faces at least half a decade of serious prolonged jobs deficit,\" says John Philpott, chief economic adviser at the CIPD. \"So will fiscal pain spur private sector jobs gain as the coalition's economic strategy assumes? Yes, but probably not very much and certainly not any time soon.\" The central economic and employment forecast from fiscal watchdog the OBR shows the economy growing by well over 2.5% each year from 2012-2015. The total number of people in work starts to rise next year and continues to rise through to 2015, resulting in a net gain in employment of 1.3 million between 2010 and 2015. The CIPD, on slightly pessimistic growth assumptions, forecasts the economy will shed 300,000 jobs by 2012 before renewed job creation boosts employment by 2015 to about 100,000 above the level in 2010 \u2013 far short of the 1.3 million extra jobs the government expects. The TUC shares the concerns, with the trade unions group today claiming the private sector has a long way to go to make up for public sector job losses. Its analysis of the latest redundancy and vacancy figures suggest construction and science vacancies are still 50% down on pre-recession levels. The TUC says there were 10,000 vacancies in construction in May 2010, compared with 28,000 in April 2008 \u2013 the first month in which the UK moved into recession. Science was the next worst hit sector with vacancies falling by 49%, followed by manufacturing, down 46%, and then transport, down 33%. Across the economy there were 492,000 job vacancies in May 2010, a fall of 29 per cent compared to April 2008, when there were 692,000 vacancies, the TUC said. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"Economic recovery remains fragile. Even on the most optimistic assumptions recovery is not strong enough to generate new jobs for those being made redundant in the private and public sectors as a result of the spending cuts. \"Employers and unions worked very hard to keep unemployment below 2.5 million despite the deepest recession for 60 years, but this will make it harder for companies to create more jobs as the economy recovers. \"At best we can expect a jobless recovery and at worst a double-dip increase in the dole queues.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
