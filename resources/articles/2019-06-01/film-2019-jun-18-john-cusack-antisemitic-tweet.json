Cusack retweeted a quotation, accompanied by a Star of David image, popular among the far right: \u201cTo learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.\u201d It is often misattributed to Voltaire but is in fact a reworking of a quotation from American neo-nazi Kevin Alfred Strom. Cusack then added: \u201cFollow the money.\u201d He has since deleted the tweet. Cusack initially appeared to defend his tweet in subsequent Twitter posts, in which he added comments such as: \u201cYou think Israel isn\u2019t commuting [sic] atrocities against Palestinians? what planet are you on?\u201d He appears to have accepted that his original tweet was antisemitic, having posted: \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have antisemitic bone in your body, it is still an antisemitic cartoon.\u201d Suggesting that he thought he was using the quote to attack Israeli policy, he added: \u201cThe use of the star, even if it depicts the state of Israel \u2013 committing human rights violations \u2013 when combined with anti Jewish tropes about power \u2013 is antisemitic &amp; antisemitism has no place in any rational political dialoge [sic].\u201d He failed to address his own addition to the tweet, \u201cFollow the money\u201d, which incurred further accusations of antisemitism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
