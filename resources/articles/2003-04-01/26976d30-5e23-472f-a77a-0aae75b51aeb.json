And the word on the ground is that Herbie Hide, the former World Boxing Organisation heavy-weight champion who makes his professional comeback in Nottingham tonight, could be one of the fallen men. By common consent Muhammad Ali had reached the shot-to-pieces state by the time he fought and lost to Larry Holmes in 1980. In 1997 Sugar Ray Leonard was embarrassingly defeated by Hector Camacho when he was gone and many would suggest Nigel Benn was a shot fighter after his epic 1995 encounter with Gerald McClellan. Tonight, at the Nottingham Arena, where Howard Eastman defends his British middleweight title against the lightly regarded Scott Dann, Hide will shape up against the former Audley Harrison foe Derek McCafferty. And the question to be answered is whether or not Hide, the man who once prospered as the \"Dancing Destroyer\", remains a credible force. Certainly Hide has arrived in Britain from his new home in Las Vegas with some heavyweight support. Now expelled from the Mike Tyson camp, Hide's nominal manager-cum-cheerleader is the battle-fatigued Steve \"Crocodile\" Fitch, a professional loudmouth who knows a great deal more about the fight business than some of his detractors would have you believe. \"Herbie is back to bring some excitement to the heavyweights in Britain,\" says the Croc. \"What is happening now? I tell you, nothing. And Herbie can clean up. Danny Williams [the current British champion], Audrey [sic] Harrison, Frank Bruno if he wants to come back. Herbie can beat them all. He will win the British title and he is good enough to regain his world title. Definitely.\" Fitch bluster aside, Hide does look slim, fit and more vibrantly youthful than might be expected of a man who has been a professional fighter since 1989. Hard to believe he is still only 31. His numerous brushes with the law have been well documented - including court appearances for various charges from minor assault to kerb-crawling - contributing to his decision to settle in Las Vegas, away from his home town Norwich, but Hide claims he is approaching his trade with a new maturity. \"It's going to be great to be back. I have a new team and everything has been perfect. I have been working for the last two months and now is the time to think about giving all the British fighters a pay-day. I will start off with McCafferty, then Julius Francis, Danny Williams and Audley Harrison. I could be British champion again in two months.\" \"As for Audley, he couldn't break eggshells with a baseball bat! I won a world title at 21 and he won an Olympic medal when he was 29. He looks pathetic. Whoever is raving about him does not know about boxing.\" Hide's confidence might seem surprising for anyone who saw him stopped in only two rounds by the Zimbabwean journeyman Joseph Chingangu in his last fight more than 18 months ago, or to those who witnessed his second-round disintegration against Ukraine's Vitali Klitschko four years ago when he lost his WBO belt. But he arrives in Britain with a formidable training team of the former world champions Eddie Mustafa Muhammad and Mike McCallum. \"It took guts for Herbie to come to us in Vegas and say that he wanted to work,\" says Mustafa. \"He is dedicated and he looks good. He has had seven sparring partners and knocked five out.\" It sounds familiar. Hide always was one to batter lesser opposition, in the gym or the ring, but shrewd judges question his mental strength. But perhaps the biggest failing Hide has always had is self-doubt. In his first world-title shot in March 1995, against Riddick Bowe, he looked magnificent for three rounds before crumbling and his detractors might say he has never been the same man since. What Fitch, Muhammad and McCallum now have to establish is whether the old champ is still a real force."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
