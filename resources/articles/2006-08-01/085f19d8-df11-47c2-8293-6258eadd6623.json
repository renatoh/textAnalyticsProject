Liam Hogan's mother, Natasha, is expected to meet the plane at Gatwick Airport. Mrs Hogan, 34, a nurse at Gwent Royal Hospital in Newport, south Wales, flew back to Britain last Thursday with her two-year-old daughter Mia. The toddler survived the fall with little more than a broken arm after landing on her father. 'Sometimes the shock of it all is such that families choose not to travel with the dead bodies of their beloved,' said Petros Papadopetrakis, the undertaker who arranged Liam's return. 'Every year there are British holidaymakers who die in Crete, but in my experience this boy is by far the youngest.' Following a row with his wife on Tuesday evening, John Hogan grabbed the children as they slept, scaled the balcony and jumped four floors, landing in the hotel's paved garden. Since the tragedy, Liam's body had lain in the morgue of the University Hospital at Heraklion. At 7pm on Friday, Liam's grandmother, Josephine Hogan, 64, requested that she see her grandson one last time. John is not the first of her children to try to take his own life. One of his brothers committed suicide a few years ago. Mrs Hogan, of Bedminster, Bristol, flew to the island as soon as she heard of the tragedy. 'She was with him for about 10 minutes and cried throughout,' said Christos Papadopetrakis, who runs the funeral parlour with his father. 'It was a very emotional last farewell.' Hogan, 32, who suffered a broken arm, leg and chest injuries and underwent surgery as a result of the fall, is expected to remain under armed guard in a ward for prisoners for the next 10 days. A Foreign Office spokesman said Hogan would be arrested when he recovered from his injuries on suspicion of the murder of his son and the attempted murder of his daughter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
