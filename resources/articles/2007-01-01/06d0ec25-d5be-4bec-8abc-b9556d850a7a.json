Fewer than 18 months later, she's won the Irish equivalent of the Mercury Music prize and 13 Songs is being rereleased by a major label. Thus, her career path would be reminiscent of DIY artist-turned-Mercury nominee Kathryn Williams had Feeney not also dabbled in modelling, got three degrees and appeared in Riverdance. Although it shares Williams' intimate vocal style, 13 Songs often veers left-field towards the likes of Stina Nordenstam and Laurie Anderson. Classically trained, Feeney moonlights with the National Chamber Choir and songs about romantic obsession and depression are framed with cello, violins and even a ticking clock. The religious purity of her voice is showcased by the 28-second note she holds in Aching, but her trump card is the way every song sounds as if it is a privately shared confidence. With hooks as strong as those on Wastin' and You Broke the Magic, the world will listen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
