Mr Blair uses an article in the monthly magazine, Prospect, to set out his stall in ways which will infuriate enemies as diverse as Tony Benn, Ken Livingstone and Lord Hattersley. \"Constructive criticism is healthy, lazy negativism is not,\" he warns his unnamed opponents. The prime minister claims that his third way \"was always intended to renew and modernise progressive politics, not find a soggy compromise between left and right. \"Ideas are the key; and the tide of ideas is flowing in our direction,\" Mr Blair says, days before he meets the new hope of the right, US president George Bush. In his article he claims that the third way reflects the global centre-left's response to the collapse of communism and - in the west - the growing understanding of markets. Yet when planning and public ownership receded \"it seemed easier for the left to opt out of serious economics\". That was \"a position of wholly unnecessary defeatism and weakness. \"For the right to attack (us) is eminently sensible\" since a revitalised centre-left will marginalise the right, \"but for the left itself to join in is a curious form of self-mutilation\". In a fresh display of impatience with internal Labour attacks the prime minister also takes a swipe at opponents of the new technologies, includuing genetically-modified (GM) crops, as \"extreme greens who are anti-science fundamentalists\". Instead he lists \"the challenge of harnessing the new technologies to create wealth and meet human need\" as the first of six major issues which progressive governments must tackle. The other five are: transforming education to create \"a culture of high expectation\" for all; tackling inequality; modernising government beyond the old one-size-fits-all model; overcoming democratic alienation; and engaging in international cooperation as \"a matter of morality and enlightened self-interest\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
