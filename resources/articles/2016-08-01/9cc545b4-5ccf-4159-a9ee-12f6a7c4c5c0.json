Public Health England (PHE) said cases of meningitis W, which can cause life-changing disabilities and kills one in 10 who contract it, were on the rise. It is one of the most aggressive and dangerous forms of the disease. In 2009 there were 22 cases in England, but in the last year there have been more than 200. Young people going to university are at particular risk because they mix with so many new people, some of whom may be carrying the meningococcal bacteria that cause meningitis W and septicaemia or blood poisoning. PHE urged them to be immunised with a new vaccine, introduced last year, which protects against four strains of the bacterial infection \u2013 A, C, Y and W. Between 2009 and 2012, there were just four deaths from meningitis W, but in 2013-14, the last year for which figures are available, the figure rose to 24. For the first time in a decade, babies and toddlers were among those who died. As other strains have become less of a problem, meningitis W now accounts for a quarter of all meningitis infections. \u201cSince 2009, there has been a rapid increase in cases of Men W across England, with students particularly at risk,\u201d said Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at PHE. \u201cProtecting young people from this potentially deadly disease as they embark upon one of the most important periods of their lives is vitally important. The vaccination will save lives and prevent lifelong devastating disability. \u201cWe are encouraging all eligible 17 and 18-year-olds who have just left school to get vaccinated, particularly those heading to college or university. Young people and those around them should be alert to the signs and symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia. Get vaccinated as soon as possible, remain vigilant and seek urgent medical help if you have concerns for yourself or friends.\u201d Meningococcal bacteria live in the back of the nose and throat in about one in 10 of the population without causing any illness. The bacteria is spread from person to person by close contact with a person carrying the bacteria, such as coughing, kissing and sneezing. All meningococcal bacteria can cause meningitis and septicaemia, but meningitis W can also cause other illnesses such as pneumonia and joint infections. The early symptoms are headache, vomiting, muscle pain, fever and cold hands and feet. GPs have been asked to call in young people up to the age of 25 for vaccination. Universities have also been asked to urge students who have not been vaccinated at home to get the jab locally. Meningitis charities are also sounding the alarm. \u201cUp to a quarter of students carry the bacteria that can cause meningitis compared to one in ten of the general population. In the UK every university could experience at least one case of meningitis amongst its students within the first term,\u201d said Liz Brown, the chief executive of Meningitis Now. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that those going to Uni this autumn are not complacent about the threat of meningitis. We urge them to take up this lifesaving vaccine before they go.\u201d Vinny Smith, the chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging students going to uni for the first time to do something great today. By getting this free meningitis vaccine from your GP you\u2019re not only protecting yourself from a potentially deadly disease, but also protecting others by stopping the spread. \u201cIt\u2019s also vital to watch out for your friends if they\u2019re unwell. If people do have meningitis it can be like a very bad hangover that quickly gets worse. It can be deadly, so act fast and get medical help.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
