A third successive away win courtesy of \u00c1lvaro Morata\u2019s brilliant hat-trick ensured they remain within touching distance of the two Manchester clubs at the top of the nascent table, even if Conte will be more than happy to remain the shadows for now. However, after the turbulence created by Diego Costa\u2019s fractious departure and the surprise opening-day defeat at home against Burnley, it is a measure of their manager\u2019s ability that his side prepare to face City in the first big title showdown of the season at Stamford Bridge on Saturday three points better off than at the same stage 12 months ago. Chelsea\u2019s defeat against Arsenal in their sixth game of the last campaign heralded the switch to the now familiar back three as they embarked on a winning run of 13 matches. This time around, with Morata already finding his feet up front in place of Costa and his fellow new arrival Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko beginning to form a formidable partnership with N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 in central midfield, Conte will have no need to instigate such sweeping changes \u2013 especially given that Eden Hazard has yet to start in the Premier League after his ankle injury. \u201cStoke away is a hard game and last year we only won in the last minutes,\u201d said the goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, who will be fit to face his former club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in Wednesday\u2019s Champions League tie after emerging unscathed from a nasty fall in the second half. \u201cThis year Arsenal lost here. United struggled at 2-2, so to win by four is pleasing.\u201d In truth the scoreline against a side without three of their frontline defenders perhaps flattered Chelsea somewhat, even if Morata deserved all the plaudits for his superb display. At first glance the player who arrived at Juventus from Real Madrid in 2014 four days after Conte had left on his way to taking over as Italy manager does not appear to possess any special attributes. But the 24-year-old showed a deceptively gliding turn of pace to skip past Darren Fletcher for his second goal and was also a physical threat for Stoke\u2019s makeshift backline throughout. \u201cI think now he is totally involved with our style of football and idea,\u201d Conte said. \u201cHe is very strong and you can see that today. A lot of good contact and tackles. I think he showed he is a really good, complete player. He didn\u2019t play a lot with Real Madrid and Juventus but now he has a great chance to show he is a really good striker, a fantastic striker.\u201d But while Morata can expect a hostile reception on his return to the Spanish capital on Wednesday, Courtois is not anticipating any such problems. The Belgium international spent three seasons on loan at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n between 2011 and 2014 and is looking forward to experiencing their the brand new 68,000-seater Wanda Metropolitano stadium. \u201cI remember being at the presentation of the new stadium when they first revealed it,\u201d he said. \u201cI went there to see the place when there was only one stand \u2013 the old one \u2013 and they were doing the groundwork. It will be nice to see it. \u201c\u00c1lvaro played a lot of games against Atl\u00e9tico. I think it will be a big game against his old rivals. It will be more friendly for me but between the 90 minutes I will also be a rival of Atl\u00e9tico.\u201d That should at least provide Conte with more of a barometer for his side\u2019s European ambitions than the 6-0 thrashing of Qarabag in the opening match, with the free-scoring City also looming large as the title race begins to take shape. \u201cIt will be interesting for us,\u201d Courtois said. \u201cWe have started this difficult week well with a good victory against Stoke and hopefully Wednesday and Saturday we will carry this good form on. \u201cThe top teams are doing well this season and we are happy to be close to the top. If we want to close that gap we need to try and win next week.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
