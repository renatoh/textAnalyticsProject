With 11 minutes of the European Cup final remaining he flew down the right wing, skinned his marker and whipped in the kind of low, fast cross that defenders hate. Had either Raul or Fernando Morientes succeeded in making contact, McManaman would have become one of the night's heroes and Eriksson would have faced pointed questions about his refusal to take the former Liverpool man to the World Cup. But the ball was fumbled away, just as the England coach will no doubt deflect suggestions that he should be prepared to make one last adjustment to his disrupted midfield. By the time McManaman arrived on the field, in place of the subdued and ineffective Luis Figo, Real Madrid were beginning to concern themselves primarily with holding on to their 2-1 lead. So he ran hard in support of his colleagues, stopped opponents by whatever means necessary, and generally made himself useful. It seems a shame that a man who has so clearly earned the respect of the players and fans of Europe's leading club should not have been able to produce the sort of performances for England that would have persuaded Eriksson of his value. But presumably there will always be the memory of his dreadful 20 minutes against Albania to stand in the way of renewed preferment. It was, of course, absurdly unrealistic to hope last night's occasion could live up to the memories of the match everyone has been talking about this week. But there could be no denying that it got off to a faster start. And when Lucio equalised Raul's opening goal after 14 minutes, the mirage of a repeat of that immortal 7-3 scoreline from 42 years ago drifted across the Glasgow night. And then, on the stroke of half-time, came Zinedine Zidane's masterpiece. Maybe, just maybe, history was about to be repeated. But then someone remembered that the teams went in for the interval in 1960 with Real Madrid leading the Germans 3-1, so the romantics among us were obviously in for a disappointment. Whatever you have been told this week is true. The 20th century had nothing finer to offer than the night in 1960 when 127,000 gathered in Hampden Park to watch the match between Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt. It was Fonteyn and Nureyev, Bob Dylan at the Royal Albert Hall, the first night of The Rite of Spring, Olivier at his peak, the Armory Show and the Sydney Opera House rolled into one. Even today, the grainy black and white images prove that the legend has not suffered from the indignity of exaggeration. Last night it was possible to share the stadium with Alfredo di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas, scorers of all Real's goals that night, and with several other members of both the 1960 finalists. And it was tempting, of course, to seek parallels. Could Zidane and Figo, brought to Madrid for \u00a348m and \u00a328m respectively, prove themselves worthy heirs to Don Alfredo and the Galloping Major? A resounding yes and no respectively, as it turned out. Zidane and Figo have less time and space in which to do their work, of course, but they also have vastly higher salaries, far more scientific training regimes, friendlier pitches and a more obedient ball. There is a case for suggesting that their arrival has made Real less of a team than they were three or four years ago, when Raul, Savio and Morientes were bringing the art of intricate approach play to new heights of sophistication. Although no one would accuse Zidane, at least, of being anything but a wholehearted and thoroughly altruistic player, the introduction of the two expensive newcomers into the midfield put the emphasis back on individual creativity. The lack of a real team ethic could be seen in Real's recent disappointments in the King's Cup and the Spanish league, which failed to provide the expected climax to their centenary season. As the German chancellor and the king of Spain looked down, the Prince of Castille set fire to the evening with the most impertinent of goals. In fact it took Raul's team-mates more than 20 minutes to put a decent sequence of passes together, but once Zidane found the pace of the match there was always the possibility that the heights would be reached, and it was fitting that the referee should blow the final whistle just as he was caressing yet another lovely ball down the touchline to a colleague. And Steve McManaman left Glasgow with a second European Cup winner's medal, which is some sort of consolation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
