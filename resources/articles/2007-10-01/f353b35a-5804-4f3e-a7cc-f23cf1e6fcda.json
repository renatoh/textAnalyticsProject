So far this season, United have been more shot-shy than Tony Adams post 12-steps, but tonight might just be different. Not only are they playing Roma, who they pinged seven past back in March, but Sir Alex Ferguson has also jiggled things around up front, sending Carlos Tevez and Ryan Giggs to the bench and starting with Louis Saha. But while the bookies make United huge odds-on favourites to win, I fancy Roma might sneak something from this. Groundwatch: It's eight degrees and wet in Manchester, as if you needed telling. \"What are the chances young Cristiano Ronaldo gets chopped sown inside minutes after his peptalk,\" asks Mike Scott. 10-1 on? 1 min: We're off! Roma, who are playing from right to left on the TV, get things underway. \"Is Opta keeping any stats on the number of eye-rolling double-teapots/exasperated shrugs we will be treated to by Ronaldo and Totti tonight?\" chuckles Gary Naylor. \"Perhaps if we edit in a bit of Thierry, there's a DVD in it? All three would walk into parts, should the Carry-Ons be revived.\" A confession: I love Totti. I know he bottles it now and again on big occasions, but he can be utterly sublime. 3 min: Roma have barely touched the ball in the opening couple of minutes; United string it around nicely until Rio Ferdinand overhits a long ball straight to Curci. And to think some people reckoned he was the second coming of Bobby Moore. 5 min: Roma have 10 men behind the ball, but they can't stop United cutting through them down the right. Saha finds space but overhits his cross and the giallorossi clear. \"Hmmm,\" says the extravagantly monikered Emma El\u00edsabet Gr\u00edmsd\u00f3ttir. \"Starting with Saha is all well and good in theory, but will he still be fit come half-time?\" You sound like a someone out of Sir Alex's heart. 7 min: Better from Roma. A series of lovely one-touch triangles, with Totti instrumental, comes to an end when Mancini tries to take on O'Shea down the left wing and is muscled off the ball. 9 min: Totti hits a 30-yard sizzler straight into the arms of Kuszczak. \"Re: sublime Totti: Christian Poulsen would agree,\" scoffs Shreerang Sarpotdar. 11 min: A wonderful reverse halfway-line pass from Totti puts Mancini in the clear. He's one-on-one with Kuszczak, and lining up to shoot, but then the referee's assistant starts flagging wildly. And wrongly: replays show Mancini was two yards onside. 13 min: Scholes gives it away - again - and suddenly Roma fast break. Totti twists in a decent position just outside the box, but then theatrically falls under the lightest of challenges by Vidic. Gary Naylor (1st minute) will be pleased. A minute later Totti lets fly from 25 yards, but Kuszczak saves comfortably. 16 min: \"Can you explain the line 'United have been more shot-shy than Tony Adams post 12-steps' in your preamble?\" asks Hans Mulder. \"I am a Dutch Arsenal fan living in England for 14 years now and have read his autobiography, but can't make the link between being shot shy and Legend Tony's goal prowess. I now feel at risk of being rumbled by my mates about my lack of knowledge of a well know bit of Arsenal history.\" No need to fear, Hans. It was a booze reference (surely the shots/twelve steps was obvious? Oh.) 18 min: Both sides have been content to play keep-ball so far, and while it's been pleasing on the eye, there have been very few chances. Saying that, Perotta has just chopped down Nani, 25 yards out. Ronaldo closes his eyes and shapes up to hit it ... 19 min: ... and smacks it into the wall. 22 min: First decent chance of the game for United: Nani's cross is headed over from eight yards by Ronaldo. Saying that, he was under pressure from Mexes, so it was probably only a half chance. 25 min: This reminds me of watching Real Madrid v Roma at the Bernabeu a few years ago; that night Real had more possession and pressure, but Roma - with Totti leading the line - always looked dangerous on the break. Tonight Roma have had 11 men behind the ball at times, but Totti is moving in and out of the hole, orchestrating things cleverly and they're holding their own. 27 min: United are beginning to increase the pressure: Nani's overhit cross turns into a dangerous shot and Curci does well to palm it clear. \"Presumably Gary Naylor has your details on the email equivalent of speed dial,\" scoffs Ronan Hayes. \"What other explanation can there be for his simultaneous appearance on three MBM updates?\" 29 min: After a shoddy pass from Juan, Saha gets the chance to run at Roma's centre-backs for the first time tonight. He scampers five, 10, 15 yards and then shoots straight at Curci. 31 min: Totti wins a free-kick 35-yards out by interlocking his legs with Scholes and then lets fly with a low skimmer. Kuszczak fumbles initially before smothering his body on the ball. 33 min: Another free-kick, 30 yards out, this time to United. Ronaldo again lets fly but Curci makes a decent fingertips-on-the-ground save. Thirty seconds later, United attack again - and Rooney, who's just 10 yards out, somehow fizzles his volley over the bar. 35 min: It's all United now. Curci double-punches Nani's corner clear before collapsing theatrically, clutching his knee. But after receiving magic spray from Roma's physio he's miraculously on his feet again. 38 min: [Minute-by-minute reporter dons anorak] Number of shots so far: United 5-4 Roma. \"You were a bit mean to Hans (16 mins),\" says Alan Bright. \"Let me explain Hans: a shot can mean a measure of alcohol such as whisky. Mr Ingle was - I imagine - referring to Tony Adams' not drinking anymore and thus avoiding shots.\" 40 min: A frankly shocking pass from Totti to no one allows United to attack down the right. Rooney, who has been quiet so far, is beginning to build up a head of steam when he's cynically chopped down by Mexes. 43 min: Totti interlinks with Giuly before trying to send Cicinho in down the right ... but, to wild guffaws from the Old Trafford crowd, the Brazilian slips on the turf. \"'It's a kind of a prawn sandwich night, isn't it?' - so says ESPN commentator Tommy 'Onion Bag' Smyth,\" says Bill Ceccotti. I've no idea what Smyth is talking about Bill. Anyone? 45 min: Nice interplay in the attacking third from Roma ... but Cicinho's cross is directed towards Giuly, the smallest player on the pitch, and United clear. We have one minute of added time. 45+1 min: A superb pass by Ronaldo doodles Cicinho and suddenly Evra is free down the left ... but Mexes makes a fine sliding tackle. The resulting corner is cleared and that's half-time. United have had the edge on possession, but while it's been enjoyable to watch there have been very few clear-cut chances. Half-time 46 min: We're off again. \"Re: Tommy Smyth's 'prawn sandwich night' comment - fear not Sean,\" says Ronan Hayes. \"From unfortunate experience, I know that Tommy 'Onion Bag' Smyth has no idea what Tommy Smyth is talking about.\" 47 min: United charge out of the blocks: Ronaldo offers Juan more lollipops than a Tour De France caravan before fizzing a low cross into the area. Sadly for United there's no one to put it into the net. 49 min: What a chance for Roma! Giuly crosses it into the box, Vidic slips and Totti is in, seven yards out. But from a tight angle, and with Kuszczak closing, Roma's captain scoops it over the bar. He really should have scored. 51 min: So close! Aquilani, who has been tigerish in protecting Roma's back four tonight, takes Totti's pass and lets fly from 20 yards out. It flies over the post by inches. \"Tommy Smyth is the living embodiment of evil,\" insists Steve Korowitz. \"If you ask most football supporters in the US if they hate George W Bush or Smyth more, you'd have some head-scratching, and Tommy hasn't invaded anyone lately. He did invade the US many years ago before there was a Premier League, and now we can't get him to leave. He's the big reason most of us English-only speakers watch the World Cup matches on the Spanish-language station. He's the worst soccerball commentator on the planet, bar none, and having spent enough time watching Gary Lineker et al, I can say that with some confidence.\" 54 min: Nani, who has been United's best player tonight, goes past Perotta before standing one up. The cross hits the top of the crossbar before bouncing out for a goal kick. \"Has Fergie now morphed into fellow Scotsman George Graham?\" asks Rob Hisnay, who is \"proud to be from Vermont, the only US state that Bush has not visited\". Think it happened a while ago, Rob: Fergie became far more defensive in Europe after that 3-2 defeat to Real Madrid back in 2000. If you ask me, they should play at a much higher tempo in Europe, especially at home, but then I'm an incurably romantic. 57 min: This has got 0-0 written all over it: both teams would probably settle for a draw and take their chances against Dynamo Kiev and Sporting Lisbon. 60 min: Another half-chance for Aquilani, who sidefoots just wide from 20 yards. But he pulls a muscle in the process and is stretchered off. 62 min: Roma sub: Aquilani off, Pizarro on. Meanwhile more anti-Smyth emails. \"As we learned during the World Cup, Americans can't commentate on soccer,\" says Patrick Dillon. \"So we have Tommy Smyth. He has the gift of gab, especially in his La Liga matches: Messi has 'more tricks than a monkey in a monkey tree,' Cannavaro is 'like a five-legged giraffe,' and everyone is always 'vibrating like a guitar string.'\" 64 min: Roma continue to have the better of the second half. Totti holds off Ferdinand before dobbing it to Pizarro, whose shot thunders into a United defender. United then break but Nani goes for glory from a difficult angle ... and sends his shot high and wide. 66 min: Much better from Rooney, who has been quiet tonight. He bulls his way into the area but Curci easily tips his shot around the post. From the corner, both Curci and Mexes fall over clutching their faces. To loud cheers, referee Manuel Enrique Mejuto Gonzalez tells them both to get up. 68 min: United sub: Saha off, Tevez on. Mancini tumbles in the box under pressure from Carrick, but the referee rightly isn't buying it. 69 min: Rooney performs an exquisite cutback, fooling three Roma defenders, before scooping it into the box. It deflects off a Roma defender before Ronaldo backheels into the net. But before he can celebrate the referee blows up for offside. GOAL! Man Utd 1-0 Roma (Rooney 70): That goal counts, however! Nani dinks it into Rooney, who takes the pass in his stride before firing low past Curci. United are ahead! 73 min: United are pressing for a second. Or at least they were until Rooney's pass went straight to Cicinho. \"Tommy Smyth also corrupts the airwaves of New Zealand for games covered by ESPN (annoyingly these include England games and the FA Cup),\" says Jon Saunders. \"There can be no argument that he is the worst commentator in history. I've never seen anyone so regularly misidentify players, stadiums and even whole teams. Incidentally does anyone know why ESPN coverage always has that lurid edge to it (grass that bit too green, picture just slightly fuzzy).\" Well? 75 min: Roma sub: Mancini off, Vucinic on. 77 min: Superb from Tevez, who dukes like a disco dancer to take it past De Rossi before lashing a 25-yard screamer just past the post. It missed by this much. 79 min: Roma are still looking dangerous on the break - Perotta looked like squeezing his way through Ferdinand before put in an excellent block. \"At least Tommy Smyth has some level of comprehensibility,\" says Patrick Sullivan. \"The other bloke we have to hear in the US is Ray Hudson, who finds everyone 'orgasmic' and equates Barca to kitchen utensils. Is this the best your side of the pond can deliver?\" Quite probably. 81 min: United sub: Nani off, Giggs on. \"Pizaro is a one-trick pony,\" says James Elliot in Roma. \"I predict he does at least 10 dragback urns within five minutes of coming on.\" He's done absolutely nothing so far. 82 min: Roma sub: the disappointing Giuly off, Esposito on. 84 min: What a chance for Roma! Totti's backpost cross is flicked across goal by De Rossi .. and right into Perrotta's path. He's ten yards out, unmarked, and central ... but he can only shank it more horribly than a Sunday golfer on the first tee. 85 min: United sub: Rooney off, Anderson on. Can United record yet another 1-0 win? 86 min: Another delay in play while Ronaldo gets treated for an eye injury. \"Am lying here in a Butlins-style resort near the Great Barrier Reef (bingo poor, food worse, Filipino cover band just fine) furtively scrolling through MBM whilst my family sleeps on,\" says Rick Drury. \"Disappointed I can't watch ESPN; ecstatic I can't hear Smyth, for he is Beelzebub's handmaid.\" 88 min: What a miss by Esposito! Totti's sumptuous backheel plays in Vucinic, who squares it to Esposito, 10 yards out, unmarked, central ... but he fires it inches wide. Roma really should be leaving Old Trafford with something from this game ... but they can't keep wasting chances like this. 89 min: Cristiano Ronaldo leaves this pitch, blood splurging from a cut in his eye. United have used all their subs and will be playing the last few minutes with 10 men. 90 min: Three added minutes. De Rossi tries to play in Vucinic, but Ferdinand - who has played very well tonight - intercepts. 90+2: No signs here of a late Roma equaliser. Giggs plays in Anderson, who is operating as a lone striker, but he's just offside. \"I can't believe I'm defending Tommy Smyth, but at last year's World Cup I was begging for Tommy to show up and commentate,\" says Jon Cummins. \"Instead ESPN stuck us with Dave 'Mr Baseball' O'Brien, and Marcelo 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' Balboa. And don't even get me started on Julie Foudy, who introduced everyone to the 'bunker defence' at the 98 World Cup, presumably during a Germany game.\" Full time: Peep! Peep! That's it, United hold on to record a narrow and not entirely convincing victory. The final word goes to Graham Parker who says the \"the green lurid picture on ESPN is caused by the NTSC system.\" So now you know.
