There are traits in this Salford side which should provide optimism aplenty. In many ways Salford are a team like no other, that much is obvious even this early in the season. On occasions they are irresistible but they are also equally capable of going from the sublime to the ridiculous in a matter of moments. Given how close they came to relegation last year it is easy to forget that without a six-point deduction imposed on them midway through 2016, Salford would have been in the top eight and a world away from the Million Pound Game. This year, there are no such penalties on the horizon and with O\u2019Brien pulling the strings and the highly regardedWatson in charge, perhaps the future can be bright for a side who have underachieved for so long. Huddersfield played their part in a thrilling game and on occasions looked capable of a second consecutive victory to open the season, but it was O\u2019Brien\u2019s brilliance which ultimately proved decisive. \u201cLast year we were in tight games and were coming out on the wrong side of them,\u201d Watson said. \u201cTo learn to win those tight games you\u2019ve got to first go through being in them and we\u2019re starting to learn.\u201d Huddersfield would have gone top of the early table with a win here \u2013 perhaps nothing to shout about too loudly in mid-February \u2013 but they were unable to back up last weekend\u2019s impressive victory against Widnes. There were positives, though: Danny Brough remains Super League\u2019s fine wine, seemingly getting better and better with age, while there were impressive contributions from the forwards Kruise Leeming and Sebastine Ikahihifo. But this was a night when Huddersfield and their coach, Rick Stone, were left to rue what might have been. \u201cI think we just got beat by a hungrier team,\u201d Stone said. \u201cLast week was only one week; one swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer and no team wants to be beaten in the first two weeks. \u201cI think we saw that tonight with Salford \u2013 they deserved the win.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s right boot was called into action early on as he kicked Salford into a 2-0 lead. Although Huddersfield went ahead courtesy of Jermaine McGillvary\u2019s try Salford regained a lead they would not surrender for the remainder of the evening when Junior Sa\u2019u crossed, before another penalty from O\u2019Brien opened up a 10-4 half-time lead. It got even better after the interval when a magnificent 40-20 from Michael Dobson laid the platform for O\u2019Brien to dart through for his first try of the night. Huddersfield rallied and two quick tries from Alex Mellor, both laid on by the outstanding Brough, reduced the gap to only two points. The Salford of 2016 might have buckled at that point \u2013 and again in the closing stages when Ukuma Ta\u2019ai reduced the gap to two for a third time \u2013 but not this current crop. O\u2019Brien\u2019s second had restored Salford\u2019s lead to eight before, late on, Josh Jones produced a moment which encapsulated everything good about the Red Devils. He refused to be go down, bumping off five Huddersfield defenders in charging over from close range to secure an impressive victory.
