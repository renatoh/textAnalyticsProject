At the end of May the new Star Office version 6 was released. It's very similar to Microsoft Office and is compatible with Microsoft files up to office XP and anything earlier so you can exchange files between the two products with ease. It offers word processing, database, presentation, spreadsheet and something Office hasn't got - a good vector drawing package. The total cost is only \u00a3150 for secondary and \u00a350 primary for a complete site licence to include free home for staff and hotline support. Available from Learning pathways 0800 7836025 or www.learnpath.com What is the best search engine to use for the internet and where can I find out about the best websites? The new BBC search engine, BBCi, looks impressive. It features a simple search option and is well filtered against inappropriate material. Carel Press provides a key organisations book and CD-rom with web and email contacts for over 1,500 key educational sites and services (www.carelpress.com). Finally you can browse for websites using the Dewey decimal classification where subjects areas are allocated a numeric code on the University of Wolverhampton site ( www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/). Can I use the old school camcorder with new digital video-editing software? The Directors Cut box from Miglia (www.miglia.com) for \u00a3299 + VAT is a breakthrough piece of hardware. It's a small, neat box that allows any video camera or VCR with a video output to be linked to an Apple Mac or a PC fitted with a firewire card. Then all you need is some editing software such as iMovie, provided free with Apple. RM has recently launched two new video-editing PCs, using the acclaimed Pinnacle cards and software and the box will also work with them. Its new RM Studio DV system costs less than \u00a3750 ( www.rm.com). How can I get more images into my worksheets? A scanner at around \u00a350 is the simplest way to get hand-drawn art onto a computer printout. To find existing images and photographs online it's still hard to beat the search engine at www.google.co.uk that can sift through 330,000,000 images in under half a second. I missed the New Opportunities Fund training. Is there a standard qualification I can take to demonstrate and consolidate my developing ICT skills? Try the European Computer driving licence (www.ecdl.co.uk). It's a Europe-wide qualification which lets you demonstrate your ICT competence with a range of software. Used in class As the Sats exams finish and primary schools breathe a sigh of relief, attention turns to secondary transfer and the nature of the record students will take with them when they leave to go to the big school. One school has pioneered the use of image and sound as a natural part of daily learning - video clips of field trips flit the network and children are reminded of past activities by digital still photos. Its latest project is a digital leavers' book - an electronic portfolio which all children take with them detailing their achievements and experience. At Gateway Primary in north London, 94% of its 524 pupils don't speak English as their mother tongue. It regulary uses image and video clips across its large, distributed computer network, in which every classroom has two networked computers. \"We use scanners, digital cameras and videos extensively to document and examine the children's world,\" said Keith Duggan, deputy head and ICT specialist. \"Use of digital equipment means we can record and review immediately so that the children can focus on what they have seen or the language they need to describe it. This does not replace a trip to the local market but enhances the visit and allows staff to develop it further back in the classroom.\" In their final term, year 6 pupils use this digital library to produce a multimedia CD of their school life. \"It resembles many leavers' books, but it also contains videos of shows, trips and school life, scanned images or digital photos of some of their work and their reflections, as recorded sound files of their life and future. We use Bookbuilder from SPA to organise the work on the CD (www.spasoft.co.uk) - it's nice and simple for teachers to use.\" The children have even installed the reader software for the discs at the local library so those without access to a home computer can show it to their families. \"Now we hope to develop the project to include more elements of the children's current work,\" said Duggan. \"The enhancement of this work is only possible because many staff have been able to attend a wide range of courses, looking at the potential of this resource. High quality Inset does not come cheap, and with the many pressures on school budgets and time it's tempting to say no. However, if we want to realise the potential of this exciting tool, Inset, with the chance to share ideas, is what we need.\" Email your questions to: john@aardvarkwisdom.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
