Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat member of the House committee conducting a probe into allegedly improper actions at the IRS, said that testimony from the unnamed employee of the tax office in Cincinnati, Ohio went \"a long way\" towards proving that the White House played no part in the scandal. Cummings also released a partial transcript of the evidence in which the individual implied that the setting aside of applications from rightwing groups was intended to ensure that their treatment was consistent. \"He is a conservative Republican working for the IRS,\" Cummings told CNN's State of the Union, adding: \"Based upon everything I've seen, the case is solved. And if it were me, I would wrap this case up and move on.\" The news comes as opponents of the Obama administration continue to pin the blame for IRS targeting of Tea Party groups on the White House, with some suggesting that senior administration officials sanctioned the extra scrutiny for political gain. According to CNN, investigators asked the Cincinnati office manager outright if concentrating on Tea Party forms was intended to put pressure on \"the president's political enemies\". \"I do not believe that the screening of these cases had anything to do, other than consistency and identifying issues that needed to have further development,\" the IRS employee is said to have replied. The scandal has already seen acting IRS chief Steven Miller ousted from his post. But opponents of the president have sought to keep pressure on the administration over the issue. Cummings threatened to release a full transcript of the committee's interview with IRS officials, if the panel's Republican chair Darrell Issa refused to do so by the end of the week. The pair have so far only released excerpts that back their own claims in regards to the IRS investigation. In a statement released on Sunday, Issa said: \"The testimony excerpts ranking member Cummings revealed today did not provide anything enlightening or contradict other witness accounts. The only thing ranking member Cummings left clear in his comments today is that if it were up to him the investigation would be closed.\" \"The American public wants to know why targeting occurred and who was involved,\" he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
