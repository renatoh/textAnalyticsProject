Katyusha rockets and other equipment are still being sent from Damascus into Lebanon as fighting continues in the south, a senior Israeli foreign ministry official told the Guardian yesterday. Israel says Syrian or Iranian-supplied military material has been hit in its air strikes on the Beirut-Damascus road, though Israel has been reluctant to reveal this for fear of exposing its intelligence sources. Syria claims the vehicles are carrying humanitarian or medical supplies. Israel's hope is that after another week to 10 days of fighting, Hizbullah will be pushed away from the border area. Israel no longer believes the Shia movement can be completely disarmed, partly because some of its forces are out of reach and partly because there is a limit to how long military action can continue even with the blessing of the US. In this context, a significant shift in Israeli thinking came last Friday when the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, signalled his readiness to accept an international stabilisation force in south Lebanon. The idea was first mooted at the G8 meeting in St Petersburg last week. Israel has also signalled its readiness to surrender the 25sq km of the Shebaa Farms, on the border between Syria and Lebanon but occupied by Israel since its pullout from Lebanon six years ago. That would strengthen the Lebanese government and undermine Hizbullah's claim to be resisting Israeli \"occupation\". It hopes the overall effect would be to weaken Iran's ability to interfere in the region. Israel's view, shared by the US, is that Iran has been using its relationship with Hizbullah to build a \"forward base\" for any future confrontation over its nuclear weapons. That explains, in the words of one Israeli analyst, why the US is happy to see Israel take its time, and why Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, is not urging Israel to stop fighting before it is ready. \"Make no mistake: Condi isn't coming here to pressure Israel into a ceasefire,\" said the Yediot Aharonot journalist Sima Kadmon. \"She's coming to check up that we're not getting this war wrong and not messing up the opportunity to be the long, strong arm of the US, just as Hizbullah is the long arm of Iran.\" Israel has protested from the start of the crisis that Syria was backing the Lebanese guerrillas but has been careful to avoid military operations that could escalate into a clash with Syria - one of the factors that made the 1982 war a wider and more dangerous conflict. Syria has said it would not sit idly by if Israeli forces came too close to Damascus, but it has made no military moves. Its eventual goal is to recover the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since the 1967 war. Syria is difficult to deal with because it has been in the doghouse internationally since last year's assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri, which worsened Damascus's relations with the EU. The US withdrew its ambassador and Ms Rice has shown no sign of wanting to give Syria a role in ending this crisis. \"Only coercive diplomacy will work,\" said the senior Israeli official. President Bashar al-Assad's support for Hizbullah was one reason the UN called two years ago for Syria to remove its troops from Lebanon. UN security council resolution 1559 also called for Hizbullah to be disarmed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
