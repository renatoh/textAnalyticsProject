The clash of traditional influences and psychedelia may have started with the Incredible String Band and the experimental folk artists of the 70s, but is now an established strand of the new folk scene, thanks to bands like this five-piece from Manchester. Samson &amp; Delilah features the husband-and-wife team Sam Lench and Anna Zweck, who are both singers, songwriters and multi-instrumentalists, with Lench playing guitar, accordion, cittern and viola, and Zweck playing piano and flute. The other three members add further vocals, bass, drums, piccolo and vibraphone. The album was mostly recorded live, in a Victorian concert hall, and shifts between quirky, gently eerie settings and passages that make use of sparse piano work and vocals that switch from the scarcely audible to rousing harmonies. It's a brave fusion, and it mostly works, thanks to the constantly changing dynamics of the music and melodies that are often as sturdy as great hymns. There's also some bold production work, with songs like Eyes of Son, starting with Zweck's quiet vocals and minimalist piano and building up to sturdy harmony singing, while Black Dog sounds like an edgy, accordion-backed English dance tune, and Lench provides a gently jaunty treatment of the one traditional song, Begone Dull Care. This should be a band to watch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
