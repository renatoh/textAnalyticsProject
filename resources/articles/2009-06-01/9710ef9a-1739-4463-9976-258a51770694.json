After a storied career, Brown turned his hand to acting and social activism. In the 60s, he helped set up the Black Economic Union, which helped businesses owned by African-Americans, and was one of Muhammed Ali's most vocal supporters when the boxer defied the US Army draft. Anyway, enough biography. In an HBO programme due to be shown in the US later this week Borwn had this to say about the apparent lack of social activism shown by some of the leading black athletes in recent years: \"There are one or two individuals in this country that are black that have been put in front of us as an example. But they're basically under a system that says, 'Hey, they're not gonna do a certain thing.' Yes, that disappoints me because I know they both know better.\" And then this: Questioner \"Tiger and Michael (Jordan)?\" \" Yeah, I know they both know better, OK. And I know they both can do better without hurting themselves....You know what's so interesting about Tiger to me? If it was just a matter of me looking at an individual that's a monster competitor, this cat is a mamajama; he is a killer. He'll run over you, he'll kick your ass. But as an individual for social change, or any of that kind of ----? Terrible. Terrible. Because he can get away with teaching kids to play golf, and that's his contribution. And in the real world, man, I can't teach no kids to play golf and that's my contribution, if I got that kind of power.\" Woods has heard this kind of thing a million times before, including from Brown, and hasn't changed his approach one iota. Whenever the subject comes up, he points to the work of the Tiger Woods Foundation and moves on. Maybe his new friend Barack Obama will have some infuence. Don't bank on it though."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
