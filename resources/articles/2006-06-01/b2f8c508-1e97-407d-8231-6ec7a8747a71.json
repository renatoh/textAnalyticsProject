I managed 19min 44sec, four minutes ahead of the next guy, but the time was meaningless because of the wind, which meant I went out at 26mph and did the return at 40mph. You can't get more low-key than a British time trial, where you change in a lay-by or a village hall, and race 'out and home' among all the other traffic. It's a curious way to prepare for the world's biggest bike race, but Chris Boardman did a local 10 before he won the prologue in 1994. It took me a while to come round from the disappointment of finishing only twenty-first in the Dauphine Libere prologue. I didn't think about it initially because the race went on for a week, but when I came home I realised that was the first major disappointment of my cycling career, the first time I had really prepared for something and failed in terms of being a long way off the pace. I couldn't work out what went wrong, because I was going better than I thought in terms of the figures, but I've concluded I made a few errors the week before. I really backed off the training, didn't go out on the road, only riding the home trainer, so I lost the feeling of being on the road. There was a lot of talk in the team about winning, having champagne and so on and I got drawn into that. I wouldn't say I was complacent, but the actual business of getting from A to B as fast as I could went out the window. The course in Strasbourg looks flat, but when you study it there are slight inclines and drags. Even so, we'll cover the four-and-a-half miles in less than nine minutes, probably about eight minutes 45 seconds for the fastest. That means travelling at about 35mph on the straights, and cornering at about 30mph. There are 10 corners and two roundabouts, but you go straight through them in big sweeping bends. With long straights it looks like the one in Lille in 1994 where Boardman won. I'm not going to think about the result. I'll just go and put in the best ride I can on the day. There are so many variables on the road compared to the track where everything can be calibrated. The prologue is one stage in the Tour where surprises happen - I'll never forget Boardman in 1998, when he thought he stood no chance, went to a Rolling Stones concert in Holland the week before then turned up and won. It will be a huge occasion for British cycling fans because for the first time ever there will be two Brits, David Millar and me, on the start ramp in the prologue as contenders. With the Tour start coming to London next year, it's great to have two guys who have a chance of winning it. It will be Dave's first race after his two-year drugs ban, but I wouldn't discount him. He thinks he can win it, and on past history the course should be right up his street. He won the prologue in 2000, came very very close in 2003 and has proved himself over plenty of time trials in the past. Once the prologue is over, I'd like to be able to get stuck into the Tour. That's the team plan anyway and it suits me. Our leader, David Moncoutie, is only just coming back from a knee injury and didn't finish the Dauphine so the whole team will be looking to get in breaks, pick up the King of the Mountains jersey for a couple of days and generally show our faces. I found the Dauphine tough, but there was no point where I thought I was going to blow out so I'd be gutted not to finish the Tour. It's a race you simply have to finish. Places in the Tour are priceless so I might only ever get one chance to ride and it's one of the few races you can look back on at the end of your career and be happy merely to have completed the course."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
