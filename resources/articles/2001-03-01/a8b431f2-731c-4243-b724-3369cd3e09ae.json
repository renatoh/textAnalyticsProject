You might as well call election now\", was the Sun's headline yesterday. Its front page proclaimed: \"Blair gets our support for a second term.\" On and on rolled the eulogy. (They do nothing by halves). \"Yesterday's budget was an astounding achievement.\" This conversion was no surprise. The Sun always rises to embrace power. Bullies the world over have just one rule - always join the winning side, don't be seen dead with the losers. This is another tombstone representing the collapse of the right. After two elections supporting Labour, the Sun can never again be the cornerstone of the old Conservative party. It recognises there is nothing there - no party (average age 66), no policies, no personalities, no purpose, no project. A very dead parrot, the final end of the Thatcher era. The nostrums and the diktats of her days were nowhere to be found in the Budget speech, finally purged and not before time. Labour has nothing left to fear from the past, no excuse now for future pusillanimity. Gallantly, the Sun tried hard to support William Hague but the faltering relationship is over, leaving an anguished Tory camp yesterday. The Sun front page Dear John letter had all the classic pathos of the but-let's-always-stay-friends, adding insult to injury. \"Truth is: the Tories are quite simply not ready. We respect William Hague... We gave him a chance. But, truly, we cannot endorse a Hague-Portillo team up against Blair-Brown. Who could? ... New Labour is not perfect. There is much to be done. And we will want results, Tony. We will demand them... But Blair has done enough to win our backing.\" Oh, good. Phew! That's it then. The election must be in the bag because the Sun says so and it will be \"the Sun wot won it\" yet again. They always do. The sheer brass neck, the conviction that they do actually run the country is comical, almost endearing in its illusion: it is one of their very few sincerely held beliefs. When journalists start believing they control the events they report, they have always lost the plot. Everyone sniggers. This portentous self-importance is just another common journalistic delusion of grandeur: given a platform and a bunch of students, journalists swashbuckle with the doughty sword of truth, boasting of the mighty brought low by fearless investigation, toiling in the dustbins of politics. However, most British journalists work for Murdoch, Black and Rothermere, for whom truth-seeking does not comes first. Frivolity and showmanship are rarely mentioned in earnest seminars. Nor the louche sneer and jeer that is the lingua franca. Nor the sheer joy of bullying anyone famous, kicking heads in for the hell of it. Power indeed. But psephologist Professor John Curtice takes a dusty view of the power of the press over voters in elections. Minimal, his research suggests. For all the bombast of newspaper opinionising, during the last election all that happened during the campaign was a 4% swing away from Labour to the Lib Dems, not advocated by any newspaper. Well, he says, at the margins the newspapers do bring in some voters. The Sun's switch to Labour at least stopped them recruiting Tories, but brought in no extra. A third of voters read no newspaper at all. Over the four years between elections, a third of readers swap papers, shifting cavalierly to a political opposite. The consumers of this declining industry are fickle and volatile. \"For marketing purposes, the Sun needed to keep up with its readers.\" Other suspicions lurk. Murdoch gives nothing for nothing. What's he after? It requires nothing so vulgar as a deal or even a word spoken - but the communications white paper's crucial section on media ownership is \"out for consultation\" until after the election. ON-digital is taking BSkyB to the Office of Fair Trading for abusing its monopoly control over sport and movies - the drivers of the digital future that can drive others out of business. Murdoch continues to lobby for the BBC to become a tiny public service broadcaster, its money dispersed among all broadcasters willing to do a bit of public service too. Murdoch has no views, only business interests that require him to be in arm-twisting reach of governments everywhere. However, venality apart, if the Sun is interesting, it is as a weather vane, acutely attuned to popular mood. On Wednesday it took a new astonishing line. It lambasted Hague's infamous \"Let me take you to a foreign country\" speech. The Sun leader said: \"Hague risked being called an extremist by banging on about immigration. This was imprudent... If an asylum seeker and his family is prepared to risk their lives to come here - might they not work hard? We're just asking - particularly as we need immigrants to boost our workforce... If they want to work, they should be allowed to stay. And Blair should be more prepared to argue that case.\" Hague's speech \"left a nasty taste in the mouth\". Perplexed cynics point out that Rupert Murdoch's new wife is a thirty-something who was born in China. Another interpretation might be that at last the multiculturalism of Britain, its diversity and plurality, has become so embedded in the national psyche, soap operas and comedy shows, that the Sun must follow. Inside Downing Street the Daily Mail used to be the bellwether. Its daily menu of anti-government stories - most of them breathtaking invention and distortion - frightened the life out of their pollster Philip Gould, who warned that private polling shows asylum seekers are a major concern to his focus groups. The Mail continues to belabour asylum seekers, but the Mail is in another business altogether from the Sun. Its arrogance is to believe that it is now Her Majesty's true opposition, there being no other. What it sells is a delusion of another kind. It offers a make-believe world where readers can amusingly delude themselves briefly. Come with the Mail and you enter a faraway country that is forever 1955, Noddy on the bookshelf, a comfy place where Mr and Mrs England with Janet and John would live happy ever after if it weren't for the scary gollywogs in the wood: a never ending tale of right v wrong. There are signs at last that the government is growing braver about the press. They can ignore both the Sun's boastful blandishments and the Mail's brickbats. There can rarely have been a lower moment in any leader's career than the craven anti-European article Tony Blair wrote in the Sun just before the last election, the quid pro quo for its support. There is no need to heed any of that any more. But there will be a need for bravery when it comes to facing the full blast of a 70% eurosceptic press in the euro referendum. Newspapers may not do much to change party allegiance, but Harvard research has shown how right across Europe a eurosceptic press has influenced opinion against the euro. The government has to win by sheer force of argument, but it will be a frightening and final \"who governs\" showdown with the press. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
