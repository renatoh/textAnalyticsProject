Downing Street rose to the defence of the Prime Minister's wife, arguing that she was in huge demand as a lawyer and human rights expert, and was regarded as an 'absolute gem' by the Olympic bid team, for whom she is an unpaid ambassador. The move followed reports yesterday that Blair had been suspended from taking paid engagements by senior civil service officials because of concerns about propriety. 'The suggestion that Downing Street or the Cabinet Office have said: \"in future you cannot do any of this\" - that's just not the way it works,' said a senior Downing Street source. Blair continues to be advertised as a guest speaker by the Harry Walker agency, which arranged the American interview, carried out during her husband's visit to the White House. Most of her engagements this month are likely to be uncontroversial, and unpaid. She opened the Roald Dahl museum in Buckinghamshire on Friday, and as an ambassador for the Olympic bid is likely to travel with her husband to Singapore for the final lobbying of IOC officials ahead of their decision on 6 July. But she is not ruling out further paid engagements. Chris Grayling, the shadow Leader of the Commons, wrote last week to John Hutton - the Cabinet Minister in charge of the civil service and the Ministerial code of propriety - questioning whether Blair should be made to submit to the same rules governing Ministers, preventing them exploiting their office for money. Hutton, however, simply referred the letter up to Downing Street. At present there are no rules governing the role of the Prime Ministerial spouse, although the Committee for Standards and Privileges in Public Life has been asked by Grayling to study the issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
