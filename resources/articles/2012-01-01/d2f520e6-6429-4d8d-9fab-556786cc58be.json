Sochaux's pursuit of Edu took an intriguing twist when one of the French club's directors claimed Rangers had urged them to make an improved bid for the American. McCoist has always said he wants Edu to stay at Ibrox. Asked if Edu was being offered to clubs without his knowledge, McCoist said: \"I obviously inquired about that and that's not the case. I've been told that's not the case and of course it can't be the case.\" Rangers have made a pre-contract offer to the St Johnstone striker Francisco Sandaza and are also in talks with the representative of the Swedish winger Mervan Celik. McCoist denied, though, that Fleetwood Town's Jamie Vardy was a target. \"No, not if they [Fleetwood] have knocked back \u00a3700,000 from Blackpool for a kid who is maybe not quite ready,\" said McCoist. \"Maybe if we were in a far better financial position he's somebody we could take a gamble on, have him here for six months and then bring him in. But we need someone who can play now.\" With Rangers desperate for new faces, McCoist said the spectre of a crucial tax tribunal which could force the club into administration is not hindering his recruitment process. That case is due to open again on Monday, although no result is expected for a number of weeks yet. \"I've have to say that the players we're going for at the moment, I'd hope the lure of the club would still be greater than any obvious concerns they might have,\" the manager added. \"I can totally understand the concerns anybody coming to the club could have but thankfully at the moment the people we're speaking to don't seem overly concerned and I don't mean that in a flippant way. \"There's nobody who has mentioned the tax case in any discussions we've had with any players or agents and that's the truth.\" The Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor will miss Saturday's visit to St Johnstone because of a thigh strain. Meanwhile the Celtic manager, Neil Lennon, has been named the Scottish Premier League's manager of the month for December, with his midfielder Victor Wanyama given the young player of the month award. Celtic won all five of their league matches in December without conceding a goal, a matter which saw them overhaul Rangers at the top of the SPL table."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
