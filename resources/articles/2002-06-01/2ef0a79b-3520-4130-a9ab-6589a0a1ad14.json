But my papers of choice are the Guardian, the Independent, the Observer and the Sunday Times. When I'm in the US, I try to get the New York Times and the New York Post. Magazines: I rarely buy them. We're decorating, so Elle Decoration has been all the rage. We've bought the London Evening Standard religiously for the style section. But it's years since I've bought a women's magazine. Books: A month ago, when I put my back out and had to spend several days in bed, I read Jack and Jackie: Portrait of an American Marriage by Christopher Andersen. It didn't tell me much that I didn't know, but it was a great read. TV: Working in the business, I try to watch as many news programmes as possible: all the traditional ones, BBC News at six o'clock, the ITV News, Channel 4 News, of course, and CNN and all the other rolling news networks. I also watch the US programmes - NBC News and CBS News. We cover more international news. Generally, I think there's little to watch. I have cable, with 40 channels, but I'm constantly surfing for something decent. I'm a fan of Frasier, Graham Norton and the Antiques Road Show and a recent convert to The West Wing. Radio: Radio 5 Live's Up All Night - it's a great mix of news, stories and interviews. Adverts: I tend to flip over or make a cup of tea when they come on. But I like the Sainsbury's ones with the Naked Chef, and the Barclays one, with the actor from Pulp Fiction. New media: I'm a huge, huge internet fan. I don't know how I managed without it. I'm working on a series of documentaries for PBS, and I've been using the internet for research - Nexus Lexus, the Economist online and the Guardian website. \u00b7 Former Channel 4 News and ITN world news presenter Daljit Dhaliwal is now joining CNN International."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
