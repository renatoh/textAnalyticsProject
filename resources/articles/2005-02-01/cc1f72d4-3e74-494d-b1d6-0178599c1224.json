A good old-fashioned British bucket-and-spade holiday is still hard to beat. Stay in a cosy cottage or a classic family-friendly hotel. Best of all, there's no jet lag. And plenty of cream teas. Favourite place to stay in the UK: The Luxury Family Hotels group (luxuryfamilyhotels.com) stands out because it focuses totally on the needs of families and does it with a much-needed touch of luxury for parents. The latest, the Ickworth Hotel (01284 735350, \u00a3200 per deluxe room - big enough for two adults and two kids - half-board) is also the grandest. Bedruthan Steps in Cornwall (01637 860555, bedruthan.com; from \u00a367 per adult, half-board, children \u00a311-\u00a344.89, depending on age, sharing a room) or Polmaily House near Loch Ness (01456 450343, polmaily.co.uk; a three-night package costs \u00a3565 half-board, including activities, for two adults and two children in a family suite) are also firm favourites. And abroad: La Casella, Umbria (0039 763 86684, lacasella.com, \u00a366 per adult, \u00a340 per child, peak season, half-board) has 32 rooms in four renovated farmhouses, spread over a 1,000 acre estate. There are plenty of activities including swimming and riding (for over 10s). Rome, Florence and Siena are day trip possibilities. Best family holiday ever: Egypt has everything. The sights perfect to calm teacher if you've taken them out of school. Plus a trip down the Nile on a felucca followed by a few days relaxing by the Red Sea. Not too far away. And not too expensive. What do you always take? Plenty of patience and a sense of humour. If that fails, the latest portable DVD plus a selection of hit movies. The new B\u00e9b\u00e9tel (a baby listener that links through to your mobile) is a clever addition if you have babies or toddlers. Top tip: Wrap little token presents for kids to open at hourly intervals on a long flight. Spend as little as possible but take as many as possible. It's indulgent, but when you're somewhere over Russia with seven hours to go, they're a godsend. Helen Truszkowski Consultant for the Take The Kids book series (Cadogan) and mother of George, 9 Favourite destination: The US for its high levels of service, dynamic attitude and friendliness. I favour NYC and New York State, southern Florida, the California coastline and Jackson Hole, Wyoming (my particular favourite family ski destination). Favourite place to stay in the UK: Beeson Farm Holiday Cottages (01548 581270, beesonhols.co.uk, from \u00a3225 per week for a two-bedroom cottage), on the edge of a quiet hamlet in south Devon, consists of five cosy cottages in recently refurbished Victorian barns and self-catering accommodation in a Georgian farmhouse. The owners employ a recycling policy, use energy-efficient appliances and have established a nature reserve. The farm sells its own organic fruit and vegetables, and there's a great beach a 12-minute amble away. And abroad: Nkwali safari lodge in the South Luangwa valley in Zambia (robinpope safaris.net; a seven-day trip with four nights in Robin's House at Nkwali, all flights, transfers, meals and game activities with a private guide costs \u00a31,191pp, through Sunvil Africa, 020-8232 9777, sunvil.co.uk/africa). This spot has superb game-viewing. The owners are especially welcoming to families, and tailor activities for kids, including trips to Kawaza school to meet local children. They also offer child minding. Best family holiday ever: Captiva Island, south-west Florida. It has beautiful white beaches, dolphins, self-hire boats to tiny islands such as Cabbage Key, mangrove canoe trips at Ding Darling Wildlife Refuge, bicycle hire and obscure little restaurants serving neon-pink cake and blue bubble-gum ice cream. What do you always take? A personal cassette player with pre-recorded story or music tapes always goes down well, as does dishing out a disposable camera for a kid's eye view of the trip. Top tip : The key to a successful kid's club holiday is asking plenty of questions before you book. These should include: What kind of supervised activities are there for my children's age group? What do they include? Do some activities or excursions cost extra? Are all your staff trained? (They should be at least l8 and have at least two years' experience working with children.) What happens at meal times? Can we drop in and out of club to suit our own daily schedule? Do you have a pool with a shallow end or separate toddler's pool? Are there lifeguards on duty? Is the pool enclosed? Debi Green Director of Babygoes2.com and mother of Roman, 6 Favourite destination: Sardinia, east coast around Cala Capra - just north of the Costa Smeralda. Turquoise water, unspoilt pink-tinged sandy beaches with rockpools, naturally shaded by pines, backed by steep maquis-covered cliffs. Excellent family-friendly restaurants and a wide variety of accommodation from simple self-catering apartments to luxury hotels. Boat trips to the Maddelena islands, various small towns close by. Favourite place to stay in the UK: Pennard Hill Farm, near Glastonbury (01749 890221, pennardhillfarm.co.uk, from \u00a350pp B&amp;B, in the main farmhouse, under fives free, cottages from \u00a3150 a night). Rooms in farmhouse or cottage sleeping 2-8. Stylish decor, very comfortable, indoor pool, huge gardens and great walks and views all around. Catering and babysitting if required. And abroad: Sani Asterias suites, Halkidiki Greece (saniresort.gr; from \u00a33,080 for seven nights' B&amp;B for a family of four, including flights, through ITC Classics, 01244 355527, itcclassics.co.uk). It has clean, sandy Blue Flag beaches with warm, clear, shallow water, stylish one-bedroom suites, Dr Haushka child suntan lotion, enclosed gardens leading to beach or pool, an open-air cinema, children's activities from four years up and a babe watch programme on the beach with up to 30 minutes' free babyminding. Best family holiday ever: Settlers Beach villa hotel, Barbados (001 246 422 3052, settlersbeachhotel.com; US$394 per night for a two-bedroom villa). Villas have kitchens and are set in gardens with a pool right on a quiet stretch of west coast beach. There's loads of space and flexibility thanks to the location plus great food, boat trips - my son swam with the turtles - babysitting and a very relaxed atmosphere. What do you always take? Activity packs, lucky dip, kites, anti-bacterial wipes, digital monitor, waterproof throwaway camera for each child, UV protective T-shirt, car window shades. Top tip: Take a flight survival pack for toddlers with small toys/things to do/treats. For older children take a waterproof disposable camera plus a scrapbook to make a holiday journal. Kate Calvert Editor of family-travel.co.uk and mother of Sarah, 9 and Conrad, 3 Favourite destination: Italy. Dedicated services for children are rare, but Italians tolerate any amount of bad behaviour from children. We've enjoyed agriturismi in Tuscany and Umbria but also Puglia, Sicily and more. With pizza and pasta the food is child friendly, and there are snippets of culture everywhere, so we parents get a bit of mental stimulation. Favourite place to stay in the UK: Hotel Tresanton in St Mawes, (01326 270055, tresanton.com, from \u00a3265 for a family suite, B&amp;B) which is child friendly while retaining a real sense of adult style. Among hotels dedicated to families, I'd pick Fowey Hall in Fowey (01726 833866, foweyhall.com, from \u00a3190 per room, half-board, children's meals extra) which has all the childcare stuff, lovely open fires, and Fowey itself to explore. For self-catering, Landmark Trust properties (01628 825925, landmarktrust.co.uk) are a great way of letting children experience history firsthand. And abroad: There are lots of agriturismi initiatives in Italy but at the organic Fattoria Il Cerreto in Tuscany (ilcerreto.it, apartments from \u20ac488 per week) there is even a bio swimming pool, and the family has four children of their own who play with all the visitors. The Touring Club of Italy publishes Agriturismo: The Guide To Farm Holidays In Italy, \u00a39.95. Best family holiday ever: Morocco - having a child with us humanised us to local people, and opened doors. Completely different but also real fun was a trip to Stockholm which is a lovely city that has thought carefully about how to cater for children. What do you always take? A nailbrush to scrub off clothing stains so we can pack light. Top tip: Find a book that tells the children something about the place they'll be visiting so they can experience that tick of recognition adults feel when they see famous places. The Madeline series by Ludwig Bemelmans (published by Scholastic) is good for little ones going to Paris; the Caroline Lawrence detective stories (The Roman Mysteries, Orion) for older children visiting Rome. \u00b7 All prices are low season unless stated"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
