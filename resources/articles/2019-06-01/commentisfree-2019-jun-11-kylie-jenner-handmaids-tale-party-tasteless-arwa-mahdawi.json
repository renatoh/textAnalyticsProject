The world may be a dismal place at the moment, but Kylie Jenner is here to remind us that there is a bright side to everything \u2013 even torture, rape and oppression. The 21-year-old reality TV star and cosmetics mogul recently had the bright idea of throwing a Handmaid\u2019s Tale-themed party for one of her BFFs. The book and TV show may be a downer, but, hey, the bright-red gowns look great on Instagram! Guests sipped \u201cpraise be vodka\u201d and \u201cunder his eye tequila\u201d cocktails while taking selfies \u2013 and completely missing the point of Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel. Jenner\u2019s bash, which she shared on social media (naturally), has prompted a backlash. It does seem remarkably tone-deaf to treat The Handmaid\u2019s Tale like a hilarious joke when the US is becoming more like the fictional Gilead by the day. If you think that is an overdramatic comparison, just take a look at Alabama, which recently became the latest state to pass an extreme abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. Not only does the bill force women to have their rapist\u2019s babies, but Alabama law means the rapist can get parental rights and sue for custody. Meanwhile, any doctor caught performing an abortion could get 99 years in prison. While I think we can agree that Jenner\u2019s party was in poor taste, getting outraged about it seems hypocritical. Is dressing up as a handmaid for fun really so much worse than watching the TV adaptation, which seems to revel in violence against women and has been described as \u201ctorture porn\u201d? I am not sure it is. In any case, there is not much use in getting outraged, considering that all publicity is good publicity for the Kardashian-Jenner clan. The attention Jenner\u2019s party garnered may even encourage her to stage a sequel. A glow-in-the-dark Chernobyl-themed party, perhaps? Got a feeling that might make the internet go nuclear. \u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
