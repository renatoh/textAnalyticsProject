But, as she sows her summer cabbages kneeling on a folded magazine, she says she feels more like an endangered species. \u201cYou hear about allotments going, up and down the country, so it\u2019s always a worry. There is such pressure on land, schools selling off their playing fields, and of course the councils must have an eye on allotments: it\u2019s prime space for housebuilding and we all know there is such a desperate need for houses, especially here in the south-east.\u201d Geraghty doesn\u2019t want me to say where the allotment is \u2013 on the south coast \u2013 because she is not registered for the plot but working it for her daughter, and the business of renting allotments is a deeply serious one. \u201cOh, I\u2019d hate to lose it if they didn\u2019t approve: the waiting lists are so long \u2013 years and years \u2013 and my daughter hasn\u2019t time really. She loves coming here when she can, but really it\u2019s mine now and I\u2019ve put so much into it. It feeds me and plenty more! They\u2019re very strict. There\u2019s always a beady eye on you because the waiting lists are so high, and everyone has a friend or a neighbour that\u2019s waiting for one. So it\u2019s zero tolerance if you\u2019re not dedicated and spick and span!\u201d There is a busy A-road just outside the entrance, but once inside the high metal gates \u2013 where the padlock codes are changed every month \u2013 the noise is of birdsong and squeaky wheelbarrows. The allotment holders have an association and a shop and the few people around greet each other warmly as they potter around in the spring sunshine. A middle-aged man wrestling with a new plastic water butt said: \u201cIt\u2019s like stress relief. I can\u2019t imagine life without it now. Who needs a gym membership?\u201d When gardener and former Observer columnist Monty Don called last week for an \u201callotment revival\u201d in the UK, he was speaking to the converted, feeding into a trend that is already expanding quickly. It has brought a spike in demand for allotments and already many councils have been cutting the size of the plots to squeeze in more enthusiasts. An estimated 350,000 people in Britain have allotments, with more than 800,000 on waiting lists. But as their popularity rises, the pressure on councils to release brownfield land for building is also increasing. Already two pressure groups have sprung up to help fight the trend, Save All Allotments and Don\u2019t Lose the Plot, alongside the work being done by the British Allotment Society, which takes several calls a week from worried gardeners who fear their little plot might be taken away. When the land is council-owned there is a statutory duty to find another site but it means starting again, often far away and in poorer soil, for many people who will have spent years building up plots and friendships. For private landowners there is only the duty to give a year\u2019s notice. Don, 59, is concerned that the arrival of generation rent, thanks to rocketing house prices and lack of space for new homes to be built with gardens, many people are not getting the opportunity to grow their own food. \u201cMy generation grew up expecting some sort of ownership and access to gardens. I had my first home aged 26 and started growing things then. My three kids are in their twenties and none of them rent or own homes with gardens. A generation is growing up with no access to green space. There\u2019s an increased remoteness about it all. Gardens can reach into life in a way that\u2019s beyond horticulture,\u2019 he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost so many of our allotments, and it\u2019s a tragedy. They\u2019re increasingly important as young people have less access to gardens. They\u2019re part of our way of life and we can\u2019t keep building on them.\u201d Before this week\u2019s Chelsea flower show, which Don is covering for the BBC, he said: \u201cCouncils are selling them off and say they\u2019ll find allotment space somewhere else, but this is missing the point. Allotments are supposed to be in the centre of things. They unite people of different ages, diverse backgrounds.\u201d For the past few years the grow-your-own trend has been spreading like Japanese knotweed. Even as DIY has waned as a hobby, gardening has exploded and sales of vegetable seeds are exceeding the sales of flower seeds in the UK for the first time since the second world war. Vegetables account for almost 80% of sales of seeds and plants compared to 30% in the 1990s. Even the pushed-for-space householder can buy tumbler tomatoes or alpine strawberries that can grow down from a hanging basket. And the Incredible Edible project at Todmorden in Yorkshire inspired other towns when residents began pulling out the ornamental shrubs in public places and replacing them with herbs, vegetables and fruit trees. There has been a huge surge, too, of people scavenging parks, woods and hedgerows for wild edible plants such as garlic, elderflower and berries. \u201cThey\u2019re about community, communication, producing food and doing it alongside each other,\u201d said Don. \u201cThey\u2019re a paradigm of a successful society. We should treasure them. There\u2019s a mental and social factor to be taken into account when urban people have no access to gardens.\u201d His plea comes at a time when several sites are under threat. Sara Jane Trebar from Farm Terrace allotments in Watford, Hertfordshire, has been among those fighting since 2009 to stop her local authority handing over the site to builders of 68 houses and a car park for Watford football club. The case has been in and out of court and the office of the secretary of state for local government. Last October the allotment holders thought they had won a landmark victory to overturn the decision by Eric Pickles, then secretary of state, in favour of the council, but they have just found out that Watford borough council is to appeal again. \u201cThere\u2019s so much pressure to build, build, build,\u201d said Trebar. \u201cOur allotments have been here since 1896. It\u2019s been harrowing that just as we\u2019re seeing this green surge, with people wanting to grow things in their own space, that local authorities are starting to get rid of them. It\u2019s happening more and more to people. It\u2019s very sad, especially at a time when food banks are at an all-time high.\u201d A freedom of information request by the Save All Allotments campaigners found that, between 2007 and 2014, 194 out of 198 applications to close allotments were granted by the secretary of state. The Department for Communities and Local Government has said that 2,000 new allotment places were created in the past few years but has no figures for how many have been lost. Di Appleyard of the National Allotment Society said that, as people are ending up with smaller and smaller gardens, allotments have never been more vital. \u201cThey are wonderful for mental health, for creating community, but there is a problem in that it\u2019s the right to grow that is protected by statute, so if a council wants a bit of land it really doesn\u2019t have to take account of the community there. \u201cBut a lot of councils are respecting their allotments and not trying to get rid of them despite the pressures,\u201d she said. She added that the once traditional \u201callotment officer\u201d post was mostly disappearing, leaving many allotments unmanaged, while other councils were raising rents. \u201cAllotments are of course vulnerable with the pressure on urban space increasing,\u201d Appleyard said. \u201cBut there are ways to fight back and things people can do. People power is an impressive thing.\u201d GROW YOUR OWN \u25a0 During the Dig for Victory days of the 1940s, Britain had 1.5m allotments. \u25a0 The austere years of the 1970s saw another surge of grow-your-own. \u25a0 Beans are said to be the most popular homegrown vegetables, while about 10% of strawberries and raspberries are homegrown, along with 7% of potatoes. \u25a0 In 1908 the Small Holdings and Allotments Act placed a duty on local authorities to provide sufficient allotments, according to demand. The rights of allotmenteers in England and Wales were strengthened with the Allotments Act of 1925, which established statutory allotments that local authorities could not sell without ministerial consent. \u25a0 Thirty minutes of allotment gardening burns about 150 calories, the same as low-impact aerobics, according to the British Allotment Society. \u25a0 An allotment is traditionally measured in \u201crods\u201d or \u201cpoles\u201d, a measurement from Anglo-Saxon times. Ten poles is the accepted size of a plot, equal to 250 square metres. Recent \u201cplot chopping\u201d by councils to accommodate rising demand has been controversial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
