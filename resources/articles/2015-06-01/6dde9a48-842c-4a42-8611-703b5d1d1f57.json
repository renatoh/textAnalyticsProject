The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) is launching a judicial review of the tender, alleging that the department has no legal power to carry out the activity. The existence of the MoJ\u2019s commercial body, Just Solutions International (JSI), was revealed earlier this year but little is known about its purpose or operations. Lawyers for GCHR allege that competing for profit-making contracts for consultancy services overseas is not a \u201cgovernmental purpose\u201d. Other than raising revenue for the MoJ, the organisation argues, JSI\u2019s aims are not of public benefit and therefore it is \u201cultra vires\u201d, or beyond the powers, of ministers to operate such a scheme. The MoJ has so far declined to release detailed information about the deal. Saudi Arabia has been widely criticised for its human rights record. There has been an international outcry over the case of Raif Badawi, who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and 1,000 lashes for advocating freedom of expression online. Melanie Gingell of GCHR stated: \u201cBy providing services to the Saudi prison and probation service the UK is lending legitimacy and indirectly supporting such abuses. \u201cIt is hypocritical of the government to publicly condemn barbarity such as is meted out to Raif Badawi, while at the same time implicitly condoning such activities by bidding to provide services on a commercial basis to those who perpetrate the abuses. \u201d Adam Hundt, of the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn Solicitors which is acting for GCHR, said: \u201cIt is surprising that JSI\u2019s activities have taken place shrouded in secrecy, and without parliamentary debate or approval. \u201cIf the UK is to sell its public services to regimes that behead people for sorcery, stone women to death and flog people for expressing pro-democracy views, then one would expect parliament to be consulted and given the opportunity to impose appropriate parameters on such activities.\u201d Because of restrictions to judicial review, GCHR is seeking to crowdfund its legal challenge. According to MoJ reports, JSI has recently won a contract to provide services to Macedonia and has put in a bid to advise on new prison in Oman. An MoJ spokesperson said: \u201cWe have not signed any contract with the Saudi government, or sold any services to them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
