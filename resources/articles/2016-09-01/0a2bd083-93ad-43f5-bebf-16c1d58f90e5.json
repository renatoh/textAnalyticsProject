Among Dustin Moskovitz\u2019s aims is electing Hillary Clinton, whom he apparently has never met, president. Moskovitz was college roommates with Mark Zuckerberg and just became, it looks like, the third-biggest Democratic donor out there. In a statement on Medium, Moskovitz and his wife, whose cool name is Cari Tuna, and who together are noted and precocious philanthropists, said they feel hesitant to try to buy elections but the \u201cfear and hostility\u201d with which the Republicans have conducted this campaign has compelled them to act. Bill Clinton, the Arkansas native and former governor who won Appalachia and Georgia at Carter \u201976 levels, has said that Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cmake America great again\u201d is racist dog whistling: \u201cThat message \u2013 I\u2019ll give you America great again \u2013 if you\u2019re a white southerner, you know exactly what it means, don\u2019t you?\u201d Clinton said to an audience in Orlando: It means I\u2019ll give you the economy you had 50 years ago and I\u2019ll move you back up the social totem pole and other people down,. What Hillary wants to do is take the totem pole down and let us all go forward together! Texas Representative Louie Gohmert, who came to Washington playing the Tea Party piccolo, and who has a reputation for saying all kinds of crazy stuff about \u201cterror babies\u201d and Muslim Brotherhood members in the White House and death squads and asparagus, has said further crazy things about Hillary Clinton, this time to attendees of a values voters summit in Washington, DC, where Donald Trump is scheduled to appear later today. \u201cYou don\u2019t make fun of people who are impaired, have special needs,\u201d Gohmert, a Republican, said. Who was the top recipient of funds from Donald Trump\u2019s charitable foundation in 2014? Would you believe an activist group suing the New York attorney general who was suing Trump University for fraud? It appears that Trump gave $100,000, as charity, to an effort to take down a public official accusing him of fraud. The man who ran the activist group now works on the Trump campaign. The revelation, reported by Yahoo, comes as questions build about a separate donation the Trump charity made to the Florida attorney general\u2019s reelection effort in 2013. Reelecting attorneys general, or bringing federal lawsuits against them, does not count as charitable activity. One year after Trump was booed at the Values Voters Summit for calling Marco Rubio \u201ca clown,\u201d the Republican nominee gave a more polished speech where he ignored politically divisive issues like abortion and same-sex marriage and instead focused on school vouchers and changing federal law to allow tax exempt churches to engage in political advocacy. To Trump, school choice, which he advocated for in a speech on Thursday was a needed innovation. \u201cThe education can\u2019t get worse,\u201d he said as Trump also pledged to \u201ccampaign to get the states to re-allocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has released 10 years of running mate Mike Pence\u2019s tax returns, covering the years 2006 through 2015, despite having not released any tax information of the presidential candidate himself. The Indiana governor\u2019s latest tax filings show that he paid an effective tax rate of 12.4% on an income of $113,026 in 2015, the second-lowest tax rate of the past decade for the governor and his family. In 2015, Pence made a total of $8,923 in donations to charity, almost equal to the $8,956 he paid in federal income tax. \u201cThe Pence family has been honored to serve their state and their nation for the past 16 years, while raising three great children and putting them through college,\u201d Marc Lotter, Pence\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement. \u201cThese tax returns clearly show that Mike and Karen Pence have paid their taxes, supported worthy causes, and, unlike the Clintons, the Pences have not profited from their years in public service.\u201d Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has released her 2015 personal tax return in August, as well as that of running mate Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, who additionally released 10 years of their returns. Those figures showed that Hillary and Bill Clinton earned nearly $11m in 2015, paying an effective federal income tax rate of 34.2%. Adding an effective state and local income tax rate of 9.0%, the couple\u2019s total tax rate totaled 43.2%. The Clintons donated $1,042,000, or 9.8%, of their adjusted gross income to charity. Also revealed in the latest tax filings is Karen Pence\u2019s unsuccessful stint as a small business owner: That\u2019s My Towel Charm, Inc., which sold towel charms so that bathers do not confuse their towels, lost $3,407 last year. Practice may not make perfect for Donald Trump, but the Republican nominee clearly has refined his appeal to evangelical voters in the past year. One year after Trump was booed at the Values Voters Summit for calling Marco Rubio \u201ca clown,\u201d the Republican nominee gave a more polished speech where he ignored politically divisive issues like abortion and same-sex marriage and instead focused on school vouchers and changing federal law to allow tax exempt churches to engage in political advocacy. To Trump, school choice, which he advocated for in a speech on Thursday was a needed innovation. \u201cThe education can\u2019t get worse,\u201d he said as Trump also pledged to \u201ccampaign to get the states to re-allocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs\u201d Speaking from teleprompters, it served as a pointed contrast to his speech a year ago which seemed to focus on the importance of saying \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d instead of \u201cHappy Holidays.\u201d Trump still was by no means a natural in front of a crowd of ardent social conservatives. He referred to attendees as \u201cyou people\u201d at one point. Trump also railed against the Obama administration for not admitting Christian refugees from Syria into the United States, a major cause of concern for evangelicals who have long advocated for minority Christian communities in the Middle East. The problem is that Trump\u2019s own refugee policy would be a blanket ban on anyone from the region entering the United States. He did seem cognizant that no one would mistake him for a devout evangelical. At one point in the speech he joked that his support for repealing the Johnson Amendment, which would allow churches to engage in partisan politics while keeping their tax exempt status, was the only way he could get into heaven. But the biggest applause was not for Trump himself but for when he proclaimed \u201cHillary Clinton is unfit to be president.\u201d The room exploded in applause and one attendee could be seen waving his tricorn hat in support. Values Voter Summit is sponsored by the Family Research Council and has a constellation of conservative groups represented. Even the far-right John Birch Society had a table in the group\u2019s exhibition hall. But Trump\u2019s performance seemed to ease the concerns of attendees who represented some of the most ardent cultural warriors in the party, a group that has long been uncomfortable with the nominee and preferred other candidates like Ted Cruz in the primary. Dylan Miller, a rising community college freshman from Northwest Florida said the speech changed his mind about Trump. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem maniacal\u201d said the teenager, in contrast to the Republican nominee\u2019s performances on television. Miller had said he had always planned on voting for Trump \u201cbecause he wasn\u2019t Hillary,\u201d but Trump\u2019s performance made him feel far more comfortable with his vote. Another attendee, Sarah Ocker, a student at Tulsa Community College in Oklahoma, said she was \u201cmore there\u201d now than she was before the speech. She \u201cagreed with a lot\u201d of what Trump said, particularly about \u201creligious liberty.\u201d Ocker still had major hesitations about Trump and still couldn\u2019t commit to voting for the Republican nominee though but was \u201choping\u201d she could find a reason to vote for him in November. Vernon Lewis of Marshall, Texas was further along in the process. Lewis had once thought he would have to hold his nose to vote for Trump. But after a private meeting with other Christians with Trump in New York as well as seeing his speech Friday, Lewis was enthusiastic. \u201cHe is a very gentle guy.\u201d On Friday, in blazing sunshine, about 200 members of Congress stood on the steps beneath the recently restored Capitol dome and prayed, observed a moment\u2019s silence and, accompanied by a marine band, sang God Bless America to mark the imminent anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The remembrance ceremony, with Democrats and Republicans standing side by side, was heartening to Emanuel Lipscomb, 57, who was in New York on business that day and narrowly survived the disaster. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see it\u2019s brought a spark of bipartisanship,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing the United States together because we all suffered together as one.\u201d For these crisp nine minutes, at least, the toxic wrangling and inertia of Congress could be put aside, along with its legacy of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. TheHouse speaker, Paul Ryan, who was 31 on 9/11, reflected on a generation of teenagers who have no memory of it. \u201cToday, I can\u2019t help but think of my own children \u2013 and all the children born after 9/11,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cDo they fully understand what happened that day? Will they ever? Can they? They can watch the old footage. They can see clips of the towers falling. They can hear the great roar as a landmark comes crashing down \u2013and with it, an era. But can they actually feel it? \u201cI\u2019ve had so many conversations with my own kids about this, about the shock, the terror, the outrage. Can they feel the sense of bereavement \u2013 at losing almost 3,000 Americans in a single morning? I don\u2019t think they can. But that makes it our generation\u2019s burden. We lived through that terrible day. And we will never forget that terrible day.\u201d Ryan spoke of the firefighters who rushed into danger and the flags that appeared on overpasses as if \u201cto bind up the nation\u2019s wounds\u201d. He added: \u201cThese are the stories that we can pass on. We can turn our burden of grief into a gift of grace \u2013 because our children may not fully understand the horror of it all. But they can admire the heroism.\u201d Having a newly discovered parasitic flatworm named after you may not be the world\u2019s most illustrious honor, but it\u2019s something Barack Obama nonetheless has the pleasure of adding to his presidential legacy. Enter Baracktrema obamai, the flatworm that infects Malaysian freshwater turtles, a species and genus of parasite discovered by Dr Thomas R Platt, an expert on turtle parasites, who wanted to bestow the president with a gift of adding his namesake to the animal kingdom. \u201cThis is clearly something in my small way done to honor our president,\u201d Platt, who recently discovered that he was also a distant relative of Obama, told the Associated Press. \u201cI have named a number of species after people I admire, from my father-in-law, my PhD adviser, and good friends who are academics and/or amateur naturalists,\u201d Platt said in a press release. \u201cBaracktrema obamai will endure as long as there are systematists studying these remarkable organisms.\u201d Senator John McCain gave Donald Trump\u2019s military credibility a wide berth during an appearance at the Heritage Foundation, a Thatcherite free market think tank in Washington. After delivering a speech about America\u2019s role in Asia, McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008, was asked about Trump\u2019s recent appearance in a televised \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d forum. At first he offered his usual reply: \u201cI support the nominee of the party.\u201d After a pause, perhaps considering this will no longer suffice, McCain added: \u201cHonestly, I am not here to talk about Donald Trump. The election will be in November. The issues we\u2019re discussing today will be with us for a long time.\u201d Those issues included Chinese aggression in Asia which, the Arizona senator argued, must be opposed through military strength and free trade, in particular the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have vowed to scrap the deal. But McCain warned: \u201cIf TPP fails, American leadership in the Asian Pacific may well fail with it.\u201d He contended that not passing the TPP would mean China \u201crewrites the rules at our expense\u201d. The former prisoner of war in Vietnam also lambasted Barack Obama\u2019s handling of the crisis in Syria, claiming that president\u2019s failure to enforce the \u201cred line\u201d over using chemical weapons \u201cdestroyed\u201d American credibility in the region and around the world. The chair of NBC News has emailed the network\u2019s staffers to congratulate Matt Lauer on a job well-done during this week\u2019s \u201cCommander-in-Chief\u201d forum aboard the aircraft carrier Intrepid, despite wide criticism of Lauer\u2019s performance as the forum\u2019s moderator. Andy Lack, the head of NBC News, emailed Lauer\u2019s colleagues that \u201cMatt did a tremendous job \u2013 driving one of the most serious discussions to date on these topics,\u201d despite criticism of the TODAY Show host for spending more than a third of his time with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on her use of private email servers and declining to fact-check Donald Trump\u2019s incorrect assertion that he was opposed to the invasion of Iraq. The email, obtained by the Guardian, called the forum a \u201cremarkable achievement\u201d. Here\u2019s the letter in full: Dear Colleagues, Before this week comes to an end, I wanted to take just a moment to share how proud I am of all the work our teams produced together this week. After a summer of success at the Conventions and the Olympics, we broke more new ground Wednesday night with the first ever Commander-in-Chief Forum. Against all odds we were able to bring the two presidential nominees together for the first time and presented an important examination of what each would bring to the role of Commander-in-Chief. Because of our event, national security has dominated the news cycle for days. Every major paper and news broadcast around the world has led with headlines about Putin, Iraq, ISIS, and intelligence briefings. Matt did a tremendous job \u2013 driving one of the most serious discussions to date on these topics. Nearly 15 million people watched the event, and over 26 million tuned in at some point during the hour. My deepest thanks to everyone who helped pull off this remarkable achievement. Have a wonderful weekend! With much respect and affection, Andy This is Hillel the Elder, not Emma Watson. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has promised to reveal his full health records, but that promise - made after questions were raised about a letter penned by his gastroenterologist in just five minutes while a Trump limousine idled outside his office - has been moderated to entail a one-hour sitdown interview on The Dr. Oz Show\u2019s season premiere next week. Trump will appear on the show - hosted by the eponymous Dr. Mehmet Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon and Columbia University professor - with daughter Ivanka Trump to \u201creveal his own personal health regimen,\u201d as well as address \u201cwhy the health of the candidates has become such a serious issue in this campaign,\u201d according to a teaser for the interview released by the show. Oz himself has been criticized by fellow doctors on the grounds that he promotes \u201cquack treatments\u201d and \u201chas repeatedly shown disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops\u201d. The episode will air on 15 September, next Thursday. \u201cThe next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others. We could even end up with a total of five judges,\u201d Donald Trump said at the Value Voters Summit of Christian conservatives in Washington, DC. \u201cAnd you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to pick great judges,\u201d he continued. \u201cMaybe we use Judge Scalia as the ultimate example of what we\u2019re looking for, okay? This will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic, frankly.\u201d \u201cThe extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public,\u201d Trump said. Donald Trump, on allowing tax-exempt churches to endorse politicians: I figure, it\u2019s the only way I\u2019m getting to heaven. \u201cOur politicians have really abandoned you, to a large extent. And Hillary Clinton? You can forget about her.\u201d \u201cIn Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended like you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBelieve me.\u201d \u201cAnd that includes religious liberty - remember,\u201d Trump added, a winking reference to so-called \u201creligious freedom\u201d bills that would allow Christian business owners to refuse service to those whose lifestyles, marriage statuses or sexual orientations ran counter to their religious beliefs. \u201cOur nation today is divided,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNobody likes to say it, but we\u2019re living in a very, very divided nation,\u201d which will be brought to unity only through \u201cour faith in God.\u201d Speaking at the Value Voters Summit in Washington, DC, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told the audience of Christian conservatives thanked host Tony Perkins for his \u201cyears of leadership\u201d at the Family Research Council. Trump was introduced by actor Jon Voight, who lambasted Hillary Clinton and professional football player Colin Kaepernick before announcing that \u201cif God allows truth to be said and heard, then we will see Donald Trump the president of this great America.\u201d \u201cThe support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible,\u201d Trump said of evangelical voters, who helped him to victory in the South Carolina Republican primary. \u201cI\u2019m gonna make it up to you, too - you watch!\u201d Telling the audience that there are \u201cno more decent or devoted people\u201d in the country than evangelical Christians, Trump told the audience of religious activists that despite mockery from \u201cour media culture,\u201d their values \u201cbuilt this nation.\u201d Watch it live here: With T-minus thirty minutes until Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is expected to take the stage at the Value Voters Summit - basically the Christian Right\u2019s version of the Gathering of the Juggalos, except instead of turning over cars they call for the criminalization of homosexuality - let\u2019s turn back the clock to September 2015, when Trump was speaking to a much more skeptical audience... Trump, a thrice-married New York billionaire fond of high society and lavish living, has to appeal to the social conservatives who make up the GOP\u2019s base. This does not come naturally. The unsteady nature of this awkward, fumbling relationship was made clear at the Values Voter Summit in Washington. On Friday, Trump brandished his Sunday school Bible at a crowd of thousands in a subterranean hotel ballroom. It was clear why he has yet to be embraced as the candidate of the religious right. In a speech which prompted his first boos from a conservative audience \u2013 because he called fellow candidate Marco Rubio \u201ca clown\u201d \u2013 Trump tried to appeal to social conservatives. It didn\u2019t work. In front of an ardently anti-abortion crowd, his only reference to babies was as a description of establishment Republicans. He also left same-sex marriage unmentioned, hours before Kim Davis was scheduled to accept a \u201cCost of Discipleship award\u201d. A county clerk from rural Kentucky, Davis refused to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples, a decision for which she was jailed. Aside from the context-less statement \u201cfreedom of religion, so important\u201d, Trump\u2019s pitch was to cast himself as a frontline fighter in the war against Christmas. \u201cThe word \u2018Christmas\u2019 \u2013 I love Christmas,\u201d Trump said, repeating: \u201cI love Christmas. \u201cYou go to stores now, you don\u2019t see the word \u2018Christmas\u2019. It says \u2018Happy Holidays\u2019 all over. I say, \u2018Where\u2019s Christmas?\u2019 I tell my wife: \u2018Don\u2019t go to those stores. I want to see Christmas. No, I want to see Christmas.\u2019 And you know, other people can have their holidays, no. But Christmas is Christmas. I want to see \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019.\u201d Trump pledged: \u201cYou\u2019re going to see it if I get elected, I can tell you right now.\u201d A new Trump ad \u2013 not a phrase we find ourselves typing too frequently \u2013 says Hillary Clinton is failing veterans but that would not be the case if Trump were president. Here\u2019s a transcript of the voiceover: In Hillary Clinton\u2019s America, veterans are left behind, kept on long wait lists at VA hospitals, only to get second-rate medical care. It\u2019s more of the same but worse. Donald Trump\u2019s America will be great again and will be respected by all. Veterans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. The VA reformed. Our soldiers treated like heroes. Change that makes America great again. Donald Trump for president. Trump leads Clinton by 19 points among active military and military veterans, according to polling published this week. That sounds pretty good but not so much when you consider May 2012 polling showing Mitt Romney leading Barack Obama among vets by 24 points. Who was the top recipient of funds from Donald Trump\u2019s charitable foundation in 2014? Would you believe an activist group suing the New York attorney general who was suing Trump University for fraud? It appears that Trump gave $100,000, as charity, to an effort to take down a public official accusing him of fraud. The man who ran the activist group now works on the Trump campaign. The revelation, reported by Yahoo, comes as questions build about a separate donation the Trump charity made to the Florida attorney general\u2019s reelection effort in 2013. Reelecting attorneys general, or bringing federal lawsuits against them, does not count as charitable activity. Michael Isikoff writes: The size and timing of the donation to the Citizens United Foundation, an arm of the sprawling conservative network run by David Bossie, who is now Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager, could raise fresh questions about whether Trump has used his tax-exempt charity to further political and personal causes. [...] While the donation to Bossie\u2019s group has been mentioned in some media accounts, what has gone unnoticed until now is a major project of Citizens United at the time: a lawsuit it filed that year \u2014 since dismissed by a federal judge \u2014 against [NY state attorney general Eric] Schneiderman, New York\u2019s Democratic attorney general, over his efforts to require nonprofit groups such as Citizens United to disclose the identity of their donors under seal to the New York State Charities Bureau. Schneiderman by then had become a major political nemesis of Trump... The Trump campaign has released a statement calling North Korea\u2019s nuclear test \u201cone more example of Hillary Clinton\u2019s catastrophic failures as secretary of state\u201d: North Korea has continued development of its nuclear weapons program despite steadily tightening sanctions by the US and allies and increasing global isolation. Trump has said he would get China to fix the problem. That\u2019s not a summarizing of his position, that\u2019s it. This morning his campaign manager said he had a secret plan they can\u2019t disclose. Texas Representative Louie Gohmert, who came to Washington playing the Tea Party piccolo, and who has a reputation for saying all kinds of crazy stuff about \u201cterror babies\u201d and Muslim Brotherhood members in the White House and death squads and asparagus, has said further crazy things about Hillary Clinton, this time to attendees of a values voters summit in Washington, DC, where Donald Trump is scheduled to appear later today. \u201cYou don\u2019t make fun of people who are impaired, have special needs,\u201d Gohmert, a Republican, said, continuing: And whether you like it or not, Hillary Clinton has made clear she is mentally impaired. I get the impression that in law school and along the way she\u2019s been very, very smart but i don\u2019t know maybe it was the concussion, the fall back that she did. Or who knows, they won\u2019t tell us what\u2019s really going on with her. We need to be praying for Hillary Clinton. There\u2019s special needs there. There\u2019s mental impairment. Louie Gohmert is \u2013 well we\u2019re not about name-calling here \u2013 for example Louie Gohmert is too peripheral a figure to make senator John McCain\u2019s shortlist of \u201cwacko birds.\u201d \u201cAnderson, you\u2019re better than this!\u201d How\u2019s that Senate takeover going for you, Democrats? The Democrats need to nab at least four seats from Republicans, and elect Hillary Clinton president, to gain control of the senate next year, plus retain the seat held by retiring minority leader Harry Reid in Nevada, which is not a no-brainer. The way it\u2019s supposed to work for the Democrats is for Democratic senate candidates to win in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and then maybe North Carolina or Pennsylvania or Florida. (Or maybe John McCain will lose in Arizona?) (Republican incumbent Rob Portman in Ohio has been posting impressive poll numbers.) New Quinnipiac numbers make the Republicans look pretty good in four of those races: Also: BuzzFeed\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski points out that Trump is running quite a ways behind down-ticket Republicans in the four states. What if the Republicans had nominated someone else for president? In compliance with a FOIA request by Politico, the Clinton presidential library has released photos of then-president Bill Clinton hanging out with Donald Trump at the 2000 US Open tennis tournament in Queens and at Trump Tower for a fundraiser. They look like pals. In one image, Clinton stands with his arm around then-Trump-girlfriend Melania Knauss, with Trump next to him with his arm around an unidentified woman wearing a Playboy T-shirt. Politico: The 22 images were taken by official White House photographers in June 2000 during a visit the president paid to Trump Tower in New York City for a political fundraiser, and in September 2000 during the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Flushing Meadows, N.Y. [...] \u201cI didn\u2019t know him that well,\u201d Clinton said last year. \u201cI mean, I knew him. I knew him and I happened to be planning to be in Florida and I thought it\u2019d be fun to go to his wedding, because it\u2019s always entertaining.\u201d Read further. Here\u2019s some fresh Hillary Clinton propaganda which we have to call that because it\u2019s touching and human in a way that threatens the carapace of cynicism without which one might fear for one\u2019s survival in this particular election year. Here\u2019s what Clinton\u2019s communications director would like you to take away from the viewing experience: NB we are ready to post the concomitant fresh Trump propaganda, for the appraisal of you the reader, as soon as it crosses our transom. Bill Clinton, the Arkansas native and former governor who won Appalachia and Georgia at Carter \u201976 levels, has said that Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cmake America great again\u201d is racist dog whistling: \u201cThat message \u2013 I\u2019ll give you America great again \u2013 if you\u2019re a white southerner, you know exactly what it means, don\u2019t you?\u201d Clinton said to an audience in Orlando Thursday: It means I\u2019ll give you the economy you had 50 years ago and I\u2019ll move you back up the social totem pole and other people down,. What Hillary wants to do is take the totem pole down and let us all go forward together! Watch the video on the Real Clear Politics site. North Carolina, whose 15 electoral votes are up for grabs, is already sending out absentee ballots to voters who\u2019ve requested them. University of Florida professor Michael McDonald tracks early voting: That\u2019s a lot more ballots sent out early than in 2012, but McDonald warns against jumping to conclusions based on those figures: Thirty-six states plus Washington, DC, have some form of early voting, which is becoming more popular; about one in three ballots this year are expected to be cast early. A new Hillary Clinton campaign ad rebuts Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that he alone can fix all that\u2019s gone wrong with America. If you don\u2019t remember Trump creepily saying that, it might be time to relive the climactic moment of the Republican national convention. In Clinton\u2019s new ad, she says, \u201cDonald Trump says he alone can fix the problems we face. Well I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s how you get things done in our country.\u201d She lists solutions achieved through cooperation including health care for kids, the rebuilding of New York City after 9/11 and arms agreements with Russia. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring people together. That\u2019s how you solve problems, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do, as president,\u201d she concludes. A co-founder of Facebook said to be worth around $10bn (50 times more than Donald Trump? 100 times more?) has just announced donations to multiple Democratic groups. Among Dustin Moskovitz\u2019s aims is electing Hillary Clinton, whom he apparently has never met, president. Moskovitz was college roommates with Mark Zuckerberg and just became, it looks like, the third-biggest Democratic donor out there. In a statement on Medium, Moskovitz and his wife, whose cool name is Cari Tuna, and who together are noted and precocious philanthropists, said they feel hesitant to try to buy elections but the \u201cfear and hostility\u201d with which the Republicans have conducted this campaign has compelled them to act: This decision was not easy, particularly because we have reservations about anyone using large amounts of money to influence elections. We hope these efforts make it a little more likely that Secretary Clinton is able to pursue the agenda she\u2019s outlined, and serve as a signal to the Republican Party that by running this kind of campaign \u2014 one built on fear and hostility \u2014 and supporting this kind of candidate, they compel people to act in response. It\u2019s the question everyone in US politics is trying to answer right now: who\u2019s better, Obama or Putin? Donald Trump\u2019s daring to say Putin, a notion elected Republicans won\u2019t touch with a ten-foot pole, has given cover for other closet admirers of the Russian strongman to come out of the closet. Indiana governor / Trump No. 2 Mike Pence, for example, told CNN Thursday evening that of course Putin is a stronger leader than Obama: I think it\u2019s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that\u2019s going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president Noted conservative talk show Hugh Hewitt serves up this analysis: Former Obamanistas and sympathetic progressives are arguing with Hewitt about it: Putin\u2019s not the only controversial entry on Hewitt\u2019s top-leaders list: Update: for further reading: Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Donald Trump has done a call-in interview for Russian propaganda outlet RT, which used to stand for Russia Today, slamming the US media and criticizing US foreign policy. In Trump\u2019s defense, the interview was with eternal TV host Larry King, an old Trump pal and probably not a fifth columnist. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s untiring admiration for Russia \u2013 which Hillary Clinton yesterday called \u201cscary\u201d, \u201cdangerous\u201d, \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201castonishing\u201d \u2013 threatens to become a political liability, as he is running for president of the USA. Here\u2019s the interview: The Trump campaign explained that Trump did not know whom he was doing the interview with. Trump\u2019s coziness with the Russians is making Republican lawmakers nervous, as CNN\u2019s Manu Raju demonstrates: Trump\u2019s interview with Russian TV aired as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange went on Fox News to tell host Sean Hannity that the organization is working \u201caround the clock\u201d to prepare documents relating to Clinton\u2019s campaign for release. In July, WikiLeaks published internal Democratic emails obtained through hacking in which Moscow figures as a prime suspect. Elsewhere, Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman reports that the man at the center of the US Senate\u2019s landmark investigation of the CIA torture program has gone public for the first time about an experience that led to the CIA spying on him as part of what he calls a \u201cfailed coverup\u201d: For six years, Daniel Jones was the chief investigator for the Senate intelligence committee\u2019s inquiry into CIA detentions and interrogations carried out in the post-9/11 Bush era. Jones and his team turned 6.3m pages of internal CIA documents into a scathing study which concluded that torture was ineffective and that the CIA had lied about it to two presidents, Congress and the US public. But before Jones\u2019s investigation was released in December 2014, the CIA searched through Senate files on a shared, firewalled network which had been set up by the agency for Jones and his team to securely receive classified documents. The CIA accessed Jones\u2019s work and even reconstructed his emails, sparking an unprecedented clash between the agency and its legislative overseers on Capitol Hill.
