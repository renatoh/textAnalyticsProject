The usual greeting when you meet someone on a country road or track is \"Mir\u00eb jeni?\" (\"Are you well?\", pronounced \"Meer Yenni?\"). In rural areas, food and bottled water can be found in villages on main roads, where there are also small roadside restaurants. Smaller villages away from tarmac roads sometimes have shops selling unpredictable types of food and soft drinks but almost never water. A fine area for walkers who like hills and not just mountains is Mallakast\u00ebr, in the triangle between the towns of Fier, Berat and Tepelen\u00eb. But unless you are camping, it might be difficult to find somewhere to sleep (there is currently no hotel operating on the 80km stretch of the north-south highway between Fier and Tepelen\u00eb).
