Alex Dombrandt must also take plenty of credit \u2013 he excelled on his return from injury and scored what ultimately proved the decisive try \u2013 but it probably should have been in vain given Gloucester\u2019s golden opportunity with less than 10 minutes remaining. Harlequins were leading 20-19 when Twelvetrees pushed his kick wide from just outside Quins\u2019 22. He had only just come on and the wind was a mitigating factor, with Lewis Ludlow required to hold the ball in position, as was the howling Harlequins crowd, but he can expect some extra kicking practice in the coming days. One also had to wonder why Danny Cipriani, who had been on kicking duties until then, did not assume responsibility and, while the visitors scored three tries \u2013 two through Ollie Thorley \u2013 to their hosts\u2019 two, they were ultimately made to pay for their errors, slipping to a fifth consecutive defeat. \u201cIt was gusty out there, there is always a bit of pressure when the crowd get on your back as well,\u201d said Gloucester\u2019s captain Ben Morgan. \u201cHe\u2019ll be disappointed with it but you can\u2019t put that as the reason why we lost.\u201d Dombrandt excelled on his return from injury, barging his way over from close range and enhancing his burgeoning reputation to help clinch a second Premiership win of the season for Paul Gustard\u2019s side. He was involved in Eddie Jones\u2019s preliminary training squad but the World Cup ultimately came too early for the 22-year-old No 8. It would be no surprise to see him involved in some capacity during the Six Nations, however, and he deserved the match-winning intervention for his all-round performance. \u201cIt was a very significant win,\u201d said Gustard. \u201cAlex is a champion, isn\u2019t he? He has a great feel for the game, he picks up lines really well and wants the ball. He is a big player for us and he gives us line breaks. He is 18 months into his professional career and we don\u2019t want to overcoach him.\u201d It was a contest light on quality \u2013 both sides have been scratching around for form of late \u2013 but there was endeavour among the two sets of a forwards and a commitment to keep the ball in hand. Harlequins were dealt a blow when Kyle Sinckler, due to make his first appearance since the World Cup final, was ruled out before kick-off with a minor calf injury but they started the brighter. The lock Stephan Lewies and Dombrandt caught the eye with some direct carrying and Smith opening the scoring with a straightforward penalty. Gloucester\u2019s forwards turned the screw thereafter, showing an ability to offload as well as carry hard and straight that put Harlequins on the back foot. One of those carries, from their World Cup winning lock Franco Mostert, led to Thorley\u2019s first try, the wing spotting a gap through the middle and darting straight through it. Harlequins responded when Ross Chisholm burst between Thorley and Jamal Ford-Robinson but Gloucester were undeterred and won a penalty deep in Harlequins territory soon after. Cipriani, who has not enjoyed the best of starts to the season, kicked to the corner and, after the forwards bashed away, the No 10 prised the opening with a swift pass to Thorley. It meant that Smith\u2019s penalty early in the second half edged Harlequins back ahead at 13-12 but two Gloucester penalties, both kicked to the corner by Cipriani, allowed the visitors to retake the lead with Morgan barging his way over from close range. Cipriani\u2019s conversion put Gloucester six points to the good but Harlequins responded through Dombrandt after a clever inside pass from Smith. Twelvetrees had the chance to swing the match back in Gloucester\u2019s favour, only to fluff his lines, before a last-gasp Smith penalty rounded things off to pull Harlequins clear of the danger end of the table."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
