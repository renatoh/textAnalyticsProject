A huge amount - especially when you're fresh out of your last year at school, 17 years old and waiting to see what life has to offer. Ellis is mooching along the high street, planning his future at university and feeling free - when he bumps into wild, skateboarding Jackie, who scoops him up and talks him into gatecrashing a party. It's the beginning of an adventure that will change the way he looks at the world for ever. He meets the wonderfully eccentric sisters, Ursa, Leona and Fox, who live with their weird guardian in the deserted Land-of Smiles motel. He falls in love with a girl whose job is laying out the dead, thwarts a kidnapping, confronts an old enemy and becomes a hero in the course of the next few hours. Margaret Mahy has an uncanny talent for an original plot, characters who stick in the mind and a way of looking at the world that will engage the most bored teenager. Great dialogue and a rush-along storyline that also will give pause for thought."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
