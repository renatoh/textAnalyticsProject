I would like to buy a club in Belgium. Can you help?", "bodyText": "The World Cup may well be \"a time to make friends\", as it has been officially trademarked, but it is also a time to make business deals while wearing a corporate hospitality laminate and wondering vaguely if your limo driver has planned a hoi polloi-free exit route out of the ground. This time around, the Fifa president Sepp Blatter's principled refusal to ignore the game's corporate interests has seen an unprecedented number of tickets fall into the hands of ordinary businessmen and moguls, and nowhere has this seemed more evident than in Hamburg in advance of Saudi Arabia's Group H match with Ukraine last night. On one side at least you felt it was not so much a football game that was in the offing, more an occasionally diverting backdrop for the brokering of big-money deals. Drunken Saudi flag-wavers partying in the city's Fan Fest venue were never that likely but it was something of a struggle to find a single Saudi fan on Hamburg's streets. Most were holed up in the city's most expensive hotel, the Four Seasons on Nord Jungfernstieg. \"Many very rich men in there,\" a local taxi driver explained. Good for business? \"No,\" he replied grimly. \"All have limos.\" All did indeed seem to have limos. A cavalcade was stationed outside, though guests rarely emerged to delight the lone flag-waving Saudi fan waiting outside in hope of a glimpse. Their business was indoors. The majority of the tables in the oak-panelled lounge were occupied by Middle Eastern men in suits or full white robes, with some watched over at a discreet distance by bodyguards. All the conversations seemed worthy of eavesdropping but perhaps the most intriguing was taking place at a lively table in one corner of the room. Seated on sofas and chairs around it were two men whose laminates appeared to identify them as connected to the official Saudi FA delegation, conversing in English with two men who appeared to be their Ukrainian counterparts. One of the Saudis acknowledged the problems of the world stage for a team drawn entirely from its national league. \"So let me tell you what we plan to do,\" he declared with relish. \"But this is top secret. The long-term problem with the Saudi team is that they don't ever play in Europe. So, we want to establish a special academy in Europe.\" How, his Ukrainian companion wondered? \"We buy a club,\" was the simple reply. \"But no one sees it is Saudi. They would see an offshore company.\" Which club? \"We looked at Napoli. But now, tell me, if you think there is anywhere better to buy it than Belgium, you tell me, because I don't think there is. So listen. We are looking between three clubs. Charleroi, FC Brussels and - please, a moment.\" He dialled a number on his mobile. \"What is the third club we look at to buy?\" he asked. \"Charleroi, yes yes, FC Brussels, yes.\" The call ended, he turned back to his audience. \"Beveren.\" (As readers will recall Beveren is currently the subject of a Belgian investigation into its ties with Arsenal.) \"Do you know people at Beveren?\" asked the Saudi gentleman. \"Not well,\" replied the Ukrainian noncommittally. \"But you are sure about Belgium?\" \"Yes. England, France, too many problems. So, what we do is we buy a club that already has fans. All ready. Then, we establish a school of excellence. We send 40 kids, pay for them, they learn there. From the ages of 17, maybe 18, to 21 they play in Europe, at European standard. Then we bring them back to Saudi. At the moment Saudi league is 100% Saudi. If we bring some kids from other countries, we would like to make it maybe 80% Saudi, 20% other countries.\" And money, ventured the Ukrainian? \"There is no problem with finance,\" said the Saudi smiling, a timeworn assumption about the kingdom further confirmed by yesterday's news that members of the national side were each being given a 100,000 riyals (\u00a314,500) for drawing against Tunisia last Wednesday. And with that, having taken a group photograph of their delegations - \"for Prince Sultan [the Saudi FA president]\" -the group dispersed. It is the candour that is so charming, all things considered. As for the other conversations about the room, who can say what they centred on, although debates on whether the coach Marcos Paqueta would deviate from his favoured 4-4-2 can probably be ruled out. In fact, two years ago, Hamburg hosted the annual global conference on oil refining and petrochemicals in the Middle East, and given the level of security presence and smell of money that hung about the hotel lounge yesterday, you could be forgiven for thinking it was holding an informal reprise. The only shame, perhaps, is that the Ukrainian prime minister was not in town to forge contacts. Only last week he was lamenting his country's failure to reduce its dependence on natural gas after the recent stand-off with their main supplier, Russia, had at one point resulted in Moscow switching off the Ukrainian supply and ended only with an agreement that saw the cost of gas doubled. Anyone wishing to do a deal on alternative energy sources could have done worse than linger in the Four Seasons lobby yesterday. In contrast Hamburg's Fan Fest would have yielded less. Plenty of klaxon-happy Ukrainians, certainly, but Saudis? Not so keen on these alcohol-sodden venues, it emerges. One person enjoying the festivities, however, was a local surgeon, who asked not to be named but confirmed that Hamburg has in recent years become one of the most popular choices for Middle Eastern visitors seeking treatment in one of the city's well regarded hospitals. So, catch a game, get a hip replacement, do some business, maybe buy a football club. This is your basic World Cup experience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
