Phil Jagielka will become Hodgson\u2019s sixth captain, leading out a team with Phil Jones restored in defence, Jonjo Shelvey anchoring midfield, Jamie Vardy incorporated into a front three and Jack Butland making his competitive debut. The Stoke goalkeeper will become the 31st player to be used by Hodgson in the qualification campaign, and Kyle Walker and Danny Ings could swell that total to 33 if they feature on the artificial pitch at the tiny LFF Stadium. Hodgson pointed to a number of long-term injuries to Jack Wilshere, Jordan Henderson, Fabian Delph, Luke Shaw, Danny Welbeck, Fraser Forster, Leighton Baines, Ryan Mason and Daniel Sturridge \u2013 the Liverpool striker has not played at all in the section \u2013 as having offered others an unexpected route into the senior squad. \u201cIf I\u2019d looked at the group we had in June and thought about what it would look like in October, there would have been six or seven who would have been with us now,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Dele Alli, for example, you have to bear in mind the number of injuries we\u2019ve had. He came in because an opportunity opened up with others moved aside. \u201cIt\u2019s not a situation where, the moment you kick the ball correctly from A to B, you\u2019ll get in the England team. It\u2019s not like that at all. But if you do come in and make an impact as a young player, and then there are a lot of injuries in the first team, it gives you that chance. I\u2019ve told Alli I\u2019m pleased to have him here, that he\u2019s here on merit, and he can handle the pressure, but I did say to him there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019d be with the U21s next time: \u2018Don\u2019t think you\u2019re a senior player. You\u2019re an England player now, but you could be in the seniors or in the U21s in the future.\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019ve had time in qualifiers to see a lot of players because we had so many injuries. Now we are going to concentrate on a core group who, if fit, will be with us in France. It won\u2019t be a moment to give someone a chance just because he\u2019s scored a goal on a Saturday. People will have to work very hard to break into the group now. I\u2019m optimistic these [injured] players will recover fully and will have enough time to play between their recovery and France, and I will be able to consider them. I know they have the quality and talent I\u2019m looking for. But I\u2019m also realistic. I can only pencil them in. I have to hope for the best.\u201d The number of players who have tasted competitive action in Group E does suggest the qualifying campaign has been one protracted experiment. Wales\u2019s successful passage to France was secured with the use of 24 players, and the reigning world champions, Germany, had used 29 before Sunday\u2019s final group game against Georgia in Leipzig. If Raheem Sterling does not start in Vilnius then Jones would be the only player to have started the first game of the campaign, a win against Switzerland at St Jakob Park 13 months ago, and the last fixture of the section. \u201cI am surprised [to learn] we have used so many,\u201d admitted Hodgson. \u201cThe enormous number of injuries might account for so many having played. But a lot of us have been together a long while now, plenty since 2012 so that will be over four years by the time the tournament in France comes around, so we have a good idea of the core that we\u2019d like going forward.\u201d The stadium\u2019s plastic pitch is apparently not a concern, though it did persuade Hodgson not to bring Gary Cahill, his captain at Wembley on Friday but prone to back problems, to Vilnius. The bounce of the ball was notably slow at training on Sunday and the surface will be watered heavily by the fire brigade before England seek to complete their first perfect qualification campaign. Only five teams \u2013 France in 1992 and 2004, the Czech Republic in 2000, and Germany and Spain in 2012 \u2013 have finished with full points from their groups. \u201cIt\u2019d be easy for people to say: \u2018They won all 10, but there was no Italy, Germany or France in their group, so what does it matter?\u2019\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cJust like they say: \u2018He won [five] back-to-back championships with Malmo but it\u2019s only Sweden \u2026\u2019 I retain the joy, energy and enthusiasm for this role, and I regard that as an achievement, working at this level with top players. Maybe when I\u2019m on my Zimmer frame, I\u2019ll say winning the championship in 1976 with Halmstads was my greatest achievement ... \u201d Success of some kind in France next summer may force a rethink."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
