Moat was yesterday offered another week to secure the funding required to purchase Newcastle by Mike Ashley, the current owner, but the Tyneside property developer has not yet convinced Barclays, the club's bankers, he is worth the risk of underwriting. If Moat's bid collapses, Ashley will remain in control for another season before attempting to find a viable buyer next summer. Newcastle have a \u00a340 million working overdraft facility, of which, according to club sources, they owe Barclays approximately \u00a320m \u2013 but that arrangement ends on Monday night. As things stand, Barclays will renew the agreement on Tuesday but with a reduced overdraft ceiling of \u00a310 million, the maximum sum the bank is generally prepared to lend to Championship clubs. Should Newcastle, currently making stringent efforts to reduce their liabilities by selling three players before the transfer window closes next week, fail to halve their current \u00a320m debt level by Tuesday, Barclays will demand an immediate repayment of \u00a310m. For every day it goes unpaid punitive rates of interest will be charged. Ashley has the funds to meet that debt, but such a demand would scupper Moat's hopes of buying the club and installing Alan Shearer as the new manager. The property developer and his backers are already struggling to meet Ashley's basic \u00a3100m asking price. He and his advisers are trying to persuade Barclays that Newcastle is a special case, worthy of the sort of significantly higher working overdraft facility they need. Moat and Seymour Pierce, the investment bank endeavouring to broker the sale, were encouraged when Barclays in the North East indicated that a larger loan may be possible but this idea was vetoed by senior management in London who are now reviewing Newcastle's position. Moat is proposing that the club's capacity to draw large home crowds \u2013 almost 44,000 watched their win against Sheffield Wednesday last Wednesday \u2013 demands different financial treatment. Ideally Barclays would be most comfortable if \u00a310m was raised in the next week and the club could then conform to the Championship lending ceiling. This though would impact severely on Moat's hopes of fulfilling Shearer's managerial ambitions. Although Chris Hughton's caretaker management has brought the best out in the team and they have won three and draw one of their four Championship fixtures to date, Newcastle's squad is already worryingly thin. Having already lost nine players, and signed just one on loan, this summer injuries in key positions could damage Newcastle's promotion hopes. Hughton has stated they can ill afford to lose anymore players and may be privately heartened by the reality that off-loading the trio earmarked for sale - Steven Taylor, Fabricio Coloccini and Jonas Gutierrez - could be easier said than done. Coloccini, an Argentine international defender, cost \u00a310m last summer but his \u00a371,000 weekly salaries allied to an on-going struggle to adapt to English football has deterred potential suitors. Meanwhile Coloccini's compatriot, Gutierrez is a winger whose promising approach play is all too often betrayed by poor crossing. Of the three Taylor is probably the most saleable but despite much talk of interest from Everton, David Moyes has consistently played down talk of the former England Under-21 international centre-half moving to Goodison Park. Taylor is not overly keen on leaving Tyneside but has told friends he fears \"the club are trying to force me out.\" Hughton meanwhile has urged Ashley to enhance Newcastle's promotion chances by signing Sol Campbell and Peter Lovenkrands, the former England defender and Danish winger, currently free agents, on one-year deals. Ashley is said to be very impressed by Hughton's stewardship and, should Moat's bid fall through, may offer the former Tottenham coach the manager's job in preference to David O'Leary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
