The probability of wet weather in Paris may influence England\u2019s selection in certain areas, not least at half\u2011back, the back-row and in midfield. So keen is Jones to locate the tactical antidote to his side\u2019s Calcutta Cup defeat that he rose at 4am on Monday, unable to sleep because of the matters raised by England\u2019s sub-par performance in Scotland. While he confirmed Dylan Hartley would continue to lead the team at the Stade de France, the head coach appears to be considering some changes to the starting XV. With the forecast for Paris somewhere between damp and torrential, and the pitch invariably on the heavy side, Jones is braced for a \u201cslogathon\u201d against a big French pack who might fancy an arm wrestle. England\u2019s desire to improve at the breakdown could involve the Bath flanker Sam Underhill and there is also a case for starting the Saracens\u2019 half\u2011back duo of Richard Wigglesworth and Owen Farrell on Saturday and bolstering the midfield with the physical Ben Te\u2019o. Wigglesworth\u2019s kicking game is as good as anyone\u2019s and France\u2019s formidable inside centre Mathieu Bastareaud will also be eyeing George Ford\u2019s channel. Jones has so far favoured dual playmakers at 10 and 12 but this weekend could conceivably prove an exception to the rule. \u201cI\u2019m not wedded to anything,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe players understand that. They\u2019ve got to perform. Who plays at 10 and 12 will be done on who we think is best for that game.\u201d To reinforce his point, the Australian wheeled out one of the oldest yarns in his coaching manual. \u201cThere\u2019s an old story about a coach with a bucket of water in his office. He\u2019d say: \u2018Come here son, put your hand in this bucket.\u2019 When the player took it out he\u2019d say: \u2018What\u2019s happened?\u2019 Your hand creates a hole but as soon as your hand comes out the hole\u2019s filled in. \u201cNo one\u2019s indispensable. It\u2019s the same with me. We\u2019re in a high\u2011performance environment. High performance means you\u2019ve got to perform. [If] I lose one game I might be on flight QF1 back to Sydney. Who knows? You see it in football all the time now and rugby is becoming more and more like football.\u201d Jones will have a clearer picture after training on Tuesday, with Sam Simmonds and Elliot Daly both back in contention for the matchday 23. Either way, he is not ruling out a \u201chorses for courses\u201d selection as England seek to maintain their Six Nations title hopes. \u201cThere is very heavy rain forecast and we all know the Stade de France is a heavy pitch anyway,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe could pick a team to play a \u2018slogathon\u2019. They will be very physical and aggressive. Jacques Brunel picks very big teams ... we know what is going to come at us, we have just got to be good enough to stop it.\u201d Even if England do slump to a second consecutive away defeat, Jones has already been enduring sleepless nights. \u201cLast night I woke up at 4am. I can\u2019t sleep because it annoys me losing a game we shouldn\u2019t have lost. There\u2019s usually a thought in my head. I go to the office and start sending texts and emails to various staff members. Some of them reply straight away, some of them don\u2019t. \u201cI always find it\u2019s the best time to think. I don\u2019t have anxiety, I just have thoughts about what we have to fix. If you ask any coach who has coached at a high level they would say the same. \u201cI\u2019ve coached for 20 years. If I\u2019d been anxious for 20 years I\u2019d be dead,\u201d Jones added. \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve learned is I should get two dogs \u2013 because then I\u2019ll always have two friends. I\u2019m looking for another dog at the moment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
