A flirty evening with a decent (over 6ft) guy and an opportunity to dress up fancy and get a nice ego boost. First impressions? I sent a panicked text to my friend five minutes in: \u201cHE IS FIT, HE IS NERVOUS, HE DOES MARATHONS, BUT HE IS FIT.\u201d I thought he was underdressed, but then I was slightly overdressed. What did you talk about? His volunteering, films, our love of festivals and bottomless brunches. Any awkward moments? There are moments you never want to relive, and our goodbye was one of them. I think I forced my phone number on him, before he went in for a peck on the lips, and ran away. Good table manners? Impeccable. Best thing about Freddy? He ticked so many boxes. Hannah and Freddy were a perfect match on paper, but I\u2019m unsure whether that translated to real life. Would you introduce him to your friends? If I scared him as much as I think I did, my friends would send him running. My mum would love him though. Describe Freddy in three words? Nervous, fit, talented. What do you think he made of you? I think I was a bit much for him. Did you go on somewhere? Yes, but he had a job interview the next morning. And... did you kiss? I\u2019m not going to count it. I want to just pretend it never happened. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Nerve levels. I think we would have fallen in love at a festival. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? He\u2019s an absolute catch but I\u2019m not sure its my rod he\u2019s after. Freddy on Hannah What were you hoping for? Good food and an interesting character to spend the evening with. First impressions? Brave heels, considering the free wine. What did you talk about? Music festivals, holidays, sport, drunken tales of years gone by. Any awkward moments? A particularly persistent street seller asked me to buy her a rose, but Hannah styled it out well. Good table manners? They went by the wayside early doors when we both attacked our starters sans cutlery. Best thing about Hannah? Her sense of humour. Would you introduce her to your friends? Why not? Describe Hannah in three words? Charming, funny, interesting. What do you think she made of you? I think she was expecting a psychopath, so by comparison I was golden. Did you go on somewhere? For one more drink at a fairly grotty pub around the corner. And... did you kiss? A slightly awkward peck in the depths of Oxford Circus tube station. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Scrap the espresso martinis: I was wired until about 2am. Marks out of 10? A solid 8. Would you meet again? Definitely as mates. Romantically, I\u2019m not sure there was that connection. \u2022 Hannah and Freddy ate at Scarlett Green, London W1. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com.
