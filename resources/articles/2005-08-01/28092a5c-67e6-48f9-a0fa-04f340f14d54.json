New operators are planning to put low-power transmitters in railway stations and shopping centres. When your mobile gets within 200 metres, it will pick up the new cell, you can roam to it and the provider will give you mobile calls at the price you would expect to pay for landline calls. \"We're champing at the bit,\" says Martin Wren-Hilton, chief executive of Coffee Telecom. \"It's a great opportunity for consumers to have more choice.\" Coffee has been developing the service at its Richmond office for the past two years, says Wren-Hilton, a 39-year-old entrepreneur who is said to have had a hand in the creation of mobile phone top-up cards. The service is similar to BT's Fusion, which lets a cellphone roam to a Bluetooth base station and (in a future version) a Wi-Fi hotspot. But, unlike Fusion and other \"fixed-mobile convergence\" services, it uses the same GSM technology as your existing phone service - and it works with existing handsets. Independent micro-cells have not been possible before, because the GSM radio spectrum is licensed to the big operators. Sometime in the next year, however, Ofcom, the regulator, will auction off enough spectrum for small operators such as Coffee to do their own thing. When radio spectrum was allocated for phones, a small gap - known as a \"guard band\" - was left between the frequencies used by mobiles and cordless phones. \"We're able to release that spectrum now, because technology has moved on,\" explains Ofcom spokesman Simon Bates. \"Today's GSM mobiles and Dect cordless phones can deal with the interference. We propose to release the guard band to the market as quickly as we can.\" It's Ofcom's first \"technology neutral\" auction. Whoever gets the licences - for two bands at 1.78 GHz and 1.88 GHz - can use any technology, as long as they keep the power below 200mw. Earlier this year, Ofcom's review of spectrum management decided that licence holders should be given a free hand to use any appropriate technology, as long as it does not interfere with users on neighbouring frequencies. In this case, however, there's little doubt how the spectrum will be used. There are tens of millions of GSM phones out there, ready to receive the signals without modifications. While 200mw isn't enough power to set up a new national network, it's fine for short-range cells. Wren-Hilton's proposed \"Coffee Zones\" would connect calls through an IP network to the telephone system. Calls to other Coffee users would be free, making Coffee a bit like Skype for your mobile. Calls out to other phones would cost about the same as those made on a BT landline. Outside the Coffee Zone, your phone reverts to its normal mobile service. Business services could be even more interesting. The Coffee base station will hook up directly to the office phone system, so workers' mobile phones will become office phone extensions. This could eliminate one of the biggest and most annoying items on corporate phone bills: the cost of mobile phone calls made while in the building. \"Coffee Telecom is the first of a new breed of fixed-mobile players,\" says Wren-Hilton. \"Customers will pay a high amount for full mobility, and smaller amounts for calls on the Coffee network.\" But the details need to be right. \"Technologically, if the service is going to fully work, it will need the co-operation of the mobile operators,\" says Amit Nagpal, senior consultant at Analysys Consulting. \"I'd be very surprised if mobile operators were very keen to work with Coffee.\" Wren-Hilton dismisses this objection. \"Our feedback, based upon discussion with the operators, is that in the long run they have more to gain than to lose, through roaming arrangements with us,\" he says. Coffee's plans are evolving as these discussions continue. Early accounts of its service describe users manually re-setting their phone at Coffee Zones, but Wren-Hilton promises a slicker service based on a Coffee SIM card. \"Users will get two numbers, one mobile and one geographic, based on a choice of 30 dialling codes,\" he says. \"It is like a portable landline, with cheap incoming calls.\" With a mobile operator as a partner, Coffee-enabled phones will be able to move smoothly on to the mobile network outside the Coffee Zone, says Wren-Hilton. The details of the pricing will involve many trade-offs. If users set up call-forwarding between their fixed and mobile Coffee numbers, they get one number, but will have to pay roaming charges when they receive calls. However, all this is in the future. First, the auction must take place - and the date has still to be fixed. It won't be a high-rolling affair like the 3G auction of 2000, says Bates, because it is most likely to be a single-round, sealed-bid auction. It will allocate between five and 10 licences, each of which will allow a provider to set up micro-cells anywhere in the country. As part of Ofcom's hands-off approach, the licence-holders will be required to agree terms among themselves for access to the 16 channels available when zones overlap. If they don't sort out a code of practice, Ofcom will have to step in and enforce one. Coffee doesn't expect to lose out in the auction, and Ofcom's Bates thinks the process is likely to get the spectrum into use. \"Every bidder will look at their business plan and bid on what it's worth, not what they think other people will bid, or other unhelpful criteria,\" he says. BT has expressed interest but made no commitment. \"We're assessing this, along with other spectrum possibilities announced by Ofcom recently,\" said a spokesman. \"There are limitations to this spectrum because it's narrowband using GSM.\" Other people who might want a licence, or a zone from an operator such as Coffee, include hospitals, museums, sports grounds and university campuses. Visitors to an art gallery could, for example, switch to an internal museum service and get an audio guide on their headphone, while football and cricket grounds could run their own commentary with local information services. So far, this whole development is exclusive to the UK market. However, other European regulators have Dect guard bands to dispose of, and will be watching to see how it works out. It could have a big impact on the voice on Wi-Fi market. Vendors are planning to sell complex dual-mode devices that can roam between cellular and Wi-Fi networks, in order to deliver the same benefits as Coffee. \"Voice over Wi-Fi is a niche play,\" says Wren-Hilton. \"There's a list as long as your arm of reasons why it is bad. There's security and battery life, but the biggest issue is operating in unlicensed spectrum, with a poor failure mode. When Wi-Fi is congested, the whole thing collapses like a pack of cards.\" Coffee is never going to compete with Wi-Fi's real strength, of course - fast data. Wren-Hilton promises that GPRS will be available, and email will work, but he isn't going to offer a laptop card for Coffee. \"We would rather give a good user experience on a BlackBerry, than a bad experience on a laptop,\" he says. So if your mobile offers you Coffee next year, think about taking up the suggestion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
