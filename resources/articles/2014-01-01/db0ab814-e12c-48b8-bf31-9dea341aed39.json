The clumsiness of the party's procedures and the lack of initiative by the leadership in dealing decisively with a long-standing problem have been brutally exposed. Lord Rennard's long, self-justifying statement merely confirms he still doesn't get that the kind of behaviour that might have been unremarkable in the party he joined 40 years ago is no longer acceptable. Suspended from the party on Monday, he can only interpret the complaints against him as a conspiracy, while he remains seemingly bewildered to find he has upset a great swath of the party to which he has devoted his life. It is hard to overstate the harm that this affair is doing: harm to the party's self-image, to the morale of its diminishing band of loyal supporters and more widely to the party's standing and reputation among voters. But this is not just a terrible blow for the Lib Dems, nor a Westminster story set in conference hotels late at night, nor a political tale laced with conspiracy and personal grudges. The experience of the small group of women who found the courage to complain about Lord Rennard will be recognised by millions of other women: in workplaces everywhere more senior men abuse their power with unwanted sexual attention to young women who, if they have the confidence to complain, find themselves belittled and their concerns dismissed. In a world where women who have babies can be described, as they were by Nigel Farage on Monday, as having less worth to employers than men, the gap between now and a future that is really equal can seem almost unbridgeable. Behaviour does not need to be criminal to undermine confidence and reinforce prejudice. In a particularly revealing intervention this week, the Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies, one of Lord Rennard's loyal band of supporters, complained \"it's not Jimmy Savile\". This is the attitude of people who do not recognise that there is a continuum of abuse where the entry level is the kind of mild sexual harassment that leaves the victim not sure whether to laugh and risk encouraging it, or protest and look humourless or even \u2013 as Mr Clegg clumsily had it in his Today programme interview \u2013 shrill. The inappropriate contact and the overfamiliar personal remark are just small markers in a sick ecology by which the exercise of power over the vulnerable is legitimised. This affair shows what happens in an organisation that has a kind of institutional blindness to women. To preserve their principles, Lib Dems have always resisted positive discrimination in any form: as a result, they have a mere seven women MPs, five of whom are in very marginal seats. Women are under-represented in the senior ranks of the party. It's not the kind of environment that is sensitive to the impact of inappropriate behaviour to women; nor, it has emerged, is it the kind of environment that treats its more junior employees with proper respect. Complaints against Lord Rennard were ignored for more than a decade. Action was taken last February only after some of the women decided to take their case to Channel 4 News. The Lib Dem leadership will be desperately hoping that as the extent of the damage has become plain, the affair may be limping towards some kind of mediated settlement. But it has already done a great deal of damage. On Monday, Nick Clegg made an important speech on new approaches to mental health that was completely overshadowed. Senior, well-known Lib Dem figures, like the peers who thought it appropriate to welcome Lord Rennard back on to the party benches, have been revealed to be utterly tone deaf to the experiences of women. The party organisation has been exposed as inept. Political catastrophe can, occasionally, be turned to advantage. But it takes an honest evaluation of what has gone wrong, and a genuine willingness to make sure it never happens again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
