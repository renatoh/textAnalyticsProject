Dunfermline beat Stenhousemuir 7-1. However, following the match, it was confirmed that the Pars had fielded the suspended Calum Woods, who came on as a second-half substitute with his team 4-0 up. A decision has yet to be made by the Scottish Football Association on whether Dunfermline will be ejected from the competition. Two seasons ago Brechin were thrown out of the Cup for fielding two ineligible players. The SFA is expected to make a decision ahead of the fifth-round draw today. The Partick Thistle manager Ian McCall described his side's exit as \"horrible\" after Damian Casalinuovo scored Dundee United's opener with his hand to help United win 2-0. The Partick substitute Liam Buchanan missed two great chances before David Goodwillie doubled the lead in the last minute. Second-half goals from Darren Mackie and Lee Miller put Aberdeen into the fifth round at the expense of a dire Hearts, while Hibs ran out 3-0 winners against the junior league side Irvine Meadow. The home side rode their luck until Alexander Ryan's own goal just before the half-hour. Merouane Zemmama and Paul Hanlon made the game safe after the break. Billy Mehmet scored twice as St Mirren defeated Alloa 3-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
