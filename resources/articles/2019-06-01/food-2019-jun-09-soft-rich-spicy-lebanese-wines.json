Step forward and take a bow Ottolenghi and admirers/imitators, but then see also how hummus is not the shorthand for middle-class faddishness anymore (apparently two in five fridges contain the stuff). Eastern Mediterranean wine is also bubbling up, although not to anything like the same degree; it\u2019s still hard to get your hands on much Israeli wine. But Lebanese wine is much easier to find and, from what I\u2019ve tasted recently, it\u2019s never been better. The oldest extant Lebanese producer is Ch\u00e2teau Ksara, which started life in 1857. Its cabernet-shiraz blend is a good place to start if you\u2019ve never had a Lebanese wine, with its characteristically warm, spice-inflected soft and rich fruitiness. Domaine Des Tourelles Vieilles Vignes Cinsault, Lebanon, 2017 (\u00a317.49, Flagship Wines) Winemaking in the Lebanon has an ancient heritage \u2013 one of the world\u2019s oldest. But its modern-day style owes much to the French, who were the colonial masters here in the early 20th century. You can see their influence in another of the country\u2019s biggest names, Domaine des Tourelles, founded in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon\u2019s wine heartland, by Fran\u00e7ois-Eug\u00e8ne Brun in 1868, and where the winemaker today, Faouzi Issa, learned his trade working at top French estates Ren\u00e9 Rostaing, in the northern Rh\u00f4ne, and Ch\u00e2teau Margaux in Bordeaux. The Tourelles range takes influences from both those regions, but conjures something very distinctive in the wine it makes from French grape variety cinsault, with its fresh cherry fruit and flavours of cinnamon and chocolate-raisin. Musar Jeune Red, Lebanon, 2016 (\u00a311.99, Virgin Wines) The most famous vinous name in Lebanon \u2013 and the estate that did most to keep Lebanese wine alive during the civil war \u2013 is Ch\u00e2teau Musar. The company\u2019s original charismatic driving force, Serge Hochar, died in 2014 \u2013 although all of the currently available vintages of the family\u2019s top, eponymous estate, cabernet sauvignon-carignan-cinsault red blend predate his passing. Like top gran reserva Rioja (which in many ways Musar resembles, although it also has much in common with top Rh\u00f4ne and Bordeaux) these are wines that are mature on release but also age beautifully. I haven\u2019t tasted it for a while, but I\u2019d be tempted by the 2002 on offer for \u00a330 at Roberson. I\u2019d be happy, too, with the more upfront fruit and freshness of the Jeune Red wine by Hochar\u2019s family from younger vines.
