The cosiest way to enjoy a ski holiday is in a log cabin. Here are six of the best. Ruka Finland Stay in log cabins in pretty woodland in the resort of Ruka, Finnish Lapland, just 25km from the Russian border, and step straight from the front door on to excellent cross-country tracks. There are a variety of cabins, each with a mezzanine level. The smallest sleeps up to four with a double and single mattress on the mezzanine level and a single sofa bed in the open plan living room/kitchen. The largest, comprising three twin bedrooms and two extra beds on the mezzanine, sleep up to eight. All cabins are self-catering and have showers, sauna, fireplace, TV, video. With the Rukahovi Hotel nearby breakfast and dinner can be pre-booked. \u00b7 Inghams (020 8780 4433; inghams.co.uk) has a week from \u00a3325 based on two sharing, including flights. Geilo Norway They're log cabins by definition but the Bardola Cabins in the Norwegian resort of Geilo are essentially annexes of the nearby hotel of the same name. Guests get the best of both worlds - the freedom of self-catering and access to all the hotel's facilities. Only the use of the swimming pool incurs a small charge. The cabins, a 20-minute walk from the main resort and ski slopes, sleep four to eight and have four bed rooms, separate dining and living areas complete with a TV and open fireplace. With wide, uncrowded slopes, Geilo is ideal for beginners. There are five black runs, though for more adventurous off-piste skiing, day trips to the neighbouring resort of Hemsedal are recommended. \u00b7 Neilson (0870 33 33 356; neilson.co.uk) has a seven-night package for \u00a3335 for 23 January departures. Dog Sled Safari in Lapland Accommodation doesn't come much more rustic than these huts in Pallas-Ounas National Park - no electricity, no running water and no toilet. Those signing up for a six-night dog-sled safari tour with Activities Abroad should be prepared for an adventure, driving their own dog sled through stunning forests, fells and across frozen lakes. Cooking during the four-night stay is over a huge open fire. The huts do have a sauna, however, standard fare in Finnish Lapland. \u00b7 Travel with Activities Abroad (0870 444 5320; activitiesabroad.com) from \u00a3815 to \u00a3930, including all meals, transfers and equipment but not international flights. Rocky Mountain Snowshoe Colorado, US These 'wild west' cabins are located in deep powdery snow far from the swanky ski resorts in the Rocky Mountains. Enjoy an eight-night tour to this dramatic mountain landscape, with six nights at a cabin overlooking Moose Lake in the national park. Groups of fewer than eight people will stay in the main log house with shared bathrooms, kitchen and a lakeview deck. A smaller cabin is also used for larger groups. \u00b7 The eight-night snowshoe tour, departing 11 March, is \u00a31,199 inclusive of flights to Denver, transfers, meals at the cabins and activities with Exodus (0870 240 5550; exodus.co.uk/snow). Cross country skiing, snowmobiling and dogsledding are also available. The Norwegian Highlands The hamlet of Gala, in the Gudbrandsdalen valley, north of Lillehammer, is a cross-country skiers' paradise with 630km of trails for all abilities. InnTravel offers a variety of self-catering cabins, many of which give direct access to marked trails. The smaller cabins sleep up to six, with two bedrooms, the option of adding two beds in the loft and a lounge/dining room. Larger cabins can sleep up to eight - one of the two bedrooms contains bunk beds. All cabins have a wood-burning stove. Although self-catering, package prices include three dinners at the Gala Hogfjellshotel. Essential groceries are delivered prior to arrival and you can stock up from a nearby shop. \u00b7 With InnTravel (01653 617788; inntravel.co.uk), seven nights between 12-26 February cost \u00a3898pp, based on two adults sharing, including flights from Heathrow. Additional adults cost \u00a3440. Yll\u00e4s Finland Privately owned cabins are scattered around the more secluded areas of Yll\u00e4s, one of Finnish Lapland's largest ski resorts. Geared towards independent travellers, the cottages have their own sauna and open fireplaces, and many are located in forest settings. Shops are about a 10-minute walk away. \u00b7 Norvista's (0870 7447 315; norvista.co.uk) Yll\u00e4s self-catering cottages and cabins cost \u00a3711pp, based on two sharing a one bedroom cabin for seven nights.
