Could you tell me what equipment I will need - I am not keen to invest too much money - and where to find some reasonably priced places that offer tuition? Simon Lewin A:When you are starting out it is best to hire the skinny skis, soft boots and ski poles in Norway. Later on, when you have a clearer idea of what you want to buy, you will find the best choice in the resort. Wear a lightweight thermal base layer, followed by a thin fleece, and finally a shell ski jacket and trousers. Make sure nothing is too bulky as this sport really heats you up. Shell trousers (\u00a360) and breathable jacket (\u00a380) by Mountain Hard Wear, a thin fleece and thermals (from \u00a325) by Peak Performance can all be bought at Snow + Rock (0845 1001000, snowandrock.com). Blacks stores (0800 214890, blacks.co.uk) sell Falke SK1 cross-country socks (\u00a314.99) and Berghaus wind gripper gloves (\u00a327.99). A holiday to Norway won't be cheap, but there are some deals that include equipment and lessons. Gala is a good place to learn, and Inntravel (01653 629010, inntravel.co.uk) runs two Cross-country Try It Out Weeks for \u00a3720 on January 11, and \u00a3835 on February 1. Prices include half-board accommodation, three, two-hour lessons, equipment hire, flights and transfers. Waymark (01753 516477, waymarkholidays.com) recommends the resort of Hallingen for beginners, from \u00a3635pp per week half board, including flights and transfers, packed lunches, equipment hire, and up to five hours of tuition daily. Q: Do any companies run women-only ski holidays in Europe? I skied with the family for the first time last year, but I need more tuition before we hit the slopes again in February. Lesley A: Simply Ski (020-8541 2209, simplyski.co.uk) is running Women-only Ski Clinics in M\u00e9ribel on January 11 and 18. The courses are aimed at people who can manage blue runs, and will involve 3-4 hours of tuition daily over four days, with video playback sessions after skiing. Cost \u00a3580pp for one week on January 11, \u00a3600pp on January 18, both half-board including flights and transfers. Additional \u00a3125pp for the course. Q: I am a good intermediate skier, but I'm bored with all that and would like to try off-piste. The problem is how to get started - most of the operators either have nothing about off-piste or assume some level of experience. Also where is best for a novice off-pister? Peter Martin A: There is no better place to learn off-piste skiing than Chamonix/ Argenti\u00e8re. In any resort, the local ski school or mountain guiding company is the place to ask about guides. Ski Weekend (08700 600 615, skiweekend.com) runs specialist courses in Chamonix called Toutes Neiges Tous Terrains, which are for anyone wanting to try off-piste skiing. You will learn how to master a variety of terrain, but if there is fresh snow you will only ski powder. Courses run December 4-8, and every weekend in January. No previous off-piste experience is necessary. Cost: \u00a3649pp for four nights' B&amp;B, including guiding, flights and transfers. The Ski Club of Great Britain (0845 458 0780, skiclub.co.uk) has Aspirers' Powder Week in Argenti\u00e8re January 3-10, costing \u00a3850pp half board, including guiding, flights and transfers. \u00b7 Felice Hardy is co-editor of The Good Skiing and Snowboarding Guide.
