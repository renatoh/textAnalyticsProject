Racing is feeling the big freeze most - five of today's six meetings have been called off, the sole survivor being the all-weather card at Southwell. All today's eight Premiership fixtures appeared to have survived the freeze that has forced many postponements in the Nationwide League, from Darlington down to Brighton. The highest-profile casualty is Wolves' visit to Crewe, with Dave Jones's team deprived of the chance to top the First Division. Preston's game at home to struggling Sheffield Wednesday is also off. Five games have fallen in the Second Division, where high-flying Brighton and Brentford, at home to struggling Northampton and aspiring Cardiff respectively, will be inactive today. Tranmere's trip to Oldham depends on a pitch inspection. The Third Division feels the chill most, with eight out of 12 scheduled games off. The leaders Plymouth, due to have met Swansea at the Vetch Field in a lunchtime fixture, are among the victims, along with the basement battle between Halifax and York at the Shay. Two rugby league friendlies are also off. Wakefield's Super League warm-up match at home to Halifax was postponed yesterday, quickly followed by a knockout for St Helens' trip to Warrington. With very cold weather forecast to continue today, several pitch inspections are planned and fans are advised to check radio and television bulletins. Although temperatures are expected to rise slowly over the following 24 hours, eight Scottish League games scheduled for tomorrow have already been called off. In racing, today's jumping meetings at Cheltenham, Leicester, Catterick, Exeter and Plumpton all succumbed yesterday, leaving Southwell as the sole attraction. This followed a \"whiteout\" yesterday, the five scheduled meetings being called off. And the prospects for the next couple of days are bleak. The stewards at Ayr have brought forward their inspection for tomorrow's meeting. Planned for 10.30am today, it has been rearranged for 8am. A course spokesman said yesterday: \"We had -6C [21F] last night and we are looking at -4C tonight. The track is frozen.\" The west of Scotland course was criticised in some quarters for the late abandonment of its Boxing Day meeting after temperatures plummeted during the morning. Some racegoers had already arrived at the course when the programme was called off after a hastily arranged 11.30am inspection. The prospects at Folkestone tomorrow are described as \"pretty slim\". An inspection will be held today at 8am. The clerk of the course Chris Stickels said: \"The chances are pretty slim. The ground is frozen. It was unraceable yesterday and is unraceable today. The forecast is for -5C tonight and for between -3 and -5 tomorrow night.\" Sedgefield's chances of going ahead on Thursday also look bleak because of a frozen track. There will be an 11.30am inspection tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
