His team comfortably dismantled Swansea City in a 4-0 victory at the Liberty Stadium on Wednesday but Guardiola is adamant his side can still improve. City\u2019s landmark win means they have broken Arsenal\u2019s record of 14 straight victories between February and August 2002. \u201cIn history there were amazing things like Liverpool in the 80s and [Manchester] United with Sir Alex Ferguson or Chelsea with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, there were some amazing teams,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cBut we are the first ones to win 15 in a row. If we win the title it will just be a record and this record will be broken but, of course, it will not be easy. \u201cBecause 15 games in a row in the Premier League in this period is really complicated. Of course we were lucky in some moments and we scored in the last minutes, I remember at Bournemouth, for example. But it means a lot in the faith and desire to win again, and again and again. \u201cIt means a lot. Once the record will be broken because records are there to be broken but for it to be the first time to make 15 wins in a row when the level is so competitive means we are strong in the head. Normally you can decrease your concentration but to do it 15 times in a row means every time we are there. I am so, so happy.\u201d Goals by Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Kevin De Bruyne and a David Silva double ensured City cruised to victory over a poor Swansea side but Guardiola believes his team can perform even better. He also praised their mental resolve, and dismissed complacency being problem before facing Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday evening. \u201cOf course, as there are always individual mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I cannot deny that the performance was so high tonight. We spoke about that, to have [Manchester] United and Tottenham and in the middle Swansea, the bottom of the league. \u201cPeople have said a lot of good things about how good we play, and sometimes you can be distracted with this kind of thing but it was the opposite. [The assistant coach] Mikel Arteta came in after the warm-up and said you cannot imagine how good they did the warm-up, and that is a good thing. They were ready and that\u2019s why we showed what we showed tonight.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
