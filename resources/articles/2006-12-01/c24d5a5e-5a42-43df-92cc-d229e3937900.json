Winners and losers in 2006", "bodyText": "Jeff Randall Editor-at-large, Daily Telegraph The best of the year was John Humphrys's essay on Radio 4, Aberfan 40 Years On. In addition to his incisive reporting from Iraq, John went back to the place he visited as a young reporter in South Wales for a powerful and evocative piece of journalism. I'm not ashamed to admit that he reduced me to tears. It was the power of words over pictures, and in that sense radio is a more powerful medium than television. He delivered it with appropriate gravity - a world-class piece of journalism and a brilliant decision by the editor to send him back. The turkey of the year has got to be NTL's abortive bid for ITV. Not only were they completely outmanoeuvred by the Murdochs, they left themselves vulnerable because they now look like a troubled company without a Plan B. It was always going to be difficult to persuade the shareholders to accept a bid from NTL, but when NTL said it didn't realise the ITV stake bought by Sky was for sale, it demonstrated an alarming naivety about how stock markets work. Ralph Bernard Chief executive, GCap The cracker is actually something that hasn't happened - the predicted demise of radio audiences hasn't come to pass. It remains one of the most robust of the traditional media - which is a pretty spectacular achievement in the face of the most sustained attack there has ever been from competing formats. The thing that has helped that is the rise and rise of digital radio. By the end of the year we will have close to 5 million sets in the UK; up from 3 million last year; and it took us five years to get to that figure. That is a clear and unequivocal trend. It shows radio has a pretty encouraging future, albeit it in a slightly different way than I would have envisaged 10 years ago. As for a turkey, I don't suppose there is a single person in the radio business who would say this has been a terrific year for revenues. I've worked harder this year than I've worked in my life and it is hard. We have to recognise that the business model for radio is undergoing changes. That's one of the reasons Capital Radio will continue to have fewer adverts. We're in the age of advertising avoidance. People want to extend the enjoyment of whatever medium they are consuming and not have interruptions. Capital will continue to run only two ads in a row, even though it costs us money. Patience Wheatcroft Editor, the Sunday Telegraph We've seen one of the best continuing stories in a very long time. John Prescott's antics provided plenty of entertainment; the cash-for-honours issue has just about all the ingredients that journalists could wish for; and the Brown/Blair saga is a source of endless fascination. While these constitute a miserable reflection of our government, they are undeniably enjoyable for journalists. However, this year's upsurge in giveaway newspapers depresses me. People tend to place less value on things for which they do not pay. There is the risk that we are rearing a generation which will not be prepared to pay for its newspapers. Tyler Brul\u00e9 Chairman of publishing firm Winkreative and the soon-to-launch magazine Monocle It took them long enough but I love Al-Jazeera International. The diversity of reporting has been great and there's much 'of the future' with bulletins from Kuala Lumpur framed by the Petronas Towers. CBS's lacklustre relaunch of their newscast with Katie Couric is a spot-on tie with the equally dull overhaul of BBC Breakfast's news set. Is it a subliminal commercial tie-up with Sainsbury's with all that orange and blue? Jeff Henry Head of ITV's Consumer Division If we are talking about programmes, the cracker would have to be Prime Suspect, but in my own area I would say the cracker of the year was ITV1 launching on 3G mobile phones, with over 100,000 downloads in the first three weeks alone. My turkey of year was the All Star Talent Show on C5 - abysmal. Neil Jones Managing director, Carat A few high points. Firstly, Metro. It has continued to grow because it has a very strong niche in the market place - young readers - which the nationals continue to lose. The continued decline of the national press, which is still falling 3 or 4 per cent a year, continues to be a disappointment. The growth of Freeview has given digital TV a huge boost and it wouldn't surprise me if it overtook Sky next year. For Sky, High Definition TV is fantastic. ITV has been a low. It has bottomed out and Grade's going to be interesting next year. He has already had an impact on morale but the summer was dreadful for them. Commissioning a second series of Celebrity Love Island was a mistake. Michael Wolff Columnist, Vanity Fair Crackers and turkeys together: 2006 marked the end of news as we know it, the end of television as we know it, and, finally, the end of moguls as we know them. Even the New York Times, that special exception to the economic woes of news, entered existential territory: the inevitable end of the Times became a perfectly reasonable theory to espouse. The tsunami of video that has flooded everybody's broadband connection during the past 12 months - YouTube is just one small part of the wave - is a phenomenon that not only threatens television, but changes the very form of video as well as the very notion of who makes video and why. As for moguls, we had the spectacle of Viacom's 82-year-old Sumner Redstone, that orange-haired lion (Rupert Murdoch, too, with his young wife, went orange this year), walking into walls as he roused himself for one last burst of corporate mayhem, one last howl of dominance - a massacre of movie stars [he fired Tom Cruise] and media executives [Viacom CEO Tom Freston] - before the dying of the light. Dylan Jones Editor, GQ Cracker of the year would have to be Matthew D'Ancona's relaunch of the Spectator. I'm sure I'll be accused of log-rolling, but heigh-ho. He has done a great job and should be applauded for it. The turkey of the year is obviously the OFT ruling on magazine distribution, as this could have an adverse effect on many smaller publishers. Distribution will become more expensive, shelf space will be harder to claim. Jane Lighting Chief executive, Five ITV's coup in persuading Michael Grade to become their executive chairman, completely catching everyone else out and giving the broadcaster a much-needed shot in the arm, was a real cracker. And then the BBC losing Michael Grade as chairman, while in the midst of the protracted licence renewal negotiations with the government, gave the broadcaster an unwelcome shot in the foot. Peter Horrocks Head of TV news, BBC Will Lewis, new editor of the Daily Telegraph, is my cracker for having the bravery to take on the forces of conservatism inside and outside the paper by plunging fully into the digital age. And his comrade-in-arms Jeff Randall, for breaking the media story of the year on Michael Grade's move and promoting the story and himself across all outlets. My turkey is Michael Grade. Having threatened to resign if the BBC chairman's job wasn't designed as he wanted, he then got bored with the job that was designed as he wanted and resigned anyway. Mark Borkowski Founder, Borkowski PR The success of Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat is a cracker. It takes a British comedian to show Hollywood how to promote a movie properly. Heather Mills and Paul McCartney are both turkeys. You could tell more about the machinations and the battles between them by the PR advisers who came in and out of her life and changed her strategy. Also, the gaffe in the royal household, when Camilla repeated Diana's mistake [by accidentally exposing her ankle coming out of a mosque in Lahore]. When it comes to choosing between fashion and political correctness there's only one decision in Pakistan and it is a sari and trousers. Conor McNicholas Editor, NME My hit of the year was Lauren Laverne's XFM breakfast show. To make an impact in the notoriously aggressive and testosterone-fuelled London breakfast radio market is impressive enough. For a woman to achieve it with a lone-gun format is nothing short of magnificent. Lauren's show is both refreshing and addictive. Great to hear real talent blossoming. The turkey was Russell Brand's Got Issues on E4. Hottest talent of the year, great on Big Brother's Big Mouth, great in the Guardian, legendary at the NME Awards ... so what happened here? The only saving grace was that no-one ever saw it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
