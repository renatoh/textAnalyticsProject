Tales of horror, of whole families incinerated in their cars, of young girls perishing because they went back for their horses, of a husband staying and dying, while a wife fled and survived \u2013 the full impact of a once-in-a-generation disaster that reached beyond people's ability to resist it. Most Australians get some training in basic fire strategy \u2013 the now well-known \"stay and defend or go early\" strategy, which recognises that bushfires move faster than people or cars, but will often leap across the ground, making digging in your best chance of survival \u2013 but these are intended for \"milder\" conflagrations. Coming at the end of a week long, exceptional heatwave, in the midst of a years-long drought, Black Saturday re-asserted nature's capacity to re-assert its power. Modern life, bereft of traditional explanations of cosmic punishment or divine action perhaps inevitably looks for someone, anyone, to blame. Absent the capture of the arsonists who may be responsible for a few of the dozen or so fires, a great deal of heat has fallen on greens and environmentalists, with Rupert Murdoch's the Australian newspaper leading the charge. For the last week, the paper has been running an unbroken series of comments suggesting that \"latte conservationists\" are partly or largely to blame for the nearly 200 deaths. How did they do this? Allegedly by frustrating the ability of forest managers to clear the landscape of \"forest fuel\", the bracken and detritus that fills the ground, if areas of forest are not subject to controlled burning. For the Australian's editorial writers, the lack of such burns were due to green activists who wanted to keep \"pristine-like bushland \u2026 in pre-human conditions\" . Some environmental groups do argue for relatively low levels of controlled burning, which makes for an easy target. But the truth is more complex. Controlled burning has costs and benefits \u2013 since it has to be done in hot, dry conditions in order to thoroughly clear the floor, it can itself be a cause of uncontrolled burns, ie bushfires. The 1939 bushfires, which destroyed five times the area of Victoria in 2009 were largely caused by poorly planned over-burning. Controlled burning in areas where seeding and growth is generated by fire can have the paradoxical effect of training the area to grow back more strongly \u2013 one of the reasons why Aborigines practised comprehensive controlled burning pre-1788. Most importantly however, forest fuel levels played no key part in the lethality of last week's fires. Most of the fires occurred in well-worked areas of forest with low fuel levels \u2013 in 2002, fires in national parks with high-fuel levels had consumed 10 times the area, but with no fatalities. What killed so many this year was the speed of the fire, on which fuel levels have no effect, since fires proceed at the crown and canopy level, jumping from treetop to treetop. The fires raced through burnt and unburnt areas alike, leaping roads and clearings. There's certainly an argument for re-examination of forest fuel levels on a case-by-case basis, but that isn't the purpose of the campaign against \"people-hating\" greens. Murdoch's Australian operations (contrary to his rather sinister assertion that global warming messages would be \"inserted\" into News Corporation's coverage globally), are clearly the last redoubt of climate-change scepticism. In the wake of a devastating fire amid practically unprecedented temperatures in conditions of extreme dryness, it is inevitable that people will start to ask whether the culprit is climate change. One event, by definition, cannot establish this (as some claim it does), but this year's fires give us a \"marker\" \u2013 if there were one or two more like this in the next few years, breaking the once-a-generation pattern, then that could count as evidence of climate shift, with important consequences for fire strategy. At the start of the week, the paper accused climate change campaigner Clive Hamilton of \"loving\" the bushfires. By week's end they were comparing climate-change-based explanations to the ravings of fundamentalist pastor Danny Nalliah, who saw the fires as punishment for legalised abortion. Such cheap culture war baiting seems to be out of touch with the desire of most Australians to have a forthright and wide-ranging rethink of fire strategy \u2013 and to mourn victims of simple bad luck. Easy explanations are simply the myths that a scientistic culture tells itself in situations where nature has made a late fightback \u2013 and a way of avoiding the most difficult task of all, confronting death and destruction, squarely without consolation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
