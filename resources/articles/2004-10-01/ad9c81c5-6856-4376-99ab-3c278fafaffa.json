If you want to link it to the US election, I'm afraid that the dream scenario was for the Yankees to reach the World Series - and then lose. When the Yankees go to the series in a presidential year, their fortunes usually predict the outcome: when they lose, the Democrat wins, and when they win, the Democrat almost always loses. The one exception is 1996 when they and the Democrats both won. And as to hoping the Red Sox win the World Series: don't get the idea that they are some sort of underdog. They have a huge payroll; they just keep coming second, that's all. Christopher Hilton London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
