South Africa will be rumbling mauls and scrums at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome tomorrow afternoon, determined to tire out a Fiji eight who never stopped running against Wales last week. The Springboks' pack averages 50 caps a man and the coach, Jake White, has chosen four props in his match-day squad, ensuring that the islanders' front row will have no respite. The man charged with stopping South Africa from reducing the Fiji scrum to rubble is the 30-year-old, 17-cap Henry Qiodravu, who plays for Orleans in the French third division. He had played at loose-head prop all his career but was converted to the tight-head out of necessity. White yesterday said that for any team the tight-head prop was the most valuable player. Qiodravu, drafted in by Fiji after the collapse of their scrum against Wales last week, tips the scales at more than 19st and he will need every ounce tomorrow as he finds himself up against the most experienced prop in the tournament, the 35-year-old 77-cap Os du Randt. \"I know it is going to be the biggest test of my career but I have a job to do,\" he said. \"Everybody in rugby has heard of Os du Randt but the prospect of taking him on does not daunt me. We could have a few surprises for South Africa.\" He said his scrummaging had improved considerably in his two years with Orleans. \"A concern in Fiji is that clubs do not have any money so it is rare to come across a scrummaging machine,\" he added. \"Our problem is not that we lack size or ability, we simply struggle when it comes to technique because we lack facilities at home. When we get our set pieces right, the rest of the world can watch out.\" South Africa have previously played Fiji only once, back in 1996, and their enemy is complacency. The centre Jaque Fourie put them on the back foot this week when, ungraciously, he said Fiji were not worthy of the Springboks' respect. The wing Bryan Habana had a different take yesterday. \"Fiji have had an outstanding World Cup and it is good for rugby that they have made the knockout stage,\" he said. \"We know that we have to get our structure right, otherwise we will be punished. These guys are lethal when they win turnover ball and they have helped make this an outstanding tournament. We are not taking anything for granted.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
