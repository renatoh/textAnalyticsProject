The double bill will take you up to the early screenings of part three at 6am. For those who prefer their comic book movies on the sunny side, the Prince Charles's Comic Book All-Nighter includes Batman's 1966 big-screen debut. Adam West's camp, colourful crimefighting could make even Christian Bale smile. BFI IMAX, SE1, Thu &amp; 2 Aug; Prince Charles Cinema, WC2, Fri The Lodger &amp; Nitin Sawhney, London A long-time devotee of Hitchcock's default composer Bernard Herrmann, Nitin Sawhney gets the chance to score Hitchcock's 1926 silent The Lodger. Which means, he points out, that Herrmann is now posthumously following in his footsteps. Sawhney brings his own blend of Anglo-Indian influences to complement The Lodger's dark, expressionist-influenced tale of a suspected London serial killer. Regarded as Hitchcock's first proper thriller, it's a fascinating foretaste of what would become the director's familiar themes. Tonight sees the world premiere of a brand-new restoration of the film, along with the new score performed live by Sawhney's band and the London Symphony Orchestra, plus a post-screening Q&amp;A. The event will be broadcast live to selected UK cinemas. Sawhney is also in conversation after a screening at the BFI on 10 Aug, when the film gets its cinema release, while his soundtrack is out on CD and download on 23 Jul.
