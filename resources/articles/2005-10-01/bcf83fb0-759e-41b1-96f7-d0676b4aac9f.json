As Kevin Spacey plays him at the Old Vic, Richard raises his chin, juts out his jaw, and breathes in deeply, filling with the self-righteous vision that his is no ordinary reign, but a divine mission. He is, in fact, God's representative on earth. The scene is reproduced, minus the crown and ermine, almost daily at the Kensington headquarters of the Daily Mail. Here Paul Dacre, editor of a newspaper that regularly sells more than 2m copies (but is read by three times that number, according to its marketing people), decides the line he will take on subjects from immigration to extra- terrestrials, as well as the writers, the headlines, the photographs, that will appear on every page of his organ. Here his favourites (dubbed Dacre's golden boys) surround their leader wearing an expression that speaks of boundless ambition as well as cowed respect. Scheming courtiers are a regular fixture in any Fleet Street newspaper; but Dacre's golden boys deserve special attention. It is not just the Mail's immense influence - witness the courtship by New Labour, and more recently by the Tory hopefuls. Dacre's centralising tendencies, the crucial role played by editors in his tabloid, and talk of Dacre's ascension to a new role as editor-in-chief (and predictions that his longtime deputy Alastair Sinclair will shortly to retire) make those who are in his inner circle far more than mere backroom boys. John Steafel, Martin Clarke, Ian MacGregor and Ted Verity make up the foursome (\"the rabbits fighting in the bag,\" as one colleague puts it) who are seen to be in line for the top jobs at Associated Newspapers. Talk of outsiders being parachuted into Derry Street is given scant credence: Dacre feels safest when he has been able to mould the most important players in his empire. Veronica Wadley at the London Evening Standard and Peter Wright at the Mail on Sunday are Dacre graduates - and they send out a strong message that the boss rewards handsomely those he rates. When the Daily Telegraph recently tried to recruit Steafel, Dacre promoted the man in charge of the Mail's news operation to joint deputy. Of the four golden boys, Steafel is easily the most popular; he is seen as having a strong sense of news but also a sense of humour. He does not ape Dacre's moral indignation, but has a shrewd vision of the suburbs as a rather less moral enclave than the Mail would like to think. Like Steafel, Clarke has recently been promoted - to associate editor. Clarke is also a newsman, but is regarded as neanderthal in his approach to colleagues, and \"too coarse to be a guest at one of Lady Rothermere's salons\", according to one. Verity enjoyed a rapid ascent through the features department. He is now running operations in Ireland. Finally, there is MacGregor, Wadley's number two at the London Evening Standard. Until recently, MacGregor was being groomed to take over from Wadley or Wright, but his pages at the Standard are regarded as somewhat lacklustre and lacking in imagination. Dacre knows he needs to keep his golden boys' expectations high: without the promise of promotion, not even the handsome Mail salaries and generous expenses can counter the punishing schedule expected of them. Their 12 hour-plus days (one Derry Street executive claims that instead of 9 to 5, he keeps a 5 to 9 schedule - 5am to 9pm) will include, during their career at the Mail, exposure to every aspect of the paper's operation: from news to features, from buy-ups to photos, from the sister paper in Ireland to the one in Scotland. \"This is like Sandhurst,\" says one seasoned Mail journalist. \"By the time Dacre has finished with their full training, these men will have experienced infantry, cavalry and every aspect of the army.\" (Not to mention verbal abuse by an editor with a drill sergeant's delight in public humiliation.) Whether in charge of features or the Ireland edition, Mail editors are a different breed from those who run other Fleet Street newspapers. Elsewhere, writers' copy is expected to meet the brief, and only rarely will their prose be knocked into shape; on the Mail, writers are there to get the dirt or hit the right pitch of sentiment (indignation, pathos, pride) - they can leave the writing to the editorial engineers at the hub of the Mail machine. Thus, the backroom comes to the fore. For some, Dacre is the last great Fleet Street editor, blessed with an unbeatable instinct for what his readers want to read, and how this should be presented; for others, he is a brutal taskmaster with an arrogant sense of destiny. For \"Dacre's golden boys\" he is all this and, more important, the kingmaker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
