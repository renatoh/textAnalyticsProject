I think it's when you see something particularly arresting or distinctive, where you feel that this photographer has a unique vision. It needs to be something that surprises you, or says something new, either about the subject or about photography itself. I look at so much every day, but you can see the work that is exceptional.\" Alex Majoli President, Magnum Photos \"After I've finished looking at an image, or a book of images, if I feel like I want to go out and take a picture, I know that the work is really good. It has nothing to do with aesthetics or the gimmickry of the picture \u2013 it's about the ability of the photographer to bring me to a place that I've never been before. And I think you should be able to stand in front of a picture and receive something without too much thinking. It should be as unintellectual as possible. It's not about the photographer.\" Hamish Crooks Ex-archive editor, Magnum \"In a single image, you're looking for a show stopper, a perfect combination of composition and content. I look for a photograph that encourages the same things: curiosity, excitement, titillation, repulsion or inspiration of some sort. You're trying to explain an overall perception of something in one picture, and it's got to do one of those things to me.\" Rawiya Rawiya is a photography collective founded by five female photographers from across the Middle East \"We look for a moment when something inner is revealed, often an image which would raise questions or provoke a reaction. There should be a balance between the aesthetic and informative elements, so the best pictures contain both the imaginative splendour of a painting and the reality of the world we live in. Human dignity must be respected even in the worst situations.\" Martin Barnes Senior curator of photographs, Victoria and Albert Museum \"Great photographs are like visual poetry. They neatly capture and express a situation or emotion that transcends the everyday. The most intriguing photographs do not overexplain. Though they brim with information, they also provoke a desire for knowledge, and seem to promise it, but ultimately they fall profoundly silent and still.\" Anna Kari Member of Documentography, an international collective of photographers \"Most often, the photographs that really touch me are documentary images that show the emotions of their subjects. I also look for perfect composition, of course, where light, colours and action come together. But those rare images that also give me a feeling of insight, freezing forever a moment in that person's life, are the ones that stay with me. It doesn't have to be something dramatic, maybe just the look between a mother and a child, or the joy of children playing.\" Hope Kingsley Curator of Seduced by Art at the National Gallery \"I don't automatically discount anything. Looking at an image, I always ask myself: were the means \u2013 the materials and the presentation \u2013 suitable to the photographer's purpose? When I'm teaching students, that is quite a helpful way to avoid preconceptions. I do think it's important to let the artist present something that is hopefully meaningful to them.\" Michael Hoppen Founder of the Michael Hoppen Gallery, London \"I look for things that have a timeless quality. Often, you get what I would call a sugar hit from something, but you have to stand back and see what's nibbling at you, because images should refresh themselves. It's just a gut instinct. I say to my clients, 'Go home, and if in the next few days you're still waking up in the morning, or you're in the middle of the park and the picture keeps coming back to you, it means it's got its talons into you, and it's more than a sugar hit. I look for pictures I cannot live without.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
