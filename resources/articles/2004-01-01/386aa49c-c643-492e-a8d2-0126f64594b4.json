Up until now, the answer has been entire distinct designer collections produced for those women loaded enough to require a wardrobe custom-created to see them through the long, languid, winter sun breaks they take each year. This will include pieces far too louche, unstructured, daring and dishevelled for day-to-day rich-person wear. Pieces whose sole purpose is to be thrown casually over bikinis to effect an effortless but chic transition between beach and club house. Pieces to be worn on yachts. Dressy evening swimwear. Beach jewellery. But now the good news. Resort wear is suddenly everyone's business as winter sun gets increasingly accessible with each passing year and the whole resort wear concept has begun merging with everyday dressing: witness Kate Moss, in her now signature kaftan and Ugg boot combination, working Resort on the streets of Primrose Hill in deepest Brit winter. Or the rise of Juicy Couture, whose towelling, tight-fitting, multi-coloured track suits have become the last word in resort crossover dressing, allowing you to look good but unflustered and like you're not trying too hard on long- haul flights to palm-strewn islands, and a fine way to do cool, leisurely weekend dressing at home. Now Resort is hitting the high-end high street, the hip little boutique, the contemporary department store concession. Pioneering the movement are Heidi Gosman and Penny Klein, who opened their west London resort wear emporium Heidi Klein after a fruitless mid-winter search for cool bikinis. They realised they'd found a gap in the market and opened their first store in spring 2002,selling exquisite bikini ranges at \u00a3100 apiece, elaborate beaded flip-flops from the posh hippie Havaianas range (\u00a328 a pair), sun visors and sequinned Aspara kaftans, Johnny Loves Rosie kitsch beach jewellery, and the very best - most insouciant yet cool - beach bags. Beauty therapist Amy Jones, a celebrity favourite, is in residence, and she and her staff offer decadent bikini waxes of the Brazilian variety for \u00a338, and the best faux tans from \u00a330. As testimony to the rise in resort wear, Heidi Klein has snared a famous fanbase, Elle Macpherson, Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, naturally, and Sadie Frost among them, and generally done phenomenal business. This March, Gosman and Klein launch their own-brand resort clothing collection and open a second London store on Sloane Square. Other labels, meanwhile, are gleefully exploiting the increased demand for year-round holiday capsule wardrobes. Nuala, the yoga line created by Christy Turlington and now co-owned by Puma, is effortlessly expanding into the territory with a selection of resort-essential kaftans and kimono tops. Juicy Couture's spectacular way with the luxe lounge look persists into 2004 as its track suits get more upscale, camp and Miami Beach fabulous with every passing season. (There's something incredibly compelling about owning an outfit that looks like it was purpose-designed to be worn en route to enjoying cocktails at dusk in an outdoor hot tub, possibly with diamante encrusted heels - and nobody does that like Juicy.) Danish label DAY Birger et Mikkelsen has produced a resort collection entitled Portofino Holiday, which, it explains, is all about taffeta and summer cashmere, capri pants, bell skirts, sensual fluid dresses and anything else that will adequately accessorise a suntan. As frivolous as resort wear is, there is also something rather healthy about it. It's rare that fashion doesn't take itself seriously, but resort wear never could. It's whole point is to be fun - and a little ridiculous. Just look at the normally very grown up Celine's early swimwear collection, featuring a red swimsuit slashed to the belly button at the front and embossed with a vast daisy. And the generally austere Michael Kors, whose focus piece for his resort collection for winter 2003 was a violently fuchsia full-length jersey dress. You get the feeling that resort wear is the opportunity for designers, tired of inventing interminably earnest collections, to fling back their heels and have a giggle. Accordingly, it's much more of a laugh to wear."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
