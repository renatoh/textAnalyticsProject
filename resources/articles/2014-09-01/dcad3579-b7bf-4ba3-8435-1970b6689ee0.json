In fact he didn\u2019t tackle The Creation until 2011, when he was 82. He approaches this great choral masterpiece with wit, unhurried grandeur, riveting orchestral detail and forward momentum \u2013 in short, with just the acuity he brings to anything he conducts. Based chiefly on the Old Testament book of Genesis and Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost, its three sections describe the creation of the heavenly bodies, the banishing of Satan and the invention of all living creatures, as narrated by three angels, Gabriel (soprano Camilla Tilling), Uriel (tenor Mark Padmore), and Raphael (bass Hanno M\u00fcller-Brachmann). Choir, orchestra and soloists are on sparkling form in this live recording \u2013 an invigorating reminder, if any were needed, of Haydn\u2019s genius."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
