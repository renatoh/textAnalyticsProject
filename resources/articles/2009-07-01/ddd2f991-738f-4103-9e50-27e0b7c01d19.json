Shortly before the big day I received a notice detailing the monthly income and my entitlement to tax-free cash. Three years later I have received a letter from Revenue &amp; Customs telling me that my pension provider, Sun Life of Canada, has informed them that the \"tax-free cash\" was an unauthorised payment and is subject to 40% tax. I have to pay \u00a31,045 in tax as it appears I received the cash after my birthday. I feel my pension provider has let me down badly over this. JE, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands You started talking to Sun Life of Canada during January 2006 to begin the process of having your pension paid from your 75th birthday on 27 May that year. That is plenty of time, even for pension providers. In mid-May you accepted the quotation and returned the documents although not, says Sun Life of Canada, the \"standard lifetime allowance\". That arrived on 26 May, still a day before your birthday, but the company did not pay you the lump sum until 22 June. Everyone in the pensions industry knows you must take your pension by your 75th birthday so there is no excuse for failing to rush through your payment or, when posting it a month after your birthday, realising this would cause a problem. The company had your documents in place before your birthday and blames a large volume of requests at that time for overlooking the consequences of the late cheque. It will now pay your tax bill for you. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
