The France international, who effectively replaced Diego Costa at Vicente Calder\u00f3n, has enjoyed a prolific season in Spain and is one of a number of potential recruits whose progress has been tracked closely. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho hopes to add three or four senior players to his Premier League champions in anticipation of losing Petr Cech, Filipe Lu\u00eds and Didier Drogba. The club\u2019s recruitment department, headed by the technical director Michael Emenalo, are hoping to conduct business as efficiently as last summer when their major additions \u2013 other than Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, whose transfer was necessitated by Fernando Torres\u2019s departure on deadline day \u2013 were secured relatively early. While they retain clout in the market, there could yet be one significant sale to offer Chelsea more leeway given the desire to comply with Uefa\u2019s financial fair play regulations. Griezmann has scored 25 goals for Atl\u00e9tico since his \u00a323m arrival from Real Sociedad last July on a six-year contract, though his club are attempting to renegotiate the terms of that arrangement given the current deal includes a buyout clause set at around \u00a343m. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s keenness to redraft Griezmann\u2019s contract reflects how well the 24-year-old has done in his first year under Diego Simeone but the clause as it stands offers suitors the chance to prise him away. Chelsea\u2019s summer dealings are likely to revolve heavily around Atl\u00e9tico, as they did a year ago when Costa and Filipe Lu\u00eds were bought and Thibaut Courtois ended a three-year loan spell in the Spanish capital. The Brazilian left-back may return to his former club having failed to make an impact this year, while there is interest in Toby Alderweireld \u2013 a versatile defender or midfielder who has enjoyed an excellent season on loan at Southampton and recently joined Jorge Mendes\u2019 stable of clients \u2013 the Spain international midfielder Koke and Barcelona\u2019s forward Pedro Rodr\u00edguez. The Premier League champions have also looked at the Getafe goalkeeper, Vicente Guaita, and retain an interest in Queens Park Rangers\u2019 Rob Green, who will become a free agent on 1 July, on the assumption Cech will end an 11-year spell at Stamford Bridge by seeking regular first-team football elsewhere this summer. The Czech international may favour remaining in London with Arsenal, though there is strong interest from abroad. Reports have also been compiled on Southampton\u2019s Morgan Schneiderlin and the England full-back Nathaniel Clyne, whose long-term future is in doubt at St Mary\u2019s. Initial interest in the Swiss left-back, Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez, at Wolfsburg is unlikely to be pursued. Regardless, there is an acceptance that reinforcements will be needed before a sterner test next term. \u201cOf course next season is going to be more difficult for us,\u201d Nemanja Matic said. \u201cEveryone knows we are champions, they will fight against us with more motivation. But we deserve that. We are Chelsea, and we know what we have to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
