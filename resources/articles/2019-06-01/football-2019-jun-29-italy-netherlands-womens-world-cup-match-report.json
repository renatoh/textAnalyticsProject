Before their Women\u2019s World Cup quarter-final against Italy they had never been this far at Fifa\u2019s showcase tournament. Indeed, France 2019 is only their second World Cup appearance, after they made their debut four years ago. Yet the European champions displayed no inexperience as they navigated a robust Italian test in Valenciennes to secure a historic semi-final spot. Second-half headers from Vivianne Miedema and Stefanie van der Gragt \u2013 the first goals Italy have conceded from open play this tournament \u2013 were too much for the Italians. \u201cThe word proud is more suitable than surprised,\u201d said the victorious coach, Sarina Wiegman. Miedema was more forthright. \u201cI did not expect to be in the semi-finals of this World Cup,\u201d she admitted. The all-European clash began in sweltering mid-afternoon conditions, as the heatwave gripping northern France refused to abate. Every other match in this round had been scheduled as an evening fixture but the Italians and the Dutch drew the short straw. The Royal Dutch Football Association even wrote to Fifa asking if the match could be delayed, to no avail. \u201cWe will feel the heat,\u201d joked Italy\u2019s manager, Milena Bertolini, on Friday. They did \u2013 via the baking sun and their dangerous opposition. From the opening whistle, Italy endured relentless waves of pressure as the Netherlands marauded forward. Yet the Italian defence stood firm, impervious to Dutch raids. Indeed it was Italy who had the first clearcut opportunity, with Milan\u2019s Valentina Bergamaschi scuffing a golden chance after 18 minutes. Replays indicated there may have been an earlier offside, continuing a trend that has seen four Italian goals disallowed at the tournament. But Bergamaschi\u2019s misplaced shot meant no VAR intervention was necessary. The opportunity swung momentum and soon Italy were ascendant. A water break on the half-hour gave the Dutch a short reprieve, although there was no rest for either set of travelling fans \u2013 a small Italian contingent remained in full-voice as they faced down a stadium full of orange-clad Dutch supporters. Fans of the Oranje have been a common sight throughout the World Cup but they were particularly numerous in Valenciennes; less than 150km from their homeland\u2019s southern border, the industrial French city temporarily felt like a Dutch exclave. The Netherlands began the second half as they had started the first, imposing themselves on Italy\u2019s back four but failing to find the right key to unlock it. The Dutch slowly intensified their pressure, Dani\u00eblle van de Donk at one stage curling a long-range effort against the bar. Tensions flared within both teams, mainly in the direction of the Uruguayan referee, Claudia Umpi\u00e9rrez, who dealt several yellow cards as the literal and figurative temperature increased. \u201cWhen you are tired, you lose your mind and start to make bad decisions,\u201d said Bertolini. At long last, after 70 minutes, a goal arrived. Sherida Spitse lofted a free-kick to Miedema, whose glancing header past Laura Giuliani\u2019s outstretched glove gave the Arsenal star her 61st national-team strike. Drenched with sweat, the Italians looked despondent as their miracle run to the quarter-finals at their first World Cup in two decades appeared over. The Italian\u2019s ill-discipline then confirmed their exit. They conceded another free-kick, this time on the corner of their own penalty area, and Spitse whipped in her second effort within 10 minutes. Van der Gragt connected with a powerful header, leaping for joy in the knowledge that she had put the Netherlands\u2019 progress beyond doubt. The Dutch celebrated joyously following Umpi\u00e9rrez\u2019s final whistle, in the stands and on the pitch. They now find themselves only two victories from World Cup triumph, a remarkable achievement four years after their tournament debut. The win also secures them a ticket to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. \u201cThat is a special feeling,\u201d said Miedema. \u201cI have wanted to play at the Olympics since I was young.\u201d Crestfallen Italy received a standing ovation before Bertolini gathered her players on the pitch for a final time. \u201cThere were tears,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dream is over.\u201d But the Italian football hall of fame inductee remained upbeat. \u201cI told them I was very proud of what they had achieved \u2013 they have allowed the public back home to fall in love with the game. We have done something extraordinary.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
