Oscar Whisky, meanwhile, hacked up in the Welsh Champion Hurdle at Ffos Las, suggesting he is ready to line up against his stablemate in the real thing at the Cheltenham Festival. Binocular was sent off at 1-10 to beat three horses, but came off the bridle before the final flight, at which point he still trailed his pacemaker, Ruthenoise, by a couple of lengths. The race was then handed to him when the leader made a hash of the last, though Binocular would surely have won in any case. \"He wasn't impressive at all,\" said Tony McCoy, who added that his mount had jumped to the left down the back straight. But Binocular put up a similarly uninspired performance in this race last year before hammering the Champion Hurdle field last March. In between, he had been whisked over to Ireland by his owner, JP McManus, where Binocular spent 10 days getting intensive examination and treatment from McManus's vets. There are no plans to do anything similar this time, according to Frank Berry, the owner's representative. Tom Symonds, Henderson's assistant, did his best to strike an upbeat note, saying: \"It looked like, before, he'll come on another step for that. The next step is to give him a bit of time and then crack on towards Cheltenham in March.\" Asked about Binocular's lack of sparkle, Symonds said: \"It's been well documented that he doesn't do an awful lot at home and he can be quite idle.\" Ladbrokes eased the reigning champion to 7-2 from 11-4 for the Festival race, while Oscar Whisky is a top price of 14-1, just a couple of points shorter than this morning. His Ffos Las success may have proved little but it did at least produce clarity as to his Cheltenham target, Henderson all but ruling out a tilt at the World Hurdle. \"I think we'll stick to the Champion Hurdle route,\" the trainer said. \"I wouldn't have thought he would go three miles. There's some improvement there, Barry [Geraghty] said he gave a blow. He'll come on a good bit and I think that [the Champion Hurdle] is what we will do.\" Alan King was evasive as to his Festival ambitions for Medermit, who held off Captain Chris to win the Scilly Isles Novice Chase here. The grey, whose jumping was much slicker than it had been at times earlier in the season, is entered in the Arkle and the Ryanair, as well as the new Grade Two for novices over two and a half miles. When it was put to King that his horse belonged in the Arkle, he replied: \"I think so, but there's no point in me saying one thing and then changing my mind, as I usually do. I'm not committing at the moment.\" This was the trainer's first Grade One success since Voy Por Ustedes won at Aintree in April 2009. Tomorrow's fascinating card at Leopardstown, featuring four Grade One races, is at risk of being abandoned because of waterlogging after 14mm of rain fell on the Irish course from Friday night into yesterday morning, with more forecast for last night. An official said the track remained raceable in the afternoon and could take \"another 10mm to 12mm\" but not much more. An inspection is due to take place at 7.30am. Soft or heavy going and three miles around an Irish racecourse are conditions that suit The Listener (3.45), who has won three Grade Ones in such circumstances and is a tempting 14-1 to gain his second success in the Hennessy Gold Cup. He had been on the sidelines for 13 months before the Lexus at Leopardstown's Christmas meeting, when he ran well before tiring.
