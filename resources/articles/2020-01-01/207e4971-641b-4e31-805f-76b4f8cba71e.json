But Tim Henman, their part-time muse, was quick to remind them in the immediate aftermath of losing 2-1 to Australia in the knockout stage of the first ATP Cup that their privilege and obligations as elite athletes should be guided by the scoreboard more than the heart \u2013 or, in Evans\u2019s case, his stomach. \u201cYeah, I think Evo could miss a few meals,\u201d Henman said with a laugh when reflecting on how Evans had to push himself to the limit of his endurance to beat the indefatigable Alex de Minaur 7-6 (4), 4-6, 7-6 (2), in three hours and 23 minutes, the longest match of the tournament, to keep the tie alive. Evans, who lost 11 months of his career to a drugs ban, has been the hero of the British campaign. His performance on Thursday was \u201cphenomenal\u201d, Henman said. And there should be more to come. A year ago, Evans was 189 in the world when pushing Roger Federer to two tie-breaks in the second round of the Australian Open; he will return to Melbourne on 20 January ranked 31 in the world \u2013 and inside the seedings boundary. \u201cThat\u2019s an obvious goal in slams,\u201d Henman said when told. \u201cThen, if he\u2019s going to be [inside] 32, he\u2019s got to be top 30; if he plays like that more often, he could be knocking on the door of top 20. He\u2019s doing a lot of good things. It\u2019s something that he and I have talked about. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go away and keep ticking a lot of boxes. The way that he played the match against [Belgium\u2019s David] Goffin, ranked 11, was very impressive. De Minaur, 18 \u2013 those are proper wins, world-class performances. \u201cIt\u2019s easier said than done, but his variation \u2013 to use the slice, the change of pace, hit the backhand down the line to open up the forehand to get forward, serving and volleying ... He\u2019s got options in his game and it\u2019s not always easy to choose the right ones. Today, that level of tennis was phenomenal, and it rates alongside any grand slam at any stage. For him to play well, I really wanted him to get the rewards he deserved in that match \u2013 and he did. It\u2019s a huge positive to take out of this.\u201d But Henman wants to see him reproduce that level more often. \u201cTo reach the standard is the easy bit, playing in this environment on an indoor court. It\u2019s harder when you\u2019re at a lesser event and it\u2019s windy. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve got to deliver. We know the level is incredibly high. He\u2019s got to keep building on that. It\u2019s a process day in, day out. His tennis skills, his physical skills are there, it\u2019s a challenge mentally. Now, with a bit more maturity, I think there are exciting times ahead for Dan.\u201d Surprisingly hauled back into the sport\u2019s mainstream by Andy Murray \u2013 who withdrew at the last minute to work on a stubborn groin strain - Henman drew on his own distinguished achievements as a player to bring a hard-headed pragmatism to the players\u2019 efforts, dramatically so in their farewell performance against the most obdurate of long-time sporting rivals. The agony of Jamie Murray and Salisbury losing the deciding doubles to De Minaur and Nick Kyrgios should not diminish Evans\u2019s achievement against the world No 18, Henman said. Murray blew the easiest of their four match points in the 30-minute tie-break that would have put them through to Saturday\u2019s semi-finals against either Belgium or Spain, and spoke honestly about it afterwards. \u201cI missed that shot basically on top of the net, which was ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played a good first set, and then let them back into it with a soft break at the start of the second set. Got the break back. Again, gave away a break. All of a sudden it\u2019s a tie-break and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game. But that will hurt. Should have never missed that shot. I\u2019ll probably never miss it again in my career. That cost us.\u201d Henman, who will return to his board duties at the All England Club \u2013 and his beloved golf \u2013 is guardedly optimistic about the future of British tennis. \u201cActions speak louder than words,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can talk about it until we\u2019re blue in the face. \u201cWith Evo, we knew the gameplan and he did it exceptionally well. But it\u2019s not just about Evo. It\u2019s about Cam, it\u2019s about Kyle [Edmund], it\u2019s about the young ones, it\u2019s about the girls. They know what they\u2019ve got to do. They\u2019ve got to continue to go out and do it. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite there by any stretch of the imagination. You need more strength in depth \u2013 like Spain, France. But there\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s core groups on the Tour now, which is good, who can push each other a lot. I like what I see with Jack Draper. The boys were practising with [Anton] Matusevich. There\u2019s a lot of positive things there. \u201cLikewise on the ladies\u2019 side. If you can get the healthy competition, with the girls pushing each other, I think that\u2019s good. Davis Cup at the end of last year, we put in a strong performance here. We\u2019ve seen Fed Cup, some pretty impressive matches. So we have to try to maintain that momentum. At the top of the game, that\u2019s always an important area. \u201cWe still the need the younger ones coming through in the juniors. I\u2019m always on the end of the phone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
