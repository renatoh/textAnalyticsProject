The events are usually held about a week apart but because of the early Easter (31 March), the two gatherings coincide and, even by Palm Springs' standards, this will mean the desert city will be beyond camp for the holiday. Up to 30,000 gay and lesbian hedonists are expected to descend on the town for the discos, pool parties charity dinners... and much more. The Palm Springs Board of Tourism warns that already the large resort hotels are booked for the Friday and Saturday. Some have Thursday and Sunday availability, but those will soon be snapped up, too. The party-planners for the gay and lesbian weekends have block-booked hotels in the area. Girl Bar/Skirts has booked Riviera resort in Palm Springs (00 1 760 327 8311) and the Doral Resort in Cathedral City (00 1 760 322 7000). For the men, JS Enterprises has block-booked three hotels in Palm Springs; Wyndham (00 1 760 322 6000), the Marquis (00 1 760 322 2121) and the Hilton (00 1 760 320 6868). For details of weekend packages and special rates, visit www.girlbar.com, www.clubskirts.com or www.jeffreysanker.com. There are smaller groups organising events and accommodation, such as the sports-oriented Women on a Roll and the Lina Shore Golf Classic, whose members generally like to attend the Nabisco women's golf tournament after which the Dinah Shore weekend was originally named. The tournament is to be held on 28-31 March. Palm Springs, 120 miles east of Los Angeles in the Coachella Valley, is the major West Coast draw for gay and lesbian travellers after San Francisco and LA. All the gay and lesbian-owned small bungalow hotels, for which it is famed and where you can sunbathe topless or naked, were fully booked a year ago for Easter. But just in case they have cancellations, log on to www.palm-springs.org, where you will be directed to gay accommodations.
