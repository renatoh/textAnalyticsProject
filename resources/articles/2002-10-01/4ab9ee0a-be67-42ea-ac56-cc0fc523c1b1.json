It could only handle primitive colour schemes and even then its yellow was dodgy. A drawing printed on February 16 1896 tested a new process for this tricky colour. Entitled The Great Dog Show in M'Googan Avenue, this cartoon by Richard Outcault depicted an urban doggy scene of scruffy mongrels and manky owners. In the centre was a bald, big-eared toddler clad in a nightshirt - a lurid yellow nightshirt. The Yellow Kid was such a hit that rival newspaper proprietor, William Randolph \"Citizen Kane\" Hearst poached Outcault for the launch of a comic supplement in his New York Journal. On October 24, the Journal featured The Yellow Kid Takes a Hand at Golf, with several panels depicting the little ragamuffin's wobbly attempts to wallop the ball. This was the first newspaper comic strip. Pow! Pulitzer hit back. He made Outcault a higher offer and the kid appeared again in the World - until Hearst and his chequebook poached the cartoonist back for the Journal. At this point Pulitzer \"kidnapped\" the kid by getting someone else to draw him, whereupon Outcault moved on to yet another newspaper to draw a completely different strip. This battle of the gutter press over a guttersnipe gave birth to the newspaper strip cartoon - and the phrase \"yellow journalism\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
