The room is heavy with anxiety and everyone is on edge unable to breath with much ease. I hold the hand next to me tightly as the room is fed the results \u2013 61.6% yes \u2013 we all erupt with tears, hugs and cheers. We\u2019d just spent the past few years battling the government to stop them from taking our right to marry to the polls and when we finally thought we\u2019d won it was ripped away with this non-binding postal survey. Despite the defeat, as always, we got back up and spent the months leading up to 15 November having constant conversations, rallying, calling strangers and family members and watching on as the far right were given a platform to exercise their \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d, which ultimately did damage to so many of us in the community. But while I attended the rallies, had the conversations and watched the hate unfold, I was harbouring what I felt was a dirty secret: I was a fraud. At that same time as the country was debating gay marriage, my \u201cwife\u201d of three years and partner of eight and I were going through our gay divorce. Despite this, it was empowering to be a part of the fight and it felt like I was at least doing something to help the cause. But the entire time I felt so guilty. How could I be fighting for the right to enter an institution that I was leaving? I felt like I\u2019d let the community down and at the time I didn\u2019t make my voice as loud as I would have liked to. My muted voice was for fear that those within and outside of the community would feel that I\u2019d just added to the reasons for the no vote. Divorce in any community is often seen, or at least feels when you\u2019re experiencing it, as a failure. However, I felt extra pressure that I suspect others in the queer community feel to show that a same-sex marriage, legal or otherwise, would last. With such a spotlight on the community especially during the plebiscite, there\u2019s a sense that any wrong move is a chalk mark in the \u201ccons\u201d column for the rights of LGBTQI+ people and there feels like no bigger con mark than a failed marriage. When I first was married I found it difficult to talk about it to colleagues and strangers, for fear that they would tune out thinking \u201cit\u2019s not a real marriage\u201d since it wasn\u2019t yet legal in Australia. Then I felt I couldn\u2019t talk about it as marriage equality became closer because the relationship had ended. While all my partnered friends were taking to social media sharing their stories of love and using these personal anecdotes to help sway voters, for the first time in eight years I felt as though I couldn\u2019t contribute. It was a strange identity loss that I hadn\u2019t expected to be amplified through the plebiscite campaign. No longer could I share the incredible photos of me looking handsome in a tailored suit and my bride looking beautiful in her white gown as proof that \u201clove exists\u201d. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing stories of the previous eight years, from falling in love with my roommate, to moving states together and enduring all the hardships that couples go through over the years only to come out victorious through it all. I could only sit in silence through the conversations hoping no one who knew would bring it up. On reflection though, why couldn\u2019t I have these conversations or share these photos and memories? After all, heterosexuals have been divorcing since the 1500s. Why was my story of gay divorce not one to share during this time? My wife had rejected my suggestion to get \u201creal married\u201d during our honeymoon in Hawaii, so we ended up not having to go through a \u201creal divorce\u201d, but many people weren\u2019t so lucky. Since the Marriage Act was redefined to be \u201cthe union of two people to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life\u201d, while a lot of queer people and allies have been celebrating the right to marry, I\u2019m finding myself thinking more about a right we didn\u2019t talk much about: the right to divorce. Going through a breakup is hard enough but imagine knowing or maybe finding out through the process, that you\u2019re stuck in a legal loophole. For all those couples rejoicing the fact that their overseas marriages to their same-sex partner were finally being recognised at home, there were those celebrating the recognition of divorce. Had we married in Hawaii we\u2019d have a situation where we\u2019d have split up and then had our marriage legally recognised by the change in laws in Australia and been forced through a formal divorce. The thought of being legally married after a split is distressing but it\u2019s something that many couples would have gone through. As the people I went to high school with, teachers, old colleagues and many others who were silent all those years ago when I came out started changing their Facebook picture frames to a rainbow \u201cVote Yes\u201d image and shared positive articles about gay marriage or horrific stories of queer people being treated poorly by businesses in the wedding industry, it felt particularly important to prove that they\u2019d chosen the right side. I never expected to be someone to get married in the first place, so it came as a shock to me when on the cusp of 24 I found myself proposing to my long-term girlfriend. There was so much vocal celebration for our engagement and even more so at, and after, the wedding. Yet the decision I made to split up, just months before my 29th birthday, would ultimately be the best one I\u2019d make for myself and my relationship, and no one celebrated. There were no congratulations on the divorce, no divorce parties where my friends could contribute to pay for half the shit I\u2019d just lost. I had some quiet conversations with my best friend who was proud of my decision. And it took a year, but I finally got \u201cgood at being single\u201d. I\u2019ve never been happier and I make a point of saying this regularly, not because I need to convince myself but I feel like I need to convince those around me. I\u2019ve come to new realisations about marriage equality. When I was first fighting for it, making creative signs for rallies that said things like \u201cYou can marry your cousin, but I can\u2019t marry my girlfriend?\u201d and \u201cLegalise gay marriage \u2026 my arms are sore\u201d, I was doing it for the very selfish and personal reason of my desire to get married. I wanted what my heterosexual peers had. I wanted to wear my wedding ring with pride, share the photos of the big day and have water cooler conversations about the things \u201cmy wife\u201d did that made me proud, all without wondering if they were thinking \u201cyeah it\u2019s not real though, is it?\u201d Since the divorce, the right to marry has taken on a whole new meaning for me. One that those fighting for my rights had no doubt been thinking about all along. It\u2019s not about the right to get married. It\u2019s not even really about the right to get divorced. It\u2019s about the right. The human right to be treated the same as anyone else. The right to have the option.
