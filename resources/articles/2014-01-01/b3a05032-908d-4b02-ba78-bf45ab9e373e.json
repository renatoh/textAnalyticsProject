That's hardly surprising, given that within three years of becoming an MP in 1992, Mr Wicks had guided his Carers Act on to the statute book, giving rights to people who have to look after family members. Now, in a posthumous memoir, he has revealed another reason. You have to be in your 50s or more to recall the 1976 row when the Callaghan government tried to postpone the introduction of child benefit. But when a civil servant leaked cabinet papers on the issue to Frank Field, then of Child Poverty Action Group, who published them in New Society magazine, the resulting scandal ensured the benefit went ahead. That civil servant, it now transpires, was Mr Wicks. Millions owe him a debt of gratitude for his ethical whistle-blowing \u2013 and for the long commitment to ethical politics that followed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
