Mark Sahady is the principal organizer, under the moniker Super Happy Fun America. He has previously organized and attended events, some of which have turned violent, as the leader of the Boston chapter of a group called Resist Marxism. The Daily Beast described the new organization as a \u201cfront for [the] far-right group\u201d. Events organized by Sahady in Boston have often been small, with attendees vastly outnumbered by opposing groups. In the immediate aftermath of the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, during which a counter-protester was killed, a Free Speech Rally in Boston saw attendees outnumbered by tens of thousands of opponents. A Rally for the Republic was similarly small-scale, as was a counter-protest to a pro-gun control March for Our Lives event. In 2018, Think Progress reported that Resist Marxism had links with white nationalist groups, and that members had expressed antisemitic sentiments in leaked chats. Among the events Sahady has traveled to nationwide in recent years was a June 2018 event in Portland, Oregon, that was organized by Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson and which degenerated into extreme violence, declared a riot by Portland police. Resist Marxism was founded by Kyle Chapman, better known as \u201cBased Stickman\u201d since footage of him brawling with antifascists in Berkeley \u2013 complete with armor and a club \u2013 made him a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on the far right in 2017. A convicted felon, Chapman is awaiting trial on charges of carrying a leaded stick into a pro-Trump rally in March. He also faces felony assault charges in Texas. Chapman has been celebrating media attention to the straight pride parade on his account on Telegram, an instant messaging platform which has become popular among rightwing figures such as Gavin McInnes, Milo Yiannopoulos and the Proud Boys who have been banned from more mainstream social media. Linking to a New York Times story, Chapman wrote to his 600 followers: \u201cThe New York Times has picked up this story as well. Thanks for the free advertising NYT!\u201d Later, linking to a T-shirt for sale on a Proud Boys-linked online store featuring the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s great to be straight\u201d, Chapman wrote: \u201cDo I hear triggered leftists? Order now and watch them melt down! #StraightPrideParade.\u201d Chapman has also inflated several white nationalist talking points, claiming \u201cwhite genocide is in full swing in South Africa\u201d and decrying Florida laws against antisemitic discrimination, writing: \u201cAntisemitism laws are cropping up all over the country. Most of you cucks are afraid of saying anything for fear of being called antisemitic.\u201d Boston\u2019s mayor, Marty Walsh, said no permit had yet been issued for the Straight Pride Parade but wrote on Twitter: \u201cPermits to host a public event are granted based on operational feasibility, not based on values or endorsements of beliefs.\u201d Walsh added: \u201cThe city of Boston cannot deny a permit based on an organization\u2019s values.\u201d Parade organizers announced that Yiannopoulos would act as the \u201cmascot and Grand Marshall\u201d. Yiannopoulos \u2013 exiled from US conservative circles after comments about pedophilia, widely banned from social media and revealed last year by the Guardian to be in deep debt \u2013 has begun promoting the event on his own Telegram channel. Yiannopoulos, who is gay, wrote: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you Boston, it\u2019s great to be straight.\u201d Organizers of the straight pride parade did not immediately respond to requests for comment. David Neiwert, author of Alt America and a longtime observer of the US far right, believes the march is primarily opportunistic. For the Daily Kos, he described Sahady as a \u201cstreet brawler\u201d with \u201ca history \u2026 of organizing violent events\u201d. Neiwert told the Guardian: \u201cWhat we know about these street-fighting gangs is that they latch on to whatever they can in order to go out and fight with the left.\u201d He added: \u201cIn this case it\u2019s so utterly juvenile that it\u2019s like a sixth-grade taunt.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
