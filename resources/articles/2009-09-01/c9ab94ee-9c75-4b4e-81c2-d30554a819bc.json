No writ yet, we hear but tensions understandably run high: no one likes to be depicted as fruit. But it is all just as interesting in the Labour camp, for this week national officials are expected to travel to the north-west to pass judgment on seven party members who might well be thrown out of the party for the crime of being disloyal. Six of the seven say they are being hauled before the national constitutional committee because they signed a letter to the Rochdale Observer rebutting claims in that same paper from Mr Danczuk that his own party members were bandying false accusations and \"bullying\". A seventh is apparently in trouble for comments posted online. The party is saying little, save for the fact that it is considering events there and cannot comment further \u2013 but none of it looks good as we seek to close the chasm between politicians and the public. In this atmosphere, being called a banana doesn't seem too bad. How best to describe the relationship between Gordon and the fizzball that is Lord Mandelson? Many have tried. The latest Public Servant magazine, beloved of civil servants, has a go. \"Mandelson \u2013 high on a hill with Gordon the goatherd,\" it says. \"He has become Labour's big beast. His intervention has saved the PM's hide: the claws are still sharp; his coat the glossiest of all in this particular menagerie.\" The message is clear. Hope the goatherd has a thick skin. Good that David Cameron moved to cut the link between his party and the notoriously unpleasant rightwing Monday Club. Bad that even now it styles itself the Conservative Monday Club and can be found on conservativeuk.com. The kind of confusion that does no good, as evidenced by this, a communication to us from group mainstay Gregory Lauder-Frost. \"Do we have to compensate 'developing' countries for anything whatsoever?\" he writes. If only these people had clung to empire. For they \"said they could do it. We knew they couldn't, of course. So no more money, aid, or sacrifices by us\". Doubtless the official Tory view on aid is slightly different. With what might one enthuse the business type who has everything, apart from company shares and a bonus? Times change, tastes change. Perhaps one factor is geographical. At last week's north-east CBI annual dinner, the top raffle prize, which was promptly re-donated to charity, was a laptop. The second prize, which the winners kept, was two \u00a350 vouchers valid at Greggs, the bakers. Particularly popular in the north, we hear. All those doughnuts, pies and macaroons. Finally, thanks to our friends at Raw Nerve Books here are some things we have learned about the human rights activist Peter Tatchell. The apology they have just agreed with him is so exhaustive we hardly know where to start. But we can tell you that Tatchell (pictured) has \"never claimed the role of liberator\" for Muslim gays and lesbians, isn't racist, hasn't described \"Muslims as Nazis\", never \"collaborated with the extreme right\", never \"participated with several racist and fascist groups\". He has never \"employed tactics of intimidation\", slung \"mud on to Muslim communities\". A condemnatory letter about him \"resulted from untrue gossip\", the result of a \"sectarian political vendetta\". Indeed he was, the apology tells us, one of the first to reject a \"western-centred approach to LGBT human rights\", and has only ever criticised the \"fundamentalists\" of all faiths. He has \"a long history of anti-racism dating back to the 1970s\", and has \"campaigned against imperialism for more than 40 years\". Fans, according to this, the mother of all climbdowns, include Thabo Mbeki and Jose Ramos-Horta, the president of East Timor. There's more, but what do you know, we have run right out of space. He's no saint \u2013 but on this basis he can't be far off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
