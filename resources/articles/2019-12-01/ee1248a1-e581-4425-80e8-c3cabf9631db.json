Mourinho is likely to face a fierce reception from the away end when Tottenham host his old side on Sunday and Lampard believes his former manager\u2019s decision to join one of Chelsea\u2019s fiercest rivals may not be forgiven by fans. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap and a half as a question, that,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cI can see the headline now, agreeing with the fans or not. If you go to the fiercest rivals, the fans will give the answer. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve forgotten the history or don\u2019t respect it. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is a manager who wants to work. He took that opportunity.\u201d Lampard, who played under Mourinho across the manager\u2019s two spells at Chelsea, believes the Portuguese will brush off any taunts from the stands. \u201cJos\u00e9 won\u2019t be too concerned about that,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the times he\u2019s come back with Manchester United. It did look like he doesn\u2019t care.\u201d Lampard led Derby County to a Carabao Cup victory over Mourinho\u2019s Manchester United last season and admits he is on first-name terms with his old boss now. \u201cI would always have big respect for all my managers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was to text or ring a manager, I\u2019d always call them boss or gaffer. Even long gone. \u201cWhen you go up against someone like that, influential, I knew it was different. It was a good honour to go up against him but I wanted to beat him. It would be strange to call him boss now. Now I am an ex-player, on this side of the fence, I won\u2019t be calling him boss. But that doesn\u2019t take away from the respect I have for him. \u201cThe problem with this is it\u2019s not the me and Jos\u00e9 show. It\u2019s a game against Tottenham. I want to beat him. I respect him and know what a top manager he is. He wants to beat me because he used to manage Chelsea, he used to manage me, and now he\u2019s managing Tottenham and wants to beat us.\u201d Tammy Abraham has told Chelsea that he wants to become one of their highest earners during talks over a new deal. The striker will have two years left on his deal at the end of the season and the Stamford Bridge club intended to offer a five-year contract worth \u00a3100,000 a week. However progress has been slow since talks began in September and it is understood that Abraham, who has scored 13 goals in all competitions this season, has adjusted his expectations since Callum Hudson-Odoi signed a new deal worth \u00a3120,000 a week. Abraham believes he deserves more than Hudson-Odoi, who has dipped in and out of form since returning from a serious achilles injury. Abraham does not have as much leverage as Hudson-Odoi, who was in danger of running down his contract and a target for Bayern Munich. However, the expectation is that Chelsea will improve their initial offer to Abraham, who has become one of Lampard\u2019s most important players. They are keen to tie down their academy products and are in talks with Reece James over a new deal. The promising 20-year-old right-back will also have two years left on his contract at the end of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
