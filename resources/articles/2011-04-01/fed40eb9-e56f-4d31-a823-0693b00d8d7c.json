In more ways than one", "bodyText": "The competition for worst movie of the year is at its fiercest, oddly, in the first months of the year \u2013 that post-Christmas graveyard of shelved and botched movies, a dumping ground for backfired investments and projects. Disgraced, orphaned and despised, spring releases run headlong for the shadows in shame, like cockroaches, oblivion their only destination, a Golden Razzie their only acclamation. So step up, The Roommate \u2013 a wan, college-based nightmare about getting dormitoried up with a complete stranger who turns out to be a jealous, possibly bi-curious, certainly bi-furious psychopath \u2013 now a sterling contender for that worst picture Razzie in 2012. In addition to being an airless and sinewless exercise in how not to manufacture suspense, delineate relationships or surprise an audience even once, Roommates shows the bottoming out of a trend that goes back to Fatal Attraction and Single White Female. The latter is the film it most grievously mimics: how long till the weird chick starts dressing exactly like the normal chick? Shall we see doppelgangers shirtless come lights-out? It lacks the courage of its convictions to truly match its inspiration (except in its latent misogyny), and it's trapped in meekness and mealy-mouthedness by its youth-hungry PG-13 rating (also known as the Teenager's No-Thrills-Guarantee). Casting one's mind back a bit, it's as though one can map a passage across the last 20 years using every stupid little stalker thriller as a milestone, and create an unbroken line that would rise no higher in quality or inspiration than The Roommate. None of them were campy or deliciously ultraviolent, and on most occasions they kill the careers of their stars: it's a graveyard of ing\u00e9nues, too. Remember Swimfan? Well no, but nor does anyone else, yet its tale of Erika Christiansen stalking Jesse Bradford, the hot boy on the school swim team, is the stuff that 5% ratings on RottenTomatoes.com are made of. Ditto The In-Crowd, the low-point of director Mary Lambert's interesting career: again with the torrid-cooped-up-college-girls-in-heat-with-lesbian-motifs set-up \u2013 and not a scintilla of sisterliness, as usual. Or New Best Friend, in a similar scenario, with interchangeable bimbos (a surprising number of these movies feature Dominique Swain or Busy Phillips). The daddy of the baddies (that is, if you think Single White Female and Fatal Attraction are good movies by comparison, which I don't) is The Temp, with that ghastly fraying mantis, Lara Flynn Boyle, stalking her fool of a boss Timothy Hutton. I'm not against women-in-peril movies; I'm just against them when they're stupid and insulting. Richard Fleischer's Blind Terror, Jenny Agutter in I Start Counting, hell, The Perils of Pauline \u2026 it's an honourable tradition, old as cinema, currently being done to death.
