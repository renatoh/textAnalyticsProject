The vocals, somehow reminiscent of both native American chants and Indian classical music, take some getting used to. In fact, on the jerky, spartan Dolgematki, they are absolutely maddening - but Adjagas's musical language is international. You can hear traces of Sigur Ros's wintry sparkle, Air's rippling warmth and the narcoleptic mantras of Mazzy Star, relocated from the desert to the Arctic tundra. On tracks such as Siivu and Ozan, the dialogue between ancient and modern, known and unknown, is spellbinding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
