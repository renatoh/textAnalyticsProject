It is not safe'", "bodyText": "Amid the plethora of essays in the catalogue for Zanele Muholi\u2019s forthcoming retrospective at Tate Modern, there is a moving testimony by Lungile Dladla, a South African lesbian. Entitled I Am Not a Victim but a Victor, it recounts how, on an evening in February 2010, she and a friend were accosted by an armed stranger, who ushered them into a field and ordered them to lie face down with their hands behind their backs. \u201cWe did as told,\u201d she writes, \u201cbecause we feared for our lives as he had a gun in his hand and threatened to use it if we did not do as he said. He undressed us and said, \u2018Today ngizoni khipha ubutabane.\u2019\u201d (\u201cToday I will rid you of this gayness.\u201d) What follows is a visceral account of a particular kind of violent sexual assault that its male perpetrators call \u201ccorrective rape\u201d. In this instance, as with many similar attacks in South Africa, the local police did not instigate a proper investigation. A year later, when the suspect was finally arrested, he was charged with 17 cases of rape. Soon afterwards, Dladla was diagnosed HIV-positive and hospitalised for two months with a near-fatal bout of pneumonia. \u201cOne thing I still need to overcome,\u201d she concludes, \u201cis the fact that whenever I take my medication, I am reminded of what the bastard did to me! However, my inner self is strong, I am going to beat this. HIV is not my life, I\u2019m not going to let it get to me. I am not a victim but a victor.\u201d Dladla\u2019s story is a stark reminder of what is at stake for members of the LGBTQ+ community in South Africa, whose rights are enshrined in the constitution, but whose lives are nevertheless marked by exclusion and persecution. Her testimony cuts to the very heart of Muholi\u2019s work as an activist-artist whose central project, the epic series Faces and Phases, is an ongoing archive of the lives and personal histories of lesbians, gender-nonconforming individuals and trans men, who have often been marginalised by injustice and oppression. Muholi, who identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, is immersed in that community and makes work from within that reflects its struggles and its resilience, but also its increasing visibility and self-empowering sense of community. \u201cActivism is part of my life,\u201d the artist tells me, matter-of-factly. \u201cWe have gone through so much as human beings, that it has forced so many of us to become activists \u2013 those who have survived racism, who have survived hate crimes, who have survived displacement of many kinds. It is ongoing and one cannot take a break or relax or just be. One cannot just ignore one\u2019s responsibilities.\u201d For that very reason, Muholi\u2019s extraordinary body of work possesses a powerful political and cultural resonance. The images have a presence that is palpable, but difficult to describe: a complex undercurrent of intimacy and defiance. Faces and Phases is both testimony and archive, the portraits accompanied by personal statements that speak of struggle, but also self-composure and pride. It is, as Sarah Allen, co-curator of the Tate Modern exhibition, notes \u201ca family album writ large, and a homage to both the individual and the collective.\u201d I ask Muholi, who is on a six-hour drive across South Africa with their studio manager when we speak, if they had any idea what it would become when they began the project in 2016. \u201cNot really,\u201d comes the reply. \u201cI did it out of necessity because it was needed \u2013 we didn\u2019t have something like it. I started small with maybe 20 photos and just kept going. And it will continue as long as there are people who agree to participate.\u201d As time passes, I suggest, the earlier portraits have inevitably become more resonant, both in terms of individual and collective history. \u201cYes. People move on, they change, they marry, they transition. Some survive, some we lose. These are the phases we refer to in the title.\u201d Born in Durban in 1972, Muholi grew up under apartheid, the youngest of eight children. Their father died when they were young, and their mother, Bester Muholi, a domestic worker, toiled long hours to support the family. In the catalogue interview Muholi pays homage to Bester\u2019s \u201cstrength, her courage and her resilience\u201d. When Muholi initially turned to photography it was a kind of self-healing and a way of dealing with their own personal struggles. \u201cI was going through a rough period and, when I started photographing, it became better. I discovered that the camera was a tool through which I could speak about whatever was inside \u2013 the feelings, the pain, the personal experiences I had gone through. I discovered that photography was a means of articulation.\u201d In 2002, Muholi began documenting the victims of hate crimes in South Africa for what would become the photographer\u2019s first series, Only Half the Picture. The images became the basis of a solo show at Johannesburg Art Gallery in 2004. In direct contrast, the ensuing project, Being, comprised casually intimate and sometimes languorously sensual portraits of of black lesbians. And yet, even that everydayness betokened a complex reality. \u201cJust existing daily is political in itself,\u201d says Muholi, \u201cand visibility also has its own politic especially for those in a space where some people are regarded as deviants. You are told you can exist, but at the same time there is this violence which also exists as a constant threat that denies you the right to be who you are, or who you want to be.\u201d Between making the two series, Muholi attended the Market Photo Workshop in Johannesburg, where its founder, David Goldblatt, the great visual chronicler of apartheid-era South Africa, was an important early mentor. \u201cThat is when my photography was fine-tuned and moulded to become what it is,\u201d elaborates Muholi. \u201cI learned to formalise what I was already working on and it also provided a space to engage with other photographers. Through engagement, your way of working changes.\u201d Muholi began Faces and Phases in 2006. The project characterises the artist\u2019s collaborative approach to their subjects. \u201cIt is the way one communicates with the participants in the work that is important,\u201d they tell me. \u201cFor instance, when I am photographing people I have worked with for a long time, there is no fear. When we produce the work, we talk, we communicate, we speak to each other as colleagues, friends, as friends of friends. That is what makes it different.\u201d At other times, when photographing those who are potential targets for hate crimes because of their visibility as activists or simply as individuals freely expressing their identities, Muholi has to tread carefully. \u201cThis is a community in which people are risking their lives. So, when we are dealing with subject matter that is risky to report on, you try to be as careful as possible, because it is complex: you do not want to provoke perpetrators as you are working, or to put people in danger by how you produce these works. You have to make very sure you keep safe at all times, but also you need to advise the many people that you work with, and that you are related to, to also be on the alert constantly.\u201d Has Muholi felt personally threatened or at risk when working? \u201cWell, I do not dare shoot at night, because I know that the night is not safe for many people. And I don\u2019t photograph parties, because I have to think of how I get home afterwards. It is not supposed to be like that, of course, but one has to be super-careful when producing this work. The safer we do it, the better. Survival is the order of the day.\u201d In 2012, Muholi began turning the camera on themself for a series of vividly expressive self-portraits called Somnyama Ngonyama (\u201cHail the Dark Lioness\u201d). Using whatever materials were at hand, they reference the history and symbolism of black African women throughout history as well as Muholi\u2019s own journey \u2013 the series is dedicated to their mother. Why the decision to photograph themself? \u201cIt was needed. We can get up caught up in the world without ever looking at ourselves.\u201d Many of the self-portraits were made in hotel rooms in Paris, London and other European cities in the immediate wake of dismaying encounters with hostile officialdom. They are layered in meaning, both personal and metaphorical. \u201cI have been to so many places and crossed so many borders, where you have the experience of being treated or questioned as if you are a subject. It is always different but there is always the feeling of being confined or displaced in a space where you are supposed to feel welcome. This is when you suddenly think of yourself as the other.\u201d The self-portraits range in tone from the playful to the provocative, but evince a sense of defiance that remains undimmed. I ask Muholi, in conclusion, if they ever succumb to pessimism. A pause. \u201cSometimes, yes. That is when the fear slows me down and I don\u2019t feel like carrying on, but always something in the back of my mind says, \u2018Carry on.\u2019\u201d Zanele Muholi is at Tate Modern, London, until 6 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
