Of course, the betting sites are shifting some of the blame to the banks, which issue the bank cards to the youngsters in the first place. However, the most interesting thing about the report has to be the way it was carried out. It was researched by a 16-year old called Ruby Carr, who happens to be the daughter of NCH's internet adviser John Carr. What Diary wants to know is, was young Ruby paid for this research? We're all for Victorian values but the NCH doesn't want to succeed in ending under-age gambling while reintroducing unpaid labour. \u00b7 Real Networks' decision to unveil its Harmony software, which will allow punters to download songs from its online music store and then play them on iPods, is not thought to have gone down too well with Apple. It's accused Real of \"adopting the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the iPod\". Strong stuff. Of course before now the only music you could play on iPods has been tracks bought on Apple's iTunes or ripped from your own CDs. Real has done this without asking Apple's permission after being refused licensing talks in the past. But according to Sean Ryan, Real VP of music services, his company is on \"rock solid\" legal grounds. Real says their move will only help Apple sell more iPods - and help Real sell more music. \u00b7 And staying with iTunes, many pundits who have long believed that the mobile phone is the natural home for digital music - and not just for dastardly ringtones - would have been pleased to hear of the iTunes/Motorola tie-up which would allow music bought online to be played on the phone. But analysts are already warning that mobile operators, all of whom have big mobile music ambitions with 3G phones, would not look too kindly on a system which effectively bypasses their expensively acquired networks. Of course, since operators are usually responsible for the success or failure of a handset by way of discount packages etc, Diary is betting that such iTunes-compatible phones might have a limited distribution at your local phone shop when they launch. \u00b7 Online advertising sales are rocketing on both sides of the Atlantic. But as ever with internet polling or measurement, the figures are either too early or they're too late. This week those crystal-ball gazers at Jupiter Research predicted that online advertising will hit $16bn (\u00a38.8bn) by 2009 in the US. While IAB UK revealed for the first time that online ad sales hit an impressive high of \u00a3353.6m in 2003, seven months after the event. So there you are, the fastest growing, most rapidly evolving and most measurable medium ever and yet nobody can seem to tell you how sales are doing from quarter to quarter. \u00b7 Yinka Adegoke is deputy editor of New Media Age"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
