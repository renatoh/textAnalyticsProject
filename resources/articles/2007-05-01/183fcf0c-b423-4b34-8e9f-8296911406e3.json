No players were mentioned by name, though some suggested that Mourinho was hinting at Cristiano Ronaldo. Given Chelsea's employment of Arjen Robben, Didier Drogba and Joe Cole, it might be considered unwise for Mourinho to highlight the subject. But Chelsea's manager said he hoped to play a part in seeing a \"national cultural event\" become \"a sporting event to remember\". \"Everybody has a responsibility,\" he said, \"and the people in the stands will do their job. Chelsea gave a lesson [in behaviour] in how to lose the Premiership crown. We did everything to try to win it, the way we fought to delay [United] winning it. Saturday's game should be correct; I'd be disappointed if there are players diving, provocating, trying to get others red cards.\" He then directed praise towards the FA Cup final referee, Steve Bennett, whom he said is \"discreet and low-profile - the best quality a referee can have. He needs help from me, Sir Alex and the players.\" The manager said Ashley Cole may start \"but I have my doubts about 90 minutes. Ashley or [Wayne] Bridge, I have to decide tomorrow. I might have to play both.\" With Ricardo Carvalho, Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko injured, he added that Mikel John Obi\"is a big risk\" and Robben might last \"15, 20 minutes\". Chelsea's chairman, Bruce Buck, has reiterated the club's lavish spending is over. Talking of a plan to be non loss-making, he said: \"A lot will depend on big-money transfers, the less of those we make the easier it will be to meet our plan.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
