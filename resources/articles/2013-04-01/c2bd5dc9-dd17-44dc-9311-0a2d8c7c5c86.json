Worcester have persuaded Ryan, a former Gloucester and Bristol director of rugby, to make the full-time return to the sport that he said he did not want when he took charge of the Scotland forwards in this year's Six Nations. Ryan has had a change of heart and turned down a lucrative column with a newspaper this month. Worcester announced on Tuesday night that Hill had left. The Warriors have failed to mount a challenge for Heineken Cup qualification under him this season, have lost eight of their past nine Premiership matches and their two leading English players, Matt Mullan and Matt Kvesic, are leaving at the end of the season. Hill arrived at Sixways in May 2010 after Worcesterrelegation. He returned them to the Premiership at the first attempt and ensured that last season they retained top-flight status. The same achievement this season has not been enough for Hill to keep his job. The chairman of Worcester's rugby committee, Bill Bolsover, told the club's website: \"Richard was brought into Worcester Warriors to get us promoted back to the Premiership, which he successfully achieved. We then wanted to consolidate our position amongst the elite before breaking out of the bottom four. \"Despite all his hard work, effort, attention to detail and honesty we have not continued the forward momentum. On behalf of everyone at Worcester Warriors I would like to put on record our thanks and appreciation to Richard and we wish him well for the future.\" London Welsh, who will be relegated from the Premiership after one season if the Championship winners meet the entry criteria, will have to make massive cuts next season after losing \u00a34m in the last two years. The Exiles are losing their major backer, Kelvin Bryon, at the end of the season and their parachute payment, which still has to be exactly determined by Premiership Rugby, is expected to be no more than \u00a31m. The cost-cutting measures have already started, with Tony Copsey standing down as chief executive. London Welsh will decide in the coming weeks whether to remain at the Kassam Stadium, where attendances have been the lowest in the Premiership, or return to Old Deer Park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
