He means Saint-Gingolph, on the south bank of Lake Geneva. \u201cWe were five in the boat \u2013 servant, two boatmen, and ourselves. The sail was mismanaged and the boat was filling fast. He can\u2019t swim. I stripped off my coat \u2013 made him strip off his and take hold of an oar, telling him that I thought (being myself an expert swimmer) I could save him, if he would not struggle when I took hold of him \u2013 unless we got smashed against the rocks which were high and sharp, with an awkward surf on them at that minute. We were then about a hundred yards from the shore and the boat in peril. He answered me with the greatest coolness, that \u2018he had no notion of being saved, and that I would have enough to do to save myself, and begged not to trouble me\u2019.\u201d The boat righted. Shelley lived to drown another day, \u201cthe wind having been high enough to tear up some huge trees from the Alps above us\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
