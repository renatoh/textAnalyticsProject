Typical, too, that he did so with a rhetorical flourish that no British trainer (and very few Americans, for that matter) could hope to match. \"We're here in Texas and it's like Texas Hold 'Em [poker],\" Lukas told a lunchtime press conference here in downtown Dallas. \"We're going to go all-in. We're going for the Classic. You don't have much fun at the shallow end of the pool anyhow.\" There was a brief, stunned silence as the local journalists digested the news, then a spontaneous round of applause. Lukas, arguably the most important figure in American racing over the past two decades, had done it again. He had seized the spotlight, and he loved every minute of it. Until Tuesday, it had been generally assumed that Azeri would run as the odds-on favourite in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, the first race on tomorrow's card, which is worth $2m (\u00a31.1m). In the Classic, where the six-year-old mare will face male opponents for only the second time in a long career, she is a 14-1 chance with Coral. The apparent flaw in Lukas's analogy is that a skilful player only bets the entire stack when the odds are in his favour. By contrast, Azeri's connections seem to be passing up a 50-50 chance, or better, in a $2m race for an outside hope of winning a pot twice the size. But Lukas has always played it a different way. He started out as a basketball coach and teacher - his mother had always insisted that he \"should contribute something to society\" - but after a childhood on a farm in Wisconsin, horses were always his first love. He started training thoroughbreds in 1978 after six successful years working with speedball Quarter Horses - the heavily muscled traditional American breed specialising in quarter-mile sprints - and was one of the first trainers to appreciate the possibilities that air travel offered. He won his first Triple Crown race, the Preakness, in 1980, and from that moment on his runners were the ones that everyone feared. Nearly 25 years later Lukas has trained a record 22 winners of Eclipse Awards - basically the Oscars of US racing - and three that took the ultimate accolade as Horse of the Year. In 1992-94 he won six Triple Crown races in a row, and was the first trainer in American history to reach $100m in prize-money. He was the first to reach $200m, too. Lukas's record at the Breeders' Cup is also without parallel. He saddled his first winner at the meeting when Theatrical took the Turf in 1987 and has since sent out 16 more, earning a total of $18.6m. The next trainer in the list, Bill Mott, has less than half that. Lukas will have three runners at this year's Cup, but Azeri is the one the public wants to see. No racemare in American history has won more races - 17, from 23 starts - or prize-money, though much of her success came for Laura de Seroux. The six-year-old has been with Lukas only since the start of this season. Victory for Azeri in the Classic would be another first for Lukas, as no filly or mare has ever won the meeting's richest race. Since the trainer is now 69 years old there may not be many more chances. \"We're trying to do something that's never been done before, and I think that going to the Classic with Azeri adds a little more fuel and pzazz to the whole thing,\" he said, sporting his trademark sunglasses in the gloomy faux-ranch in downtown Dallas that hosted Tuesday's press call. \"There was $2m sitting right there in front of us, but I love the challenge and the competition. Line those bastards up, I love to take them on. The bigger the event, the more I enjoy it.\" Smart, fast-talking and impossibly self-confident, Lukas is not universally admired despite his record of success. \"I think I would describe him as a megalomaniac sociopath,\" one American journalist said this week. \"He has a set of rules that only apply to him.\" No one, though, doubts that an all-in bet from Lukas is one to respect. \"I don't think that there's a more charismatic horse anywhere in the series than Azeri,\" he said. \"And I just love to get in at the deep end.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
