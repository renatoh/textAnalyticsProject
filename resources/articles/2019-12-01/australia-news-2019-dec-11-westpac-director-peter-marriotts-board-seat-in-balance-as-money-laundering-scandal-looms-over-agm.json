Proxy advisers, who give advice to big investors on how to vote at AGMs, are divided on whether Marriott should follow chairman Lindsay Maxsted, chief executive Brian Hartzer and the head of the board risk committee, Ewen Crouch, out the door as part of a clean-out of the highest levels of the bank. The bank is hopeful he will survive but he is likely to earn a significant protest vote after proxy advice firms ISS and CGI Glass called for his removal. Westpac is also likely to earn a vote of 25% or more, or \u201cstrike\u201d against its remuneration report for a second year running, triggering an automatic vote on whether the entire board should be spilled. However, it is extremely unlikely the spill resolution will pass. At what is likely to be a fiery \u2013 and lengthy \u2013 meeting, shareholders are set to grill the board about legal action taken against Westpac by Austrac last month in which the financial intelligence agency accused it of more than 23m breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance laws, including allowing thousands of transactions consistent with child exploitation in the Philippines. Hartzer initially said he would stay to \u201cfix\u201d the bank\u2019s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) problems and deal with the Austrac lawsuit, which is likely to cost the bank more than $1bn to settle. However, he, Maxsted and Crouch announced they would resign after meeting with big investors who demanded their exit. Hartzer departed within a week. Crouch is still a director but his term expires at the end of the AGM and he will not seek re-election. Maxsted has said he will step down by the middle of next year. Finding a replacement for the corporate veteran is regarded by some market observers as the biggest governance challenge facing Westpac, but it will not be dealt with at the AGM. Whoever replaces Maxsted will need to rebuild shattered community and investor trust in the bank at the same time as recruiting new board members who have enough skills and experience to stave off further shareholder action. Marriott, who joined Westpac as a non-executive director in 2013 after a stint as chief financial officer at rival big-four bank ANZ, heads the board\u2019s audit committee and is regarded as a straight shooter, with one market source describing him as a \u201cferal abacus\u201d and another as someone who \u201cactually knows what\u2019s going on\u201d. But with Crouch already committed to leaving, investors lack another plausible target on which to vent their spleen. Three other directors are up for re-election \u2013 Nerida Caesar, Steven Harker and Margaret Seal \u2013 but are set to sail through because they have not been on the board for as long as Marriott. Marriott\u2019s re-election has been endorsed by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which advises funds that control about $2.2tn in savings, and local proxy adviser Ownership Matters, but is opposed by two proxy firms, CGI Glass Lewis and ISS. The position of ISS is important because many of its clients are large US funds that are regarded as likely to follow its advice because they have limited other information about the local market from which they can draw their own conclusions. In a report to clients, CGI Glass Lewis said that because the Austrac lawsuit was filed only recently, shareholders had to decide how to \u201cenforce board accountabilities, without the benefit of allowing [Westpac] more time to consider due process\u201d. \u201cDue to the length of his tenure and his banking background, we also believe normatively that his accountability for these matters should be enforced and that his re-election should not be supported,\u201d the firm said. ISS is also recommending a vote against the remuneration report but the other proxy advisers are believed to be in favour of voting for it. The low threshold of 25% to call a strike means one is likely, but the resulting spill motion appears doomed to fail. Industry sources said that if Maxsted, Hartzer and Crouch had not heeded investor calls to step down, the board would probably have been spilled at the meeting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
