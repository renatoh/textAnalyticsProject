The figures haven't fallen into place,\" the club's vice-president, Adriano Galliani, said. \"Maybe Ronaldinho won't come and a main striker arrives.\" Ronaldinho's brother and agent, Roberto de Assis, has agreed personal terms with Milan but Internazionale and Manchester City are also interested in the Brazilian. Milan are currently fifth in Serie A despite yesterday's Kaka-inspired 5-1 win over Reggina and may miss out on next season's Champions League. Asked if a deal for Ronaldinho might stall because of this, Galliani said: \"Ronaldinho went to Barcelona when they were in the Uefa Cup. It happens to all the great European clubs; I hope it doesn't happen to Milan. Anyway, Ronaldinho is a Barcelona player, not a Milan player.\" Francesco Totti has vowed to \"return stronger than before\" after suffering a cruciate ligament injury in Roma's disappointing 1-1 draw at home to lowly Livorno. The 31-year-old had surgery yesterday and is expected to be out for four months. The news is a bitter blow for second-placed Roma, who are six points behind Internazionale after the leaders beat Torino 1-0 away last night thanks to Julio Cruz's first-half goal and some stubborn defending in the second half. Fourth-placed Fiorentina, who play Rangers in the Uefa Cup semi-final on Thursday, kept up their four-point gap over Milan by beating Palermo at the Artemio Franchi. Marco Donadel scored the only goal of the game and the Viola coach, Cesare Prandelli, said: \"We are doing great things at the moment and we have done since the start of the season.\" Prandelli is hopeful that his Czech international full-back Tomas Ujfalasi, who had to be substituted 30 minutes into the game, will be fit to play Rangers on Thursday. Real Madrid took another big step towards winning their second consecutive La Liga title with a 2-0 win away at Racing Santander yesterday. Ra\u00fal tapped in Robinho's cross early on and Bernd Schuster's side withstood some sustained pressure from Champions League-chasing Racing before Gonzalo Higua\u00edn stroked in a second in injury-time. Real are now 10 points ahead of second-placed Villarreal with five games remaining. Valencia are only two points above the relegation zone after yesterday's 5-1 defeat at Athletic Bilbao."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
