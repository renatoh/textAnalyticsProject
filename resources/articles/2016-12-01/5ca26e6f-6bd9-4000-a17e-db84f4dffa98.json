Wentz is a keen outdoorsman, and recently went hunting with the baseball star Mike Trout in New Jersey. It\u2019s a passion Wentz shares with Eagles guard Allen Barbre, who was delighted with his gift, which bears his jersey number and name. \u201cThis is an awesome gun. I\u2019m excited about it,\u201d Barbre told ESPN. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll shoot it though, it\u2019s pretty nice.\u201d Barbre said he believes the shotgun is a Beretta Silver Pigeon, which retails at around $2,000. That shouldn\u2019t be too much of a stretch for Wentz, whose rookie contract with the Eagles included a $17m signing bonus. Fellow rookie Isaac Seumalo was a bit more bemused by his gift. \u201cI haven\u2019t really held a gun or anything before,\u201d said the guard. \u201cBut I\u2019m more than thankful for it. It looks sweet. Carson said he\u2019d teach me how to use it and all that good stuff.\u201d Wentz has had a promising, if mixed start, to his Eagles career. After throwing five touchdowns and no interceptions in his first three games, he goes into the final weekend of the regular season with as many picks as touchdown passes \u2013 14."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
