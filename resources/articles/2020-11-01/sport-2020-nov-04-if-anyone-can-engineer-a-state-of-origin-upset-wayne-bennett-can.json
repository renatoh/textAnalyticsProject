This time, though, Bennett will not be able to call upon the heroes of series past. He no longer has the likes of Billy Slater, Darren Lockyer, Johnathan Thurston, Cameron Smith, Greg Inglis and Cooper Cronk at his disposal. And he will not have the luxury of, say, luring Alfie Langer back from England to orchestrate a pivotal 2001 game-three triumph \u2013 one of his five series wins from the total seven in charge. But the other interesting thing about that particular series is the fact he blooded 10 debutants and won game one, his first back in the job, after his predecessor lost the previous series. On Wednesday, 19 years later, Bennett will likely field eight debutants at Adelaide Oval, in his first match back in the hot seat, as his depleted Maroons attempt to thwart an assembly of New South Wales stars from steamrolling their way to a third consecutive series win. Indeed, this incarnation of Queensland are the biggest Origin outsiders since the 1990s. As Brad Fittler sows the seeds of a Blues dynasty, injuries, retirements and suspension have devastated their enemies of the state. But that, in and of itself, is not the point. Nor is Bennett\u2019s longevity. The crux is that one of these two factors will be magnified by this year\u2019s condensed Origin format, and whichever it is will either make or break the Maroons. Three games in 15 days suggests a preordained war of attrition, an on-field series of Survivor lost by the squad whose injuries pile up the quickest on the unprecedentedly short turnarounds. Queensland, as has been reported ad nauseam in recent weeks, already find themselves at a distinct disadvantage thanks to the absence of several significant incumbents including Kalyn Ponga, Moses Mbye and Michael Morgan. Their series hinges on young but inexperienced legs. On how, for instance, Queensland\u2019s first rookie centre pairing hold up following Tuesday\u2019s injury scares to Kurt Capewell (groin) and Brenko Lee (calf). Losing either would add further pressure to a backline already shaking on its foundations. Yet even Fittler recognises the potential power of galvanised rookies, having blooded 11 debutants in game one of 2018 \u2013 his first in charge \u2013 that soon became the Blues\u2019 first series win since 2014. \u201cWe had 11 players playing their first game two years ago, so I know exactly what it\u2019s all about,\u201d Fittler said on Tuesday. \u201cThe one thing you know is they have very experienced coaches, so they know how to get a team working together.\u201d Which segues nicely into influencing element No 2. Bennett\u2019s strength lies in his simplicity. The 70-year-old has not endured at the top for three decades on a throne made of pure imperiousness. Demanding \u2013 some say arrogant \u2013 as he is, the \u201cmaster coach\u201d and \u201csuper coach\u201d monikers are more a reflection of his consistency and ability to relate to his players. He does not try to reinvent the wheel \u2013 rugby league is not a complicated game on the field. It is off it where he cultivates the will to win, and an uninterrupted three weeks in camp, without losing his players to their NRL clubs after each game, presents a unique opportunity to write his own narrative. Paul Vautin on Tuesday called Bennett\u2019s imprimatur \u201cguts and intestinal fortitude\u201d. It could, the Queensland great said, help this motley crew engineer the biggest upset since his own 1995 Maroons side pulled off an extraordinary 3-0 win. Whether 2020\u2019s Origin mini-series becomes a regular occurrence in future years is up for discussion and may come down to the all-powerful television ratings. Last week, ARL Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys was leaning towards a shift back to the traditional mid-season slot in 2021. \u201c \u2026 if it\u2019s a runaway success we might look at it again,\u201d V\u2019landys said. \u201cAt this stage it will go back to mid-season.\u201d Even if it does, there is merit to the argument in favour of briefly halting the regular season to cater for a similarly fast-and-furious format, not least because clubs will have all players available every week. Which side of the fence Bennett ultimately sits may depend on what goes down over the next three weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
