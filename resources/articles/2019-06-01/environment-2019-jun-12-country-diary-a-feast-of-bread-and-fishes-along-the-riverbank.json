And the crow\u2019s deft assurance in performing its trick suggested it had done this before. Touching down on the river\u2019s sand and shingle shore, a hunk of bread clamped in its beak, it strode to the water\u2019s edge then dunked the morsel and leaned back to watch. The crow waited until the exact moment when the bread was soaked but not sodden, then plucked it out and swallowed. Some way along the river bank a reed warbler trilled as if applauding, while a bird standing in the water only feet away paid no notice. The crow may have claimed its one bit of bread; this little egret was busy feeding for five. The egret had passed overhead as we made our way upstream and we caught up with it fishing in an old cattle stance, a shallow pool within a wide sweep of the river, a marketplace for shoaling fish. Seeking a closer view, but not wishing to frighten the bird away, we used a dumpy riverbank willow as a blind, approaching on the assumption that if we couldn\u2019t see the egret, then it couldn\u2019t see us. Sure enough, when we crouched down, hands grasping the lichen-encrusted bark, and peered round the trunk, the bird had all its attention fixed on its prey. The egret\u2019s fishing technique was simple, repetitive and effective. It would spring up, rotating in the air and giving a balancing beat of its wings, then plunge its beak under water as it dropped. Two out of every three strikes were rewarded with only a shake of the head, a drip from the bill. But third time lucky, it whipped up a sliver of a fish that would be gulped down alive and wriggling. We saw the egret catch at least a dozen fish before it waded over to the shore, but this was selfless gluttony; the fine plumes trailing down the back of its neck identified it as a breeding bird, with a nest of chicks to satisfy. Not for these egret babies any old scrap of bread, but fresh-caught fish, straight from the parent\u2019s mouth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
