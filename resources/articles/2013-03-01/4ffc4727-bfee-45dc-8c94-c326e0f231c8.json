NOSE JOBS Formula One, vain? Surely not, yet having an aesthetically pleasing appearance is clearly a priority this season after all those cruel snipes at the raised noses of 2012's four-wheeled missiles. To cover up that oh-so horrible stepped nose cone, Formula One's engineers have now come up with something called a \"vanity panel\" to conceal the offending area. This creates a nice smooth look but does little to improve the air flow. Next up, Botox bumpers anyone? 2. DOUBLE DRS RIP DRS alone was not enough for Mercedes or Red Bull last season and they came up with Double DRS. Too clever by far, clearly \u2013 it's been banned for 2013. However, passive drag-reduction systems (they get going once a certain speed is achieved, not by the flick of a switch) are allowed. Plus, it is being limited to designated DRS zones in all sessions, ruling out its use at any point during practice and qualifying. 3. GETTING HEAVIER Pirelli has changed the structure of this season's tyres, making them 2kg heavier. This means each car's minimum weight limit has been increased to 640kg. Which in turn means a slide-rule job is required to get the weight distribution right. The minimum figures are now 292kg:343kg front to rear. With tyre compounds softer, Pirelli reckons they will warm up quicker and improve grip by 3%, allowing drivers to turn into corners a fraction later and so go faster. 4. Q1 CHANGE The HRT team are no more, so qualifying has been tweaked to accommodate fewer cars on the grid. Last season, seven cars were cut to run in Q2; this season six are dispatched in Q1, which means two midfield drivers will go out instead of one. That leaves 16 drivers to jostle for position in Q2, with 10 going through for the 10-minute Q3 harum-scarum. 5. PERRY JUST THE TIPPLE Former MotoGP host Suzi Perry becomes the face of the BBC's Formula One coverage after Jake Humphrey jumped ship to BT Sport \u2013 and she is clearly up for the task of handling the sparky Eddie Jordan. 'I have worked with some tricky characters over the years,' she says. 'I won't name them. But EJ could topple all of them, I think. I have interviewed him a few times over the years. Eddie does what Eddie does and people have said to me how am I going to control Eddie. And I think that's not possible. That's like taking a savage lion and trying to turn it into a pussycat. It's not going to happen. Eddie's going to do what Eddie does.' 2013 calendar 17 Mar Australia Albert Park 24 Mar Malaysia Sepang 14 Apr China Shanghai* 21 Apr Bahrain Sakhir 12 May Spain Circuit de Catalunya* 26 May Monaco Monte Carlo 9 Jun Canada Circuit Gilles Villeneuve* 30 Jun Britain Silverstone* 7 Jul Germany N\u00fcrburgring 28 Jul Hungary Hungaroring 25 Aug Belgium Spa-Francorchamps* 8 Sep Italy Monza* 22 Sep Singapore Marina Bay 6 Oct Korea Yeongam 13 Oct Japan Suzuka* 27 Oct India Buddh* 3 Nov Abu Dhabi Yas Marina 17 Nov United States Austin 24 Nov Brazil Interlagos* *live on BBC1.
