It\u2019s that she is also Aboriginal. Based on her own upbringing in the deserts of Western Australia, the book traces how Williams discovered her love of sport and demonstrates the power of football in providing opportunity and community for one of Australia\u2019s most marginalised groups. \u201cThere are not many children\u2019s books out there that have a young girl achieving her goals,\u201d Williams tells Guardian Australia at Tuesday\u2019s launch of Indigenous Football Week. \u201cI feel like I had a really important and unique story to tell, and the only way it really could be told was through a kids book. It\u2019s exciting to see that there\u2019s a girl out there achieving her dreams and doing what she loves. Your journey is your journey, and your story is your story. It\u2019s important to accept and be proud of where you\u2019ve come from and what you\u2019ve achieved.\u201d It\u2019s perhaps no surprise that this is the book\u2019s central premise given that marginalisation is where Australian football began. Ironically, despite being an introduced game, football was more welcoming to Aboriginal people throughout the 20th century than most other mainstream institutions. As John Moriarty, the first Aboriginal man to represent Australia, said: \u201cBeing Aboriginals, we didn\u2019t have the chance to vote, and we were still second-class citizens in those days. I think the soccer fraternity embraced us, no questions asked.\u201d It was this shared marginalisation that saw football become one of the most diverse and progressive forces in the country; one that understood the contributions Aboriginal people can make both to sport and society. This week, then, it is worth asking where Aboriginal women fit into this wider story. \u201cThe [female] players from back then paved the way,\u201d Williams says. \u201cThey were still paying their own way to go on trips and wearing men\u2019s strips. But the fact that they could do that then has really encouraged a lot of Indigenous people that it can be done. It would be lovely to see their stories being out there and highlighted more.\u201d As Aboriginal men like Moriarty, Gordon Briscoe and Charlie Perkins have become household names, Aboriginal women have remained doubly-marginalised; their football legacies affected not just by their race but also by their gender. Names like Karen Menzies, the first Aboriginal woman to represent the Matildas, alongside those of Bridgette Starr, Leonie Young (n\u00e9e Yow Yeh), Felicity Huntington and Belinda Dawney are hardly known despite these women playing just as important a role in football\u2019s history as their male counterparts. \u201cWhen it comes to Indigenous Football Week, bringing out all the Indigenous people that played or represented their state or country [matters],\u201d Williams says. \u201cThere\u2019s always a bit of extra sacrifice there, whether that be through family, hardship, or financial \u2013 there\u2019s always something there. Getting that recognition first is really important.\u201d Ros Moriarty, the managing director of the John Moriarty Football Foundation, which runs coaching and training programs in remote Indigenous communities, recognises that more needs to be done for Indigenous women and girls in football. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that the same focus is on bringing girls through,\u201d she says. \u201cInterestingly, if you look at the Matildas, they have a more recent track record of bringing Indigenous players through. The W-League also has more representatives than the A-League. So big focus needs to be on women because we\u2019re seeing those results with probably not that much development in the recent past.\u201d Williams, along with Matildas teammates Kyah and Gema Simon, are the most visible examples of what Aboriginal women can offer football, and what football can offer them. Their steps are being followed by the likes of Western Sydney Wanderers goalkeeper Jada Whyman and Sydney FC winger Shadeene Evans, herself a product of the John Moriarty Football Foundation. This is why stories like Williams\u2019 are so significant: they add long-neglected voices to a national conversation about who does and doesn\u2019t belong, not just in sport but in Australia more widely. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of uneducated people,\u201d Williams says. \u201cNobody really knows the stories of what Indigenous people go through. A lot of people are actually curious about what life in the desert is like so I think it\u2019s just understanding that and understanding culture on both sides. \u201cMy parents have a multicultural background as well \u2013 my dad\u2019s Aboriginal and my mum\u2019s American \u2013 so they\u2019ve experienced a lot of racism [due to] their marriage. What they taught me growing up is love and acceptance, and no matter what I\u2019ve gone through, that\u2019s how I\u2019ve seen everything.\u201d Moriarty agrees: \u201cPositive media and stories around the grassroots aspect of football and the power it gives families and communities to impact different outcomes for their kids [are important]. If we want to leverage the value that is within both Indigenous and women\u2019s football, we\u2019d love to see more media coverage to look at the innovation that\u2019s happening \u2013 and tell more stories.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
