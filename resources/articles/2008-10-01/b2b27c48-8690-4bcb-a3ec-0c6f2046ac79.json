Led by the singer Tatou, and driven on by the rousing, rhythmic banjo and guitar work of an instrumentalist known simply as Blu, this is a good-time acoustic band who set out to celebrate the rousing history of their home city, Marseilles. They sing in the ancient local language of Occitan, as well as in French and English, and their easy-going material echoes anything from country and folk styles through to music hall, jug-band music and the blues. This time round there's extra instrumentation, with a dash of accordion and brass, plus some flamenco. But it's the stomping sing-alongs such as Ma Rue N'Est Pas Longue and Labour Song that make Moussu T so distinctive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
