Nowadays both the British and Hastings have lost some significance, and the new champion has several chances in a year's reign to confirm his status. There still remains extra pressure on a grandmaster elevated above his colleagues, so Stuart Conquest's first prize with 7/9 last week at the Capo d'Orso Open in Sardinia is a significant achievement. The British champion was the only UK representative in the 178-player field, but he went through unbeaten, finished half a point clear of a posse of ex-Soviets, and rode his luck in the final round when Sweden's Tiger Hillarp Persson could have made more of a sacrificial attack. Conquest's other key game was his early-round win given below against the Swiss No2. It began quietly with White's careful 6 d3 and 8 a3 version of the 3 Bb5 Ruy Lopez. Black gained central space, though his h7-h6 later weakened g6. Matters went seriously wrong with 19...dxe4 (Nc6) and 20...Qc6 (Nxe4) which opened up the a2-g8 diagonal for White's Lopez bishop and gave his knights access to the king side. The concluding tactics starting 25 Ne6! were brief and brutal. 28 Bxh6! envisaged gxh6 29 Qxh6 Ne8 30 Rd4 with a Rh4 mating attack, while Black resigned in view of 29...Nc4 30 Bxg7 Nh7 31 Qh6 Qe6 32 Bd4 Nf6 33 Bxc4 bxc4 34 Ne4! when the defences collapse.
