Save the World is full of cute flourishes: glockenspiel solos cropping up in the middle of grinding dancefloor monsters, a surfeit of handclaps and cowbells, the very existence of the lute-driven techno madrigal The Lonesome King and the Balearic dream of Please Sunrise. Save the World does not quite reach the heights Mayer and Superpitcher regularly scale individually, but there are enough twists and turns to keep evil at bay for now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
