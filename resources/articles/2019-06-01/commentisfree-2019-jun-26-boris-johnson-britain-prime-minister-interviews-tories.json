How much of Britain will he drag down too?", "bodyText": "No one expected the final stage of the Conservative party leadership contest to be a staid and dignified affair. The Tories are now more spectacle than party, more farcical roadshow than government. But barely a week in, and it feels like events are escalating at the pace of a crammed last episode of a poorly crafted drama \u2013 the writers just want to wrap it up because they have already been told there will be no second series. Boris Johnson\u2019s much anticipated interviews over the past 24 hours have been a series of how-did-we-end-up-here moments. In an interview on LBC yesterday, he petulantly refused to answer questions about an allegedly recent photo of him and his partner looking cosy after the domestic incident reported last week. \u201cWhy should I!\u201d he sulked. The rest of the time he descended into word salads and often just sounds, a harrumphing cornered animal. In another even more alarming interview, we saw Johnson talk about his supposed model bus crafting hobby in slow motion, his eyes glazing over. It wasn\u2019t that it had the air of something made up that was worrying, it was that he seemed to be drifting away as he was fabulating. Like a chirpy robot running out of batteries and slowing down to a drawl, Johnson\u2019s whole demeanour during the campaign so far is that of someone who has burned himself out just before destiny called. He\u2019s tired and irritated and can\u2019t keep up. His shtick, the bumbling posh boy swashbuckling act, is getting so old even he is bored of it, especially when it doesn\u2019t quite cut it when scrutiny is at full-on potential prime minister levels. For as long as I can remember, Johnson supporters have been telling me that it\u2019s all a clever act, that the man is an intellectual who disarms his critics in order to stealthily outwit them. Not many are saying that any more. He\u2019s not even as good as Donald Trump; his bag of base-galvanising tricks is much sparser. Business leaders (remember when they were the Tories\u2019 mates?) are now using code red language. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said \u201cthe idea that Boris Johnson will become our prime minister fills me \u2013 and many other business people \u2013 with horror\u201d. Johnson is now nobody without the Brexit ultras of the Conservative party membership. And he knows they will see him through, so why expend any more effort than is needed? \u201cWhy should I!\u201d should be his campaign slogan. This all leaves Jeremy Hunt shadow-boxing an opponent who cannot be bothered and whose temperament is so frayed he now cannot handle basic debate. And so Hunt, looking a bit lost, too scared to alienate Brexiters but also needing something to actually campaign against, gestures weakly at Johnson\u2019s evasiveness in a general \u201cthis is just not on\u201d fashion, while posting random pictures of himself on the trail eating pizza and hashtagging his every move #hastobehunt. Inspiring stuff. The Johnson campaign is now officially in so much trouble that it has hired Six Sigma saviours Iain Duncan Smith and Mark Fullbrook, the man behind Zac Goldsmith\u2019s dirty yet still unsuccessful campaign against Sadiq Khan. The phrase you will hear more than any over the next few weeks is \u201ca week is a long time in politics\u201d as analysts hedge, still convinced that Johnson might curveball himself somehow. It\u2019s not going to happen, despite the wheels coming off the dubious bus. Johnson and his Brexit base are playing out the endgame of the Conservative party, so long in the making. The prophecy will be fulfilled and Johnson will become prime minister. But the day he steps into No 10, when it is no longer up to the Conservative party membership, when the level of scrutiny he faces is infinitely greater than a Nick Ferrari interview on LBC, Johnson and the Tories will fall off the edge. The question then will be how much of the country will they take with them. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
