Just before Londoners last elected a mayor in May 2012 the main candidates signed up to a pledge for tackling homelessness which included bringing rough sleeping to an end. A Mr Johnson, a Mr Livingstone and a Mr Paddick all reached for their pens. How could they have done otherwise? But as the next election approaches is anyone surprised that rough sleeping in the capital has not gone away? The other week I went out on the streets of Westminster with staff from the remarkable Dr Hickey Surgery, based in the Cardinal Hume Centre in Arneway Street off Horseferry Road. It provides NHS primary healthcare of a special and specialised kind for people of no fixed address in the area. That mission means, almost by definition, that such people may not know of the surgery or its service. So part of that service involves seeking those people out. On a damp, drizzly evening, we walked for miles, from Victoria Street to Smith Square to Pimlico to Chelsea Bridge Road, visiting known people in known doorways and spotting newcomers camped in covered corners of some of the richest streets on Earth. Three men and a woman sat at the back of a theatre, one with a guitar in a case. They were Britons, chatty and cheerful. Under a bridge, two Polish men talked in torrents, one of them much given to kissing the hands of the women in our group. The pair are friends, I was told. One usually sleeps elsewhere, but was paying a visit. In the fine forecourt of a plush shop we met Romanians, new on the block it seemed. A common language, Spanish, was identified. Yes, we were doctors. No, we weren\u2019t police. A leaflet with a map was handed out, giving directions and times: a free service, no strings attached, please drop by. Elsewhere, more English speakers, each alone, some of them familiar, others not, each with their portable bedding and small possessions. In one dark spot by rushing traffic where several improvised sleeping spaces were set out there was a miniature drinks station: milk, teabags, mugs. Dr Paul O\u2019Reilly, one of the Hickey surgery\u2019s two GPs - the other is its founder, Dr Mary Hickey herself - and a regular on these excursions escaped into his work from being \u201can unhappy student of theology.\u201d He had earlier recalled some of the changes that have occurred in the neighbourhood and among the local clientele and since the practice opened in 1987: the waning of bedsit land; the loss of hostels; the advent of crack cocaine (\u201cthe whole homeless population completely changed simply as a result of the availability of a particular drug.\u201d); the influxes of newcomers from different parts of the UK and beyond. \u201cYou get cycles of new sets of homeless people,\u201d Dr O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cThe Irish, the Somalis, the Poles, the Ethiopians, the Romanians and Bulgarians and the Eritreans. You see very distinct waves. We\u2019re now back to the Irish and also the Scottish.\u201d The surgery enjoys some modest overseas renown: a Latvian patient once revealed that its work was known about back home. Its cosmopolitan character befits its origins in an international city. Newcastle-born Dr Hickey, a nun, had returned from doing healthcare work in Zambia when she\u2019d detected a new outlet for her energies. \u201cShe hung out a shingle, begged an office and got going.\u201d The motivation of the surgery is easily summarised: to provide general practice to the homeless population that is as good as everybody else expects. What it delivers can\u2019t be described so neatly and tidily. \u201cHomeless people on the whole are sicker than most people,\u201d Dr O\u2019Reilly explains. \u201cTheir medical needs are quite often what cause them to be homeless, cause them to remain homeless and to get worse while they are homeless. Yet they also have less access to medical services. That\u2019s why they are forever ending up in A&amp;E departments, which aren\u2019t equipped to meet their needs.\u201d Before we set out in the dark the surgery\u2019s patient participation group had met, kindly allowing me to sit in. A trio of articulate and clearly able individuals spoke of how the surgery\u2019s tailored type of care had helped them through some of their darkest times. One said it had pretty much saved his life after he had lost his way and dropped out of society. \u201cIt gave me a direction no-one else has.\u201d There is a focus on substance and alcohol misuse (with a dedicated worker) and on \u201cchronic severe mental illness,\u201d as would be expected given the problems of clientele of leading London homelessness charities, such as St Mungo\u2019s Broadway. The surgery\u2019s nurse described her work as far more than simply medical: she listens, she advises, she puts people in contact with others who can help them with their problems better than she can. People are welcome to just drop in for cups of tea. There is a lot of listening, an aspect of patient care that many fear is disappearing from the GP mainstream with major ill-effects. The Care Quality Commission recently rated the Hickey surgery\u2019s work as outstanding. This beacon of humanity in SW1 shines the more brightly due to the deepening darkness of the world in which it works. Mayor Johnson\u2019s rapid response No Second Night Out initiative, launched in conjunction with homelessness charities and the boroughs in 2011, has claimed some successes with helping newcomers to the streets, but figures released earlier this year suggested that rough sleeping across London as a whole had risen by 79% since 2012. The Combined Homelessness and Information Network reported in June that 7,581 people slept rough during 2014/15, a rise of 16% on the previous year. In Westminster, one homelessness shelter has just been awarded some extra funds, but the view from the ground is that the supply of vital forms of homelessness provision - hostel places, secure, low-cost housing, the sorts of support that really works for human beings caught up in mazes of complex needs - are failing to match demand. Conservative mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith has suggested an idea for an early intervention programme to prevent vulnerable people from ending up sleeping rough. Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan has expressed his shock at the news that the shortage of emergency beds has led to young homeless people in central London being given tickets to enable them to sleep on night buses. There will be more on this issue from both men and from their fellow contestants for City Hall. They must strive to be honest about what they and those they work with can achieve. London\u2019s sheer size and drawing power may mean that rough sleeping will always be a part of it. But a city that so often proclaims its greatness can surely do better for all its homeless than it is now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
