The backlog has been described as \u201ca national disgrace\u201d and a form of institutional racism. According to research seen by Guardian Australia, the backlog has built over decades. In 2011 only 3,685 of the more than 29,587 outstanding claims had been determined, leaving 25,912 awaiting assessment. By 2016 there were 29,289 outstanding land claims, of which 197 were more than 16 years old, 520 were more than 11 years old and about 15,000 were more than six years old. The chief executive of the NSW Aboriginal Land Council, James Christian, said at the current rate of processing it would take the NSW government 100 years to resolve the 37,000 claims still outstanding. Christian said at the bureaucratic level \u201cthere\u2019s been institutional racism, deliberate obstacles\u201d. \u201cThe most disappointing thing is that successive governments in New South Wales have failed to deliver on the beneficial nature of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which was designed to provide some compensation and remedy for ongoing effects of Aboriginal dispossession,\u201d Christian said. \u201cIt was intended that the process would be simple, quick and inexpensive and it would deliver vast tracts of crown land. We barely have the scraps, really, in terms of what we have been able to reacquire. \u201cThere\u2019s huge opportunity for our people that hasn\u2019t been delivered on and there\u2019s a relevant legal maxim, which is: justice delayed is justice denied.\u201d Land that could be used for cultural, social and economic benefit \u2013 like community housing \u2013 is effectively \u201cfrozen in time\u201d by claim delays. \u201cBy the time they\u2019ve been processed, local governments have planned all their roads and infrastructure around those blocks of land. Investors don\u2019t stick around, they move on. \u201cThe land rights act really should be delivering us financial independence and economic prosperity and it\u2019s failing to do that because of the continued bureaucratic obstruction.\u201d The NSW Aboriginal Land Rights Act was passed in 1983. Under the act, each claim goes to the minister for final approval. Land councils may appeal a ministerial decision \u2013 once the minister has signed off. In 2018, while hearing one of those appeals, NSW Land and environment court justice Nicola Pain was highly critical of the long delays. The act did not give the minister a time frame in which to finalise claims, she said, \u201cbut on any measure the delays in finalisation of some land claims are excessive\u201d. \u201cThe NSW Parliament has chosen to create through the act a scheme for the making of land claims over specified crown land by land councils in specified circumstances in recognition of the dispossession of Aboriginal people. \u201cA practical and responsible consequence of meeting legislative obligations is that departmental resources are dedicated to achieving them.\u201d Some claims of more than six years old, she said \u201cwere already suffering from the danger of evidence degrading\u201d. A University of Wollongong researcher, John Corkill, has collected data on unprocessed land claims dating back to the act\u2019s beginnings in 1983. He was \u201chorrified\u201d to discover successive NSW governments have made \u201cserious errors\u201d in administering the act. \u201cThe administration of the land rights act is not fit for purpose,\u201d Corkill said. \u201cIt\u2019s broken. And it\u2019s broken because the government set out to break it. \u201cI\u2019m very unhappy to discover how badly betrayed not just Aboriginal people are. But non-Indigenous people who thought that this was being made right, we\u2019ve been double-crossed too.\u201d \u201cOn any analysis, this is deeply serious and the betrayal and the injustice is multi-layered, it\u2019s fundamental and has been going on for years. \u201cI think it is institutionalised racism and I think it\u2019s been the old lands department, a pillar of the white dispossession of Aboriginal people, that\u2019s been the problem.\u201d The leading native title and land claims barrister Tony McAvoy SC said the 37,000 unresolved claims were a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d. \u201cWhen it was passed in 1983, the preamble to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act acknowledged that land is of spiritual, social, cultural and economic importance to Aboriginal people and that the land in NSW has been taken without compensation,\u201d McAvoy said. He said the mechanism to provide compensation \u201chas been ignored\u201d. \u201cAt the moment in NSW, we have a situation where there has been a massive amount of support for the Black Lives Matter campaign and the stop Aboriginal deaths in custody campaign. \u201cPart of that whole campaign is the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in prisons and in juvenile detention centres, and in response to that, we heard one of the members of the LNP government in the Legislative Council in mid-June talk about how the over-incarceration rate was simply a product of poverty on the part of Aboriginal people. \u201cIt seems to me that the government is trying to absolve itself from responsibility by saying it\u2019s just a product of poverty when they are in large part the authors of that poverty,\u201d McAvoy said. \u201cHere you see they\u2019ve set up a system to relieve economic inequities but failed to implement it.\u201d In the current government, responsibility for crown lands is shared between the minister for water, property and housing, Melinda Pavey, and the minister for planning, Rob Stokes, but claims are managed through the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE). A DPIE spokesperson said that in the last year (2019-20) more than 1,500 claims were determined, with 280 land grants approved. \u201cThis represents the highest number of claims ever processed and grants ever made since the commencement of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in 1983,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe Department is committed to processing claims as quickly as possible and has been working with the NSW Aboriginal Land Council and individual Local Aboriginal Land Councils to accelerate the determination of land claims.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
