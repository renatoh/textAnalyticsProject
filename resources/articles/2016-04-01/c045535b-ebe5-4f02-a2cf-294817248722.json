On Monday night Labor pulled ahead of the Coalition in Newspoll for the first time since Malcolm Turnbull wrested the leadership from Tony Abbott last year, with a two-party preferred lead of 51% to 49%. Landry, whose seat of Capricornia is the second most marginal Coalition seat in the country, responded to the poor poll by telling the ABC the government needs to do a better job of selling its policies. \u201cIt\u2019s been portrayed in the media that we are not focused. It\u2019s coming across that we are wishy-washy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have had a great lot of successes and there\u2019s some fabulous things the government wants to do. I think we have to really focus on getting the economy on track.\u201d Conservative MP Kevin Andrews said \u201cpolls go up and down, when any new leader comes in there\u2019s a honeymoon period\u201d. \u201cObviously Turnbull has had a honeymoon period but now as we get closer to an election Australians want to concentrate on the choice between Turnbull and Shorten,\u201d he said. Andrews was dumped from the frontbench after Turnbull took the leadership in September. This week Andrews announced he was prepared to challenge Malcolm Turnbull for the prime ministership \u201cif circumstances arose\u201d. According to the Newspoll, Turnbull\u2019s preferred prime minister rating (48%) has dropped 16 points since the peak reached in November. Shorten was rated better prime minister by 27% in the survey, up six points in the fortnight. The poll suggests the Coalition\u2019s primary vote has dropped five points since the beginning of 2016, and Turnbull\u2019s satisfaction rating has tumbled by 15 points over the course of this year. Turnbull refused to comment on the poll. Appearing on Q&amp;A, cabinet minister Christopher Pyne blamed Labor\u2019s resurgent polling on a \u201cmessy week\u201d in which far-reaching tax reform was proposed then pulled within two days. But he said \u201cby the time of election the choice will be very clear\u201d. Labor senator Sam Dastyari told ABC \u201cthe honeymoon that Malcolm Turnbull first enjoyed when he became leader was never going to last\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
