The 35-year-old Calzaghe, undefeated in 43 contests, has held the WBO version of the title since 1997 when he defeated Chris Eubank. Kessler, who has won all his 39 professional fights, will be defending his WBA and WBC belts. \"This is probably the biggest fight that can be made in the world,\" said Warren. \"Both are undefeated and at the top of their game. I really can't wait. This is extra, extra special.\" The stadium, which housed 35,000 for Calzaghe's last contest against the American Peter Manfredo, will be set up to accommodate 60,000 spectators. The contest will be televised by Setanta as part of a multi-fight deal Warren has concluded with the subscription network for the next 12 months, ending his exclusive agreement with ITV. The promoter said: \"This is the most expensive fight I have ever put on outside the heavyweights in terms of purses and everybody who watches boxing in Britain should take their hats off to Setanta, because without them this fight would not be happening.\" Setanta signalled its intent when the company outbid Sky to televise Ricky Hatton's world title contest against Jos\u00e9 Luis Castillo. Its director of sport, Trevor East, said: \"We feel privileged to have Joe Calzaghe sitting alongside our Premiership football and US PGA golf coverage.\" Matt Skelton, the Commonwealth heavyweight champion, and Michael Sprott, who will challenge for the title at the O2 Arena in London on Saturday, have described the fight as the most important of their careers, with the promoter, Warren, saying the winner is likely to go on to vie for a world title. The 40-year-old Skelton has not fought for more than a year since winning the Commonwealth title when he outpointed his British rival Danny Williams - he has been hampered by a training injury, a fractured bone in his hand. Sprott, 32, will be having his first fight since his third-round knockout of Audley Harrison in February, a result which wrecked plans for a Skelton-Harrison showdown. Skelton beat Sprott three years ago but admitted he would prefer not to be facing him again. \"I've fought all the British and Commonwealth fighters and the British scene is a bit of a round-robin,\" he said. \"Now I want to move on. I'd like to fight on the world stage.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
