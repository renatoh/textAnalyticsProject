That's what they all say", "bodyText": "Liverpool have long been considered gatecrashers at this evening's Champions League final having squeezed out more fancied opponents en route to Turkey but their progress to the Ataturk Stadium was finally blocked yesterday, albeit only by an over-zealous steward. Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Xabi Alonso and Sami Hyypia arrived for the pre-match media conference only to be dropped off at the wrong gate and turned away because they did not have the correct accreditation. The tracksuited trio, accompanied by the club's press officer and the club secretary Bryce Morrison, were forced to wait in the pouring rain outside the ground for a quarter of an hour with the local steward, unaware of whom he was dealing with, barring their entry. By the time red-faced Uefa officials were made aware of the impasse, the players, manager and officials were drenched, with their mood having only marginally improved by the time they began the press conference. \"They tried to chase us away on the gate, but we are here now,\" said Hyypia. \"Nobody has been able to keep us away. They tried on the gate, but we got in.\" Uefa officials were hugely apologetic for the misunderstanding. \"I knew they were a few minutes late but I didn't know why,\" said the Uefa delegate Timo Walden. \"I was waiting for them downstairs and got a text message from their press officer asking where was the correct gate. I didn't know they had been refused entry, though - that was obviously why they were a little late.\" Meanwhile, Diego Maradona last night warned Milan that they would have to be equally vigilant if they were to keep Liverpool out. The Argentinian World Cup winner believes the Merseysiders may be \"hungrier\" than Milan and could upset the form book. \"You have got to say that Milan are the favourites but you cannot discount Liverpool because they have a hungry look about them,\" said Maradona. \"Milan have the edge in terms of personnel, but don't write off Liverpool. They will be up for this match.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
