In training last week, the Arsenal manager let loose the fiercely committed Tony Adams and Patrick Vieira - a pair to whom the club's pride matters intensely - on to Sylvain Wiltord and Robert Pires, both under-achievers of late, in a two-v-two confrontation. It can only have sharpened them up and the result was apparent in Arsenal's embarrassingly easy win yesterday. Wiltord scored twice while Pires made two and scored one himself in what was ultimately a one-sided contest in which a sadly outclassed Rangers contributed to their own downfall with two own goals. All this with Thierry Henry, Arsenal's leading goalscorer, left on the bench. It may only have been against a side bottom but one in the First Division, but after four Premiership matches without a victory any win was welcome. 'We felt the team was upcoming at Leicester last week and we had confirmation today,' said Wenger. 'It should help our confidence for the match against Bradford on Tuesday.' Poor Rangers. They had chances early on but you sensed when they failed to take them that they would be made to pay. 'It was harsh on us in the first half but they murdered us in the second,' admitted the Rangers manager Gerry Francis. 'If you can't learn from their passing and movement then you can't learn from anything. It was exquisite.' With the energy and optimism of underdogs, Rangers went for Arsenal early on and the 6ft 6in striker Peter Crouch should have given them a lead when Ian Baraclough's cross led to confusion in the visitors' defence, only for him to sidefoot the chance into the side netting from close range. Next, Baraclough's left foot swung in a corner which Crouch headed goalwards. Seaman saved but spilled the ball, Vieira kicking it away as the home side and their support insisted - wrongly, TV replays proved - that the ball had crossed the line. In that moment, the game turned. Arsenal broke out, Rangers still feeling aggrieved, and when Lee Dixon sent in a low cross, Chris Plummer stretched out a leg and turned the ball past the wrong-footed Ludek Miklosko. Now stunned, Rangers conceded again within a minute, Bergkamp cutting the ball back for Wiltord to shoot home via Baraclough's ankles. Now Arsenal have, uncharacteristically, been known to let two-goal leads slip this season but this time there was no chance. Arsenal simply invited Rangers on to them, then carved them open on the break with incisive alacrity, Vieira at the hub of all their work, Bergkamp a willing creative ally as he revelled in the space. Home hopes of a revival were blown away in a three-goal, nine-minute salvo. First Ashley Cole sent in a low cross which the former Arsenal defender Matthew Rose could only turn into his own net under pressure from Wiltord. Next, Pires swung in a corner from the right, Rangers' now hesitant defence allowing the ball to reach Wiltord some 15 yards out for a volley which passed through a crowded goalmouth and entered the net via a post. Then Parlour sent Pires clear to tuck the ball past the exposed Miklosko. After that, Arsenal went easy on the hapless Hoops and Bergkamp's goal, clipped over Miklosko after Vieira had sent him clear, was scant reflection of their dominance. They have lacked ruthlessness so far this season; if some of the attitude of Adams and Vieira really has rubbed off on such as Wiltord and Pires - both of whom Wenger fined for late-night activities which made him question their attitude - then Arsenal might yet salvage some silverware this season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
