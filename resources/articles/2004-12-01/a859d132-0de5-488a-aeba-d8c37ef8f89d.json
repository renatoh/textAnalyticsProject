Sir Brian Mawhinney, the former Conservative cabinet minister, and The Guardian have endured a bruising relationship over the years. On a Tuesday morning in Zurich, however, past battles matter little as we swap notes before our respective meetings with Sepp Blatter. Mawhinney, who in his current position as chief executive of the Football League turns out to be both affable and conspiratorial, lays out his agenda. With many of his clubs on the brink of bankruptcy, he has come to argue his case against the disastrous financial impact of Fifa's transfer window. Rolling up his metaphorical sleeves, Mawhinney is ready to proceed down \"the legal route\" in an attritional attempt to secure the survival of 72 English football clubs. \"How long have you got with Blatter?\" I ask. \"Ten minutes,\" Mawhinney snorts, reminding me he is more used to the interminable meetings surrounding \"small matters like the Northern Ireland peace process\". He smiles when hearing of my hour-long audience with Blatter - the man who runs world football and a politician renowned for his ability to sidestep questions at the heart of the game. Blatter soon greets me effusively. Promising not to delay our appointment for long, he turns to the man fighting for the Football League. I give Mawhinney an encouraging wink. Eleven minutes later, in his vast office, Blatter nods gravely when I mention the intricacies of Mawhinney's case as an example of his responsibilities at Fifa. \"Details, details,\" Blatter says, \"always details. I like Sir Brian very much, but it is better he meets my committee-men.\" Blatter agrees to spend the first chunk of our time together discussing a much more personal set of details. While I've not travelled to Zurich in sole pursuit of his mysterious inner-life, I am strangely intrigued by the hidden story of the 64-year-old man wrapped inside his often oily presidential persona. I've jotted down some childishly simple questions like, \"Sepp Blatter - who the hell are you? How's your love-life? How did a once-obscure Swiss public-relations man end up controlling the world's most cherished and richest sport?\" Blatter answers these Smash Hits-style queries enthusiastically. \"I always wear blue,\" he reveals as he caresses the crisp lapel of his expensive blue suit, \"because my father was a worker in a chemical factory for 40 years. He always dressed in a blue uniform. We were not poor but life could be difficult.\" Born in Visp, close to the imposing Matterhorn mountain in the Swiss Alps, Blatter remembers that, \"I became involved with football at the age of four. My parents were unhappy when they saw how my shoes had been affected by kicking the ball. So my first memory of football is of being reprimanded. When I went to university I was offered a contract with Lausanne Sport. But I was only 18 and needed my father's signature. He said, 'No - you will never earn your living in football'.\" Blatter, who has enjoyed a lucrative career since joining Fifa in 1975, pauses dramatically. \"He was a little wrong about that . . .\" Despite the myriad criticisms of Blatter as the world's most powerful sporting administrator, he oozes confidence. When asked to describe himself as a centre-forward, he swaggers with delight. \"I was very fast and determined. I hit more than 20 goals a season many times.\" The tubby predator says he might have made it as a top footballer had his father not insisted on him taking an economics degree instead. \"Yes,\" Blatter stresses, \"according to the coaches who saw me play. They said, 'You have the talent . . .'\" He is just as bullish about his past work in tourism, PR and as a sports journalist. \"Were you a good writer?\" I ask after he proudly produces his press card. \"It was said, yes. I was best in features.\" In tandem with his scoring prowess as a striker, it emerges that Blatter might also be something of a jungle cat between the sheets. He laughs uproariously when I ask him how many times he has been married. \"Three times. First with the mother of my daughter. A second marriage ended in another divorce.\" He leans forward and, eyes twinkling, discloses that, \"I had a wonderful encounter at the end of 2002 - but it lasted exactly five months. That divorce has just been made official.\" Blatter looks as if he's enjoying himself enough to crack open a bottle of schnapps and slap on a Barry White record. But he shifts uncomfortably in his chair when, changing the cosy mood, I ask why it has taking Fifa so long to discipline Spain after the racist chanting during last month's friendly against England. \"You have to give Spain the possibility to make a dossier. I would first like to see this file and not speculate . . .\" Blatter hesitates when pressed on the most appropriate punishment for that indefensible night. \"If you take Fifa's disciplinary code,\" he mutters, reaching for a booklet, \"we can see many possibilities . . .\" Stressing that I'd prefer not to hear him reading from a pamphlet, I ask him what he personally thinks Fifa should do to punish racism. \"You can go from a yellow card to a suspension,\" he says vaguely, while promising the findings of Fifa's disciplinary committee will be made public this week. Yet a month has already slipped by since the Madrid crowd tried to racially humiliate players like Shaun Wright-Phillips and Ashley Cole. Now firmly astride my holier-than-thou horse, I talk about living in South Africa for the first 20-odd years of my life. That night at the Bernab\u00e9u carried a Spanish echo of apartheid - surely Fifa are morally obligated to make an example of Spain? \"Yes,\" Blatter finally says, after a long silence. \"This judgment should set an example. I have my own idea how I would handle it - by going to the executive committee, which has the power in a difficult or important case to make a judgment. I will propose they make a very strong declaration against racism.\" In endorsing the belief that some kind of definitive \"shock\" needs to be administered, Blatter argues that intervention by match-day officials would be more productive than forcing Spain to play their next game behind closed doors. \"I think that's the worst thing to do, because if you take people out of the stadium you cannot educate them. If the referee or the match-commissioner had the courage in Madrid, they could have taken a microphone and said, 'If there is one more outbreak of racism then I will stop the match.' I would support that action.\" Blatter also insists he will give England unqualified backing should they walk off the pitch in protest at any future racist barracking. But, while sounding suitably presidential in such instances, he is notably light on the precise long-term measures Fifa might adopt to combat a scourge of the European game. Racism is only one of many crises currently facing football. Blatter nods vigorously when I repeat the Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein's recent comment that the game has reached \"saturation point\" and is in \"intensive care\". \"I agree. There is no doubt football is over-exposed - especially on TV but also for the spectators. You cannot have caviar five days a week without indigestion. I've just read a report on how the game is struggling in Italy, for example. There are less and less people in the stadium and the TV ratings are not so good. \"So I'm very concerned about the state of football. My deepest concern is that, if you have no controlling mechanism, at the end you will only have a very few clubs at the top. The rich will become richer and take control of the best players. It is already there now.\" In the midst of revealing how Fifa might better regulate football - by reducing the fixture list in all national leagues and increasing the number of domestic players in each team - Blatter underlines the inflexibility of the English game. He claims this intransigence is even undermining Fifa's attempt to ease player-fatigue before the 2006 World Cup. \"We have said that all leagues have to adapt their calendar for 2005-6 so they play their last match on May 14. Only one national association says this is not possible - England, of course. Even while we're in the process of trying to find a solution, they just say it's impossible. With such an attitude you can never help the state of football. But I am still confident I will win this battle.\" Blatter shrugs aside my own certainty that he will be unable to convince the Premiership that eventually they must cut two teams from their league. Instead he homes in on Arsenal as an example of a Premiership team who rarely feature more than two Englishmen. \"We must try and have five domestic players in a team. This will give the clubs a chance to educate local players.\" Questioned on how he might make such a policy stick in a modern European community, he concedes: \"It is complicated. We have to have the blessing of the European Union because it will affect the free circulation of people. But in the new European constitution the specificity of sport is recognised. This issue is specific to football.\" Fifa will at least have the backing of its old rival Uefa as it seeks to make this a core proposal in Blatter's future strategy. Yet for all the grand pronouncements which Blatter is so adept at making, he says little which is particularly incisive or practical. He suggests instead that his presidency is \"like being a missionary in the Sahara - you preach and preach and no one is listening.\" The real problem for Blatter, of course, is the exact opposite. Every hazy idea or platitude is shredded by the international media - with the most searing criticism of his bloated organisation stemming from this country. \"Sometimes the papers in Germany and Italy kick against me,\" he sighs gloomily, \"but nothing like the English tabloids. Every morning at home, before I come to work, I use my lap-top to see what they say. I understand when they say I have foolish ideas - that is legitimate criticism. But it hurts when people spend months and months and go to court to try and spoil my name. They always fail.\" In highlighting his \"proudest achievement\" - the fact that many of the newest members of the 205 international associations attached to Fifa are rising fast up the world rankings - Blatter is already angling for re-election in the summer of 2007. The dearth of alternative candidates could yet secure him a third term. But he is far more engaging when talking about his old village team. Blatter still yells for them from the touchline some freezing Saturday afternoons in Visp. \"That's when I feel most at home in football ...\" He might not be the man to save the game from its worst excesses, but I end up liking the old devil. It is not a view shared by the Football League's chief executive. In the airport restaurant a couple of hours later, Mawhinney ambles over to ask how we got on in the presidential suite. \"We had a bit of a laugh,\" I say. Mawhinney grins though gritted teeth. His own meeting with Blatter's sidekick, in the ongoing battle between Fifa and English football, was \"very focused\" - if typically frustrating. \"We were a little short on laughter, actually ...\" \"Ask Blatter about his love-life next time,\" I suggest. Mawhinney smiles wearily. \"I'll think about it . . .\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
