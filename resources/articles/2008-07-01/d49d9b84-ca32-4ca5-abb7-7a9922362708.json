Since then their professional relationship has changed dramatically. There will be no such cosiness this time. Instead Federer has been sent packing from Canada several days early and Nadal has jetted in behind him, preparing for the chance to push in front of the world No1 and bring the biggest upheaval in the rankings for four and a half years. Federer would have to lose before the semi-finals in the Masters Series here for that to happen this week. But whether he does or not, the pressure from such a possible sea-change has never been greater, nor could the timing of it have been worse. Almost immediately after the loss of his Wimbledon title Federer is fighting the fear of another crushing blow and, wisely chosen though his words have been, the mask they seek to maintain is evident. \"It's the start of a hard-court season of eight or nine months. So I hope I can start well,\" he said, conveniently dropping the opening chapter of last week's loss to Gilles Simon, and reversing the telescope to project the sequence into the distance beyond the impending Olympics and US Open. \"Maybe there's a little bit of extra pressure,\" he admitted, \"but at the same time you know you are on a winning streak at this tournament.\" In fact Federer won here last year and before that in 2005. But in 12 tournaments this year he has won just two, Estoril and Halle. Still, he is better rested than Nadal, and is possibly still the favourite despite all his disappointments this year. And revealing though his perspectives are, they are the best available. How much extra pressure was there, he was asked. \"I don't know if there is more pressure than Wimbledon,\" he said. \"When I go out there I expect to win the match, win the tournament. It's not anything new that the No1 position looks in more danger than in the past. I have to focus and look at the big picture, and prepare well and not go crazy over it.\" And there were other clever deflections. His rivalry with Nadal was greater than the legendary one between McEnroe and Borg, he pointed out, because they had played each other so many more times, 20 times (it's actually 18). \"And we have the feeling it will happen another 20 times. We are right in the prime of the rivalry.\" Message to himself here: time to make amends. To do so here Federer may have to survive a last 16 meeting with Ivo Karlovic, the steepest server on the tour, and a quarter-final with Andy Roddick, a former champion here. As for Nadal, he spent every day last week saying he was world No2 and content to be so, and he is still saying it. So often has he denied that No1 has even crossed his mind, that the prospect has become all the greater."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
