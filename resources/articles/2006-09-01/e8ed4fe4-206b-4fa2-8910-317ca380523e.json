The venue might have been Old Labour - the TUC building - but inside the conference was New Labour to its polished toes: earnest young suits, a whooping standing ovation, perky pop tunes - although 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered' was perhaps not a tactful choice. Tony Blair, however, would probably have smiled. He made enough jokes against himself yesterday, addressing the faithful of the Progress think-tank annual conference in an off-the-cuff swansong that ranged from self-deprecatory humour to an impassioned intellectual defence of New Labour. He concluded with a coded warning to the man once popularly supposed to be his inevitable successor, Gordon Brown, against 'old-fashioned' plotting. Last week, the Prime Minister gave up his fight to cling on to power. The delegate yesterday who called for him to change his mind - 'Doing things that people don't like, with you being leader we will still win' - raised indulgent laughter, but no more. Once he had publicly eaten his words and given the signal that he would be gone within a year - precisely what he had said he wouldn't do only the week before - Blair brought down the curtain on his own career. His authority shattered, he knows his tenure will last only months. But he hasn't given up the fight for his party. The fear is that, in so humbling Blair, Brown has also been mortally wounded - portrayed as a blackmailing backstabber, not the statesmanlike heir apparent - with any vestige of a stable transition of power written off. 'Tony knows it's over for him,' says one confidant. 'He is liberated. He has got a miserable decision to make, which is \"I'm a lame duck: do I go now and move on? Do I stay on a bit longer?\". But there is nothing more they can do to Tony. Brown, however, is now going to face a great number of people who will really, really blame him for what happened.' And that has started some of Brown's sworn enemies thinking the unthinkable: could the Chancellor yet find his prize slipping away at the last minute? 'Tony hasn't got a future: this is not about Tony,' says one cabinet minister now involved in looking for a rival candidate to back. 'What we have got to do is make sure Labour looks for somebody who is trustworthy, honest and straight.' The past week, he suggested, had shown Brown was none of those. The rebels responded with equal force: MPs are threatening to march on Downing Street demanding Blair quit, if there are further attacks on Brown. And so a week that began in farce, with a leaked memo outlining how Blair could 'leave them wanting more', like an ageing rock star, ends in something darker: the whiff of mutually assured destruction. Blair yesterday appealed for an end to the savagery. But he may not be heard. The danger of a long summer is it leaves disgruntled MPs with too much time on their hands. Among those who spent August fretting over the still unresolved issue of the Prime Minister's departure was Chris Bryant, the ex-vicar turned MP still best known for posting a photo of himself in his underpants on a gay website. Until recently, he was a ministerial aide to Lord Falconer. Once an ardent Blairite, his career had already stalled when, disillusioned, he resigned at the end of July. Friends say he had warned Falconer that Labour was just treading water while it waited for Blair to go: frustrated at not being taken seriously, he quit. But it took last Thursday's Times interview - in which Blair briskly opened the post-holiday political season by refusing to say this month's party conference would be his last - to prod Bryant into action. What irritated him most was the notion that those opposed to Blair must be Old Labourites. He rang Tom Watson, a junior defence minister who is so close to Brown that the two have been known to phone each other 10 times in a day. Bryant suggested to Watson writing a private letter to Blair requesting he clarify his intentions. Such a letter from impeccably New Labour names would show how far concern had spread. Watson agreed, although friends say he did not expect to find his own name on the list. Signatures were gathered, while Bryant's friend Sion Simon MP helped the pair with drafting. But crucially, Bryant never meant the letter to become public, not least so that those involved would not lose their jobs. Unfortunately by Monday, news of its existence was on the front pages. A panicking Bryant emailed the letter to Keith Hill, Blair's PPS, and rang the head of the political office, John McTernan, who failed to call back. For several hours, Number 10 insisted there was no such letter. But by then the simultaneous leak of the memo to the Mirror, detailing how Blair should leave office on a wave of euphoria, had made them look desperately out of touch. Was the double-whammy orchestrated by the Chancellor? Had he really instigated the letter, it would have had a lot more than 17 names - but his supporters appear to have exploited it once they heard of it. 'Watson doesn't break wind in the morning unless he's checked with Gordon,' said one senior minister. Yet even at this stage, Blair was still anxious to avoid a public statement: as a compromise, the Environment Secretary and Blair protege, David Miliband, was sent on to the air waves to say Blair would be gone within the year. It might have worked, had a much bigger plot not been unfolding. Last July, rumours began circling Westminster of at least one letter being prepared within the Trade Union group of mainstream leftwing MPs demanding a timetable for Blair's departure. Over the summer, at least three other informal groupings of MPs began working on similar ideas. They coalesced fatally, however, only after the Times interview - and Blairite ex-minister Alan Milburn's suggestion that the rebels should 'put up or shut up'. They chose to put up. Shortly after 7.30am on Wednesday morning, the Prime Minister entered the Chancellor's office at Number 11 for one of the most important showdowns of their lives. It did not begin well. Watson's name was by now public. 'Brown was playing the card that \"If you don't back off, Tommy Watson will resign\",' says one Cabinet source.' Tony basically said, Fuck off.' Watson would be sacked anyway, he told Brown. Other sources say Brown yelled at Blair that he must quit by Christmas, or there would be 'rolling resignations' among ministers for days in protest. He also apparently demanded the muzzling of Milburn and Stephen Byers; a personal endorsement; and more involvement in government decisions. Blair told him he was 'not in a position' to insist Brown succeed him and that the government could not have two masters. The Brown camp says this version is 'utter rubbish'. The meeting broke up without a deal: at one point, the whips' office is said to have been worried there would be a contest under way by the end of the day. Sensing the end was near, Blair remained oddly calm: he spent the next few hours sitting in the Downing Street garden, working on his Middle East peace plan. 'He was fatalistic. He thought he could face this down, but was quite \"que sera, que sera\" about it' says an old friend who spoke to him that day. And the pressure did grow. Watson had to resign, but his incendiary statement - 'I share the view of the overwhelming majority of the party and the country' that a new leader was essential - caught Downing Street by surprise. Blair immediately issued a furious attack on the 'disloyal and discourteous' Watson. This was the most dangerous moment of the day. Angry at being blamed for plotting and smarting over losing Watson, Brownite MPs gathered for a council of war at which a coup was seriously discussed. Meanwhile, the threatened delegation was growing bigger: at least 80 names were apparently ready to go public, plus almost another 50 senior figures - including at least three ministers - whose names would be private. Blair called another meeting at 2pm. Two hours later, a deal emerged under which he would confirm he was out in less than a year, but set no date; in return, Brown would pledge the public support he had withheld all week. The meeting closed, according to insiders, with Blair suggesting that the ball was in Brown's court but that he wasn't 'prepared to be bundled out'. Overnight, however, the sands shifted. The next day's front pages were bad for the Chancellor, using a photograph of him grinning broadly to suggest he was gloating. In fact, he had been sharing a joke with his assistant, Sue Nye: but calls to Labour HQ in Newcastle were running 80:20 against Brown. Could the deal be unpicked? Eventually, aides decided not. Brown went first, declaring in Glasgow that he had 'had questions' about the departure date, but now endorsed Blair's right to decide his own exit. Blair was humbler, apologising for his party's behaviour and joking about how much the unions disliked him. But was it enough? By now, Brown was as alarmed as Blair was at the way things were spiralling out of control. 'It was like that scene from Reservoir Dogs where everybody had a gun trained on everybody else and they all started blasting away at each other blindly,' says one party source. Similarly, the organisers of the parliamentary revolt called a halt, deciding Blair was damaged enough. 'There was no need to tar and feather him,' says one. Nonetheless, even this truce cracked within hours. First, the BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, reported an unnamed cabinet minister saying Brown would be an 'effing disaster' as leader: MPs suspected Home Secretary, John Reid. Then Charles Clarke plonked a finger on Brown's sorest spot: the question of his temperament. Denouncing him as 'absolutely stupid' for being photographed grinning and a 'control freak' who was impossible to work with, Clarke questioned whether he was 'fit to govern'. The character issue will now form the heart of the leadership contest. So is Brown the brooding obsessive his critics describe, trusting only a tiny clique, harbouring grudges and plotting behind backs rather than dealing face to face? Or is he, as his friends insist, an intellectual who adores a good argument, has mellowed with fatherhood and is wrongly blamed by paranoid Blairites for everything? For the cabal seeking to stop him, the past week has proved their worst fears about what one describes as Brown's 'display of petulance'. They accuse him of being unable to trust anyone, furiously defensive - and lethal when provoked. 'They will do anything, say anything, to stop people they see as being in their way,' says a cabinet source. Civil servants, too, have criticised his style of working, arguing that the enmity between the two men has hamstrung the government on important issues, while Brown and Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff, are said not to have spoken for 12 years. Another minister cites what he says is Brown's tendency to self-doubt, leading him to overplay his hand when he feels threatened. 'If you are far and away the leading candidate, you'll win. He doesn't need to do all of this.' To which, Brownites retort: remember your history. This week was, the Chancellor believes, the fifth time his one-time friend has tried to renege on a deal over when to quit, so how can he relax? His friends insist Brown is being unfairly caricatured in a race that has become bitterly focused on personality issues because there are so few significant policy worries. Ruth Kelly, the Communities Secretary, worked closely with him at the Treasury and cites his 'huge sense of purpose' and 'brilliant strategic sense' of the future. Those who caricature him as stubborn are wrong, she told The Observer: ' I have always found him really easy to work with and willing to take on ideas.' The Prime Minister's own attitude towards his old friend is harder to quantify. There is little love lost this week: after Wednesday's bruising encounters, Blair turned to one old friend and said: \"I had never known how mendacious he was, how full of mendacity.' But he remains more tolerant of Brown than do many of his allies. He does, however, believe Brown must choose between keeping the New Labour momentum going - more tax reform, welfare state reform, private sector provision, all of which he listed yesterday as priorities - and a less ambitious unifying agenda. Nonetheless, Blair did not seek to collapse the house of cards once again: Clarke was almost certainly acting on his own initiative by trashing Brown. So was it sheer coincidence that he attacked just as Blairite ministers were casting around for someone enough to run against Brown? By Friday morning, the phone lines between senior ministers and confidants of Blair were running hot - with Clarke included in the discussions. The only question: had Brown overreached himself enough to fall vulnerable to a challenger? And if so, who? Of the four names on their shortlist - Clarke, John Reid, Alan Johnson and Alan Milburn - none is a safe bet. Reid has shed popularity with MPs during his struggles with the Home Office; Milburn's resignation as Health Secretary over family pressures would almost certainly be used against him. Clarke, meanwhile, would probably face gossip about his fondness for red wine. Within hours of his outburst, Brown supporters were saying pointedly that Clarke 'was interviewed after lunch' - code at Westminster, where long, boozy lunches used to be the norm. Johnson is the least experienced, but - like John Major before him - has therefore made the fewest enemies. But is such talk realistic, given Brown's commanding lead in the race and the strength of his powerbase? The fear that it is not, combined with the fear of laying waste the party around him, may have prompted determined efforts yesterday to shut down the row, with Blair ringing Clarke and ministers to ask them to keep quiet. MPs have been told he even had an emotional confrontation with Peter Mandelson late on Friday night, asking him to let it go. 'Apparently Peter was saying it was a disgrace what they had done to him, he couldn't let it pass, and Tony just said: \"Peter, it's over\",' reports one party source. Not everyone, however, appears ready to give in. The MPs behind the delegation plot will decide tomorrow what to do next, depending on whether the peace holds. But Clarke is not the only one tempted to have one last gamble - and enjoy a little revenge. 'I think Gordon's blown it. He will have thought this week would be the demise of Tony - but it could well turn out to be the demise of Gordon, too,' said a cabinet colleague, and his voice was grim."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
