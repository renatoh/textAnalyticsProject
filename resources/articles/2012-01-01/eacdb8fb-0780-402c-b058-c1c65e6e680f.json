Hughes succeeded Neil Warnock on Tuesday and takes charge of his first match at Newcastle United on Sunday. Asked if the manager would stay regardless of relegation, Beard said: \"I hope so. As far as I'm concerned, Mark is here now to help us fulfil both on the pitch what we want to achieve and help me with his expertise and his team implementing a training ground we can be proud of for the club.\" But pressed if the 47-year-old would be sacked if QPR, who are 17th, did go down, Beard did not rule out the prospect: \"The aim is that Mark is here for a very long time and sees through the objectives and the aims. My job is to try to do that off the pitch and I hope we've found the manager \u2013 the right person \u2013 to come and do it for us on the pitch. \"Every football club \u2013 and there are probably 12 or 13 of them \u2013 have got to contemplate what happens if they don't perform as well as they need to on the pitch. That doesn't mean our shareholders go away and we pack up our bags and don't implement what we've been talking about. I'm a small cog in the wheel but I came here because I believe that the shareholders have got a vision that they want to implement.\" Regarding Hughes having a release clause in his contract, Beard said: \"Not that I know about.\" He added that he has made contingency plans for relegation. \"My job is to make sure that the business can be effective for the medium- and long-term,\" he said. \"I look at business plans all the time and contingency plans. I hope what we've done over the last couple of days means that I don't have to get those numbers out. But I'd be crazy to say that I haven't even thought about what we'd be doing if we didn't stay in the Premier League.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
