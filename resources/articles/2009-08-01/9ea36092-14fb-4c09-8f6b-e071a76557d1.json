The Rugby Football Union is to set up a taskforce incorporating some high-profile figures, and it has confirmed that Harlequins will escape further sanctions over the fake-blood saga that landed their director of rugby, Dean Richards, a three-year ban. The RFU could not allow the damaging publicity of recent weeks to continue without acting. The union's disciplinary officer, Judge Jeff Blackett, remains up to his waist in issues that reflect poorly on numerous individuals. It is a depressing sign of the times that Blackett has opted to take no further action against Quins players involved in four previous instances of blood-related skulduggery spread over four years, largely on the basis that several other clubs appear to have been guilty of similar misdemeanours. Precise details of the players and matches involved have still to be released, but a clearer picture of the systematic cheating encouraged during Richards's time at Harlequins has emerged. As long ago as the 2005-06 season, when Quins were in National League One, a fake blood gauze was issued at half-time to an unwell player who was subsequently replaced. Subsequently, two other players were given fake blood, either in gauze or capsule form, before the scam was exposed following the now infamous Heineken Cup quarter-final against Leinster at the Stoop last season. It is the view of Judge Blackett, however, that it would not be \"in the best interests of the game or the union\" to identify the players involved or to initiate fresh disciplinary proceedings. \"It is apparent from evidence provided to the Harlequins internal review that Harlequins is not the only club which may have been guilty of inappropriate behaviour of a similar kind,\" Blackett said. Also part of the rationale is that Richards and Steph Brennan, the former Quins physiotherapist, were the instigators of the scam and have already been punished \"significantly\". Any further action against the players would inevitably require co-operation from both Richards and Brennan, which, according to Blackett, \"would take some time and continue to attract comment and speculation which might further damage reputations\". The players concerned might also struggle to receive a fair hearing, and continuing media speculation could deter other players from assisting the taskforce with its inquiries. The union has decided it would be wiser to declare an amnesty in order to clear up a murky area of the game. The make-up of the taskforce is to be decided, but the RFU's chief executive, Francis Baron, said: \"The review will be wide-ranging, thorough, and the recommendations in the best interests of the whole game.\" Harlequins will breath a sigh of relief. The worst-case scenario would have been a points deduction and/or the loss of their Heineken Cup status given that a blood capsule was administered to a player during the course of last season's Guinness Premiership campaign. They appear to have weathered the worst of the storm. Will Skinner, the club's captain, insisted there was no rift between the squad and wing Tom Williams, whose evidence hastened Richards's resignation. Williams has had his ban reduced from 12 months to four on appeal, with the full written judgment to be released in the next 24 hours. Quins will take their time before confirming whether Ian McGeechan is to be their new director of rugby. McGeechan has reportedly been offered an 18-month deal but the Lions head coach is about to go on holiday and will not be in charge for Quins' opening league game against his former club Wasps at Twickenham on Saturday week. \"I do have one or two irons in the fire but I will not be rushing into any decisions,\" said McGeechan yesterday. South Africa's federation and several players, meanwhile, have been fined after they wore armbands featuring the word \"Justice\" before and during the third Test defeat by the Lions last month. They were protesting against a suspension given to Bakkies Botha. SARU was fined \u00a310,000 and each player who wore an armband \u00a3200, except the captain, John Smit, who must pay \u00a31,000. The International Rugby Board said it was \"extremely disappointed\" at the sanctions and will consider appealing against their leniency."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
