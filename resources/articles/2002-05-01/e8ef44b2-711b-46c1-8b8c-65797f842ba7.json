As the passengers headed across the gleaming new marble floor of Prague's International Airport just after 7.40pm on Friday, she greeted them with the news that Go flight 281 to London would leave on time at 9.40pm. Like many passengers booked on the two-hour flight, I was a veteran of the 'no-frills' airline revolution. I first travelled on the fledgling Ryanair in June 1991, when few people outside Ireland had heard of the tiny airline. Now the company, and a string of other low-cost carriers, have become synonymous with the new generation of British and European travellers with a voracious appetite for budget fares. In return for cut-price seats to exotic locations, they have increasingly come to accept occasional delays and the complete lack of luxury on board. Travel with flaws is better than expense. I had paid \u00a3346 in March for two return tickets - the second a Christmas present for my mother. We stayed for five days and arrived at the airport early on Friday evening. By 9pm rumours spread of 'serious problems' in UK air space and lengthy delays. A businessman confirmed the worst shortly afterwards; the new national air traffic control computer system at Swanwick had crashed for the third time in as many months. Despite having prior knowledge of the chaos, airlines, including Go, decided not to pass the information on to its passengers. By midnight in Prague, more than 80 people were stretched out on the floors with flight monitors simply insisting 'delay'. At 1am, the monitor revealed that the flight was due to leave London at 4.35am to pick up its passengers in the Czech Republic. In more than 10 hours spent at the airport, there had not been a single announcement about flight 281, no ground staff were present to help increasingly anxious passengers and nobody was available to answer the UK and Czech inquiry lines. Staff manning the information desks shrugged when asked for help in locating Go officials. The airline seemed to have vanished. As we trudged off the plane at Stansted airport yesterday morning, it still seemed as if it was possible to argue that the Prague incident was a one-off. Airlines could blame it on the collapse of the traffic control system and argue they were powerless to help their distressed customers, but it is not that simple. The Observer has been provided with a disturbing insight of the current state of the 'no-frills' industry amid growing concerns that airlines are turning what should have been a cheaper golden age of travel into one of the most unpleasant experiences people can have. A senior industry source with experience of managing major UK airports said: 'Stress is going through the roof on all fronts. Airlines have got to the point where they no longer give a shit about their passengers. To them, it's a taxi service, where all they want to do is ferry people from A to B then leave them on their own for someone else to deal with. 'They've been squeezing every last drop of profit from their customers while forgetting they're supposed to look after people and treat them with decency. 'I've seen OAPs, the sick and the vulnerable wandering dazed and confused around airport terminals because there is simply no staff available to deal with their welfare or onward arrangements. Check-in staff, already suffering extremely high levels of stress, simply have no time to deal with people like that.' Furthermore, the growth of no-frills travel is expected to increase 40-fold over the next decade and there will be serious problems ahead. 'What started as an exciting adventure to break the monopoly of the big airlines has turned into a gold rush among the no-frills carriers, where avarice at the expense of decency has become the major driver in the travel sector,' the source said. 'It's a shame and if they think it will last forever, they are sorely mistaken - because people will eventually say enough is enough.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
