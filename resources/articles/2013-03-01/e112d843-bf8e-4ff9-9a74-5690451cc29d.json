Machineries of Joy skitters all over the place: from the uplifting chorus, cheerful rhythm and bright guitars of the title track to the gloomy thud of the final song, its shrill, three-note riff anxious and spooked; from the boyish eruption of K Hole, all buzz and thrash, to the tender quiet of What You Need the Most, an almost admonitory love song to a \"Pyrex baby\" who keeps getting smashed. For all its shifts and quirks, it's a more cohesive album than its predecessor, 2011's Valhalla Dancehall, thanks mostly to the keening viola of Abi Fry, a will-o'the-wisp dancing from song to song; and to crisp editing that keeps experimentation on a taut leash. Loving Animals is all the more blissful for that precision, its gritty verses and swooning chorus underscored with the yowl of donkeys and flap of wings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
