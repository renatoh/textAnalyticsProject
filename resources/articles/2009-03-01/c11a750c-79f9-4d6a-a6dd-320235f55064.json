Agreement on a deal was still awaited last night amid speculation that Lloyds would be forced to convert the \u00a34bn of preference shares the government already owns into ordinary equity, giving the taxpayer a stake of more than 60% in the bank. Any decision to relinquish majority control to the government will pile further pressure on the chairman, Sir Victor Blank, who played a crucial role in securing the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB at the height of the banking crisis. The \u00a310.8bn of losses inside HBOS \u2013 larger than originally thought \u2013 have forced the enlarged Lloyds to admit that it will be driven to a loss in 2009 and the takeover is the main reason for Lloyds involvement in talks about participating in the so-called asset protection scheme. Lloyds' management had been discussing a range of options in an attempt to keep the government stake at the current 43% \u2013 or at least below 50% \u2013 but that is thought to be proving increasingly difficult. Eric Daniels, chief executive, is thought to be particularly anxious not to have the taxpayer as a majority investor but the government is keen to take a larger stake to give it greater ability to demand that the bank steps up lending to companies and households. Despite hopes that a deal would finally be announced today, there was no certainty last night that an agreement would be concluded before the weekend. Anxiety about the failure to clinch a deal a week ago, when Lloyds announced its 2008 figures, has forced down the share price of Lloyds, which ended tonight at 40.3p, down 7.40p. The falling share price means that if Lloyds does decide to convert the preference shares into ordinary shares it would be handing the government a larger stake than it would have done if a deal could have been agreed earlier in the year. Barclays shares were also sharply lower today amid concern that it would be difficult for it to agree terms to participate in the asset protection scheme. Sandy Chen, banks analyst at Panmure Gordon, calculated that Barclays would take impairment charges of \u00a313bn this year and next \u2013 \u00a35bn-\u00a36bn higher than expectations \u2013 and that the bank will record \"major losses\" in 2009 and 2010. \"If Barclays decides not to participate in the government asset protection scheme, we see additional capital/dilution risk as well. We cut our share price target from 55p to 40p,\" Chen said. Barclays shares fell 20.8p to 65.50p. Barclays is expected to enter negotiations about the asset protection scheme shortly after the Treasury completes negotiations with Lloyds, which has insisted that the only reason a deal was not done last week was because Treasury officials were too exhausted after round-the-clock talks with Royal Bank of Scotland. Under the terms being considered by Lloyds, it is possible that the government's economic stake in the bank would rise beyond 70% through the issue of B shares, which receive dividends but do not carry voting rights. A spokesman for Lloyds, who would not comment on the detail of talks, said: \"We continue our discussions with the Treasury and there is still a good deal of detail to be resolved.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
