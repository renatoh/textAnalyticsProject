Liz Cottriel and Julie McSorley told the Fresno-area Fox affiliate that they were watching whales from a distance of about 30ft (9.14 meters) during what appeared to be a peaceful morning near Avila beach. Everything changed when a large pool of fish emerged. \u201cI saw the big pool of fish, the big bait ball come up out of the water. I saw the whale come up \u2026 I thought, \u2018Oh no! It\u2019s too close\u2019,\u201d McSorley told the news station. \u201cAll of a sudden, I lifted up, and I was in the water.\u201d Cottriel reportedly commented: \u201cI\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018I\u2019m gonna push\u2019. Like, I\u2019m gonna push a whale out of the way! It was the weirdest thought. I\u2019m thinking, \u2018I\u2019m dead. I\u2019m dead\u2019. I thought it was gonna land on me.\u201d The women surfaced and shortly thereafter, other kayakers and paddleboarders came to help them \u2013 and make sure that the whale hadn\u2019t bitten them, the news station reported. \u201cThey thought the whale had the kayak in its mouth,\u201d McSorley remarked. She recorded the incident on her mobile phone in a video which has since gone viral. They paddled to shore and were apparently unharmed, though McSorley\u2019s car keys were lost, according to the report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
