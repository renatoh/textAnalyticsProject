He told MPs he agreed with the conclusion of the Bain report on the firefighters' pay claim in that legislative changes were needed to modernise the service. Warning the Fire Brigades Union that it could not hide from reform, he said the government was committed to creating \"a modern emergency fire and rescue service focused on the safety of people and communities\". Mr Prescott said Sir George Bain's proposals - an 11% pay rise over two years dependent on modernisation - were acceptable to the government. He said ministers would provide a \"small amount of transitional funding\" to help local authorities implement the self-financing deal. He said: \"The Bain report is a challenge for us all - the government, the fire authorities and fire service personnel. \"But it is a challenge the government is determined to meet. \"The report provides a fair deal for the firefighters, a fair deal for other workers and a fair deal for the economy. \"Above all, it will provide a better service to the people of this country.\" Mr Prescott said the report found fire service legislation and management practice were \"out of date\" and the rules and regulations governing its overall framework and day-to-day work of the fire service were \"old fashioned and restrictive\". Mr Prescott said the government had agreed to repeal section 19 of the 1947 Fire Services Act \"at the earliest opportunity\". The law - requiring the secretary of state's consent for any reduction in the number of fire stations, appliances or jobs - made it difficult to modernise \"on the ground\". Many of the report's other recommendations for legislative changes would require \"detailed consideration\", he said. But the government accepted in principle the need for a new legal framework \"to improve inspection and delivery of services and set up a new central body to drive forward modernisation\". A white paper detailing the changes needed would be published in the spring, he said. \"This is a clear programme of reform which will be taken forward immediately and will sustain the drive to modernise the framework in which the fire service operates. \"My guiding principle will be to transform the fire service into a modern emergency fire and rescue service focused on the safety of people and communities.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
