It was taken in a pub in Fulham, London. The woman is Lynn Seymour, who I was married to at the time. They were doing Romeo and Juliet together, and they used to get on well; we used to go out drinking together all the time. Rudi was a great laugh, very outspoken \u2013 if something wasn\u2019t right, he\u2019d really lay down the law. He was fantastically bright, spoke six languages, and had an animal magnetism: you couldn\u2019t take your eyes off him when he was on stage. I was a dancer myself. I joined the Royal Ballet School in 1953, but by 1962 I had started work as a professional photographer. I didn\u2019t really like ballet that much \u2013 I couldn\u2019t take the tension. You\u2019ve got to be very self-assured. There was no paparazzi in those days. I just asked the bloke at the bar if I could take a few pictures, and he said fine. What I love about it is those people at the next table: they are just having a quiet drink and didn\u2019t know or care about Nureyev, even though he was all over the papers. The thing is, dancers always want to look perfect, and I like taking pictures when they\u2019re off guard, working in difficult places or in rough environments. What I wanted to show was that, for all the glamour, there\u2019s a lot of hard work. I wasn\u2019t getting on too well with Lynn at the time; in fact, we broke up shortly afterwards. Before I took this shot, I went with Nureyev and another woman to buy an expensive waterski boat in Ruislip or somewhere. She was all over him in the car, but of course he wasn\u2019t interested.
