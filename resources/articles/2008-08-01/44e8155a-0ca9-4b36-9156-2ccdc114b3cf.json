The Tory leader also called for Moscow to be suspended from the G8 group of industrial nations and for its talks on a partnership agreement with the EU to be frozen. Writing in the Sunday Times, Cameron said it was time for the international community to unite behind measures to show disapproval of Russia's actions. 'We must make clear that the path it has chosen leads to isolation and contempt. We should suspend Russia from the G8 and suspend negotiations on a partnership with the European Union,' he said. Russia's elite valued their ties to Europe, particularly 'their shopping and their luxury weekends'. He added: 'Russian armies can't march into other countries while Russian shoppers carry on marching into Selfridges.' Earlier yesterday, Cameron was accused of 'macho posturing' after staging a surprise visit to Georgia to declare solidarity with its citizens. Cameron embarrassed the government by beating ministers to the capital, Tbilisi, for meetings with Georgian leaders on a trip designed to portray him as a potential Prime Minister. However, Downing Street aides said that he had waded into a volatile situation for the sake of a 'photo opportunity', while the Liberal Democrats accused him of raising expectations of Nato membership for the former Soviet satellite that were 'simply not credible'. Cameron insisted that he was there to show support for a threatened democracy and raised fears over reports of what he described as 'appalling atrocities' allegedly carried out by militias in Russian-occupied areas. He said: 'What is required is a very strong response to what is happening. If we just stand by after what Russia has done in Georgia, then where next will Russia intervene?' The Foreign Office, which was anxious about Cameron's trip, is likely to have been mollified by his pointed insistence yesterday that he was representing 'the British people, the British government and the British opposition'. He is understood to have taken advice from the British embassy on the latest developments. However, he repeated his controversial view that Nato membership for Georgia was now 'appropriate'. The Tory leader's visit has irritated Gordon Brown, who has spoken repeatedly to Georgian leaders by phone and is said to be monitoring developments closely while on holiday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
