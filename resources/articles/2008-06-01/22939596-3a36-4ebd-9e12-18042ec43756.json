After the posthumous publication of End Games, the final Aurelio Zen mystery by Michael Dibdin, comes the postmortem appearance of the last DI Frost investigation from RD Wingfield. Hospitals and morgues have been regular locations in the Frost books, but knowing that the author began this story after being diagnosed with the cancer that killed him, it is hard not to feel an extra layer of contemplation in the numerous scenes that require the cop to contemplate a sick or dead body. And given that a typical sentence involves Frost trying to put a sausage sandwich and his latest cigarette in his mouth simultaneously, there also seems to be a considerable risk that the central character will himself end up in a clinic or fridge. Even if he doesn't, the DI is faced with another kind of termination: Chief Inspector Skinner, a boorish reformer, has arrived with a mission to drive Frost from the force, confident of beginning disciplinary proceedings, whether over Frost's insolence, mistakes caused by his tendency to trust his \"feelings\", or 30 years of expenses claims as fictional as anything in this book. The new broom/old lag dynamic is a crime genre standby. Yet, though death-drenched and possibly a conscious memento mori from the author, the book is perversely exuberant. The word is that Wingfield found novels difficult and his CV supports this view: he published only six Frost books, even though the TV series in which David Jason plays the policeman would have created a market for at least one a year. A Killing Frost, despite being composed in circumstances that provided every excuse for slowing down, is almost swaggeringly fluent and fast-paced. Wingfield favoured multiple storylines and, in this case, the narrative is ingeniously pieced together from fragments of apparently unrelated cases. As the book begins, Frost is faced with a serial rapist, the discovery of mutilated body parts in a field, a missing baby, three teenagers absent without leave and extortion demands to a supermarket. Even as some of these strands begin to unravel or overlap, others are added, including a paedophile ring and a butcher who may or may not have murdered his wife. Wingfield negotiates the puzzle of which of these crimes are linked and which coincidental with exemplary skill and control. The concern, as always, is the toxic sexism of Frost, a character considerably sanitised for television. Apart from the special handful who are addressed as \"tart\", all women are described by Frost as \"cow\" or \"bitch\", even when they have been killed or sexually assaulted. Shockingly, the detective even engages in flirtatious banter with a 15-year-old who has just been raped. The queasiness for the reader is whether Wingfield, in such moments, is with or against his main creation. Clearly aware of this difficulty, the writer varies point-of-view so that a female witness, after meeting Frost, is handed the next paragraph to reflect that he is \"foul-mouthed, uncouth and insufferable\". We are also party to Frost's own reflections on dead or missing children, which help to humanise him. Even so, Frost remains by far the most unattractive cop in mainstream crime fiction. Yet this is a fitting memorial to a clever writer with an appealing line in cheekiness: can it be an accident that one of the murder victims has the name of a bestselling crime writer?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
