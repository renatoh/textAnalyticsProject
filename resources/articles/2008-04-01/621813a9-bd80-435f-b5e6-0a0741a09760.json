Rather than a feast of Grand Guignol for which Holby has become known - only recently Nurse Chrissie was strapped down in theatre by a deranged doctor and mutilated with a scalpel - we have instead quite possibly the most boring episode ever. Not even an old lady impaled on her knitting needles can raise the pulse of this DOA hour of non-drama, which also sees the return of Adrian Edmondson. Try to contain your excitement. Back Story: The Soul of Stax 9pm, SkyArts Over on BBC2 at 10pm, Jools Holland plays host to James, alt-rockers the Gutter Twins and blues vocalist Mable John, while this fine film casts its eye back to the origins of the legendary record label, home to the likes of Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes. Stax was at the forefront of the civil rights movement before going bankrupt in the 1970s. Awash with the Memphis sound - Redding's Respect Yourself and (Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay stand out - this is a real gem. Scallywagga 10.30pm, BBC3 Though there are mildly amusing moments in this sketch show - there's a neat riff on the evils of catchphrase comedy - it's unlikely to have you laughing out loud. Indeed, you may barely raise a smirk at some of the shenanigans as, despite some likable talent involved - including ex-Corrie actor Sally Lindsay - it consists mostly of the sweepings from the floor of Green Wing and Smack the Pony, on which writer Stuart Kenworthy worked before. Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent 11pm, Five Rather confusingly, Goren and Eames, who used to work every week when this particular spin-off of Dick Wolf's mighty L&amp;O mothership show began, now job-share with Mr Big from Sex and the City and Annabella Sciorra, with each pair working out each week how to clean up New York's streets. This week, with Goren on duty, there are rum doings at an opera house when a violinist is murdered, probably by guest star Julian Sands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
