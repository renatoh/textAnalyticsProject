Talks are at an advanced stage and United's chief executive Peter Kenyon hopes to tell Sir Alex Ferguson early next week that a deal has been done, starting extensive recruitment that could see Ronaldinho, the French forward David Bellion and the United States goalkeeper Tim Howard all signing within a fortnight of one another. Ronaldinho's brother and agent Roberto Assis said yesterday that the chase for the Brazilian forward was now down to a three-horse race between United, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain, his current club. This confirmed that Real Madrid have dropped their interest after signing Beckham. Assis was due to meet Barcelona's vice-president Sandro Rosell last night after Cameroon's 1-0 Confederations Cup match victory over the world champions Brazil in Paris, although he said no decision would be announced until after the tournament finished on June 29. On the way out of United might be Diego Forlan, who is attracting tentative interest from Sevilla and would be surplus to the champions' requirements after scoring only nine goals in 63 appearances since arriving for \u00a37.5m. Sevilla's technical director Ramon Rodriguez yesterday confirmed the club's interest in Forlan. \"The first step has already been taken,\" he said. But United have repelled an inquiry on behalf of Juventus about Juan Sebastian Veron, emphasising he is not for sale even if Lilian Thuram or Edgar Davids are used as bait in a possible player-plus-cash exchange. Djemba-Djemba, despite his nickname, is not renowned for his creativity or inspiration but as an industrious holding midfielder with a talent for breaking down attacks. By targeting a player much in the mould of Roy Keane - Djemba-Djemba totalled one red and 11 yellow cards last season - Ferguson is acknowledging that his battle-scarred captain may no longer be equipped to last a full season. It also adds credibility to the theory that, in the Champions League, Ferguson plans to field two holding midfielders in the fluid 4-2-3-1 system favoured by Real rather than his traditional 4-4-2. \"The clubs have been in talks for a while,\" said the player's agent Willie McKay, \"United have made their intentions clear and Eric is desperate to go.\" Sylvie Poulmarch, the Nantes spokesman, said: \"It could cer tainly happen next week.\" McKay also claimed United were monitoring another Cameroon international, the striker Samuel Eto'o, who scored last night's winner in the Stade de France. \"Samuel's got three years left on his contract but he's desperate to come to the Premiership,\" McKay said. \"I've put him forward to United and they've watched him recently. The problem is that Real Mallorca want \u00a310m for him.\" Ferguson should also be encouraged by the fact that Djemba-Djemba grew up as a United fan. Meanwhile Ferguson is understood to have interrupted his holiday in the south of France to have lunch with Bellion on Monday and the forward agreed to sign once his contract with Sunderland expires in 10 days' time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
