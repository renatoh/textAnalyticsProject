Cellino was disqualified as president for 79 days last month until 10 April, after a failed appeal, but is taking \u201cindependent action\u201d against the League and will wait before returning as the club\u2019s owner so as to help United avoid any sanctions. Cellino was convicted of tax evasion on his yacht, the Nelie, in 2012, an offence the League deemed dishonest \u2013 and therefore falling foul of its owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test \u2013 despite it being a first-grade conviction in Sardinia and not a final ruling. Cellino and Leeds could also face further punishment for alleged misconduct for failing to supply the Italian court judgment in the case \u2013 seen by the Guardian \u2013 to the Football League when it first became available last year. A statement from the Leeds chairman, Andrew Umbers, said Cellino was optimistic as to the outcome of a Rule K hearing. A Football Association Rule K hearing could see the Italian take the Football League to an independent arbitration tribunal. Cellino, who revealed he had sold a minority stake in the club after the League\u2019s ruling, is not permitted to be involved in the day-to-day running of Leeds. Since his hiatus Neil Redfearn\u2019s side have enjoyed an excellent run of form, until Tuesday night\u2019s loss at Brighton. Cellino wrote an open letter to the fans on the club\u2019s website on Tuesday night. It read: \u201cI have considered in the best interests of the club to postpone any release of my true thoughts and conclusion in relation to the 79 days disqualification verdict of the Football League and it was for not unsettling the harmony of the team in a period of key league tournament matches that I have measured to reveal my decision only today, because the qualification for the 2016 Championship is by now achieved. \u201cFor the reason above said, at first I suggested that my intention was to resume in April the office of president of Leeds after expiration of the disqualification term. I will not do so and I had actually decided not to do so in January already, soon after the confirmation by the Football League of its verdict. \u201cI wish to point out that I have immediately complied with all the requests of the Football League and, for such purposes, I instructed my consultants to arrange for all required actions in order to ensure my prompt exit from any management responsibility in the club. After a due process, I have also sold \u2013 with a clear harm to my interests \u2013 a minority stake in the club, so that in no way I could be prevented from freely acting as an independent citizen and individual before any authority.\u201d A separate statement from Umbers read: \u201cMassimo Cellino is taking this independent action so that LUFC is seen to be fully compliant with the Football League Rules and thus help the club avoid any sanctions. LUFC are optimistic as to the outcome of the disciplinary panel hearing and of the Rule K hearing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
