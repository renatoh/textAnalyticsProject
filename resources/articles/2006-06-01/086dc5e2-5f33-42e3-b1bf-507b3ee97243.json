The executive committee yesterday agreed to put forward proposals that would see independent professionals adjudicate on matters currently dealt with by executive committee members. The flaws in the current system were perfectly illustrated earlier this year when Jack Warner, a Fifa vice-president and advisor to the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Football Federation, was cleared of any wrongdoing in relation to a ticket touting scandal. All tickets for T&amp;T's World Cup matches were allocated to a travel company owned by the Warner family. Fifa's in-house ethics committee referred the matter to the executive committee, which cleared Warner after he revealed that his family had relinquished its interests in the firm. Meanwhile, Franco Carraro, forced to resign as head of the Italian FA amid allegations of match-fixing, continues as head of Fifa's audit committee. Carraro's troubles began after he took no action when first alerted to the scandals in Italian football. The audit committee which he heads was itself established following allegations that Sepp Blatter misused Fifa funds to secure a second term as president. Blatter conceded yesterday that recent scandals had exposed flaws in the system. Hacks lack luggage While the England squad arrived without a hitch in Baden-Baden yesterday, journalists following the squad did not enjoy an auspicious start to the tournament. A group of more than 50 reporters whose organisations paid \u00a318,000 a head for an all-inclusive tour following England all the way to the final arrived in Stuttgart to find their luggage had been routed to Frankfurt. Lufthansa has promised that biros and notepads will be reunited with their owners promptly. Lowy's Olympic spirit Football Federation Australia is marking the national side's second qualification for a World Cup finals by flying the surviving members of the 1974 squad and family members to Germany to watch the group match against Japan in Kaiserslautern next Monday. Chairman Frank Lowy, a construction millionaire who co-founded the Westfield Group, is personally meeting the cost of the trip. Lowy is likely to have more than a walk-on part in preparations for the 2012 Olympics too with Westfield on the brink of taking control of the Stratford City development that will incorporate part of the Olympic Village. FA on the wrong road The Football Association spared no expense in the run-up to the World Cup, including sending a Bentley to collect Steven Gerrard from his home last week to meet up with the rest of the England squad. Unfortunately the driver was sent to Gerrard's old address and the Liverpool captain was left waiting for an hour for the car to arrive. The unscheduled delay features in a documentary about Gerrard, A Year In My Life, on Sky One at 9.50pm tonight. The programme, produced by Pitch International, follows Gerrard at home and work through the last season and features his partner Alex Curran in curlers, as well as Gerrard's revelation that he played \"a captain's role\" during the delivery of his second child. \"I stayed up the head end, 'cos to be fair they work hard in delivery,\" he says. Wing and a prayer World Cup Balls II: Not to be outdone by the Catholic Church, which is basing a recruitment campaign round the World Cup, the Church of England is belatedly cashing in on interest in the tournament. Two curates from the Northern Marches will this week prepare a World Cup service, seeking to evoke the divine by reflecting on England's opening fixture against Paraguay. Anyone listening to BBC Radio Hereford and Worcester or BBC Radio Shropshire at 7am on Sunday will be able to hear it, and surely with this display of initiative full vicarships are only a matter of time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
