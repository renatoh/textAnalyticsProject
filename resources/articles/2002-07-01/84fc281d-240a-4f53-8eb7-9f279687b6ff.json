Yesterday they were thwarted, and perhaps not temporarily, by two obstacles: the weather and an obdurate partnership. The rain at least was advertised, and a gloomy blanket of drizzle puddled the ground in early morning. But coastal weather does not always obey the television pundits, and play began after lunch with 35 overs of the allocation lost. The partnership, given the hapless performance of Sussex first time around and the cocky strut of Kent, was even more surprising than the temporary relief from rain. With three wickets down in their second innings on Thursday night, Sussex were just beginning to see the seeds of a firm alliance sown by their Zimbabwean signing Murray Goodwin and the 19-year-old Tim Ambrose, Australian born of English parents and now ECB-qualified. Ambrose arrived here a couple of years ago to play league cricket for Eastbourne, and his promise was soon recognised at county level. It could have been very different. On Thursday evening Kent fielded two substitutes while Mark Ealham rested with a sore knee and Min Patel sought brief treatment for a back strain. The second understudy was their physio Martyn Sigley, a first-class cricketer himself as wicket-keeper for Central Districts in New Zealand. On 29 Goodwin edged to Sigley at point but was reprieved. When further rain closed in after 52 overs yesterday evening he and Ambrose had added 202 runs, both players reaching three figures, and the home side were 52 runs in credit with seven wickets still in hand. The recuperative effort pleased the Sussex coach Peter Moores. \"Partnerships are the key,\" he said. \"It's two against 11 while you're out there and the trick is to keep each other going. We've just got to bat and bat now, put some pressure on for a change.\" Goodwin has been struggling of late, finding various ingenious ways to get out, since making 162 against Somerset early in the season. His opening alliance with Richard Montgomerie, such a factor in Sussex's promotion to the First Division, has been spluttering recently, denying the team a platform, but yesterday as the wicket flattened out he looked at ease once more. Ambrose, who made a lovely 149 against Yorkshire in June, is confirmation that a younger generation is now coming through at Hove. But as the rain intensified yesterday evening both sides were feeling the frustration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
