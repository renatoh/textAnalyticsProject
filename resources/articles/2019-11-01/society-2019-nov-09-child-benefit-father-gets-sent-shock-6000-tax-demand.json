Most of the bill relates to money that your ex received for two children who are not even biologically yours. Yet the tax authorities aren\u2019t pursuing her for the money, or the kids\u2019 natural father \u2013 they have come after you. That\u2019s the situation for one Midlands man in a case that throws a spotlight on rules that one top accountancy body has called a potential \u201creputational disaster\u201d for HM Revenue &amp; Customs. The tax situation for claimants of child benefit is highly controversial. If you or your partner earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, the benefit is progressively clawed back through the tax system, until it\u2019s worth nothing on incomes over \u00a360,000. It means a couple where both earn \u00a345,000, giving a household income of \u00a390,000, obtain the full value of child benefit, but a couple where one earns \u00a360,000 and the other is not working effectively receive no benefit. It also means that when a couple breaks up, and HMRC discover that the child benefit paid to the mother should be clawed back, they may chase the former partner for the money \u2013 a person who may not even be the biological father, and may not have been married to the mother. When the child benefit clawback system came into force \u2013 it\u2019s called the High Income Child Benefit Charge \u2013 the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales warned about this very issue, calling the legislation seriously flawed in principle and practice. \u201cHMRC will be using the tax system to claw back from one individual a benefit paid to another \u2026 in the period between the benefit being paid and then clawed back, the couple could be separated, involved in an acrimonious divorce, or completely out of touch with each other,\u201d it said. This is pretty much the situation that Phil Adams* finds himself in. He says he was stunned to receive a letter from HMRC telling him he owes the huge sum relating to a period from 2014 to 2017. He says he is being penalised for money that he neither applied for nor received. Adams has appealed against the bill, but this has been rejected. HMRC rules are clear that the liability always falls on the higher-earning partner. And it doesn\u2019t matter if the child who is, or was, living with you is not your own. Adams says he received a letter out of the blue in May this year telling him he owed \u00a36,233 \u2013 later reduced to \u00a36,130. Most of this \u2013 just over \u00a35,000 \u2013 relates to child benefit cash paid to his then-partner during the 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 tax years. The rest is penalties. Critics will point out that Adams\u2019 ignorance of the rules is no excuse, and agree with HMRC\u2019s view that \u201cthe legislation regarding this matter is clear.\u201d But Adams says that in 2012 \u2013 which is when the government unveiled a publicity campaign about the new tax regime ahead of its 2013 launch \u2013 he was single with no children and earning a lot less than \u00a350,000, so this wouldn\u2019t have been on his radar at all. He and his now ex-partner moved in together in early 2014. It was also at around that time that his salary went over the \u00a350,000 threshold after he got a new job. Adams\u2019 then-partner already had two children from a previous relationship and had been receiving child benefit since before they met, he says. They then had a child of their own, who was born at the end of 2016. However, the couple separated earlier this year. He says he believes his then-partner submitted a claim for child benefit following the birth of their child, at which point she may well have been informed about the tax charge regime \u2013 but says that she kept him in the dark about it. He says if he had been aware of what was happening, he would have contacted the relevant department to get their child benefit payments stopped due to his high income. However, he adds that even if he had done that, his then-partner could have simply contacted the child benefit department to get the payments restarted without his knowledge. \u201cThere is no reasonable way for someone in my position to stop child benefit payments to their partner \u2026 It was not myself but my partner that has claimed this child benefit, and therefore the responsibility to return this money needs to lie with her,\u201d says Adams. He appealed the HMRC ruling, but was told last month that he had lost his case, so he decided to take the matter to an independent tribunal, which will now make a final decision. In its letter to Adams, HMRC makes clear that the obligation is on the individual to notify HMRC of their liability. \u201cIt is not HMRC\u2019s obligation to notify them of their liability,\u201d it said. The letter concluded that Adams did not have a \u201creasonable excuse or special circumstances\u201d. HMRC says the tax charge was brought in \u201cto ensure support is targeted at those who need it most\u201d. It told Guardian Money that a higher earner is liable to pay the tax charge for the period he or she is living with someone who is a child benefit recipient. \u201cThe important thing is whether the person claiming child benefit, or their partner, has income over \u00a350,000, and not whether they are the biological parent of the child.\u201d * Not his real name How the tax charge works With child benefit, you get \u00a320.70 a week, or \u00a31,076 a year, for the oldest child, and \u00a313.70 a week, or \u00a3712 a year, per additional child. But this is clawed back via the tax system if either you or your partner have an adjusted net income of more than \u00a350,000. The tax charge is 1% of the amount of child benefit for each \u00a3100 of income on a sliding scale between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000. For those earning more than \u00a360,000 the charge is 100% \u2013 in effect, they receive no child benefit. You can choose to opt out of getting child benefit payments and thereby avoid the charge, and many families have done this. Your adjustable net income is your total taxable income (that is, basic salary plus benefits you get from your job, rental income and so on), minus things such as pension contributions and gift-aided donations to charity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
