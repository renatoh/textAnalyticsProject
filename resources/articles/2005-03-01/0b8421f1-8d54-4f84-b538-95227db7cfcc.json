The two were followed by Viswanathan Anand 6.5, Peter Leko 6, Michael Adams 5.5, Rustam Kasimdzhanov and Francisco Vallejo Pons 4. Kasparov was declared the winner on tie-break (they had an equal number of wins but he won more games with Black than Topalov) but even so his 'victory' will surely feel much more like a heavy defeat. Over the past few years, Kasparov's position as the unchallenged world number one has gradually come under question. This was due most of all to his defeat at the hands of Vladimir Kramnik in London in 2000 elevating Kramnik to the rank of 'Classical World Champion'. Kasparov's aura of invincibility has also been undermined by the odd bad result, most notably just 3/6 at the European Club Cup in Cesme in Turkey last October. Disappointment, however, has always acted as a spur to Kasparov - indeed he is normally at his most dangerous immediately after losing a game and he rebounded immediately, with a splendid victory in the Russian 'Super-Championship' in November. Linares too, looked to be in the bag when, with two rounds remaining, Kasparov led by 1.5. After a quiet start with draws against Leko and Kasimdzhanov, he had started to turn up the heat with victories against Vallejo and Adams and finished the first cycle on 4/6, half-a-point ahead of Anand and Topalov. Kasparov began the second cycle in trenchant style, coming close to defeating Leko and following with three successive victories against Kasimdzhanov, Vallejo and Adams. Understandably, he made a qucik draw as White against Anand but this allowed Topalov, who defeated Vallejo, to close to just a point behind. After a very tense battle, Kasparov appeared to panic, forcing liquidation to a king and pawn ending in which Topalov had an extra doubled pawn. At first sight, this was insufficient for victory but pawn endings are very treacherous and Topalov succeeded in putting him into zugzwang. In his post-tournament press conference, Kasparov sensationally announced his 'retirement from professional chess'. More on this next week, but for the moment, here is Kasparov's fine win as Black against Adams. Michael Adams v Gary Kasparov Linares 2005 (round 12) Sicilian Najdorf 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Nc3 a6 After a fairly traumatic outing with the Sveshnikov (2...Nc6 and 5...e5) in round 6 against Anand, Kasparov returns to his favourite Najdorf. 6 Be3 e6 7 Be2 Qc7 8 Qd2 b5 9 a3 A slight weakening but necessary to prevent ...b4 9...Bb7 10 f3 Nc6 Normally Black develops his knight on d7 in similar variations but Kasparov's unusual choice prepares to open lines immediately if White goes long. 11 0-0-0!? Very brave but perhaps White should have started with 11 g4 when he can gain space on the kingside and isn't absolutely committed to placing his king in what turns out later to be great danger. 11...b4 12 axb4 Nxb4 13 g4 Be7 14 g5 Nd7 15 h4 Nc5 16 Kb1 Rb8 17 h5 0-0! Although the White pawns look threatening, it's hard to find a good way to open lines against the Black king. In contrast Black has already got a half open b file and while Kasparov's attack starts later it therefore carries a potentially heavier payload. 18 g6 In the post mortem after the game, the players analysed all sorts of interesting lines including 18 Ncb5 Qa5 19 Na3 Bxe4 20 fxe4 Nxe4 21 Qe1 Rfc8 22 Nb3 Qxa3 23 bxa3 Nxc2 24 Qa5 Rxb3+ 25 Ka2 Rxe3 26 Bxa6 (26 Bd3 is better but still good for Black) Rc5 and Black wins. 18...Bf6 19 Rdg1 Gary Kasparov (Black to play) Michael Adams (White) It was at this stage that I started spectating at the Internet Chess Club (ICC - www.chessclub.com). Kasparov now settled down for a very long think before producing an admirably calm move which requires excellent nerves and understanding in such a tense position. 19...Ba8! Kasparov afterwards called this 'A great move'. His main alternative had been 19...Qb6 which also sets up play along the b file but weakens the second rank and 'half-pins' the c5 knight. As a result, White can break through with 20 h6 hxg6 21 hxg7 Bxg7 22 Nxe6 when 22...fxe6 23 Rxg6 Kf7 24 Rxg7+ Kxg7 25 Bh6+ Kf7 26 Bxf8 is fatal. Kasparov instead looked at 22...Bxe4! 23 fxe4 Na2 24 Nb5! (24 Na4? Qxb2+! is eventually good for Black) which he decided was far enough though it turns out that after Nxe4 25 Qd3 Qxb5 26 Qxb5 fxe6! 27 Qxb8 Rxb8 28 Kxa2 Rxb2+ 29 Ka3 Rxc2 30 Bg4 Rc3+ 31 Kb4 Rxe3 Black should hold. 20 Bg5?! Blocking the g file. White has several alternatives here including the rather passive 20 Bd1, which both players vaguely considered , 20 Rg4 and 20 gxh7+ which has the advantage that unless Black commits himself to 20...Kxh7 - which must be correct here though normally you use the pawn to shield your king - then 20...Kh8 21 Bg5 is a big improvement over the game. 20...Be5 21 gxh7+ If 21 Bh6 fxg6 22 hxg6 Nbd3! (Kasparov considered 22...Qb7 which is also good) 23 cxd3 Bxd4 the Black attack should win. 21...Kxh7! If 21...Kh8? 22 h6 g6 23 f4 then the Black king's position is very unfortunate though even so both 23...Qa5 and 23...f56 are still extremely messy. 22 Nb3? Seeing no good way to continue his attack, Adams panicked and blundered. If 22 Bf4? Bxd4 23 Qxd4 e5 wins so presumably 22 Be3 was correct though the Black attack is very scary. 22...Nxc2! 23 Nxc5 Na3+ 24 Ka2 Qxc5 25 Na4 Nc2! Of course if now 26 Nxc5 Rxb2 mate. 26 Kb1 Qa3 and Adams resigned in view of 27 Qxc2 Rfc8 28 Qxc8 Rxb2+!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
