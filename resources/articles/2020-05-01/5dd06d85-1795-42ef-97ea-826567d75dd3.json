Atalanta\u2019s manager is talking about how he motivates players. He describes how he often puts up messages in the changing room and one of the most recent, he says, was from Michael Jordan: \u201cTwenty-six times, I have been trusted with the final shot and I missed. I\u2019ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And this is why I succeed.\u201d Gasperini pauses and says: \u201cBut the best one is about the wolf pack.\u201d The wolf pack? \u201cI posted a picture of a wolf pack in the changing room. There are wolves at the front, some in the middle and one at the back. The ones up front can set the pace in the beginning. The next wolves are the strongest, they are the ones who must protect everyone if they are attacked. The ones in the centre are always protected. \u201cThen there are another five strong ones further back to protect an attack from there. The last one is the boss and he ensures no one is left behind. He keeps everyone united and is always prepared to run everywhere; to protect the whole group. The message is that a leader doesn\u2019t just stay up front; he takes care of the team and this is what I want from my players.\u201d It is an unusual message to send a group of highly-paid professionals but it is working. What Gasperini wants from his players, he gets. Before coronavirus struck, Atalanta were having the best season in their 113-year-old history. They are one of four teams through to the Champions League quarter-finals \u2013 with Paris Saint-Germain, RB Leipzig and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u2013 and on course to qualify for next season\u2019s competition. Then there are the goals. They have scored the most in Italy since the start of last season. This campaign there have been 70 in 25 league games. Three times they have scored seven \u2013 against Udinese, Torino and Lecce. Two of those games were away. Milan and Parma were beaten 5-0. Atalanta are, simply put, one of the most entertaining teams in the world. How has Gasperini done it? \u201cTo give you an idea I will use a Chinese proverb from 500 BC [from the Art of War]: \u2018Defending makes you invincible, but if you want to win, you must attack.\u2019 This sums up the spirit and mentality I want my team to have. But there\u2019s something else that is important too: the identity you create in a team must always be reinforced. You must grow and improve, day by day, because if you do not improve, you are done. Those who stop, they have lost.\u201d Gasperini is relentless in his demands, not unlike J\u00fcrgen Klopp. Training is merciless and some players have not enjoyed it. Christian Vieri once said that Gasperini \u201cwill destroy you in training\u201d but Atalanta\u2019s manager says: \u201cDuring training, my players need to struggle; those who aren\u2019t used to working hard scare me. But from the struggle, victories are born. If you don\u2019t run in training then you don\u2019t run during the game. Then, of course it is important to have fun in training too because from that comes the style of play and the quality.\u201d Gasperini has created a remarkable team from an unusual set of players. The captain is the remarkable Papu G\u00f3mez, a 32-year-old Argentinian who joined from Metalist Kharkiv for \u00a34m in 2014. Another key forward, Josip Ilicic, is also 32 and arrived from Fiorentina for \u00a35m in 2017. The former Aston Villa goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini, former Middlesbrough midfielder Marten de Roon and Mario Pasalic, a Croat who belongs to Chelsea but has found a home in Bergamo on his fifth loan away from the London club since joining in 2014, are other key components. Robin Gosens arrived from Eredivisie side Heracles for less than \u00a31m, yet is one of Europe\u2019s most sought-after left-backs now while Bergamo-born Mattia Caldara is back at Atalanta after spells at Juventus and Milan and has been outstanding at centre-back. These players are in the best form of their lives, but why? \u201cThere is a secret,\u201d the 62-year-old Gasperini says. \u201cWhen you reach the maturity necessary to understand that hard work leads to results, you no longer feel tired. Let\u2019s not lose track of the fact that footballers don\u2019t train as hard as other athletes, where the training is tough and intense. My players must think of that and go at it harder. We never had the means for big investments, so we had to find young players in Europe with the same philosophy: able to adapt to our style of play, winning mentality, offensive-minded and willing to work hard. Those who believe in that is one of us, those who are afraid leave.\u201d G\u00f3mez once said Gasperini trains players so hard that a match feels like a day off. \u201cWith Papu we are talking about an extraordinary player who had not achieved his potential because he never trained well,\u201d Gasperini says. \u201cWhen he started training better he raised his level to become one of the best in Europe. He wasted time because training makes you into a champion: he always had everything to become one. \u201cIlicic is another one. We used to call him \u2018Josip the Grandma\u2019 because he was just going around being nice to everyone. We had to convince him to increase his efforts at training. He was missing that mental step but once he changed his mindset we stopped calling him grandma, now we call him \u2018The Professor\u2019. He realised that every training session is fun and from that decision he was reborn.\u201d Life has not always been straightforward for Gasperini. After a decent playing career, which started at Juventus\u2019 youth teams and included 59 Serie A appearances for Pescara, he joined Juve\u2019s coaching setup, looking after their under-14s, under-17s and the Primavera squads (under-20s). Successful spells at Genoa earned him the nickname \u201cGasperson\u201d with a nod to Sir Alex Ferguson because of the team\u2019s style. However, in 2011, when given his chance at a big club, Inter, it went horribly wrong. He lasted less than three months, having failed to win a game, sacked after a demoralising defeat by promoted Novara. As fate would have it though, his dismissal led to one of his favourite moments in football. \u201cI had just been sacked at Inter because I didn\u2019t have the same vision as the management. Then I received a beautiful message: Pep Guardiola wanted to meet me and he invited me to watch his training sessions at Barcelona. It was a very tough moment in my career and to see how an extraordinary manager like Guardiola stayed close to me at that time, it tells you the type of person he is. He made me very happy.\u201d Even at Atalanta, Gasperini initially had problems. At the start of the 2016-17 season the newly appointed manager lost four of his first five league games. There was again talk of the sack when he threw caution to the wind and gave several young players a chance against Napoli, one of the best teams at the time. Atalanta won 1-0 and have not looked back. \u201cI decided to go down this path,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll make it until the end with my ideas; I\u2019m ready to risk everything because I believe in it. We started Mattia Caldara, Roberto Gagliardini, Andrea Petagna and Andrea Conti and other young players with only a few Serie A games between them. We won with a fantastic performance that no one forgets about since that was the beginning of the growth. The beginning for the historical Atalanta way. \u201cI had the idea to play youngsters right away. In Italy, Bergamo is considered a very important place for work, industry and productivity. I wanted to have a project tied to young players, preferably raised in the Atalanta academy, which is exceptional. For too long the backbone of the team was too old so I tried to avoid relegation with a different method: to have full confidence in the young players, develop them and prioritise quality football.\u201d Tactically, Gasperini rarely deviates from 3-5-2/3-4-3, although there is a lot more positional rotation now. His high-pressing game is unusual for the Italian league. He wants players to look for space and has even told them that watching the referee can help: \u201cFinding space is fundamental for a player so I told them: \u2018Look at the referee, he\u2019s never being marked, he\u2019s always in an ideal position to see the game!\u2019 Papu, in particular, has taken on this advice and it has really helped him.\u201d His wife, Cristina, has said that he sometimes wakes in the night and grabs his computers and starts writing notes. \u201cYes,\u201d he says and laughs. \u201cWith my computer at night or with my blackboard I\u2019m always studying for solutions for the next game and only when I believe they will work will we start training.\u201d In Italy, Gasperini has always been seen as the man with the three centre-backs. It has almost defined him. He has been criticised by some for sticking by tactics associated with catenaccio. \u201cI\u2019m proud of this, because I suggested the three-man defence many years ago when I was coaching in Juventus\u2019 youth system. Back then I was told it was too defensive. I proved it was the opposite: the three defenders participate in the run of play, they are trained to be involved offensively. \u201cThe formation doesn\u2019t matter, but rather with how many players do you attack or defend. If I had to sum up my defensive philosophy in one phrase it would be that I don\u2019t believe and I will never believe in the concept of waiting for your opponent to make a mistake: I think you must try to steal the ball to attack.\u201d Atalanta finished fourth in 2016-17, seventh the following campaign and third last season to qualify for the Champions League group stage. They started by losing 4-0 at Dinamo Zagreb, 2-1 at home to Shakhtar Donetsk and 5-1 at Manchester City but reached the last 16 by drawing against City and winning their two remaining games. \u201cI always tell my players: we never lose, we either win or learn,\u201d Gasperini says. Guardiola has said playing against Gasperini\u2019s Atalanta is like \u201cgoing to the dentist\u201d. The Italian approves: \u201cThat is my objective: create a team that would make any opponent struggle. Those who play against us must run a lot and be bothered. I think the dentist metaphor, it is perfect.\u201d Valencia were vanquished 8-4 on aggregate in the Champions League last 16. And then everything stopped. Gasperini remembers returning to Bergamo from the second leg in Spain. \u201cIt felt like we were in a country torn apart by war. Everything happened so quickly: just a few days before there was no feeling of what could happen. I remember when we arrived in Valencia, we found a city filled with people celebrating in the streets or outside the stadium, while in Bergamo there were the first indications the situation was critical. When we came back to Bergamo we realised how much had changed in just two days. We went from euphoria to fear in the span of 48 hours.\u201d Gasperini is struggling to find the words to describe the past two months in Bergamo. \u201cThis has been something extraordinary, unexplainable with words. Bergamo has been at the centre of this awful coronavirus. It hit our city deeply and caused so many deaths \u2026 I\u2019ll never forget the sirens we heard in the centre of Bergamo for the rest of my life.\u201d When matches resume Gasperini knows what he will tell his team. \u201cI will put the emotional aspect right, front and centre. These players have a great bond with Bergamo: the city and the fans. I will talk emotionally and my sentiment will be this: Bergamo suffered a lot, this is our moment to make them smile again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
