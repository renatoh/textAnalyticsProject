From body temperature to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Claudia reveals how our calculation of time can be affected by a range of physical and mental conditions. Alok Jha is joined by two fans of science geekdom, Mark Henderson author of The Geek Manifesto: Why Science Matters, and Angela Saini, author of Geek Nation: How Indian Science is Taking Over the World. Angela and Mark discuss why science geeks are valued in India but not in the UK and the possibility of a \"geek vote\" to lobby for change. They will host a debate entitled \"In defence of geeks\" on 19 May at the Bristol Festival of Ideas. Angela and Mark also review some of this week's science news including the Royal Society of Chemistry's first woman president Professor Lesley Yellowlees and her comments that the UK is half a century behind the US in terms of opportunities for women scientists, and the latest in the debate about open access to scientific research.
