Sales tumbled by more than 11% in the first half of its financial year as Julian Dunkerton retook the helm and overhauled the retailer, which was running frequent promotions to increase sales. \u201cWe are moving the business away from a reliance on constant promotions, and while this focus on full price sales has affected revenue in the first half, this is being partially offset by a better gross margin performance,\u201d he said. The shares, which plunged from more than \u00a320 to about \u00a34 in 2018, prompting Dunkerton\u2019s effort to get back into the boardroom, gained 6% to \u00a34.50 on the back of the update. Dunkerton, who was reinstalled as chief executive in April after a bitter boardroom battle that resulted in other directors walking out, said 70% of clothing was sold at full price in the six months to 26 October, up from 52% a year ago. But the impact on the company\u2019s top line was stark, with sales down \u00a347m at \u00a3368m as it came up against figures from a year ago that had been bolstered by heavy discounting. The retailer said it was \u201ccautious about the challenging market conditions over the peak trading period\u201d. Dunkerton, who started out selling clothes on a Cheltenham market stall, launched Superdry with the designer James Holder in 2003. He has said it will take several years to turn the business around after the company lost its way under the previous management team led by Euan Sutherland. \u201cWe have taken swift and decisive action \u2026 as part of the business reset, which is a two- to three-year programme to gain full control of the product and costs,\u201d said Dunkerton, who is the company\u2019s biggest shareholder with a near 20% stake. A key tenet of Dunkerton\u2019s plan is to take the company back to its design-led roots and the GlobalData analyst James Yacoub said Superdry needed to work on its style credentials. Yacoub said the appointment of the former Nike executive Phil Dickinson as creative director could \u201chelp restore Superdry\u2019s long lost \u2018cool factor\u2019\u201d. But, he added, \u201cthis will be no easy task\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
