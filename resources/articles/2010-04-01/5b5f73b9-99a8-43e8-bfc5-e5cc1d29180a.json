Speaking in Jaipur before today's match between Bangalore Royal Challengers and the Rajasthan Royals, Pietersen said he was \"very disappointed\" England's leading bowlers \u2013 notably Stuart Broad and James Anderson \u2013 had opted out of the current IPL season. \"I was speaking to Colly [Paul Collingwood] last week and we really would have liked a couple of our bowlers to be out here bowling and learning about this form of the game,\" he said. England have an entire potential World Twenty20 top order at the IPL \u2013 in Michael Lumb, Ravi Bopara, Pietersen, Collingwood and Eoin Morgan \u2013 but not a single bowler. Broad and Anderson announced their unavailability in December, citing the impending physical demands of next winter's Ashes series. Pietersen, however, believes the IPL should be a priority. \"The difficulty in England when the IPL came about was that it was all a question of money, money, money. But it has become a 'World Cup' tournament,\" he said. \"We've missed the boat. Our players should definitely have put their names in the hat and tried to find a way to get into this set-up. You can only get better by playing against these players.\" He would also like the England and Wales Cricket Board to open up a window for England players to take part in a full IPL season. \"Certainly for the English team to improve in this format of the game we're going to have to play it a lot,\" he said. \"For us to be available for the full six weeks would be really good.\" Available he may be but the most recent stages in Pietersen's further education in top-level Twenty20 have come from the bench. \"I was surprised, and it is frustrating to be watching when you want to be playing,\" he said of his omission from Bangalore's last two matches. \"We have some brilliant batsmen right the way through the order, and you can only have four internationals. But getting man of the match and then the next game missing out is pretty frustrating.\" One man who will definitely play today is Lumb. Pietersen is not surprised by his Hampshire team-mate's success at the top of the Royals order. \"I've always known Lumby was a very good player,\" he said. \"He's really good in this form of the game, really good in making sure you get a good start, and he thoroughly deserves his place in the England team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
