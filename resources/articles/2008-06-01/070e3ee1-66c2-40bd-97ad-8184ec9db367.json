Berthold Lubetkin did his research into animal behaviour too, and was not overruled on the rubber flooring designed to stimulate the penguins' feet, although this was later removed. There is a long tradition of well-known architects designing zoo enclosures which are heralded at the time, but later fall into disuse. The remarkable thing about the penguin pool is it that it housed penguins for 70 years before the zoo decided that it no longer met animal welfare standards; the building itself remains popular. The zoo's subsequent difficulties in finding a use for it, housing alligators, then porcupines, illustrate that zoos are not just places to see animals but also an often intractable but important architectural legacy. London Zoo's challenge, like Copenhagen's, whose Greek temple for elephants is now presumably empty, is to reconcile conserving animals and conserving its heritage. Whether the Foster and Partners exhibit still houses elephants in 70 years' time, or continues to be of architectural interest, remains to be seen. Andrew Shapland London Jonathan Glancey waxes lyrical about the architectural wonder that is the new elephant house at Copenhagen Zoo, and up to a point he is right. Compared with most other zoos it probably is \"pure elephant bliss\". What he doesn't say is how much room elephants need and indeed do have in the wild - where they walk up to 20 miles a day. Fat chance of that in any zoo. Sue Berry Preston, Lancashire"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
