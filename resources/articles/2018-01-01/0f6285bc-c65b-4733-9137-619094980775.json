The suspect, who has not been named by police, was arrested on Monday following the death of Vijay Patel, 49. He was critically injured with a single blow on Saturday night after refusing to sell cigarette papers to three teenage boys at a convenience store in Mill Hill, north London, because of their age. The boy is due to appear at Willesden magistrates court on Wednesday. The boys went to the shop on The Broadway in Mill Hill late on Saturday to buy several items, including the cigarette papers. The shop\u2019s owner suffered minor injuries when he was punched by the teenagers, who fled from the scene. Members of the public tried to help Patel, giving him first aid before the arrival of police and paramedics. When police arrived just before midnight, they found him lying on the pavement outside the shop. Police said they were continuing to appeal for information from potential witnesses. Anyone with information should call 020 8358 0200, or ring Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
