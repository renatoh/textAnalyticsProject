Trotters, on Bethnal Green Road in east London, is a small independent jewellery shop that likes to think big. The business was founded by Judd Green\u2019s father in 1991, and passed down to his son, who now runs the shop with his best friends from school, Kallum and Alex. This rapid-fire hour, narrated by Dani Dyer, is an attempt to showcase the trio\u2019s cheeky chappy charm as much as it is about the art of selling spectacularly expensive watches and chains. Trotters has a big following on Instagram, and a customer base all over the UK, with people making the trip to Bethnal Green from as far afield as Bradford, much to the amusement of Dyer\u2019s voiceover. Their patrons haggle and often pay in cash, and the shop is certainly a lively kind of place. While recent documentaries about pet food and chocolate factories seemed little more than glorified ads, this at least tries to get to the heart of what makes Trotters tick. Judd, Kallum and Alex are keen to make the point that the people shopping with them are people like them. \u201cWe get a lot more working-class than we do posh people,\u201d explains Judd. We see a lot of the customers who come through, each showing off their own form of British eccentricity. There\u2019s Grizz, referred to euphemistically as a \u201clocal amateur horticulturalist\u201d, who wants his sparkly union jack pendant to be \u201ciced up\u201d before he takes a trip to California to explore the cannabis industry there. There\u2019s a lot of double-speak here, and though I was desperate to know more about the people who appeared, it never scratched much more than the surface. Ashley and Ashley, a couple from Essex, popped in so male Ashley could buy female Ashley a diamond crucifix. \u201cWe had a little breakup a few weeks ago,\u201d explains male Ashley. \u201cHad to butter her up a little bit.\u201d When female Ashley reappears a few weeks later, all that butter has melted away (demonstrating the true cost of a relationship when she cannot get the full cost of the make-up necklace refunded). The best customer is Charlotte, who comes to look at angel-wing pendants. Now, perhaps the arrival of a very eccentric customer when cameras were in the shop was a coincidence; let\u2019s not be cynical. Charlotte turns out to be a psychic and clairvoyant who can read the tarot. Naturally, she offers to show off her skills, and by reading Alex\u2019s palms she deduces that he is a bit anaemic, and has irritable bowel syndrome. Even if they did bus her in for a bit of drama, it was delightful, and possibly the most English of psychic consultations that has ever taken place: \u201cTell me what the future holds.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have a dicky tummy if you keep eating pastry.\u201d As a film, though, this can\u2019t contain the big characters within it, and never sufficiently trusts that the \u201cnowt so queer as folk\u201d approach will sustain it, even though it would. Instead, it falls back on contrivances (if it is one) like the psychic. They also pop up to Sheffield to meet the boxer Charlie Edwards, who has just FaceTimed them, to chat about a special commission, and do little to improve north-south relations when they say it\u2019s \u201clike going back in time\u201d and \u201cproper Billy Elliot\u201d as they drive into the city. There\u2019s a semi-tortured explanation given for a quick trip to New York that seems to take place just so Dyer gets to say: \u201cFrom the East End to the east coast.\u201d They\u2019re there, I think, to look at the kind of watch worn by DJ Khaled in an Instagram video, called \u201cthe chandelier\u201d, a blinding piece of bling, literally; it\u2019s so shiny it should come with a warning to never look directly at it. They go for dinner in an empty restaurant with the rapper Casanova 2X, who thinks the watch is over the top, so they don\u2019t bring one home with them. End of the New York segment. That\u2019s it. We get the setup, but nothing delivers. It leaves you with the post-junk food feeling, like you\u2019ve eaten, and you\u2019re sort of full, but you\u2019re also nowhere near satisfied. Actually, the boys do decide to get a chandelier made in the end, but they order it from Hong Kong, and the rest of the episode is concerned with whether they can shift a watch for \u00a3120,000 or not. Spoiler alert: everyone thinks a watch that costs more than four times the average annual UK salary is a bit too showy. Like the wares Trotter is peddling, this documentary is flashy and never understated, but unlike the contents of the shop, it has little to offer in the way of value."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
