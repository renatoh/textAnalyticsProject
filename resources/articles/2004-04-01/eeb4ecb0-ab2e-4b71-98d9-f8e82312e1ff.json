If you hadn't been there and done it, you couldn't go there and do it. The big names added trophies to their collections, the others faltered. And when the biggest name stumbled, there was a successor ready and waiting to take his place. Recently, though, the exception has become the rule, with the past five major winners (Shaun Micheel, Ben Curtis, Jim Furyk, Mike Weir, Rich Beem) all being first-timers. Golf is verging on becoming democratic. There is something amiss with Tiger Woods. His displeasure with himself, his game and everything never more evident than at the 11th, when he missed a makeable par putt and nearly broke his putter in frustration. He has won every one of his majors from the front, yet at no stage has he looked likely to be going into the final round in the lead. Yet no one has taken advantage of his lapses to establish himself. And at halfway, despite the presence of a relaxed Ernie Els and the extraordinary Jose Maria Olazabal, there was every chance the trend might continue. Leading the way for the first-timers was Justin Rose, who might have been even further ahead had he made some putts. As it was, he took 32 putts on Thursday and 32 on Friday (11 more than Davis Love III's combined total) and still led by two shots. He refused to dwell on his missed opportunities saying: 'Actually some of the putts I hit really well; they didn't go in. That's often all you can do. It would have been nice to take advantage of a couple of good shots into the greens. But at the same time, you know, in the back of your mind, you always know that par is a good score. So when you don't make the putt, you still feel like, well, you're not putting a lot of pressure on yourself and it just keeps things moving along smoothly.' Nearest to him was Alex Cejka, who shot consecutive 70s, hitting three out of four fairways, to be at four under par. Cejka was born in Czechoslovakia and remained there until he was nine. Then he went for a swim with his father while holidaying in Yugoslavia: 'I really didn't know where we were going, what was happening, and suddenly, he hugged me and said, \"We did it,\" and we were in Germany.' Either his memory or his geography is weak. Asked by American journalists, still lusting after a decent Cold War story, if there were risks involved in this escapade, he replied: 'I think they would shoot us if they catch us, but I don't know. It was communism. Nobody was allowed to get out.' As opposed to countries in the capitalist West, where it is increasingly hard to get in. And the difference between living in a country where no one can get out and living in one where no one can get in may not be as large as many imagine. Two shots behind Cejka was local boy Charles Howell III, who after successive one under par rounds was looking to emulate Larry Mize by winning on his hometown course. 'The key is not to look for answers because if you do it will have you questioning everything from your wife to your caddie to your golf clubs to which side of the bed you are sleeping on,' he explained on Good Friday. Thinner even than Rose - it has been a great tournament so far for the slims - Howell III has moved back into his parents' house and is sleeping in his childhood room. A regressive step which, given how superstitious golfers are, might lead to some interesting developments were he to win. You can just see a 50-year-old Phil Mickelson forsaking his four mansions to move back in with his folks. 'Mom, Pop, hot damn, what have you gone and done with my Charlie's Angels poster?' Maybe he won't have to because The Best Player Never To Win A Major and the Second (or is it Third?) Best Lefty in the Game is once again in contention. And once again talking about himself. Q: Phil, some of the guys were playing very good golf. A: I'm in good position heading into the weekend and looking forward to tomorrow's round. The problem with Phil Mickelson is that he could be in good position approaching the 18th on Sunday needing a par to win and you'd still back him to bottle it. Level with Woods is Sergio Garcia, who has shot two par rounds, about the second of which he said: 'I deserve more than I got today. It should have been three or four under going into the last hole. I feel OK. I'm just focusing on trying to play well. I'm not worried about winning or anything like that.' In the long term, however, the most significant first-timer may be one who didn't even make the cut. This week Lian-Wei Zhang became the first Chinese golfer to play the Masters and was only a Justin Rose bogey away from making the weekend. 'Obviously I think I could have played a lot better, but for the first Masters I'm very pleased.' His invitation came from Augusta chairman Hootie Johnson, who said: 'We felt that it was good for the game of golf to extend a hand to the most populous nation in the world.' Absolutely, Hootie, and now all you have to do is extend a hand to the more populous gender in the world. You've read the piece, now have your say.
