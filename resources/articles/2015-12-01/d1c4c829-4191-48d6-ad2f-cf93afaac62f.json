Wambach, who will play for the US women\u2019s soccer team against China in the New Orleans Superdome tonight, has received messages of support all day as she prepares to bow out, but the president\u2019s missive probably tops the lot. He tweeted: (GOAT, incidentally, is short for \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d.) Wambach, 35, has scored 184 international goals since her debut in 2001 \u2013 more than any other player, male or female, in history. In his tweet, Obama included a picture of Wambach and him in October, when the president hosted the women\u2019s soccer team to honor their victory in the Women\u2019s World Cup. Carli Lloyd scored a hat-trick as the US defeated Japan 5-2 in July to collect the trophy for the first time in 16 years. \u201cThey\u2019ve inspired millions of girls to dream bigger and, by the way, inspired millions of boys to look at girls differently, which is just as important,\u201d Obama said at the time. \u201cThis team taught all America\u2019s children that playing like a girl means you\u2019re a badass,\u201d the president said, to applause in the White House East Room. \u201cPerhaps I shouldn\u2019t have used that phrase. Playing like a girl means being the best.\u201d USA take on China at 8pm in New Orleans. We can reasonably assume that tears will be shed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
