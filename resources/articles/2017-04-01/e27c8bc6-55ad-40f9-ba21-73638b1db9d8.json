In the midst of dangerous chaos unleashed during a concert, security man Frank Farmer \u2013 the strong, silent type fond of weighty stares \u2013 rescues pop star Rachel Marron. Sweeping her in his arms, he carries her to safety \u2013 and into his heart. It was a classic scene in the 1992 blockbuster movie starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner. Not so in this remake for the stage, conceived in London\u2019s West End and now playing in Sydney with an Australian cast. Frank\u2019s rescue is more effete than Herculean and the danger facing Rachel is so flaccid I missed it entirely. No amount of strobe lighting can save what must be this musical\u2019s Big Moment. In fact, no strobe lighting, live flames, streamers, or confetti (all used amply in a glitzy but hollow production) can save The Bodyguard, full stop. Screenwriter Alexander Dinelaris, known for Birdman, has strung together an already shallow and shaky love story with a heightened thriller plot that has all the scares of a wet sock. We know the story: stalker threatens star, star hires bodyguard, bodyguard rescues star, star falls for bodyguard. Beyond this, the rest is simply confusing. I\u2019m not quite sure why Rachel invites her envious sister Nicki (Prinnie Stevens) to gawp at Frank, postcoital and naked in her bed, or why he doesn\u2019t wake up with two squabbling women talking over him. Nor why a hard-hitting bodyguard facing a trained killer would whisk Rachel away to his family home \u2013 surely the first place any respectable stalker would think to look? When the stalker finally bursts in with a giant butcher\u2019s knife, a woman near me snorted out loud. The Bodyguard\u2019s saving grace is the Fijian-born singer-songwriter Paulini Curuenavuli, of Australian Idol fame, who plays Rachel. It\u2019s true that Paulini, as she\u2019s known, can\u2019t act. And her American accent, like the rest of the cast, is appalling. And she seems to have trouble remembering her lines. But she has one hell of a voice. The same can\u2019t be said of soap star Kip Gamblin, who only has one real task: to sweep the audience off its feet. He fails. Faced with what is admittedly a razor-thin script, Gamblin compensates with leaden pauses and self-conscious pouting. Combined with a wooden delivery of lines, it\u2019s no wonder that the lovers have zero chemistry. A kiss between Frank and Rachel, broadcast in epic scale onto a giant screen, is just, well, slurpy. The Bodyguard film spawned one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time and the 16 of Whitney Houston\u2019s hits on offer here will fill seats alone. For those who aren\u2019t diehard fans, though, do yourself a favour: skip this spineless musical, a cynical exercise in moneymaking, and buy the DVD instead. \u2022 The Bodyguard is playing at the Sydney Lyric theatre from 21 April, Brisbane Lyric theatre from 19 July and Melbourne\u2019s Regent theatre from 24 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
