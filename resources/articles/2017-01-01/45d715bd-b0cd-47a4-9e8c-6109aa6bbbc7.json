But the happiest day of her life came later \u2013 when she moved out of his apartment. Brennan, a Sydney makeup artist, appeared in the second season of Australia\u2019s Married at First Sight. Last week she published a tell-all blog post about the experience that, she warned, threatened to \u201cruin reality TV for you forever\u201d. To get the right shots, she had walked down the aisle four times, said her vows three times, and kissed at the altar twice. Forced conversations concluded as soon as the cameras turned off. Dinners presented as planned by her \u201cTV husband\u201d had been set up by producers. Brennan was not even legally married: unlike other versions of Married at First Sight broadcast around the world, the Australian couples\u2019 \u201cweddings\u201d are commitment ceremonies, owing to legal restrictions. After a honeymoon and a month\u2019s cohabitation, Brennan chose not to continue with the relationship, and moved out of his apartment. \u201cOne of the happiest days of my life to date,\u201d she said. The lesson, she said, was to leave any relationship that made you question your self-worth. But, as many reports of her \u201creveal\u201d remarked, another might be not to start a relationship on a reality television show. Even \u2013 perhaps especially \u2013 the most ardent fans of reality television know it\u2019s not, you know, real. Part of the discrepancy is structural. No one can be completely themselves in front of a TV crew, and hours of footage can never be done justice to in 22- or 46-minute episodes. But another part is strategic: real life doesn\u2019t necessarily make for good TV without a little help. Only the daft need apply A reality show begins with the casting, landing on the right mix of heroes and villains for on-screen chemistry. A reality television producer who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said she looked for a range of strong characters \u2013 larger-than-life personalities, salt-of-the-earth types, show ponies, good blokes the audience would get behind \u2013 who were \u201creally open emotionally\u201d and invested in the show\u2019s premise. While shows such as Married at First Sight had inherent drama, casting was of particular importance on cooking or renovation shows \u201cbecause the premise is so boring\u201d. But even the biggest characters need a little help: \u201cYou are playing with people\u2019s emotions quite a lot \u2013 that\u2019s sort of the name of the game.\u201d People who apply to appear on reality television do so for a reason, she said; once it\u2019s clear what that reason is, it\u2019s easy to manipulate them. Sarah (not her real name) auditioned twice before she was accepted as a contestant on a reality show some years ago. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was broken down and a shell of myself that they went: \u2018Excellent, you\u2019re ready\u2019,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cMy agenda was desperation.\u201d Other agendas included vanity, fame, financial gain, the motivation of a physical challenge, a break from the monotony or mediocrity of life, she said. \u201cFor a lot of people, being in a reality television show is the most interesting thing they will ever do, and they will cling to that for the rest of their life.\u201d An absence of self-preservation instincts \u2013 an element of vulnerability \u2013 is par for the course. \u201c[You\u2019re] a little bit daft to apply, and a little bit daft to go through with it,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cYou don\u2019t agree to be half naked on television and low-level humiliated without there being a level of desperation. There is a certain level of dignity that is surrendered to be part of that process. \u201cI know there was with me, anyway.\u201d \u2018This is what you signed up for\u2019 In all sorts of shows, said the anonymous producer, contestants have to be kept from quitting as they realise they\u2019re in over their heads. Married at First Sight UK was repeatedly pushed back as participants got cold feet and withdrew. That\u2019s part of the production process, as is setting the stage for compelling television. Sarah said the most successful producers have to be \u201cmaster manipulators\u201d, prepared to set aside any concern for the participants for the sake of the show. \u201cYour commitment to the story has to be greater than your commitment to the characters.\u201d Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, the creator of the acclaimed Lifetime series UnREAL, drew from her experiences as a producer of The Bachelor for her show-about-a-reality-show. She told the New Yorker last year that her job was to get the contestants to \u201copen up, and to give them terrible advice, and to deprive them of sleep\u201d. She lied to the women about their chances, groomed them to think of particular songs as \u201ctheir song\u201d with the bachelor, and carried jalape\u00f1os or lemons to make herself cry and hopefully start a chain reaction. Nick Baylart, now of Melbourne, said food and sleep were routinely withheld to ensure \u201cinteresting performances\u201d for the sixth season of The Mole, broadcast in late 2013 after a seven-year absence from Australian screens. He was selected as one of 12 contestants after a three-month application process. Production took a further three months. Outside the sometimes demanding challenges posed within the show, the real tests were boredom, the repetitiveness of shooting, sleep deprivation and poor eating habits \u2013 par for the course for film and television production, but especially gruelling for those new to the industry. \u201cThe number of times the producer shouted at us, \u2018This is what you signed up for,\u2019 whenever we were whinging \u2013 and we did whinge.\u201d Plus, Baylart said, the producers weren\u2019t at pains to put the contestants at ease when frayed nerves made for better television. \u201cIf they can twist a necessary element of production into something that will make the contestants a little bit more ready to fight, they\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said. For one challenge, shot at an amusement park in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St Kilda, contestants were made to wait in the car park for over five hours. \u201cWe had food, and we had a port-a-john, but we had nothing to do but wait.\u201d Another task, on the Gold Coast, took place three blocks from the group\u2019s hotel. The drive there took nearly an hour, going round and round in circles, so that the contestants were fed up with each other on arrival. GoPros were filming within the car but none of that footage was ever used. \u201cYou know what they\u2019re doing, but you can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Baylart. \u201cIt\u2019s human nature.\u201d There have to be elements of reality for the show to work, said the anonymous producer (who had no connection to The Mole). \u201cYou don\u2019t script everything, because they\u2019re not actors. If you were getting people to lie all the time, you\u2019d be getting a really shitty melodrama. \u201cYou can tell when people are having a moment or when they\u2019re falling in love. People aren\u2019t that good at acting.\u201d Baylart described it as \u201cmassaging\u201d reality. The Mole\u2019s producers were never so blatant as to antagonise individual contestants, but those who were known to particularly dislike each other would find themselves repeatedly paired up. Those tensions had been established at the casting stage. Baylart said there were a lot of fights on and off camera. \u201cOn TV it seemed like we were being spiteful for the hell of it \u2026 but we really didn\u2019t like being in each other\u2019s company,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to come back to film the finale and we were all lovey-dovey then \u2013 but after that, there were a lot of Facebook blockings.\u201d He made it to the final six before he was eliminated. He was surprised and sad \u2013 but \u201cit was exciting to go home, because it meant it was over\u201d. He was also 8kg heavier, after having availed himself of the food truck while waiting around in between challenges. Another contestant put on 10kg. What goes on in the house ... does not stay in the house Baylart was struck by how much of what they\u2019d shot had gone unused (\u201cwhole plot lines\u201d) \u2013 and how little he\u2019d known about what was going on with the other contestants as it was unfolding. Every contestant had recorded a \u201cconfessional\u201d piece to camera of between 90 to 120 minutes with the producers in \u201cthe diary room\u201d each night. \u201cYou got a sense of them hunting out for commentary about particular interpersonal relationships but you might not necessarily know anything about them,\u201d said Baylart. \u201cThere\u2019s this weird sense of isolation.\u201d Tom (not his real name) called it the \u201cfishbowl effect\u201d, where, cut off from the outside world, \u201ceverything starts to circulate\u201d. He appeared in the Australian production of a popular international franchise in 2012. He and the other contestants spent a week in a hotel in Sydney in \u201clockdown\u201d before production started, in the care of \u201chandlers\u201d. The men had been asked to grow beards beforehand; some were told to shave, others weren\u2019t. Tom was styled with a \u201ccreepy moustache\u201d. It didn\u2019t end there. The show\u2019s producers had specific roles or looks in mind for each of the contestants. Tom was designated an outfit which, he said, he would never choose to wear. One contestant was asked to wear glasses that were not fitted with his prescription. Another, with whom Tom remains friends, played the guitar: \u201cThey gave him a ukulele and said, \u2018You play the ukulele now.\u2019 He\u2019d never played a ukulele in his life.\u201d One episode of this series was watched by more than 1 million Australians. If contestants\u2019 on-screen personas were at all informed by their real personalities, it was only loosely, or by coincidence. One producer had worked on Big Brother and told Tom that an audience favourite of one season had been \u201cthe biggest asshole in real life\u201d. \u201cOn our show, there was one guy who was a massive prick, but he came across really endearing.\u201d A \u201cweek\u201d in the show was three days. Gaffes were put forward as representative of particularly the female contestants\u2019 intelligence, or lack thereof. \u201cOthers just play it up for the cameras because they want a role on Home and Away.\u201d Tom said he \u201cgenerally didn\u2019t play ball\u201d with the producers, who\u2019d shoulder-tap contestants for particular scenarios or tasks. (Possibly relatedly, he was eliminated in the fourth episode.) They\u2019d call it \u201cactuality\u201d, as in, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go and shoot an actuality scene.\u201d Why not reality? Tom laughed. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not reality.\u201d \u2022 Some names and identifying details have been changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
