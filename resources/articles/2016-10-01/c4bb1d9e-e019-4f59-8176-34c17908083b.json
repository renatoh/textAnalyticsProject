It contains stories about everyday state issues, but it also runs quirky items the paper thinks sets Victoria apart as somewhat of an oddity. In many ways, Victoria is an oddity. Daniel Andrews\u2019 government is unashamedly leftwing at a time when Australians are more familiar with Labor governments run by the party\u2019s right. We are used to a virtual Labor unity ticket with conservative governments about what economic responsibility means. And we have come to expect Labor to take modest steps on social issues that don\u2019t push the boundaries too far \u2013 it would have been courageous for Labor to support same-sex marriage a decade ago; it is not now. The Andrews government is in trouble over its poor handling of the never-ending Country Fire Authority dispute, and there are constant challenges over infrastructure priorities and growing worries about crime. But on social issues, its progress has been spectacular, and so far it appears not in the least wobbly in the face of a predictable backlash. Interest groups that have lobbied for years on gender and LGBTI issues in particular are finding a receptive government determined to make big leaps, to change the culture in fundamental ways. Will it succeed? Perhaps to an extent, but you can\u2019t accuse it of not trying. Is the government ahead of public opinion? Most certainly in some areas, particularly for people living outside the inner city for whom heteronormativity is not discussed routinely around the dinner table. No doubt there will be missteps and over-reaches \u2013 and too much trendy jargon \u2013 but you can\u2019t accuse it of complacency. The government\u2019s latest initiative is the Resilience, Rights and Respectful Relationships program that will be mandatory for all school levels in government and Catholic schools from next year. Independent schools can use it if they wish. That the government scrapped religious instruction in state schools in favour of a respectful relationship curriculum took some chutzpah. The program was recommended by Victoria\u2019s royal commission into family violence, which itself was a bold inquiry, followed up by considerable government funding. Respectful relationship classes in schools are having a moment. At the Coag family violence summit on Friday, the premiers of New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania all spoke about programs under way or being implemented. Yet they come nowhere close to Victoria\u2019s almost $22m commitment over two years. In Victoria, the program is mandatory, comprehensive and firmly feminist in approach. The government says Respectful Relationships \u201cis about tackling family violence\u201d \u2013 it is stated as its primary purpose. That is a shame because, while there is lots of evidence that attitudes towards women are linked to intimate-partner violence, there is lots of evidence, too, indicating that other factors are also crucial, especially in advanced countries such as Australia. And perhaps it might have been useful to focus on preventing violence generally instead of violence against women. But those debates can be had again and again, and don\u2019t diminish the program\u2019s strengths. The family violence prevention group, Our Watch, is an advocate for respectful relationship programs in schools as one way to reduce domestic violence and it has found its champion in the Victorian government. Our Watch has acknowledged that this approach is an experiment. Few countries have taken such a generational approach, to put together a program to transform cultural attitudes towards women specifically to reduce violence against women. Is it worth a go? Of course. We can\u2019t just keep responding to family violence with more laws, police powers and refuges, as important as they are. We need a big shift, a cultural breakthrough, to stop men beating up their wives and partners \u2013 and killing them in alarming numbers (and of course that applies to men being assaulted by their partners or ex-partners). And not only do we want them to stop happening; we want them to become culturally unthinkable. There is evidence that well-designed school programs can reduce relationship violence for young people, who are more likely to be victims of violence than older people. There is worrying research, too, suggesting that many young people are holding on to antiquated ideas. One 2014 study found that a quarter of young people still believe that women who often say no to sex really mean yes. Victim blaming \u2013 maybe the woman provoked the violence \u2013 is still too common, and somehow, these views have to change. The release of the curriculum has led to some headlines in Victoria, of course, as superficial as they are predictable. The Herald Sun\u2019s resident warrior against social justice warriors, Rita Panahi, wrote that it was the \u201ctype of ideologically driven sloppy thinking that belongs in a socialist alliance get-together, not in schools\u201d. You can pluck out a line or two that might make it look so. But look deeper. It\u2019s much more than a program to reduce violence against women, as vital as that is. It just might help our kids \u2013 boys and girls \u2013 to learn critical life skills. To be more resilient in the face of setbacks, protect themselves and others from harm, cope with challenges of modern life and respect each other\u2019s differences. Children in early primary school will talk about their emotions, learn relaxation techniques to cope with stress, about how to talk to themselves positively when they get angry or frustrated. They will start to learn about problem solving and when to ask for help if they need it. And they begin to think about gender stereotypes that are already embedded by the time they reach school. This is as relevant for boys as it is for girls. The materials for older students point out that young men experience violence at higher rates than young women, and that boys are especially vulnerable to being teased or bullied if they are not typically \u201cmale\u201d, especially if they are gay or transgender. For the little kids, it\u2019s about what\u2019s your favourite ice cream, what\u2019s your favourite playground game, or your favourite quiet time activity. Can boys and girls like different things? The same thing? It even throws in the old chestnut \u2013 is it OK for a boy to like pink and a girl to like blue? Why? In older year levels, the program introduces more complex ideas. By year 11 and 12, it\u2019s full on. How to cope with the stresses of study and exams, how to set goals, positive psychology, relaxation techniques, how to handle conflict in relationships, alcohol abuse, looking out for his each other\u2019s safety at parties, and what the law says on sexual consent and sexting. None of this should be controversial. It can\u2019t be a bad thing for young adults to think about how invisible LGBTI people can feel if our language, culture and discussions assume that the only \u201cnormal\u201d thing is to be heterosexual. Or to think about why the word \u201cgirl\u201d is often used as an insult, or why women are under-represented in our parliaments and earn on average 17% less for doing the same work. And most importantly, how these things might be challenged. We have been talking about these things for so long, and while much has changed for women \u2013 and men \u2013 much has not. Gender stereotypes and expectations, reinforced by the media and advertising, are often limiting even though we have had discrimination laws in place for a generation. We are living through a time of big social change, an impatient push by women, the LGBTI community and minority cultures for significant breakthroughs. It will take determined effort but despite pockets of resistance and the messiness of it all, many citizens are ready for it. It will be fascinating to see if this program shifts attitudes and reduces violence. We will only be able to tell if it persists for many years beyond the next election, and that is not assured \u2013 the Liberal opposition is muttering about \u201cbrainwash(ing) our children with propaganda\u201d. Yet the government steams on, at least so far. Its relationship program is just one item on its social agenda. Earlier this year, Andrews scoffed at the national fuss over the Safe Schools program that aims to ensure a safe environment for LGBTI students and, again, get students thinking about stereotypes and discrimination. It is going ahead with Safe Schools without the changes the federal government insisted on, with Andrews saying he would get his policy advice from experts \u201cnot bigots\u201d. Victoria is also proposing to allow transgender people to change their birth certificates without having to undergo reassignment surgery, an idea proving challenging, especially to some feminists. Before the end of the year, it will launch another first: a statewide gender equality strategy. This has been in preparation for months, with women\u2019s minister Fiona Richardson travelling around the state consulting more than 1,000 Victorians, including businesses, councils, community groups, indigenous organisations, the media, about how to address gender inequality. The strategy will be launched as part of Victoria\u2019s 16 Days of Activism against family violence, a United Nations initiative. No other state has taken this up with such gusto. Mostly it\u2019s symbolic \u2013 last year, the parliament and other public buildings were lit up orange for 16 days as a public stand against violence against women. Wherever Victorians look, they cannot miss what\u2019s going on. It can be critiqued, of course. There are lines here and there in the various strategies that are so right-on they can make you cringe. You can argue that a focus on identity politics takes effort away from persistent economic disadvantage in some communities. And you can insist that governments should tread warily in trying to push through cultural change. Yet at a time when same-sex marriage has been delayed by awful politics in Canberra and when the domestic violence sector worries about momentum being lost as priorities shift and the media loses interest, the Victorian government is not playing it safe. Whatever is happening nationally and in other states, meanwhile in Victoria, it\u2019s all action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
