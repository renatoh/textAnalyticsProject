My ward and two schoolmates travelling to a music course in Italy, who had paid this fee and had no hand luggage other than their violin cases, were asked by Ryanair, when they checked in, to pay \u00a3300 each to buy seats for their instruments. Eventually they were permitted to check their violin cases into the hold and carry their violins \u2013 worth thousands of pounds \u2013 unprotected on their laps. Meanwhile the lockers above their seats were completely empty. Jane Ginsborg Sheffield"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
