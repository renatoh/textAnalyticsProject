Demonstrators set up stall - their jeers echoing around the square, placards bobbing above their heads reading \"Homo sex is a sin\". Soon afterwards, the crowd swelled considerably, more festive characters joining the throng: a woman carrying multicoloured balloons, a Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream van staffed by two women dressed as friesian cows. There were old and young, black and white, men and women, dogs, priests, babies in pushchairs. And the San Francisco Lesbian/Gay Freedom Band played on. They were all there for the wedding of Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, which was the first homosexual marriage ceremony to take place in California since the state's supreme court legalised gay marriage in May - the only US state after Massachusetts to do so. Lyon and Martin, a couple for more than 50 years, had been here before, in 2004, when they held their first legally-sanctioned wedding, only for their vows to be annulled some six months later. Their union had both political and emotional weight then, and shortly after five o'clock, when the newlyweds emerged, the square was wreathed in cheers. Two days after the wedding, the front room of their San Francisco home is filled with flowers and congratulatory cards. The pair bear all the hallmarks of a long-standing couple, laughing, quibbling and finishing each other's sentences. Martin, 87, the frailer of the two, is in cords, her hair a wild, surfy white; Lyon, 84, the more effervescent, is lipsticked, bespectacled. They sit side by side surrounded by the souvenirs of years spent campaigning for women's rights: boxes marked Lesbian Studies, VHS cassettes of feminist documentaries, framed photographs from their first wedding. \"It was exciting,\" Lyon says of last week's ceremony. \"We were brought in by a side door, then tottered upstairs. They have a long, long, long hall - we remembered it from 2004, when it seemed like we were going forever.\" Martin, who uses a wheelchair, stood for the service which was, Lyon laughs, \"over very fast ... four minutes?\" and declared them \"Spouses for life\". They did not wear white or carry bouquets. \"We wore what we wore the last time,\" smiles Lyon. \"That was simpler than trying to buy something new - God forbid.\" The union has certainly been a long time coming. Lyon and Martin first met in Seattle in the early 1950s when both were working as journalists on the same trade newspaper. At the time, Lyon wasn't even aware of the term \"lesbian\", but one night she, Martin and another colleague went for cocktails, \"and we got talking, and how we got on to the subject of homosexuality I don't recall ... Somewhere along the line we got to talking about it though, and Del's telling us this, that and the other. And one of us said, 'How come you know so much about this subject?' And she said, 'Because I am one!' And that was like, wow, this is something new and different, and I could hardly wait to get home so I could call all the other women in the office and tell 'em. Which I did,\" Lyon smiles neatly. \"And I thought, 'Oh my God, I'm gonna lose my job,'\" Martin adds. \"But she didn't,\" Lyon says softly. They were friends at first. It was only when Lyon announced that she would be leaving her job to join her sister on a road trip that their relationship shifted. \"What I always say is that we were sitting on the couch in my apartment,\" Lyon says, \"and she made half a pass at me and I had to make the other half, and then we had sex that night for the very first time, which was very interesting and certainly very different than I had been used to with men, and more fun I think, but anyway ...\" Lyon's eyes twinkle, and Martin looks quietly proud. Martin had been married before, to a man, though she explains that \"even when I was in high school I had crushes on girls, and I didn't know what that meant.\" She was working on a student publication when she met her husband. \"And you wanted to get away from home,\" Lyon takes up the story, \"and you met the advertising manager, and you started dating and he proposed and - I'm telling your life story,\" she smiles at Martin, \"and basically they got married and they had a kid and they had a divorce.\" In the 1950s, Martin and Lyon formed a ground-breaking organisation called Daughters of Bilitis. \"We were trying desperately to meet other lesbians,\" says Lyon, \"but somehow we couldn't make any contact. There were a lot of lesbian bars around the city and we'd go to them and we'd sit by ourselves and nobody ever came over and said, 'Hi, are you new to town? Who are you?'\" Through some gay acquaintances, they met another lesbian woman who, some months later, contacted them to see if they would be interested in joining a secret lesbian society with her and five other lesbians. \"And we said of course! We're going to meet five more lesbians!\" laughs Lyon. \"So that's how the Daughters of Bilitis started.\" Taking its name from Pierre Lou\u00ffs's poem The Songs of Bilitis, about a fictional lesbian contemporary of Sappho, the organisation was a bold move during a period of frequent police raids on lesbian bars, parties and homes, when even so much as dancing with a member of the opposite sex was illegal. At that time, there were no other lesbian organisations in the US. \"We thought we should be doing a little bit more than just having secret parties,\" Lyon explains. \"But it was very difficult to find people to join DOB because there was no way to advertise - the only thing the Chronicle published about gays was when they got arrested in a police raid.\" Gradually, though, the accumulated members launched a national newsletter and began holding discussion groups with guest speakers: \"For instance, a gay lawyer to come and speak about law in reference to gay people, and a woman psychiatrist - she was heterosexual - who came and spoke about how homosexuality is not a sickness, which nobody was doing in those days.\" For 14 years, and with chapters all across the country, they worked to support members of the lesbian community, particularly those afraid to declare their sexuality or persecuted for being homosexual. They also helped educate those outside the community, hoping to redress the complete lack of public knowledge about female homosexuality; they advertised themselves as A Woman's Organisation for the purpose of Promoting the Integration of the Homosexual into Society. Although they came out to their friends and to Martin's daughter, Kendra, they never openly discussed their relationship with their parents. \"Both our families lived in San Francisco, as did we,\" says Lyon, \"and you couldn't think that they were so stupid that they didn't know. But nobody ever said anything until one time Del's mother came to stay with us.\" Martin's mother, Mary, was a formidable woman, who they had nicknamed The General. One day, Lyon had an argument with Mary and it turned out that she \"had known all along, but she didn't know why we had to be so blatant about it. She didn't mind that we were lesbians but why did we have to let everybody in the world know?\" By this time they had written a book called Lesbian/Woman, a positive look at lesbian life in the US, which had been getting a lot of press, and Martin's sister Gertrude, who lived with Mary, had been desperately trying to make sure her mother didn't see any of the coverage. \"If there was anything on the television, she'd turn it off,\" says Lyon. \"If there was anything in the paper - and there was quite a bit in the paper - she'd cut it out. And I kept saying, 'What does Mary think when she picks up the paper every day and there's this big hole in it?'\" Lyon and Martin have long been active in the Democratic party, and in 1971 they started the Alice B Toklas Democratic Club - the first association for gay Democrats. \"And we had our first national conference in San Francisco, and had about 200 people come to the lectures and the banquet. As far as we could tell it was the biggest gathering of gay people ever.\" Though they have seen a great deal of support over the years, I wonder how Martin and Lyon have dealt with the hatred directed at them. The last few weeks, in particular, have seen an increase in crank phone calls: on Tuesday morning, one man called to ask, \"If you were dead and standing before God as an abomination, what would you say?\" Lyon smiles. \"I hung up on him.\" I mention that one of the claims of the protesters outside City Hall on the day of their wedding was that homosexuals were more likely to cheat on their partners - an assertion that seemed curious considering the couple getting married had been together for 50 years. Martin and Lyon laugh. Keeping their relationship alive for all this time has been a challenge, as it would be for anyone. \"When we first got together, and moved into the apartment it was difficult,\" recalls Lyon, \"because both of us had been living alone, we hadn't had this other person to trip over. And so we'd start arguments, and Del would just go out the front door and slam it and walk around the block then come back. I tried to teach Del to argue back. And then somebody gave us a kitten, which I've said kept us together for the first year, because we couldn't work out how to divide the kitten.\" They both smile. \"But we kept ourselves busy,\" she continues, \"and we bought the house and we got ourselves all wrapped up in each other, and we kept ourselves in love. And basically, that did it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
