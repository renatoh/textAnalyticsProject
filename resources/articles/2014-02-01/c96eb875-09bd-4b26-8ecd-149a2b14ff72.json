The team skating event, involving men's, women's, pairs and ice dancing, is making its first appearance at this Olympics and is being used by many skaters as a warm-up for the individual competitions. Nevertheless Russia showed prowess across the board, in a statement of intent before the individual performances. Evgeny Plushenko, 31, whose selection for Russia's individual men's skating raised eyebrows before the Games, justified his place by edging the free programme while the sensation of the Olympics so far, 15-year-old Yulia Lipnitskaya, was almost as impressive in her free programme as she had been in her short programme on Saturday. Plushenko had finished in second place after the short programme but had his task made easier by Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu, who pulled out of Sunday's free-skate portion, as well as Canada's Patrick Chan, both of whom said they wanted to focus on the individual programmes. The crowd went wild when Plushenko arrived on the ice and the skater flapped his arms towards his chest rapidly, as though to absorb the crowd's energy. He danced to a musical accompaniment called \u2013 what else \u2013 Best of Plushenko, a medley of all the pieces he has danced in previous competitions, and put in a solid, if imperfect performance. \"I love being first,\" said the skater, who was so devastated to miss out on gold in Vancouver that he made himself a special \"platinum medal\". He gave himself a \"B+\" for his performance on Sunday and thought he could do better. \"I felt a bit of pain in my back after the first salchow. That is maybe why I made the mistakes and did doubles,\" he said afterwards, referring to two planned triple salchows that did not come off properly. Nevertheless, his performance was good enough to edge first place from Canada's Kevin Reynolds, making the crowd ecstatic, with flowers lobbed into the rink from all sides. But even Plushenko was eclipsed by Russia's rising star, the prodigy Lipnitskaya, who has wowed judges and observers alike by combining elegance and extraordinary flexibility into a unique style. She skated into the rink with \"Yu-lia\" ringing in her ears and looking somewhat overwhelmed. She admitted to nerves, which prevented an excellent performance from becoming a flawless one. \"I got nervous in the middle of the programme, I'm not sure why, it's completely unlike me, so the jumps weren't great in the second half, I didn't feel totally comfortable. The jumps didn't feel like mine at that point. I wouldn't say I got tired but some errors still crept in.\" She will be aiming for a second gold in the individual event. \"Now I fully know the ice and the arena I can relax a bit and skate better in the individual event than I did today,\" she said. For Plushenko there had been speculation whether his health would allow him to skate in both the team and individual events, after multiple back surgeries and long periods out with injury. He was picked instead of the 18-year-old national champion Maxim Kovtun after dancing for judges behind closed doors, amid rumours that it was a political decision to pick him. He said on Sunday, however, that not only did he plan to skate the individual programmes but that he even had his eye on the 2018 games. \"I will be just 35 years old. No one has ever done it before. Why not? Perhaps I should try, I don't know. First I have to rest and talk to the doctors, perhaps implant some more stuff into my back. First I have to rest, though, and be with my family.\" Russia came third behind the USA and Canada in ice dancing but, by then, the team gold was wrapped up, with Canada taking the silver and the Americans bronze. Putin arrived half way through the event, wearing a bright red Team Russia tracksuit, and went to the side of the rink at the end to congratulate Russia's first gold medallists, chatting with Plushenko and patting Lipnitskaya on the head. Russia came 11th in the 2010 games in Vancouver, winning only three gold medals, and Putin said afterwards he expected Russia to top the table in Sochi. Since then Russian officials have backtracked somewhat but anything outside the top three would be seen as disappointing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
