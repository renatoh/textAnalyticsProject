Southampton are hopeful Tottenham will better Everton\u2019s offer. Tottenham manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has identified H\u00f8jbjerg as the holding player he needs to rebalance his midfield, and at 24 the one-time Bayern Munich wunderkind fits Spurs\u2019 ideal profile for a signing. Walker-Peters has enjoyed himself since joining Southampton on loan in January \u2013 he has played regularly since the Premier League\u2019s restart \u2013 and he is open to continuing his career at St Mary\u2019s. The biggest hurdle to overcome concerns the players\u2019 valuations. Southampton had put a \u00a335m price tag on H\u00f8jbjerg before lockdown but his situation has changed. The club have stripped him of the captaincy and he has been left out of the team in recent games. With one year to run on his contract, Southampton would seek about \u00a325m for him. Spurs rate Walker-Peters highly but Southampton will not pay a premium for a player with relatively little league experience. There is also the deflationary impact of coronavirus. The deals are being treated as separate entities \u2013 in other words,; the success or failure of one need not determine that of the other. Mourinho is under pressure to make a success of Spurs\u2019s record signing, Tanguy Ndombele, who joined last summer from Lyon for a little under \u00a360m on a lucrative six-year contract. The midfielder\u2019s value has decreased after a difficult first season but it would be hard to see Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, cutting any sort of losses on such an outlay. The discussion at Spurs has turned to how Mourinho \u2013 who has used Ndombele only sparingly \u2013 can create a platform for him to thrive. Signing H\u00f8jbjerg to play a disciplined role in front of the back four with Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, another expensive recruit, in more advanced positions in a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 has merit. Mourinho said last week that Spurs would not stand in Walker-Peters\u2019 way should the 23-year-old wish to move on. \u201cThe general feeling is there\u2019s a place for him here,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cBut if his desire is to be playing every time and leaving the club in search of happiness, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d stop him. He\u2019s a player with a good value in the market but I don\u2019t think we\u2019d stop him doing it.\u201d When Ralph Hasenhuttl was asked to clarify Southampton\u2019s general stance on Hojbjerg after Thursday\u2019s 1-1 draw with Brighton, the manager replied: \u201cWe only sell our players at the right price for us. Generally, he is our player, he has one more year on his contract, he doesn\u2019t want to extend his contract and we will see what will happen in the summer. It is not perfect for a player to go into the last months of his contract. We hope to find a solution that is the best for all [parties].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
