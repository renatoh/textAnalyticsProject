It spawned one monstrous YouTube hit: the unsettlingly cute and admonitory The Cigarette Duet, sung with Jonathan Bree of The Brunettes (a forgettable Sub Pop indie band which Nikkel sometimes tours with). The other songs were equally quirky but charming, caught somewhere between the brattish circus punk of Nikkel\u2019s first band Teen Wolf, virtuoso classical piano as played on toy instruments, the elegant languor of a Carla Bruni, and something subversive and creepy, like, say, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. She released two notable covers: one awful, one inspired in its multi-tracked layering and faux-na\u00efve musical instrumentation, its airy vocals reminiscent of 1980s Scots sweethearts Strawberry Switchblade. And that was Princess Chelsea until the release of The Great Cybernetic Depression: an intriguing irregularity surfing against tidal waves of in-your-face pop. Now it\u2019s 2015 and the time to move on is long overdue. Instead, Nikkel seems to have taken a tentative step backwards. Her second solo album is a watery pop confection that attempts the glitz and disaffected glam of a Lana Del Rey but comes off as sounding a bit, well, depressed. The opening lines of the Jonathan Bree duet, Is It All OK? seem to sum up the general feeling. \u201cSometimes I feel so sad/ I wish that I would die,\u201d Nikkel sighs over washes and washes of tinkling, trickling synth. To which Bree retorts: \u201cSometimes I get so bored/ It makes me want to cry\u201d, before the two protagonists relent into helpless acceptance of circumstance. Everyone is trapped in Princess Chelsea\u2019s self-created world of cyber-love and cyber-emotion. Think Fahrenheit 451 or Tron, except that both had their moments of release. The Great Cybernetic Depression is, as its title indicates, somewhat unrelenting in its miasma. And lurking somewhere far beyond the facade of doomed love and inability to come to terms with technological isolation, is the feeling that this is a little Flight of the Conchords. This is not to charge Princess Chelsea with being a postmodernist musical joke, more to indicate she is clearly aware of her situation and that awareness feeds into her performance. Or maybe it\u2019s not a performance? There are 10 songs here, co-produced by Nikkel and Bree, and the music is lush \u2013 baroque and fantastical and multi-layered and borne down with post-web 2.0 ennui \u2013 but it is same-y. It\u2019s like wandering into one of those retro-futuristic visions of suburbia from the 1950s, or music made by the denizens of The Sims, stifled by perfection. One song merges into the next. The single No Church On Sunday could be the crystalline Too Many People could be the crystalline All The Stars. The music veers between beautiful and dreary, often in the same refrain. Nikkel plays out her role well, embracing the sterility and conformity and artificiality of her digitalised world \u2013 so well in fact, that there is no room for any of the childish eccentricity of Lil Golden Book, and that\u2019s a shame. Are there any standouts? Her vocals on the tearless We\u2019re So Lost are somehow affecting, almost overwhelmingly sad. It\u2019s a wonderful song \u2013 but why it is any better than any of the others here, it is difficult to say. And her cat Winston\u2019s sampled meowing on Winston Crying On The Bathroom Floor is great, a tiny sweat-bead of emotion. She is aiming for The Magnetic Fields or Mountain Goats, but ends up nowhere near. The Great Cybernetic Depression is out now on Lil Chief Records"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
