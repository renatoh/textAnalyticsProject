However, the Castleford legend's presence in the tiny dressing rooms with which he is so familiar had an instant impact last night, as the Rhinos came from 10-2 behind to maintain their cushion over London in the battle for the fifth and final play-off position. Leeds appeared to be slumping to another humbling defeat until two tries in four minutes from Karl Pratt and Mark Calderwood midway through the second half. Instead, the Broncos need to win at Hull today or they will slip six points behind Leeds with four games to play. The Castleford players who have been linked with Leeds, Adrian Vowles and Danny Orr, were missing with injuries, while the Rhinos welcomed Gary Mercer, the veteran Kiwi who rejoined them for a second spell last week. There was plenty of passion, but not enough quality, in an opening half-hour which saw Kevin Sinfield give Leeds the lead with a penalty but fire another simple shot wide. A long pass from Mark Lennon caught Karl Pratt out of position, allowing Michael Eagar to cross. Lennon had also missed a simple penalty chance, but now converted from near touch to give the Tigers a 6-2 half-time lead. Castleford extended their lead in the third minute of the second half when a deft pick-up by Chris Charles set up the position for Jon Wells to cross in the right corner. Leeds finally began to show some invention, with Sinfield's flat pass finding Keith Senior, who scored their first try of the night. In the 61st minute they added a second when Pratt took a pass from Ryan Sheridan and spun over, and this time Sinfield goaled to nudge them 12-10 ahead. Pratt, again playing in the stand-off position vacated by Iestyn Harris, put in a hopeful kick which the Cas full-back Jason Flowers fumbled, allowing Calderwood to touch down, and a drop goal from Francis Cummins seven minutes from time secured a badly-needed win for Leeds.
