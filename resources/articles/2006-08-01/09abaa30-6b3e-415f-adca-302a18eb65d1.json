They drink lots of water, go easy on the vodka and spritz themselves with Evian from the moment they disappear behind the first-class curtain. But assuming you haven't been quite so restrained, what can you do to stop jet lag skin making you one of those annoying people who refuses to be photographed before day three of their holiday? The most important thing is to clean your skin properly. Face wipes supplied with your airline dinner are fine if you want a nice selection of pimples, but otherwise please don't clean anything other than your hands with them. If you want to be a real princess, give your face a quick clean with bottled water and your regular cleanser or a proper face wipe (ie, one you've brought with you) before you get off the plane. Either way, when you arrive, the best way to revive tired skin is to clean it and give it a gentle exfoliation. Face masks come into their own post-flight, and the more hydrating the better. Super sensitive skins should try Dr Hauschka's Rejuvenating Mask, Origins' Drink Up or, my personal favourite, Dermalogica's Multi- Vitamin Power Recovery Mask, which can be left on overnight. If you've subjected your skin to long haul, This Works' Turbo Balm or Decl\u00e9or's Essential Balm works well (again overnight), but leave such products on for a long time only once you're sure your skin likes it. Finally, puffy eyes: the real reason celebs never get off a plane without bug-eyed sunglasses is because they don't want you to see their eye masks underneath. Try Shiseido's Pure Retinol Instant Treatment Eye Mask or Dr Hauschka's Eye Solace. Failing that, you could always get the train."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
