Its vice-chancellor, Dr Malcolm McVicar, is unhappy with the government's proposals to auction 20,000 places to institutions that charge an average of \u00a37,500 or less from autumn 2012. His university intends to charge the maximum tuition fees of \u00a39,000. McVicar is unhappy with the plan to allow universities to take as many students with AAB grades at A-level as they can. It will leave universities in the middle \"very squeezed\", he said. \"This is deeply worrying. When we set our fees, we did so to replace grants that the government cut. If we were forced to charge \u00a37,500, we would have to think extremely carefully about which subjects we offered and how we maintained quality.\" 2 University of Nottingham The University of Nottingham is one of the hardest to get into, with almost 10 applicants for every place. The Guardian's University guide ranked it 19th in the UK. Many students with two As and a B in their A-levels apply to Nottingham, said Dr Paul Greatrix, the university's registrar. The average student probably has an A and two Bs, he says. But the university has no immediate plans to expand the number of students it admits. He predicts that universities will fight for top students even more than they do now and try to tempt them with scholarships. Greatrix is not happy with some of the government's proposals to encourage private organisations to offer degrees. \"If there are entrants who are on the extreme end of cheap and cheerful, this will damage our international reputation,\" he says. 3 New College Durham New College Durham is a further education college with about 1,500 students doing higher education courses. Its fee for degree courses next year will be \u00a36,000 and, like many FE colleges, it hopes to gain from the expansion of places for institutions with an average fee of \u00a37,500 or less. Its principal, John Widdowson, said: \"The ability to offer additional places is really welcome. There is demand from people who want to study locally, and do vocational qualifications. We can certainly see expansion across the board, in areas like business studies and more specific vocational qualifications like sport and leisure management. \"[Colleges] will fill these 20,000 places pretty quickly and still find there's unmet demand.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
