Haenel, 30, who has won a string of awards for her work, including two French Oscars, said she was subjected to \u201cpermanent sexual harassment\u201d by Christophe Ruggia from the age of 12 to 15 when she was making and promoting her debut 2002 film, The Devils, in which she played a girl with autism. She told an investigation by the French website Mediapart that she considered the director\u2019s actions to be child abuse and sexual harassment. She said it included \u201cforced kisses on the neck\u201d and \u201crepeated touching\u201d to the thighs and torso, and that it happened at the director\u2019s apartment and during several international film festivals. Ruggia has denied the accusations, with his lawyers saying that he \u201ccategorically refuted\u201d any misconduct. Haenel, who has won praise internationally with her recent performance in the French film Portrait of a Lady on Fire, gave a live-streamed interview on the Mediapart site in which she said silence must be broken around the targeting and abuse of children. \u201cMonsters don\u2019t exist,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our society we\u2019re talking about. Our fathers, our friends, our brothers. As long as we don\u2019t see this, we\u2019ll never move forward.\u201d She said she spoke out after watching Leaving Neverland, a documentary about alleged abuse carried out by the US pop star Michael Jackson. When she discovered that Ruggia was to make another film with teenagers, she decided to go public. She said: \u201c[Ruggia] put a system in place to isolate me, to have him at his place every weekend \u2026 It was a man of nearly 40 who every week got himself into a room with a young girl who was between 12 and 15 and tried to touch her up. There was no ambiguity in the situation \u2026 it wasn\u2019t romantic, it was pure pressure. I was stuck to the sofa. I froze in the centre of all this.\u201d Mediapart spoke to dozens of people, many involved in the making of The Devils, about an incestuous relationship between 12-year-old siblings. Many expressed concern about the director\u2019s approach to Haenel. Haenel said the experience had traumatised her and that at the time she never wanted to make another film. The French society of film directors (SRF) said it was expelling Ruggia in light of the accusations. \u201cWe want to express our total support, our admiration and recognition of the actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel, who had the courage to speak out after so many years of silence,\u201d it said in a statement on Monday. Ruggia, 54, who is also known for The Kid from Chaaba, is a former co-president of the organisation. He said he had a \u201cprofessional and affectionate relationship\u201d with Haenel. The director\u2019s lawyer, Jean-Pierre Versini, said that while the film-maker may have had \u201can involuntary, adult, director\u2019s hold on her\u2026 he categorically denies touching or sexually harassing her\u201d when she was a minor. Haenel said she was shocked that he denied it, adding: \u201cYou have to recognise it, it is more violence denying it. And I am even more shocked by the fact that he says he discovered me, because really he destroyed me.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2019 to clarify the content of the documentary Leaving Neverland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
