For example Cheshire Building Society dropped the rates on some of its savings accounts by 0.25% in June only to cut them again by 0.25% from next week. Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society, which cut savings accounts in March, cut them by 0.4% this week. So just because your savings provider has already cut rates this year, it doesn't mean you will be spared a further reduction."}, "isHosted": false}}}
