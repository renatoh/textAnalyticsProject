We are a completely independent expert group basing our reports on a wide range of sources and evidence, including academia, practitioners, NGOs and industry, but quite separate from them. The statement in your article that our report recommends \u201ca slew of industry positions\u201d on pesticides is incorrect. What was recommended in our report was that the European commission \u201cfacilitates a broader discussion throughout society to establish an EU-wide, shared vision for food production, including the role of plant protection products therein\u201d. Likewise, it is incorrect to say that we recommend replacing current rules outlawing any products that could harm human health with a US-style concept of \u201cacceptable risk\u201d. What our report says is that the European commission should \u201cre-examine the treatment of hazards, risks, costs and benefits \u2013 to provide reassurance that the system is fit for purpose\u201d.
