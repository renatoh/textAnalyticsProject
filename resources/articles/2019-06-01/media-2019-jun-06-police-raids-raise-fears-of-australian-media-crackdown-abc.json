When she heard a knock at the front door, she assumed it was her cleaner. Instead there were five federal police officers on the doorstep, pursuing evidence relating to a story she had written more than 12 months earlier. The police presented their warrants. The journalist told them she wanted a lawyer. Two legal representatives arrived at her house shortly afterwards. The search started in Smethurst\u2019s bedroom. While that was under way, another two officers arrived with electronic equipment to go through her phone and computers. The police wanted access to all her electronic equipment. They asked for her passwords, downloaded the contents of her phone on to their computer and used keyword searches to check the stored data. While the electronic dump was under way, police looked under Smethurst\u2019s bed, through her clothes, handbags and sewing basket, through the spare room, through her cookbooks and stored Christmas decorations. They picked up 20 USBs in the house and checked them. The search spanned seven hours, with the group leaving about 4.30pm. \u201cI felt shocked,\u201d Smethurst told the Guardian. \u201cI was very cooperative, and to be fair, they were too. They had a warrant. There was very little I could do apart from sitting down and watching them go through the search. \u201cBut it\u2019s a very confronting thing, watching somebody go through the house you\u2019ve lived in for five years. It was uncomfortable. \u201cI was very stressed when they were on my phone. Obviously as a journalist, my business model relies on people being able to ring me and talk to me anonymously, with that information not being seen by anyone else, then all of a sudden, police had access to it, and it was an incredible invasion of privacy.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s raid in Canberra, which came without any warning, was connected to a scoop revealing a plan by one of Australia\u2019s surveillance agencies, the Australian Signals Directorate, to broaden its powers to spy on citizens without their knowledge. It was published in April 2018, and referred immediately for police investigation. The raid on Smethurst\u2019s home, following hot on the heels of a federal election, was disconcerting enough for the Australian media, but a second raid followed on Wednesday in Sydney at Australia\u2019s national public broadcaster, the ABC. This one related to an investigation about alleged unlawful killings in Afghanistan by Australian special forces, broadcast in July 2017. The story was referred for police investigation the day after broadcast. The ABC \u2013 unlike Smethurst and the Sunday Telegraph\u2019s owner, News Corp \u2013 was aware the search was coming. John Lyons, the head of investigations at the national broadcaster, decided to remain in the room while police worked and live tweet Wednesday\u2019s operation. The scope of the warrant \u201cstaggered\u201d the veteran journalist. He told his followers the warrant allowed the police to \u201cadd, copy, delete or alter\u201d material in the ABC\u2019s computers. \u201cThis would not be allowed to happen in the United States under their constitution,\u201d Lyons said while the raid was in progress. \u201cMy question is why is this allowed to happen in Australia in 2019.\u201d The answer to that question is multi-dimensional. Australia has a global reputation for robust plain-speaking, both in the broader culture and in its politics, but it does not have a bill of rights enshrining protections for free speech and a free press. There is no explicit constitutional protection for expression. The high court has determined that an implied freedom of political communication exists. As well as a lack of basic systemic protections, Australia has an onerous defamation regime that media companies have heavily criticised. There are also restrictions on what can be reported from court proceedings. Overlaid on all that is the post-September 11 framework of national security laws. The Australian journalist Peter Greste, who was imprisoned by Egyptian authorities while reporting for al-Jazeera English, and is a founding director of the Alliance for Journalists\u2019 Freedom, points to \u201ca slew of national security laws\u201d passed by the Australian parliament in recent years \u201cthat in some way limit and even criminalise the legitimate work of journalists\u201d. \u201cWhether it is section 35p of the Asio Act, or the foreign fighters legislation, the Data Retention Act, or the Foreign Interference and Espionage Act, to name a few, all in some way make it dangerous for journalists or their sources to expose and report on issues within government that you and I ought to know about,\u201d Greste said. The current police actions relate to offences in the criminal code. Australian law criminalises unauthorised disclosures by public servants, and there are also provisions that prohibit the subsequent publication of proscribed information. That puts both whistleblowers and journalists in the frame. The acting federal police commissioner, Neil Gaughan, confirmed to journalists on Thursday it was an offence to have proscribed material on news websites, but he was more coy about whether prosecutions for journalists would be forthcoming. David McBride, a whistleblowing lawyer who shared material with the ABC about controversial military activity in Afghanistan, is already before the courts. The president of the Law Council of Australia, Arthur Moses, said: \u201cWhat this case demonstrates, and it\u2019s quite timely, is we don\u2019t have a bill of rights in this country. That exposes media outlets to these kinds of offences. \u201cThe Law Council has been saying for some period of time there needs to be a bill of rights in order to harmonise protections for citizens and the fourth estate to make sure they can maintain sunlight on conduct of government that may result in an abuse of power.\u201d Moses said when news first broke of the police raid at Smethurst\u2019s home, relating to the story about an agency\u2019s ambitions to expand its surveillance powers, \u201cit wasn\u2019t readily clear to us why that would be a national security issue\u201d. \u201cThe people of Australia are entitled to know if bureaucrats are proposing that laws be enacted that give them more powers to conduct surveillance of citizens. \u201cUltimately the Australian citizens in a democracy empower our parliaments to enact laws in our name. They are entitled to know if a bureaucrat wishes [to obtain more power] and understand who is proposing that, why they are proposing it and is it proportionate to the risk \u2013 that is, is the loss of the right of privacy and freedom proportionate to the risk that is being pointed to as the reason for these powers?\u201d Moses said a lot of anger had been directed at federal police since the raids, but he thought that was misplaced. \u201cThe issue here is the laws need to be reviewed,\u201d he said. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has left the door open to concerns about the application of the laws, and says the governing coalition is \u201cabsolutely committed to freedom of the press\u201d. The Labor opposition\u2019s newly appointed home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, noted on Thursday that many in the community were viewing the raids as the \u201cfirst steps down a slippery slope to losing a free press in Australia\u201d. Smethurst said everyone understood journalists needed to operate within the legal system. \u201cNobody is above the law,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think this was a bit over the top and heavy-handed. \u201cI could have cooperated. I was never contacted by the police or asked to answer any questions or bring in a computer for searching. It felt very intimidating.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
