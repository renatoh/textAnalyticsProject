One immediate response was anger at Sir Michael Stoute, who some believed may have put punters away with his pessimistic bulletins about the winner Russian Rhythm in the lead-up to the race. Stoute has hardly been the most forthcoming with the media in the past, but on this count it seems he must be found not guilty. We understand the feeling among many stable insiders as late as the eve of the race was that the filly wouldn't run such had been the inconsistency of her prep work for the Classic. You talkin' to me? Why waste millions, as many believe the British Horseracing Board did marketing racing, when stars such as Robert De Niro add instant cachet by just turning up, as he did complete with scruffy beard at Naas races with his friend Bono on Monday. He jetted back to New York for the Tribeca Film Festival but not before being spotted with Bono again leaving Claridges Hotel in Dublin clutching a book on autism, fuelling speculation about his next movie project. One ready for the elite Nothing has illustrated more the overwhelming success of racing syndicates, in which hundreds of ordinary punters have shares in horses, than Elite Racing who ran Soviet Song in the 1,000 Guineas. She got an enormous cheer on the way to the start in front of the packed stands and a bigger one than even winner Russian Rhythm when she took fourth spot. The feeling from those close to the filly is that the lack of a prep race told in the closing stages and that she could well have gone close if she had run in one of the Guineas trials. Keep her in mind for a big prize this year. Newmarket's new way with marketing Newmarket are busy innovating in all areas and positioned bookmakers well away from the betting ring near the shopping village and big screen showing the crucial Premiership football matches on Guineas weekend. 'We want to encourage more racegoers to use this part of the course,' said the course's go-ahead managing director Lisa Hancock when we bumped into her as she chatted to the layers about how the experiment was going. Hancock is certainly doing all she can to bring back disgruntled users of the Members' enclosure into the fold. They not only have full use of a block of seats in the new stand but are getting free, much-improved racecards at Newmarket's major fixtures. Fallon falls in Champion jockey Kieren Fallon has returned from his stint in an Irish drying-out clinic in the winter in better shape than ever and, after a vintage week at Newmarket, winning on Russian Rhythm, and Chester is now odds-on with the bookmakers to ride 200 winners this season. As one wag on the Attheraces TV channel put it this week: 'If he's an example of what happens to you when you stop drinking, I don't want to ever touch another drop.' Ooh, you are naughty As a callow youth, Attheraces pundit James Willoughby arrived at Mark Johnston's door looking for a start in the sport, a fact the Middleham trainer reminded him of with a little ribbing in print in the Racing Post recently. So Willoughby was perhaps being a shade naughty when he revealed on air last Tuesday that Johnston's best unraced two-year-old is a son of Dr Fong. 'Ooh, I shouldn't have let that slip,' he confessed. He didn't furnish viewers with the name but we can reveal that the two possibilities from the Johnston string are Fort and Snap. Get past the line first, buddy Fergal Lynch's fall from Kris Kin in the shadow of the post as he celebrated victory at Chester on Thursday was surely a timely warning that the modern-day vogue for obligatory celebrations in big races, which many jockeys start before they have crossed the line, is going to result in someone losing a major prize one day. Mine's a Triple The 2,000 guineas winner Refuse To Bend is dividing the experts already with some suggesting that he is an ideal St Leger type, while others are saying he won't stay the two-furlong shorter trip of the Derby in a horsebox. Speculation in the Racing Post that he may go for the traditional Guineas-Derby-St Leger Triple Crown would be deeply embarrassing for the British Horseracing Board who recently announced an alternative prize, the BHB Triple Crown and Grand Slam, worth a total of \u00a36m. King George is the decider Ever since First Gold dotted up at Punchestown the other week and followed up his runaway victory in the Martell Cognac Cup at Aintree, there has been much talk of the clash between the back-to-form chaser and the current champion Best Mate in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. But surely the big test will be at Kempton at Christmas in the King George, which First Gold won in such impressive fashion in 2000 and Best Mate won last year. The Kempton race, and not the Gold Cup, is the one that normally produces the champion steeplechaser and will be a much fairer indication of who is the better of the pair. What's In A Name? Franklins Gardens, who won the 3.15 at Lingfield yesterday, is 'going to be a very nice horse', according to trainer Mark Tompkins. He is named after the home ground of Northampton Rugby Club, whose club chairman, Keith Barwell, is husband to the owner, Maggie Barwell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
