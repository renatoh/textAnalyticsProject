The union's current situation is not the end of the road, but a new beginning. Europe can emerge even stronger, if we have the courage to be honest with each other. Why have we reached this impasse? Not because Dutch and French voters rejected the constitutional treaty, nor because European leaders failed to agree on a budget for the union. Those events were the result of developments beneath the surface, which received too little attention for far too long. Seen from that vantage point, we should not blame each other or talk about a crisis, but think about how to make the most of this opportunity for reflection and reform. Despite the result of our referendum, when Dutch people are asked \"Do you support EU membership?\", more than three-quarters say yes. Only in Luxembourg and Ireland is the percentage higher. None the less, it is increasingly clear that the public's attitude towards Europe has changed. The desire for peace and stability is no longer an ironclad argument for further European integration. In a relatively short time, the EU has undergone tremendous growth, which made it possible to spread prosperity and stability to the new member states. But as diversity has grown, it has weakened people's sense of belonging to a larger whole, and not just in the Netherlands. Many people are worried about the future. Despite their concerns, very little money is available to reform the EU, even though reform is vital to establish a position of strength relative to the US and China. Most of the EU budget is reserved for agricultural subsidies and support for regions in wealthy countries - a fact that has not escaped public attention. In this period of slow growth, it would be irresponsible to increase the total budget. There is a better solution: reforming the existing budget to prepare for the future. We have had a rude awakening: but it may have been just the wake-up call we need. Ordinary people want to be more involved in the EU's development. The fear of a European superstate played a decisive part in the Dutch referendum debates, as did concerns about the fast pace of European integration. The EU exists for its citizens, and their concerns and wishes should play a central role in decisions about European cooperation. I am pleased that member states have agreed to a period of reflection. After we have thought things through, I do not believe we will settle for an enhanced customs union. We depend on the EU for much more. Do we want an EU that focuses primarily on consolidation of vested interests, or one that pursues reform and displays solidarity with the less prosperous member states and the world around it? European agriculture is of great importance, and we must not overlook farmers and their families. But the current system, with rivers of subsidy flowing out of Brussels, cannot last until late in the 21st century. And is it fair for Brussels to spend so much of its limited resources on regions in rich member states? Wouldn't that money be put to better use in the poor regions of the less prosperous new member states? How can we develop a new financial system offering greater scope for research, innovation, international environmental policy and the fight against transnational crime? When the European council discussed the budget for the years ahead, these questions loomed large. The Netherlands wishes to show solidarity and be a dependable European partner. The proof is in our actions. For years, Dutch families have been paying more towards European solidarity than families in other wealthy member states. What the Netherlands would like is to make a net contribution comparable to the member states in a similar economic situation. This is an entirely legitimate wish. It is neither unfair nor selfish for the Netherlands, which for years has made the largest net contributions per head of population, to ask for the same treatment as comparable wealthy countries. Thanks to painful reforms , we have stayed within the bounds of the stability and growth pact. Dutch citizens have had to make sacrifices. But by creating a stable financial and economic climate, we are laying the foundation for growth in Europe. We want a union with which the public can feel comfortable; which shows solidarity with the least prosperous member states; and in which vital reforms prevail over vested interests. Some fear that everything Europe has achieved is under threat. This period of reflection is an opportunity to ward off lurking threats and lead the EU to new resilience and legitimacy. \u00b7 Jan Peter Balkenende is the prime minister of the Netherlands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
