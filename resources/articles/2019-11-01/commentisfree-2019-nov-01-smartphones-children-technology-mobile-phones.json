And experts are worried", "bodyText": "A report released by Common Sense Media on Tuesday found that by age 11, 53% of kids in the US have their own smartphone. And 69% do by the time they\u2019re 12. This surge in phone ownership and the increased screen time associated with it comes amid growing concerns from experts and people like me that phones are bad for kids. I\u2019ve traveled the country over the last few years talking to parents and teachers about kids and social media. I\u2019ve heard stories about everything from non-consensually shared nudes in their schools to smartphone addiction \u2013 kids can\u2019t seem to put their phones down, which teachers say is disrupting class time and causing innumerable fights and misunderstandings. Everybody wants to know: \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d They\u2019re all for limiting screen time \u2013 though it\u2019s hard, they say; their kids act like addicts when you try to take away their drugs \u2013 but when you raise the question of not giving kids phones at all, they balk. \u201cHow can we do that?\u201d parents ask. \u201cOur kids will have no social life. They won\u2019t be able to function in the modern world.\u201d Leaving this received wisdom aside for the moment, let\u2019s look at all the other things kids won\u2019t be able to do if they don\u2019t have a phone. They won\u2019t be able to be part of a group chat, the site of hours of distracting discussions which arguably would be better had in person, where face-to-face interaction would elevate the quality of the conversation and deepen social bonds. They won\u2019t be able to send or receive nudes, which has increasingly become their first introduction to the world of sex. The exchange of nudes at a young age (I\u2019ve reported it happening as young as the sixth grade) is thankfully no longer being normalized as just a \u201cnew kind of flirting\u201d any more, now that it has become clear that it often takes place in an atmosphere of pressure or coercion \u2013 not to mention the real danger of nudes turning into revenge porn, the source of ruined lives. Phones enable kids to surf the internet unmonitored; most I\u2019ve spoken to know of ways to get around the parental apps watching over their devices. And frankly, many parents are too distracted themselves or too trusting of the presumed innocence of social media to even check what their kids are doing online. I remember the dad in St Louis who argued: \u201cMy [14-year-old] son does not watch porn.\u201d I hear that a lot. He later emailed to tell me that, when he actually checked his son\u2019s phone, he saw that he was watching porn several times a day. Whatever your view of the effects of porn on children (studies say it can cause an increased tolerance for sexual violence in both girls and boys), we have agreed as a society, by our laws, that they should not watch it; and yet with phones, they can watch it whenever, wherever. I\u2019ve heard from girls about how common it is to see \u201cboys watching porn in school\u201d. Explicit content doesn\u2019t have to be porn. It\u2019s readily available on YouTube and across all social media platforms. A kid with a phone will inevitably see something his or her parents would be appalled to know he or she has seen. \u201cConsumer groups caution that despite promises to police inappropriate content, YouTube continues to show violent imagery, drug references, racist language and sexually suggestive content that reaches children,\u201d reported the Washington Post. The Common Sense Media survey reported that twice as many kids are watching mostly YouTube videos every day as they did four years ago, and the average time spent watching videos has about doubled, to an hour each day. And yes, often these are just videos of their favorite pop stars or clips from their favorite TV shows; but sometimes they are videos of the most horrible things imaginable. This type of exposure is not without its emotional effects; nor is the constant pressure that comes with a phone to broadcast one\u2019s life \u2013 one\u2019s inauthentically perfect, happy, glorious life. This pressure is particularly toxic for girls, who in study after study in recent years are seen to be struggling with rising rates of anxiety and depression and even suicide connected to the use of phones and social media. But sure, go ahead and buy your 11-year-old a phone. What could possibly go wrong?
