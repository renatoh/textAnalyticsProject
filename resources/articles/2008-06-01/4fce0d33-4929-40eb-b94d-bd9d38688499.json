The political climate is unstable but, to begin with at least, politics has little bearing on the life of Kambili, the 15-year-old convent schoolgirl narrator. Far more sinister than any military coup is her father, a wealthy industrialist educated by Catholic missionaries, whose religious zeal and sadistic physical abuse has reduced his wife and two teenage children to mute, terrified zombies. Only when Kambili and her brother Jaja go to stay with their aunt, a university lecturer, and her children do they realise that conversation, opinion, arguments and above all laughter are normal in a family home. Adjoa Andoh's characterisation of the narrator, whose confused love/hate relationship with her father underpins the story, is stunning. If Brian Moore's Black Robe shook your beliefs in the virtues of Christian evangelism, after Purple Hibiscus you'll probably join the Dawkins-Hitchens atheist club. Sea of Poppies Amitav Ghosh, read by Lyndam Gregory (4\u00bdhrs abridged, John Murray, \u00a314.99) This is the first in Ghosh's nautical trilogy set aboard the Ibis, a converted 19th-century \"blackbirder\" or slave ship carrying an extraordinary cast of characters from Calcutta to Mauritius on the eve of the opium wars. As the world's number one harvester of poppies for conversion to opium, Bihar was the Victorian equivalent of modern Afghanistan. Among the passengers, migrants, coolies and convicts on the Ibis are Deeti, dramatically rescued from committing suttee at her husband's funeral, the beautiful, desperate Paulette Lambert, fleeing from her guardian disguised as a native, and a bankrupt maharaja. The crew are an equally motley bunch: an opium-addicted captain, an American first officer, son of a plantation owner, and a violent first mate. Murder, rape, mutiny - life on the Ibis may lack the enigmatic subtlety of HMS Pandora in William Golding's maritime trilogy To the Ends of the Earth, but it certainly has more action. Nor, I suspect, would you appreciate the multicultural richness of the story without reader Lyndam Gregory's ability to switch accents: posh Indian, estuary Chinese, Midlands nasal, French, Punjabi - he does them all brilliantly. The Road Cormac McCarthy, read by Tom Stechschulte (7hrs unabridged, Recorded Books, \u00a322.99) \"He saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world, the cold relentless circling of the intestate earth, darkness implacable . . .\" After you've read McCarthy's 2006 Pulitzer prize-winning novel about survival you will understand the true meaning of the word \"bleak\". Some nameless global catastrophe has left the planet locked in permanent winter without sun, without wildlife and covered with ash. Pushing a supermarket trolley with their few pitiful possessions - blankets, some tinned food - a man and his young son follow the road south over the mountains to the coast, where, with luck, they might meet some good guys. They've had narrow escapes from bad guys, feral bands of armed cannibals whose victims' bones litter the burnt-out cities through which they trudge. Yet somehow, for all the harrowing hopelessness, the bond between father and son shines through. Ultimately it is a story about love.
