'Not really,' she says. 'I'm not much of a drinker. I've got this theory that it would be nice if any problem in life could be solved by having a Bellini at Cipriani's. Because Bellinis are pink and bubbly and always makes you feel really good, and because I do love Cipriani's - particularly the outfits that the waiters wear: white gloves, a white Tuxedo and a white bow tie. And wouldn't it be great if that were really the case, if a Bellini was all it took? But what British people don't seem to realise about New York is that Sex and the City was fictional, and girls in New York do not spend their whole lives drinking Cosmopolitans. It's not viable. In actual fact, they drink very little at all.' Women in Britain drink a great deal, on the other hand. I am a cocktail reviewer and therefore professionally obliged to booze, but the fact is, I would drink (often, and too much) even if it wasn't for work, and so would pretty much everyone I know. We drink because we're happy, or sad, or bored; we meet up for 'really, just one', on every third weekday night, and end up reeling back to our flats, smashed, hours later. If we're at home on our own with the TV, we will often do the better part of a bottle of red. We work our responsible, grown-up jobs through varying degrees of hangover three days out of five. We are more than capable of drinking till we're sick, even though we're in our thirties. In this, and in many other ways it transpires, we are nothing like Plum and her crowd. Plum is holding a seminar for one (me) in the tearoom of the Berkeley Hotel in London's Knightsbridge, on the business of being socially successful in Manhattan. I have so far ascertained that getting mindlessly Martini-addled on a regular basis is the quickest way to not qualify for Plum's crowd. Chic New York hotel bars, it seems, are for seeing, and being seen in, and not for getting drunk, emotional and falling over in. 'For example,' says Plum, smoothing back absurdly glossy hair, and crossing absurdly long legs, 'if you sit in the lobby of the Mercer Hotel with a drink for half an hour, you get the most incredible fashion show. From, like, the hip-hop moguls to the models to the icons... Me and Lucy [her twin sister] go there sometimes, and we're like, \"It's so entertaining!\" The most amazing outfits.' My friends and I like hotel bars, too, but mostly because you don't have to physically stand up and cross the room to repeat order your champagne, on account of the waiter service, and also because they're much better at getting you a cab home when you get up to use the loo and discover that the room is moving. I choose not to share this. Plum and her crowd like restaurants more than they like bars, she explains. Not, predictably, for the food. British girls and Manhattan girls both aspire towards extreme thinness - although Manhattan girls are much better at it, Plum thinks, because 'these girls are so frantic and frenetic, they're losing weight every breath'. So. Restaurants are for networking in, and for demonstrating relative social might by securing a good table at a good time. 'Right now,' says Plum, 'there's a restaurant called Sant Ambroeus. It calls itself an \"Italian Confetteria\", whatever that means. And it's in a very trendy residential zone on West 4th Street and the corner of Perry Street. You've got Graydon Carter [editor of Vanity Fair magazine] living round the corner, oh, and Ethan Hawke and whatever. And I went there the other night, and there was Richard Avedon at one table, Miucca Prada at another, and Patrick Demarchelier at another! I thought: \"Well, this is obviously the place to be!\".' There's also Matsuri, she says, an amazing new Japanese place in the basement of the Maritime Hotel, where 'the waitresses wear kimonos, but it's not done in a themed, Disney way'; also Spice Market, where it's virtually impossible to get a table before midnight (unless you're Plum) and also: 'You could tell with Spice Market that, even though it has only been open for two weeks, it was already going down the wrong road. There were just too many leather jackets there on men. Do you know what I mean? Too much oiled hair and leather jackets, and you think, \"I don't really want to be here\".' So how does a person know if a restaurant's really fashionable, I wonder (after failing to impress Plum by revealing that I'd been to what I'd imagined to be terminally hip Balthazar last time I was in New York, and learning that: 'Balthazar is really only for the tourists.') 'You can just tell,' Plum reveals, airily. 'If you're a person with taste and good instincts, you can tell if you're in a good place or not. Although [fashion designer] Zac Posen was on the table next to me at Matsuri, which helped.' Indeed. Just as I am giving up all hope of becoming a transatlantic disciple of Plum, I am heartened to learn that neither she nor I cook, and that not cooking is a good signifier of fabulousness in Manhattan. 'I don't need to cook,' Plum says. 'Right opposite my house is a restaurant called Caf\u00e9 Rosso, and I'll go in and say: \"Can I have a glass of wine and a bowl of pasta to take up to my house?\" And they'll give it to me, like I'm in a hotel.' As for the dinner-party scene: 'No one would ever refer to a dinner party as a \"dinner party\" in New York. They'll call it: \"let's have a dinner.\" And that could mean \"let's 10 of us go out to a restaurant\" or \"I'm having a dinner, at my house, super-duper casual\". Although, there's no such thing as super-duper casual in New York. I remember I went to a dinner in the Hamptons, super-duper casual, and I got there, and the hostess was in a John Galliano dress, and I was in jeans, and there were, like, 40 waiters and 40 guests. I felt pretty stupid.' I'm out of my depth again. There are other, cool-crowd Manhattan etiquette issues, I learn. No one smokes inside any more, unless they are Harvey Weinstein, in which case 'people are forewarned, and big mogul types can just get away with it. Smoking is very much a sign of power, now.' (In my crowd, smoking is very much a sign that I've forgotten I don't smoke, and cadged a Marlboro Light off a man I was trying to impress, but didn't.) You should also absolutely embrace all opportunities to dress up as much as you can. 'Sometimes, I'm inspired by Liz Hurley, and will put on my white jeans and my white cashmere sweater. I've got a whole Liz Hurley section to my wardrobe.' (Hoorah! So have I!) 'I went to the Met Ball on Monday night, and I wore an Alexander McQueen gown, which was really fun.' (Ah. I've never worn an Alexander McQueen anything to anywhere.) Also - unlike my London scene, where everybody has an hour's grace on arriving late at social gatherings because we're a bunch of hapless ditherers who always underestimate how long it will take to get anywhere - there is categorically no option on being fashionably late in Manhattan. 'No. Not done. People are punctual, extremely punctual. Everyone's busy, they're working really hard, they've got major careers, so they don't stay out late. It is becoming increasingly apparent that I am not shaping up as a nascent Manhattan social queen, on any level. I lack the discipline, the wardrobe and the will. I am, however, endlessly impressed by Plum and her kind (despite the fact that I'm fundamentally suspicious of non-drinkers). I'm also well and truly with her on the Bellini theory. Except that I believe that most problems in life can be solved with an entry-level five champagne cocktails. Which either says a lot about my alcohol-tolerance levels, or a lot about my problems.
