The London club were given a two-window suspension by Fifa for breaches of the rules regarding their dealings with overseas players under the age of 18 and they served the first one last summer. But they will not now serve the second in January after Cas ruled that Fifa\u2019s punishment was too harsh. Chelsea had been investigated by Fifa over alleged transgressions regarding 150 players, with the most serious charges concerning those that related to article 19 of the governing body\u2019s regulations. The club were found by Fifa to have broken this rule in 27 cases. But in a judgement that rocked Fifa, Cas stated that Chelsea had only transgressed in \u201cabout a third\u201d of these particular cases. Cas also reduced their fine by half to 300,000 Swiss Francs (\u00a3230,000). It is difficult to overstate how angry Chelsea are with Fifa \u2013 given they had fully co-operated with a long-running investigation \u2013 and what has made it worse is the perception at Stamford Bridge that City have all but got away with similar rule breaches over a similar period from 2009. City were fined 370,000 Swiss Francs in August for violations of the regulations regarding the recruitment of minors yet they avoided a transfer ban. Chelsea expressed gratitude to Cas for finding in their favour but they did not pull their punches in relation to what they felt was a bias from Fifa which called into question its fitness for purpose. \u201cThe approach taken by Fifa to this case has been deeply unsatisfactory, not least as Fifa chose to treat Chelsea entirely differently to Manchester City for reasons that make absolutely no sense to Chelsea,\u201d a Chelsea statement read. \u201cChelsea respects the importance of the work undertaken by Fifa in relation to the protection of minors and has fully cooperated with Fifa throughout its investigation. However, if Fifa continues to impose inconsistent and unequal sanctions on clubs then it will not only undermine the very purpose of the regulations but it will also bring into doubt the game\u2019s confidence in Fifa being able to appropriately regulate this important area.\u201d Chelsea said that in 16 of the 27 breaches of article 19 \u2013 as outlined by Fifa \u2013 they had registered the players in \u201cexactly the same way as other Premier League clubs registered players at the time\u201d. Furthermore they said that, having checked with the Premier League, they were told that \u201cno special application was required (and in fact no special application process existed)\u201d, making it \u201cperverse\u201d that they were charged in these instances. In six of the other cases, Chelsea said that the breaches were of a \u201cprocedural nature only\u201d and in the remaining five they argued against Fifa\u2019s concept of \u201cdeemed registrations\u201d. The Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has made it clear that he wants to attack the market in January. Some fans worry that signings could affect the dynamics of the team and impact on the development of academy youngsters such as Reece James, Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham. For Lampard, though, the priority is to embrace opportunity on the market and to keep pace with the big spenders at the top of the English game. \u201cEvery big team buys,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at what Manchester United have spent in recent years and Manchester City, and now Tottenham last summer and Arsenal. Our picture has changed slightly [with youngsters coming through] but we still want to improve if the opportunities are there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
