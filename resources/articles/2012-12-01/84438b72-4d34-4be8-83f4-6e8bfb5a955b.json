Two topics \u2013 both dull. Only MPs were allowed. And it's frustrating for the hacks, who are getting restless. David Cameron hasn't staged a Blair-style PM's press conference for them at No 10 all year \u2013 as distinct from synthetic events with foreign leaders, including two with the saintly Aung San Suu Kyi. He also brushed aside a pointed reference to the oversight when he dined with the same hacks at a Westminster press gallery lunch this week. Twenty minutes' worth of banter after a decent lunch, with no TV cameras present, seems to them a lighter form of accountability. How can they land a punch on him if he won't get into the ring? \u2022 What happened at the Sun, we asked yesterday. One day screaming for all involved in that prank radio call to be strung up; the next, cautioning against the follies of the \"lynch mob\". Was someone displeased by the first line taken by the paper? Hard to know without listening in, and Leveson scuppers all that. But worth pointing out that the Murdoch papers in Aus have backed the chastened DJs from the start. In an editorial, Rupe's Sunday Telegraph said: \"While the prank may have been stupid, Mel Greig and Michael Christian surely did not mean to hurt anyone.\" It then argued against further regulation: \"Inevitably this death will prompt calls for tighter media regulation \u2026 but the truth is there is no regulation that could have prevented the suicide of Ms Saldanha\". As here, there has been a review of the media \u2013 the Finkelstein review \u2013 and there's talk of regulation. The Aussie Murdoch press is agin it. Maybe the Sun just read the runes. \u2022 It's Miller's time, as the Americans say. They speak of beer; we of the culture secretary Maria Miller. Yesterday we mentioned how, as a student, she was derided in the London School of Economics' student paper as a \"glove puppet\". What else is there about her? Well, in 1984, there was great strife: ructions within the student union and inevitably an occupation on campus. And how did Miller, then Maria Lewis, emerge from this? Not well. Tories gave Philip Groves, chair of the Federation of Conservative Students, a difficult time \"and they actually censured their own member of the admin sub-committee, Maria Lewis.\" Later, however, \"sitting slightly stunned\", and \"having been deserted by nearly all of her party and called an 'ex-Tory' by deputy FCS chairman Simon Brewer,\" she was sanguine. \"That's politics, isn't it?\" she said. \u2022 Pause, here, to remember Martin Wilson, a larger than life character who died tragically in a car accident last month. There were tales to be told about the Stoke City fanatic at his funeral \u2013 and freed, perhaps, from stifling convention, humanist celebrant Donna Lear felt moved to tell them. Mourners were reminded, says the Stoke Sentinel, \"of the time Martin attacked QPR goalkeeper Simon Royce on the Britannia Stadium pitch in 2005, for which he was jailed for five months\". The attack later featured in a soccer horrors DVD. She recalled the \"trail of destruction and more than a few bloodied noses\". He was, she said: \"The most loyal and supportive bloke you could ever want to meet \u2013 unless you crossed him, that is.\" Stoke's loss. The town will be a different place. \u2022 Finally, there are good days. Richard Forrester-Paton, a writer and financial researcher, had one when, out of the blue, he was invited to tomorrow's lunch organised by the Lord Mayor of London for the King of Jordan at the Mansion House. But then there are bad days; he's had one of those, too. He's written under the name Richard Makepeace \u2013 and, having confirmed the invitation, he received the sorry news that he wouldn't be attending. \"There has been a confusion with the invitation to Richard Makepeace, former ambassador in the Middle East,\" the City of London Corporation's email said. Yet it is probably for the best, as one of the things he does is activism as part of the City of London's bete noire, Occupy. He could have made the event so very interesting. Still, better to have lost a lunch than never been lunched at all. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
