Flanked by the commanders of the army and police whose troops participated in the operation, he said: \"It is the most serious blow so far to that terrorist group.\" Raul Reyes, whose real name is Luis Edgar Devia Silva, is the first member of the secretariat of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, (Farc) to be killed in combat with Colombian government troops in the four-decade-old history of the rebel army. As spokesman and leader of the political wing of the guerrillas Reyes was believed to be first in line to take over from legendary Farc leader Manuel Marulanda. Sixteen other rebels and one solder died in the raid, Santos said. The air raid was launched after ground troops were fired on from a Farc base in Ecuadoran territory across the Putumayo River along Colombia's southern border, the minister said. Aircraft were called in and opened fire on the camp from within Colombian airspace, he said. Colombian police were then sent into Ecuadorto secure the base and await the arrival of Ecuadoran authorities. Reyes, believed to be about 60 years old, was the Farc's top negotiator during failed peace talks with the government of Andres Pastrana from 1998 to 2002, during which he led a Farc commission on a tour of several European nations. The death of Reyes came two days after the Farc unilaterally released four civilian hostages who had been held for more than six years in jungle camps. Mediators working for the liberation of those and dozens of other hostages had met with Reyes to negotiate their release. It was not immediately clear how his killing will affect any further negotiations but security analyst Alfredo Rangel said the rebels' morale will be deeply shaken. \"I would say it's a devastating blow,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
