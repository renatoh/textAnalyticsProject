South African novelists have been traversing this territory for some time, because of the very inscrutability of their country. As JM Coetzee has remarked, Kafka understood \"the obscene intimacies of power\". Damon Galgut's last novel, The Good Doctor, carried, I thought, some Kafkaesque baggage; in 2005 the book was shortlisted for the Booker prize and attracted a lot of attention. Galgut moved close to the front rank of South African writers. Just as The Good Doctor has Dr Waters, his new book, The Impostor, has a displaced, youngish white man at its centre. Again, the action takes place in the unregarded margins of the country, and a third - striking - similarity is a pivotal relationship between two men, a relationship unbalanced by the unexplained affection of one for the other. After losing his Johannesburg job due to Africanisation - a young black intern he had trained is given his post - Adam Napier arrives in a remote small town to pick up his youthful vocation as a poet. There is no background or explanation; Napier accepts his lot stoically and notes that \"disappointment is the dominant theme of his life\". Adam's dodgy developer brother, who lives with his new-age bimbo, Charmaine, in Cape Town, has lent Adam a rundown cottage in the semi-desert Karoo a few hundred miles from Cape Town. If ever there was a referent for nullity, it is the Karoo: miles of nothing; very little, apparently, going on; a stillness so profound it resounds in the ears. But this very stillness is sinister. As in a shot of an idyllic suburb in an American movie, we quickly understand that there is a weasel under the cocktail cabinet. Here Adam Napier tries unsuccessfully to pick up his pen, and catches glimpses of his furtive next-door neighbour, a man of restless energy. But when he meets someone claiming to know him from school, who greets him fervently, saying \"Nappy. I have been waiting for this moment. I knew it would come, sooner or later\", Napier has no idea who he is. Even when he identifies himself as Canning, a schoolfriend, the name rings no bells - though the long-forgotten nickname is something he doesn't wish to remember, because it sprang from a bedwetting spell at boarding school. At this point, we start to wonder who the impostor in this story is. Canning has inherited from his father, who loathed him, an enormous game farm in some nearby hills. Again, there are echoes of The Good Doctor, which features an unpleasant and domineering father. A failed businessman until his father died, Canning is now inordinately rich, if rather inept and formless. The farm is called Gondwana, after the lost continent of the southern oceans; here Canning's father was attempting to create a private fiefdom, a hedge against the new South Africa, something that wealthy whites are increasingly inclined to do. But Canning himself has other, so far unexpressed, plans for the place. Now the realities of the new South Africa begin to obtrude more obviously. Something fishy is going on, with a senior government figure a regular visitor to Gondwana, and Canning's beautiful and mysterious black wife, Baby, once a hooker, still in some way on the make. She has no discernible interest in Canning, but he claims frequently to love her passionately. Napier becomes a regular visitor to the estate, and Canning pushes Napier into Baby's company while he conducts his mysterious business dealings. Napier becomes obsessed with Baby and, rather predictably, they have an affair. At this point, the book begins to acquire elements of the thriller. Napier's affair with Baby is patently dangerous, as is his acquiescence in delivering a package to the mayor's house in a township. Every reader will be screaming \"it's a payoff\", but Napier seems to be blissfully unaware. Gradually we find out what is really going on; without giving away too much of the plot, Napier becomes a target and in the end the threat to his life is ingeniously resolved. Although it has become, in essence, a thriller, and a very good one, Galgut's novel also intends a report on the state of South Africa, post-Mandela. One of its themes is the frantic desire of all parties to become rich: Napier's crass, worldly-wise brother has a token absentee black man as chairman of one of his companies; Canning tells Napier that this is how business is done in South Africa, with the criminal Russian mafia and corrupt officials. The conclusion about the white man's place in this South Africa doesn't quite follow Coetzee's judgment that it is at best ambiguous and at worst irrelevant. It seems the white man is acceptable to provide the knowhow, the capital and the market for corruption. Napier discourses on the possibility of a private aesthetic as a refuge from these harsh realities: he might immerse himself in poetry, landscape and beauty. \"He shied away from history . . . It seemed almost a duty.\" Now history has caught up with him in the most brutal fashion. These ambivalent post-apartheid novels are often more interesting than the apartheid novels, in which the moral choices were fairly simplistic. The Impostor is a bleak but compelling book, set in a time of profound uncertainty. \u00b7 Justin Cartwright's latest novel is The Song Before It Is Sung (Bloomsbury).
