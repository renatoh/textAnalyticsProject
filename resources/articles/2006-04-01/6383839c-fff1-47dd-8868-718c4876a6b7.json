He will have some history on his side too, as his trainer Barry Hills completed the Craven-Guineas double with Haafhd as recently as 2004. Haafhd had four outings and two wins as a juvenile before taking the Craven, and Killybegs' record is now identical. Backers who follow trends will be finding their way to totesport this morning to take their offer of 20-1 (from 50-1) for the Guineas. Where the pattern breaks down is that Haafhd was partnered by Richard Hills, though his twin brother, Michael, is a pretty fair approximation. \"I said to Michael before the race that I wasn't sure if he would stay,\" Hills said, \"but he didn't seem to be stopping at the end and if they had gone another 100 yards he would have won by even further. \"He's a different sort of horse to Haafhd, but he is improving all the time and there's no doubt that he's done really well from two to three.\" Metropolitan Man, the second horse home yesterday, may yet join Killybegs in the Guineas field, though David Simcock, his trainer, suggested that \"the Heron Stakes may be a more realistic race for him\". Gin Jockey, who set the early pace and stayed on into third, is likely to go to a Group Three in Germany next month. Atlantic Waves, the subject of support for the Derby in recent days, was a narrow winner of the Fielden Stakes, which produced an exceptional finish with five horses covered by less than a length. His odds for the Derby were unchanged with totesport afterwards at 14-1, though that surely has as much to do with previous liabilities as any evidence of Classic-winning ability in yesterday's race. Olympian Odyssey, who lost out by a short-head, is also 14-1 (from 40-1). Ron Cox's tip of the day Into The Shadows, 3.55, Ayr This versatile mare has her first outing over hurdles since a most creditable 4l third behind Desert Quest and Briareus at Doncaster in December, but she has looked an improved performer in two recent Flat runs. Flattered by a heavy-ground win at Southwell, she followed up as sixth behind Frank Sonata last week at Nottingham and she is clearly in fine trim for this return to jumping."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
