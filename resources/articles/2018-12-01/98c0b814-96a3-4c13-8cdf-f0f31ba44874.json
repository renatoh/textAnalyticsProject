Joining the new manager and erstwhile Blues Tinkerman, Claudio Ranieri, in making his return will be Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle, the German international who spent 18 months at Stamford Bridge and is now a key figure as the Cottagers seek to reverse their awful start to the season. Dressed as if he is heading for a reception at the Winter Palace, in black overcoat and matching turtleneck, the 28-year-old German cuts a suave, svelte figure as he takes his seat in a draughty room at the back of Craven Cottage. He has a smile on his face, too, the relief clear after Fulham claimed their second victory of the season last Saturday against Southampton. \u201cIt was a huge win for us,\u201d Sch\u00fcrrle says of the 3-2 home triumph. \u201cYou can imagine the feeling coming off this long streak of not winning. Even if you are losing every game it is so important to bounce back and get that win, to get that little bit of confidence and get that smile on your face. It was huge for us and it will just help us if we continue to work like this.\u201d The Saints match was Ranieri\u2019s first in charge and there was a notable absence of \u201cdilly-ding\u201d style banter from the Italian before and after the match. Sch\u00fcrrle confirms that things have been serious on the training ground, too. \u201cIn the first days it was a little bit more strict and more serious, which is what your need, because he wants everybody to get the way he wants to play,\u201d he says. \u201cWe watched a lot of video and trained a lot tactically on shape, trying to suck in his philosophy.\u201d Much of that philosophy, according to Sch\u00fcrrle, has been around making the team more effective at the back. That is hardly surprising given Fulham\u2019s awful defensive statistics \u2013 bottom of the league with the most goals conceded at 33 \u2013 25 of which have come from open play \u2013 and allowing an average of 16.5 shots per game. \u201cHis main focus was being tactically and defensively more stable, being in a block, being compact and basically harder to beat,\u201d Sch\u00fcrrle says. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to stay in the game a bit longer and try to pull that little bit of luck on our side. That is what we had on the weekend.\u201d The obvious question that follows is; if Fulham are concentrating on defending now, what were they doing before? \u201cThat is the funny thing,\u201d Sch\u00fcrrle says. \u201cWith Slavisa Jokanovic we thought the same as well, we wanted to stay long in the game, be compact, be defensive. Against Liverpool we did it really well. \u201cEverybody was working together defensively, like eight, nine players behind the ball always. Then we still lose. But you change manager and you get that bit of luck that we had against Southampton. Football is crazy sometimes.\u201d This last observation is something Sch\u00fcrrle recognises well. The forward\u2019s career has gone fast and slow and sometimes both speeds at the same time. After making his breakthrough at Mainz at the turn of the decade, Sch\u00fcrrle was snapped up by Bayer Leverkusen after half a dozen Bundesliga appearances. Two seasons later, in 2013, Chelsea paid \u00a318m for the then 22-year-old, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s first signing in his second spell with the club. A year later, Sch\u00fcrrle would also become a world champion in Brazil yet his time at Chelsea is generally remembered as something of a missed opportunity. From Sch\u00fcrrle\u2019s point of view, his time there can be broken down into two distinct periods, before and after the World Cup. \u201cIn my first year I was really happy with the role I had, I started half the games or a little bit more. I had quite good stats, I had goals, important goals for the team,\u201d he says. \u201cI had that confidence from the manager too. I knew he wanted a lot from me but I know I could handle it. After the World Cup, Jos\u00e9 came to me directly and said: \u2018OK, this is the year, you\u2019ll start the first game\u2019 \u2013 he told me this the first day I got back. But the second year, it was just very difficult.\u201d Sch\u00fcrrle attributes this change to exhaustion generally, and Polish chicken more specifically. He recognises the difficulties currently afflicting other Premier League players who are trying to get back to their best levels after a World Cup summer. But it was an untimely meal while on duty with Germany in October 2014 that, he says, really knocked the stuffing out of him. \u201cIt was an away game, I think in Poland,\u201d he says. \u201cI ate some chicken and had really bad salmonella. I was out for maybe three weeks and we didn\u2019t know what it was for a week. \u201cYou see how skinny I am so to lose three, four, five kilos it took me a really long time to get the strength back. I never really got the chance to prove myself being back to 100%. That was when I got the opportunity to go back to Germany and [Mourinho] let me go. I\u2019ve never eaten chicken since.\u201d Sch\u00fcrrle left Chelsea for Wolfsburg for \u20ac30m. No loan, he was just gone, though Mourinho made sure he received a title winners\u2019 medal at the end of the season. A successful 18 months followed, six of them in the company of his fellow Stamford Bridge refugee Kevin De Bruyne. That earned another, even bigger move, when Sch\u00fcrrle became Borussia Dortmund\u2019s record signing. But what came next was perhaps the most baffling and certainly most disappointing spell of Sch\u00fcrrle\u2019s career. He scored three goals in two seasons and became the subject of derision from the Yellow Wall. \u201cWe\u2019ll drink until Sch\u00fcrrle scores,\u201d went one chant. Fulham provided an escape this summer and Sch\u00fcrrle snapped it up, signing on at Craven Cottage for two years on loan. His form has been better than the team\u2019s to this point, with five league goals, including one in that win at Southampton, a definitive finish to a superlative Ryan Sessegnon cross. After being the prodigy and the prospect, the champion and the flop, Sch\u00fcrrle now finds himself in the role of senior pro, his job to help \u2013 and support \u2013 youngsters such as Sessegnon as Fulham continue their battle against the drop. \u201cIt\u2019s different for me, and it\u2019s something I need to get used to as well,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel it\u2019s my duty to get to the young players, tell them what\u2019s out there. Ryan, he\u2019s a guy that really wants to know things. Hopefully, I can help him get the right mentality as I\u2019ve been around a lot of years, I\u2019ve seen a lot of things.\u201d You can certainly say that again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
