With anticipation high ahead of the visit of Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, Steaua owner Gigi Becali had commissioned a \u201ctifo\u201d at the Arena Nationala in Bucharest to mark 30 years since their victory in the 1986 European Cup final. However, when the huge mosaic was unveiled just before kick off, it was revealed to say \u201cDoar Dinamo Bucuresti\u201d (Only Dinamo Bucharest). According to reports in Romania, the display had been organised by a group of Dinamo fans who posed as professionals offering to help prepare the display before the match. The evening went from bad to worse for Steaua, who suffered the heaviest home defeat in their history after a hat-trick from Sergio Ag\u00fcero set up a 5-0 win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
