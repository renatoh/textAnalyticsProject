This one knocks it skyward. Together with producer-to-the-stars Danger Mouse and London hip-hop producer Inflo, the British-Ugandan 32-year-old has broadened his territory to stretch from Donny Hathaway-style melancholy soul through to Rolling Stones-y gospel rock, psychedelic soul and breakbeat. There are strings and harps, samples of civil rights campaigners, Hendrix-type frazzled guitars and Burt Bacharach-type orchestrations. The dreamlike, revelatory quality is reminiscent of Marvin Gaye\u2019s What\u2019s Going On and Primal Scream\u2019s Screamadelica. Unusually, in these streaming-led times, Kiwanuka is a contemplative song cycle intended to be listened to in one extended sitting, which he says is \u201ca reaction against this fast-paced, throwaway, machine-led world\u201d. It sounds timeless and contemporary; the instrumental interludes and the stylistic and tempo shifts all hang together because of his warm, sincere vocals and fantastic songwriting. At the core is Kiwanuka\u2019s inner battle between anxiety, self-doubt, spirituality and wisdom, which is then set against racism and rueful glances at the state of the world. Thus, killer opener You Ain\u2019t the Problem is both an encouraging nudge to himself and a sharp put-down of attitudes towards immigration: \u201cIf you don\u2019t belong, you\u2019re not the problem.\u201d Hero compares the murder of 60s activist Fred Hampton with recent US police shootings (\u201con the news again, I guess they killed another\u201d), also referenced in the insistent Rolling (\u201cNo tears for the young, a bullet if you\u2019re wrong\u201d). Piano Joint (This Kind of Love) and Hard to Say Goodbye are beautifully pensive and Final Days ponders nuclear apocalypse. But for all its melancholy, Kiwanuka is never downbeat. There are moments \u2013 such as the \u201cTime is the healer\u201d gospel choir in I\u2019ve Been Dazed, or hopeful closer Light \u2013 when positivity bursts through with such dazzling effect you want to cheer. Kiwanuka is a bold, expansive, heartfelt, sublime album. He\u2019s snuck in at the final whistle, but surely this is among the decade\u2019s best."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
