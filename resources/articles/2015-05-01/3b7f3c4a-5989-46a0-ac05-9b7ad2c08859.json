Waltham Forest council has been piloting the scheme in five primary schools with large Muslim intakes. The questionnaire, circulated among year 6 pupils, asks how much they trust the police and people from another race or religion. They are also asked whether they agree that it is acceptable to marry someone from outside their race or religion and whether women are just as good as men at work. Another question asks if the pupils believe their religion is the only correct one. About 22% of the population in Waltham Forest, one of the most deprived local authorities in England, are Muslim. The programme has been funded with a \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3360,000) grant from an EU fund \u2013 the Radicalisation Leading to Terrorism Programme \u2013 designed to \u201cidentify the initial seeds of radicalisation with children of primary school age\u201d. But some parents have complained they were not consulted about the surveys. One parent of an 11-year-old boy at Buxton primary school in Leytonstone, who was asked to complete the questionnaire, said: \u201cThis is why we need to get involved with this, otherwise \u2018monitoring\u2019 like this goes unchecked and without vetting. No letter was sent home explaining this and I found out just talking to my son.\u201d Other parents expressed outrage on Twitter. \u201cThis is shockingly Orwellian,\u201d one said. \u201cOur kids don\u2019t stand a chance. Guessing there\u2019s going to be a big jump in home schooling.\u201d A council spokeswoman said concerns had been raised about the survey, especially as pupils had been asked to put their name and other identifying details on the forms. Because the surveys were supposed to have been anonymous, all of those carried out so far may be destroyed. The programme, known as Brit \u2013 Building Resilience Through Integration &amp; Trust \u2013 is targeted at nine- to 11-year-olds and involves lesson plans and workbooks about identity and belonging. The charity Family Action is delivering the programme to schools. Among other questions in the survey, children are asked if they agree or disagree with a series of statements including \u201cGod has a purpose for me\u201d and \u201cIf a student was making fun of my race or religion I would try to make them stop even if it meant hurting them.\u201d They are also asked to tick three boxes with which they identify, choosing from British, Muslim, student, artist, athlete, Christian and young. A joint statement issued by the school\u2019s executive headteacher Kath Wheeler and chair of governors Tom Williams apologised for any distress caused and said that an internal investigation had been launched. \u201cWhen we agreed to run the Brit project on behalf of Waltham Forest Council, we were not made aware that this questionnaire would be included. If we had, current procedures would have identified concerns from the outset as this involved potentially identifiable and sensitive information.\u201d The surveys had been sent to a junior member of staff at the school and had not been seen by the senior leadership, according to the statement. \u201cThe local authority has confirmed their intention was to anonymise and then destroy the questionnaires,\u201d it said. \u201cDespite this we will not be taking part in this method of evaluation now or in the future.\u201d The Islamic Human Rights Commission has urged parents to boycott the questionnaire. Its chairman, Massoud Shadjareh, said it had been designed to target and profile Muslim children. \u201cAt this young age, we should be thinking about nurturing and developing our children, not compartmentalising them. I think the questionnaire has clearly been devised by people who haven\u2019t got a clue about radicalisation. \u201cSome of the questions are just plain ridiculous. It\u2019s also clearly racist and Islamophobic \u2013 there would be uproar if they mentioned the word \u2018Jew\u2019 or \u2018black\u2019 in the identity question.\u201d Local councillors Mark Rusling and Liaquat Ali said: \u201cThe Brit project is a council programme that works with primary school pupils and their families to develop community cohesion. We\u2019re glad this has sparked a debate, as our aim is to encourage people to talk about the importance of cohesion at all ages.\u201d Bill Bolloten, an independent education consultant, expressed concern. \u201cSome Muslim parents have been saying on Twitter that they will tell their children not to answer any questions at all. It\u2019s important that schools do explore pupils\u2019 multiple identities, but this project is tainted by the desire to spot the signs of extremism in primary school children.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
