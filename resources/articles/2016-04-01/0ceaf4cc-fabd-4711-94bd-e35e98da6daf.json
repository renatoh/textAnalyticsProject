I\u2019ll keep doing that if it means I\u2019m saving my legs \u2013 and goals \u2013 for games.\u201d The England striker\u2019s 20th and 21st goals of the season not only saw off Sam Allardyce\u2019s team but have left Leicester with a seven-point lead at the top of the table. A top-four place is assured and with only five games to go the title is almost within their grasp. Considering the side, then under Nigel Pearson, spent most of last season at the bottom of the table before a near\u2011miraculous escape from relegation, their position seems almost surreal. Even more remarkably, Vardy maintains that laughter has proved a prime force in propelling them up the Premier League ladder. \u201cWe\u2019re always laughing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn training we\u2019re always having a laugh and a joke. That\u2019s just how we are, everyone\u2019s relaxed \u2013 and the gaffer wants it to be like that. The good thing about this squad is we\u2019re tight-knit. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve been from day one.\u201d Certain managers, British managers in particular, used to be very big on camaraderie but it is has gone out of fashion a little. The new breed of Euro technocrat coaches prefer to believe in tactical acumen and statistical analysis while suspecting \u201ccamaraderie\u201d may be a euphemism for alcohol-fuelled boys\u2019 nights out. Ranieri, though, refuses to underestimate the importance of the sheer chemistry it can provoke. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a secret to us,\u201d Danny Drinkwater said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we\u2019re a bunch of lads that get along. We\u2019re all willing to work hard for each other on the pitch. It shows by how well we graft out results. If stuff\u2019s not going well, we still manage to win games.\u201d Leicester\u2019s players seem remarkably diligent \u2013 not to mention effective \u2013 when it comes to self policing. \u201cWes Morgan\u2019s a great skipper,\u201d Drinkwater said. \u201cIf a big header or a big tackle\u2019s needed, he\u2019s going to make it but we all tend to talk and fire each other up. It\u2019s not just down to Wes; we\u2019ve got a few players who like doing that.\u201d Drinkwater\u2019s powerful bond with Vardy has resulted in a formidable, apparently telepathic, understanding on the pitch. \u201cDrinky knows exactly where I\u2019m going to be,\u201d said Vardy, whose first goal on Sunday came after his collection of the midfielder\u2019s long ball over the top of Sunderland\u2019s defence. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to look most of the time. As long as I know the rough area where it\u2019s going to go, I\u2019ll be on my bike and chasing the ball down.\u201d Drinkwater did not disagree. \u201cThe majority of time you don\u2019t need to look for Jamie,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just know he\u2019s going to be on the move and that, with his pace, if the pass is right, it\u2019s going to cause defenders problem. It works, it scores us goals, so why stop?\u201d This ostensibly simple, undeniably direct, formula has seen several opponents turn a little sniffy. Even a manager as pragmatic as Allardyce talked about Leicester being \u201cunique in that they don\u2019t have to be pretty\u201d before he suggested that fans of bigger clubs would complain about them playing \u201cnot the right type of football\u201d. Privately Sunderland\u2019s manager must have been impressed by the way Ranieri\u2019s streetwise players have mastered the gamesmanship-suffused ploys that proved such a feature of Allardyce\u2019s old Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers teams. Leicester, for instance, excel at the dark art of the tactical foul, namely conceding free\u2011kicks in areas where they can reset their shape before opponents attack again, and timewasting. Going forward, Ranieiri\u2019s team are very good at drawing opponents into challenges in areas where it might suit Riyad Mahrez and friends to take a set-piece. As befits a vastly experienced Italian coach, the charming, softly spoken, avuncular Ranieri has clearly passed on some valuable tips between all the laughter and pizza consumption. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to learn new things from the manager,\u201d Drinkwater said. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant. It\u2019s showing in our performances, where we are in the league. But Claudio Ranieri\u2019s a big name in football.\u201d Not that Drinkwater and company have forgotten or are prepared to overlook Pearson\u2019s contribution to Leicester\u2019s ascent. \u201cThe momentum obviously carried on from last season,\u201d he said. \u201cCredit to the old gaffer for starting that off. Both managers, I think, deserve credit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
