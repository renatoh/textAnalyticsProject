When the Hull manager was told of the approach by his chairman Adam Pearson, Taylor immediately turned them down, although he insisted he would have \"run to Reading\" had he been out of work. However, less than 12 months into his contract at the KC Stadium, Taylor believed it wrong to consider breaking his commitment to his current club. \"I've got a lot of time for Reading and I like their chairman John Madejski, having watched a lot of games at his club while I was manager at Brighton,\" said Taylor. \"Another time and I would have grabbed the chance of going there; someone's heading for a very, very good job. But I've only been at Hull since October 11 and I can't go chopping and changing jobs. It was not a difficult decision to make and I did so as soon as I was approached. \"I get on very well with Adam Pearson and I thought I'd put a stop to it straight away so as to be fair with everyone. I've signed 13 players since I've been here and I want to see it through.\" Taylor is understood only to have featured on Madejski's short list of possible candidates for the job and not to have been their primary target. Though Tony Adams and Glenn Hoddle, the recently sacked Spurs manager who lives near Reading's M4 corridor stadium, have been linked with the job, Steve Coppell is another who is believed to interest Madejski. Sunderland have agreed an undisclosed fee with Watford for the 23-year-old striker Tommy Smith, believed to be in the region of \u00a3250,000. The former England Under-21 forward has been training with Sunderland for the past two weeks in an attempt to kick-start his career after refusing to sign a new contract. The signing of Smith may re-ignite feelings of optimism among the Wearsiders' faithful that the gap left by the depature of Kevin Phillips may be filled. When Phillips was signed from Watford by Peter Reid in 1997 the young striker arrived at a club in need of some fresh impetus amid a stalling league campaign. Phillips proceeded to break Brian Clough's post-war scoring record with 35 goals in his first season, netting in nine successive home matches. Football League chairmen will today vote on a revolutionary proposal that would force clubs to publish the amount they spend each year on agent's fees. The initiative will be put to the ballot at an extraordinary general meeting of the League at Oxford United's Kassam Stadium."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
