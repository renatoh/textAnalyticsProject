It was the only national daily broadsheet to show any significant rise in circulation month on month with the Times, Guardian, Sun and Daily Mirror all registering declines - although the Telegraph did register a slight increase. The Independent is also the only daily broadsheet not to have lost readers year on year, although circulation compared with last November is up by just 0.17%. The newspaper has enjoyed a strong boost to its circulation since launching a tabloid version designed to appeal to commuters on September 30. But it now faces stiffer competition after the Times followed suit. The launch of the Times tabloid on November 26 came too late to affect last month's Audit Bureau of Circulation figures, but sales are believed to have risen by about 20,000 copies a day. They are likely to be boosted further after the print run for the tabloid edition doubled. The Times' circulation fell 8.59% year on year to 622,102 in November, more than 10,000 down on the previous month's figure and the biggest drop in percentage terms of all the national newspapers. Rupert Murdoch personally endorsed the move to a tabloid edition, saying it had been made possible by the Independent's move. The new figures also show Andrew Neil's the Business has tripled its circulation thanks to a new strategy of giving away copies with the Mail on Sunday in upmarket areas as well as in hotels and airports. The Sunday newspaper's circulation reached 272,411 last month compared with just 90,705 in November 2002, and the paper said it was in talks to extend its readership further with deals in the US and India. \"We are confident the multichannel distribution strategy we have adopted is working and that we can build on this further to more than double our circulation over the next 12 months,\" said the Business managing director Paul Woolfenden. \"We are now in the process of conducting a comprehensive readership analysis to thoroughly examine the demographics and profile of our audience that will help make advertising purchasing decisions easier.\" The Financial Times is perilously close to the 100,000 circulation mark in the UK. When giveaways are stripped out, figures show that it sold just 106,118 copies in the UK and republic of Ireland. But overseas sales now account for the bulk of its circulation with an international front, 434,321 last month. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
