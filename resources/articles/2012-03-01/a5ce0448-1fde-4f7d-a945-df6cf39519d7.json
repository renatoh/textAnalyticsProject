But if it does navigate his route to re-election, who will be the other passengers? Could one be Brian Coleman, chair of the capital's fire authority? One hopes so. For only Brian, having been wined and dined by key equipment suppliers AssetCo \u2013 nice dinners, a sumptuous hamper \u2013 and leading the authority that then awarded AssetCo a 20-year, multimillion pound contract, would unilaterally move to censor public criticism of the company. At last week's meeting of the fire authority, an activist sought to raise AssetCo's links with the United Arab Emirates military, whose men did such sterling work last year head-cracking on behalf of the Bahraini authorities. How does that reflect \"on a proud humanitarian organisation like the London Fire Brigade\", was the question to which Sabby Sagall sought an answer? None came, because chairman Brian ruled the question out of order. We don't do foreign policy, he said. He does lunch; supper occasionally. \u2022 Yes the AssetCo deal to supply the brigade with 500 vehicles and 50,000 pieces of equipment is an undoubted success. Never mind the fire authority's own monitoring report which speaks of \"performance shortfalls in the service delivered by AssetCo under the contract\" and money worries which have \"caused the diversion of AssetCo's management focus from the normal business activities of delivering the service\". There are some worries from the Fire Brigades Union about identified shortcomings such as the lack of availability of aerial appliances. But not to worry. Everything will be fine so long as all of the fires and all of the rescuing takes place on the ground. \u2022 More weekend reports about Labour leader Ed and the sequence of events that saw him arrive at a Hull City football match in a Rolls-Royce, having cried off from a community event citing illness. It's alleged that his host donated \u00a3100,000 to the party. So, Ed made his choice on that occasion. But he was absent this weekend at the Paris meeting thrown by socialist talisman Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to synchronise the European left's fist shaking at its bete noire, the German chancellor Angela Merkel. German, Italian and Belgian party bigwigs were there. Why no Ed? \"Hollande's clearly only interested in those who might be in power during his presidency,\" explained a parti socialiste hard heart. That's gotta hurt. \u2022 And as Rowan Williams plots his new life, a message from Nigeria. \"Rowan Williams took over the leadership of the Anglican Communion in 2002 when it was a happy family. Unfortunately, he is leaving behind a communion in tatters: highly polarised, bitterly factionalised, with issues of revisionist interpretation of the Holy Scriptures and human sexuality as stumbling blocks to oneness, evangelism and mission all around the Anglican world.\" That's archbishop Nicholas Okoh. No whip-round donation from him then. \u2022 Finally, as John Bercow, the Speaker, moves to stop binge drinking in the Strangers' bar and a repetition of the headbutt incident involving MP Eric Joyce, some fear an over-reaction. What's new here, asks one Commons veteran. \"It was said that the exit sign should be at shin height because so many people were crawling out of there on their hands and knees.\" Tradition too, of the occasional atrocity, one of which \u2013 from the 1940s \u2013 is recalled by the columnist \"John Gulliver\" in the Camden New Journal. Many years ago, he went to see John Platts-Mills, the urbane barrister and Labour MP for Finsbury from 1945 to 1950, who boxed as a heavyweight while a student. \"I was standing behind Willie Gallacher, a Communist MP, at the bar when a Tory picked on the little man,\" Platts-Mills remembered. \"I couldn't stand any form of bullying, especially to a little man like Gallacher, so I just knocked the Tory to the ground.\" The honourable member lay unconscious for a while. There were no repercussions. Platts-Mills died in 2001 aged 95, having defended the Kray twins and at least one of the Great Train Robbers. He would have had a kind word for Eric Joyce, one might think. Twitter@: hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
