The EEF called on ministers on Monday to come up with a long-term industrial strategy that would provide the same \"relentless and clear-sighted\" approach to expanding the economy that has been devoted to deficit reduction. Terry Scuoler, the EEF's chief executive, said: \"We all know that we need stronger growth built on firm foundations, but the economy and rebalancing have hit the buffers. We will only get back on track if the government demonstrates the same clarity and single-mindedness on growth that it has done on reducing the deficit. \"Business is seeking certainty to invest, but too often it is left with the impression that government is responding to events, rather than leading on growth.\" The EEF urged the creation of a cabinet committee for growth, jointly chaired by the prime minister and deputy prime minister, and for progress to be assessed against a small number of measurable benchmarks managed by the National Audit Office. Publishing The Route to Growth, the EEF identified 10 areas that needed action, including support for business through the tax system, better access to finance, reforms of energy pricing, cutting red tape, investing in modern infrastructure, greater banking competition, a new approach to public procurement, and the development of a well-resourced skills system. The business organisation said recovery and progress towards a rebalancing of the economy towards investment and exports had stalled in 2011. While accepting the economic environment had been affected by the debt crisis in the eurozone, the EEF said Britain's performance had been more sluggish than other developed countries, including some that are part of the single currency. It added that the government's plan for growth lacked the clarity and consistency of its programme of tax increases and spending cuts designed to reduce public borrowing. \"Despite positive measures for growth, the programme has lacked visibility. In contrast to the fiscal mandate, it fell short of communicating an unambiguous message on the type of growth our economy needed to rebalance. Nor did it offer a clear plan to address the barriers in the business environment \u2013 from access to finance and tax, to regulation and skills shortages \u2013 that stand in the way of the private sector delivering it. \"Furthermore, government actions on growth are not wrapped in credible accountability structures. Progress reports on departmental websites contrast with the rigour applied to the fiscal mandate, with the external review of the Office for Budget Responsibility.\" The report said that while there would be times when the government should aim to support individual technologies, a modern industrial strategy should focus on measures to help the widest number of companies grow by investing and exporting. The EEF said ministers should have four ambitions: more companies bringing products and services to market; a lower cost of doing business; more globally focused companies expanding in the UK; and a more productive and flexible labour market. Scuoler said: \"Clearly we need measures to get growing now and priorities should include encouraging business investment, increasing access to finance, reducing energy prices and rebuilding infrastructure. But these need to be part of an overall industrial strategy for growth and rebalancing our economy and not a series of unco-ordinated initiatives.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
