Robinson will also leave her Westminster and assembly seats early this week as the DUP punishes her for the furore over her toyboy lover and the \u00a350,000 loan she secured for him. Her husband, Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland's first minister, also came under further pressure tonight in his fight to maintain his position and remain leader of the DUP. The East Belfast MP has one week to turn his fortunes around as he faces allegations that he failed to report the loan given to his wife, which is a breach of the ministerial code. The Free Presbyterian church founded by his predecessor, the Rev Ian Paisley, and which is inextricably linked to the DUP, dealt a blow to Peter Robinson today when a senior minister and close confidant of Paisley, the Rev David McIlveen, called on the first minister to step down. \"I do believe that his position is becoming increasingly untenable,\" McIlveen said. \"He has a major problem with regard to solving his own family difficulties and I personally cannot take the view that a person's private life does not affect their public life.\" Peter Robinson has asked the office of the first and deputy first minister to appoint an independent lawyer who will examine his role in the loan scandal. The DUP repeated this weekend that he did not act improperly and knew nothing about his wife's financial dealings on behalf of her teenage lover. In a signal that the British government may be preparing for a post-Robinson DUP leadership, the Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, insisted that the \"devolution process is bigger than one man\". The DUP will start to decide on Peter Robinson's future on Monday when the first minister meets the party's officers in Belfast. However, the party's assembly members will make the ultimate decision whether he remains as DUP leader, and also as first minister. Party sources are already suggesting a new team to lead the DUP consisting of finance minister Sammy Wilson as first minister and Fermanagh/South Tyrone assembly member Arlene Foster as the party's leader. British government sources said they hoped that, whoever led the DUP, the party would start to negotiate with Sinn Fein towards devolving policing and justice powers. If the DUP resists, Sinn Fein could use the nomination of a new first minister, in the event of Peter Robinson's departure, to decline to nominate Martin McGuinness as deputy leader. That event would precipitate an election. \u25a0"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
