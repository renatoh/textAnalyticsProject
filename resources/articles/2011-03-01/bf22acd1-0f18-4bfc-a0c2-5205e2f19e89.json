What is unclear is the motives of some, other than the removal of Gaddafi. \"As the opposition move westwards across Libya it is crucial that we better understand who they are and their wider ambitions\", Murphy will say. Due to speak at the launch of a review of Labour's defence policy, he will say Britain must forge new defence partnerships and strengthen multilateral institutions. The armed forces were being asked to do more and more while they were being provided with less and less. \"The government's short-term defence review did not survive its first contact with world events,\" Murphy plans to say. The coalition government's strategic defence and security review, agreed last autumn, has been widely criticised for being dictated by the Treasury's demands for spending cuts rather than providing a coherent shape to the armed forces. The MoD faces an immediate deficit of \u00a31bn. Plans to scrap RAF Tornado jets will be more difficult now that they have played a prominent role in Britain's, albeit limited, military operations against Libya, defence officials admit. \"Internal oppression has been revealed to be one of the biggest security threats we face \u2026 In the past we confused a strong government with a stable state, whereas in fact strong unelected government often means a weak state,\" Murphy will also warn in a speech to Progress, a New Labour pressure group. \"Power without authority means that authoritarian governments act in a way that may necessitate international response,\" he will say. \"In Afghanistan the indispensable political settlement inside the country is dependent on the political settlement outside,\" Murphy will say, adding that, in Libya, it was vital the coalition had support from the Arab League for the no-fly zone, and that Arab countries had an important part to play in diplomatic efforts to determine Libya's long-term political future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
