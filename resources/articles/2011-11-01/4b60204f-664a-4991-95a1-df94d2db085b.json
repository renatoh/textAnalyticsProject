Emergency workers attending the scene said it was \"the worst road traffic collision anyone can remember\". \"There must have been 200 metres-worth of fire \u2013 plumes of smoke were going up and everything was red,\" said Bev Davis, who heard the explosions from her home close to the motorway. At least 34 vehicles, including a number of lorries, were involved in the crash close to junction 25 of the M5's northbound carriageway. Drivers reported that patchy fog suddenly made driving conditions extremely difficult. A teacher caught up in the crash described how he carried a baby to safety amid the chaos. Tom Hamill, 25, said shortly after he joined the motorway he hit a \"wall of fog like emulsion paint\" and suddenly saw a jackknifed lorry loom into view. He was in a Renault Megane with his girlfriend, Katherine Lane, 24, and father George Hamill, 56. \"Conditions as we got on the M5 were relatively clear. But within 100 metres there was a white wall of fog \u2013 the worst fog I have ever seen, it was horrific. I slowed down and veered towards the central reservation, which is what probably saved our lives. The fog lifted and around us was utter carnage. \"We managed to stop because we had just joined the motorway and were not going too fast. But a car came by within seconds at about 70mph and went straight into the lorry. We sat there and heard the thud of cars, one after another, hitting each other and thought we would be next. We could hear people screaming in their cars.\" Hamill described seeing a \"massive fire\" and watching a lorry explode. \"It appears it was full of deodorants and cans,\" he said. \"And then another lorry hit that one and both caught fire as the flames spread. \"One car was doing 60-70mph when it went into the back of a lorry that had jackknifed across the carriageway. On the other side of the carriageway there was debris flying back into people from passing vehicles. People were trapped in their vehicles and they were screaming. I heard people screaming and children crying. It was very stressful. There was also fuel which had spilled on to the road surface, which was exploding.\" He said that he stopped his girlfriend getting out to help because it would have meant certain death. In an incident that probably saved their lives, two other lorries jacknifed behind them, creating what was effectively a safe area. This enabled the three to leave the car and go to the aid of a shocked mother with a young baby. As they left among burning vehicles and others still hitting each other, a potentially lethal piece of debris shot over Hamill's head as he was carrying the baby. He later reunited the baby with its mother. Hamill said he was still able to see his father's Megane car on TV news reports. It was still at the scene and largely intact. \"We were incredibly lucky. The woman who gave her child, her car was wiped out. It was utter carnage.\" Sam Jones, 22, who was travelling with his 19-year-old sister came to a halt yards before a burning lorry. \"One man said there was someone trapped inside a blue taxi which had run straight into the back of a lorry. I could see the taxi. It had completely crumpled. I couldn't tell if there was anyone inside. It was incredible how quickly everything caught fire.\" Some local people said that smoke from fireworks at the rugby club next to the motorway might have contributed to the poor visibility. \"You could tell there was a lot of smoke because sometimes the fireworks were obscured and it was coming this way,\" Birch said. \"I remember thinking: 'I hope the smoke doesn't cause a problem for the motorway.' Perhaps it did, we don't know. But there was certainly a huge fireworks display \u2013 15 minutes [of] full-on constant display \u2013 right beside the motorway and it was generating a lot of smoke.\" Assistant chief constable Anthony Bangham, of Avon and Somerset police, said a number of passengers were unable to escape from their burning cars. \"Most vehicles were well alight and most continued to burn for a considerable time,\" Bangham said. \"This made it very difficult to search the vehicles.\" Firefighters, who called 15 appliances to the crash scene, battled to rescue motorists from cars and lorries using hydraulic equipment. Motorists also attempted to pry open vehicle doors themselves. Dr Colin Close, medical director for Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton, said medical staff had dealt with \"nothing of this magnitude ever before\". Experts said Britain had not seen a multiple traffic accident on the scale of Friday's pile-up for 20 years. Edmund King, president of the AA, said the only comparable incident was a crash that involved 51 cars on a stretch of the M4 in Berkshire in March 1991. That crash, which happened near the town of Hungerford in heavy fog during morning rush hour, left 10 people dead and a further 25 injured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
