Alcott didn\u2019t have it all his own way during the match, battling it out to three sets with David Wagner and eventually claiming victory 6-2, 4-6, 6-2. With the conditions at Roland Garros less than perfect, Alcott fought hard to keep the pressure on Wagner and held his nerve in the last set. A win in the first ever quad wheelchair event at Wimbledon in July will put Alcott on track to match Rod Laver in winning the calendar year grand slam. With Ashleigh Barty\u2019s win hours later it was a victorious day for the Australians who the previous day celebrated together after qualifying for their first French Open singles finals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
