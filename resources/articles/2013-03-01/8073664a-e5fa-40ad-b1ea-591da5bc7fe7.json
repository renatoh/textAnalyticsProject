As Steve Bruce was quick to admit, this was an eminently forgettable match yet the league table now has an attractive look to Hull City. Courtesy of Stephen Quinn's goal, they beat Burnley to leapfrog Watford and Crystal Palace. With nine games to go, they have returned to the automatic promotion places and are on course to claim the golden ticket of a place in next season's Premier League. Should they do so, a drab night at an ice-cold Turf Moor will have served its purpose. \"It was never going to be pretty,\" Bruce said. \"It was a horrible, hard evening. I'm sure the Sky viewers were switching over to the History Channel. Certainly after 60 minutes I was ready to.\" Rather than watching history, Bruce could make it. Hull have been promoted to the top flight only once in their 109-year history. The current class moved closer to emulating the side of 2008 as, deprived of the chance to channel hop by his duties on the touchline, Bruce instead tinkered with his team and made an instant impact with his first bold move of the night. \"We thought: 'Right, we are going to put our attacking players on and try and win the match',\" he said. \"We didn't expect it to happen within 40 seconds.\" Indeed, no sooner had Robert Koren and Jay Simpson entered proceedings than they combined to great effect, the Slovenian instigating the move which ended with the former Arsenal striker teeing up Quinn to drill in the game's only goal. \"You can talk about game plans but the players are the ones who make it happen,\" added Bruce, playing down his own role. Yet this was a victory scripted from the dugout. Hull's previous three games had produced 18 goals. Bruce's problem was that 10 of them came at the wrong end. So, opting for caution, the former central defender packed his side with his own kind and, indeed, his own kin. Bruce's unconventional 3-5-1-1 formation helps account for their rise but this time he included a fourth centre-back with his son Alex shunted forward to become a makeshift holding midfielder. The perils of using the younger Bruce in a more advanced role were illustrated when the ball dropped invitingly on the volley and he ballooned his shot into the Jimmy McIlroy Stand. His father, however, could savour the greater solidity his charges displayed. \"We just wanted to make sure there was a determination about us not to concede,\" he said. It was evident in the resolve. Fluency was missing; tenacity was certainly not. And, having preserved parity in an opening hour when only Burnley's Ross Wallace, with a stinging drive that David Stockdale saved, threatened to score, Bruce made his move, sacrificing his son for the more creative Koren. \"They have done well away from home at nicking wins or nicking points,\" said Burnley's beaten manager, Sean Dyche. It has proved a profitable method. Lacking a prolific marksman, plenty of players have chipped in and Quinn contributed his third of the campaign. In contrast Burnley have the division's second-top scorer in Charlie Austin, but he is alone in finding the net in their last six games. His added-time header bounced agonisingly wide and Dyche lamented: \"The margins are so fine. We are nearly performing.\" The substitute Sam Vokes twice went close too but Burnley's play-off push has petered out while Hull capitalised on their immediate rivals' inability to win on Saturday to accelerate past them. \"We have given ourselves a wonderful chance,\" Bruce said, while delivering a warning. \"In the last eight or nine games you'll see all sorts of shenanigans.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
