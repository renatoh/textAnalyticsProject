Two will be missing but not as a result of football's downturn: Bradford City and Wolverhampton Wanderers play tomorrow afternoon - live on Sky Sports. Even now, in the midst of the most cheerless times since the human disasters of Heysel, Bradford and Hillsborough, no Football League club has gone under. How long that remains the case is anyone's guess. Although the ITV Digital affair feels as if it has been going on for decades rather than months, the clubs involved, principally in the First Division, are only at the beginning of a process of realignment. The first slice of the \u00a3178.5m that should have come through from ITV Digital was due nine days ago. The effects of its non-appearance should take longer to work themselves out, as happened with Bosman. Leicester City, for one, could do with the money immediately: they might be able to pay Nicky Summerbee and Billy McKinlay a wage for playing. As it is, Summerbee and McKinlay are volunteers - part of a trend of unlikely sacrifices. At Bury they are long used to penury but even at Gigg Lane the players have opted to buy their own boots. Downsizing is everywhere, from players to agents to chief executives. An era characterised by the vanity of Geoffrey Richmond is no more. How bad a thing can that be? Is it a sign of good times or mad that Lee Sharpe was earning \u00a31m-plus at Valley Parade? Sharpe is now visiting places like Grimsby hoping to get a contract at a mere \u00a36,000 per week, poor fella. He may soon have to volunteer as well. And yet, exorbitant as Sharpe's wages were, where all the money went is a question the fans of Bradford City are entitled to ask as the club tries to avoid following Bradford Park Avenue into oblivion. Then again, it is a question supporters everywhere should consider. After all, 14,716,162 tickets were sold for Football League games last season. It was this supposedly doomed entity's best attendance figures for 33 years. As usual this was a larger number of people than paid to watch the Premiership. Another headline the Football League could get out is that it was the most watched live sports event in Europe. That is not to ignore the miserable economic reality but it is a statistic worth remembering, just as names like Park Avenue and Accrington Stanley, Aldershot and Maidstone are. The Football League was founded in 1888 and these names stand out because they are exceptions. The first winners, Preston North End, are still going strong. \"It's been 22 years - through thin and thin,\" said David Kilpatrick, the chairman of Rochdale, yesterday when asked how long he had been on the board at Spotland. Kilpatrick's longevity gives him a sense of perspective perhaps lacking among some of the newer chairmen currently vocal about the state of the First Division. Rochdale have been in the bottom division all Kilpatrick's time and for the six years before that but they are still competing, still trading. \"The situation was absolutely horrendous then, it's much better now,\" Kilpatrick said of the day-to-day effort to survive. \"It's a bit like painting the Forth Road Bridge, you keep going. There are no millionaires on the board here but no chief executive on fancy money either. Everything is manageable, though you are always 10 minutes away from a problem.\" It has not yet been one great enough to bring closure and, while Kilpatrick said, \"There are no upbeat scenarios in terms of finance,\" he also thinks predictions of as many as 25 clubs going bankrupt are \"spin\". \"We start from a fair position in as much that we're not lumbered financing a big overdraft and we don't have major debt but, as we embark on the season, the fact is that we need it to be successful in order to break even. We only get gates of 3,000 but, if we start off badly, then those will collapse. As for others, it's difficult to call but history tells you that it's going to be one hell of a situation for someone to go out of business. Football clubs aren't like other businesses in the community; there always seems to be someone.\" In Rochdale's case this week it was Kevin Keegan. On his insistence Manchester City took no gate money from a Spotland friendly that attracted almost 10,000. Rochdale are very grateful. Kilpatrick also said that the ITV Digital debacle may not cause the expected lower division subsidence as the nature of the replacement four-year \u00a390m Sky deal curiously benefited Second and Third Division clubs at the First Division's expense. It was agreed that, if the total deal represented more than \u00a330m per annum, the First Division clubs would take 90% of that but, if less than \u00a330m, they take 60%. The deal is worth \u00a322.5m. A significant part of the First Division chairmen's fury stems from these percentages. Second and Third Division clubs never expected or budgeted for as much and so their disappointment financially and emotionally is less pronounced. Consequently it may be in the First Division that a club disappears. But those are lengthening odds - Summerbee said he has been told Leicester will have their economics under control \"within the month\". Moreover, while we are told that Summerbee has more than 500 colleagues in the same leaky boat, the Professional Footballers' Association disputes the figure and will offer a new one on Monday. It transpires that players who leave the Football League for Conference clubs, for example, are still listed as unemployed, clearly a misnomer given that more Conference clubs than ever are full-time and that two of them, rather than one, will be promoted this season for the first time. Two Third Division clubs will be relegated, therefore, following Halifax Town down. And there lies a major structural problem - recovering from exiting the league. It may take Halifax years, though at least they did sign some players this week and should be able to fulfil next Saturday's Conference opener against Telford. Doncaster Rovers play Barnet the same day, another sign that life goes on. It is not life as the big Football League and Premiership clubs know it. But for the Rochdales and Burys this has always been the life and sometimes looking from the bottom up is not as daunting as looking from the top down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
