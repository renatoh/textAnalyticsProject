He holds out two pills. Take the blue pill, he says, and you go back to a life of clock-punching drudgery where your every move is monitored. Take the red one, and you get spaceships, kung-fu and a leather-clad Carrie-Anne Moss. Take away the martial arts, and Morpheus could just as well be describing the monumental choice Americans are facing today over the future of the internet. Only it's not science fiction. Over the next few years, Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the next president will shape the internet for a generation. Down one path is a closed internet experience tightly controlled by a small handful of giant corporations. Down the other is the open internet, with all its possibilities. Who wants you to swallow the blue pill? Meet the nation's biggest telecom and cable companies, a cartel that dominates 99% of the US residential market for high-speed internet access. These firms - led by AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner - want to exploit their gatekeeper power to decide what you can do on the web. That's not what they say in their ubiquitous ads, of course. But watch their actions closely - or squint at the fine print in the terms of service - and you'll get a glimpse of their plans. These companies are lobbying furiously to kill \"network neutrality\" - the longstanding principle that prevents them from discriminating against websites or services based on their source, ownership or destination. Comcast was recently caught blocking users of file-sharing services, cutting off access to legal content - including a download of the King James Bible. Their \"network management\" is really just an attempt to undercut potential competitors in the video business, while avoiding sorely needed network upgrades. Verizon censored text messages sent by Naral Pro-Choice America to its own members. Only after the incident appeared on the front page of the New York Times did Verizon correct its \"glitch\" and let the messages go through. AT&amp;T plans to \"filter\" content to ferret out pirated material on its networks. The company - the same one seeking retroactive immunity for spying on your phone calls - would use copyright protection as a Trojan horse to inspect everything travelling over its pipes and control how audio and video are distributed on the web. An open internet looks quite different. It starts with net neutrality, which guarantees a level playing field and gives the little guy the same chance as Google to come up with the next big thing. (Remember, it wasn't Comcast or AT&amp;T that invented YouTube, blogs, eBay or almost anything else that makes the internet so great.) On an open internet, a provider's only job is to move data - not degrade, inspect or censor content. An open internet also means more competition and choices. Unfortunately, the US government has abandoned the \"open access\" requirements that once forced telecom companies to share their wires to ensure a competitive market. When it comes to broadband, most US consumers now are lucky to have two choices: the phone or the cable company. Contrast this with the dozens of providers competing for your business overseas. No wonder Americans pay far more for slower speeds than consumers in Europe and Asia. We need to open up the wireless networks, too. Mobile devices are how many of us will access the internet in the future. But US consumers are shackled with punitive, long-term contracts as new technology is kept behind walled gardens. (If you want an iPhone, your only option is to sign up with AT&amp;T.) Why can't we use any phone or software we want on all networks? The answer comes down to policy decisions - mostly bad ones. For too long, our policies have been crafted behind closed doors by high-priced lobbyists and clueless politicians. It's scandalous that we've reached this critical juncture without a truly public conversation about what the future of the internet should look like. Instead of aiding and abetting another massive giveaway to the phone and cable companies, our legislators and regulators need to get outside Washington. We need old-fashioned town meetings and online forums about the internet's future in every state, if not every congressional district. Unless you're a phone or cable company executive, it's hard to imagine anyone who opposes universal, affordable access to an open internet for everyone. Already, nearly two million people have contacted Congress and the FCC about the once-obscure issue of net neutrality. Can you think of another issue that unites MoveOn.org and the Christian Coalition, Peta and the Gun Owners of America, Amazon.com and the American Library Association? Putting an open internet on the national agenda this election year and into 2009 will require an unusual combination of dedicated politicians, high-tech companies that see beyond their own narrow interests and innovative grassroots organising online and off. And we can count on the phone and cable giants - with their limitless lobbying budgets and bulging campaign coffers - to put up a fight. But as Morpheus once said: \"I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
