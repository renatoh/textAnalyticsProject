At a price like that, you\u2019d hope the bookies have made a few quid, with all profits going to NHS Charities Together. If you were lucky enough to back it yourself, you might be of a mind to donate some or all of your winnings. Every little helps! AP McCoy speaks: The former champion jockey is robustly defending himself in the face of abuse he\u2019s getting on social media for the terrible ride the virtual him gave Don\u2019t Push It in the Champions Race.

Red Rum wins by half-a-length from Manifesto. Red Rum surprises absolutely nobody by winning the Race of Champions. A dual winner, Manifesto was second. Tiger Roll gets on the podium in third. Race of Champions: Tiger Roll and Davy Russell continue to make the running as they approach the 18th fence, with Amberleigh House in third. Monty\u2019s Pass and Mr Frisk - possibly the last winner I backed in this race back in the mid-nineties - are well placed. Monty\u2019s Pass is a faller ... Tiger Roll leads them over Beecher\u2019s Brook from L\u2019Escargot and Don\u2019t Push It ... Race of Champions: Oh dear. The 1976 winner Rag Trade is a faller at the first, with Red Rum, Aldaniti and Tiger Roll in good positions. Aldaniti falls at the third. Bob Champion is on his feet and OK. Manifesto jumps well at The Chair, while Silver Birch refuses, the lazy git ... The Race of Champions: Inspired Gaming in Manchester are the brains behind today\u2019s wheeze and as faintly ludicrous as the whole thing is, their work is certainly impressive. They\u2019re about to stage a race of Champions, pitting 40 of the best Grand National winners from the past against each other. L\u2019Escargot and Red Rum are among the favourites. And we\u2019re off: Well, not really. But ITV coverage of today\u2019s Virtual Grand National has begun, with presenter and nominative determinism\u2019s Nick Luck broadcasting live from his study, where he has a nice piano in the background. There\u2019s posh. Update: Huw has won \u00a37,000 on The Chase and at the behest of his wife, is going to spend his winnings on new bedroom furnishings and a little holiday. Well done, Huw. Coral PR man Simon Clare tweets ... It seems today\u2019s virtual Grand National has captured the imagination of a very bored British public who are desperate for some sporting entertainment. To the pre-parade ring we go ... Normally at this time of year, the ITV cameras would be in the pre-parade ring interviewing various trainers, owners and stable lads as their horses are saddled and any last-minute adjustments are made. This year, TV viewers have to forego all that pre-race pomp and ceremony because The Chase is on and won\u2019t be over until 5pm. In case you\u2019re interested, a man named Huw has just failed to identify Chloe Madeley as the daughter of TV presenter Judy Finnigan. Apart from Elizabeth Taylor, who won the Grand National on board The Pie in the 1944 movie National Velvet, a total of 30 horses have been ridden by women down the years in the Grand National. Charlotte Brew was the first to get the leg up, in 1977, when her mount Barony Forth refused at the 26th fence. Geraldine Reece became first women to complete the course, finishing in eighth and last place on board Cheers five years later. While no woman has ever ridden the winner of the Grand National, Katie Walsh became the highest place finisher when she came third on Seabass in 2012. In this year\u2019s virtual affair, there are three women taking their chance. Bryony Frost, whose father Jamie won the 1989 race on Little Polveir, rides 28-1 shot Yala Enki, Rachael Blackmore and Burrows Saint look a decent bet at 12-1 and Lisa O\u2019Neill is a long shot on Shattered Love.

Confined to barracks with too much time on his hands like the rest of us when he\u2019d much prefer to be gadding around Aintree, Chris Cook reads his racing runes. Although today\u2019s race has been pre-recorded, those privy to the result have been sworn to secrecy and punters with online betting accounts will be able to have a punt on the race, should they so desire. The odds on each horse are fixed and stakes are restricted to a maximum of a \u00a310 win or \u00a310 each way per person. Earlier this week, bookmakers announced that all profits generated will be donated to NHS Charities Together. Any punters who hit pay dirt are also invited to donate some or all of their winnings by clicking on the link above. A cynical ploy the bookmakers to generate some much-needed good PR while encouraging newbies to open new online accounts? The cynic in me says yes, but Gary Follis, of the Betting and Gaming Council, which represents all the major firms offering odds on the race, did his best to allay such fears earlier this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed a set of rules around this and there\u2019s going to be no marketing to new customers, it\u2019s only going to be promoted among the current customer base, and there\u2019s also going to be guidelines around the treatment of any new customer who signs up as a result of this,\u201d he said. \u201cLike any Grand National, there will always be new customers, though probably considerably fewer this time around, but we\u2019re looking at ways to put them into a separate database, so that they don\u2019t receive any follow-up marketing or cross-promotion of other products.\u201d 1.

Walk In The Mill (James Best) 16-1 The strict UK lockdown means that this virtual race could pull in more viewers than the actual Aintree spectacular, writes Greg Wood. And he\u2019s not even joking! Following the cancellation of the actual Grand National, originally slated to take place at Aintree today, due to the coronavirus pandemic, ITV Racing have decided to stage a computer-simulated running of the world\u2019s most famous steeplechase instead. Using Computer Generated Imagery (CGI), a field of 40 virtual horses and riders will tackle the famous fences over four-and-a-half miles, cheered on by tens of thousands of virtual racegoers and followed \u2013 in a nice touch \u2013 by a virtual ambulance which won\u2019t be a drain a NHS resources. \u201cThe simulation itself is made up of mathematical algorithms using data taken from the horses\u2019 previous performances,\u201d say the Racing Post. \u201cThe race\u2019s outcome uses a number of factors such as age, weight, form and weather conditions but also contains details such as fallers, unseated riders and collapsed fences. \u201cData on all of the 40 runners from this year\u2019s race have been added and the computer has generated odds. The three previous Virtual Grand Nationals have been strikingly accurate, with Tiger Roll completing the virtual-real life double in 2018.\u201d Greetings all and welcome to this afternoon\u2019s live coverage of what is ostensibly \u2026 well, a cartoon. Yep, the current sporting lockdown means it\u2019s come to this, but as the former National Hunt jockey Andrew Thornton said in one preview of today\u2019s virtual Grand National that I viewed yesterday: \u201cAnything\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong. As we enter our third week of sport-free house arrest in the UK, stay tuned for coverage of a race that won\u2019t so much stop a nation like the famous Melbourne Cup, but provide some much-needed amusement for an already stationary nation as its citizens remain on lockdown and in need of some more than welcome sporting distraction. The flag is due to drop at 5pm (BST) and we\u2019re reasonably hopeful there won\u2019t be a false start, but stay tuned in the meantime for what we are loosely going to term buildup. It\u2019s a bit of fun for all the family and with any profits made by bookmakers going to NHS Charities Together (more of which anon), the cause could scarcely be more worthy in the current weird climate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
