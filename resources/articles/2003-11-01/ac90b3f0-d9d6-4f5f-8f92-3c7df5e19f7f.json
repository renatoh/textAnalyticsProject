After their European calamity last season, Bayern are now experiencing a reversal of roles, heading their Champions League group but stuttering badly in the Bundesliga, where thay have slumped to fifth after losing 2-0 at Schalke 04 last Saturday. This weekend, Bayern face a formidable test against Borussia Dortmund. A win against Lyon is essential to restore self-belief as well as take a large stride towards qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League. \"Only victory will do,\" Bayern's coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said of tonight's European encounter, before looking ahead to Sunday's meeting with Dortmund. \"After those two games we will find out where we stand,\" he added. In Europe, Bayern have been motivated by memories of their Champions League humiliation last season, when they were sensationally eliminated in the first group stage. Now, they lead Group A with five points from three games after drawing 1-1 at Lyon a fortnight ago. The French champions and Anderlecht have four points apiece and Celtic three. But Hitzfeld has serious problems in midfield. They will almost certainly be without the Germany midfielder Sebastian Deisler because of the thigh injury that forced him off in the defeat by Schalke. \"He will not be fit, unless there's a miracle during the night,\" Hitzfeld admitted yesterday. Bayern's England midfielder Owen Hargreaves, struggling with a puzzling hip injury, will definitely not appear against Lyon. There are fears that he will not play again this season. Bayern believe they have yet to get the best out of their \u00a312m Holland striker Roy Makaay, who scored Bayern's goal at Lyon. The former Deportivo La Coruna player said: \"We are not playing well and we are not happy with that,\" he said. \"If we win against Lyon, calm will return to the team.\" In the Bundesliga, after 11 games, Bayern are six points behind the leaders VfB Stuttgart. \"It's a significant deficit,\" Hitzfeld conceded. \"It's important not to lose our nerves now, it's the decisive thing at a time when everyone is under pressure. That's why a victory against Lyon is of such a great significance.\" Makaay's arrival in summer was the reason Bayern decided to let Giovane Elber leave. The Brazilian joined Lyon and he will be making his first visit to the Olympic Stadium with his new team after spending six highly successful seasons with Bayern. Elber did not score in the draw in France, when Kahn made a stunning reflex save to deny the Brazilian. \"I was hoping to win at home against Bayern,\" said the striker. \"In Munich, you have to be happy with a point.\" Lyon have also had worries in the build-up for the game in Bavaria. Another Brazilian, Edmilson, together with Sidney Govou and Peguy Luyindula, were forced off in their 5-0 victory against Nice on Saturday. Govou is unlikely to play because of an ankle injury, but the other two are expected to be available tonight. Lyon's coach Paul le Guen is upbeat about tonight. \"We've come here with some expectations. We know that we are playing against the group favourites, but we want to achieve something,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
