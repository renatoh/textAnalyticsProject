The great guac-off of 2015 was not about extra charges for the dip \u2013 it was about adding an extra vegetable \u2026 quite an unnecessary one, according to people with too much time on their hands. A recipe for \u201cGreen Pea Guacamole\u201d \u2013 adapted from New York\u2019s ABC Cocina restaurant and tweeted out by the New York Times \u2013 calls for a radical notion: \u201cAdd green peas to your guacamole. Trust us,\u201d the newspaper told its 17.7 million followers. Not many people did. Some told the Times to delete its account, while others called out the publication for distributing \u201cpossibly the worst food advice ever\u201d. Some websites glommed on, suggesting there were worse things you could add to the Mexican avocado mix \u2013 ranch dressing, cream \u2013 and Twitter exploded in bad puns, with \u201cGuaca-NO-le\u201d being hardly the worst of it. But the mockamole of \u201cpea-gate\u201d quickly escalated to a bipartisan political platform. The Texas Republican party took to Twitter to say the Times had \u201cdeclared war on Texas when they suggested adding green peas to guacamole\u201d. Presidential hopeful Jeb Bush had already established his opinion on the matter (anti-pea) during a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon. On Wednesday, he stood by his platform: \u201cYou don\u2019t put peas in guacamole,\u201d he wrote. Somehow, the pea politics made their way up to the White House, as Obama revealed during a previously scheduled Twitter Q&amp;A that he prefers his guacamole the classic way \u2026 except with peppers. So the current president and the brother of his predecessor at least agree on that. In an accompanying link to a recipe for the extra-green guacamole, the Times\u2019 Melissa Clark wrote: \u201cAdding fresh English peas to what is an otherwise fairly traditional guacamole is one of those radical moves that is also completely obvious after you taste it.\u201d The recipe in question is about two years old, and originated at ABC Cocina from chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. The guacamole received significant attention in 2013, when several food critics and writers weighed in on the dish. Clark wrote about the guacamole in July 2013 for the Times\u2019s Restaurant Takeaway column. ABC Cocina told the Guardian, which published a recipe for guacamole with pomegranate seeds in 2013, that \u201cJean-Georges has decided to pass on the opportunity to comment on this issue.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
