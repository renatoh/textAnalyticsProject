Channel 4's ad campaign for the second series of the US show set in a funeral home features spoof ads for products such as embalming fluid and wound filler, done in the style of upmarket beauty and fashion brands. But a spokesman for Funeral Care, which provides around 80,000 funerals a year, said the ads were likely to provoke \"fear and horror\" in the recently bereaved. \"We welcome appropriate attempts to open this issue up to public debate and we believe Six Feet Under has been a very useful catalyst for discussion [about dealing with death and bereavement],\" he added. \"But there's a fine line between socially acceptable and unacceptable ways of conducting this debate. Our concern is for those who have suffered a bereavement and we believe many of them will find these ads distressing and provocative,\" the Funeral Care spokesman said. \"We are all for starting an intelligent debate, but this is more likely to provoke fear and horror.\" It also emerged today that two leading celebrity magazines, OK! and Closer, have refused to carry the Six Feet Under ads. The campaign will break on Channel 4 tonight and in print and on poster sites on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
