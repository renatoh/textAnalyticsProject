Keep trying, in my mind, to split us all up, in order to make sense of the way the plums get pulled 'in this ever-changing world in which we live in', to borrow from one of dear Mr McCartney's more creative if exuberantly ungrammatical phases. I used to think it was filmic. Most people just went through life, but some people went through life as if in a film: checking always to see who was watching, acting as they thought they should, rather than just as they should. I was one. I got tired of it, and there were some very bad films. Now, recently, I am tempted to split us up by our attitude to solitude. I love it, frankly. This is an advantage, of course, when, like me, you're obviously old and everyone hates you (and not even mainly because of the smells); but I think it's something of a terrific advantage for pretty much everyone, even the happy. Can you remember the first time you were, early twenties or whatever, really alone, full-weekend alone, no company but your own, nothing arranged? Did you twitch? Were you on a hot tin roof? Pacing, grimacing, playing with socks and practically sicking up furballs, running to the phone if it looked like getting warm? Or did you quietly grin, find two books and three films, lots of music by Michael Marra or Donald Fagen and a walk in the rain? I've been thinking about it while planning a little trip to Lisbon and hoping I am not simply becoming a misanthrope. Here's what I want: what I dream of. There is a little bar, just down from the Sao Jorge castle. I say 'just down'. But you curse many times, on the loopy steep winding cobbles, simply trying to find it again; I suspect they move it every few years to tick us off, but only around the corner, just to have a polite tilt at our memory, because that's what they do, the Portuguese, them with their sports jackets and their polite miniature wives, memory-shufflers all. Eventually I will be there, and also there will be coffee and beer if I should suddenly decide to want to further ruin my life, and a man with a wooden leg playing chess with his goat, and sun, and a hot squinted view (through drying garments, furling with wind, mad damp child plaid mostly) of the river, and misrecalled angles to nag me that it might not be exactly the right place I remembered, subtly different cheese and shadows and so what: but, mainly, there will be me. Is it simply odd, this? Won't I have enough time, when old(er) or dead, to be alone? I used to feel fairly sure that there was nothing too odd about me spending so much time with me, even if this was as much the result of the actions of Others, who didn't want to be insulted/let down/broken quite as often as I seemed to accidentally want to manage that, as it was my own driven choice. Touch of Macca grammar there, but you get the point. But I have been made aware, over a while, over years, that other people have, sometimes, people round. Just for it. Just to get people round. If left alone, they shout and do the sock drawer. That is a horrid rude exaggeration, and almost undoubtedly far more telling of my incipient slide into mid-forties crabdom than anything else, but of all the questions I have learned to dislike over the past few years, 'Won't you be bored?', when it's obvious I won't because I spend most of all my happy time on my own, gets me particularly twitchy. Why would I be bored, on my own? You can, as I say, divide them up. I can imagine Gordon happy on his own, but not Dave. Humphrys but not Naughtie. Nigella but not Jamie. Jane Eyre but not Bridget Jones. Jon Snow but not (of course) Rageh Omar. I love to meet people. I love it when it's rationed. But if I am seeing someone, agree to meet, in a designated place, looking forward to it with huge and happy stars, and then the plaintive call comes, 'Come here first, you'll be bored', the thing is this: I won't. I know what's in your flat. You, which is wonderful. Same doors though and table and top-floor stairs. Rather see you in the place we agreed to meet, because it's new, isn't all of life, and there I can read, and think, and look at the photos, and watch the arguments, and also I have Me for company, and the hope of a lovely evening. And if that doesn't happen, buggers itself, there's always Lisbon. euan.ferguson@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
