It's thoughtful, sincere, weighty stuff, tackling subjects from African poverty to the diamond trade without sounding preachy or schmaltzy. Nas is at his best addressing \"those who get left behind\" on Strong Will Continue, while Marley has inherited his father Bob's knack for simple phrases that hit home, notably Tribes At War's \"Everyone deserves to earn, every child deserves to learn\". An eclectic musical backdrop sounds more comfortable with reggae than acoustic guitars and pop, and Count Your Blessings' lyrics celebrating \"love and assurance, new health insurance\" jar somewhat. But tunes as strong as the eerie, haunting Patience and troubled reggae Leaders (\"They took our leaders and lynched them\") will prove difficult to deny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
