Del Olmo, who rides for the Basque team Euskaltel, was pulled out of the race on Saturday morning after he was confirmed as testing positive in the prologue time-trial at Dunkirk. The Spanish press have reported that he is the latest of a string of riders to show traces of the blood-booster erythropoietin, but this has not been confirmed by his team. Last year the death of a 12-year-old boy, knocked down by a vehicle in the race caravan on Bastille Day, led to a complete reappraisal of the way the Tour manages its thousands of vehicles and a cut in the number of cars permitted to drive the route. The incident in Colmar on Saturday, however, was entirely down to the aberrant behaviour of one individual and is unlikely to produce the same soul-searching. The car, a maroon Renault 21 driven by a man in his fifties said to be \"out of control\", overturned barriers and sent spectators flying after it sped into the finish area three quarters of an hour after Jalabert had crossed the line. Two of the injured were police and a third a member of the Tour organisation who tried to stop the man. In the end he came to a halt only when his windscreen was smashed. The man had apparently attempted to enter two hours earlier and had been refused entry because he did not have accreditation. \"The motor was screaming, the music was blaring and he was yelling out that he was God,\" said one eyewitness. The Tour organiser Jean-Marie Leblanc said the man's conduct was \"completely irrational\". The constant proximity of riders and spectators means that, as Leblanc said, the race is \"never free of the risk of such behaviour\". The biggest danger to the riders, however, is from spectators who are not deranged but merely overenthusiastic. The constant fear is that they will be knocked off their bikes by one of the crowds that surge across the roads in the mountains, as happened to the Italian Giuseppe Guerini in 1999. Apart from a pepper-throwing incident that same year, the only recent event to compare with Saturday's dates back to 1975 when Eddy Merckx was punched by a spectator on the Puy de Dome mountain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
