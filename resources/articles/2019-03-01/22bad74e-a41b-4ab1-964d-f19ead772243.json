Liverpool confirmed there will be four English clubs in the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 2009 with a comfortable and clinical defeat of the German champions and Bundesliga leaders. Sadio Man\u00e9 scored twice in a superb individual display while the equally impressive Virgil van Dijk also scored in Liverpool\u2019s first European away win of the season, and arguably their finest under Klopp. The manager said victory at one of European football\u2019s powerhouses, following on from last season\u2019s appearance in the Champions League final, confirmed Liverpool\u2019s place among the elite in the game. \u201cScoring three goals here is massive and a big step for us, a big, big step,\u201d the former Borussia Dortmund manager said. \u201cWe will see what we can do with it but it is a fantastic sign. We set a mark for LFC tonight that we are back on the international landscape as a football club. I am really happy about the result and the fact that we are through. I knew we had a chance but I didn\u2019t expect it would happen, but the boys made it happen and it was really brilliant. \u201cThis is important for where we want to get to. There are some places in world football that whatever team comes here \u2013 Manchester City, Real Madrid, Barcelona \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t expect to win it. They know it\u2019s a tough place to come. This club always has outstandingly strong football teams but we kept them away from our goal as well as possible. There were not too many difficult situations in and around our box and that is a massive sign. \u201cIt is not about playing free-flowing football because that is not possible against a side of this quality, you have to find different ways and we found them. That makes me really proud and happy because I think this club deserves recognition and awareness again. We are back \u2013 that\u2019s good, we have a lot to learn but we are back. We are back. There is no doubt we are back again.\u201d Liverpool suffered an early setback when the captain, Jordan Henderson, limped off with an ankle injury that is set to rule him out of the Premier League trip to Fulham on Sunday. Andy Robertson also picked up a booking in stoppage time that means he will miss the first leg of the quarter-finals but they were the only blemishes on an otherwise impeccable night for Klopp\u2019s team. He said: \u201cI see it like all the boys see it in dressing room and everybody who sees it with us, it is a big night. The only shadow is Hendo twisting his ankle, but it is Hendo so hopefully not too serious. It is always a bad sign when you have to change early, you don\u2019t want that in the middle of the park. We wanted fresh legs, not to rest Fabinho but to bring in fresh legs. We wanted to play more football than we did in first half, and we changed and did that in the second half much better. \u201cIn the first half we scored an outstanding goal \u2013 wow \u2013 and by half-time time everybody knew it would not be easy for Munich, and that is important information for the opponent after they were happy with a 0-0 at Anfield. You have to try and impress the other team and we did that. I was really happy with how strong the second half was, how mature it was, how much football we played. Bayern has so much quality, unbelievable, and we impressed them and that\u2019s a massive thing.\u201d Klopp insisted he took no extra satisfaction from Liverpool\u2019s victory in eliminating his former Bundesliga rivals from the Champions League. \u201cI am not like this. It\u2019s not sweeter for me because it\u2019s Bayern. It doesn\u2019t bring back better results from the time when we lost. I wanted to win for Liverpool, not to beat Bayern. It\u2019s just a good moment for Liverpool and let\u2019s enjoy that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
