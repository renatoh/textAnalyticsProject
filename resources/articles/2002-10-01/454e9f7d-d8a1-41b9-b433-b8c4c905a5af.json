A baker's dozen of the 16 on duty for Derby at Valley Parade were aged 23 and under and one, the 17-year-old striker Izale McLeod, had not even played for the reserves when he was selected for the first team four games ago. Not that it was apparent as McLeod, whose pace and physical presence are reminiscent of a youthful Emile Heskey, showed scant respect for his elders. \"We had to do it because of the injury problems we've got,\" said Derby's manager John Gregory. \"We threw him in knowing we had nothing to lose. He's done well and caught the eye.\" Likewise the midfielders Adam Bolder and Adam Murray, who are taking advantage of a Pride Park casualty list including Fabrizio Ravanelli, Branko Strupar, Craig Burley and Deon Burton. Murray harmed his prospects of keeping his place when he became the second Derby player sent off, after a reckless challenge in the game's final moments. He faces a three-match suspension. But Gregory is not convinced the vacancy will be filled by one of Derby's fit-again stars. \"If some of the so-called names were to get fit there's no guarantee they'd get back in the team,\" he said. \"The ones who are in the side at the moment are very together because they don't feel intimidated by anyone else in the team. \"The spirit in the dressing room has been first class and they certainly won't let anyone down through lack of enthusiasm or effort. If only we could add a little bit of nous - two or three others like Robert Lee.\" Any chance Derby had of winning an unmemorable encounter ended when Lee collected his second booking 18 minutes from time. But Bradford's manager Nicky Law used Lee's exit as an excuse for failure to seal victory. \"Derby put more men behind the ball after that and made it difficult for us to get the goal I felt would win the game,\" he said. In Michael Proctor Bradford had the one player who looked capable of penetrating a populous defence. \"He cut Derby to pieces at times,\" added Law, who fears the goal famine and managerial change at Sunderland will scupper his chances of extending the striker's loan spell into a third month. \"It surprises me he's not had more of a look-in at Sunderland, given their lack of goals. I hope the new manager Howard Wilkinson doesn't think like that and he leaves him here.\" Man of the match: Michael Proctor (Bradford City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
