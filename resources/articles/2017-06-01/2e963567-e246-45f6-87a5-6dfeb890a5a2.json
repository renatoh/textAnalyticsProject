Gonski 2.0 could turn it around", "bodyText": "It\u2019s crunch time for whatever Gonski 2.0 package emerges from federal parliament. It comes amid a frenetic debate about who is likely to emerge as short term winners and losers from school funding proposals. As has always happened, deep-seated problems and solutions for the long term take a back seat \u2013 if they are there at all. But there is much more at stake this time around \u2013 and before they vote, legislators might like to consider what the Centre for Policy Development analysis of the latest My School data shows: the failure to implement Gonski 1.0 has made a bad school equity and achievement situation worse. The wrong decision on Gonski 2.0 might make it irreparable. The priority this week is to put in place arrangements which will deliver for the long term. In particular, fast-tracking the funding boost to disadvantaged schools and creating a National Schools Resourcing Body to make it all happen have to be priorities. These two things weren\u2019t done after Gonski 1.0 and the parlous state of current school funding and achievement is a part consequence. Let\u2019s start with the money and where it went after Gonski reported the first time around. Yes, we spent more money on schools, but we did not, across Australia, make sure the funding increasingly favoured those with the greatest need. And this is just on average: in money terms, large numbers of our struggling students and schools went backwards. Why this happened is a long story which includes the patchy implementation of Gonski 1.0, but also reflects the special funding deals made to some school sectors \u2013 deals which have corrupted past attempts to fund schools on need. Fairness and consistency in the future means revisiting the mistakes of the past \u2013 and yes, this has implications: while current proposals will see increased funding to most schools it is hardly surprising that some schools, states and sectors will do better than others. The funding of government schools alone reveals many absurdities. Albury Public School, on one side of the Murray River receives $7969 per student (2015 figures) from its state government, while Wodonga Primary School on the other side receives $6541. But the Wodonga students are markedly less advantaged and more needy in socio-educational terms. With a few mouse clicks anyone can find such examples on the My School website. State government funding of non-government schools is equally erratic. These schools are generously funded in Western Australia, far less so in South Australia. Their combined state and federal government funding in Victoria is so high that it regularly exceeds the public funding of government schools. There are implications of this which the current debate hasn\u2019t even begun to touch. We address some of these in our new report Losing the Game. More distortions have been created by funding from other sources. When it comes to total funding a yawning gap has opened up between schools, based on their sector. Between 2009 and 2015 total per-student funding to Independent schools rose by 34%, to Catholic schools by over 40% and to government schools by just 18%. School fees in most non-government schools, once needed to top up their funding to the level of government schools, now resemble icing on a government-funded cake. Gonski\u2019s conclusion that funding arrangements were complex, confusing, opaque and inconsistent among jurisdictions, and obscured educational goals and accountability remains even more pertinent today. The need for an independent schools resourcing body to plan, coordinate and oversee the funding of schools just hasn\u2019t gone away. If we want to lift Australia\u2019s educational achievement then any plan to prioritise disadvantaged schools is a no brainer. Our ongoing failure to lift the struggling schools has created compounding problems. Parents see what is happening and they have been seeking schools with advantaged students, regardless of sector. On average across Australia our advantaged schools are booming \u2013 while our less advantaged schools are shrinking. The trend is continuing each year. The less advantaged schools are also ending up with an increasing share of the strugglers. We know that, for a variety of reasons, compounding disadvantage in this way acts as a drag on individual and national student achievement. Our research clearly shows that the results of students in advantaged schools are trending slightly higher, but the results of those in disadvantaged schools are clearly drifting lower. Nothing dramatic \u2013 but it just keeps happening. We\u2019ve been analysing data from the My School website for over five years. The story it tells resembles a slow-moving unfolding disaster. It\u2019s not like other disasters: no cataclysmic event and not much that can be summed up in 60 second news grabs. Few headlines can be created from incremental shifts from year to year, but the consistency of the regressive trends is disturbing. The Turnbull government originally planned to bring the funding of disadvantaged schools close to the Schooling Resourcing Standard in ten years. That\u2019s too little, too late. The achievement of this in six years would clearly be a big step forward. It will help schools and school authorities lift, not only the achievement of these schools, but their profile and image \u2013 essential if we are to recreate a critical mass of achieving students in these schools. If we don\u2019t lift these schools we\u2019ll fail to lift the nation. Despite the clear opportunities now before the senate, in recent weeks many people and groups have criticised or roundly rejected the Turnbull Government\u2019s proposed reforms. This reflects a range of positions, from well-founded scepticism and concern after litany of false dawns and fudged promises, to, one fears, cynical opposition for narrow political advantage. Some of the arguments have merit: the government\u2019s proposal is far from perfect, and the risk of structurally locking in underfunding of the public schools that rely disproportionately on fiscally stretched state budgets will need to be carefully managed. But the benefits of entrenching a consistent focus on disadvantage and need at the highest level outweigh the costs \u2013 especially when additional funding to target this need can, and should, be invested by future governments. If we miss the opportunity, the ultimate losers will be the disadvantaged schools and students \u2013 overwhelmingly in the public system \u2013 who have been on the wrong end of the education funding game for far too long. This week we could start to turn things around."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
