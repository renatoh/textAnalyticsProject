The MoD over the past 10 years has seen an increase in legal challenges from civilians alleging human rights abuses, mainly as a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and from members of the armed services or their families. The 51-page Commons defence select committee report says: \"The number of cases and the requirement for full and detailed investigations of every death resulting from armed conflict is putting a significant burden on the MoD and the armed forces, not just in resources spent but in the almost unlimited potential for retrospective claims against them.\" The cross-party group of MPs did not offer a solution that would \"resolve the sense the law is adversely impacting on operational effectiveness\" but recommended that the government should be thinking about ways in which the armed forces can engage in future conflicts certain in the knowledge of which laws apply. Among many cases was the Iraqi Baha Mousa, who died in British army custody in Basra in 2003, resulting in one soldier being jailed. The MPs acknowledge the Mousa case, describing it as \"horrific\". It was right in such cases that the full weight of the law should be applied, they said. But the MPs also found that most of the growing number of cases brought against the MoD have resulted from claims of breaches of the European convention on human rights, many of which they said proved to be unfounded. As well as court cases involving civilians, the MPs expressed concern about cases brought by service personnel or their families. They were worried in particular about the principle of \"combat immunity\", which provides against cases of negligence for decisions made in the heat of battle, being undermined. In June 2013 the supreme court ruled that families and military personnel should be allowed to bring negligence cases against the MoD for injury or death. \"This seems to us to risk the judicialisation of war and to be incompatible with the accepted contract entered into by service personnel and the nature of soldiering,\" the report says. \"It also challenges the doctrine of the best application of proportionate response with the unintended consequence that it might lead to far bloodier engagements on the battlefield as commanders may take fewer risks with their own troops and make more use of close air support or remotely actioned weapons, resulting in greater violence against the opposition with potentially greater numbers of civilian casualties. More legal certainty might result in less destructive conflicts.\" The report says many military personnel have been called to give evidence in court cases, coroners' inquests and inquiries. \"Recently retired senior commanders have told us that this undermines the willingness of personnel to accept responsibility and to take necessary risk with the consequent impact on operational effectiveness.\" Commenting on the MPs' findings, Brigadier Ben Barry, a specialist on land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said there was nothing in the report that he would challenge. Incidents of abuse greatly reduced the legitimacy of British operations in Iraq, Barry said. \"They show that whatever the operational context, it is vital that armed forces get the basics right, making sure that their conduct meets the basic international and domestic legal requirements,\" Barry said. Philippa Tuckman, partner and military injuries lawyer at Bolt Burdon Kemp, said the MoD should be open to being sued. She said: \"In battle, armed service personnel accept huge risks on behalf of us all but they must have rights just like any other employee where part of the danger can reasonably be avoided by care beforehand. These rights must be protected. \"Granting the MoD a right to combat immunity in situations where the negligence took place as part of their preparations for a tour of duty or maintenance of their equipment would be a massive step backward.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
