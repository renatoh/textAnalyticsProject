His first touch was a beautiful piece of velcro control as the ball dropped on to his left boot in the first minute, making everyone in the away end go weak at the knees, and the Arsenal midfielder even had a fan in the opposition\u2019s technical area. It was Roy Hodgson, of course, who sent eyebrows rocketing skywards when he named Wilshere in England\u2019s Euro 2016 squad. Wilshere had only just returned from one of his many injuries, but that misguided show of faith from Hodgson was easier to understand after watching him help Arsenal recover from a sticky spell in the second half to take Palace apart. Like Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Hodgson is a believer, even though the 25-year-old has not produced much of note since that wonderful performance against Pep Guardiola\u2019s great Barcelona side. Recently there has even been plenty of talk that Wilshere might be allowed to leave Arsenal when his contract runs out next summer. There are times when even hopeless romantics like Wenger have to be cold and ruthless. Fortunately for Arsenal\u2019s manager, however, there remains a chance that he will be rewarded for listening to his heart. Loaned to Bournemouth at the start of last season, it felt like Wilshere was approaching the end of his time as an elite footballer when he suffered a broken leg in April. That curtailed his preparations for this campaign, meaning that he was in danger of becoming Arsenal\u2019s forgotten man just when he was supposed to be approaching his prime. He turns 26 on New Year\u2019s Day and instead of being a regular starter in the league, he was forced to adjust to the slog of appearances alongside the kids and the reserves in low-intensity Carabao Cup and Europa League games. Wilshere embraced the challenge, however, and here he was on a bitterly cold December evening in south\u2011east London, starting for the fourth consecutive league game and looking every inch like the talent who was once hailed as the future of Arsenal and England\u2019s midfield. A player who has received as many blows as Wilshere must be careful not to ask too much of his body. There have been times when his bravery in possession, the way that he pushes the ball forward and tempts opponents into forceful challenges, has conspired against him, leading to long spells on the sidelines. Clearly, though, Wilshere is not afraid of hard work, which he demonstrated with a smart early challenge on Wilfried Zaha. He has been impressive since winning back his place in the first team and there are signs that he is giving Arsenal\u2019s midfield more balance. He is more disciplined than the injured Aaron Ramsey, who likes to burst forward in the style of Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard, but he is also technically sound and it was his glorious pass from a deep position which allowed Alexis S\u00e1nchez to calm Arsenal\u2019s nerves midway through the second half. Arsenal had been rocking after Andros Townsend equalised for Palace shortly after the break. The visitors dominated the opening period, taking the lead when Shkodran Mustafi stroked home the rebound after suspect goalkeeping from Juli\u00e1n Speroni, and they had chances to take the game away from their lowly hosts. Mesut \u00d6zil and Alexandre Lacazette missed decent chances, though, and such profligacy left Wenger\u2019s side vulnerable. They have been disappointing on their travels in the league this season \u2013 they had only won at Burnley and Everton before arriving in this corner of south-east London \u2013 and their flakiness resurfaced after Townsend swept home Zaha\u2019s cutback from the left. In those moments it was possible to see why there can be no guarantees Arsenal will regain their spot in the top four. Sloppy defending also allowed James Tomkins to nod home Palace\u2019s second in the 89th minute, creating a nervous finale. Ending Palace\u2019s eight-match unbeaten run required a gutsy display, however, especially as Arsenal were beaten 3-0 here in April. Those memories briefly came flooding back after Townsend\u2019s leveller, but Arsenal\u2019s individual brilliance made the difference. S\u00e1nchez roused himself, lashing a venomous shot past Speroni, and then Wilshere superbly released the Chilean to score his second. Wenger continues to insist that Wilshere will extend his deal if the terms are right. Performances of this class will do wonders for his bargaining power and his hopes of going to next summer\u2019s World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
