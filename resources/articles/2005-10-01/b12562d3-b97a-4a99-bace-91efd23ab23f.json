Even fading pop star Mick Hucknall has attended two parties at Chequers - twice as many as Gordon Brown. The party's intimate early association with academia, on the other hand, has largely been forgotten. Professor Anthony Giddens, the brains behind the Third Way, praised Tony Blair in 1999 for being \"as keen to work with intellectuals as any other prime minister I can think of in recent memory\". The prime minister reciprocated by making \"Tony's Tony\" a life peer in May last year. At its most simple, the Third Way was an attempt to imbue free-market capitalism with a social conscience. It sought a compromise between the top-down Keynesian consensus of the postwar period and the unfettered neo-liberalism of the 1980s. It was neither old left nor old right. It favoured a market economy but not a market society. The concept initially enjoyed significant international support as a wave of social democratic, centre-left governments won power in the late 1990s. Third Way aficionados held office in the US (Bill Clinton), Britain (Tony Blair), Germany (Gerhard Schr\u00f6der), France (Lionel Jospin) and Italy (Giuliano Amato). Even Colonel Gaddafy jumped on the bandwagon, claiming that he had coined the concept first before Blair stole it from him. However, a successful first summit in Florence in November 1999 signified the high point of the Third Way's international appeal. Since then most of its founders have been replaced by right-wing opponents. While the international spirit of the Third Way still survives - notably in Peter Mandelson's Policy Network which organises the annual Progressive Governance Summits - the term itself is seldom used. \"We tend to concentrate on smaller, high-level discussions now,\" says Matt Browne, its director. In the UK the term has also fallen out of common political usage, although proponents claim that it has created a new consensus. \"Every left-of-centre party is now in some ways a Third Way party,\" says its architect, Lord Giddens. \"It has kept the British Labour party in power for three terms. And it appears to be forcing the Conservatives to move back to the centre ground.\" As Bill Clinton said to the Labour Party conference in October 2002, \"The ultimate case for the Third Way is that it works.\" Critics on the left, however, dismiss it as little more than warmed-up Thatcherism. \"New Labour thought that it was necessary to have a philosophy to make it look respectable,\" wrote Tony Benn in 2002. \"So the Third Way was invented.\" John Prescott once joked at a party conference that he searched for a book on the Third Way and found it under the \"mystery\" section. Critics on the right, for their part, have ridiculed it as a vacuous strategy for winning elections. David Miliband, now communities and local government minister, almost admitted as much in an interview with the Washington Post in 2002. The Third Way, he conceded, was better suited to opposition than to administration. \"It is a very good way of throwing out a right-wing government,\" he said. Ultimately, though, the phrase also appears to be fairly disposable. Ask the Labour party's website to search for \"the Third Way\" and it replies, \"Sorry, your search was empty.\" Tony Blair might be obsessed with his legacy, but we are unlikely to hear the strains of \"I did it the Third Way\" floating down Whitehall as he faces his final curtain. \u00b7 Do you have a forgotten news story that you would like chased up?
