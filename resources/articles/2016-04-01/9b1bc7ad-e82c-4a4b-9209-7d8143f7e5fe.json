Villa are still weighing up their options and considering the merits of other names on their shortlist but Pearson is the standout candidate and it is understood that he already has the support of several members of the club\u2019s board. Powell has a good relationship with Pearson, having played for him during the manager\u2019s first spell in charge at Leicester and also coached at the club during that period. The former Huddersfield Town and Charlton Athletic manager is well respected in the game, knows the Championship and it is believed that he would be receptive to the idea of working with Pearson again. With Steve Walsh and Craig Shakespeare now working under Claudio Ranieri at Leicester and expected to sign new contracts with the Premier League leaders before the end of the month, there is no prospect of Pearson being reunited with his former backroom staff at Villa or anywhere else next season. With that in mind, Pearson has been forced to explore other avenues and Powell has emerged as a potential No2. Villa, for the moment, are preaching caution about their search for a successor to R\u00e9mi Garde. The decision rests in the hands of Villa\u2019s new football board, comprising of David Bernstein, Sir Mervyn King, Brian Little and Adrian Bevington. Steve Hollis, the chairman, will submit their recommendation to Randy Lerner, the Villa owner, to rubber-stamp the appointment. David Moyes, Sean Dyche and Steve Bruce are also in the frame but Pearson has the strongest credentials for the post. The 52-year-old, who has been out of work since leaving the King Power Stadium in controversial circumstances last June, proved at Leicester that he is capable of reviving a struggling club and winning promotion to the Premier League. There is also a school of thought that Pearson\u2019s strong personality could be just what Villa need at this time. Once Villa\u2019s inevitable relegation to the Championship has been confirmed it is likely that an appointment will be made fairly swiftly, although being in the dugout on the day that Villa officially go down is unlikely to appeal to Pearson or anyone else. Villa\u2019s fate could be sealed on Saturday before they play Manchester United, if 17th-placed Norwich pick up a point at home against Sunderland in the early kick-off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
