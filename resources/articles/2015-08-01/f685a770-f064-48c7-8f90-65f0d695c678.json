Fire spokesman Rick Isaacson said on Monday that the Okanogan Complex of wildfires grew overnight to just over 400 square miles, slightly more than the Carlton fires, which also burned in Okanogan County last summer. How big is it? Late morning local time on Monday, officials said the complex of fires had burned 256,567 acres, or just over 400 square miles. For comparison, New York City is just over 300 square miles, Los Angeles is about 500 square miles, and London is just over 600 square miles. The fire has burned an area roughly one-fifth the size of Delaware. Okanogan County is just over 5,300 square miles. The smoke, however, is reaching an even bigger area. The animated map below was created by the US forest service AirFire research team and shows the last two days of smoke billowing from the Okanogan fires and others burning around Washington state. How dangerous is it? Eastern Washington University on Monday canceled football practice because smoke from nearby fire made the air too unhealthy to breathe. The Spokesman-Review newspaper reported the air quality index in Spokane, about 150 miles from Okanogan County, was at 189; anything above 150 is thought to be unhealthy for outdoor exercise. Last week, three firefighters were killed and four injured near Twisp, in Okanogan County, when a \u201chellstorm\u201d apparently surrounded their car. Four other firefighters were hurt; one was released from hospital on Monday, while another remains in critical condition, according to local reports. How fast is it? The Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal spent the weekend in Omak, a small town that has the Okanogan Complex fires burning on three sides. No one, he says, is talking about beating the fires any time soon. \u201cIt\u2019s like eating an elephant,\u201d Larry Trapp, head of air firefighting operations out of Omak airport, told McGreal. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to eat little pieces and you just keep biting away at it until you win.\u201d When will it end? Isaacson noted that Monday 24 August is still early in the fire season, meaning the fires could burn for several more months. \u201cThis will be an extended period of time when we will continue to fight fire,\u201d firefighter Matt Reidy said this weekend. \u201cThe predictions for September are equally dry and hot.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
