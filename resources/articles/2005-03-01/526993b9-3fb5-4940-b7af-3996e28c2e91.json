The firm said shareholders included Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen as well as Lee Entertainment and Vivendi Universal Entertainment. But the company's founders, Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, are not selling any of their shares. Shares in DreamWorks, the maker of A Shark's Tale and Shrek, dropped on Wall Street as investors absorbed news of the planned sale. The company only floated on the stock market back in October. At the time of the initial public offering, Mr Allen, who founded Microsoft along with his friend Bill Gates, reaped $60m from the sale of shares. He retained 34.6m shares in the business. Lee Entertainment had 5.7m after the flotation with Vivendi Universal holding 2.7m. Mr Allen became DreamWorks' largest shareholder after pumping $660m into the business having been approached by the company's three founders just over 10 years ago. The driving force behind the business was Mr Katzenberg who put the company together after he was ousted from his job as head of studios at Disney by boss Michael Eisner. While working at Disney Mr Katzenberg was responsible for animated hits includ ing Aladdin and The Lion King. Mr Allen, however, is likely to view the returns he receives from the sale of more of his shares in DreamWorks as small change. He is ranked among the top 10 richest people in the world. The sale of shares in the business will be completed sometime after May 27, DreamWorks said in an official filing to the securities and exchange commission yesterday, when the company's latest feature, Madagascar, is due to be released. This month DreamWorks reported better than expected figures, boosted by $360m of revenues from Shrek 2. The film was the third most successful US box-office release of all time, taking $436m. Worldwide it brought in $881m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
