William P Young's SPBS, The Shack, has been the \"buzz book\" in the US for the past 18 months. Young (known as \"Paul\", like the apostle) is an Oregon salesman with an interest in web design. He composed The Shack as a gift for his children at Christmas 2005, something that would explain the mysterious ways in which God works. He typeset the story on his computer and had it bound at the local print shop. His two pastors (kicking in a start-up fund of $300) encouraged him to self-publish. Registering themselves as Windblown Media, they dispatched copies from the Youngs' family garage. Lots and lots of copies, as the months passed. Word of mouth became word of web. The Shack was blogged and hyped by Christian radio into the bestseller lists. Its American sales are verging on 2m. The plot is simple. God takes exception to little girls getting murdered by serial killers and posts a bereaved parent a note on the subject. \"He\" cares. A huge number of readers testify on the web that The Shack brought them closer to their Creator. And, perhaps, their mailman. Christian fiction is big in the US. In bookshops, that section is usually larger than science fiction (although regular Christian publishers turned down The Shack on the grounds that it was too \"edgy\"). Young himself calls his bestsellerdom a \"miracle\", clearly discerning the kind of assistance you can't expect from the average publicity department. Is The Shack the Blair Witch Project of the modern book world? Does it demonstrate that with modern e-tools literary talent can find a way around the cumbersome apparatus of the publishing industry? Is it a portent? Probably not. The famous novelists who have self-published could supply a well-rounded literary education: Mark Twain, DH Lawrence, Anais Nin, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Margaret Atwood, et al. They are proudly listed on self-publishing guru John Kremer's \"self-publishing hall of fame\" (bookmarket.com/selfpublish.html). But, like Paul Young, these novelists typically did it at the break-in stage of their careers. Once inside, they signed up quite happily to the mainstream commercial book world. The Shack, which arrives on our shores this week, is not, alas, being published here with a \u00a3150 handout from Radio 4's Thought for the Day team. It is published by Hodder and Stoughton, in an initial print run of 25,000. They won't be dispatching it from Mr Hodder's garage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
