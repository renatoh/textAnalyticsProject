The government is invoking the terminology of \"pilots\", \"rounds\", \"single area budget\" and \"options for pooling or aligning resources\", which echoes the development of the predecessor funding regime of the Department for Communities and Local Government's local area agreements (LAAs). As with community budgets, LAAs were an attempt to rationalise the disparate funding regimes of the different ministries as a centralist response to local managerial problems. Community budgets are similar, but with the benefit of hindsight (the experience of the Total Place programme) to provide a veil of ambition of the benefit to public services end-users. There is still no main driver or overarching strategy to integrate the system of local public services and the way in which individuals engage with these services. I have argued elsewhere that factors afflicting the local public services system cannot be resolved without certain changes. As it stands, these services have been unable to resolve or significantly ameliorate often post-industrial related issues found in local communities \u2013 commonly referred to \"wicked issues\" (complex, hard to solve problems that are frequently inter-generational, such as low attainment and skills levels, unemployment, etc). Whatever the cause, these inter-related factors cannot be significantly addressed without utilising the \"tools\" of government, that is adapting existing funding mechanisms, creating incentivisation through existing mechanisms for local partnership work and service delivery \"to make things work better for local people\". All relevant funding for local public service delivery should be accessed locally through Local Strategic Partnerships, the local bodies that bring together providers and key stakeholders. LSPs, building upon their work on the sustainable community strategy and the experience of LAAs, should be open to local membership. Together, they would undertake an analysis of local issues for public service delivery and develop a needs assessment, a strategy and an action plan. The themes, programmes and projects would be a smart government approach, identifying service providers and providing a locally determined performance management framework and open dataset. This LSP work can be presented as a document to be negotiated with perhaps the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. This is the way to kickstart local public services to the benefit of all members of the local population, not just families. Local people and frontline workers are core to this approach to co-ordinate and integrate local activities in the best interests of the end user, not the central or local public service organisation managers. Perhaps this is a good way to engage with frontline workers as opposed to encouraging managerial changes in organisations, promoting the development of mutuals and the enforced introduction of competing providers. These proposals will change the whole system. Only this locally determined local service provision would be funded by the government, ensuring that there is a co-ordinated approach. Necessary efficiencies for local organisations would accrue from the process. The focus for the work of the LSP ensures that the preconditions for local growth are considered along with the idea that what is good for local communities is good for local business and vice-versa as an overarching objective. This movement (driven centrally by the Treasury and supported by Number 10) in turn provides the opportunity for business to engage with and add value to local public expenditure decisions. It facilitates investment and the development of the local private sector economy. Quite clearly, there has been an evolving managerialist model for the funding and provision of local public service provision which has become increasingly distant from directly addressing local community issues. This, despite the excellent practice of frontline workers. While I would advocate an approach to address the managerialist model and the deficiencies mentioned above, I have also reflected on the cyclical movement arising from the introduction of similar CLG funding regimes. I see the evolving community budgets regime as the current representation of this. As a pragmatist, I'm supportive of local areas in resolving these issues by engaging local communities and valuable frontline workers who are attempting to work to individual needs.
