Bilic believes high pressing is the key to knocking City out of their stride and that, combined with a drop in confidence, has left them vulnerable after a dominant start to the Premier League campaign. The manager insists his West Ham side go into the match in good form, despite losing their past two matches. \u201cSome teams tried to press them even in the early period of the season,\u201d Bilic said of City, \u201cbecause we knew from Germany and from Spain how they would play. But they were coming out of that pressing more than now. \u201cAfter you have three or four wins on the trot then the opponent may be pressing you but you are not scared. OK, you can occasionally lose the ball but you don\u2019t care; at the end of the day, it\u2019s the plan. But after you make some mistakes and it ends in defeat then you think twice about it. You try it again but you are not that confident any more. It\u2019s like a chain.\u201d Bilic believes Guardiola will continue to implement the style of play that made him so successful at Barcelona and Bayern Munich and that it is up to City\u2019s players to take responsibility to adapt those tactics when necessary. \u201cThe manager has his philosophy and the manager guides you as a player but at the end of the day it\u2019s your decision [as a player],\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are in the box, if you don\u2019t know where you are because you were ball-watching and you are in front of your own goal, no manager is expecting you to get the ball on your chest. \u201cIt\u2019s always the player\u2019s decision. If you are talking about Guardiola I have seen [Gerard] Piqu\u00e9 putting the ball in the stands when necessary. It\u2019s the player\u2019s decision \u2013 always.\u201d West Ham had a mixed festive period, beating Burnley and Hull City and thumping Swansea away 4-1 before losing to Leicester City and Manchester United. Their performance against United gave Bilic confidence, especially since the defeat came after the dismissal of Sofiane Feghouli, whose red card has been rescinded. \u201cI think definitely the players are starting to get their confidence back\u201d, Bilic said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we put in great performances against Burnley and Hull but we got six points. Then in the last couple of games we played well. There were a lot of positives from these games and that\u2019s why I\u2019m optimistic. Despite the defeats it has been very positive. \u201cI was happy when I heard the news [of Feghouli\u2019s successful appeal],\u201d Bilic added, \u201cbut it\u2019s happened to us four times \u2013 that\u2019s a kind of a record. It\u2019s good that the committee have overturned the verdict and we are happy. But it\u2019s four games where the decisions were clearly against us.\u201d Bilic\u2019s side go into the FA Cup tie with \u201cbig ambitions\u201d and he said the trophy has not suffered any loss in status, despite the dominance of the Premier League. \u201cIt has changed in some of the countries but not here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gap came when the European Cup became the Champions League \u2013 before that it was just the league and the cup in every country. But when the Champions League came in and the Uefa Cup went down and the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup disappeared, not only the big clubs but those big enough were only dreaming about being in the Champions League. \u201cIn England and Germany the cup was always important, especially the FA Cup. The FA Cup was just below the Premiership, just below. It was a massive game and still is. \u201cNow in most of the countries, in Italy or France or Spain, you can see how they are taking the cup seriously again. Even Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain. So the cup is back. But here it is the same as when I played and watched it on the TV before I was a manager. The FA Cup never lost its size.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
