Mr Jacobs, who was 61, was found by his wife hanging in stables at their home in Oxton, near Nottingham. His family had reported him missing earlier that day. Mr Jacobs, a grandfather, had worked for the chain for 17 years. His family said that the collapse of the furniture chain, which brought about the loss of his retirement security, \"was a cross he found intolerable to bear\". A statement issued on behalf of the family by solicitor Duncan MacLaren said: \"The family of James Jacobs, lately an associate director of Courts plc, are devastated by the sudden and untimely death of a loving husband, father and grandfather. \"James devoted his working life to the British furniture industry, for the past 17 years with Courts, and was a well known and highly respected stalwart of the industry. \"The failure of the company was a cross which James found intolerable to bear. \"His family mourn his passing and in facing an uncertain future without the rock upon whom they have depended for so long, express their own sympathy and support for the families of so many other Courts employees who must be experiencing their own anguish at this time.\" The company was founded in 1850 and has 350 stores worldwide, 100 of which were in the UK. It went into receivership at the end of November with debts of \u00a3280m. It is thought the group's pension pot carries a deficit of around \u00a314m. Members of the scheme have called on the pensions ombudsman to investigate after it was reported that a director, Howard Cohen, had legally transferred \u00a33.9m out of the group fund and into a personal pension scheme in March 2004. Mr MacLaren added: \"Mr Jacobs found himself at the end of his working life in a situation he was unfamiliar with - being a senior employee of a company that had failed and therefore having to start again.\" A Nottinghamshire police spokesman said the family had reported Mr Jacobs missing just after 6pm on Tuesday evening. Officers searched the family home along with Mrs Jacobs and found his body soon after in the stables. A spokesman said: \"There are no suspicious circumstances and a file is being prepared for the coroner.\" An inquest will take place at a future date. Stephen Ross, the independent trustee of the pension scheme, is believed to be planning to write to the 500 members in the coming weeks to outline his plans to investigate every aspect of the fund."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
