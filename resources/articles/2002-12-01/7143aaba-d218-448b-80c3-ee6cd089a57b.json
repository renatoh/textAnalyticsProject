With first-choice rider Tony Dobbin claimed by Len Lungo, Hors La Loi's trainer James Fanshawe has secured the ser vices of Walsh for both Hors La Loi and Eternal Spring, who runs in the Relkeel Hurdle, which opens the card. Frost threatens today's jumps meeting at Leicester, which is subject to a morning inspection, but all-weather racing at Lingfield is guaranteed and George Stubbs (3.40) looks sure to go well. George Stubbs finished a close fourth behind Alchemist Master over a mile here last week. His new trainer, Nick Littmoden, is to be respected at Lingfield as is his jockey Ian Mongan who prefers George Stubbs to the stable's other runner, Alessandro Severo. Luca Cumani's Lagudin (2.15) is favoured by the conditions of the Construction News Stakes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
