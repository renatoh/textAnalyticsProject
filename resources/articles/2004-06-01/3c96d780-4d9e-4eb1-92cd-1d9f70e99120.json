The British No1 received an ovation from a packed centre court crowd at the start of the match, his first since his storming run to the semi-finals of the French Open. But, having received a first-round bye as the No 4 seed, Henman was broken to love in the opening game of this second round match and did not even win a point until the third game. Beck, ranked 79 in the world, looked in prime form, having won the Surbiton grass court tournament last week. Before today, however, he had never beaten a player in the world top ten. Henman fought back to win the second set 6-3, but only after surviving break points in two service games. The final set went with serve, before a tense tie-break that saw Beck save a match point at 5-6 and go on to win 8-6. The defeat could leave Henman short of match practice on grass, with Wimbledon only 12 days away. He may apply for a wild card at next week's Nottingham Open to get some more matches under his belt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
