The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said \u201cobligatory celibacy\u201d for Catholic priests \u201cmay \u2026 have contributed to abuse in some circumstances\u201d, and recommended priests undergo \u201cpsycho-sexual development\u201d training. Council CEO Francis Sullivan told Guardian Australia that priests needed to undergo \u201ceducation\u201d to develop emotional and sexual awareness, \u201clike what you and I do as adults\u201d. \u201cBecause they are in an environment, in a service, that\u2019s very intimate and close with people, they need to be quite clear about the boundaries, and what is and isn\u2019t appropriate,\u201d he said. Sullivan said the group was not suggesting abolishing the vow of celibacy, but rather addressing how priests can \u201ckeep the integrity of their vows\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about learning the risks of blurring the boundaries. Knowing the risks that intimacy can bring,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not talking about lifting the vow of celibacy.\u201d Sullivan said the issue of celibacy had been raised numerous times in royal commission hearings, and said it was clear the commission would spend more time on it. \u201cWhen you have got a major inquiry into the sex abuse culture in the Catholic church, you can\u2019t just put your head in the sand. It\u2019s very clear that in some cases there have been inadequate professional cross-boundaries in their service of their parishioners,\u201d he said. The report said the church\u2019s response to child sex abuse had been shaped by its culture and \u201cclericalism\u201d, which it defined as an \u201cordained ministry geared to power over others, not service to others\u201d. \u201cChurch institutions and their leaders, over many decades, seemed to turn a blind eye, either instinctively or deliberately, to the abuse happening within their diocese or religious order, protecting the institution rather than caring for the child,\u201d the report said. It said the selection process for priests may have contributed to a culture that ignored abuse. The report also said the council would support a national statutory compensation scheme for victims of child sexual abuse above providing compensation directly to victims. \u201cThe church should no longer investigate itself. It does not have the trust of victims,\u201d Sullivan said. The council was formed by Australian Catholic church leaders in 2013 in response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. In its first 12 months it received evidence that abuse had occurred at 703 Catholic institutions, including schools, in Australia. Catholic institutions made up 40% of all institutions subject to complaint. Almost 30% of the child sexual abuse survivors who gave evidence to the royal commission in its first 12 months were abused by a member of the clergy, of all denominations. The commission was extended this year and is expected to deliver its final report in 2017."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
