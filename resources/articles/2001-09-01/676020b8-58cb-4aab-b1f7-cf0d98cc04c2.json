London, Paris and Frankfurt lost ground as investors waited nervously for Wall Street to sputter back to life. Asian markets closed with heavy losses amid fears of military conflict as the US readies for an attack on Afghanistan and worries of global recession. Japan's Nikkei fell 5.04% to its lowest level since December 1983. Korea's KOSPI index dropped 2.8% and shares in Kuala Lumpur were down over 6% in afternoon trade. Airline and insurance stocks led the retreat. Even Chinese investors, who normally ignore outside events, have been gripped by uncertainty after the attacks on the US. The Shanghai B share index tumbled over 6%. Despite talk of a patriotic rally, brokers in Asia and Europe expect at least a 5% drop in New York share prices. But the financial authorities and the leading players on Wall Street stand ready to avert a meltdown. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the American financial watchdog, has relaxed rules on companies buying back shares, so they can boost the market, and the Federal Reserve may announce a cut in interest rates as early as today. The legendary billionaire US investor Warren Buffett said he would not be a seller today and would even be looking for buying opportunities if prices fell hard. \"I won't be selling anything,\" he said. \"And certainly if you owned a piece of an American business that you felt good about a week ago, it would be crazy, in my view, to be selling it at 9.30 tomorrow morning.\" Despite Mr Buffett's upbeat comments, profit warnings from two of America's leading companies are expected to weigh heavily on US markets. General Electric and Ford, two of America's leading industrial companies, said last week that the suicide attacks would affect third-quarter results. GE said its Employers Reinsurance Corporation, one of the main insurers of the World Trade Centre towers, would lose $800m (\u00a3543m), and Ford said the attacks had disrupted production plans. In early morning trading the FTSE 100 fell 82.1 points to 4,673, with British Airways again hit hard amid concern over big losses in the airline industry. The index dropped 300 points last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
