Gobbo\u2019s longest registration as police informer \u201cLawyer X\u201d was from 2005 until 2009, when she turned on some of her most high-profile clients, including drug trafficker Tony Mokbel and underworld murderer Carl Williams. In July, Gobbo\u2019s former client Faruk Orman was released from jail after a 12-year sentence when his criminal conviction was overturned, with Gobbo\u2019s informing found to have led to a substantial miscarriage of justice. Speaking to the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program \u2013 her first interview since Victoria announced a royal commission into police informants \u2013 Gobbo said she discovered from media reports that Victoria police first registered her as an informer in 1995. They did so without her knowledge, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I was informing on when I was cooking chips at the MCG and studying full-time,\u201d Gobbo said. \u201cI mean I look back, I think from what I\u2019ve learned now, I think they probably groomed me from day one.\u201d The police informant royal commission had been previously told by chief commissioner Graham Ashton that he was notified in April 2006 of Gobbo\u2019s informing. At the time, Ashton was heading an independent police watchdog that wanted to call her as a witness in an investigation into the suspected involvement of a former policeman, Paul Dale, in the murders of Terence and Christine Hodson. He told the commission he did not know about her earlier registration as an informant until the royal commission. Ashton will conclude his evidence on Wednesday. Gobbo told 7.30 she could not return to Australia because she had been told her two young children would be removed from her due to risks to their safety. Earlier in December, the royal commission ordered Gobbo give evidence over the phone. A failure to comply carries a two-year jail sentence. Gobbo\u2019s lawyers had argued she was mentally unfit to give evidence. \u201cI have been snookered by Victoria police, um banished from Australia, with the ultimate threat you can give to any parent the two most precious things um in my world are my children,\u201d Gobbo said. She added that to produce a witness statement for the commission, she would need at least \u201ca thousand hours\u201d to compile all of her information as well as review some 30,000 pages of commission material. This would be made difficult due to the extreme pain she still experienced after suffering a stroke in 2004, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating from my point of view for the perception to be that I am a liar and I\u2019m trying to avoid giving evidence,\u201d Gobbo said. Asked if she was concerned about being charged for allegedly altering witness statements and interfering with witnesses, she said that everything she did was at the behest and control of Victoria police. \u201cSo, if I\u2019m to be charged, then um I suppose we\u2019ll be in the dock together.\u201d Gobbo said the homicide squad had pressured and manipulated her. Over the years, her fear of retribution from her former gangland clients if they discovered her informer status was replaced by a fear of the police, she said. \u201cKnowing what I know now about their tactics and about obviously what happened as time went on \u2026 I got played,\u201d she said. \u201cMy overwhelming guilt is for what my children have had to endure. My overwhelming guilt and I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life regretting it, is that something I did \u2026 has had the impact on them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
