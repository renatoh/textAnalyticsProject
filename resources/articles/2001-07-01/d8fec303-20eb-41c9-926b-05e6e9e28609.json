Her debut novel, In Cahoots!, is a guide to midlife dating, featuring three women who went through it all in their 20s and decide they want to do it all over again. Buy In Cahoots! at Amazon.co.uk Phil Hogan's top 10 midlife crisis books 1. Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte The ultimate book of hope for anyone seeking Mr Right. Jane isn't exactly drop dead gorgeous nor does she have a filofax bulging with helpful connections but she gets her man in the end. Granted she has to wait for his mad wife to burn down the house, and he's blind when they reunite, but hey, who's worrying. One of the all time great romances. 2. Rivals by Jilly Cooper Now they are all drop dead gorgeous in this book. This is Jilly's funniest, set in the world of television boardroom battles. Most of the women look like super models, are frighteningly intelligent and have fascinating telly jobs. Well, you can dream, can't you. Or make a start - consult Monday's Media Guardian. 3. High Fidelity by Nick Hornby A cautionary tale for all women. Beware of a man who makes lists, especially of ex-girlfriends, because you know one day you'll be right up there too. A good insight into what goes on inside men's heads, especially if you've been baffled up to now. Rob is a saddo thirtysomething who runs a secondhand record shop. A great fun read and especially nostalgic if you can still sing along with Showaddywaddy's hits. 4. Mens Sana in Thingummy Doodah by Victoria Wood I've slightly cheated here, because these are the scripts of Victoria Wood's side-splitting half-hours. Loads of self-help tips here on dating boring men, avoiding all forms of exercise at a health farm and making a complete dolt of yourself on a television programme. Your life can never be as bad as these characters'. Guffaws guaranteed. 5. Women Who Love Too Much by Robin Norwood If you're stuck in a terrible relationship and can't seem to get out, this serious self-help book might provide the answers. Health warning: it might make you even more depressed and therefore more stuck. Sadly, I found myself shrieking, \"Yes, yes, yes\" at every case study years before the fake orgasm scene in When Harry Met Sally. Read with caution and not in a New York diner. 6. The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella Overdraft celebrating another anniversary? This will make you feel instantly better. Rebecca Bloomwood is a financial journalist and a very serious secret spendaholic. It's a hilarious read and it made me feel quite financially restrained. If you feel your wallet itching, then just buy this book. Even your bank manager will view it as a sound investment. 7. Notes From A Small Island by Bill Bryson If you're feeling fed up, then perhaps you should get out more. Bill Bryson's indispensable and laugh-out-loud guide to Britain will give you some ideas on where to go and where to avoid. Try asking for directions from pub locals and compare results with Bill. 8. The Swish of the Curtain by Pamela Brown My favourite childhood read and a great lesson in self-help via the fantasy route. Seven children renovate an old chapel into a theatre and put on shows. I spent years wanting to be one of them, particularly during boring Latin lessons. A truly wonderful story written by Pamela Brown when she was just 14. 9. Recipes From a Greek Island by Susie Jacobs My cooking sort of died in the 70s and there's a limit to how much prawn cocktail, steak and black forest gateau you can keep knocking up. I occasionally buy cookbooks but find them terribly unnerving. This one is perfect. The recipes are far too complicated for me but the photographs of Greece are just breathtaking. I hand it around for guests to admire while I'm ringing the takeaway. 10. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen Another classic that falls neatly into the fantasy category. A wonderful romantic tale of love triumphing over snobbery. Girls finally get their men, despite pushy mum. And if that doesn't grab you, just remember that fantastic TV version with Colin Firth, emerging from a lake in his drenched white shirt. I rest my case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
