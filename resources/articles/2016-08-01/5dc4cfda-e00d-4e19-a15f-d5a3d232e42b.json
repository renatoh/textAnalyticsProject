The original size of the Russian team was 389. Igor Kazikov, the head of Russia\u2019s Olympic delegation, told the Russian news agency Tass that the International Olympic Committee has ruled in favour of the swimmers Yuliya Efimova, Natalya Lovtsova, Darya Ustinova, Mikhail Dovgalyuk and Anastasia Krapivina. Nikita Lobintsev and Vladimir Morozov, the first two athletes to take their cases to the court of arbitration for sport following the publication of the McLaren report, were also said to have been reinstated on appeal. Tass also reported that Olga Zabelinskaya, who won cycling bronze medals in the road race and time trial at London 2012, is now eligible to compete, as is her fellow cyclist Sergei Shilov. A third member of the cycling squad, Ilnur Zakarin, was cleared to compete but opted not to participate due to the effect the uncertainty had on his preparation for Rio. Efimova, the breaststroke specialist and four-times world champion, posted a picture of herself on Instagram accompanied by the caption: \u201cI\u2019m going to the Olympics. I couldn\u2019t be more proud and relieved.\u201d Although there was no immediate confirmation from swimming\u2019s governing body of the reinstatements, and start lists remain unaltered, the Russian news agency R-Sport quoted Vladimir Salnikov, head of the country\u2019s swimming federation, as saying Fina had written to Cas to confirm it supported the readmission of Efimova and other previously banned Russian swimmers. A spokesman for the governing body declined to comment, saying the federation would issue a statement \u201cif we have something to say\u201d. Cas had previously said an IOC rule barring Russian athletes with a prior doping conviction from competing was unenforceable, paving the way for a raft of late appeals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
