The consequences would, in fact, probably be even more bleak than he outlines. There would be large numbers of civilian deaths, since many of the key nuclear facilities are in highly populated urban areas. Also there are strong reasons to believe that military strikes could accelerate an Iranian nuclear-weapons programme. Limited western intelligence about Iran's nuclear programme means that many hundreds of strikes would still not destroy all nuclear-related facilities and materials. Popular outrage at such strikes would strengthen hardliners within the regime, legitimising the move from a gradual and relatively open nuclear-power programme to a clandestine crash nuclear-weapons programme using secret facilities and salvaged materials, and possibly procuring supplies from the black market, outside of nuclear non-proliferation treaty controls. Under crash nuclear-weapons programme conditions, Iran could build a nuclear weapon within two years if the decision was made. This is less time than the evidence suggests Iran could manage with the current programme. John Sloboda Executive director, Oxford Research Group Julian Borger (Decision time for US over Iran threat, November 16) writes that, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency's latest report, \"Iran has installed 3,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium - enough to begin industrial-scale production of nuclear fuel and build a warhead within a year\". But nowhere in the report does it mention that Iran can build a warhead within a year. The New York Times on the same day reports the 3,000 installed centrifuges, but only says that \"in theory, that means that it could produce enough uranium to make a nuclear weapon within a year to 18 months\". Furthermore it reports that, according to the IAEA, the centrifuges were operating well below their capacity, and that so far the IAEA had found no evidence that Iran was enriching to a level that would produce bomb-grade fuel. But both Borger's and the NYT's estimates to produce a bomb were too optimistic. As reported by the Irish Times on October 22, Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the IAEA, said: \"Supposing that Iran does intend to acquire a nuclear bomb, it would need between another three and eight years to succeed.\" He added that all the intelligence services agree on that. Rosli Omar Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Jonathan Freedland's article on Iran (Comment, November 14) misses the main point. We are demanding that Iran refrain from manufacturing nuclear weapons under the non-proliferation treaty. Yet we are violating that treaty by failing to reduce the number of nuclear weapons we hold, with the ultimate aim of abolishing them. Britain and the US intend to modernise their nuclear weapons, in direct contravention of the treaty. An imaginative new approach would be to announce that we are planning a serious reduction in nuclear weapons, invite other signatories to join us, and negotiate with Iran on that basis. If we do not, the terrifying prospect of a nuclear-arms race in the Middle East, to which Freedland refers, is a near-certainty. Geoffrey Hosking London Iran's government believes nuclear power is essential for economic growth. This belief is shared by our government, and others. Four companies produce 95% of the world's enriched uranium. No country can be happy that its energy supplies are so vulnerable, and it is not just Iran that is seeking to protect itself. Brazil is building uranium-enrichment centrifuges, and its programme is about the same size as Iran's. China has just doubled its enrichment capacity. South Korea is doing research into laser enrichment. Iran now complies fully with the NPT, under which IAEA inspections can ensure uranium enrichment does not go beyond the level required for nuclear power. If the west ignores this, the perception in Iran will be that the west's intention is not to prevent proliferation, but to prevent Iran becoming an economic power.
