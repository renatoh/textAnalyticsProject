Mr Radice will also pocket an annual salary of \u00a3425,000, with the chance of doubling his money if performance targets are met. He will run M&amp;S's growing Home division, which sells sofas, lighting and bed linen in 25 stores across the UK. M&amp;S generates more than \u00a3370m in annual sales from the division and plans to set up two \"stand-alone\" Home stores within the next 18 months. The switch stunned analysts in the City, where the 45-year-old Mr Radice has won widespread praise for the way he has revived Selfridges. A \u00a3100m refit of the group's Oxford Street department store in London has helped it capture a new and younger customer base. Mr Radice will leave Selfridges in February. He took over as chief executive when the group demerged from Sears in 1998. M&amp;S chief executive Roger Holmes said the appointment reflected his company's commitment to developing its Home department. \"Vittorio is one of the most able retailers of his generation and I am delighted he has chosen to join the top team at Marks &amp; Spencer,\" he said. Selfridges finance director Peter Williams will replace Mr Radice and the group insisted he was a natural successor. Chairman Alun Cathcart said 48-year-old Mr Williams had been a \"fundamental part\" of Selfridges' recent success. He added: \"Led by Peter, Selfridges will continue to follow the clear strategy set out since demerger in 1998, remaining at the forefront of retail.\" But shares in the group dipped nearly 7% in morning trading as investors fretted about the long-term impact of Mr Radice's departure. The timing of the announcement could not have been worse as Selfridges prepares for the crucial Christmas season. But Richard Ratner, retail analyst at Seymour Pierce, said Mr Williams was \"first class\" and added: \"It's a good move for Marks but far from a disaster for Selfridges.\" The \u00a31.2m golden hello will be paid in share options and a guaranteed bonus to compensate Mr Radice for buying out his existing contract. An M&amp;S spokeswoman defended the size of the financial package put together to lure Mr Radice, which also includes a pension contribution of up to \u00a3120,000. She said: \"For a candidate of this calibre, it is the market rate and he is an exceptional retailer.\" Mr Radice came to the UK in 1990 to join Habitat as buying director. He took up the post of managing director at Selfridges in 1996. The switch highlights M&amp;S's renaissance under Belgian boss Luc Vandevelde and his determination to build on the group's recent recovery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
