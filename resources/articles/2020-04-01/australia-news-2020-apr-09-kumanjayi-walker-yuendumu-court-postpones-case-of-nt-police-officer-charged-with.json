Constable Zachary Rolfe was charged with murder following the incident and has said he intends to plead not guilty. The matter has been postposed for 10 weeks, partly because essential reports have been delayed by the Covid-19 shutdown and partly because of the sheer size of the brief of evidence. The prosecution listed the documents still to arrive as an additional pathologist statement, urine toxicology results, an examination of items used during the treatment of Walker at Yuendumu, a biomechanics report on dealing with his \u201ccapacity to undertake particular actions, given his body position\u201d, and statements about body-worn footage and clothing. \u201cJust so you have some idea of the magnitude of it: 161 statements, 256 annexures, plus multiple body video footage,\u201d David Edwardson QC, appearing for Rolfe, told the court. \u201cAnd we know that there is certainly a great deal of further material, as has just been identified. \u201cIn my view, what I\u2019ve been told, and I\u2019m only as good as what I\u2019ve been told, 10 weeks is probably optimistic,\u201d Edwardson said. The case will go before the court on 25 June. In a separate matter, on Wednesday an NT police officer was suspended without pay for \u201cserious breaches of discipline\u201d, after he was found to have been involved in producing and distributing a singlet described as disgraceful and inappropriate. The 61-year-old man was allegedly responsible for making a singlet with the slogan \u201cDon\u2019t wanna get shot ... Don\u2019t stab a cop! ... #BlueLivesMatter\u201d. An image of the singlet was shared widely over the weekend on social media and first reported by NITV News. An investigation by the NT police professional standards command found \u201cthe officer was allegedly responsible for the production and distribution of clothing that displayed highly inappropriate content\u201d. The assistant commissioner, Michael White, said the actions of the officer were disgraceful. \u201cFor a serving officer to be involved in this behaviour brings disrepute to the entire police force and this behaviour is unacceptable. \u201cI reiterate the commissioner\u2019s apology to the community for the conduct of this member.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
