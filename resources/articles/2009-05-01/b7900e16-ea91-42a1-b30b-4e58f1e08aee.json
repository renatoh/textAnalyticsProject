He will tell a sell-out audience at the Royal Institute of British Architects' 175th anniversary celebrations in London that they should study an area's historic architecture before producing new plans and only produce buildings that fit the scale and character of the area. He will not attack individual projects for fear of sparking a controversy similar to that caused by his RIBA address in 1984 when he described plans for a modernist extension to the National Gallery as a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend\". But courtiers said his comments reflect his frustration with modernist designers who have \"explicitly rejected the past and believe that the role of the architect is to innovate and create on all occasions\". Leading architects have called for a boycott of the lecture after the prince wrote to representatives of the Qatari royal family to deride as \"unsuitable\" designs for a housing scheme at the former Chelsea barracks by the firm of Richard Rogers, who led the hi-tech movement and designed the Pompidou Centre in Paris. He will urge architects to remember they are not just designers of buildings, but are \"placemakers\" with a responsibility which can affect the public's physical and psychological wellbeing. The speech, which was trailed today by Clarence House, is expected to contain implied but serious criticisms of the architecture profession. \"The prince will remind architects about the important role they play in the world,\" a Clarence House spokeswoman said. \"He will say we need to get back to an architecture which is built to last, which puts the needs of people and the community first, consults them and is designed to fit the scale and local character of the surroundings.\" He is expected to set out a three-point plan for better buildings, which some in his circle have labelled a blueprint for \"organic architecture\". He will talk about Poundbury, his often-derided neo-Georgian village development in Dorset and say that new architecture should develop from what has worked well in the past; and he will urge architects to study and understand local architecture and refer to its scale and character in their designs. But some architects were left bemused by the prince's position, which they said reflected the fact that he has done little to engage with modern architects and understand what they are trying to achieve. Tony Fretton, one of the architects who called for a boycott of the lecture, said he felt the prince's remarks were condescending, particularly his call for architects to respect for the past.\"He seems to think that unless architects are controlled by a force of conservatism like himself, it will all go wrong and that is not the case.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
