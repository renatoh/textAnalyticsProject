Mr Qatada is fighting an attempt to send him back to Jordan, where he has been sentenced in his absence to life imprisonment for involvement in terrorist attacks dating back to 1998. Home Office lawyers told the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) that it would be \"extraordinary\" if Jordan did not comply with diplomatic assurances in a memorandum of understanding that he would not face torture or ill-treatment on his return. Ian Burnett QC, for the home secretary, said there was no real risk that Jordan's \"disciplined and accountable\" security services would breach the agreement. The deal signed with Jordan is the first of a series that the government is hoping to strike with Middle East and north African countries enabling it to deport up to 18 international terror suspects held in maximum security prisons in Britain. The Siac hearing, which is expected to last 10 days, is the first big legal test of the government's strategy. Edward Fitzgerald QC, for Mr Qatada, claimed that the national security case against him was partly based on evidence obtained by torture. A Siac judgment in March 2004 said that Mr Qatada was \"at the centre in the United Kingdom of terrorist activities associated with al-Qaida.\" But Mr Fitzgerald said Mr Qatada strongly suspected that that case was based on material obtained as a result of torture. He said that Clive Stafford Smith, the lawyer for a British detainee in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Jamil el-Banna, had made a statement alleging that his client was tortured by the US to provide information about Mr Qatada. He asked Siac to rule that any evidence obtained by torture was inadmissible in the deportation hearing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
