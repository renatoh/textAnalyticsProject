A good way to illustrate the point is with a discussion of bookings markets. When the biggest teams collide, sparks often fly. The way referees respond, however, differs between competitions. In betting, as in everything else, it is vital to understand the context in which an event is taking place. The most high-profile European football clubs are probably Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United in England, Internazionale, Juventus and Milan in Italy, Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain and perhaps Bayern Munich in Germany. In most bookings markets (10 points for each yellow card and 25 for each red), the average make-up in Premier League games between the English Big Four during the past six seasons was 47. In Serie A games between Internazionale, Juventus and Milan it was 54. In La Liga games between Barcelona and Real Madrid \u2013 the so-called El Gran Clasico \u2013 it was 75. When representatives of those countries met in the Champions League, however, make-ups were much lower, even though many took place in the knockout rounds. The average bookings make-up in Champions League games between clubs from England, Germany, Italy and Spain during the past six seasons was 40. On Tuesday, four yellow cards were issued when Villarreal played Arsenal, and the same number when Barcelona played Bayern Munich. Card counts in all-English Champions League ties have been very low. Only four yellows were issued in Moscow when Manchester United played Chelsea. Only three were issued on Wednesday when Chelsea played Liverpool at Anfield. The average bookings make-up across the 14 all-English Champions League ties has been just 25. The unmistakable conclusion is that when the biggest teams play each other on the grandest stages in the Champions League the number of yellow and red cards issued is generally lower than you might have thought. And, crucially, lower than bookmakers' odds sometimes anticipate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
