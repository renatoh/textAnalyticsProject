Is this a daring fashion statement by an eccentric individual who refuses to buy into the modern Shanghai work ethic? But as you sit in a bustling restaurant where every 10th person wandering by is in their comfies, you realise that stepping out in nightclothes is one of the most enviably relaxed customs of the city. It is also part of a way of life that is disappearing fast as Shanghai races towards business-suited modernity, and the big-family atmosphere of old neighbourhoods is replaced by the anonymity of apartment-block living. Nowhere is the pyjama culture more evident than in Fangbin Road, one of the few remaining districts in central Shanghai to have escaped the developers' wrecking balls. At night the narrow street teems with life as curious visitors mix with the pyjama-clad residents who emerge from ramshackle low-rise buildings. The locals say they treat the entire neighbourhood as an extension of their homes - natural enough, considering they share public baths and toilets. Some have towels flung over their shoulders, others are on their way to snack at rows of street stalls illuminated by naked bulbs or to play mah-jong at the local massage and leisure centre. The ultra-casual attire creates a cosy atmosphere. Zhou Ciming, a 42-year-old businessman who has popped out for a few glasses of Jinnanchu liquor and a bowl of beef jiding, explains. \"I go out in my pyjamas twice a week. It makes me feel really comfortable and relaxed. Though I wouldn't wear them outside the neighbourhood.\" But even in this informal mode, appearances matter. Zhou's wife, Gong Jianmin, says she takes extra care in selecting her husband's pyjamas because she knows they will be seen in public. The pair he is currently wearing - white cotton with a yellow and orange check pattern - cost 220 yuan renminbi (\u00a315), a sizeable sum in China. This, she explains, is his autumn and spring night outfit. He also has short-sleeved pyjamas for summer and thick quilted pyjamas for winter, as well as spare pairs for each season. Despite this extensive collection, Zhou never wears the pyjamas in bed, except in winter. \"They're really for lounging about. I prefer to sleep with no clothes on.\" As anthropologists and sociologists have observed, outdoor pyjama-wearing reflects a concept of public and private space that is very different from that of much of the west. China has a different set of inhibitions: there has long been less concern here about spitting in the street or defecating alongside a stranger. This is changing, in part because of a government campaign against \"backwardness\", in part because of the spread of global values, but largely because the residential environment is being transformed by one of the most spectacular building sprees the world has seen. Although there are still many middle-aged men and women wearing pyjamas in Fangbin Road, few of the younger generation are ready to be quite so informal. \"Young people just don't dress like this any more,\" observes Zhou. In a few years, he believes, he too will have to change his habits. The houses on Fangbin Road are to be knocked down in 2006 and the residents moved to a new high-rise apartment complex in Pudong. \"I don't think it would feel right to wear pyjamas in the new place,\" he says. \"It's a shame this custom is disappearing. It seems that as society modernises, people grow further apart from one another. But I suppose some interesting new street fashions will emerge to replace the pyjama culture.\" Jonathan Watts Mind your language Do you speak Chinglish? Almost as striking as China's economic boom is the explosion of its main language, Mandarin, with 1,000 new words and phrases entering common usage each year. That works out at three a day; three that might include, for example, shouji (mobile), anjie (mortgage) and yiyeqing (one-night stand) - all recent additions to the country's dictionaries. Most are imported from the west, and a few, like WTO, are so ubiquitous that newspapers will print them in roman script, in the midst of Chinese characters. But most are translated phonetically, or by meaning - or both. A club is ju-le-bu : pretty much as close a sound as one will get in Mandarin, and meaning \"somewhere people are happy together\". Multinationals, getting in on the act, have come up with brand names such as rei-bu (Reebok's \"fast step\") and bao-ma (BMW's \"precious horse\"). While some words have crept into common usage - no one knows quite when high-school kids derived ku from \"cool\" - others can be precisely dated. Few of the businessmen who toss around the phrase shuang ying (\"double win\") in meetings realise that it was first used on November 15 1999, when officials issuing a Sino-American joint announcement struggled to find an existing equivalent to the American \"win-win situation\". But just as the authorities seek to cool the pace of economic change, so they are trying to put the brakes on accelerating lingustic expansion. Fearing that perfectly adequate Chinese words may be usurped by dastardly intruders, they have mounted an Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise-style defence of their tongue. Youth TV presenters were recently warned to curb their use of English words. \"Our work is mainly to limit words coming in directly [not translated by meaning]. We can't stop it, but we ask the media not to use too many of them,\" says Sun Xiao, of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of Language and Literature. \"We need to keep our language pure to some extent, and anyway, sometimes they're too complicated for people to understand.\" But the complications do not end when the word has been translated. China has not one language, but many. To ensure that new coinages are written in the same way in each of them, allowing nationwide communication, officials in Beijing must constantly liaise with different regions. Alas, the perfect translation in Mandarin, the official language, can be apparently arbitrary to Cantonese or Hakka readers faced with the same characters. The bright spot for students is that the government has given up creating new characters for each new word, and now adapts the existing 11,000. \"They seemed quite enough,\" Sun observes. Of course, since English has borrowed promiscuously from Hindi (bungalow), German (zeitgeist), French (ensemble) et al, we will no doubt adopt a phrase or two from Mandarin. \"Our influence on the outside world is undoubtedly growing. So yes, it should happen,\" agrees Sun. Which is kind of ku. Tania Branigan Creature comforts Rolf Harris would love it here ... To see a dog on the Shanghai streets is unusual. To see one on a motorbike should be enough to stop traffic. Unless you are a taxi driver, in which case you hurriedly lock the doors and drive on by. That, with neat irony, is the reason Tony the golden retriever comes to be perched, Easy Rider-style, on two wheels in the first place. Tony has a sore tummy and cannot walk, so the man who owns Tony is forced to carry him. Tony is heavy, so the man - his desperate staggers into the road to hail a taxi repeatedly thwarted by the cabbies' preference for less hairy passengers - has to put him down. Unable to bend down far enough to reach the floor without dropping his best friend, he spies the row of parked motorbikes and - well, you would, wouldn't you? Not unreasonably, a small crowd quickly develops. In a city where dog soup is still a popular dish, Tony is a veritable banquet of an animal. Yet the curious onlookers are not licking their lips, but patting Tony's head. In modern-day Shanghai, a dog is for life, not just for dinnertime. Outlawed as a bourgeois practice during the 1950s Maoist heyday, pet ownership in the city has soared alongside income in recent years. \"In the past only rich people could afford to raise a dog as a pet,\" says Huang Jian, who runs the Little Sprite Pet Hospital on Wusheng Road in downtown Shanghai. \"Now many, many citizens have pets, and dogs are the most popular.\" Dogs are clear favourites because, although cats are cheaper and do not require costly registration, some traditional views towards animals remain, including the belief that felines are unclean. Rolf Harris would like it at the Little Sprite. Business is brisk and pets in pain sprawl on the treatment tables, each with an intravenous drip plugged into a poorly paw and a doleful look on its face. The hospital opened in 1998; there are now more than 30 across the city. Tony's owner (who, perhaps fearful of a taxi embargo, is reluctant to give his name) says he is happy to spend the 360 yuan (\u00a326) the hospital charged for the retriever's consultation. Next door to the clinic is a grooming room where pampered pooches are bathed and have their fur and nails trimmed. And what better to show off that new haircut than the latest collar and lead? All available from the hospital's own shop. It is, though, not a pet store. The animals on show are for display only. City officials have yet to fully endorse dog ownership, which is out of step with their vision of Shanghai as a modernising international hub for tourism and commerce. Thousands of unregistered strays are periodically rounded up from the streets and destroyed, a campaign that has gathered pace since the 2003 Sars outbreak. To discourage \"public nuisance\", it is illegal to sell canines within the bounds of the inner ring road. Except in soup, of course.
