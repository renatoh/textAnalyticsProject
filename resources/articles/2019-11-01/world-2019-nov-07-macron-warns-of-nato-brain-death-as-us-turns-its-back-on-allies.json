None. You have an uncoordinated aggressive action by another Nato ally, Turkey, in an area where our interests are at stake.\u201d Asked whether he still believed in the \u201ccollective defence\u201d stipulations of article five of Nato\u2019s founding treaty, under which an attack against one member is considered an attack against all members, Macron answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Nato \u201conly works if the guarantor of last resort functions as such. I\u2019d argue that we should reassess the reality of what Nato is in the light of the commitment of the United States,\u201d he said. Macron\u2019s questioning of Nato\u2019s effectiveness and suggestion European countries in the 29-member alliance should reassess their situation comes ahead of a key summit with leaders including Donald Trump in the UK early next month. They were met with criticism from Germany and the US, the alliance\u2019s largest member. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, stressed the importance of Nato on a visit to eastern Germany to mark 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. \u201cI think Nato remains an important, critical, perhaps historically one of the most critical, strategic partnerships in all of recorded history,\u201d Pompeo told reporters in Leipzig. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, rejected Macron\u2019s assessment, saying he had \u201cused drastic words, that [were] not my view of cooperation in Nato\u201d. Speaking after talks in Berlin with the chief of the transatlantic defence alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, Merkel said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that such sweeping judgements are necessary, even if we have problems and need to pull together.\u201d Stoltenberg said Nato was strong, and that the US and Europe were working \u201cmore together than we have done for decades\u201d. Macron had said in his interview that Washington was showing signs of \u201cturning its back on us\u201d, as demonstrated by the US president\u2019s sudden decision to pull troops out of north-eastern Syria last month without consulting his allies. The move caught Nato\u2019s leading European powers \u2013 Britain, France and Germany \u2013 by surprise and paved the way for Turkey to launch a cross-border military operation targeting Syrian Kurdish forces. Macron decried Nato\u2019s inability to react to Turkey\u2019s offensive and said it was time Europe stopped acting like a junior ally of the US when it came to the Middle East. He repeated his long-held belief the EU must develop a military force and shore up its ability to act as a political bloc with policies on technology, data and the climate emergency. \u201cLook at what is happening in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that were unthinkable five years ago \u2013 to be wearing ourselves out over Brexit, to have Europe finding it so difficult to move forward, to have an American ally turning its back on us so quickly on strategic issues \u2013 nobody would have believed this possible.\u201d He said Europe was on \u201cthe edge of a precipice. If we don\u2019t wake up \u2026 there\u2019s a considerable risk that in the long run we will disappear geopolitically, or at least that we will no longer be in control of our destiny. I believe that very deeply.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
