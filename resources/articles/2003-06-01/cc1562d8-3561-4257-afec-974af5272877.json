Mogwai's painfully marvellous 2001 LP, Rock Action, proved that the lairy Scots were head and shoulders above their peers, co-opting deceptively sweet melodies, corralling guest vocalists and confining the whole thing to a perfectly judged 39 minutes. If anything, Happy Songs For Happy People is even sweeter, a trove of tunefulness that sometimes lulls and sometimes overwhelms. Often the trick, as on Ratts of the Capital, is to gradually transpose an almost folky gentleness into a pummelling wall of guitar; in its ebb and flow, Happy Songs For Happy People is consistently hypnotic. It's not a little nostalgic, too: the lovely melody that emerges halfway through Kids Will Be Skeletons is New Order via the Cure's Disentegration, while Stop Coming To My House recalls My Bloody Valentine. Occasionally muffled vocals whisper through the noise; if they know the secrets of this majestic music, they're not telling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
