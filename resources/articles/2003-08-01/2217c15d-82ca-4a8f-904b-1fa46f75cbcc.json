The successful record attempt happened on the Scottish city's Royal Mile as part of Kabosh theatre company's promotions for its production of Rhinoceros, part of the Fringe festival. At the first attempt, 12 people crammed into the phone box, only equalling the record, which was set in Germany in 1997. But a second attempt saw 14 people, including two children, squeeze into the box over a 10-minute spell. Volunteers in the record-breaking stunt included 52-year-old Edinburgh resident Jimmy Robertson, who said: \"It was very tight, but everyone was there just because they wanted to make it happen.\" \u00b7 A nervy lizard at Singapore's Zoological Gardens is feeling a whole lot calmer after undergoing acupuncture treatment. Unhappy Komodo dragon lizard Tirto had been experiencing difficulties eating and swallowing, and baffled staff turned to acupuncturist and vet Oh Soon Hock after steroid treatment failed. The eight-year-old lizard is being treated twice a week, and zoo spokesman Vincent Tan said: \"Tirto is now more relaxed, and is beginning to enjoy his treatments.\" Komodo dragons are the world's largest lizards, and can grow up to 10 feet long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
