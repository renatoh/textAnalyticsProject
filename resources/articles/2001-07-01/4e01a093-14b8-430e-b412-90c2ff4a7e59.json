MP David Curry told the House of Commons the age limit must be scrapped and regulations governing pensions savings should be more flexible. He said at the moment pensioners are prevented from taking control of their investments. The Financial Services Authority, the main City watchdog, also said this week it was concerned about how older people maintained a decent income in retirement. It said the sale of annuities would be included in the wide ranging review. Under current rules, workers who retire commonly use their pension funds to buy a regular income called an annuity. Most people buy the annuity product on offer from their life insurer when they reach retirement age, despite rules that allow them to shop around for better rates and different kinds of products. They are also allowed to put off the day when they buy an annuity until they are 75. Up to that point they can keep their money invested in the stock market and use products such as \"income drawdown\" in the search for a higher income. Annuity rates have been falling dramatically in recent years. Falling long-term interest rates coupled with dramatic rises in life expectancy have forced down the amount pensioners are allocated. Mr Curry pointed to the recent Equitable Life scandal, which he said emphasised the unexpected risks and anxiety caused by the current annuity regime. Equitable has not only cut the terminal bonuses for policyholders but also the income paid to 65,000 with-profit annuity holders. \"I know from my constituency mailbag this is an important issue for many people who are locked into the current regime.\" Referring to annuities that cannot be passed on to spouses, he said: \"The situation disadvantages pensioners' families and benefits only those companies which have sold an annuity and no longer have to pay out any income.\" Mr Curry is supported by the Retirement Income Reform Group, which has campaigned for a review of rules that force pensioners to buy an annuity when they reach 75. Oonagh MacDonald, the former Labour MP and director of the group, says Mr Curry's private member's bill would be welcomed by millions of people who are put off saving money in a pension scheme only to find they end up with a miserable annuity. She believes that pensioners should be allowed to carry on investing their money for the rest of their life and use other products to draw an income. Ministers have so far proved reluctant to change the law. They argue that only a few affluent savers, largely in the south east, save enough in their pension to be concerned about the issue. Work and pensions minister Alistair Darling is known to believe that with most individual pension pots amounting to no more than \u00a375,000, which translates into an annuity of \u00a35,000-\u00a36,000 a year, pensioners should be forced buy an annuity or otherwise they could spend it and eventually demand state benefits. Tom McPhail of financial adviser Torquil Clark says while it may be true that most private pension funds are small, there has been an explosion in pension sales in the past 12 years. \"There is a clear disincentive for young people to save for their retirement when they cannot take ownership of their funds. If they changed the rules there would be a significant impact on the sales of stakeholder pensions. Young people are concerned they will save for 40 years and then a life assurance firm comes along, takes it off them and gives a paltry income in return.\" Mr Curry says his proposals will get round ministers' concerns because pensioners will be forced to buy an index-linked annuity to push their income above benefit levels. Once a minimum retirement income has been set, pensioners should have complete investment flexibility, he says. Know what to look for The first thing that anybody coming up to retirement age must decide is whether to accept the offer from their life insurance company to translate their pension fund into an annuity. Anyone can put off the day they purchase an annuity until they are 75, so you may want to avoid them altogether. Tom McPhail of financial adviser Torquil Clark says anyone with a pension pot of \u00a375,000-plus should consider keeping their investments in equities rather than switching straight to an annuity. If the decision is to go for an annuity, buying from your existing life insurer is nearly always the wrong decision. Shopping around is essential and can nearly always result in a better deal. Remember, opting for one annuity over another is a decision you are stuck with for life. But before shopping around, consider the many different types of annuity. Standard annuities offer a simple deal between you and a life insurance company to exchange a pension fund built up by you over many years for a yearly income for the rest of your life. The life insurer will allow you to take the same sum each year or index link it to inflation or some other measure. But all that happens is that you get less at the beginning of the policy and more at the end. Rates have fallen dramatically in recent years which means that the annual income of pensioners has dropped considerably as life companies expect you to live longer and get lower investment returns from the stock market. A 65-year-old man retiring 10 years ago with a pension pot of \u00a350,000 could expect a pension of \u00a37,000, which they could add to their state pension. Now that figure has declined to \u00a34,500. People saving today fare even worse. A 35- year-old man needs to save about \u00a3350 a month to achieve a pension of \u00a310,000. Go back 10 years and \u00a3150 was on track to get you the same annuity. With-profit annuities, popular at Equitable Life, payout depending on the performance of the with-profits fund. At Equitable the with-profits fund has been slashed. The Financial Services Authority is planning to look at these products to see if they should carry a serious health warning. Unit-linked annuities payout based on the performance of a collection of investments, like a unit trust. Unfortunately, monthly payments can vary depending on the performance of the investments. Impaired life annuities are targeted at people who have severe medical conditions or have pastimes, like smoking, that are life threatening. They can get higher rates because the life insurer believes they will die earlier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
