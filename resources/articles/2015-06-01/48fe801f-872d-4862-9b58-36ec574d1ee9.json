Twenty years ago it was considered a death sentence; even today the condition \u2013 which affects around 6,500 people in the UK \u2013 is considered debilitating and life-limiting. However, thanks to the team of doctors and scientists involved in treating Archie, it is hoped that a drug which could block the disease\u2019s progress could be developed in a few years. Writing in Nature Medicine last week, the group \u2013led by Professor Nick Morrell of Cambridge University and funded by the British Heart Foundation \u2013 reveal that they have pinpointed a protein that circulates in the bloodstream and plays a crucial role in ensuring our lungs\u2019 blood vessels are healthy. \u201cWe have discovered that patients suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension don\u2019t make enough of this protein, which is known as BMP9,\u201d Morrell told the Observer. \u201cWe have carried out tests that indicate that the protein, which is relatively easy to manufacture, could restore blood vessels in patients\u2019 lungs to a healthy condition.\u201d Pulmonary arterial hypertension is caused by a narrowing of the blood vessels that lead from the heart to the lungs. When these arteries narrow, it becomes harder and harder for the heart to pump blood through to a person\u2019s lungs. This disrupted blood flow leads to major health problems. Current treatments only target the symptoms and the prognosis remains poor; the only long-term treatment is a lung transplant or a heart-and-lung transplant. \u201cThe trouble is there is a very limited supply of donated heart and lung combinations, particularly for children, and the survival rate for those who get transplants is about 50% after five years,\u201d added Morrell. The nightmare facing PAH patients, particularly those who develop the disease in their early years, is demonstrated by the story of Archie, who lives in the Cotswolds with his parents, Jamie and Julia. After his diagnosis, his condition deteriorated rapidly and he had to be treated with 24-hour intravenous medicine to alleviate his symptoms. \u201cHe was fitted with a device that could continually administer his medicine, which was stored in a little back pack,\u201d said Julia. However, Archie\u2019s condition worsened and he eventually underwent an operation to allow more blood to get round his body. But the blood now contains much less oxygen, and this could lead to organ failure in later life. Morrell\u2019s work suggests there is hope that Archie\u2019s prospects could improve. \u201cThe protein we have identified \u2013 BMP9 \u2013 is crucially for keeping the lining of blood vessels in the lung in a healthy condition,\u201d he said. \u201cIn proper quantities, it prevents arterial cells from leaking or dying off. Without enough of it, blood vessels in the lungs narrow and become misshapen and blood cannot get through. This forces the heart to work harder and harder \u2013 until it fails. Raising levels of BMP9 in patients\u2019 blood should get round that problem.\u201d In animal tests BMP9 didn\u2019t only prevent pulmonary arteries from becoming narrow, it restored already damaged blood vessels. \u201cWe hope that will be the case with humans,\u201d said Morrell. Phase-one safety tests of BMP9 should start within the next year and should lead to phase-two efficacy trials within two or three years, he added. \u201cA key feature of BMP9 is that it is made in the human body and so should not trigger immune reactions. Certainly we are hopeful.\u201d Professor Jeremy Pearson of the British Heart Foundation added: \u201cThese findings offer real promise of a cure. They could be a game-changer.\u201d Archie\u2019s parents have set up their own charity, the Dinosaur Trust \u2013 reflecting Archie\u2019s love of dinosaurs \u2013 to raise funds for research. \u201cIt is impossible to explain the pain we have gone through since Archie\u2019s diagnosis, but now we have this light at the end of the tunnel, and that is wonderful.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
