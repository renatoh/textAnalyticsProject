The Green Party yesterday nominated Jenny Jones, one of its three London Assembly members, to take up the post in June under a controversial deal to rotate the post between political parties. Nicknamed \"screaming Jenny Jones\" by her political opponents, she intends to oppose airport expansion, roadbuilding and globalisation. The Greens say she is entitled to the job under the terms of an offer from mayor Ken Livingstone to switch it between rival parties in the Assembly. Shortly after he was elected in 2000, Mr Livingstone appointed Labour's Nicky Gavron as his second-in-command but promised that each year, a different group would fill the job. A year later, however, he decided not to allow the Conservatives to nominate a candidate on the grounds that they would be too disruptive. The Liberal Democrats decided not to fill the post last year. In October, addressing Green Party members, Mr Livingstone reaffirmed his intention to allow the Greens to fill the job this year, saying: \"I do intend to honour the commitment I gave, that there should be a Green deputy mayor for one of the four years and we're coming up to that.\" The Greens were initially split on whether to accept the job. But delegates from across London met on Monday night and voted to put forward Ms Jones. Ms Jones is a recent entrant to politics. She previously spent ten years as an archeologist in the Middle East, specialising in analysing ancient bird droppings. She said yesterday: \"As deputy mayor I will promote the expansion of the congestion charging area, protection of green space and developing renewable energy in London. \"As the first Green deputy mayor I look forward to using my position to generate public debate about a wider green vision for London.\" The post of deputy mayor carries few formal duties, other than to carry out work under the instruction of the mayor. Over the last three years, Ms Gavron has become a close ally of Mr Livingstone, recently brokering a deal with the government over control of the London Underground. However, she is standing against Mr Livingstone as Labour candidate in next year's mayoral election. The mayor's office was tight-lipped on Ms Green's nomination. A spokeswoman said the position of deputy mayor was \"a decision which doesn't have to be taken until May\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
