He did so having just been impeached and in a presidential election year where his base is in part powered by the religious right. His presence ensured it was hard to tell where the march ended and where a Trump rally began. Street vendors sold \u201cBabies Lives Matter\u201d T-shirts side by side with \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and \u201cTrump 2020: Keep America Great\u201d caps. Trump badges and March for Life badges were cheek by jowl. One vendor pushed a cart with T-shirts that depicted the president urinating on a CNN logo. In a crowd thousands strong, numerous people, including university and school students who had been bussed in, wore Trump regalia or carried red signs that said: \u201cMost pro-life president ever.\u201d One waved a giant blue flag that proclaimed: \u201cTrump 2020. No more bullshit.\u201d The warm-up music, too, resembled a Trump campaign rally: the Rolling Stones\u2019 Play with Fire, Tina Turner\u2019s Simply the Best, and the Animals\u2019 House of the Rising Sun. As ever, the president walked on stage to God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood and departed to the Stones\u2019 You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want. Trump spoke on the National Mall, within view of the Capitol, where day after day Democrats are presenting damning evidence that he sought help from a foreign government to boost his chances of re-election, warranting his removal from office. But in a speech strewn with incendiary claims and downright lies, he sought to cement a crucial part of his electoral base. The president said his administration has acted to protect religious liberty and preserve faith-based adoption and has confirmed 187 federal judges, \u201cwho apply the constitution as written\u201d, including two supreme court justices. \u201cWe are protecting pro-life students\u2019 right to free speech on college campuses,\u201d he said to applause, threatening: \u201cAnd if universities want federal taxpayer dollars, then they must uphold your first amendment right to speak your mind. And if they don\u2019t, they pay a very big financial penalty, which they will not be willing to pay. \u201cSadly, the far left is actively working to erase our God-given rights, shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square, and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life. They are coming after me because I am fighting for you and we are fighting for those who have no voice. And we will win because we know how to win.\u201d Supporters chanted: \u201cFour more years! Four more years! Four more years!\u201d The president then went on the attack against Democrats for embracing \u201cradical and extreme positions\u201d on abortion over years, decades and \u201cyou could even say for centuries\u201d. Trump claimed: \u201cNearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion, all the way up until the moment of birth.\u201d It was a spurious assertion but the crowd booed. Trump claimed: \u201cLast year, lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb right up until delivery.\u201d It was a spurious assertion but the crowd booed. Trump claimed: \u201cAnd we love the Commonwealth of Virginia, but what is going on in Virginia? What is going on? The governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth.\u201d It was a spurious assertion but the crowd booed. Trump has made the same wrong claim about Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, several times before. The Politifact website judged it false, noting: \u201cNortham, a physician, never said he would sanction the execution of newborns. What he did say during a radio interview is that in rare, late-pregnancy cases when fetuses are nonviable, doctors deliver the baby, keep it comfortable, resuscitate it if the mother wishes, and then have a \u2018discussion\u2019 with the mother.\u201d None of this seemed to trouble organizers of the 47th March for Life, which billed itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest human rights rally\u201d and declared a mission to \u201cmake abortion unthinkable\u201d. On the contrary, many were evidently delighted by their star guest\u2019s turn and despite the fact that polling has consistently revealed for decades widespread public support for abortion rights. Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, told the crowd: \u201cI don\u2019t think anything will surpass those wonderful remarks that we just heard.\u201d As the president spoke, a young boy sat on a steel fence chomping an apple and sporting a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. Nearby, a 17-year-old, who gave his name only as Lucian, wore a similar hat and said: \u201cI\u2019m very excited the president is here: the first time in 47 years. He\u2019s done some good things, like tax cuts and being here, and some bad things. I would vote for him.\u201d Nancy Weber, 57, had set off from St Charles, Illinois, at 4pm on Thursday, driven for 15 hours and not slept. With her sons, Joseph, 21, and 19-year-old Jacob, she held up a giant sign that said: \u201cThank you President Trump.\u201d Weber explained: \u201cHe\u2019s made the anniversary of Roe v Wade a day of celebrating life instead. We just love the way he is present on the pro-life issue.\u201d She dismissed the impeachment trial as \u201ca hoax\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d and said she would vote for Trump again. But other attendees were less sure. Rebecca Jones, 53, a children\u2019s storyteller from Seaford, Delaware, was holding a blue sign that said \u201cPro-life is pro-woman\u201d and had the image of stork flying with a baby in a sling. \u201cOn December 19, 1990, I had an abortion in England,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s something I regret to this day. I shoved it into the recesses of everything and it came out in an ugly way. I suffered from it emotionally and physically. This is my first time here: I decided I\u2019ve got to stand up and say something. I am pro-life because I know what death brought to my life.\u201d When she learned that Trump was coming to the march, Jones said, she thought: \u201cOh, please don\u2019t turn the life movement into a political stomping ground.\u201d Jones voted for an independent candidate in 2016 and remains undecided about Trump this year. \u201cI like that he\u2019s pro-life. I don\u2019t like that he twitters all the time. I wish he could be a little more restrained in how he deals with people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
