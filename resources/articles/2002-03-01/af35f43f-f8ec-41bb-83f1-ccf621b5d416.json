It wants to slash \u00a364m a year off its payments to the league after being plunged into a financial crisis that threatens several football clubs and the future of the ITV Sport channel. ITV claims it needs to renegotiate the payments to keep the business afloat after committing to pay \u00a3315m over three years at the height of TV football auction frenzy two years ago. But the Nationwide League bosses say at least one third of the 72 football clubs in the league would go bust if the payments were not received, according to today's London Evening Standard. Critics of ITV believe it is calling \"the biggest bluffs of its life\" and say the league is right to resist calls for drastic renegotiation. And they say \u00a325m a year is a derisory offer. Earlier today the Granada chairman, Steve Morrison, said the broadcaster would close the channel if it did not get what it wanted. It is understood Granada and its partner, Carlton TV, the co-owner of ITV Digital, are prepared to close ITV Sport and go to court to save the money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
