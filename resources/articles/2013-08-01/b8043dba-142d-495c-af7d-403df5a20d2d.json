The National Federation of SubPostmasters (NFSP) said the vast majority of its members were against the privatisation and warned the sale could be catastrophic for the Post Office network. Post Office managers, with the support of the department for Business, Innovations and Skills, are expected to contact several thousand Post Offices this week asking them to stock materials on how the public can buy shares. The government is expected to offer the public the chance to buy shares directly from them or through stockbrokers at the flotation in March 2014 and is handing 10% to Royal Mail staff. However, staff running Post Offices, which rely on a third of their income from sales of Royal Mail products, are concerned that the flotation could lead to heavy cuts and mass closures. NFSP general secretary George Thomson said: \"I am surprised and angered by Post Office Ltd's request for subpostmasters to act against their own interests by encouraging the public to back the sale by buying shares. \"I know how tough our members are finding it to keep their Post Offices open due to cuts in their pay and the withdrawal of key services, and the payment which Post Office Ltd will offer for stocking these materials may be appeal ing. However, I am confident members will support our call not to stock the share prospectus.\" A Post Office Ltd spokeswoman said: \"This is a matter for government and no decisions have been made yet [over stocking the prospectuses and materials].\" The Communication Workers Union, which represents most of Royal Mail's 150,000 staff and is also fiercely opposed to privatisation, has said that if a sale does proceed it would consider trying to create a workers' trust to control their 10% stake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
