Payments of $7,500 were made to the political party by the guild\u2019s Queensland branch in June and July. In March, the branch made a $1,450 donation to Katter\u2019s Australian party. While the guild has also made donations to Labor, the Liberals and the Nationals, no donations have been made to the Queensland Greens. Hanson has previously made controversial comments about vaccination. Last week a secretly filmed al-Jazeera documentary showed senior One Nation figures meeting with the National Rifle Association in the United States and discussing ways to roll back Australia\u2019s strict gun laws. A spokesman for the guild, Greg Turnbull, did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about how guild members had responded to the donations. He said: \u201cThe Pharmacy Guild attends paid political events and functions across the political spectrum, with all such payments to attend events reported and declared to electoral regulators and published by them. \u201cAttendance at political events by guild officials does not denote endorsement of policies of the host party.\u201d But Dr Sajni Gudka, a former pharmacist who complained about the donation on a Facebook page for early career pharmacists, said he did not accept the explanation. \u201cAccording to me donations are mindful, deliberative activity,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cOne decides where and when and how much to donate.\u201d Gudka posted on Facebook that \u201csurely there\u2019s a line\u201d. \u201cWould the guild attend a function for, say, Fraser Anning\u2019s party?\u201d The president of the Victorian branch of the Pharmacy Guild, Anthony Tassone, responded that \u201cThe guild continuously considers and reviews its donations to political parties\u201d. Tassone justified the donation to One Nation by saying the payments were \u201cmade last year and well before the latest reported events in the media\u201d. While the guild would not comment on the response to the donation from members, online, people shared their disgust. The vice-president of Professional Pharmacists Australia, Carmel McCallum, said; \u201cThe Pharmacy Guild doesn\u2019t speak for pharmacists \u2013 we are proud of our diversity \u2026 we condemn One Nation and its policies\u201d. Someone else wrote on Twitter; \u201cI\u2019m disgusted - I will be cancelling all my memberships\u201d. Another person wrote; \u201cI\u2019m a hospital pharmacist and beyond appalled. We all know the Guild is an effective lobbying organisation, but I thought they had SOME ethics. Clearly nowhere they will not go\u201d. Associate professor Ken Harvey, a campaigner for accurate medical labelling and public health physician, said \u201cthe guild wishes to back any horse that might serve its self-interested agenda\u201d. \u201cI presume their strategy of donating to One Nation, along with Labor and the Coalition, is to ensure their patch continues to be protected by all, that competition from supermarkets will not eventuate and plans to allow patients greater quantities of medication each time they visited a chemist can be torpedoed yet again,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the pharmacy professional body, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, has come out against pharmacists stocking non-evidence-based products such as homeopathy, the guild resists; there\u2019s money to be made in pills with no active ingredients.\u201d \u2022 Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
