Yep. Like a fidget spinner.\u201d Welcome to another of the comedian Rich Hall\u2019s masterly television essays in which he ponders, drily but illuminatingly, a facet of recent US history. The gadget in question was a nuclear bomb. And Hall\u2019s subject this time is the cold war and its series of frequently comical cultural battles \u2013 which barely disguised the deadly serious purpose underpinning them. It\u2019s a delight from start to finish; as ever, Hall combines wit, warmth and erudition to persuasive effect. Phil Harrison MasterChef: The Professionals 8pm, BBC Two Another run of the entertaining high-end cookery contest. The culinary odysseys will become bewilderingly complex in the weeks ahead, but we begin with a simple skills test: can our sweaty-palmed chefs knock up a ragu under the beady eyes of judges Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti? PH The Pride of Britain Awards 2019 8pm, ITV This award show is as glitzy as any other, only here it\u2019s the celebs who sing the praises of unsung \u201cordinary\u201d heroes. This year\u2019s double celebration marks the event\u2019s 20th anniversary, so we\u2019ll be revisiting memorable past recipients as well as hearing stories of selflessness and courage. Ellen E Jones Dublin Murders 9pm, BBC One Finale of the overly twisty psychological crime thriller based on Tana French\u2019s novels, and it is interrogations all round as the investigation into Katy\u2019s murder concludes. With loose ends tied up, Rob and Cassie reunite \u2013 but will it be a happy ending for Ireland\u2019s most unlucky detective duo? Hannah J Davies Rick Stein\u2019s Secret France 9pm, BBC Two Another jaunt for Stein, who \u2013 as the BBC\u2019s designated gastronomic wanderer \u2013 has the best job on television. Tonight\u2019s Gallic gushing includes a stroll through Dieppe and a convincing argument for the supremacy of one-star Michelin restaurants over two- and three-star ones. Nice work, if you can get it. PH Love and Hate Crime 10.35pm, BBC One This documentary series about US hate crimes continues with the case of Onesimo Lopez-Ramos, a young Guatemalan killed near Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate. The defendant\u2019s lawyer is initially confident of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict, but a late-in-the-tail twist changes everything. EEJ Film choice The Wolf of Wall Street, 9pm, Film4 Martin Scorsese has a high old time of it, revelling in the debauchery of Wall Street\u2019s crack-and-sex-addled stockbroking princes, as described in the memoir of trader (and later, convict) Jordan Belfort. It\u2019s done with great skill and fizzing energy, with Leonardo DiCaprio exerting all his star appeal.
