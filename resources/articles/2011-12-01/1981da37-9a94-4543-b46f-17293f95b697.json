In one tweet that derided Samir Nasri over his decision to swap Arsenal for Manchester City, Emmanuel Frimpong did more than forge new linguistic frontiers. Which is a speciality of his, incidentally. The 19-year-old midfield firebrand advertised his streetwise confidence and his refusal to bow to reputations. Anyone who watched him tear a strip off Andrey Arshavin, Arsenal's seasoned Russia international, for not tracking back in the win against Swansea City in September would have had the impression reinforced. It was only Frimpong's fifth appearance for the club. And last week there was the tunnel bust-up with Nasri after the Carling Cup defeat by City. Frimpong is a young man in a headlong hurry to impose himself. Perhaps there is the desire to make up for lost time, after he missed virtually the whole of last season with cruciate knee ligament damage, which delayed his first-team introduction. There is a raw energy and intensity to his game and he stepped over the line on his full Premier League debut against Liverpool when he was sent off for two late tackles. He recognised that he cost his team that day and, in the hothouse of Olympiakos's Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium, he will be presented with the latest staging post in his development. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will start him in an experimental XI, having earned the right to rest his established stars, as history has repeated itself in the Champions League. In 2009-10 Arsenal visited Olympiakos in their final group tie in an unassailable position and they have once again travelled here assured of advancing to the last 16 as group winners. In December 2009, in what became known as 'The Tom Cruise Game' because of Wenger's selection of the left-back with the Hollywood name \u2013 whatever happened to him? \u2013 the manager named the youngest team in the competition's history. They lost 1-0, a result that allowed Olympiakos to confirm their qualification. This time out, the Greek club need a positive result in order to stand a chance of overhauling second-placed Marseille, who play at Borussia Dortmund. A pulsating atmosphere is guaranteed. Frimpong will not be the only young gun desperate to impress. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is set to start on the right wing and Wenger's travelling party also included Ignasi Miquel, Nico Yennaris, Francis Coquelin, Craig Eastmond and Oguzhan Ozyakup. \"When I got my injury last season, I thought I would never get my chance for Arsenal,\" Frimpong said. \"I thought players like [Abou] Diaby, [Alex] Song and [Aaron] Ramsey would all be back from their injuries before me. But you cannot predict anything in football. I just have to keep trying to force the issue.\" It will be a test of temperament for Frimpong as much as anything else; an opportunity for him to show his strength of character, which was forged in a tough neighbourhood in Tottenham, to where his family emigrated in 2000 from Ghana. Frimpong, who played for Broadwater Farm FC, from where he was recommended to Wenger, aged 11, was born in Ghana and his pride at his roots has seen him declare for them, despite having represented England at Under-16 and Under-17 levels. Stuart Pearce phoned him at the beginning of the season and said that he wanted to call him up to the England Under-21 squad; there was the implicit promise of a chance. But Frimpong made it clear that he had decided to pledge his allegiance to Ghana. He could yet feature at next month's Africa Cup of Nations. The Twitter put-down of Nasri followed his team\u2011mate Jack Wilshere paying a personal tribute to the departed France midfielder. \"Pffffff comeon Jack,\" Frimpong wrote. On his page, he also talks of \"Frimponging\" people, his friendship with the rapper Lethal Bizzle and his buzzword, Dench. In many ways, he is the typical London lad but his talent has set him apart. He was a big noise in junior football, where his imposing reputation invariably preceded him and he is now determined for it to do likewise at senior level. This tie is anything but dead for him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
