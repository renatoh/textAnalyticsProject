For 7-1 Where Or When's trainer, Terry Mills, it was the realisation of a dream. Looking overwhelmed by the moment, Mills said: 'I haven't slept for three nights and my heart is thumping. This horse is a monster, a monster. I haven't seen anything like him on the gallops at Epsom in the 15 years I've been there. I can die a happy man now.' Asked whether he would be sending Where Or When to the Breeders' Cup, Mills said that he would consult his son Robert, who takes over from his father next year. Where Or When's owner, bookmaker John Humphreys, was asked whether it was better than Catford dogs, where he stands as a layer. 'Just a bit,' he replied. Hawk Wing's pacemaker, Sholokhov soon opened up a long lead, chased by Best Of The Bests, and lasted until his more illustrious stablemate took over one-and-a-half furlongs out but it was not for long. Almost immediately, Where Or When challenged and soon stretched clear for a two-length win. Tillerman, who beat Where Or When in controversial circumstances at Goodwood last time, was three lengths away third. Robert Mills was anxious to know the time and at 1min 41.37, it did not compare favourably with the two-year-old events earlier on the card but I doubt he and his father will be worried about that. The forlorn connections of 2-1 on Hawk Wing tried to put a brave face on it but Aidan O'Brien was visibly upset. His comments that 'I thought he ran well. We're not disappointed as he's run a really big race,' did not really ring true. This was the horse that was supposed to be the monster. With the benefit of hindsight, O'Brien must have wished he had run Rock Of Gibraltar who has beaten Where Or When three times already but was asked only to work over a mile after racing rather than run in the big race. There are more than 10,000 members of the Elite Racing Club who enjoyed by far their biggest success when Soviet Song landed the Group One Meon Valley Stud Fillies' Mile by a length and a half under Oscar Urbina. This was also the biggest winner for the Spanish jockey, who has had a good time this season with James Fanshawe's horses in sparkling form. But Fanshawe revealed that at one stage he could offer Urbina no encouragement, saying: 'A couple of years ago I didn't want him back but he's stuck at it and worked at it.' Urbina likes nothing better than holding a horse up for a late burst and in Soviet Song he has the perfect partner. The filly received a quote of 10-1 from Ladbrokes for next year's 1,000 Guineas but one cloud on the horizon is her tendency to get a little worked up in the preliminaries. Fanshawe was relieved that he was allowed to saddle her in the stableyard although she was still sweating a little in the paddock and free to post Al Jadeed won the Hackney Empire Royal Lodge Stakes by a head from Bahamian Dancer under Richard Hills after an exciting duel in a time fractionally faster than Soviet Song. Hills was narrowly foiled in his bid for a second Group Two for Hamdan Al Maktoum when Malhub was caught close home by Crystal Castle in the Brunswick Diadem Stakes. As Malhub set sail for home a furlong out it looked as though he could not be caught but Kieren Fallon produced the ride of the day to get the French-trained horse home by a short head."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
