The comic was speaking on Friday\u2019s edition of his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, which regularly tops the iTunes chart for downloads. Rogan has nearly 6m Twitter followers, regularly appears on television as a commentator on mixed martial arts, and is seen as an influential voice with young and blue-collar male voters. During a conversation with guest Eric Weinstein, managing director of Thiel Capital, talk turned to the election. Weinstein, who works for the Trump-supporting tech mogul Peter Thiel, said he would not vote for Trump or Biden, the probable challenger in November. Rogan, who has endorsed Bernie Sanders, said the party had made \u201cmorons\u201d out of voters by appearing to favour Biden. \u201cI\u2019d rather vote for Trump than [Biden],\u201d said Rogan. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Biden] can handle anything. You\u2019re relying entirely on his cabinet. If you want to talk about an individual leader who can communicate, he can\u2019t do that. And we don\u2019t know what the fuck he\u2019ll be like after a year in office. \u201cThe pressure of being president of the United States is something that no one has ever prepared for. The only one who seems to be fine with it is Trump, oddly enough.\u201d The president is 73 but Rogan said: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be aging at all or in any sort of decline. Obama, almost immediately, started looking older. George W [Bush], almost immediately, started looking older.\u201d Biden will be 78 in November. Describing the former US senator as \u201cvery old\u201d, Rogan said Biden\u2019s famous verbal slip-ups were \u201cnot a normal way to communicate unless he\u2019s high\u201d. Sanders, who took an early lead in the delegate race before losing a string of contests to Biden, is a year older than the former VP. Sanders has \u201cbeen insanely consistent his entire life\u201d, Rogan said in January, unveiling his endorsement of the independent Vermont senator, a self-described democratic socialist. \u201cHe\u2019s basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing for his whole life. And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.\u201d Rogan has made many controversial statements. In January the president of the Human Rights Campaign said then Sanders should reconsider accepting Rogan\u2019s endorsement, because the podcaster had \u201cattacked transgender people, gay men, women, people of colour and countless marginalised groups at every opportunity\u201d. A Sanders spokeswoman said: \u201cSharing a big tent requires including those who do not share every one of our beliefs, while always making clear that we will never compromise our values.\u201d Writing for the Guardian, Jacobin magazine editor Bhaskar Sunkara said the Rogan endorsement was \u201cthe best endorsement Bernie Sanders could hope for\u201d, as Rogan\u2019s \u201cfans are a group of people we can\u2019t afford to cede to Trump\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
