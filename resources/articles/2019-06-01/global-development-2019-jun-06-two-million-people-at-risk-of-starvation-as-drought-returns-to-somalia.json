Mark Lowcock, the UN\u2019s humanitarian chief, said the country is facing one of the driest rainy seasons in more than three decades, and a \u201crapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation\u201d. By September, 2.2 million people will face hunger so severe that it threatens their lives or livelihoods. A further 3.2 million people \u2013 around one-fifth of Somalia\u2019s population \u2013 will be uncertain of their next meal. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t a rapid response, there\u2019s going to be a big problem,\u201d said Lowcock. Last week, the UN warned that, rather than ramping up work, agencies had been forced to cut back in some areas because the humanitarian appeal for Somalia was so poorly funded. The crisis comes as communities struggle to recover from a two-year drought that ended in 2017. \u201cWe were caught by surprise at just how quickly this drought has returned,\u201d said Nasra Ismail, director of the Somalia NGO Consortium. \u201cThe time for people to recover has been halved and has been continuing to decrease every single season,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s climate crisis.\u201d The April to June period, initially forecast as an average rainy season, is now thought to be one of the driest on record in more than 35 years. The failed rainy season was partly caused by cyclones in the southern Indian Ocean, including Cyclone Idai in March, which stopped rains from moving north. This has come on top of abnormally hot and dry conditions between January and March, and a poor \u201cdeyr\u201d season, between October and December last year. While there has been some rainfall in recent weeks, it is still well below what is needed, leading to the devastation of crops and death of livestock. Lowcock said agencies faced a severe lack of funding, but that intervening early would avert the worst human suffering and prove more cost-effective. The humanitarian response plan, which sought $1.08bn (\u00a3848m) for the year, had received only a fifth of this amount by the end of May. The appeal has since been replaced by a drought response plan, for which $710m is being sought. The UN has allocated $45m to offer support in Somalia, as well as parts of Ethiopia and Kenya. The majority of the funds, $30m, will go to Somalia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
