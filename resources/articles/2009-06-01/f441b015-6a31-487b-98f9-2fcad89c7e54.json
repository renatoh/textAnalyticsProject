The sport signalled its intention to crack down on match fixing when appointing Jeff Rees from cricket's Anti-Corruption Unit to head the TIU in January. Rees is one of the world's leading sporting-integrity experts and recruited his former ACU and Scotland Yard colleague, Bruce Ewan, this year. Rees was the co-author of the Review of Integrity in Tennis on the basis of which the TIU was formed. But in that document he recommended nine operatives be hired for the unit. Rees identified a requirement for a director, a head of intelligence, an administrator, a betting analyst, an intelligence analyst, two investigators, a general manager, and an information manager. Yet the recruitment process has stalled six months into the TIU's operation with only two employees. Cricket sources say Rees is used to conducting \"a lot of work on intelligence in the months leading up to an event, with an awareness of individuals in the legal and illegal betting industries and knowing what their movements are\". How Rees and Ewan are able to do so on current resources is far from clear. Since both the men's and women's tours are part-owned by the players themselves, there is surprise that the sport has not worked harder to avoid any perceptions of a conflict of interest on tackling corruption. An International Tennis Federation spokesman did not return calls. Costume drama Since Sania Mirza was in line for a \u00a39,000 payday, straight-sets defeat to Sorana Cristea yesterday was hardly going to have the shirt off her back. However, this week Mirza had already taken Cristea's. The pair are best pals on tour, and when Mirza arrived in SW19 without enough clothes, the Romanian 28th seed obliged with a garment loan. Lost leader The Women's Tennis Association still does not know who will succeed Larry Scott as its chairman and chief executive even though he will quit the organisation next week. Scott appointed Korn/Ferry International to headhunt his replacement. But with no decision made the WTA is left with the unsatisfactory situation of both internal candidates \u2013 the chief operating officer, David Shoemaker, and president, Stacey Allaster \u2013 sharinghaving to share the chairman and CEO's duties despite their rivalry. Doorstep challenge Andy Murray has formally joined the ranks of A-list sporting celebrity, to the extent that his family has stepped in to warn off paparazzi photographers taking an interest in his new home. The British No1 has moved house in recent months and the unwelcome attentions of long-lens photographers had disturbed Murray's girlfriend, Kim Sears, prompting the family to make a formal complaint to the press ombudsman. Royal appointment? She has not been seen at Centre Court since 1977, when Virginia Wade lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish, but intriguingly the Queen has nothing in her diary for Sunday 5 July. That is the day Andy Murray hopes to become the first Briton to contest a Wimbledon men's final since 1938. \"The Queen supports all British and Commonwealth sportspeople in any discipline,\" said a spokesman. However, she was nowhere to be seen when Lleyton Hewitt won here in 2002. Food for thought Wayne Odesnik, the man at the centre of a betting-integrity investigation, admits to having dinner at O'Neill's pub in Earl's Court on the night before his controversial straight-sets defeat to J\u00fcrgen Melzer on Tuesday. A glance at the menu shows a selection of salads was available. But if he overlooked them in favour of the Guinness-battered fish and chips with mushy peas, the all-day Irish breakfast or the pies, chips and gravy, fellow patrons might account for some of the hundreds of thousands of pounds backing Melzer to win 3\u20130."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
