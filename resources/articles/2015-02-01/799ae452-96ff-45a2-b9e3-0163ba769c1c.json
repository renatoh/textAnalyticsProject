Key to their transformation since the beleaguered days of November has been Brendan Rodgers\u2019 switch to a 3-4-2-1 formation plus the emergence of several summer signings following an inauspicious start, Emre Can and Lazar Markovic chief among them. Criticism of Liverpool\u2019s transfer committee has eased, understandably so, yet Southampton fans would still be forgiven for indulging in a sense of schadenfreude when the two sides meet. No club capitalised on last summer\u2019s exodus from Southampton more than Liverpool. \u00a350m of Anfield\u2019s \u00a3117m spending spree went on three influential parts of Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team \u2013 the club captain Adam Lallana, plus Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert \u2013 but credit for Liverpool\u2019s recovery belongs elsewhere. It says everything about the trio\u2019s fortunes that not one is guaranteed to face their former club. \u201cThey were brought in for the longer term so it was always going to take a bit of time,\u201d Rodgers said this week. \u201cThey were brought in for different roles but they are all contributing, some more than others, but I am sure that over time they will show the worth of why we brought them in. It is a game they will look forward to.\u201d There is more riding on Liverpool\u2019s investment than the returns on three individual players, however. Koeman has turned Southampton into Champions League qualification contenders having spent \u00a358m last summer and his club would hit Liverpool for another \u00a350m should they continue to defy expectations and claim a top-four finish at the Anfield club\u2019s expense. Adam Lallana, \u00a325m Rodgers\u2019 admission that \u201csome more than others\u201d are contributing to Liverpool\u2019s campaign can apply only to Lallana, the most expensive recruit from Southampton who this week spoke of his regret at how the transfer played out. The 26-year-old scored his fifth goal of the season to secure an FA Cup quarter-final place at Crystal Palace\u2019s expense last weekend and an understanding with Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho is clearly developing. Yet even the most prominent of the Southampton intake has endured a frustrating campaign so far. Lallana started 37 Premier League games for Pochettino\u2019s team last season but injuries and greater competition at Anfield have so far limited his Liverpool tally to 14. It was mid-December before the attacking midfielder embarked on a run of more than two consecutive starts for Rodgers\u2019 side and that sequence was halted at six, when his influence was growing by the game, by a thigh injury suffered against Leicester City on New Year\u2019s Day. Speaking at a Seeing is Believing event, a global initiative run by Liverpool\u2019s sponsors Standard Chartered to combat avoidable blindness, Lallana admitted: \u201cIt is difficult coming into a club like this and being yourself from the word go. You\u2019re coming into a different environment, a different home and it takes time to settle in. And that\u2019s coming from someone who knew some of the lads from playing for England. You get asked about people not settling in, you give those reasons and people say it\u2019s just an excuse. But until you are in that position or coming from another country to a big club like this, you just won\u2019t understand. I have felt more settled in the role I\u2019ve been playing since I came back into the team. That\u2019s where I have played a lot of my football, especially last season.\u201d Should Liverpool fall short in their pursuit of a top-four finish, Lallana hopes his former club take the ticket instead. \u201cDeep down I am delighted to see them doing so well,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are a lot of good people at that football club and I am thrilled to see them doing so well.\u201d Rickie Lambert, \u00a34.5m Southampton did not begrudge Lambert the chance to rejoin the club that shattered his boyhood dreams by releasing him at 15. The story-book return to Liverpool has not unfolded well, however, and the striker would have been sold to Aston Villa on deadline day in January had he agreed to the move. \u201cIt was very close, we agreed everything,\u201d Lambert admitted this week. \u201cBut it was too short notice. It was too big a decision to make in the short amount of time I had. It\u2019s hard sometimes when you aren\u2019t playing but I\u2019m at the club I love. I\u2019m not willing to give that up easily.\u201d The England international was always going to have to adjust to a reduced role at Anfield but cannot have expected such a downturn. Last season he played 2,816 minutes of league football for Southampton, scoring 13 goals (the joint fourth highest total by an English player) and having 10 assists. This term it is 593 minutes, two goals and no assists. Lambert was the Plan B who became Plan C when Rodgers took his calculated risk on Mario Balotelli and, at 33, a bit-part role does not help with match sharpness. Dejan Lovren, \u00a320m Lovren, in the context of his importance to Liverpool\u2019s summer rebuilding plans, plus his mantle as the most expensive defender in the club\u2019s history, has been a spectacular disappointment. Rodgers\u2019 assertion that the Croatia international represented the authoritative centre-back Liverpool had lacked since Jamie Carragher retired was given credence on his Anfield debut against Borussia Dortmund. But that pre-season friendly has so far marked the high point. Lovren\u2019s confidence and form deteriorated during Liverpool\u2019s troubled start to the campaign and the 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace in November was not only a watershed in terms of Rodgers\u2019 approach. The 25-year-old lost his place to Kolo Tour\u00e9 and has been unable to regain it from the in-form Mamadou Sakho. The Liverpool manager\u2019s assessment of his main defensive signing was not exactly glowing this week. \u201cDejan\u2019s professionalism has been great,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cThe team has been winning and playing well and I don\u2019t think any of the players can look at that and complain. Everyone has had ample opportunity from the start of the season right the way through the autumn. They have certainly had the opportunities to play and demonstrate they should be regulars. But when he has been asked to come in and do a job, Dejan has done it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
