There was also room for bizarre political satire as the viral anti-Brexit artists Cold War Steve and Led By Donkeys had collaborated on a billboard overlooking the entire festival site above the Park stage. A Boris Johnson tweet from July 2017, reading \u201cThere\u2019s no plan for no deal, because we\u2019re going to get a great deal\u201d, was placed next to Cold War Steve\u2019s surreal photoshopped images of politicians, pop-culture figures and the EastEnders actor Steve McFadden. Pockets of mud were the only remnants of a few miserable weeks of June weather, with temperatures reaching 20C on Wednesday and highs of 30C and above expected over the weekend. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of mud, a lack of personal hygiene and bad toilets,\u201d said Ilona, who had travelled from the Dutch city of Dordrecht with her children, Lucy and Charlie. She said coming to the festival was on her bucket list and she was glad the forecast meant mud was highly unlikely. \u201cWe were a bit worried about the weather,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hot in Holland now and it\u2019s a lot better here.\u201d \u201cWe were hoping it wouldn\u2019t be that hot. It\u2019s perfect really,\u201d said Ilona. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not going to rain and the famous mud stays away we\u2019ll be happy.\u201d JR, a rapper from Wapping, east London, who was attending Glastonbury for the first time, was shocked at the size of the site. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI got here on Monday and I\u2019ve seen it all slowly coming to life. I met some people on the gate who were here in 1981 and said back then it was \u00a312 to get in and there would be two hippies on the gate with a bit of rope that they\u2019d lift up to let you in. The scale of it now is incredible.\u201d When tickets went on sale this year, 200,000 were bought in 36 minutes. The event wasn\u2019t held in 2018 to allow the Worthy farm site to recover and two million people pre-registered to have the chance of buying a ticket at a cost of \u00a3248 for a standard package. This year Glastonbury is pioneering a plastic-free system, which means no single-use plastic can be bought on site. The aim isto save on clean-up costs, with the removal of rubbish from the siteestimated at costing \u00a3785,000 and lasting six weeks. The last time the festival was held in 2017, visitors used 1.3m plastic bottles. \u201cA vast amount of plastic bottles were gotten through and when you see images of the arena completely covered in old plastic bottles it\u2019s quite haunting,\u201d said Emily Eavis, the festival\u2019s co-organiser. \u201cWe are tackling drinking bottles at the moment, water bottles \u2026 and we are encouraging people to bring their own reusable bottle but there will also be reusable bottles available on site.\u201d The festival has already banned food traders from using plastic cutlery and plates, insisting instead on compostable alternatives. Only paper straws are available on site, festival wristbands are made of cloth, and single-use plastic cups are not used in the bars. Imi,17, an A-level student from Bridport in Dorset, who has been coming to the festival with her parents since she was six-years-old, was less optimistic about the forecast. \u201cBring wellies or boots, always,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever the weather looks like, this is Glastonbury.\u201d After a dreary early British summer there were concerns prior to the festival that the weather could dampen spirits. But the forecast is for sun, a few showers and balmy heat \u2013 with potential highs of 31C on Friday. Craig Snell, a Met Office forecaster, said that the festival is likely to be 90% rain free with some showers predicted by Sunday. \u201cYou might still need your wellies because of the rain that\u2019s fallen earlier in the week but mostly it\u2019s looking dry and sunny \u2013 especially on Friday,\u201d he said. Jonny Edmonton, a local from Glastonbury who has been to the festival 12 times, said he was expecting a wet edition. \u201cI work locally and last week it didn\u2019t stop raining. I feared the worst when I checked the forecast but it\u2019s lovely now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very mundane here for the rest of the year, this is what I\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
