The much-maligned Brazilian knows his opportunity to change preconceptions has arrived, two years after his \u00a36m transfer from Gr\u00eamio. The 22-year-old has been thrust into the argument over Xabi Alonso's sale to Real Madrid due to the fact that, in the absence of the injured Alberto Aquilani, he is Ben\u00edtez's choice to plug the gap in the Liverpool midfield. His response against Stoke City, and even in defeat at Tottenham Hotspur, has been impressive. Ben\u00edtez identified Lucas as Liverpool's best player in pre-season and one of only three \u2013 along with Jos\u00e9 Reina and Glen Johnson \u2013 to meet the standard required at White Hart Lane. Hence the Spaniard's anger at the pundits who pinpointed the departure of Alonso and the promotion of Lucas as the reasons for that defeat. Lucas will never be a like-for-like replacemement for Alonso, but until Aquilani is available it is up to the Brazil international to postpone the inquest into the merits of that transfer deal, arguably another reason why Ben\u00edtez is so protective of his signing. \"It is a chance for me now, but we hope Alberto will be back soon,\" Lucas said. \"We have a lot of games this season and we need all of the squad fit and ready to play. I'm playing well and training well, doing things in the right way, so now I just have to keep going. Every time I speak to someone they always ask how I am playing, but when the team play well it helps everyone and I'm the same. I'm just trying to do my best for the team. I want to do well for myself, but the first thing is to help the team win games.\" Lucas admits, however, that he has had to improve mentally this season following a fraught start to his Anfield career. The midfielder said: \"Back in Brazil everything seemed to progress perfectly for me. I played well, scored goals and won titles. Since I moved to Liverpool I've had some difficult moments, but I think those experiences can help me. They have made me mentally stronger. Also, I've done plenty of work in pre-season, I'm better able to cope with the physical side of the game here. I think I'll be able to get forward more and believe I can have a good year and help us challenge for the title again.\" The Brazilian was instructed to play a more advanced role against Stoke on Wednesday as Ben\u00edtez sought a solution to the seven home draws that cost Liverpool badly last season. Lucas also identified the impact of Johnson, who has given Liverpool the width and creativity that contributed to the convincing 4-0 win. \"I think Glen is settled here now and we are happy to see him playing like that,\" said Lucas. \"He and Dirk [Kuyt] can switch positions, with Dirk going inside and Glen overlapping, which will help get more players forward and create chances for us.\" Liverpool, meanwhile, are close to completing the \u00a31.5m signing of the AEK Athens defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos, subject to the 30-year-old passing a medical."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
