After about 20 minutes of questions he looked down at it and said: \"Strange that no one's actually naming the Latvian team we're playing. Can anyone pronounce it?\" No one seemed too sure but Roeder trusts that he will know an awful lot about FK Ventspils - the name written on that bit of paper - by the time his Newcastle side travel to the Baltic port town in the north of the country for the first leg of their Uefa Cup second qualifying round tie on August 10. Roeder is a good friend of Gary Johnson, the former Latvia national coach, now at Bristol City. Indeed the pair spent a week together in June when they were billeted at Warwick University on the Uefa Pro licence course. \"Gary's dad was a physiotherapist at QPR when I played there, so I know him very well,\" said Roeder. \"We obviously need to do our homework and find out about this team as quickly as we can.\" He confirmed that his chief scout David Mills will watch Ventspils, who currently lead the Latvian premier league, in league action on Tuesday. \"I'll be on the phone to Gary but it's ironic that we actually spoke about football in Latvia when were on the Pro licence together. \"The problem he found there was that every team played in old-fashioned Russian style with two man-markers and a deep sweeper. It took Gary a lot of hard work to convince the league teams to play with flat back fours which is what the national side needed. In the end he called all the managers to a meeting and convinced them to switch to flat back fours. \"I don't know if they've since gone back to the old Russian style but I'll have a chat with Gary about the team we're playing. I'll get a good insight into their players, the town and the ground. I've not been to Latvia before and I'm looking forward to it.\" Newcastle, at home to PSV Eindhoven in a friendly today, are continuing to pursue new, primarily attacking, signings. \"We're in the process of maybe talking to one at the moment with the other club's permission,\" said Roeder. \"And there are one or two others where you don't need a club's permission for talks.\" Newcastle were close to allowing Monaco to take Jean-Alain Boumsong on a year-long loan but the deal foundered when the French club demanded that the Tyneside club continued to pay 50% of the central defender's salary.
