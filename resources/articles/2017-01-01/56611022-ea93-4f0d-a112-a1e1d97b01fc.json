It was an extraordinary show of support for a leader whose apparently lukewarm opposition to Brexit, and call to invoke article 50 immediately on the morning of 24 June, had alienated almost all of his shadow cabinet and 172 of his MPs. Four months on from his second landslide victory, Corbyn\u2019s stance on Brexit has once again thrown Labour into very public disarray. A new crop of frontbenchers, unwilling to invoke article 50, is in open revolt against the leadership\u2019s imposition of a three-line whip on the government\u2019s EU withdrawal bill. The Labour grassroots in areas that voted decisively for Remain, such as Liverpool (where 58% backed EU membership), are divided over the party\u2019s direction on Europe \u2013 and unlike in previous policy debates, such as airstrikes in Syria, the party has not launched one of the online consultations Corbyn promised would revolutionise its internal democracy. It remains to be seen whether members will turn out in their thousands again to give their unconditional backing to Corbyn: even The Canary, the leftwing news website frequently parodied for its unflinching support for the Corbyn project, had turned against the Labour leader by Friday. \u201cCorbyn has chosen to back the government without guaranteeing that the most vulnerable people, and the most valued principles of our participation in the EU project, will be protected post-Brexit,\u201d read its editorial. \u201cIt is a decision that could sink his leadership of the party, and kill off any chance of a bona fide leftwing alternative among the national Westminster parties. This is a colossal mistake.\u201d On Merseyside, among those unimpressed with Labour\u2019s mixed messages on Brexit is Cieran Simpson, a third-year journalism undergraduate at Liverpool John Moores University, who paid \u00a325 to vote for Corbyn as a registered supporter last summer and shares his socialist politics. But, convinced leaving the single market is a bad idea, he believes they need to provide much stronger opposition to a hard Brexit driven by the Tory right and Ukip. \u201cCorbyn did a lot in the run-up to the referendum, but he wasn\u2019t gung-ho about Remain and he\u2019s still coming across that way \u2013 and that\u2019s causing uncertainty among the electorate. That\u2019s what a lot of people are annoyed with,\u201d he said at Lime Street station on Friday evening. \u201cIf we want to convince people over Brexit, we have to be clear, and we have to get a firm, concise message out there in the press and on social media, like Theresa May has with \u2018Brexit means Brexit\u2019. People can latch on to that in a way that they haven\u2019t been able to with our messaging.\u201d In private, growing numbers of Labour MPs have criticised the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Kier Starmer, as overly lawyerly, and are pressing ahead with their own policy initiatives. Simpson is from Seascale, the village in the West Cumbrian constituency of Copeland, home to the Sellafield nuclear decommissioning plant. He is largely sympathetic to Corbyn\u2019s predicament, but he says the electorate\u2019s uncertainty on where he stands, both on Brexit (62% in Copeland voted Leave) and the nuclear industry, could be the party\u2019s undoing in next month\u2019s crunch byelection, where the Tories are odds-on favourites to take the seat for the first time since 1935. Elsewhere in its provincial heartlands, Labour faces the ignominious prospect of losing Stoke-on-Trent Central, which it has held since 1950, to Ukip\u2019s leader Paul Nuttall \u2014 for whom clarity on Brexit, and contentious issues such as free movement of EU migrants, is not an issue. But as this week\u2019s Commons vote approaches, dozens of pro-Remain Labour MPs are preparing to ignore their leader and vote against triggering article 50. Liverpool Riverside\u2019s Louise Ellman is among them. \u201cI\u2019m very clear. I\u2019m not going to vote to trigger article 50, three-line whip or not. I\u2019m elected to take my own decisions, and I\u2019m very conscious that 73% of my constituents voted to remain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe main reason for Liverpool\u2019s transformation has been support from the EU, and I see absolutely nothing in the government\u2019s plans that\u2019s going to retain that support for Liverpool. The party as a whole has got a number of issues to consider. There were areas that were very supportive of leaving, though the people who voted for it weren\u2019t always aware of the real implications of that. So I\u2019m voting the way I am, I\u2019m very firm about that. I\u2019m not going to change.\u201d The sheer complexity and overwhelming scope of the debate means members of Ellman\u2019s constituency party are far from united behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s a really complicated issue \u2014 it can\u2019t just be summed up in a quote on an opposition candidate\u2019s leaflet. We need to have a serious discussion about what politics means in 2017,\u201d says city councillor Rachael O\u2019Byrne, a Corbyn supporter who voted Remain and believes Labour\u2019s ongoing internal debates, both locally and nationally, are a necessary evil. \u201cConstituency MPs, and the leadership, are in a really difficult position. There\u2019s a diverse range of opinion within the party and we need to discuss this collectively.\u201d Other MPs in England\u2019s major cities and university towns, frontbenchers among them, will vote in line with their constituencies and rebel on the article 50 bill. By Friday, shadow Wales secretary Jo Stevens and shadow early years minister Tulip Siddiq had already resigned, citing Remain majorities in their Cardiff and north London constituencies. Clive Lewis, the leftwing shadow business secretary tipped by bookmakers as a future leader, has pledged to vote against the third reading of the bill should Labour\u2019s amendments fail to pass. Another 19 Labour backbenchers, including Siddiq, have put forward a Commons motion to throw out the government\u2019s bill to trigger article 50, arguing they cannot support Theresa May\u2019s plan to take Britain out of the EU\u2019s single market. Labour\u2019s divisions on Europe are the inevitable consequence of electoral arithmetic. While 65% of Labour voters backed Remain, 161 (roughly two-thirds) of its constituencies voted Leave. Any course of action the leadership takes is bound to alienate a chunk of the party\u2019s base, but according to David Lammy, the Tottenham MP, its attempt to whip MPs into backing article 50 could have disastrous consequences. \u201cIt is shockingly bad politics,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone understands Labour voters are split down the middle over Brexit, north and south, middle class and working class, young and old, but so too are the Tories. By taking a side and not allowing MPs to vote with their conscience, Labour\u2019s leadership is forcing an exodus of Remain voters and members.\u201d Even on Merseyside, says Liverpool University\u2019s head of politics, Dr Stuart Wilks-Heeg, Brexit \u2013 and Corbyn\u2019s \u201cunbelievable\u201d lack of a definitive argument \u2013 could change a political game dominated by Labour. The Lib Dems controlled the council as recently as 2010, and a flight of pro-EU voters, increasingly willing to forgive the sins of coalition, could add urgency to their sluggish comeback (they currently hold four seats to Labour\u2019s 80, but hope to finish a strong second on a pro-EU platform in May\u2019s mayoral election). Many scousers still loyal to Corbyn are increasingly pessimistic about the Brexit debate: they feel their man simply cannot win. Science teacher and stalwart supporter Stu Burcher, from Norris Green, joined Labour to vote for Corbyn in 2015 after briefly abandoning the party under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. \u201cJeremy is in a position where he can\u2019t please everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s like a lot of the general public in that he\u2019s only about 70% for Remain \u2013 and I was very much like that \u2013 and he\u2019s doing the best he can. I don\u2019t know what he can do. He\u2019ll be criticised if he does a three-line whip, or if he allows a free vote.\u201d Labour\u2019s existential bind on Brexit means the problem as it stands is close to insoluble. Down the East Lancs Road in Leigh, Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham is one of a number of high-profile Remainers who have broken decisively with past Labour policy, backed the invocation of article 50 and called for the end of free movement (others include Chuka Umunna, Rachel Reeves, Pat McFadden, Stephen Kinnock and Emma Reynolds). \u201cI struggle to see how, after a clear referendum result, parliament could somehow vote to not respect that result. Labour\u2019s got to show that it understands that,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 January 2017. An earlier version said Clive Lewis was \u201cwidely tipped to harbour aspirations to replace his ally Corbyn as leader\u201d. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
