Either could have broken away on the home straight but the spirit of the event saw them share victory. Tomorrow clenched fists, rather than friendship, could be the order of the morning when the 27th staging of the world's greatest marathon reaches its climax. Unless the expected temperatures of 20C play a part, the majority of the elite men's field could still be bunched together when the runners turn into Birdcage Walk with the finish line in The Mall less than half a mile away. Such is the high-class gathering for this race that any of 10 athletes could be jostling for position. If it came to that, Felix Limo, of Kenya, the defending champion, might have too much speed for Paul Tergat, the world record holder, the Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie or the American Khalid Khannouchi. Italy's Stefano Baldini, the Olympic champion, or Kenya's 2005 London champion Martin Lel, can also not be ruled out. And when an athlete of the stature of Gebrselassie says victory in London in a world-record time would match winning Olympic gold, there is no greater endorsement of an event which began with little more than 7,000 runners and tomorrow is expected to have 35,400 finishers. Do not expect to see a Briton chasing glory. Jon Brown, the country's No1, who was fourth at the last two Olympic Games, yesterday refused to speculate on why it is now 14 years since a British man, Eamonn Martin, won in London. \"You know the reasons\" was his answer. David Bedford, the London Marathon's race director, has questioned the work ethic of some of the British men. Brown has a best of 2:09:31 - Tergat's world record is 2:04:55 - while Dan Robinson, who won bronze at the Commonwealth Games last year, has a best of 2:13:53. The British record of 2:07:13 is still held by Steve Jones from 1985 in Chicago. Many believe Mo Farah, Britain's leading young distance runner, is the best hope of the country producing another marathon champion because of the grounding he is gaining on the track and at cross-country. But there are no signs that he will even run a marathon and, if he does, it may not be before the Olympics in London in 2012. The presence of Paula Radcliffe, who broke the world record in London in 2003, has overshadowed the lack of impact by the men. But breakthroughs can be made. Twelve months ago Mara Yamauchi lifted herself to second on the rankings behind Radcliffe when she ran a best of 2:25:13, and she has now taken time out from her job as a diplomat working for the Foreign Office in Tokyo and London. Yamauchi, 33, is aiming for 2:23 tomorrow. She was sixth last year, 10th in 2005 and 17th 12 months before that. Her husband is Japanese and she now lives in Tokyo. \"People like Paula make it look very easy and then people wonder why don't we have more Paulas,\" she said. \"There is actually a lot of improvement in British marathon running among the men and women but just because it is not at the top of the world, people do not necessarily take notice. There is a great deal of depth and hopefully a few of those might make a breakthrough and we will get them at the sharp end. But you have to devote your life to being a top marathon runner. \"I am on unpaid leave and my husband has just left his job so he can help me. If you are committed to a job and have a family, you cannot just go off to altitude for six weeks. It is a 24/7 existence, you have to eat the right things, you have to have a lot of medical and physio back-up and mentally it is very tough.\" Sixteen months before the Beijing Olympics, China's Zhou Chunxiu could set the standard. She is the only competitor to have gone under 2:20 - she ran 2:19:51 last year - having made history 12 months earlier by becoming the first woman to run four sub-2:30 marathons in a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
