Meanwhile Elise Mertens, whom Osaka beat 6-2, 7-6 (5) in the other semi-final, was glad to praise Osaka, who also received a messages of support from the Williams sisters and Billie Jean King. Konta surprised those who know her by claiming to be altogether unaware of the issue, even though it was front-page news across the US that Osaka had declined to play on Thursday, after which the organisers suspended the tournament for a day, in keeping with sporting boycotts across the nation. \u201cI am not really up-to-date on current affairs,\u201d Konta admitted. \u201cI am very aware of the [Black Lives Matter] movement, and very aware of what has happened while I was at home. But I haven\u2019t watched the news here. I didn\u2019t see Naomi\u2019s post. I really wasn\u2019t aware of the situation in its entirety. That decision was taken out of my hands. I fully understand why the tournament and why the USTA, US Open, WTA and ATP decided the way that they did.\u201d Azaranka didn\u2019t do much better in the awareness stakes: \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t really pay attention to that,\u201d she said when asked if she thought Osaka had done well to put her cause to one side for a couple of hours. \u201cI think the most important thing is that tomorrow we\u2019re going to play a good match,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s it. Let\u2019s talk about tennis. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Mertens, who would have received a walkover into the final had Osaka not changed her mind about playing in the semi-finals, had no reservations in declaring, \u201cI\u2019m actually happy that she played because I can see where my level is at against her. Even more important is the tournament that\u2019s coming, the US Open. I totally respected her decision. I think it\u2019s great what she does, and she\u2019s a role model for tennis. So, totally accepted.\u201d Osaka was direct then coy when asked for her reaction to the comments of Konta and Azarenka. \u201cHonestly, when I posted it, I thought it would just make ground in tennis circles. I wasn\u2019t aware of the reach that it would get.\u201d But it surely reached the locker room, although Osaka was charitable enough to say, \u201cAs for other players, if I were in the position where I didn\u2019t know that much information, I wouldn\u2019t make a comment either. I know both of them as people and they\u2019re both really nice. \u201cI feel like you\u2019re trying to dig a little bit, to be honest. I would say if there was an issue, they would come to me face to face.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
