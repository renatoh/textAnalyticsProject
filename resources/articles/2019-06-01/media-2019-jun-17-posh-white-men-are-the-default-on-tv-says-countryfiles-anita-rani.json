Rani, born in Bradford to Indian parents, said the BBC would not allow her to follow up her successful BBC Two documentary about Bollywood with another about Hollywood, asking her: \u201cWhy you, Anita?\u201d She said she had to make a special case to move to Radio 5 Live from the BBC\u2019s Asian Network, telling the latter\u2019s then controller, Bob Shennan: \u201cI want to leave and if you rate me as a broadcaster I want to work on 5 Live.\u201d She said: \u201cHe did, he gave me a job on 5 Live, but I had to jump up and down to get it. To an extent we all have to speak up about what we want. But what I want isn\u2019t always what is wanted of me.\u201d Opening Channel 4\u2019s diversity festival in Bradford on Monday, Rani said: \u201cI feel I have to justify why I should present things more than anyone else because I\u2019m an Asian woman, and on top of that I\u2019m blimmin\u2019 northern. \u201cI\u2019m expected to explain why I should be presenting something much more than others. You would never think to ask the number of posh white men on TV: \u2018Why did you get to present shows about train travel in India?\u2019 or whatever it might be because, you know what, they are the default. They don\u2019t need to worry about authenticity or what space they are taking up. I do, all the time.\u201d Rani called for more diversity behind the camera, saying she was the \u201conly brown face\u201d among the whole crew making the Bollywood programme for BBC Two last year. \u201cWalking into the production office to meet the entire team, guess what, I was the only brown face in the team. \u201cI know that everyone else in that room knew fuck all about Bollywood but were employed because they are damned good at what they do \u2026 however, it was a missed opportunity to give someone an opportunity.\u201d She said she had gone to the BBC with a proposal for a sequel investigating \u201cthe obvious follow-up\u201d, Hollywood, but was turned down by executives. \u201cThe question that came back was: why you, Anita? Why you indeed?\u201d They could not see her presenting a show on that topic, she said. \u201cOf course they could understand me making a programme about Bollywood, but Hollywood? What has it got to do with you?\u201d She added: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t need a reason to present a programme about Hollywood.\u201d Rani said she had once been asked by a journalist \u201cwhy it was good for Asian Britain\u201d that she presented Countryfile. \u201cAnd I said it was more important for the rest of Britain that I was on Countryfile. I feel it is incumbent on us as an industry to diversify. We live in times when populism is on the rise, when hate crimes are on the up and a man who described women in burkas as letterboxes might be the next prime minister.\u201d Rani continued: \u201cWhile I\u2019m fiercely proud of my Indian heritage, my ethnicity doesn\u2019t always define my work choices. So when young people see me on something, whether telling their story or not, I am representing them. But the journey to be accepted by middle England on primetime TV has not been easy or straightforward.\u201d The presenter said she decided she wanted to be on TV after watching Bhaji on the Beach, written by Gurinder Chadha and Meera Syal and made by Film4 in 1994. \u201cI saw it and thought: holy shit, I could do that. I could tell stories that reflect who I am.\u201d A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud that Anita presents some of our most popular programmes including BBC One\u2019s War on Plastic with Hugh and Anita, Countryfile and The Victorian House of Arts and Crafts on BBC Two as well as the BBC\u2019s recent coverage of the Royal Wedding. We have a wider variety of presenters and programmes than any other broadcaster, and a range of initiatives to increase diversity on and off air.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
