Running-out-on-the-pitch music? The entry music? The fanfare? I ask, because I have been commissioned to compose such a piece of music for Queens Park Rangers, the team I have supported for 33 years, man and boy. Or man and man, strictly. As a composer, I'm obviously delighted that I will be able to make my personal contribution to upgrading the quality of the football - or maybe just the quality of the music the stadium announcer plays. It will be music of a type that 99% of the fans at Loftus Road will not be familiar with. As with Final Score - a previous musical love letter to QPR and its great mid-70s hero, Stan Bowles - the task is to combine something Nymanesque without sacrificing wide appeal. But it can be done. This composition fits into a grand tradition of contemporary music at Loftus Road. When I started watching the Rs, I went with a group that included musicians, writers and composers such as John Tilbury, Tom Phillips and Gavin Bryars. I maintain that the best writing about QPR - and possibly about football - was a piece I commissioned from Tilbury for Vogue. It was a musicological analysis of the descending minor third in the \"Rodney!' chant that QPR fans of the early 70s sang for Rodney Marsh, based on the differences in the chant when QPR winning and when they were losing. As for this commission, I shall not be making references to Tina Turner's The Best, long the choice to accompany the teams at grounds across the country. I'm a very self-conscious, postmodern composer, so I know what I'm referring to when I make musical references. But sometimes, when I'm in a sort of abstract process and working on a chord progression and on top of that writing a melody, then it might be pointed out to me that I have written something that sounds like We Are the Champions. This will be a piece of very, very functional music. It will be a conscious manipulation of sound. But really it will be a big tune with a hooky riff, as memorable and as exaggerated as possible. It will be glorifying QPR, and while we can't be sure what politicians mean when they accuse people of \"glorifying terror\", it's easy to understand what glorifying QPR means. \u00b7 Michael Nyman performs pieces from his latest CD, The Piano Sings, at the Barbican, London, tonight. \u00b7 Interview by Michael Hann"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
