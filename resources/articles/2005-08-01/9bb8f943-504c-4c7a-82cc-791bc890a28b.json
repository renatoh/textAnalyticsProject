France's world championship heptathlon contender Eunice Barber arrived in Helsinki still seething over Paris's 2012 Olympic bid defeat. She had no doubt who is to blame for London's come-from-behind victory. \"The athletes believe that too many politicians were involved [in the Paris bid], and not enough athletes,\" Barber said. \"I think in France in general, sport is becoming too political and that is very, very bad. It was a big shock . . . I think most of the French thought they had already won it.\" Barber's view is far from unique among the French team. \"It's really disappointing,\" said Christine Arron, one of the favourites for the 100m. \"The bid could have been run better.\" Meanwhile Barber's toughest heptathlon rival, Swedish superhero Carolina Kluft, may suffer a rare dent in her popularity at home after Sweden's biggest- selling tabloid, Expressen, yesterday ended a sponsorship deal with the country's athletics federation because of her behaviour. The row flared after Expressen published an article by the columnist Mats Olsson in which he wrote that Kluft's \"greatest injury is called Patrik Kristiansson\". This led to her boyfriend Kristiansson, Olympic and world champion pole-vaulter, saying they would not wear Ex pressen's logo at the world championships - backed by their trainers Agne Bergvall and Miro Zalar. Expressen's marketing director, Mats Lothen, claims this support means the Swedish federation is guilty of breach of contract. \"They obviously can't tell the difference between journalism and marketing,\" Lothen said. \"Our sponsorship should not mean we allow its stars to direct our editorial.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
