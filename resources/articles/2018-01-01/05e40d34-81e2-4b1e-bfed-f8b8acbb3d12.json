Last year bonus points were adopted on a trial basis for the first time in the competition\u2019s 125-year history. During last year\u2019s tournament 11 bonus points were awarded but they did not have a direct impact on the final standings with England having already sealed the successful defence of their title before a final weekend defeat by Ireland. \u201cOverall we\u2019re very happy with bonus points,\u201d said Feehan, \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to give you empirical evidence that it\u2019s better. But we believe overall, on balance, that it was a good decision and we\u2019re going to keep it. It certainly didn\u2019t take away from anything. It\u2019s a very evenly matched tournament this year and we think the bonus points may have more of an impact this time.\u201d Feehan also confirmed the tournament will remain the same length with two fallow weekends after England, who wanted the competition truncated, were outvoted five-one at a Six Nations board meeting in September. \u201cYou can\u2019t bring it down below seven weeks because the guys can\u2019t perform at that level five weeks on the trot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly unfair on the smaller nations \u2013 England and France might have the resources to do that but others don\u2019t. The reality is we need to keep the integrity of the tournament right and so we need to have the rest weeks to do that.\u201d Feehan said the Six Nations would be happy to move the traditional start date at the beginning of February back by two weeks as part of the new restructured global calendar, due to come in to force after the 2019 World Cup. That could mean the tournament finishing in early April and therefore cause a potential clash with the Champions Cup quarter-finals. \u201cIf the start date is pushed back to start in the middle of February, that\u2019s OK, it\u2019s no big deal there,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
