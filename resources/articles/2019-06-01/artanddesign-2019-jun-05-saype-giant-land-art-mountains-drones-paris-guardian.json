It\u2019s an odd sight in the park beneath Paris\u2019s main tourist attraction, but in the morning rush, few people pause to wonder what he is doing. They simply continue trampling over the grass, or let their dogs bound over it. \u201cI\u2019m used to all kinds of hazards to my work,\u201d shrugs the artist Saype. \u201cIf it\u2019s not the weather, it\u2019s cows walking over it, or moles popping up, and here it\u2019s dogs. I take it as a lesson in humility.\u201d Saype \u2014 real-name Guillaume Legros \u2014 is one of France\u2019s newest street art sensations, a rural graffiti artist who, instead of working in urban settings, creates his own brand of land art: massive biodegradable paintings on enormous stretches of grass on mountainsides. Where land art was traditionally about building epic works from rocks and natural materials on the ground or mowing and carving shapes into the landscape, Saype instead spray-paints ultra-realist, street-art images of local people on to the grass itself. His scale is gigantic \u2013 covering huge swathes of fields and mountains using his own recipe of homemade biodegradable paint. From a woman\u2019s face on fields in the French Alps to a giant grandad in braces on a Swiss mountainside or a child in a Russian clearing, his works are visible from the air \u2014 a new artform for the era of drones \u2014 and don\u2019t last long, soon disappearing again into the landscape. But now Saype is returning to cities, transforming parks into huge portraits visible from the sky that comment on the climate emergency or the refugee crisis. The 30-year-old is the first artist ever allowed to take over the hallowed Champs de Mars lawns under the Eiffel Tower. His vast new project, Beyond Walls, will see him spray-paint a series of interlocked hands across the lawns here this month, stretching over hundreds of square metres. They will make little sense close up on the ground, but will be visible from the top of the tower. To him, it\u2019s a \u201chuman chain\u201d and \u201ca symbol of togetherness at a time when people are more and more turning in on themselves\u201d. He will paint similar images of hands and arms clinging to each other in cities across the world over the next three years, aiming for locations from Nairobi to Belfast. For him it\u2019s about \u201cliving together\u201d, moving beyond borders and remembering history. His great-grandparents, French Resistance fighters in rural eastern France during the second world war, died after they were deported. \u201cRight now, it seems like we\u2019ve all got short memories, that we\u2019re living in a kind of negative, prewar atmosphere with economic crisis and people putting up barriers,\u201d he says. Beyond Walls is also the first time he has ever worked on a project with a newspaper. He has produced three images of interlaced hands which will be printed from this Saturday on the Guardian\u2019s new biodegradable, potato starch wraps that package the weekend print supplements. Saype sees the groundbreaking eco-friendly packaging as a way to bring his images \u201cfrom the mountainside into people\u2019s homes\u201d. If his transitory art on grass is destined ultimately to fade away, he liked the notion of making art that would be composted into oblivion in Guardian readers\u2019 bins. \u201cI love the idea that nothing is left of it,\u201d he smiles. \u201cAnd what really interests me is how people will interact with it \u2013 how will they rip open this bag? I find that act really symbolically interesting. The art will be on the compost heap, but the image will stay in the mind.\u201d The images themselves carry their own mystery. The hands gripping each other could be an act of rescue, survival or friendship. The work comes from photographs he has taken, but exactly whose hands are pictured we will never know. Saype deliberately chose not to know himself. His inspiration was the humanitarian group, SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, and their rescue work pulling people in distress from the Mediterranean, the world\u2019s most deadly migration route. Last year, in central Geneva Saype created a vast grass fresco of a girl with her hand outstretched towards a paper boat on the lake in support of their rescue work. For Beyond Walls, he set up a camera at an SOS M\u00e9diterann\u00e9e gala night and took pictures of anyone who would have their arms and hands photographed. Among them were rescue workers, sailors, refugees themselves \u2013 many who had survived the crossing from Libya \u2013 but also politicians and footballers as well as the fashion designer Agn\u00e8s B. He took around 2,000 photos \u2013 cut off at the elbow \u2013 and selected a few without knowing who they were. \u201cHands always tell a story, you have tattoos, bracelets, the hands of those who have done manual labour and those who have not,\u201d he says. \u201cEach of these hands will tell a story but we won\u2019t know where from.\u201d Many European street-artists grew up on housing estates in the hinterlands of capital cities, including Saype\u2019s heroes: the acclaimed Paris photographer JR, who pastes monumental images on building across the world and the celebrated Portuguese artist Vhils, who uses hammers and drills to carve vast faces into walls. But unlike them, Saype comes from a tiny village in eastern France and worked for years as a nurse. His spray-paint art in fields with cows deliberately conveys a rural innocence. Saype grew up in \u00c9vette-Salbert, near the Swiss border. His mother operated x-ray equipment at a hospital, his father worked in IT. \u201cI never went to a museum or a single exhibition as a child,\u201d he says. He started graffiting and spray-painting aged 13 \u201cas a kind of adrenalin kick and a way of existing in society\u201d. Countryside graffiti didn\u2019t always have obvious locations. \u201cAt the start, all there was was the wall of a tennis court or an abandoned house.\u201d Gradually he moved to graffitiing the nearest town, \u201cunder bridges or trains\u201d. At 18, he was sitting in the back of his high-school philosophy class doodling the letter-shapes he most like to graffiti. He realised those letters made the English word \u201csay\u201d and added the first two letters of \u201cpeace\u201d. That word, Saype, became his nom de guerre. Soon he progressed to ultra-realist portraits, travelling to Paris to photograph people on the M\u00e9tro and then painting them in black and white. For years he combined street art with full-time work as a nurse. He says a nurse\u2019s \u201cdaily confrontation with human suffering, ageing and illness\u201d pushed him to keep painting people. Until now, in his land art he has painted either young children or the elderly, the elderly \u201cbecause normally you don\u2019t see that in street art.\u201d He shifted gradually from urban walls to spray-painting country landscapes. \u201cI felt urban art had lost some of its meaning \u2014 there was so much visual pollution in cities that no one really saw graffiti any more,\u201d Saype says. \u201cSo I wanted to find another way to get people\u2019s attention.\u201d It was also about the climate emergency. \u201cI\u2019d read a scientific article saying that if we didn\u2019t drastically change our approach to nature before 2020 we\u2019d reach a point of no return in terms of climate, and here we are now,\u201d he adds. But it was also because drones had become available to the public, opening up view points from above. \u201cYou could have another view of the world very easily.\u201d It was crucial that his paint on grass left no negative impact. Saype spent a year experimenting in his parents\u2019 garden making biodegradable paints, first cooking up a kind of flour and water paste, which would both stick to the grass and prove briefly waterproof. Currently he uses a recipe of chalk for white, charcoal for black mixed with casein milk protein and pigments, while he searches for a totally plant-based option. His works, aided by two schoolfriends from his village, as well as SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e volunteers for the Paris project, are massive logistical operations. Designed to be seen from a distance, the work can barely be made out close-up, hence the need for wooden markers. \u201cWhen I paint, I can\u2019t see what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s very philosophical \u2013 if you\u2019re emotionally too close to something, you see nothing. It\u2019s only when you step back that reality hits you.\u201d The Paris project will take over 1,300 litres of paint, weeks of work and yet he estimates that once it is unveiled on 15 June, it will only last two days after people walk all over it. That\u2019s all part of the \u201cartistic performance\u201d as he calls it. \u201cI always set out to have an impact on people\u2019s minds and memories, without leaving much of a trace. For people to reappropriate my work by walking all over it, that\u2019s no problem to me. I paint on something impermanent, which is constantly changing,\u201d he says. \u201cI paint, I come back the next day and it\u2019s different. People say it\u2019s ephemeral, short-lived. But that\u2019s my point \u2013 isn\u2019t everything?\u201d Saype\u2019s Beyond Walls project opens at the Champs de Mars, Paris, on 15 June. His work will be printed on bags holding the Guardian on 8, 15 and 22 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
