Rangers faced expulsion from the Uefa Cup after complaining that they would not travel to Dagestan because of terrorism in the republic. They had been locked in a month-long dispute with European football's governing body, which had ordered them to go ahead with the tie on a home-and-away basis. Uefa yesterday ruled that the match would now be a one-off tie and would be played next Thursday at a neutral venue to be announced today. The governing body changed its mind after receiving reports of a worsening security situation in Chechnya, Dagestan's neighbouring state, and because Rangers would have had insurance cover for all their players withdrawn if they had travelled to the Russian federal republic. The tie had been scheduled to be played last week but Rangers were saved from automatic expulsion by the postponement of matches after the terrorist attack on America. The Rangers chairman David Murray had been critical of Uefa for insisting that they had to play in Dagestan, where several bombs have exploded since the draw for the competition was made. The Scottish giants were facing a hefty fine and a two-year ban for defying Uefa. Murray had spent the past few days locked in negotiations with the Uefa chief executive Gerhard Aigner, insisting that Rangers would not travel to Dagestan regardless of any punishment they might face. It also emerged yesterday that the Foreign Office minister Peter Hain had written to Uefa telling the organisation that it was not safe for British citizens to travel to Dagestan and that this was official Foreign Office advice issued to all British travellers. Last week Rangers took Uefa to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland in an attempt to persuade the governing body to change the venue, but lost after a judge ruled that Uefa had the right to make them play in Dagestan. Uefa insisted throughout the row that special security arrangements had been made for Rangers and that it was confident the team and officials would be safe during their stay in the republic. The Uefa spokesman Mike Lee said yesterday: \"Uefa in this situation has to take into account many different factors. We had received independent advice and also security guarantees about this game and indeed the Court of Arbitration for Sport had upheld our approach. \"However, it became clear that there was a deteriorating security situation in the area and also we were notified the insurance cover for Rangers FC had been withdrawn. We felt, therefore, a need to review the situation and decided to reschedule the match.\" Murray said: \"Rangers fully appreciate the major dilemma caused to Uefa and fully support this decision to resolve the matter in an even-handed manner. \"We would reemphasise our previous comments that, throughout this debate, Anzhi have acted entirely properly and been extremely courteous and have themselves no responsibility for the issues raised. We look forward to a sporting contest.\" The Scottish Football Association's chief executive David Taylor also welcomed Uefa's decision. He said: \"The SFA have worked hard with Rangers behind the scenes, deliberately not seeking publicity for our efforts, and we are very pleased that the object has now been achieved. \"Apart from the obvious security concerns, I made the point that requiring teams and match officials to fulfil fixtures in environments where protection can only be 'guaranteed' through the presence of armed guards cannot be good for the sport of football. \"Rangers took a brave stance, knowing that they could have faced serious consequences for failing to fulfil a Uefa Cup tie, and I am delighted that the concerted campaign by the club, the SFA, the media and the government has finally been successful.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
