The testimony by ambassador Bill Taylor, taken by Congress last month, described two state department officials as saying Trump would not \u201csign a check\u201d for almost $400m in military aid until Ukraine made good on its end of the deal. Trump wanted the Ukrainian president to \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference\u201d, Taylor said, recounting a conversation between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. Taylor\u2019s full testimony, which has been supported by nearly a dozen fellow witnesses, expanded significantly on a 15-page opening statement by Taylor that was published last month. The House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry and who released the transcript on Wednesday, announced Taylor would be the first witness he called when televised impeachment hearings begin next week. The new material adds color to a previously reported showdown at the White House between Sondland and the former national security adviser John Bolton. Bolton has been quoted as saying he thought Sondland\u2019s demand at a 10 July meeting that Ukraine announce investigations amounted to a \u201cdrug deal\u201d. \u201cWhen Ambassador Sondland raised investigations in the meeting, that triggered Ambassador Bolton\u2019s antenna, political antenna, and he said, \u2018We don\u2019t do politics here\u2019,\u201d Taylor testified, describing accounts passed on by colleagues in the meeting. \u201cAnd so he ended the meeting.\u201d Bolton has been asked to testify before Congress on Thursday, but on Wednesday afternoon it was unclear whether he would appear. Trump continued on Wednesday to deny any quid pro quo arrangement in Ukraine. But the gradual release of internally consistent witness testimony, on top of documents and statements from the White House itself, has amounted to powerful evidence that Trump is lying. Asked how he could give such a detailed account of the \u201cirregular policy channel\u201d at work in Ukraine, Taylor explained that he kept text messages \u2013 and kept notes. \u201cI\u2019ve always kept careful notes, and I keep a little notebook where I take notes on conversations, in particular when I\u2019m not in the office,\u201d Taylor said. Trump need not have been pursuing a quid pro quo in Ukraine for his alleged solicitation of foreign interference in a US election to have constituted an abuse of power, legal analysts say. But owing to the repeated denials by Trump and his defenders that any quid pro quo was afoot, the phrase has moved to the center of the impeachment debate. It came up in Taylor\u2019s testimony, when investigators pressed him on what he meant by military aid being conditioned on the \u201cinvestigation [into the Bidens\u2019 activities in Ukraine]\u201d. Taylor was asked: \u201cDid you mean that if they didn\u2019t do this, the investigations, they weren\u2019t going to get that, the meeting and the military assistance?\u201d \u201cThat was my clear understanding,\u201d Taylor replied. \u201cSecurity assistance money would not come until the president [of Ukraine] committed to pursue the investigation.\u201d \u201cSo if they don\u2019t do this, they are not going to get that was your understanding?\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d \u201cAre you aware that quid pro quo literally means this for that?\u201d \u201cI am.\u201d Other testimony by Taylor highlighted how deep the conflict was between regular US policy channels and the irregular channel, led by Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s agent. In particular, the revelation in mid-July that military aid set aside by Congress for Ukraine had been suspended without explanation was cause for consternation, Taylor said. The \u201cunanimous opinion of every level of interagency discussion,\u201d Taylor said, was that the aid should be resumed \u201cwithout delay\u201d. Taylor\u2019s testimony echoed a transcript released on Tuesday, in which Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, said no official explanation for the suspension of aid ever circulated among the diplomats who had to explain the suspension to their foreign counterparts. \u201cNobody ever gave a reason why,\u201d Volker said. \u201cThere should have been, but there wasn\u2019t.\u201d Taylor feared the irregular US policy was playing into Russian hands. \u201cThe Russians are paying attention,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe Russians are paying attention to how much support the Americans are going to provide the Ukrainians. The Russians are leaning on Ukraine \u2026 \u201cAnd they, the Russians, want to know how much support the Ukrainians are going to get in general, but also what kind of support from the Americans. So the Russians are loving, would love, the humiliation of [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy at the hand of the Americans, and would give the Russians a freer hand, and I would quit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
