Yet when Lynn Shorthouse decided to move here from Bristol, the town itself hardly registered. Instead, she was focused on a cul-de-sac of 12 new homes. \"I came here for the development, not the town,\" she says emphatically. So much for location, location, location. Shorthouse, 50, is one of the new residents of Great Bow Yard, a former wharf on the river Parrett, made up of attractive, cedar-clad apartments and family homes. The development's unique appeal, however, lies in its green credentials (see panel opposite). Not only is it a blueprint for mainstream builders, according to its developers, the Somerset Trust for Sustainable Development, but it could become a model 21st-century community. Great Bow Yard consists of two rows of housing that form an L-shape around a communal garden. Facing west are town houses and flats, with utility space on the ground floors and living areas upstairs to maximise daylight. Here, double-height ceilings create a sense of luxury - let it never be claimed, they seem to say, that green living is mean living - and the sustainable features are not immediately obvious. The south-facing terrace, on the other hand, flaunts its green credentials with solar panels and giant wooden louvres at the front. Claire Valentine, 47, lives in one of these south-facing homes with her three teenage children. \"I'm local to the area and watched it develop,\" she says. \"I hadn't planned to move, but I really wanted one of these houses. I'm no eco-warrior, but I make natural fabric clothes for a living and it's all part of the way I want to live my life.\" Since Valentine moved here in February, the heating has hardly been on. \"You feel so in touch with the elements: when it's sunny, you think, 'It's heating up the solar panels'; when it's raining, you think, 'Great - we're filling up with rainwater.'\" Neighbours include Margaret and Reg Huzzey, who moved in late last year to be nearer family. Their priority was a modern, comfortable home; the green element was a bonus. \"They're a good buy, too,\" says Margaret. \"There's talk of them being more expensive than similar houses, but looking around the area I'm not so sure.\" Four-bedroom houses sold for around \u00a3400,000. The question of value for money was crucial, says Charles Cozens, head of the trust. The idea was to lead by example and convince hard-nosed property developers - bottom-line types who don't give a fig for sustainability - that green building methods are viable and could become the norm. The project will make around 15% profit, enough for commercial builders to take an interest. Creating a model for others was one reason for building in different styles: one side is timber-framed; the other uses a technique known as thermal mass construction. And it's connected to gas mains and the sewer system: there's a pragmatism that the most resistant builder would understand. Hundreds of years ago, Great Bow Yard functioned as an important link to the outside world, bringing trade and new ideas into Langport via the river, which runs into the Bristol Channel at Bridgwater. In some ways, the town has come full circle. Nature's way: What went into Great Bow Yard \u00b7 Underfloor heating Heat rises, so this warms the living space more efficiently than wall-mounted radiators. \u00b7 Local thinking Where possible, all materials were sourced locally, to cut transport emissions. Local labour, too. \u00b7 Good wood All natural wood comes from sustainable sources. The cedar cladding needs no treatment, relying on natural oils for protection. Plywood is used instead of MDF and chipboard, because the glues are less toxic. \u00b7 Brush strokes Water-based paints and wood treatments are standard. \u00b7 Natural choices uPVC is avoided in everything from windows (wooden, double-glazed) to wiring. Sewer pipes are clay instead of plastic. \u00b7 Insulation, insulation In energy-efficient sheep's wool. \u00b7 Reclaimed materials Rubble used in the foundations; some walls are of reclaimed brick, pointed with carbon-neutral lime mortar rather than cement (cement production accounts for nearly 10% of global CO2). \u00b7 Natural heating and cooling The thermal mass construction of the south-facing wing works in conjunction with louvres to maximise warmth from the sun. The louvres are angled to let in low-lying winter sun (absorbed by the walls during the day and dissipated at night), while shading the interior in summer, when all that masonry helps keep it cool. For heating and hot water back-up, there are efficient condensing boilers using natural gas. Behind the louvres is a conservatory area that acts as a buffer zone on a cold day, a kind of airlock that insulates the main living space from outside. \u00b7 Solar panels For hot water. \u00b7 Rainwater harvesting Above the porches on the south-facing wing are rainwater collectors whose contents are used to flush the loos. \u00b7 Real-life community Mixed sizes of homes makes for a healthy, varied demographic. An old warehouse is being renovated to include studios for local businesses, so Great Bow Yard will be less housing-in-isolation, more part of the surrounding economy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
