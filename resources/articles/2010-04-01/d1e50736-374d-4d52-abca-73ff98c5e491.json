White to play. On Friday, in Sofia, Veselin Topalov will begin his challenge to Vishy Anand for the unified Fide/classical chess world championship title. The high point of Topalov's career to date was in 2005 when he won the Fide world championship tournament at San Luis ahead of Anand, Svidler, Leko and other super grandmasters. It may have been that the format suited Topalov \u2013 he has always been considered a stronger tournament than match player. The following year, at Elista, he lost his bid to unseat Anand's predecessor Vladimir Kramnik as classical chess world champion in a match marred by gamesmanship and (unproven) allegations of cheating. Topalov, now 35, will be aware that this is probably his last chance to capture the title before the pack of hungry young lions led by Magnus Carlsen see him and his generation off for good. We know very little about Topalov the man. He rarely gives interviews and, when he does so, restricts himself to chess matters. At the board, however, he is an aggressive, attacking player. He once said. \"I'm not afraid to lose. This makes the difference between me and [other players].\" His play is all about heightening the tension and upsetting the balance. The position demonstrates Topalov's characteristics: the deep opening preparation (the novelty on move 11, followed by the knight sacrifice on move 14, came after analysing \u2013 with Anand! \u2013 an earlier game against Leko), the willingness to gamble, and his liking for fiendishly complicated tactical play. Like Tal's combinations, Topalov's may not always be sound, but they are not easy to refute. In this game Anand failed to find the correct continuation and went on to lose. But even Topalov lost track of his own creation when he played 1 Rxe7+. Winning by force was 1 Re5, when 1...Bb7 (if 1...Be6 2 Nxh8+ Qxh8 3 Rxe6 Kxe6 4 Qc6+ and White scoops up practically every remaining enemy piece) 2 Qf5+ Kg8 3 Bc4 is crushing for White. chess@guardian.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
