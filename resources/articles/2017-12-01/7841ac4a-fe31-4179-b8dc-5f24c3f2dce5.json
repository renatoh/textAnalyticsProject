Allardyce has confirmed he will field a makeshift team on Thursday in order to make the Premier League trip to Liverpool the priority. Apollon and Everton, who have recorded the worst performance in the competition by an English team in history, cannot qualify from the group and the visitors are set to field several youngsters in Cyprus. It has emerged Everton may also have a below strength technical area, with Allardyce set to work with the first-team squad at the Finch Farm training ground.
