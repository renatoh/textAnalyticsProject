But given the nature of the item in question, \"a huge amount of cannabis\", it's perhaps unsurprising that the owner appears to be more than a little reticent about taking up the offer from Solihull police. \"Anyone lost a huge amount of cannabis in the Chelmsley Wood area? Don't panic, we found it. Please come to the police station to collect it.\" @SolihullPolice tweeted on December 7, sparking much mirth among Twitter users. But many will have already been familiar with the humour deployed on social media by the unit, whose tweets are a far cry from the often po-faced tone associated with the twitter feeds of many other forces across the country. The account, which has more than 11,000 followers, is among a number in line for awards in the Goldentwits, an annual scheme that aims to celebrate the most active and respected twitter users. On Monday, @SolihullPolice was helping other twitter users who had contacted it after it tweeted: \"Want any questions answered? Probably best to stick to the law, policing, public protection &amp; crime prevention but we are a public service.\" \"How many biscuits is too many biscuits? Im, er, asking for a friend... \" asked @MouldingBrain, to which the police unit replied: \"Tell your 'friend' one can never have too many biscuits.\" \"So your opinion on the fiscal policies of the EU isn't something you would wish to comment on then?\" asked another user, prompting the reply: \"One of our officers used to be a Stockbroker for a big bank so we could ask them, then again considering their track record!\" Public service tweets in the past have meanwhile included: \"Caught a shoplifter stealing from Thorntons, won't tell you where he hid the chocs - but them Soft Caramels aren't going back on the shelves.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
