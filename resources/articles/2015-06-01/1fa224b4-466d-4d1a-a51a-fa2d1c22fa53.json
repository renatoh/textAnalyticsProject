The prime minister, Tony Abbott, dismayed the wind industry on Thursday when he told Sydney radio announcer Alan Jones that he wished the government had been able to reduce the number of new windfarms more than was possible in a recent renewable energy deal with Labor, and agreed windfarms had \u201cpotential health impacts\u201d. The government had previously claimed it was demanding a reduction in the renewable energy target because the industry would be unable to meet it. West Australian Liberal backbencher Chris Back, who sits on the new senate select inquiry into windfarms, said it was looking at \u201cwhat role the federal Clean Energy Regulator [CER] should have in checking that wind farms are compliant with state laws and guidelines.\u201d Back said he believed the CER should check whether windfarms are complying with the law, and could do so without contravening the state\u2019s constitutional powers to make decisions about land use. And the major outcome he was hoping for from the committee \u2013 chaired by independent senator John Madigan and set up with Coalition support \u2013 was \u201ca recognition that there are adverse health effects on people living in the vicinity of industrial wind turbines ... that it honours the concerns and experiences of all the witness that are clearly affected.\u201d Back also said he also wanted assurances that new independent research on the health effects of windfarms \u2013 for which the Coalition promised $2.5m at the last election \u2013 will be \u201ctruly independent.\u201d In a report released in February, the National Health and Medical Research Council concluded that \u201cthere is currently no consistent evidence that windfarms cause adverse health effects in humans\u201d. The NHMRC is also responsible for implementing the Coalition\u2019s election pledge and is offering grants worth $500,000 for five years for more research on windfarms and human health. Back says he is \u201cextremely dissatisfied\u201d with the NHMRC\u2019s previous literature reviews and studies, which he believes \u201clacked balance\u201d. Queensland Liberal National Party senator Matthew Canavan agreed the CER \u201ccould be given powers to penalise windfarms if they are in breach of their approval conditions.\u201d Canavan said he thought the grants should possibly be distributed by an independent panel because \u201cpeople feel their concerns have already been dismissed by the statement the NHMRC made at the outset.\u201d A Sydney University review of 25 studies into the possible health effects of wind turbines found none had produced evidence they were detrimental to human health and in 2014 the Australian Medical Association issued a statement saying the available evidence did not support the idea that windfarm noise harmed human health. Back said that like the prime minister he would like to see fewer wind turbines and more encouragement for other kinds of renewable energy, such as large scale solar, or upgrades for existing hydro projects. Speaking on Thursday to the Sydney radio host Alan Jones \u2013 a long-term windfarm critic \u2013 the prime minister said: \u201cI do take your point about the potential health impact of these things \u2026 when I\u2019ve been up close to these windfarms not only are they visually awful but they make a lot of noise. \u201cWhat we did recently in the Senate was to reduce, Alan, capital R-E-D-U-C-E, the number of these things that we are going to get in the future \u2026 I frankly would have likely to have reduced the number a lot more but we got the best deal we could out of the Senate and if we hadn\u2019t had a deal, Alan, we would have been stuck with even more of these things \u2026 \u201cWhat we are managing to do through this admittedly imperfect deal with the Senate is to reduce the growth rate of this particular sector as much as the current Senate would allow us to do.\u201d He said the RET had been \u201cput in place in the late days of the Howard government\u201d and \u201cknowing what we know now I don\u2019t think we would have done things this way, but at the time we thought it was the right way forward\u201d. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the comments would create investor uncertainty. \u201cThere\u2019s Tony Abbott at it again,\u201d he said. \u201cNow he\u2019s anti-windmills. \u201cRenewable energy is part of Australia\u2019s current energy mix \u2026 When you\u2019re the leader of Australia you don\u2019t always have the chance to, I think, just have thought bubbles. You\u2019ve got to create investment certainty. What will the renewable energy investors in wind power now think, knowing Australia is run by a bloke who says he doesn\u2019t like windmills?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
