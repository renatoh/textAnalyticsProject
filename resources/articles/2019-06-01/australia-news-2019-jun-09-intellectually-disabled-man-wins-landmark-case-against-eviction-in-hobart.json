To be told that he had exactly 54 days to pack his bags and leave the place he had called home for a decade? To be made homeless by the state? On a Thursday afternoon in May 2017, Gregory Parsons learned that the answer was not very much at all. Standing on the doorstep of his one-bedroom Hobart flat, he was handed an eviction notice by an official from Tasmania\u2019s housing authority. In the 10 years he\u2019d lived there, Parsons\u2019 lease had been renewed 14 times. He\u2019d never missed his rent. He asked the woman at his door why he was being evicted. No answer. He went to the office of Housing Tasmania, the state\u2019s public housing landlord. They told him he was being evicted because his \u201clease was ending\u201d. \u201cI wondered why, all of a sudden, should I go? When I haven\u2019t done anything?\u201d Parsons says now. When he refused to leave, authorities successfully sought a court order to have him removed. But this week, in what advocates called a landmark decision for the state\u2019s 7,000 public housing tenants, the full bench of the Tasmanian supreme court unanimously ruled that Parsons could stay. It backed an earlier supreme court ruling that found the order to remove him from his home was not \u201cgenuine or just\u201d. Parsons, a disability pensioner of 40 years, had taken on the Tasmanian government \u2013 and won. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to go this far when it first started,\u201d Parsons tells Guardian Australia. \u201cNow it has, and I\u2019ve come out of it as the winner.\u201d State\u2019s \u2018tactic\u2019 to avoid scrutiny The story starts with the letter he received on 4 May 2017. Even then, Hobart was edging towards what the city\u2019s News Corp tabloid, the Mercury, this week labelled a \u201chomelessness crisis\u201d. When Parsons got his eviction letter, he would later tell a court he had nowhere else to go. He gets about $400 a week from his pension, of which a quarter goes to rent. He couldn\u2019t afford Hobart\u2019s private rental market, these days described as Australia\u2019s most unaffordable. The current wait for a public housing unit is 56 weeks. \u201cI thought I was going to be homeless if I did nothing,\u201d Parsons says. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018Go and do something and hope for the best\u2019.\u201d Enter Benedict Bartl, a senior solicitor at the Tenants\u2019 Union of Tasmania and Parsons\u2019 lawyer. The case came to him through the office of the Labor MP and shadow treasurer Scott Bacon. His electorate includes the working class suburb of Glenorchy, where Parsons lives. Bartl was outraged that the government\u2019s public housing authority was arguing it \u201cshouldn\u2019t be treated any differently to a private landlord\u201d. After changes to state tenancy laws in 2013, Housing Tasmania had been increasingly placing its tenants on fixed-term contracts. When the lease was up, it could issue a notice to vacate like the one handed to Parsons. People could not challenge their eviction, because there was nothing to challenge. \u201cAll they do is attach the residential tenancy agreement to the notice to vacate and they hand it to the judge and say, \u2018his lease is ending, and here\u2019s the proof\u2019,\u201d Bartl says. According to Chris Martin, a social housing expert at UNSW, this \u201ctactic\u201d allows landlords to \u201cavoid proving the real grounds for eviction\u201d. Though the case is peculiar to Tasmania, other state authorities do employ similar methods based on their own laws. It means they can evict people efficiently without defending their case at a civil tribunal or, in Tasmania\u2019s case, the magistrate\u2019s court. \u201cThis can be significant for social housing providers because more than private landlords they are under pressure over interpersonal disputes between neighbours and use their tenancy agreements to police people,\u201d he says. The court ruling \u201cshould put an end to that particular practice\u201d, Martin says. \u2018Half packed and ready\u2019 To defend Parsons, Bartl had to know the real reason Housing Tasmania wanted him out. He filed a freedom of information request. What came back showed that in October 2013 Housing Tasmania had banned one of Parsons\u2019 friends from visiting the unit over anti-social behaviour. The notice worked and the man did not return, according to court submissions. Four years later, another other friend was staying with Parsons occasionally. \u201cI don\u2019t think Gregory was in position to say no,\u201d Bartl says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he feels confident enough.\u201d Bartl stresses that the man was not living at the property, but Housing Tasmania appeared to believe otherwise. This time, Parsons got an eviction notice. Cassy O\u2019Connor, the leader of the Tasmanian Greens, argues the case has worried many in a \u201csocially and economically disadvantaged state\u201d. \u201cPeople understand they are only a step or two from housing distress themselves,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cSo when you look at the letters pages of the paper recently, it\u2019s clear that in the community, across demographics, there is concern that Housing Tasmania would evict a man with a disability without cause.\u201d O\u2019Connor was housing minister in the Labor-Greens minority government that reformed the state\u2019s tenancy laws in 2013. Among the aims, she says, was to clear out people who were in social housing but could afford to rent privately. Instead, Housing Tasmania has been \u201cdirected to apply their lease termination powers in a way \u2026 that was never the intent of the legislation\u201d, O\u2019Connor says. In October 2017, a magistrate approved Housing Tasmania\u2019s application to have Parsons removed. Bartl had argued the eviction was not \u201cgenuine or just\u201d but the judge found he had no discretion to refuse the order. When the case got to the supreme court justice Gregory Geason, things turned around. In December last year, he struck out the magistrate\u2019s court order. Yet the Tasmanian government chose to appeal. Last week in parliament, the Tasmanian housing minister left the door open to a further high court challenge. The Liberal minister, Roger Jaensch, told parliament that evictions were \u201calways an action of last resort\u201d. Generally, evictions \u201conly occurr[ed] if a tenant seriously and repeatedly breaches their tenancy agreement\u201d, he said. Guardian Australia put a series of questions to Housing Tasmania and Jaensch. A department spokesman would only say: \u201cHousing Tasmania will take some time to consider the implications of this week\u2019s Supreme Court decision.\u201d Jaensch\u2019s spokesman declined to comment further. As the case has played out, Tasmania has been thrown deep into a homeless crisis. In Hobart, some have suggested using shipping containers to house the city\u2019s growing homeless. Perhaps unexpectedly, the Mercury this week backed a Tasmanian version of Finland\u2019s Housing First model, where the homeless are guaranteed a place to live. The longer Parsons has fought the state government, the more bleak the consequences of an eviction have become. Since 2017, the public housing waiting list has ballooned out and private rental prices have kept rising. Parsons recalls being \u201cvery nervous\u201d when the case went to the full bench. It triggered his anxiety. He\u2019d already gotten together some of his clothes as well as his pots and pans. He was \u201chalf packed and ready\u201d, just in case. \u201cI was thinking I would have to move out in a big hurry.\u201d He\u2019s been \u201cprepared for the worst\u201d but holds no ill will towards his landlord. \u201cThey\u2019re just doing their job, you can\u2019t hold grudges,\u201d he says. Bartl is not so forgiving. \u201cRather than conceding that they\u2019d got it wrong, they were fighting a case to evict a 53-year-old man into homelessness.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
