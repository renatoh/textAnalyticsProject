Fresh from announcing a new target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 \u2013 in the face of scepticism from the chancellor, Philip Hammond \u2013 May will lead a session on the climate emergency at the summit in Japan. She will promise that in future, the \u00a314bn overseas aid budget will be spent in a way that contributes to the transition to a low-carbon global economy, and will urge other countries to adopt more ambitious emissions targets. \u201cThe facts, which are clear, should guide us,\u201d she will tell her fellow world leaders, including Donald Trump, who has denied many climate science findings. \u201cWe are running out of time to act. We need a fivefold increase on existing 2030 commitments to remain below 1.5 degrees of warming. \u201cIn addition to stronger national commitments, we need determined implementation, and a change in how we invest. And we need to build resilience, both in our own societies and economies, and in the most vulnerable countries. I urge everyone here to push for ambition and consider setting their own net zero targets.\u201d En route to Osaka, May said she had been inspired to take more action to tackle the climate crisis in part by noticing the changes in the environment on her Swiss walking holidays with her husband, Philip. \u201cPhilip and I go walking, not just in Wales but also in Switzerland, and there\u2019s a particular place we go to where over the last decade you can see the glacier retreating quickly \u2013 and this has brought home to me the importance of climate change,\u201d she said. On Saturday, May will also reiterate the government\u2019s offer to host COP26, the next UN climate summit. The talks are due to be held in November 2020, but no venue has been confirmed, with the UK making a joint bid with the Italian government. The summit is expected to be attended by about 30,000 delegates, including up to 150 world leaders. Turkey is also bidding to host it. In reshaping its aid spending, Britain will be following the lead of multilateral donors in placing more emphasis on tackling the climate emergency. The World Bank recently announced it would spend $50bn (\u00a339bn) over the next five years on helping developing countries to adapt to the climate crisis. Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of the charity WaterAid, said: \u201cIt is encouraging to see the UK government recognise that all investment must be resilient against the growing number of severe droughts, flooding and storms that threaten health and livelihoods. \u201cThe poorest communities are being hit hardest by climate change and they are paying for it increasingly through negative impacts on clean and safe water supplies. These communities are the least resilient to climate events and must be prioritised. Without this, the significant development gains made over the last few decades will be rolled back, leaving hundreds of millions more people without the basic services of clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene.\u201d Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThese commitments are good in the abstract sense, but the test is always in the delivery. When talk turns to infrastructure you have to question the government further, when they start saying \u2018green this and green that\u2019 they usually mean gas. There is just no room for further fossil fuel extraction anywhere in the world in a strategy compatible with stopping climate breakdown.\u201d May\u2019s most likely successor, Boris Johnson, has previously questioned the existence of the climate crisis. As recently as 2015, he said: \u201cGlobal leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear \u2013 as far as I understand the science \u2013 is equally without foundation.\u201d In another last-minute commitment before she leaves Downing Street, after promises on mental health and housing, May will announce that the UK will allocate \u00a31.4bn of Britain\u2019s aid budget over the next three years to the Global Fund to fight HIV/Aids, TB and malaria. The Global Fund is a collaboration between governments, charities and the private sector that invests in projects in more than 100 countries. \u201cWe need urgent international action and a truly collective response if we are to tackle threats to global health security, prevent infections spreading across borders, and halt the continued spread of deadly diseases,\u201d May is expected to say. Bill Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said: \u201cInfections and deaths from diseases like Aids, tuberculosis, malaria, rotavirus and pneumonia have declined more than anyone thought possible 20 years ago. Much of this progress is owed to the funding and health products provided by organisations like the Global Fund, which the UK helped create, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. \u201cBut the job is not yet finished, and continued progress is not guaranteed. Today\u2019s commitment by the people of the UK via the Global Fund is a positive step forward in the global fight against these diseases, and will help to save millions of lives.\u201d Johnson has backed the government\u2019s commitment to spend 0.7% of national income each year on overseas aid but he has called for it to be spent in a way that helps British businesses abroad. During a Conservative party leadership hustings event in Exeter on Friday, he again backed the aid budget. \u201cI know that people say we shouldn\u2019t be spending so much on overseas aid,\u201d he said. \u201cI think some of it probably could be much, much better spent, spent delivering British commercial and political objectives, but it delivers massive results around the world, and we should be very, very proud of the good the UK does. \u201cI think it would be a very sad day if we were being seen to retreat from our global engagement. That is not what Brexit is about, is it?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
