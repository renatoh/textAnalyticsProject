The word \u201cprocess\u201d has become an almost parodic feature of her lexicon. She talks about staying in \u201cthe moment\u201d, and any attempt to pierce her carefully constructed psychological armour is met with polite deflection. But she is no robot, whatever the impression of her archer\u2011like serve and clean, well-chosen ground strokes. It becomes obvious in conversation with Konta that there is still a lot of emotion bubbling under, the jitters that her one-time Fed Cup captain Judy Murray said always sublimated her considerable potential. If those nerves did not jangle still, Konta would struggle for motivation under pressure \u2013 which will no doubt arrive at various \u201cmoments\u201d when she begins her US Open campaign on Monday against Bethanie Mattek-Sands. It is likely to be on one of the big show courts, possibly even Arthur Ashe. The pressure and the spotlight will be fierce. The American \u2013 who, with Jack Sock, beat the British No1 and Jamie Murray on her way to gold in the mixed doubles at the Rio Olympics \u2013 is Konta\u2019s polar opposite, rushing towards flamboyance and gestures, dressed confidently, it seems, in a variety of publicity-grabbing outfits. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t played each other ever and now we are playing each other twice in three weeks,\u201d Konta said with a laugh. \u201cShe is playing very well, she has an incredible amount of experience, she is coming off the back of something that is incredibly inspirational and life\u2011changing so I think it\u2019s no secret that a lot of American players play better here. I\u2019m expecting a very inspired Bethanie and I will do my best. She is a popular player and a gold medallist so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an incentive for it to be a big court. Whatever we\u2019re on, we\u2019ll make it a good one.\u201d Where Mattek-Sands has a look-at-me attitude to life and her career, Konta prefers the quieter route to prominence. \u201cI haven\u2019t really looked at myself as someone that needs to prove a point to anyone,\u201d the British player said. \u201cI look to constantly be a better version of myself every time I step out on court. That has come out with some good wins and good things on paper but if my ranking were to drop or to rise, it wouldn\u2019t affect my goals or how I want to keep improving. That\u2019s why I employ the people I employ, for me it\u2019s about working on the here and now, working on the process that matters to me but in terms of what my forehand looks like or how much or how many points I need to defend here or there, that\u2019s not my job.\u201d Did she recognise change in herself over the past year or so, rising from the outer reaches of respectability in the rankings to No14 seed here, and almost crashing the top 10 in Canada a few weeks ago? She also has the considerable financial incentive of $3.5m (\u00a32.6m) prize money to go with this title, as well as a slice of the $1m available for being near the lead of the US Open series bonus challenge. \u201cI\u2019m exactly the same person,\u201d the 25-year-old said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely older and that much wiser as well, I hope. \u201cI think I have had a lot of experiences in a short space of time at this level. There wasn\u2019t so much of a warm-up period [in her career]. It was very much just on the WTA Tour this year and that has been an incredible experience, one that I hope to continue every year for the rest of my career. Otherwise I think I\u2019m just as happy, hard-working and motivated as I was last year. \u201cI do feel that this year has gone very, very quickly, it just feels like so much has happened in such a short space of time. But I hope to be feeling the same way this time next year. \u201cThe tour keeps moving, tournaments keep coming and going, and I think the better job I do of staying present and healthy and enjoying what I\u2019m doing the more reasons I give you guys to write about me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
