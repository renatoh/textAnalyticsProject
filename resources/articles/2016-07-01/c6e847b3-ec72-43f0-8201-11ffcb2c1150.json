As a speedy type he might not have enjoyed his first attempt over a mile and a quarter if it had turned into a muddy slog against top-class rivals. Now that seems a remote contingency, he may give his trainer, Aidan O\u2019Brien, a record-equalling sixth success in the race. Few had heard of The Gurkha before mid-April, when he bolted up in a Navan maiden. Next time out he won almost as easily in the French 2,000 Guineas and spent a few days at the head of betting lists for the Derby, before O\u2019Brien made it clear that he had other bullets for that target. Instead The Gurkha went to Royal Ascot, where his backers endured the misery of seeing him finish strongly into second place after meeting trouble in running. Still, it was an impressive effort to be beaten only by a genuine Group One animal in Galileo Gold, especially as the winner had been given a better ride. This step up to 10 furlongs should help The Gurkha and it is to be hoped he does not suffer a similar tactical misfortune. While there are two pacemakers in the field of seven, that does not guarantee that the main contenders will go a strong pace. My Dream Boat or Hawkbill could be hard to catch if they get first run on the favourite. Tips for Saturday\u2019s TV races 1.45 Haydock Successful on a testing surface at Chepstow in May, Threat Assessed is improving rapidly, judging by his Sandown success last time. 2.00 Sandown At the peak of his first stint with Robert Cowell, Spirit Quartz was beaten a neck in the Nunthorpe of 2012, giving 3lb to the winner. While he endured a fruitless couple of years in France, he is a winner once more since rejoining Cowell, having won a listed contest in Ireland three weeks ago. 2.15 Haydock The mud-loving German raider Nightflower could be the answer here, from a stable that won a Group Three at this track in 2013. 2.35 Sandown A winner of three handicaps here from four visits in the past year, Chevallier looks a solid option. His yard remains in excellent form and there should be enough juice in the ground to make his finishing effort count. 2.50 Haydock In the Ascot Stakes Penglai Pavilion was too far back, given the way the race panned out, but still looks handicapped to win a good prize if things work out better. 3.10 Sandown Unlucky in running in a Group Three last year, Sharaakah showed much improved form to be second in a Royal Ascot handicap on her return to action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
