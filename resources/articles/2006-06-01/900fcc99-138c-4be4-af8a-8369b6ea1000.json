Address Stakes Hill, Bigbury, Devon. Open All week, lunch, noon-2pm, dinner, 7-9pm (last orders). Price \u00a330-40 a head with wine. Wheelchair access and disabled WC. 'Never work with children or animals\", a wise soul said, so it was tempting fate to have lunch with a six-year-old ball of testosterone, a two-year-old devil in a pink dress and an Australian. But my nearest and dearest wouldn't have forgiven me if I'd left them in the car. And anyway, who better than an Aussie to test if we Poms have finally \"got\" the relaxed seaside dining experience? The Oyster Shack, in deepest south Devon, certainly looks the part - you reach it via an idyllic tidal track - but it's not so much shack as dolled-up outbuilding bedecked with rather-too-pristine seasidey bits and bobs, but perhaps that's to appease its clientele - or \"posh wankers\", as the Australian delicately described our fellow diners. But you really shouldn't point fingers when the customers include your own miscreant offspring, who made a run for the fish tank in the centre of the dining room and proceeded to harass its occupants. Being experienced at this parenting lark, we pretended they had nothing to do with us and hid behind the menu, which makes proud claims about the sourcing of sustainable seafood, then spoils it rather by including skate on the mains. But that's as nothing when a two-year-old is testing her lung capacity, forcing a remarkably patient waitress to shout out the specials and tell us the linguine is off, presumably because they hadn't caught any. To keep the kids quiet, she recommended some \"Nibbles\" (the place has a thing about irritating names: \"Buoys\" and \"Gulls\" loos, anyone?), so we ordered olives and beer-battered prawns (both \u00a32.50), which were soon smeared over the tank as the kids continued their quest to give the fish heart attacks. There was only one thing for it - alcohol. A bottle of Sharpham Estate Dart Valley Reserve (\u00a316.99), from up the road near Totnes, was deemed \"Bloody ripper\" after the Aussie's first sip, which translates roughly as crisp with a pleasantly appley tone. It went a treat with her first course of red mullet fillet with mango and chilli salsa (\u00a35.95). The fish was \"properly undercooked, just like at home\", though the salsa didn't add much since it had been stored in the fridge, so rendering its punch weaker than an official England World Cup song. She was saved by the chilli jam that came with the kids' deep-fried calamari (\u00a35.25), which, boy brat told us as he ran past, was \"quite nice, but not as good as fish fingers\". Bratette, meanwhile, was making bolts for the door, so toddler-restraining duties meant I couldn't give my seafood pancake (\u00a35.95) proper attention, though that's no bad thing: the cheesy glop inside all but overpowered the fishy content. The glop reappeared in the Aussie's main, a 2lb lobster (\u00a332), served, as requested, half plain, half thermidor. With live lobbies around \u00a324 a kilo round these parts, that's not greedy, but to add \u00a32 for thermidor sauce smacks of a chippie that charges for a sachet of ketchup. Not that it put her off: she snaffled the lot, glop and all. My hake with Toulouse sausage and salsa verde (\u00a311.95) featured a lovely hunk of fish, a superfluous sausage and a salsa verde (literally, \"green sauce\") made with ripe tomatoes. It was more evidence of unnecessary fannying-about: where was the plain grilled, roasted or barbecued seafood? Demon girl had by now been exorcised by a waiter's gift of pencils and a colouring book, and was happily picking her nose, wiping the results on to her share of a pair of fishcakes (\u00a39.95) and tucking in - well, as long as they're eating something, you leave well alone. So her brother picked up the baton of git-dom, saying his fishcake looked like poo and bursting into tears. It was time for the harassed parents' last stand: we caved in and took them out to play in the courtyard/car park, half-hoping that a passing BMW might wing them. Another waitress emerged (they were clearly drawing straws to see who had to deal with us next) to go through the puddings, only to be rudely interrupted. \"Lemon posset!\" the Australian spluttered. \"But posset's what Americans call baby puke!\" Having put the waitress off one of Britain's great desserts for life, she then ordered it anyway. But the exemplary posset (\u00a34.50) was let down by another unnecessary flourish, a topping of extra cream. With that it was time to round up the little bleeders to partake of that other great British family tradition: hit the traffic for the long drive home. Matthew Norman is away.
