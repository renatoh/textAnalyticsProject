After a volley of lawyers' letters between the two chains, Superdrug applied to the high court for an injunction and accused Boots of \"malicious falsehood\". The legal wrangle centred on shelf-edge price tickets that Boots used to show it was cheaper than its rival on a range of products. Last month, it has emerged, Superdrug complained that some of the prices Boots was using were incorrect. A Superdrug spokeswoman said the chain was initially \"flattered\" by the price comparisons. \"They had dropped their prices to match ours,\" she said. But Superdrug then discovered some were wrong and asked Boots to make the appropriate changes. Boots, however, insists Superdrug cut its prices in response. A Boots spokesman said: \"They went to the high court to claim malicious falsehood. Unfortunately they withdrew the action before we had a chance to have our day in court.\" Superdrug says it allowed the claim to lapse when Boots agreed to make the changes requested. The whole saga, however, could soon be replayed as Boots is starting a new round of in-store price comparisons. Superdrug, however, responded yesterday with its own new price cuts - complete with claims that from next Monday its \"basket of biggest-selling lines is 15% cheaper than Boots\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
