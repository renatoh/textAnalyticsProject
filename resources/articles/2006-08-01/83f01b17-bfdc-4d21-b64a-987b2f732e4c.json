Yet there is a great deal the government can do to help them without falling foul of the familiar charge of nannying. Labelling supermarket food is a start. But most Britons have a good idea of which foods are bad for them. A better approach would be to recognise that many of us buy food when we are hungry. The journey home from work or school is fraught with unhealthy temptations: crisps from the corner shop, a fried chicken takeaway, a call to the pizza company. This is when resolve is at its weakest. It takes careful planning to ensure there are fresh fruit and vegetables at home, unprocessed food tends to be heavy, and a weekly supermarket shop is difficult to carry home without a car. Ordering food over the internet is more convenient but still beyond the scope of many. This is where local councils can help. They already consider applications for alcohol licences carefully, and will soon have greater powers to reject poorly designed planning applications. The same scrutiny should be extended to fast-food outlets and shops. When a street is already replete with a burger takeaway and two fried-chicken joints, the council ought to have the right to refuse permission for another and grant it to a shop selling fresh food. Few question a council's right to limit the number of pubs or sex shops in a particular area or its duty to provide sports facilities and open spaces. It should be similarly obliged to offer residents the opportunity to buy unprocessed food locally. Some councils have already made good progress in encouraging Britons to exercise more. The Department of Transport has given three \"sustainable transport towns\", Peterborough, Darlington and Worcester, \u00a310m to spend on promoting walking and cycling routes to school and work. But it takes an iron will to walk home and cook a fresh meal if the route is lined with chip shops and kebab vans. MPs voted for a smoking ban because the public now feels entitled to eat and drink in a smoke-free environment. The right to be able to buy healthy food locally is just as important. Given the enormous cost to the NHS of diabetes and other obesity-related diseases, Ms Hewitt could do more to help us turn away from the takeaway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
