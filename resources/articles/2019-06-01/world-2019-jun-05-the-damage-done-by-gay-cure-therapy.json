Has he no idea how dangerous and harmful his and Ann Widdecombe\u2019s views are? It is precisely because of views like theirs that the Church of England agreed to call on the UK government to ban conversion therapy after my private member\u2019s motion in July 2017. The Ozanne Foundation\u2019s 2018 survey on faith and sexuality clearly shows the strong evidence of harm that attempts to change sexual orientation are reported to inflict: 91 of the 458 respondents with experience of \u201cconversion therapy\u201d said they had attempted suicide and 193 respondents had had suicidal thoughts (\u2018Conversion therapy\u2019 leads to high levels of mental distress, 21 February). While it is indeed important that we work to protect freedom of religious conscience, this should never be \u201cat any cost\u201d. Surely the duty of any civilised society is to protect the vulnerable from harm and to protect life above all else? It is these values that are sacred \u2013 ones that care about those whose lives we impact by our words and actions. Jayne Ozanne Member of the Church of England\u2019s General Synod and director of the Ozanne Foundation \u2022 Nigel Farage\u2019s defence of Ann Widdecombe reminds me of the last line of a brilliant very short science fiction story by Arthur C Clarke, called Reunion: the last line was \u201cIf any of you are still white, we can cure you\u201d. Michael Bennett Feltham, London \u2022 Perhaps someone could remind Ann Widdecombe that the attempts of \u201cscience\u201d to \u201cswitch sexuality\u201d didn\u2019t work out too well for one of the greatest mathematicians and scientists, Alan Turing.
