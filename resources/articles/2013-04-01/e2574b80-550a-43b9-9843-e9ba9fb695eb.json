A House of Lords committee chaired by the former Tory cabinet minister Lord MacGregor, who served under Margaret Thatcher and John Major, says Cameron's government is being too complacent about the risks to its own interests if Scots vote yes to independence in the referendum on 18 September next year. In a detailed and at times highly critical report released on Wednesday, the Lords economic affairs committee made clear its irritation that the Ministry of Defence had again refused to give evidence on the strategic and financial impact of a yes vote on the Trident base near Glasgow and other military forces in Scotland. MacGregor, a former education secretary, said the future of Trident was of critical importance. Defence analysts say could it be scrapped or forced to relocate to a base in England or Wales after independence, a move which might be unaffordable. \"It's obviously an absolutely vital issue for the whole of the UK, apart from the employment implications for Scotland,\" he said. \"We hope the MoD is doing all its contingency planning, but we think it should be more open about the security questions.\" Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, has repeatedly resisted calls from MPs to discuss Trident's status; he insisted on a recent visit to Edinburgh that the UK government had no intention of losing the referendum and so was not planning for defeat. But the cross-party committee, which includes the former Tory Scottish secretary Lord Forsyth and Lord Lawson, Thatcher's former chancellor, said both governments had an obligation to voters across the UK to set out the implications of a yes vote on key areas such as the economy, Europe, its currency, defence and the fact that Scotland could inherit up to \u00a393bn in public sector debt. Voters in Scotland also had a right to know what both governments saw as \"red line\", non-negotiable positions on all these issues before the referendum, the committee said, so they could make an informed choice and debate them \"free of rancour\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
