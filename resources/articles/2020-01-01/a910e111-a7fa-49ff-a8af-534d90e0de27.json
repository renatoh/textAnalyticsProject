After Sunday\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round win over Fulham Guardiola questioned why there were not more than 39,223 at a ground that holds 55,097. This drew an unhappy response from the official supporters\u2019 club, whose secretary, Kevin Parker, said: \u201cHe\u2019s playing into the hands of the \u2018Emptyhad\u2019 critics.\u201d Tickets remain on sale for Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Manchester United, with the attendance expected by City to be around 51,000. Guardiola\u2019s team hold a 3-1 lead and the manager said: \u201cFirst of all, I understand \u2013 never was it my intention to offend them [fans]. They are part of us. Since I arrived here from day one until the last day what I want is to fight and play as good as possible [and] to see Etihad Stadium full every single game. It belongs to us to play good to seduce them to come because the only reason we do our job and I do my job is not for the titles. It\u2019s to go to the Etihad Stadium and see it absolutely full.\u201d Yet Guardiola stated he would \u201cpush\u201d for more supporters to attend. \u201cWe try to do our best to let them be proud for our team,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will try again to push them to be with us as much as possible \u2013 if it is possible, to be every single game full, full, full. \u201cI know how to appreciate [their support] because I know how many people come when we play away. We feel them, they chant, and it is so nice to have them and I know for them it\u2019s not easy. That is why I will always be grateful to the support.\u201d Clarifying his remarks from the weekend, Guardiola said: \u201cI understand it\u2019s difficult for the people to do that. It\u2019s not necessary to tell me because I was part of that when I was a little boy with Mum and Dad. Since I arrive here I learn from English football how important are the Premier League and the FA Cup \u2013 more important [at] this club than the Champions League: much more. \u201cIt was my mistake that I thought: \u2018Oh it\u2019s Sunday 1pm, today will be full\u2019 and I didn\u2019t know it was on BBC, not Sky, so they can watch it and people can decide whether to go to the stadium or not.\u201d Guardiola, who will give fitness tests to Aymeric Laporte, Riyad Mahrez and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, is conscious of the danger United possess. \u201cThey have weapons and quality there,\u201d he said. \u201cI have incredible respect for their history, for Man United as a club. They can do it [go through].\u201d City announced Fernandinho, who joined in June 2013, has signed a one-year-contract extension until the summer of 2021. \u201cThis is the best possible news,\u201d said the midfielder. \u201cI have enjoyed every second of my time at City. I never expected to build such a meaningful relationship with the club and the fans, but it has happened, and I am grateful every single day.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
