Civil servants unintentionally circulated an electronic copy to interested bodies which can be opened to reveal which passages have been removed or added during drafting. Among plans which were pulled - to be kept under wraps until a later date - were council tax reforms, a clear commitment not to cap local authority spending and new rules on charges for second homes. The council tax reform is worth an extra \u00a383m a year in England to mainly poorer councils and was withdrawn at the last minute when an adviser wrote on the speech: \"Can we make more of this?\" Out went an admission by Mr Byers, secretary of state for the new Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, that he was an \"outsider\" at a national conference of councillors in Harrogate. In came a paean of praise to a \"purposeful, realistic and practical\" partnership between local and central government. The department realised it was unable to recall the speech after it was emailed and an official said Mr Byers's office had been \"keeping their fingers crossed\" that few people would track the alterations. \"Speeches go through a lot of drafting but they are supposed to remain private,\" said the official who expects the proposals to be formally unveiled over the next few months. Mr Byers would have received a warmer response, particularly from councillors in the Labour heartlands, if he had delivered an earlier version rather than the agreed bland address. It included a pledge to abolish what is known as \"council benefit subsidy limitation\", a ceiling on Whitehall payments to compensate authorities for those on benefit when council tax bills rise, which he would have acknowledged \"will be very welcome to many colleagues in local government\". Also missing in the speech was \"ruling out capping in the current year\" to curb high-spending local authorities. A promise to \"give authorities discretion on council tax discounts for empty properties and second homes\" was replaced by \"forthcoming consultation\". Mike Heiser, finance policy officer at the Local Government Association, said: \"We have been pressing the government to abolish the council tax subsidy limitation and would welcome the clear commitment. The system penalises councils in poorer areas and therefore any reform would be greeted warmly.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
