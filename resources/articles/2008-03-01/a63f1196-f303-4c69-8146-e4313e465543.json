The timing is fortuitous in terms of garnering popular interest in the vote; a year ago, the opposition MDC had been politically outmanoeuvred and literally battered into submission by Zanu-PF. Riven by internal feuds, marginalised by the SADC's recognition of Robert Mugabe's legitimacy, and frustrated by the slow pace of the Thabo Mbeki mediated settlement talks, the MDC seemed to be dying a slow, painful death. If the election had occurred six months ago, it would have been marred less by electoral fraud, than by electoral apathy. In March 2008, a burgeoning MDC renaissance,and the emergence of Simba Makoni as a Presidential candidate, means there is a very real sense of excitement and significance; these elections matter. No one is expecting a free and fair elections, but Zimbabwe has never had a truly free and fair election in its history, and this will not change in 2008. Although the level of violence in the runup to the elections has been much lower this time around, there is a strong likelihood that violence could ramp up in the post-electoral period. The opposition has pointed out a number of glaring inconsistencies, including \"ghost\" voters' name appearing on the voters' roll; controversies around constituency boundaries; the ballot counting process; and allowing the police into the polling stations, ostensibly to help elderly or infirm voters to cast their vote. The state in turn has accused the MDC and its \"foreign allies\"of preparing a \"Kenya\" strategy to forcibly contest the results and force a power-sharing agreement. Although Zimbabwe is not yet, a failed state, it is a failing nation. Since 1997, our country has been in the throes of a socioeconomic civil war; what we might call the fourth civil war in our nation's history. It has been more political and social than the military violence of previous conflicts, but the effects on the people have been just as devastating. Zimbabwean society is polarised along ideological, class, generational fault-lines, and each election highlights the fissures. This election, against a backdrop of economic collapse, immense suffering and political uncertainty, will highlight these fissures even more. The issues in the elections are less about human rights and democracy, than they are about economic change, and creating a road map for Zimbabwe's future. Everyone wants economic change; the divisions are over how this change is to be achieved. Zanu-PF supporters - and Mugabe still has significant support in the rural areas - insist that only Mugabe and the party can consolidate the urban and rural black empowerment programme and, if given a chance by the international community, they can reverse Zimbabwe's economic decline. They also believe that Zanu-PF is the best guarantor of a managed political transition, and will defend the nation's sovereignty against the predatory west. By contrast, both Tsvangirai and Simba Makoni insist that Mugabe is the problem, not the solution, and that he has so contaminated the Zimbabwean landscape that his exit from the scene is a pre-requisite for resolving Zimbabwe's crisis. Makoni, though, is more of a centrist than Tsvangirai - he is looking to build a broad - based coalition with disaffected Zanu-PF and MDC groups. For Mugabe and Tsvangirai in particular, this election is a must- win situation. A resounding defeat for either man will spell the beginning of the end for their political career; if Mugabe loses decisively, although he would attempt to ride out the storm by using force and bluster to remain in power, many of his closest allies would undoubtedly pressure him to stand down. If Tsvangirai suffers a major defeat, it would likely mean the end of his tenure as leader of the MDC, and could cripple his wing of the MDC. He has had nearly a decade to try and attain power; voters will not give him another decade to get his house in order and get into power. Simba Makoni will get a significant number of votes, but he will probably not win the presidency this time around. He will though be a powerbroker in the post electoral landscape. Zimbabweans, like Africans worldwide, are past-masters at hiding our true feelings - a legacy of slavery, colonialism and internal conflicts, where the wrong facial expression or answer could cost your life. Thus, even though the turnout at political rallies is high on all sides, no one can predict whom people will vote for in the polling booths. In addition, given the concerns about electoral fraud, what constitutes a \"win\"? Possible scenarios include: a comprehensive victory for Mugabe. If this were to happen, the opposition will certainly cry foul, and there might be riots in the urban areas. But he would probably be able to ride out the storm, and the emphasis would gradually shift away from politics and back to the economy. A narrow victory, leading to a second round runoff, would probably have significantly higher levels of violence as both sides use every means to win. If Tsvangirai and the MDC score a comprehensive victory, the state would not be able to claim electoral manipulation, but would Mugabe accept defeat? A narrow Tsvangirai victory, forcing a runoff with Mugabe would be bitterly disputed and have no clear winner in terms of real power. Makoni is unlikely to win a comprehensive victory , but if he were to win on points and force a runoff against Mugabe, it is likely that he would make a deal with disaffected elements within Zanu-PF, and the MDC to vote for him in an \"anyone but Mugabe\" alliance. There are a huge number of uncertainties; will those managing the elections, be allowed to deliver anything other than a victorious result for the incumbent? Would any outbreaks of violence would be a blip as the country settles back into its familiar crisis routine; or a long-running \"intifada\" which the government manages, or the trigger which ultimately results in a political transition? Only time will tell. What is certain, though is that there will be no UN, African Union or SADC force coming to the rescue. Another certainty is that the elections will not end Zimbabwe's political logjam; but they are an important first act in what will certainly be a year of decision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
