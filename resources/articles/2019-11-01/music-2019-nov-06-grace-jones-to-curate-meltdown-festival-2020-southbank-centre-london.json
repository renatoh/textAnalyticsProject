She was the first artist who made me feel that I could express myself, be whatever I wanted to be, and not be afraid of what the world might say.\u201d Jones has performed at previous editions of the festival, as part of Jarvis Cocker\u2019s 2007 lineup, and the following year with Massive Attack. Her lineup for the festival will be announced in the new year. Meltdown was founded in 1993, initially as a classical music-focused festival. It soon widened its remit, making curators of artists including Nick Cave and Scott Walker. Jones is only the sixth woman to curate the festival in its history, following Laurie Anderson, Patti Smith, Anohni, Yoko Ono and MIA. The next Meltdown will take place 12-21 June. Jones, who is 71, released her last album, Hurricane, in 2008, and published the autobiography I\u2019ll Never Write My Memoirs in 2015."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
