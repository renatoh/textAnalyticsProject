But someone telling them I told [them] something? Come on, this isn't high school. They were playing with my life.\" Montgomery was banned for two years on Tuesday after the Court of Arbitration for Sport heard evidence from a former team-mate Kelli White, the double world sprint champion already serving a two-year suspension for steroid use, and found him guilty of taking performance-enhancing drugs despite him never having tested positive. What also counted against Montgomery was his testimony to the grand jury in San Francisco investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative, founded and owned by Victor Conte, where he allegedly admitted taking banned drugs. \"I told the grand jury, they asked me, this guy said, 'Did you take a liquid substance with Victor?' I said, 'Yes',\" Montgomery said. \"He said, 'Are you telling me you were taking tetrahydrogestrinone [THG]?' I said, 'No, I don't know the name of it. It didn't have a name. All I know is I took flaxseed oil.\"' The only hopes the IAAF has of ever recovering the money they paid Montgomery, including the $250,000 (\u00a3140,000) they awarded him after he set a world record of 9.78 seconds at the 2002 grand prix final in Paris, is to sue him. Montgomery, however, said: \"I deserve every bit of it, [the money]. I deserve more than what they are asking back because of the way they went about banning me for two years.\" The IAAF are already chasing the money they awarded to Britain's Dwain Chambers, second to Montgomery in that Paris race and also subsequently banned for his involvement with Balco. \"The rules are clear,\" said Nick Davies, the IAAF spokesman. \"We will be asking for the money back.\" Montgomery, though, is refusing to back down. \"I spent six figures easy,\" he said of how much he spent trying to defend himself. \"I spent a lot of money to get two years. I'm done. I never took anything knowingly. No. You couldn't bring anybody in there but Kelli White? And this is what sealed the deal for them.\" Montgomery, however, is refusing to give evidence about Marion Jones, the triple Olympic gold medallist who is the mother of his child but from whom he has recently split. \"I got nothing on her,\" Montgomery said. \"Not everybody that's around somebody is doing what they say that person is doing.\" Paula Radcliffe, the world marathon champion, meanwhile, was last night voted the Sports Journalists' Association sportswoman of the year for the fourth time. Andrew Flintoff won the men's award. There was also a special prize for Zara Phillips for her success in winning the European Championship three-day event."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
