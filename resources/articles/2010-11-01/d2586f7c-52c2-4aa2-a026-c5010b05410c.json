I was in town to start directing a spectacularly unedifying documentary about a teenage girl who operated a pornographic webcam from her bedroom. After a 30-minute wait, a frazzled receptionist showed up. It turned out the hotel's sole guest had just hanged himself in his room. We were due to stay here for 10 days. The following morning, I received a call saying the film had been cancelled. I decided to interpret this episode as a sign that I should throw caution to the wind and finally make that little indie documentary I had promised myself. It would end up taking five years to complete and cost me more than \u00a340,000. I had read that Las Vegas was the fastest growing city in the US. Every day, more than 200 people arrived there to make a new start. I hoped that in Vegas I would find families and narratives that embraced this sense of the itinerant looking for a better life. Armed with only a vague idea, no story and no contributors, there was no way I would find funding. But I didn't know if I wanted it. Funding means you're answerable to your funders and the whole point of this film was that I would be free \u2013 free to make my own decisions and my own mistakes. I bought a camera, microphones and a ticket to Vegas. It took me three months to find a story. Just as I was losing hope, I came across Vanessa. An African American from Alaska, she had just arrived in Vegas with her husband Maurice, their five youngest kids, a dog and $290. God had told her in a dream that she and her family needed to leave Alaska and make a new life. The family had spent two years on the road travelling from state to state looking for work before settling on Las Vegas. When I first met them, they were living in their car by the airport perimeter fence. Vanessa is an extraordinary woman. Articulate, passionate and resilient, she thirsts for adventure. What's more, she was completely at ease with revealing herself to me, a complete stranger. I had no idea what would happen to them or where the film would go, but I knew that I had found an amazing family; a modern-day version of the Joads from The Grapes of Wrath. Once we started filming, I saw the jobs available to Vanessa and Maurice were often so low paid that, as Maurice said: \"When payday comes, I'll have enough for 10 hamburgers.\" One time, Vanessa managed to sneak herself and the family into a casino's private swimming pool. Later, Maurice went to a casino with their last $40 and lost half. I was astonished at how much they were able to laugh things off. Hardships which would have crushed another family only seemed to strengthen their resolve. Ten days into filming, I finally ran out of money and returned to London to work as a location director on Wife Swap. I also produced and directed a film with Louis Theroux about law and order in Lagos. I developed a pattern: earning cash through making TV shows, then flying out to Vegas. This lasted four years. I had watched the family change. Vanessa had become an ironworker and had got a job building casinos. They moved into an upscale house in a gated community, but all these material gains had not brought them happiness. Maurice had developed a drug problem. Vanessa had been unfaithful. Initially, the family had seen me as a journalist: there was a distance between us. But all this changed when Maurice, in a haze of drugs, took to living on the streets. No one could get hold of him to tell him his brother had died. So Vanessa and I parked in the drug-dealing area of downtown Vegas and waited. While I was filming outside the car, a guy lunged at me and grabbed at my camera. Vanessa shot out of the car wielding a monkey wrench and faced the guy down. A couple of hours later, we found Maurice wandering the Vegas strip. Strung out, he initially thought I was one of Vanessa's boyfriends and threatened to beat me up. These incidents left me shaken. Strangely, they had been more terrifying than any of the IEDs I had encountered in Iraq. I began to question why I was making this film: a man with choices and opportunities filming people with none, or at least very few. One thing that cheered me up was that Vanessa and Maurice always found my ethical worries ridiculous. On one occasion, I went with Maurice to film his dying brother, Lloyd, in hospital. Maurice sensed my discomfort and burst out laughing at me. He explained that both he and Lloyd wanted to be filmed as a kind of record of one of their last meetings. I sensed also that maybe my presence was a way of deferring death in some way. Nothing too bad is going to happen when there's a camera around. The moral dilemmas intensified. After three years of filming, the recession hit and Vanessa lost her house and her job. I had to film scenes of her kids going hungry, knowing that, if I just gave them 10 bucks, they could eat. Vanessa understood that I had to get the story: in effect, she gave me permission temporarily to lose my humanity. The recession finally gave me a clear sense of the story, though. My film became an account of the boom and bust years, told through the experience of one family, and all played out under the neon of Vegas, where fortunes are won and lost every night. Eventually, I found a producer and we managed to get some money from More4, which will broadcast Road to Las Vegas after its theatrical run in London. When it premiered at this year's Edinburgh film festival, I paid for Vanessa to fly over. Seeing her on the red carpet was a sight I will not forget. Despite certain scenes she finds too painful to watch, such as her daughter admonishing her infidelities, she has given the film her blessing. Maurice, on the other hand, refuses to watch it as he does not want to be reminded of his own bad behaviour. I feel it's a truthful, sympathetic portrayal \u2013 but then again, it's not me under the microscope. I hope the film captures one of the great untold stories of America. Millions of families still are going through the same thing as Vanessa and Maurice. They bought into a dream of upward mobility and were effectively cheated. Certainly, Vegas is one of the hardest hit places in the US. For the first time in 100 years, it's shedding jobs and population. Vanessa still has no job. She's staying with her son in Washington state. Last time we spoke, she mentioned moving her family to California. Road to Las Vegas is on More4 on 14 December. On 1 December, Jason Massott will present the film at the ICA, London SW1 (020-7930 3647), where it runs until 12 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
