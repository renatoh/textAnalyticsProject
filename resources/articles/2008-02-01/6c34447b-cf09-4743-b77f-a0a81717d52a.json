The latest Gallup nationwide poll put him on 39%, four points behind Clinton. She held an 11-point lead last week. But the poll does not take account of the latest developments of the fast-moving contest, including the televised debate between the two last night. The first two days of the polling took place before the exit of John Edwards on Wednesday. Clinton is spending today in the key Super Tuesday state of California and is planning to do the same tomorrow. Obama too started the day in California before heading to New Mexico. \"If she wins California by even one vote, it is over,\" said a source in the Clinton team. \"He has to win California.\" Clinton has a good network, and the support of the party establishment, in California, New York, New Jersey and the other key states, and has long held significant poll leads in those states. Obama today picked up the support of MoveOn.org, the liberal blog site that brings together many of the party's activists and is a focal point for the anti-war movement, and California's service union which has 600,000 members and which had been backing Edwards. He also picked up the support of the Los Angeles Times, the state's most influential newspaper. John McCain was its Republican choice. In the televised debate, Clinton and Obama, both conscious of the damage done to their campaigns and the Democratic party by their exchange of barbs in the previous debate more than a week ago, were polite towards one another. Both opted for safety-first, with Clinton not wanting to endanger her poll lead with a gaffe and Obama not wanting to risk the apparent momentum building behind him. Obama pointedly stressed that he had been opposed to the Iraq war from the beginning, unlike Clinton who voted for it in the Senate. She probably scored over him on domestic issues, such as health, on which she demonstrated a stronger grasp of detail. They both gave polite replies when asked about whether they would be prepared to unite to fight the November election as a team, with one as the presidential candidate and one the vice-president. \"Well, obviously there's a big difference between those two,\" Obama joked. Pressed further, he said: \"Hillary would be on anybody's shortlist.\" After the debate was over, Obama and Clinton huddled on stage, whispering to each other. But sources in both camps today suggested that there was no real prospect of what many Democrats regard as a \"dream team\" and that neither would be prepared to accept second-best. With the contest set to be decided on domestic issues rather than foreign policy or security, Obama - who raised a record $32 million in January - sent out more than two million mail-shots concentrating on his plan to introduce universal health care. In a speech in Los Angeles, he set out plans for tackling the impending recession. In the Republican race, John McCain was building momentum. He is hoping that the California governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, will help him in that state and that Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, would do the same in that city. His main rival, Mitt Romney, still smarting from what he sees as McCain's underhand tactics this week in deliberately suggesting Romney advocated withdrawal from Iraq last year, claimed McCain had used Nixon-like tactics. Romney, a multi-millionaire businessman, said he planned to try to counter McCain by spending \"a significant\" amount of his estimated $270 million (\u00a3135 million) on television ads in California and other key states. McCain, a relative moderate in Republican terms, has been taking a battering from influential radio talk shows, such as Rush Limbaugh, who has an estimated 13 millions listeners but the polls suggest this has failed to slow his momentum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
