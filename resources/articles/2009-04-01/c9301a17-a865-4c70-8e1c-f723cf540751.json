Hull does, though, have only admiration for Richard Hill, the head coach at Bristol who left his post after a home defeat by Newcastle seven weeks ago all but left the club destined for the drop. \"I've learned a lot from Richard. He's a very hard-working coach who turned a club with no proper infrastructure around.\" The coach does, however, know that he has a hard job to persuade the likes of the former England scrum-half Shaun Perry and the captain, Joe El Abd, to stay, with both set for moves to France. Emulating Leeds this season and Northampton last year by bouncing straight back to the Premiership is no certainty. While El Abd, the tough former Bath flanker, who limped off just before the break here with a pelvic injury, may have pulled on a Bristol shirt for the last time, London Irish seem convinced that Mike Catt will play on for the club. The 37-year-old Irish captain left the field with a back spasm midway through the first half but his longevity at this level is remarkable. Catt and Hull never played together for England but Catt did replace him during the win over Canada 15 years ago when Will Carling was captain and Brian Moore an irritant on the pitch instead of the television gantry. Catt's departure hardly disrupted Irish's march to five points and six tries to maintain their tilt at a top-four place. Nick Kennedy, the lock who lost his England starting place in the last two games of the Six Nations, caught the eye with two of the tries with his fellow second-rower James Hudson showing remarkable velocity alongside him. \"Our high-tempo game comes with gasket-blowing potential but we can hurt teams,\" said Toby Booth, the head coach. Booth said the captain Bob Casey should be back to lead the side along with the young prop Alex Corbisiero when Irish entertain Bourgoin in a European Challenge Cup quarter-final on Thursday.
