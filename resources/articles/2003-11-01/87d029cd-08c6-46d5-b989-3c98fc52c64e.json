They are all places to see before you die, according to this book which picks out 'must-sees' from all over the world. Researched and selected by an American writer, many of the suggestions would appear on the average American tourist's wish list: Windsor Castle, Stratford-upon-Avon and Bath are among the choices in Britain, although there are also personal favourites from the author such as The Rising Sun, a fourteenth-century Devonshire inn. Perhaps in our list-obsessed culture where everything is whittled down to 10, 20 or 100 of the best, this book will appeal, but as a travel guide it's too subjective and random. In the Seychelles, for example, Schultz highlights Desroches Island and Lodge but not the equally impressive Fregate Island and North Island. If you want to visit the Seychelles, a dedicated guide would be far more useful and if you simply want a good read, there are 1,000 other books to get through first. Time Out Paris Eating and Drinking Paris may be one of the gastronomic capitals of the world but tracking down an authentic brasserie that will not charge you over the odds for a mediocre meal can be difficult if you don't know the city. So this guide (the sixth edition) is essential for any visitor, whether you're on a culinary mission to find the finest Michelin-starred establishments or simply want to know where to find good, reasonably priced food (the Cheap Lunch Challenge has five suggestions for a \u20ac15 -about \u00a310 - lunch). Divided into French and international cuisine, there are reviews of more than 850 restaurants, bars and cafes, as well as listings of tea rooms, shops, markets and cookery courses. Some of the most high-profile openings in the past year were Alain Ducasse's Aux Lyonnais and L'Atelier of Joel Robuchon - the former offers Lyonnais classics in a classic bistro setting, the latter serves up exquisite food in minuscule portions ( la grosse crevette, a single prawn, costs \u20ac16 - \u00a311). Also new is R, with its slick black and white interior and views of the Eiffel Tower. Other notable eateries mentioned are those run by innovative young chefs, such as L'Astrance where chef Pascal Barbot developed his trademark toasted breadcrumbs and basil ice cream. Alastair Swday's Special Places to Stay: British Bed &amp; Breakfast The days of the boarding-house B&amp;Bs in seaside resorts couldn't be more in the past. Alastair Sawday publishing, known for picking out quirky, quality establishments around the country, has identified a new generation of B&amp;B owners who have given up the rat race to set up stylish, contemporary places to stay. The result, in this eighth edition of the book featuring 700 places to stay around Britain, is a clutch of impeccably run country houses that has been added for the first time. New to this edition is Blairbeich Plantation in Dunbartonshire, a fusion of Californian and Scandinavian styles by a mini-loch, with a private art gallery in the sitting room. From the mosaic showers to Grecian urns, this is a long way from the Blackpool B&amp;B and not that much more expensive - doubles cost from \u00a360 a night. Choosing a Cruise by Simon Veness The idea behind this is a good one - with 40 cruise lines boasting more than 200 vessels, how do you know which one is for you? Cruise lines are falling over themselves to show that cruising is now hip, and more Brits are taking to the seas -close to a million, compared with barely 90,000 in 1986. This book does have some useful information, including what's new in the cruise market, details of the operators and their ships and even a chart with an age profile of each cruise line's clients. But you do have to hunt for it in a boring layout which has no photographs, and includes 'tips' such as 'the casino can be a daunting place for newcomers to the world of gambling, but don't be afraid to watch'. You only start to understand why so many of the tips state the obvious - 'inside cabins provide the best value' - when you read the section detailing some of the questions cruise clients have asked: 'Why does the ship rock only when we are at sea?' and 'Will I get wet if I go snorkelling?'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
