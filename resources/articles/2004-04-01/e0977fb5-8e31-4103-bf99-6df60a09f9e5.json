The First Division club are furious that the FA are breaking with normal practice by abandoning the usual 50-50 split between the competing clubs. United are to receive 27,000 seats while Millwall will have only 21,400 in a contro versial deal that will be unveiled this week. The Millwall chairman, Theo Paphitis, fears the unequal division could give United an unfair advantage over his team, who will be making the first FA Cup final appearance in their 119-year history at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on 22 May. 'We are very disappointed that the FA have reached the decision to award Manchester United a significantly higher allocation of tickets for the FA Cup final than Millwall,' the club said last night. 'Whilst acknowledging that Manchester United are a massive club with a huge fan base, this decision undermines the very spirit of the FA Cup.' FA sources stressed that they had no choice after South Wales Police told them last week to implement 'unusual security arrangements' to ensure that hooliganism does not blight the match. Things could get worse for the Londoners. By the time the 10,000 'neutral' tickets given to the FA's myriad member clubs and counties are sold, United will have closer to 35,000 fans, some 10,000 more than Millwall's likely eventual total. In another unusual security move, anyone buying a ticket from those sources will have to declare themselves either a Millwall or United follower and sit in the clubs' respective sections of the stadium. There are precedents for an uneven distribution. In 1988 Liverpool received more tickets than Wimbledon, while United were given a larger share than Crystal Palace in 1990. But Millwall want parity. 'The oldest and most respected club competition in the world has a proud tradition in which the underdog has the opportunity to meet the big club on an equal footing,' the club added. 'Having taken 47,000 supporters to Wembley in 1999 for the Auto Windscreens Shield final, it is clear that the demand for tickets from Millwall would not be met [even if] were the distribution to be split equally.' They have asked the FA 'to reverse the decision in which fairness and the spirit of this great competition have been sacrificed'. But the FA defended their decision. 'The allocation of tickets is decided by the safety advisory group, which comprises the local police force, the local authority and the stadium authorities,' said a spokesman. 'They decided these allocations were fair in order to maintain safety and security.' The FA point to the huge disparity in the two teams' average gate - United's is 67,500 while Millwall's is around 10,000 - and the fact that Millwall sold only 21,000 of the 30,000 tickets they were allocated for their semi-final against Sunderland at Old Trafford last Sunday. However, Millwall operate a stringent membership scheme which restricts the number of people that are eligible to buy tickets to 18,000. The club refused to allow new members to join after the quarter-final victory over Tranmere and only in the last days before the semi-final were members and season-ticket holders allowed to buy extra tickets for friends. The 47,000 they took to Wembley in 1999 was before the scheme came into operation. United declined to comment. While they will get more tickets than their opponents, the split in their favour still means that only around half of Old Trafford's regulars can go, whereas Millwall's allocation will be more than twice their average home gate. The clubs are due to be informed officially of the decision when they meet FA representatives at the Millennium Stadium on Tuesday. They will be told of the police's concern that if Millwall received more tickets, many could end up with touts and be sold to United fans, making segregation difficult. The police told the FA that, unless they complied with their demands, they would insist that 5,500 seats, rather than the planned 2,500, were taken out of the Millennium Stadium's usual 72,500 capacity to segregate fans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
