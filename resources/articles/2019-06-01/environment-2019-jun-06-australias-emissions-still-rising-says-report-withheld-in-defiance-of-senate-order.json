The environment department published its emissions data for the December 2018 quarter on Thursday morning, but only after the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, first disclosed information from the report in an interview with the Australian. The data had been due to be published last Friday, under a deadline that was set by the Senate to stop delays in the publication of Australia\u2019s national carbon pollution figures. Labor and the Greens have criticised the process by which the figures were released and warned it would be pursued in parliament. \u201cAngus Taylor has shown his true colours in his first outing as minister for emissions reduction,\u201d Labor\u2019s climate and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said. The latest report shows Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are still increasing, driven by rising emissions across several sectors of the economy including transport and liquefied natural gas production. The figures show emissions rose by 3.5 m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, or 0.7%, in the year to December 2018. Emissions in the electricity and agriculture sectors were down but those falls were wiped out by increases across every other sector. Australia\u2019s emissions have been rising since the abolition of the carbon tax. The government\u2019s emissions reduction fund \u2013 rebadged before the election as the climate solutions fund \u2013 has failed to stall increases in Australia\u2019s overall emissions. The quarterly seasonally adjusted and weather-normalised figures \u2013 which is a statistical tool that takes into account that emissions go up and down due to household and commercial heating and cooling \u2013 show emissions increased from the September quarter to the December quarter, something that is typically expected on this measure. But the unadjusted data, which should normally show a reasonable drop in emissions from the September quarter to the December quarter, shows only a slight decrease. \u201cIt\u2019s barely a drop,\u201d Tim Baxter, of the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University, said. On the annual figures, which are up, Baxter said: \u201c2018 was higher than 2017. 2017 was higher than 2016. This is the wrong way. We\u2019re going in the wrong direction to meet our Paris commitments, let alone deal with climate change.\u201d Labor and the Greens said the government, which published the figures on a day still dominated by news of Wednesday\u2019s AFP raids on the ABC, was trying to avoid scrutiny of its track record. \u201cNot only did he not release the emissions data by the deadline set by the Senate last Friday, today\u2019s release shows once again why the Liberals will try every trick in the book to avoid scrutiny of their record on tackling climate change,\u201d Butler said. \u201cAs expected under the Liberals carbon emissions continue to rise, once again exposing the government\u2019s lie that Australia is \u2018on track\u2019 to meet even the Liberals\u2019 weak emission reduction targets.\u201d The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the minister had \u201ccontinued his contempt of the parliament, seemingly dropping the pollution figures to the Murdoch media before making them public\u201d. \u201cThis whole process has been outrageous and we will pursue the government and the department to get answers. There needs to be consequences for breaching the Senate\u2019s orders. \u201cThis latest report confirms that investment in wind and solar is continuing to drive down pollution in the electricity sector, but we need to be exporting renewable energy too, not fossil fuels, or pollution will keep rising.\u201d In a media release, Taylor argued that while Australia\u2019s emissions were up, exports of LNG from Australia were contributing to emissions reductions elsewhere because they \u201cwere displacing coal\u201d. \u201cAustralia\u2019s total LNG exports have the potential to lower emissions in importing countries by around 148 Mt CO2-e in 2018 by displacing coal consumption in those countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a substantial global contribution to be proud of. The Morrison government is not going to trash successful Australian export industries that are reducing global emissions, in order to reduce Australian emissions.\u201d The government has also been vocal in its support of the Adani Carmichael project, a coalmine with product intended for export overseas. Matt Drum is the managing director of Ndevr Environmental, an emissions-tracking organisation that replicates the federal government\u2019s national greenhouse gas inventory quarterly reports but releases them months ahead of the official data. The organisation forecast the latest increase months ago, correctly projecting that drops in emissions in the electricity sector would be wiped out by increases in other industries. \u201cAgain, electricity emissions have decreased. These figures demonstrate they\u2019re not the real problem with regards to absolute emissions,\u201d Drum said. He said the Coalition\u2019s policy was not enough to bring the economy-wide changes that were needed to reduce Australia\u2019s emissions and work with other countries to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis. \u201cThese results indicate the newly re-elected Coalition government is still going to have to do something different and more expansive in climate policy,\u201d Drum said. \u201cTheoretically, adding money to the emissions reduction fund will help to stimulate the carbon offset market. However, it isn\u2019t enough to reduce total emissions. \u201cSomething needs to be be done to reduce our ever-increasing emissions from transport, fugitives and every other industry that keeps increasing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
