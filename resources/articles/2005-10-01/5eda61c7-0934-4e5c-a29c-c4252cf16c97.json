Into the bellicose face of the premier, a civil servant whispers that, when the president or the general made that remark about murdering the English first-born from Sidcup to Birkenhead, he was \"speaking for domestic consumption\". Many, in the Foreign Office and outside, will prefer to see in these terms this week's remarks by the Iranian president about the desirability of Israel being \"wiped off the face of the Earth\". In this interpretation a weak politician, a puppet anyway of the clerics above him, tried to raise his standing in mosques and market squares by repeating a line which has been a catchphrase of Iranian politics since the 1979 revolution. Unfortunately, 24-hour global news means that domestic megaphones carry further than intended. But Tony Blair, in his angry prediction that people will soon be asking him \"what are you going to do about Iran?\", stands in clear opposition to this view that certain parts of a foreign leader's rhetoric should conveniently be lost in translation. In fact, both President Ahmadinejad's comments and Prime Minister Blair's response raise the same political question, which is the relationship between rhetoric and action. Do the leader's words in either case suggest a basis for foreign policy, or does the foreign policy consist of the speeches? Let's war-game the possibilities. If the Iranian president is not just bigging himself up on Tehran TV, then what threat do his comments pose? The Foreign Office's \"domestic consumption\" excuse has failed notoriously at least twice: inflammatory speeches made in Germany during the thirties and Argentina in the early eighties were, it turned out, intended to start blazes overseas. But both Hitler and Galtieri had invasion plans and the firepower to attempt them. Ahmadinejad's sick hatred of Israel, though morally indefensible, is militarily just wind. The more subtle (and, for his critics, unsettling) question is the motivation behind Blair's own oratory. Perhaps Tehran diplomats are murmuring that \"premier Blair is speaking for domestic consumption\". But that is the one way in which his comments can't be glossed. Whereas anti-Jewish sentiment unfortunately would be devoured by the Iranian population, an apparent threat from Blair to impose international discipline on another rogue state would lead to domestic vomiting rather than consumption. Blair and Bush would surely have to be mad to contemplate any kind of sustained military action or regime change in Iran. This caveat will not reassure the many opponents who believe that, in the area of foreign affairs, they are mad. But, realistically, the only armed option against Tehran would be admonitory bombing raids of the kind used in the past against Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq. The effect of these, however, would not be to bolster the state of Israel but to threaten it. Bombing military installations may theoretically weaken a hostile state, but attacks in response to anti-semitic remarks merely encourage, in the Middle East, further words and actions against Israel. So the logical conclusion is that Blair's strategy is entirely rhetorical: he felt that something had to be said. This makes sense: the memory of the Holocaust has always informed this Labour government's foreign policy. At the time of the intervention in Kosovo, the point was often made that Blair and Clinton belonged to the \"Schindler's List generation\" who had been driven by Holocaust films, such as Spielberg's, to believe that military intervention can be benevolent. Throughout his watch, Blair has seemed almost hypersensitive to the potential for another Hitler, detecting versions of him in Milosevic and then Saddam, where the historical parallel proved problematic. President Ahmadinejad is no Hitler either, but his rhetoric is specifically Hitlerian. So you can see that, for a politician whose thinking is so shaped by the failed politics of the thirties, the rant from Tehran could not be allowed to stand unchallenged. So, almost certainly, Blair was just talking. But for whose consumption? For the millions of Jewish dead, I think, but also for the state of Israel itself. It's a measure of the suspicion that Blair's Iraq war encouraged that his Thursday comments were immediately seen as Machiavellian or inflammatory. But, really, what kind of world would it be in which an international leader could fantasise about Israel's disappearance and not be seriously rebuked for it? If there was a practical calculation behind the verbal response of Blair and other EU leaders, it might be a desire not to leave Israel feeling isolated; for, while Iran is unlikely to attack Israel and the US-UK will almost certainly not target Tehran, Israel is both practically and emotionally in a position where it might lash out at the rhetorical aggressor. In which case, the opposite of the old diplomatic whisper is the case: Blair was speaking for foreign consumption only. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
