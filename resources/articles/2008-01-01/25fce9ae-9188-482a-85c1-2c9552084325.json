Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that economic growth in the last quarter of 2007 slowed to 0.6% from 0.7% in the previous quarter - its weakest rate in over a year. Minutes from the Bank's monetary policy committee meeting on January 9-10 revealed that only David Blanchflower voted for an interest rate cut this month while the other eight members voted to keep rates unchanged at 5.5%, arguing that the outlook for inflation had \"worsened markedly\". \"For most members, no change in the bank rate was necessary this month,\" the minutes said. \"A second period during which inflation was significantly above target so soon after the one in spring 2007, might be more likely to lead people to revise up their expectations of future inflation.\" The breakdown of voting was more hawkish than the City expected. Analysts had predicted the decision to be a closer call with a 7-2 vote in favour of unchanged rates. The content of the minutes sent London share prices tumbling yesterday, down from an earlier recovery. This is because they provided another sign that the Bank is likely to take a more cautious approach to cutting interest rates unlike the US Federal Reserve which has slashed rates. Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, hinted in a speech on Tuesday night that the MPC was determined to keep inflation on track at 2% and that some volatility could not be avoided in the short term. \"The re-pricing of risk that is still continuing is not a process that we should try to reverse,\" he said. The minutes showed that the policymakers who voted to keep rates on hold felt a cut was inappropriate at a time when the decline in sterling against most other currencies was already easing monetary policy. Blanchflower argued that the US outlook had materially worsened, meaning the risk of a sharp and persistent slowdown in Britain had increased. He added there was little sign that wage bargainers would seek higher pay and feed inflation pressures and thought an immediate rate cut was warranted. His fears of a cooling economy were reflected in the ONS data which showed that on an annual basis, growth in the fourth quarter was 2.9%, down from 3.3% in the year to the third quarter. However, performance for 2007 as a whole held up at 3.1%, the strongest since 2004. But there were signs of dark clouds for the UK with a significant slowdown in the services sector, which forms three-quarters of the economy. The main reason for this was weakening business and financial services growth. The sector recorded the lowest quarterly growth since the second quarter of 2003. The broad services sector grew 0.7% on the quarter, compared to 0.8% in the previous three months. Analysts said that despite the tone of the minutes, mounting evidence of a tough year for UK growth would encourage policymakers to bring interest rates down, albeit more gradually. \"We stand by our view that rates will come down again next month - barring a sudden deterioration in the growth outlook - the monetary policy committee is unlikely to ease aggressively,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. \"The fact that growth in the fourth quarter held up relatively well supports that view.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
