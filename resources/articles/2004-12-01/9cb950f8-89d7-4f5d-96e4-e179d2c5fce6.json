Asked if there could have been an outrage in London similar to that in Madrid where rush-hour bombings killed nearly 200 people, Sir John replied \"Yes. I can't discuss it because of court proceedings, but yes we have stopped a Madrid.\" Sir John was speaking to the BBC's John Gaunt. Later, Scotland Yard said that in the interview Sir John had made it clear that he did not necessarily mean that any thwarted attack on London would have taken the form of an attack on trains. In the interview Sir John said: \"The risk of an attack to London has not changed; an attack is still inevitable. Thank God to date, and we have had to work extremely hard, we've thwarted attacks\". Sir John also said one of the major issues affecting London was knives. He went on: \"We've got a big problem with knives. We've driven down gun crime but I think there has been a move over to knives. \"If people are carrying a knife for the wrong reasons, ie to inflict personal damage, then I think they should receive a mandatory sentence of two if not three years.\" Sir John is stepping down as commissioner on January 31 and deputy commissioner Sir Ian Blair will be the force's next chief. When asked what his biggest regret was during his time as commissioner Sir John mentioned the case of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor. He said: \"Having been a career detective and having dealt with murders it was just the circumstances of that case. \"Any murder is tragic and horrible but having seen the family and having got close to them that was a case that haunts me in a way. We are still hopeful and will keep ploughing on.\" Four youths were cleared of Damilola's murder at the Old Bailey in April 2002."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
