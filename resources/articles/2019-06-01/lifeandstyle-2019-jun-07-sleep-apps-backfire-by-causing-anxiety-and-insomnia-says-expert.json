Speaking at the Cheltenham science festival, Dr Guy Leschziner, a sleep disorder specialist and consultant at Guy\u2019s hospital in London, said a growing preoccupation with getting enough sleep was backfiring. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of people who have developed significant insomnia as a result of either sleep trackers or reading certain things about how devastating sleep deprivation is for you,\u201d Leschziner said before his talk. A high proportion of patients seeking treatment for insomnia turn up at his clinic with data about their sleep patterns and are often reluctant to delete the app, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s rather difficult to dissuade them from using it.\u201d Most apps have not been clinically validated and only track movement, so do not provide insight into the quality of sleep, he added. \u201cMy view of sleep trackers is fairly cynical. If you wake up feeling tired and you\u2019ve had an unrefreshing night\u2019s sleep then you know you\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you wake up every day and feel refreshed, are awake throughout the day and are ready to sleep at the same time every night then you\u2019re probably getting enough sleep for you and you don\u2019t need an app to tell you that.\u201d Similar concerns were highlighted in a series of case studies published last year by a team in Chicago that described patients whose micromanagement of sleep using apps had led to a disorder called orthosomnia. Research shows that for most people the optimum amount of sleep is around eight hours, but this varies widely across the population. For people who naturally need less sleep, being alerted to the fact that they are not sleeping \u201cenough\u201d could result in the nocebo effect, where the expectation of negative symptoms leads to people actually feeling worse. Speaking in the same session at the festival, Stephanie Romiszewski, a sleep psychologist based in Exeter, said: \u201cEverybody sleeps differently and can have a different duration. And therefore if you take a generic sleep tracker and it [says] you haven\u2019t had the right amount of sleep, that can start to worry you.\u201d Some cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) apps, however, have been found to be effective in treating insomnia in trials. The festival was told that people should also take a relaxed approach to advice on caffeine consumption and blue light exposure before bedtime. \u201cCaffeine is only applicable if caffeine disrupts your sleep,\u201d said Leschziner. \u201cThere are genes that influence how your brain processes caffeine and so there are many people who drink two or three cups of espresso before they go to bed and not have any impact at all on their sleep.\u201d Genetics also influence the extent to which blue light disrupts the evening peak in the sleep hormone, melatonin. \u201cIf your sleep is a really good quality and you can sit there and watch Netflix until 11 o\u2019clock at night, close your computer and then drift off to sleep and have a great night\u2019s sleep then you don\u2019t need to worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that sensitivity to blue light various tremendously.\u201d Leshchziner said measuring sleep was part of a broader tendency to \u201cmetricise our lives\u201d using technology to count how many steps we have taken, how many online friends we have and how we spend our money. With sleep, this trend is particularly problematic, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re measuring your steps and you realise you\u2019re not walking as far as you should you just do a bit more exercise. When you get into that obsessive state about sleep it makes sleep even more difficult.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
