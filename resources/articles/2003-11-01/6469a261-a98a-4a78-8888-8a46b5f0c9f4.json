Education watchdog Ofsted said the number of schools placed on \"special measures\" because their performance was so poor stood at 46 in October, up from 34 last year. The number of schools judged to have \"serious weaknesses\" jumped 30% to 39 from 30 a year ago, according to figures Ofsted gave to the House of Commons education select committee. The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, said while it was too early to make firm judgments, the underlying causes were likely to be the same as they were in the mid to late 1990s, when the number of failing schools reached its peak - poor teaching and inadequate management. \"I think what concerns me is that some of the issues emerging led to schools getting into difficulties five years ago and 10 years ago, but let's not judge and make too many conclusions,\" he told reporters. From his reading of their last inspection reports, these schools were likely to be failing due to a combination of factors, he went on. \"It is, dare I say it, a rather predictable load of problems - teaching not very good, leadership and management poor, governors not holding the school to account.\" Once a school is judged by inspectors to have serious weaknesses, they keep a close eye on its progress, implementing a specially drawn up \"action plan\". If the school fails to improve, they can be placed on special measures. If it still cannot meet improvement targets, it can be closed by the education secretary, Charles Clarke. In September, Ofsted modified some aspects of the inspection process. The director of inspection, David Taylor, confirmed to MPs that schools where most teaching was judged to be \"satisfactory\" could still be told they must do better. \"If there's an unrelieved diet of education which never rises above the midpoint of a seven-point scale overall, this is not a situation which is good enough, which is satisfactory.\" A spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills said: \"David Bell has made very clear that it is too early to draw any conclusions from these figures. \" We have cut the number of failing schools and there has been a very significant decrease in the number of schools in special measures from 515 in 97/98 to 282 02/03. \" Also, instances of schools that consistently have a very high proportion of pupils failing to achieve five or more A-star to C grades have been virtually eliminated. \" However, we continue to be relentless in targeting underperformance to raise standards in all schools.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
