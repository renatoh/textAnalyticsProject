Rain sluiced down the windows. I was pleased because they are now perfectly clean. It is the pinpricks of rain that shower the glass with salt that need a hose job in order to see out. Off we set for our local beach, Bishop's Quarter. There were three lines of seaweed, the one nearest the sea being the last, marking the lowest tide. There must have been hundreds of pouches, like medieval drawstring bags. They were of all sizes, from thumbnail size to almost 90cm wide. The colours too were varied; light brown to dark, to black and a shade I'd seldom seen before, bitter green. I found a bitter green one with a piece of delicate pink dulse draped around it. They were of course all empty of the little creatures they once held as they floated to and fro in the ocean. Among them lay the egg masses of whelks and everywhere laminaria (seaweeds), some still attached to their mooring rocks, the rocks ripped out of the storm-struck waters. Further ahead, near a sandy space between rocks, about 20 brent geese were swimming and feeding at the edge of the waves. On our return I noticed little bunches of carageen. It looks so beautifully fragile, with its fine tendrils, that it is a wonder it survives the destructive force of the Atlantic storms. It was always respected and gathered as a remedy for coughs and respiratory ailments. This was the season for harvesting the carageen and throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, at low tides, most of the people of our western coast set out to collect this seaweed; old people, women and children would be busy among the rocks taking all that their hands could grasp. It was then spread out to dry, later turned over to bleach. Some was kept for medicinal purposes and the rest sold. It smokes if piled up, I'm told."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
