It was Doug Gansler, the newly elected Democratic attorney general from Maryland, a state normally reduced to irrelevancy by the time the American presidential nomination calendar reaches it. A supporter of Barack Obama, Gansler was in celebratory spirits after Obama's eight-point win over John Edwards and Hillary Clinton. Gansler had emerged as a minor celebrity in Obama circles during the final, gruelling days in Iowa. Though serving only as a volunteer willing to do his share of grunt work, Obama staffers told me the ebullient 47-year-old quickly developed a reputation as a rally-the-troops cheerleader for the staff and other volunteers. Because the intense battle for the nomination that has emerged between Obama and fellow senator Hillary Clinton continues without a clear winner, Maryland now moves into the political spotlight - a fact that should cause the Obama campaign to break into some cheering of its own. For at least on paper, few states are as favourable to Obama's candidacy as this one named for an English queen. The reason Maryland ought to be a can't-miss state for Obama is that the state's Democratic voters are well-educated and upscale - \"wine track\" voters, to use a term widely bandied about during this year's Democratic contest. That is, the state is teeming with precisely the type of Democrats whom the rookie senator has thus far succeeded in rallying to his campaign. Gansler, in fact, is the very embodiment of a white Obama voter. He's young (by statewide elected official standards, at least), male, Ivy League college-educated, and he earned his political chops as a state's attorney in Montgomery County - Maryland's richest county and perennially among the top 10 wealthiest areas nationwide. High graduation rates and household wealth, however, are hardly limited to Maryland's white residents: The state not only boasts the largest African-American population share of any non-Confederate state, at almost 30%, but one of the most affluent. The US House district represented by Democrat Al Wynn, which comprises parts of District of Columbia-bordering Montgomery and Prince George's counties, is the wealthiest majority-minority district in the country. Clinton will not be shut out entirely in Maryland on Tuesday. Though Obama is expected to dominate the urban precincts of Baltimore city and the suburban Democratic strongholds of the DC-area counties, critical \"beer track\" voters from the Baltimore suburbs and the less population-dense Eastern Shore and Western Maryland counties should produce a significant share of the vote for the former first lady. But, overall, there are far fewer Democrats in these areas. The New York senator may also benefit from a slight advantage in electoral endorsements. Though Obama has received the announced support of more state legislators, in addition to that of Gansler, Wynn, Maryland's other African-American congressman Elijah Cummings and state comptroller Peter Franchot, Clinton has been endorsed by fellow US senator Barbara Mikulski and first-term governor Martin O'Malley. Both Mikulski and O'Malley have been able to draw support in parts of the state often hostile to Democrats and among working-class white voters who have proved thus far to be the backbone of Clinton's electoral coalition. Nevertheless, Maryland is shaping up to be something of a home match for Obama. The most recent Mason-Dixon poll in the state shows Obama up 18 percentage points over Clinton, 53% to 35%. Both campaigns recognise Obama's advantage, if their schedules are any indication. Though Obama has two late rallies today, he hasn't spent much time in-state. Clinton has been running two television ads here, but, aside from some late events today as well, she too has relied on surrogates - including her husband, who appeared at a slate of events on Sunday - to do most of her campaigning. Meanwhile, as the quintessential wine-track state in America, Maryland's long-awaited chance to matter to the Democratic nomination process has been soured by the vinegary reality that neighbouring Virginia is receiving greater attention for its more competitive contest.
