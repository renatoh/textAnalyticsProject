The fund manager had been suspended amid allegations that she was planning to defect to a rival. She ended up at French-owned Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale before setting up her own outfit, Bramdean, last year. So when it emerged recently that over tea at the Ritz she had expressed an interest in obtaining sales particulars for the UK arm of Deutsche's asset management outfit, the story was irresistible. It turns out, however, that her advances are anything but irresistible to the Germans. Deutsche has decided not to let Horlick - and a couple of other small firms - have access to the financial data that might have allowed them to table a formal bid. Horlick, no doubt, is unimpressed, but cannot be surprised. Given the choice of a big player with obvious financial resources or a small player with unidentified backers (in Horlick's case rumoured to be venture capitalists Apax), most vendors would probably lean towards the former. But in this case there has to be a suspicion that Deutsche is acting partly out of spite rather than on purely financial grounds. Calculated risk American drug regulators recently issued a comforting report on Astra- Zeneca's cholesterol-lowering potion Crestor, so calls yesterday from consumer lobbyist Public Citizen for the drug to be banned were easily dismissed. Public's data, however, warrants closer examination. The group has looked at the number of reports of a potentially fatal muscle wasting disease, rhabdomyolysis, related to both Crestor and other drugs of the same class, known as statins. It says, bluntly, that the risk with Crestor rises sixfold. Public is seen in some quarters as a maverick operation, constantly haranguing the pharmaceuticals industry. Yet Sanford Bernstein, a rather sober American investment bank, did a similar exercise and came to the same conclusion: the side-effects are significantly more frequent, although still rare. The bank's analysis is measured. It acknowledges that such reports can be biased, and that more data is needed to draw a definite conclusion about the drug's safety. AstraZeneca points out that US regulators have more information than outsiders, and they have backed the drug. Even so, doctors might look at either independent analysis and question whether, in certain circumstances, they should prescribe Crestor when there are other, less controversial drugs on the market. Indeed, one popular statin, Zocor, is about to go off patent and will be significantly cheaper than its rivals. Public's calls for an outright ban may fall on deaf ears, yet the chances of Crestor becoming a true pharmaceutical blockbuster seem to be receding. Bubble berth The dotcom boom held the promise of massive wealth. For a handful it even turned out to be true. While the world's financial markets digest the bloody aftermath of the Nasdaq peak five years ago, so the annual Forbes ranking of billionaires arrives to remind us that the Great Millennium Bubble managed to create at least some lasting wealth, giving a fortunate few a berth among the oil barons, real estate tycoons and members of the Wal-Mart family. The wealthiest of the dotcom entrepreneurs is the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, reputedly worth $9.9bn (\u00a35.1bn), 35th in the list, who now lives a quiet life in Nevada. Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com founder, is ranked 136th and worth an estimated $4.1bn. David Filo, co-founder of Yahoo! comes in at 188th with $3.1bn, while his partner in the business, Jerry Yang, is ranked 228th and worth $2.6bn. Google has created at least four billionaires according to the list, including co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, worth $7.2bn apiece. Eric Schmidt, chief executive of the ubiquitous search engine, is reckoned to have $2.8bn - at least on paper. Sitting pretty Just how fortunate are the 3,300 staff bought into the John Lewis Partnership when Waitrose acquired 19 former Safeway stores? Until March last year they worked for Safeway, a business in steep decline with no future. They then passed into the hands of Sir Ken Morrison, as part of his Wm Morrison empire. We are not suggesting that Sir Ken is mean, but he is known for his tight control on the wage bill - from the boardroom down. And there are bloggers out there whose sole mission is to tell the world how miserable it is to work for Morrisons. Even if untrue, it is hardly encouraging. But Sir Ken couldn't keep all the Safeway stores and Waitrose moved in for 19 of them. For the staff involved it was definitely third time lucky. Yesterday they heard that they would share in the annual John Lewis bonus - seven weeks pay - pro rata for the time they have been part of the partnership. John Lewis also owns holiday homes for employees to use and runs golf and sailing clubs. But the really big plus is its non-contributory final salary pension scheme - the only one left in the retail business. They must be chuffed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
