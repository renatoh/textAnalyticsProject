With a landslide in Sunday\u2019s elections, he now impose his will more resolutely than ever before, making certain that the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) extends its writ over the country another four years. He gambled, crossed many lines, and won. He has now the half of the national vote on his side to argue for legitimacy and perhaps even as carte blanche to extend his rule into autocracy. This was a result that a very few had predicted. Most pollsters had tipped the AKP gaining around 44% of the vote, short of being able to form a government on its own. So for the AKP to come away with the scale of the victory it was a shock. The other conundrum was whether the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democracy party (HDP) would fall below the critical 10% threshold (to enter parliament). It managed to score above that the relief of many who had been concerned that the Kurdish movement out of parliament would destabilise Turkey further. How to explain AKP\u2019s victory? The AKP invested intensely in portraying itself as the main political force waging war against what many see as the Turkey\u2019s number one enemy: the pro-Kurdish PKK. Erdo\u011fan played on the sharp divisions between the three opposition parties, all entrenched in identity politics. He skillfully steered talks aiming to build a coalition after June\u2019s parliamentary election into a dead end, while also declaring war on the PKK. Supporters of the ultra-nationalist MHP, whose leader Devlet Bah\u00e7eli was declared as \u201cMr No\u201d because of his rejection of any offer of a coalition, turned to the AKP, losing the party six percentage points in support. Another dramatic element in this historic election is the number of votes that the HDP lost. Under the leadership of Selahattin Demirta\u015f, the party had managed to reach beyond identity politics and appealing more widely to the secular left. But the clashes between the Turkish government and the Kurdish opposition seem to have resulted, in those secular-left voters supporting the main opposition Republican People\u2019s party (CHP). So it was a strategy of portraying Turkey as being in crisis that Erdo\u011fan pursued successfully. He also successfully cowed the media and narrowed the scope for the opposition to put its case, constructing an image of a warrior at home and a man of defiance to the world. Yet, with this result, Turkey will not approach stability, instead its systemic crisis will deepen. What was at stake in these elections was whether Turkey would emerge from them closer to a western-style democracy, or a central Asian-style autocracy, under which freedoms and rights would be disrespected, and, the judiciary and the media would be subordinated to power. If Erdo\u011fan and his AKP decide that the election victory can serve as carte blanche for breaches of constitution, crushing of dissent, suffocating journalism, pursuing a disputed presidential system, suppressing Kurdish demands for devolution, and zigzagging on Syrian crisis, then we should expect an even more rapid slide to autocracy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
