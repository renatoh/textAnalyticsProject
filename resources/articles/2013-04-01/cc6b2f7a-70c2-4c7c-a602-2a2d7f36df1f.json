Three-nil against Sheffield United. Good game, but it didn't really matter. A 10-point penalty from the FA on account of their catastrophic finances meant their freefall from Premier League to League Two would continue unbroken. But for the fans it was something else. It was their first victory as owners. After administration had followed a series of overseas owners with no previous Portsmouth connection, Pompey supporters stumped up serious cash \u2013 \u00a31,000 a share \u2013 and pulled in local businesses and the city of Portsmouth itself. They came up with a formula that satisfied the Football League and ended a 14-month spell in administration. Now it's joined a small but distinguished band of clubs evading the curse of the exploitative proprietor. For Portsmouth, like Wrexham, it was a last gasp. But Premier League darlings Swansea are also 20% fan-owned. Maybe it's not quite the Bundesliga. But give it time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
