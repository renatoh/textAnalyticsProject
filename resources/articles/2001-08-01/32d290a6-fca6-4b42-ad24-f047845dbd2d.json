Naturally, each theory must be treated with scepticism, sometimes even contempt. But there are some eyebrow-arching facts amid the most recent Hamilton imbroglio. For a start there is the link between Neil Hamilton's old foe Mohamed Al Fayed and the publicist Max Clifford, who has advised the woman who claims the Hamiltons were involved in her alleged sexual assault. It may all be coincidence. Perhaps the community of scandal is smaller than we think. But then again ... The disgraced politician and the millionaire Neil Hamilton still owes millionaire Mohamed Al Fayed more than \u00a31m, following a failed libel action after the Harrods chief said the then Tory minister had sought and received cash for asking parliamentary questions on his behalf. The disgraced former MP for Tatton will soon move out of his luxurious Cheshire home, which he has had to sell following his defeat in the libel action he brought against Mr Fayed in 1999. Mr Hamilton is said to have debts in excess of \u00a32m and was declared bankrupt in May this year following a petition for bankruptcy filed by Mr Fayed. A proportion of the money that Mr Hamilton earns must go to his creditors, of which Mr Fayed is a notable presence. Mr Hamilton and his wife, Christine, have tried to reinvent themselves as media personalities, appearing on Have I Got News For You, and negotiating other money-spinning deals which the Sunday Telegraph reported could have earned them around \u00a3100,000 in the past two years. The alleged victim and the PR man Nadine Milroy-Sloan, a 27-year-old college lecturer, approached the publicist Max Clifford with the story of her alleged sexual abuse. Mr Clifford says he advised her to go to the police. Ms Miroy-Sloan claims that she was raped by Barry Lehaney, a man who she claims was the Hamiltons' \"chauffeur\" whom she had met at on an internet chat site. She alleges that the Hamiltons committed indecent acts while Mr Lehaney raped her. The Hamiltons and Mr Lehaney strongly deny the allegations. The Hamiltons have embarked on a high-profile, high-risk strategy, telling the media they had been arrested, claiming the news would have leaked out anyway and they were seizing the initiative. Ms Miroy-Sloan has waived her right to anonymity. The PR man and the millionaire Mr Clifford has worked for Mr Fayed, advising him in his attempt to get a British passport and in promoting Fulham, the Premiership football club owned by the Egyptian-born tycoon. Asked about rumours that Mr Fayed was involved in the scandal, Mr Clifford said: \"Let's play this stupid allegation down. The first Mohamed knew about this was when he phoned me.\" Mr Fayed said it \"could not happen to a nicer couple\" on hearing the news, according to Mr Clifford. The Hamiltons and the media The couple are thought to have been paid as much as \u00a310,000 by a national newspaper for the surprisingly full details of their police \"humiliation\" following their arrest two weeks ago. The Hamiltons met the Mail on Sunday' s investigations editor, Paul Henderson, within minutes of leaving Barkingside police station, Essex, on Friday August 10. Mr Henderson spent time with the Hamiltons, at the same time as the BBC documentary maker Louis Theroux, who has remained an almost constant companion throughout the saga. Mr Henderson persuaded the couple to hand over the recordings of their police interviews that Mrs Hamilton had demanded making, using a tape lent to them by the BBC production team. The legal threat Mr Hamilton, no stranger to courtrooms, has said it was too early to say if the couple planned to sue the police, saying: \"No options are excluded.\" Today he claimed that evidence of a call made by Mrs Hamilton on her mobile telephone put the couple nowhere near the scene at the time of the alleged attack. The couple are demanding that the police drop their investigation. Mr Hamilton said he would be consulting his lawyer, and threatened that the longer the investigation lasted the \"less lenient\" he would be to the police. Legal experts said that, if the Hamiltons did successfully sue for unlawful arrest, they could expect a six-figure payout. Ironically, any damages would mostly be passed to Mr Fayed.
