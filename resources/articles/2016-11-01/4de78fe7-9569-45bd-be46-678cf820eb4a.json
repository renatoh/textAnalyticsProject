Government and rebel negotiators announced late on Saturday in Havana that they had agreed on a host of modifications to the original deal, taking into account objections from different sectors of society that campaigned against it, led by former rightwing president \u00c1lvaro Uribe. \u201cWe have reached a new final accord to end the armed conflict that integrates changes, precisions and proposals suggested by the most diverse sectors of society,\u201d the two sides said in a statement. The government, which had insisted that the first agreement was the \u201cbest deal possible\u201d, admitted it had improved. \u201cI humbly recognise that this agreement is better,\u201d Humberto de la Calle, the government\u2019s chief negotiator, said. \u201cWe understood the importance of reformulating [the agreement] with a broader consensus that incorporates many voices that were absent during the negotiating process,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, the Farc lead negotiator. Colombian voters rejected that deal in a plebiscite on 2 October, sending negotiators back to the drawing board. Although the text of the new agreement was not immediately published, the president, Juan Manuel Santos, laid out certain changes in a televised speech. Some are little more than clarifications of the often-vague language of the text. Other modifications are more substantial. Under the new agreement, Farc commits to declare and hand over all their assets, which will be used for reparations to victims of the conflict, a provision not included in the first accord and demanded by leaders of the no vote. Many Colombians who rejected the deal said they did so because they wanted to see guerrillas behind bars for the thousands of kidnappings and killings they were responsible for. The new agreement does not include jail time for former rebels but better defines the kinds of alternative punishment they will face under a special tribunal that will prosecute war crimes, according to Santos. Critics had also balked at the idea of convicted criminals being able to hold public office. That provision remains unaltered in the new deal. Santos defended the issue. \u201cThe reason for all peace processes in the world is precisely so that guerrillas leave their arms and can participate in politics legally,\u201d he said. It is not clear whether Santos will risk a new plebiscite to ratify the agreement or ask congress to approve it but even before the new text was published critics tweeted their objections. \u201cThe new agreement continues to include Farc members of congress who don\u2019t need votes to be elected. Absurd and unacceptable,\u201d tweeted Vanesa Vallejo. Political analyst Ramiro Bejarano said the continued criticism from those who have opposed the peace process was predictable. \u201cTheir strategy is to torpedo peace,\u201d he tweeted. On congratulating Colombia on the new deal as an \u201cimportant step forward\u201d, US secretary of state John Kerry said continued dissent was understandable. \u201cAfter 52 years of war, no peace agreement can satisfy everyone in every detail,\u201d he said in a statement. Uribe, who championed the no vote in the referendum, did not immediately react to the new accord other than to say it should be open to review."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
