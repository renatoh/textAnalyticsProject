His mission: to rescue his fellow fowl from the hideous clutches of the factory owner, Billy Buxted. These tales of derring-do were told to us by my dad, who developed his rich fantasy life at the monotonous conveyor belt he once monitored in a poultry factory. If you want to feed your children's imaginations, you could do worse than visiting a storytelling festival. These weekend events are dotted around the country - I recently attended Festival at the Edge (Fate) in Shropshire, where words weave their magic around a big bonfire set against a backdrop of outstanding natural beauty. Armed with nothing but your imagination, a pair of wellies and a magic tent (the ones that boing into shape when you throw on the ground, narrowly avoiding your face), you can take in some excellent performances by tale tellers from all over the world. Fate has a children's programme running alongside the adult one, but kids are generally welcome at all performances \u2013 barring the more risqu\u00e9 ones in the evening. It's not just storytelling, though - there are plenty of other activities going on. Take the circus tent, a ginormous, multicoloured, beribboned and bejewelled big top filled to bursting with wonderful trinkets, gadgets, widgets and knick-knacks. Here you can drop a Diablo, stumble on stilts or fall stylishly off a unicycle \u2013 a sorely underrated skill. Once you've decided that running away to join the circus is not a wise career move, you can eat at one of the delicious and generally healthy food stalls. We tried some organic burgers from a local farm, and indulged in a pint of real ale from the Camra tent. Other afternoon activities included a mask-making workshop. Long tables were filled to overflowing with piles of colourful feathers, glue, glitter paints and paper. Each child was given a mask to decorate within a theme of woodland magical beings, such as fairies, nymphs and goblins. Once finished the masks were hung around the tent for everyone to see. For \u00a33 children could also have their faces painted by a professional, and we later took a merry troupe of butterflies and tigers to watch a music act. Nightfall brought candlelit processions, music and storytelling. The first evening at Fate saw a festival regular, Peter Chand, take to the stage. Accompanied by music, actions and dancing from Sohan Kailey and the Bhangra Dance Jam, Peter told the colourful story of a mouse family trying to find a husband for their relationship-challenged daughter. Peter's thick Black Country accent made it all the more comedic \u2013 like Lenny Henry back in the days when he was funny. A refrain of 'What, what what!', occurring every time some dastardly cad turned down a marriage proposal, was particularly effective. The next day, Annamation, a trio of young ladies wearing fluorescent bobbed wigs, stripy socks and pink lippy (mildly frightening for all the adults at 10am) rocked the Children's Marquee with an alternative version of Jason and the Argonauts. Kids came up on stage to act out various parts \u2013 the flame-breathing bulls or Princess Medea - and difficult Greek names were pronounced by rhyming and sounding out the syllables with exaggerated actions. My mother, a former primary school teacher, commented that if history lessons were taught like this, you'd remember a lot more. Older children and teenagers can enjoy the opportunity to wander around a safe and beautiful site without the parenting equivalent of the Eye of Mordor swivelling over them. Their interests are also catered for - Fate hosted a performance by The Urban Gypsies, a dance troupe decked out in raggle-taggle, colourful clothes. I lost cool points at this stage, having never heard of them. Apparently they were the stars of 'Britain's Got Talent', where Simon Cowell told one of the bustier members of the troupe to buy a sports bra. He had a point. Once the kids are in bed (after bedtime stories, of course) the grown-ups are catered for. If you're not storied out, you can take a seat in the red tent and listen to tales with more ribald themes. Or you can go for a bop and a pint in the beer tent whilst listening to live music. We took the ultimate rock'n'roll option: playing travel bingo back at our tent. Over to you If you're interested in attending a storytelling festival, it costs around \u00a370 for an adult weekend ticket, or \u00a3130 - \u00a3180 for a family weekend ticket (so there's value in taking the kids along!). Here are some forthcoming events: \u00b7 Devon's hills will echo with the oral tradition of tales, fables, music and poetry at the sixth West Country Storytelling Festival from September 5-7 \u00b7 The Scottish International Storytelling Festival takes place from October 24-November 2 in Edinburgh, and will feature storytellers from Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden in a 'Northlands and Sagalands' themed event \u00b7 Visit picturesque Lough Gur Storytelling Festival from October 24-27 in Limerick, western Ireland, with stories of witchcraft and lots of activities for children"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
