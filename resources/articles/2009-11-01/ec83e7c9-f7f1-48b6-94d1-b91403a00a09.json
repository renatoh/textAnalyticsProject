People will question us getting into the Champions League, but it's nice proving people wrong in life. I'm not giving up on the Champions League. It's not impossible. It's all about a couple of points. \"Those three we were missing are fantastic players. Modric is world-class, Lennon is a threat when he gets the ball and goes at people, and Defoe has been in absolutely incredible form this year for Spurs and England. It has cost us dearly, his getting sent off at Portsmouth. Chelsea and Manchester United are the strongest teams, but I would not write off Arsenal, Liverpool, Aston Villa or Manchester City [or Spurs], it's so tight. It will be a good scrap this year between six or seven teams.\" \u2022 Paul Hayward: Spurs lack top four quality \u2022 David Pleat: Arsenal too fluid for Spurs \u2022 Dominic Fifield's match report from the Emirates \u2022 In pictures: the best of the North London derby The anticipated return to fitness of Jonathan Woodgate has now been countered by the hamstring tear that S\u00e9bastien Bassong suffered at the Emirates, an injury that is expected to keep the Frenchman out for up to six weeks. The \u00a38m signing from Newcastle conceded that the defeat to Arsenal served as a reminder of the standards Tottenham must attain if they are to unsettle the established elite at the top, with Spurs having managed a solitary clean sheet in 11 league games to date this season. \"This game just proved that we need to keep working and really work every day,\" said Bassong. \"When you see that game, we can't stop at this level. If we stop working, we will be disappointed again and again. So to be in the top four we need more, much more. If we want to be in the top four, we have to win against these teams \u2013 against Arsenal, United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City \u2013 and, if we don't, it's going to be difficult. \"That was the worst day of the season. In one minute we messed up the whole of our game. We made two mistakes and we lost the game. That was the difference. We lost our concentration for one minute and the game was lost. We've got a very big quality in the squad and we can still look to take that fourth position in the table, but we need to work hard, stay focused and we need to improve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
