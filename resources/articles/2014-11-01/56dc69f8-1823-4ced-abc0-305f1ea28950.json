United go into Sunday\u2019s 168th Manchester derby looking to avenge last season\u2019s heavy defeats to City but United\u2019s manager said City will need much more success to join his current employers and his former clubs Barcelona and Bayern Munich among the game\u2019s superpowers. While City beat United 4-1 and 3-0 last season, finished 22 points ahead of their neighbours and won a second league title in three years, Van Gaal believes their support shows the true size of United. Van Gaal said: \u201cAbroad we have more fans and followers on social media. Also Bayern Munich is the biggest club of Germany. The same thing for Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain. It [would take] a long time for Manchester City to reach that level.\u201d United have won 20 league titles, to City\u2019s four, and have been champions of Europe three times, whereas their rivals have never progressed beyond the last 16 of the Champions League. But Pellegrini, who expressed an interest in adding Steven Gerrard to his squad should the Liverpool captain leave Anfield, argues history matters less than modern-day results. City have won five of the last six league derbies, outscoring United 18-6. Pellegrini said: \u201cIf you just go by the success of the last years, this team won two of the last three titles and we were runners-up in the other. Manchester United have a lot of stories of winning an important amount of titles. Maybe football is in the present and I think in the last two or three years, this team has done better.\u201d Looking to the future, Pellegrini said 34-year-old Gerrard \u2013 who indicated last week he planned to play on beyond the end of his current Liverpool contract \u2013 could help continue that dominance. \u201cI don\u2019t ever rate players on their age. It depends on the money they cost and the number of years they have left on their contract but, like Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard is a top player who can continue at a high level for a number of years.\u201d City\u2019s recent Manchester derby record features 7-1 aggregate triumphs twice in the last three years. Pellegrini admitted he was shocked by the pace and scale of United\u2019s decline last season, when the champions slumped to finish seventh after David Moyes\u2019s ill-fated reign, meaning they are not playing Champions League football for the first time since the 1995-96 season. He added: \u201cIt was a surprise for everyone because they had a very good squad and very successful years with Sir Alex Ferguson [in charge].\u201d City have lost back-to-back games, to West Ham United in the Premier League and Newcastle United in the Capital One Cup after a Champions League draw at CSKA Moscow, and while Pellegrini declared he is happy for them to be favourites, Van Gaal wondered whether United can capitalise on their plight. He added: \u201cIt can be better to play now against Manchester City, I see that like that, but on the other side, they shall be more motivated to play against Manchester United because they are also looking for a good result, like us.\u201d City will be without their creator-in-chief David Silva, who has been ruled out for up to four weeks, but Van Gaal pointed to United\u2019s many absentees this season and insisted the Spaniard\u2019s knee ligament injury should not be used as a mitigating factor if they do not win. \u201cWe are used to having injured players because we have [had] seven players injured all season. So what can I say? They have one player injured and they are out of the match.\u201d United will welcome their skipper back after suspension and Van Gaal added: \u201cWe have also [Wayne] Rooney, who was away for three matches. He is my captain; he is also a playmaker; he can score. I haven\u2019t mentioned that, not in any interview. It is no excuse.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
