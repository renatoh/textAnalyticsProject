If George V could see the place now! Since his supposed dying words, the town's been synonymous with the sadder side of seaside fun: old people's homes, staring out to sea, death. But, like every seaside town on its uppers, Bognor's only gone and got itself a masterplan. Alas, geriatrics and convalescent homes, however regal, don't rake it in like moneyed metrosexuals. Ergo, \u00a3100m's going on shops, offices, cinemas, new homes (\"apartments\", mind, not flats), a new theatre, yadda, yadda, yadda. And, get this, another \u00a3400m for Bognor Marina. Doesn't trip off the tongue, does it? Ups \"The royal family in fact liked the town,\" one Bognor website toots defensively. And, yes, elegant chunks remain of Sir Richard Hotham's late 18th-century plan to turn Bognor - or, as he preferred, Hothampton - into Brighton without the oiks. Developers are sniffing around and there's fresh paint in the air, but don't expect miracles. Still, no place beside the South Downs and with a beach can be that bad. Downs Are there enough moneyed metrosexuals to go round every fading seaside resort in Britain? Beware the PR puff. Think long-term: 2013's the date for completion. There are still pockets of deprivation. Getting around Road: the A27, A3 and A24 not bad. Rail: on a slovenly branch line; you even have to change to travel five miles to Chichester (25 minutes/thrice hourly). Time out Hotham Arts Centre, though avant garde it ain't: Acker Bilk, wrestling, the Barron Knights (still going!). An independent cinema. Hotham Park's nice. Lots of festivals, too.
