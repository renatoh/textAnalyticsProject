Justin: Mine is buying watches. I've got a vintage Patek Philippe, which was passed down by my late father. And I won a vintage Rolex at a fair just outside Birmingham. Now I'm desperate to find a Gucci 80s watch with a round face and a green-and-red strap. And I've got a fabulous Chanel glossy white watch that Colin bought for me. Colin: My weakness is Bond Street. I love Chanel. I've got the black watch and the ring that matches it. J: And who bought you that, Colin? C: You bought me that ... Does shopping make you happy? J: Shopping is the elixir of life. If ever anything is wrong - within reason - there is nothing that lifts a mood better than a wander down your local high street. I'm a wonderful shopper and I'm great at shopping for other people. I'm gifted. We take our friends out and submit them to our own personal makeover. It's a hoot. How would you describe your shopping styles? C: Focused. I always think, do I need this, will I use it? J: Eclectic. I go absolutely everywhere. I love to put things together. What's your top tip? C: Leave London. Things are cheaper away from the south of England. We bought a Robin Day table and four chairs from a Salvation Army store in Glasgow for \u00a320. In TK Maxx in Glasgow, I found a Missoni dressing gown for \u00a330, like a gift from God. What's the last thing you bought? C: We've just purchased a penthouse in Toronto. The next thing you'll buy? J: We've just put a down payment on a vintage Mercedes in Canada. We've got this flat but an empty car port ... Colin and Justin's Home Show runs on Wednesdays at 2pm on UKTV Style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
