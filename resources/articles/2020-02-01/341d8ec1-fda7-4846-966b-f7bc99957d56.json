Hayes does not style herself on Brian Clough, though she may literally by wearing a green shirt in tribute, but she sees his influence in her teams and they way she conducts herself. \u201cMy father loves him and watched his teams a lot, and live. I went to a lot of Nottingham Forest games live when they were in London, so I\u2019ve grown up always admiring his football, the type of football and his straight-talking, I guess. \u201cI always think outspoken gets used \u2013 it gets misused. I find it refreshing to hear some honesty. That was a time where there probably was more honesty than there is now with managers. Let\u2019s not forget he produced some brilliant football teams and is most remembered for that, I hope.\u201d Hayes is definitely outspoken and it is a refreshing quality. In October, before Chelsea played Crystal Palace in the group stage, Hayes proclaimed the Football Association should \u201cget rid of the Continental Cup\u201d in favour of more league fixtures, saying: \u201cSell the Women\u2019s Super League; why are we diluting our product?\u201d Now the tune has changed a little. It is not a complete switch, but as Chelsea have progressed so have Hayes\u2019s views on the competition. \u201cI like [games] being played midweek \u2013 it allows us to play some younger players in the earlier stages of the competition. I think if it is to remain then hopefully that will remain. \u201cI\u2019m an advocate of more games not less games. More games for me means more opportunities for younger players. So the Conti Cup, if it is to remain, should be to promote the development of younger players for the senior sides. Perhaps for the smaller clubs it helps boost their attendances and helps develop their players and we have to understand that. I think there could be a win-win with some small adjustments.\u201d Win the tournament and a domestic treble will be in reach. However, despite Chelsea\u2019s superiority in head-to-heads with Arsenal this season, Hayes believes their opponents\u2019 record in this tournament means the odds are even. \u201cThis is Arsenal\u2019s trophy,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the one they\u2019ve won the most in recent years. This is the one they\u2019ve dominated, so I expect a fight. I expect an aggressive Arsenal performance. I expect them to go around us, on the outside of the pitch, unlike the last game. I don\u2019t think there is an underdog.\u201d There are many possible match winners in Chelsea\u2019s lineup. Hayes thinks it will be six months before we see the best of Sam Kerr but the Australia striker\u2019s threat is evident. The manager, though, is keen to downplay the individual. \u201c[There are] no superstars here. Just so I\u2019m clear: none, including Sam Kerr. A wonderful individual who will fit into the team, and I\u2019ll say that because it\u2019s the one thing she dislikes the most. She wants to be seen as a team player.\u201d Lining up alongside Kerr will likely be Beth England, whose fight to earn her place at Chelsea after being sent on loan has paid off and is somewhat symbolic of the character the team have shown in coming from behind to win or draw nine league games this season. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have hardships,\u201d Hayes says. \u201cToo often, players think they\u2019re going to come through their journeys and it\u2019s a straight route to the top. She was never ready in her first year here and needed that loan. Has it been easy? We had to have difficult conversations, yes. Has she had to earn my trust? A million per cent, and that\u2019s a real credit to her because rarely do you see that. \u201cYou have to ask yourself the question: \u2018How many teams are going to go to Manchester City like we did at the weekend and fight back like we did [to draw 3-3]?\u2019 That resilience, that ability to come from behind, that belief that no matter the scoreline, we\u2019re going to win the game \u2026 You have to have hardship to fuel that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
