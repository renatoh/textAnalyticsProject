The currently untitled book will be released in May 2020 and will be set in the world of Panem 64 years before the events of the dystopian franchise. It will focus on the time after the so-called \u201cDark Days,\u201d, a failed rebellion. \u201cWith this book, I wanted to explore the state of nature, who we are, and what we perceive is required for our survival,\u201d Collins said in a statement. \u201cThe reconstruction period 10 years after the war, commonly referred to as the Dark Days \u2013 as the country of Panem struggles back to its feet \u2013 provides fertile ground for characters to grapple with these questions and thereby define their views of humanity.\u201d The Hunger Games books, which focus on a world where teenagers must fight to the death as a form of entertainment, were adapted into a globally successful big-screen franchise starring Jennifer Lawrence as heroine Katniss Everdeen. The four films have made almost $3bn at the box office and Lionsgate has expressed interest in extending the franchise as well. \u201cAs the proud home of the Hunger Games movies, we can hardly wait for Suzanne\u2019s next book to be published,\u201d said Joe Drake, Lionsgate chairman. \u201cWe\u2019ve been communicating with her during the writing process and we look forward to continuing to work closely with her on the movie.\u201d In 2017, a Hunger Games theme park opened in Dubai, with attractions including a Capitol bullet train rollercoaster, the hall of heroes, and the Panem aerial tour multimedia experience. This summer, a Lionsgate theme park is set to open in China that will feature a 3D motion simulator attraction pegged to the final film. The original books were all New York Times bestsellers upon release, selling more than 65m copies in the US alone and translated into 51 languages for 56 territories. Since then, Collins has released an autobiographical picture book called Year of the Jungle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
