They finished 10th four years ago under Alan Pardew and after victory at Burnley are part of a chasing pack on the tails of fifth-placed Tottenham. The win stopped a worrying rot of five games without victory and, with Wilfried Zaha having come to the fore in recent outings, there is plenty for a painfully inconsistent Palace to build on. December looks kind, too, with Bournemouth the visitors to Selhurst Park on Tuesday before matches against Watford, Brighton, Newcastle, West Ham and Southampton. After a quiet start Zaha, who has scored in successive games, is beginning to take centre stage, which is right where Palace need him. \u201cHe has been very good in recent games,\u201d Roy Hodgson said. \u201cWe are grateful for the three points but now we need to use this feeling going forwards.\u201d Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Burnley 0-2 Crystal Palace 2) Chelsea miss Abraham\u2019s mobility Expect Tammy Abraham to walk straight back into the Chelsea team if he has recovered from a hip injury in time to face Aston Villa on Wednesday. They were clueless in attack during the home defeat by West Ham and badly missed Abraham\u2019s mobility up front. Olivier Giroud started for the first time since August and a laboured performance from the striker could persuade Frank Lampard to sell him next month. However, Chelsea\u2019s squad is not deep. Lampard made five changes after the draining draw with Valencia but it was a muddled display. Pedro, another who could be allowed to leave, struggled after being handed a rare start and it was surprising Michy Batshuayi stayed on the bench when Chelsea, who finished with the diminutive Christian Pulisic playing through the middle, were chasing an equaliser. Lampard needs Abraham back. Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Chelsea 0-1 West Ham 3) Everton have the players but not the finish Whatever the future of Marco Silva, Everton are not a team bereft of talent. Djibril Sidib\u00e9, playing as a wing-back, supplied the excellent cross from which Richarlison scored a diving header of which Andy Gray and Graeme Sharp, the strike partnership of the club\u2019s 1980s golden era, would have been proud. And the Brazilian goalscorer maintained his threat right up to the point Leicester stole the game with Kelechi Iheanacho\u2019s late winner. Moise Kean\u2019s brief cameo started with an improvised chip that had Kasper Schmeichel beaten and scrabbling. Alex Iwobi played a second-half crossfield pass of wonderful vision amid other flashes of creativity. James Maddison, Youri Tielemans and Harvey Barnes were kept unusually quiet by the midfield endeavour of Tom Davies and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Defeat, though, came when concentration dropped. John Brewin \u2022 Match report: Leicester 2-1 Everton 4) Liverpool the set-piece kings Graham Potter\u2019s analysis of defeat at Anfield nailed the simple truth that Liverpool are impossible to stop. Brighton matched the Premier League leaders in open play but were powerless to prevent them making it 40 set-piece goals since the start of last season \u2013 nine more than Bournemouth in second. \u201cYou can be good in 90% of the pitch but if you are not good in that part they can do all sorts of things to hurt you,\u201d the Brighton manager said. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably got the best deliverer of the ball and the best attacker of the ball in the world.\u201d He was referring to Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk. J\u00fcrgen Klopp said: \u201cI am not so silly that I say I only want to see a game where I only see \u2018blitz\u2019 football. A lot of teams sit back, especially in the last one and a half years, so we have to play around that wall. There are different ways to finish a game off.\u201d Andy Hunter \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 2-1 Brighton 5) Grealish takes the hits from United\u2019s bruisers Old Trafford was treated to a familiar sight in the opening 10 minutes, as a spindly, cocksure attacking midfielder was kicked from pillar to post by brutish opponents before responding with a wondrous goal. Jack Grealish is no Cristiano Ronaldo but it says a fair bit about Manchester United\u2019s last decade that they are now playing the role of hapless bruisers. As for the Aston Villa man, the fact he is the Premier League\u2019s most fouled player \u2013 and by an astonishing distance \u2013 is a reflection of defenders\u2019 inability to deal with him legally. The 24-year-old would be wise, though, to think twice when the heavyweights inevitably come calling. The opponents he played against on Sunday, who included Juan Mata, Fred and Luke Shaw, offer all the evidence he needs about the power of a big move to derail a decent career. Alex Hess \u2022 Match report: Manchester United 2-2 Aston Villa 6) Shelvey too sharp for Manchester City Before kick-off a plane flew over St James\u2019 Park trailing a banner urging everyone to Vote Brexit Party and, perhaps warming to the election theme, Pep Guardiola\u2019s post-match message was similarly unconvincing. \u201cWe played so good,\u201d said City\u2019s manager, applying the sort of spin capable of making even a politician blush. In reality his side were always vulnerable to Newcastle\u2019s counterattacking pace and had no excuses when the former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey quite possibly handed his old club the title after being left unmarked as Christian Atsu shaped to take a late free-kick before pulling the ball back for Shelvey to equalise. \u201cI\u2019d love to say it was due to wonderful training-ground coaching,\u201d Steve Bruce said, \u201cbut Jonjo saw City had nobody on the edge of the box, which is very rare for teams these days, and had a word with Christian.\u201d Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle 2-2 Manchester City 7) VAR becomes the fans\u2019 opera Talking about VAR: fine. A bit tedious but sadly unavoidable. Arguing about VAR: regrettable but perhaps an inevitable corollary of a botched law and an increasingly heated public discourse. In these divided times can we at least agree that singing about VAR should be beyond the pale? Norwich and Arsenal fans were the latest ones at it on Sunday. After the technology first awarded Arsenal a penalty, and then awarded Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang a second go at it because of Norwich encroachment, the indignant Norwich fans struck up an indignant chant of \u201cFuck VAR\u201d \u2013 the protest anthem Joan Baez never wrote. Not to be outdone, the Arsenal fans started merrily singing their praise of the new technology. This is football in 2019: rival fans engaging in VAR-themed call-and-response opera, like a doomsday Gilbert and Sullivan. Jonathan Liew \u2022 Match report: Norwich 2-2 Arsenal 8) Saints must not get carried away Victory over Watford has eased the pressure on Southampton before Norwich visit St Mary\u2019s on Wednesday but it would be foolish for Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side to get carried away. Hasenh\u00fcttl said Saturday was not the time to berate his players\u2019 worrying first-half performance but if his side can replicate the kind of urgency they displayed in the later stages of their first home win since April then they will give themselves a fighting chance. Norwich will take plenty of heart from an enthralling draw against Arsenal on Sunday and Saints could do worse than take inspiration from the way Daniel Farke\u2019s side attacked on home soil. Too often Southampton shrivelled into their shell before Sofiane Boufal and Shane Long injected life into a desperate display. Against a playful and fearless Norwich they cannot afford to make the same mistake. Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Southampton 2-1 Watford 9) Sissoko fits the bill for Mourinho It has been suggested Moussa Sissoko is Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s type of player. He has the physicality and athleticism the manager values and is capable of making an effective defensive contribution from the right-hand side of midfield. That may be true but Sissoko would surely not be in Mourinho\u2019s team if he did not think he could trust him. He led the Tottenham team in interceptions (and fouls) against Bournemouth and buzzed around constantly in support of the right-back Serge Aurier. Sissoko was reliable and read the game well. It is surely this improved aspect of the 30-year old\u2019s performance that will have endeared him most to Mourinho. Sissoko\u2019s sweetly taken goal was a sign of a man playing with confidence and \u2013 for someone whose strife in front of goal has become legendary \u2013 a pleasure to watch. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: Tottenham 3-2 Bournemouth 10) Mousset the bargain buy who keeps giving If Chris Wilder\u2019s Sheffield United are largely a triumph of coaching (four of Sunday\u2019s back five played on their last trip to Molineux in the Championship) then the rampant form of Lys Mousset is proof the manager is no fool in the transfer market either. After three deeply unremarkable seasons at Bournemouth, Mousset was not many people\u2019s idea of a sparkling goalscorer but Wilder saw something in him and, having parted with the relative pittance of \u00a310m, can feel fully vindicated. The forward has already found the net more times in 13 games for his new club than he did in 71 at Bournemouth. Pound for pound, Mousset is the signing of the season so far \u2013 although it says plenty about the grotesque wealth of the Premier League that its bargain-basement castoffs are now selling for eight-figure sums.
