Actually the animals are fairly ordinary \u2013 nothing you couldn't see in a zoo \u2013 but their bodies are built along lines that may have practical applications for us humans. As Hammond put it: \"A lot of the problems we're trying to solve have already been solved ...\" \u2013 brief, Clarksonesque pause \u2013 \"... by evolution.\" For example, the body of a Cape vulture \u2013 too big for its wingspan, in theory \u2013 gives them the ability to manoeuvre inside and between thermals, allowing them to travel up to 100 miles a flight. Hammond demonstrates by strapping himself to a paraglider and stepping off a South African cliff. Hammond puts himself in harm's way a lot, and part of the fun stems from what appears to be genuine reluctance. If you dislike Hammond (personally, I find him the least offensive of the Top Gear triumvirate), this can work on another level for you. The vulture design has been incorporated into a new submarine \u2013 upside-down, because you're trying to keep the craft under the surface rather than up in the air. Hammond has a go in the sub, too. You probably understand how the programme works by now. It was perfectly entertaining \u2013 fascinating, in places \u2013 but not scientifically taxing, a combination to which I find myself increasingly susceptible. And it made its point without dwelling on the obvious fact that a lot of what we know about how animals are built comes from killing them and pulling them apart. I liked the mechanical giraffe rigged up by a waterhole to demonstrate what should happen every time a giraffe bends down to take a drink. Its head should explode off like a cork. It doesn't, because a giraffe's arteries constrict automatically to stop all the blood rushing down its neck. This mechanism is replicated in a new flightsuit \u2013 enabling a test pilot to experience a force of 9g without blacking out. In fact he was able to complete a Rubik's Cube while whizzing round in a centrifuge. Hammond then travelled to the Black Rock Desert to test a protective capsule designed like a woodpecker's head \u2013 it looked nothing like a woodpecker's head, by the way \u2013 which withstands 1,200g with every peck, without scrambling the bird's brain. Into the capsule, Hammond placed a lightbulb. \"I wouldn't expect this to survive a fall from a kitchen worktop,\" he said. \"We're going to drop it ...\" \u2013 trademark pause \u2013 \"... from space.\" It took them so long to find where the capsule smashed into the desert that they had to post it to Hammond later \u2013 weirdly, swaddled in bubblewrap. The lightbulb still worked. All that, and a mobile phone that can survive being dropped into a toilet. What's not to like? I watched most of Nigel Slater: Life is Sweets (BBC4) with a lump the size of a humbug in my throat. The cookery writer set off to investigate \"why something as simple as a sweet can help us time-travel so evocatively\". Nigella Lawson, who was briefly drafted in to support his theory, alleged that for Britons the boiled sweet was the equivalent of Proust's madeleine. Then she apologised for being so pretentious. I didn't think this was going to be my sort of thing at all. I'm not British, so I don't get very excited by the thought of buying Pontefract cakes by weight. The idea of a \"proper sweet shop\" with glass jars and scales stirs up wells of peevish impatience in me. But Slater visited one in the company of a charming sweet expert, Tim Richardson, who revealed their pharmaceutical roots (they were actual roots, in many cases, coated in sugar to preserve them), and vouchsafed the fact that in Victorian times jelly babies were known as unclaimed babies. This information did not deter Slater from resuming his childhood habit of biting their heads off. \"There aren't many areas of life where you can legitimately bite the head off a baby,\" said Richardson. Slater's relationship with his past has always seemed raw, and it was his investigation of his own childhood that produced the humbug-sized lump. After his mother died when he was nine, he told a psychologist, his father took to leaving marshmallows on the boy's bedside table every night. They were, said Slater, the closest to a goodnight kiss his father could manage. \"And that was enough?\" said the psychologist. \"No,\" said Slater."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
