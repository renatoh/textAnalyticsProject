But it seems Ed is on nodding terms with great wealth himself. According to the latest register of MPs' interests, Labour Ed received a \"Harrods Christmas hamper valued at over \u00a3660\" from the Sultan of Brunei. The Sultan, once the world's richest man, thanks to running the oil-rich nation, has slipped a little in the league tables of the super wealthy. But he is still the world's richest royal, with a fleet of thousands of Ferraris, Rolls-Royces and Mercedes. The people of Brunei get something from the oil wealth, with subsidised housing, education and health. But they don't get democracy: the Sultan has absolute power. Of a kind one cements by sending out lavish hampers. \u2022 Happy days indeed for Harry Redknapp, freed from the prospect of a chilly cell to the promise of the England manager's job, and all within 24 hours. A jury of his peers made this possible by dismissing any suggestion that he didn't pay his tax. But then so many people provided support through this, his most difficult time. \"The Wigan game was the most moving I have ever felt \u2026 with fans singing my name throughout the game. I'll never forget that,\" said the man of the moment. Fans who were actually there heard them sing more than his name. \"He pays what he wants, he pays what he wants, Harry Redknapp, he pays what he wants,\" was the chant from one section. Turned out not to be the case in terms of his taxation arrangement, and he walks away without a stain. But in terms of football, what he wants is probably what he will get. \u2022 And with more ugly stuff emerging from the Leveson inquiry, the stock of journalism sinks low. But it has never hit rock bottom. Thank God for the bankers. Nobody wants to be associated with them. Once, before the PM's \"big society\" idea was laughed into irrelevance, there was the allied concept of a big society bank. Alas, no longer. \"What progress has been made on the implementation of the big society bank?\" asked Tory MP Michael Ellis of Cabinet Office minister Nick Hurd. \"We are making excellent progress in establishing big society capital group (formerly referred to as the big society bank),\" was the minister's written reply. Magic. One minute the \"bank\" was there; gone the next. \u2022 More news about Brian Coleman, the head of London's fire authority, whose taxi expenses are discussed with a tone usually reserved for bankers' bonuses. He spent \u00a33,500 on cabs in 2010, which constituted belt-tightening. The figure was \u00a38,000 in 2008. And one can see why he does it, for more recently, when the ebullient Conservative drove himself to a function, pesky union members took photos of what does seem to be him, behind the wheel, apparently using his mobile. They have sent the snaps away for closer scrutiny by the Metropolitan police. \u2022 Week one for Ed Davey as energy secretary, meanwhile, following the unfortunate redeployment to the law courts of Chris Huhne. And while it wouldn't be fair to say the department \u2013 or indeed the government \u2013 has run out of ideas, it does seem as if mandarins are looking for inspiration. On Tuesday, when Labour's climate change and energy person Caroline Flint gave a speech on the green economy, the guest list showed no fewer than 18 government civil servants in attendance; five from the Department of Energy and Climate Change, four from Defra, two from the business department, two from Dfid, two more from the Foreign Office, two from the environment agency and one lone wolf from the Treasury. Seems strange in the age of austerity. \"Couldn't they just send one and ask them to take notes,\" asked one observer. Anyone would think they just wanted an agreeable day away from the office. \u2022 Finally, what a night there was in prospect. An event involving Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, who has, thus far, steered the government's health reforms so masterfully. The venue, The Old Brewery in central London. Lansley played no part in its organisation. twitter/@hugh_muir \u2022 This article was amended on 10 February. The original standfirst said a \u00a36,000 hamper from the Sultan of Brunei. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
