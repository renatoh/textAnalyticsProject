It's a real classic that always tastes special, yet is really easy to make. I love it with Basmati rice, but it's also good with brown rice, noodles or creamy mashed potatoes. Ordinary closed-cap white mushrooms are fine, or chestnut mushrooms - just make sure they're firm and tightly closed. The parsley adds a touch of colour; alternatively, sprinkle the finished dish with scarlet paprika instead. I like to serve this with a nice green salad. These quantities serve two. 25g butter or vegan margarine 1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 500g mushrooms, sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 4 tbsp vegetarian sherry or white wine 200ml double or soya cream (Soya Dream, from health-food shops) 1 tbsp lemon juice Salt, pepper and grated nutmeg 1-2 tbsp parsley, chopped To serve Hot cooked rice In a large pan, melt the butter with the olive oil. Add the onion, cover and cook gently until soft - about seven minutes. Add the mushrooms and garlic, and cook for five minutes, until they are buttery and getting soft. Pour in the sherry or wine and cream and let it bubble away for 10 minutes, until the liquid has reduced and thickened to a sauce. Stir in the lemon juice and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Serve on the rice, and top with chopped parsley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
