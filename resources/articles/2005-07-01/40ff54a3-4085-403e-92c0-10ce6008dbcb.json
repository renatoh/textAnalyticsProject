But what about with Chinese people? That'll be food or health. \"Have you eaten?\" \"Ni chi le ma?\" is the most important, most popular sentence in the Chinese language, used wherever and whenever, even if you just meet someone in the street at midnight. It is not necessary to answer precisely when you ate or what you had, a simple \"yes, I have\" or \"chi le\" is enough. That means you are not hungry, your life isn't bad; it also means you have nothing much to talk about or you are in hurry. If you answer \"not yet\" \"mei ne\" or \"what about you?\" \"ni ne?\", that means you want to keep that person's attention. Or if you want to tell them something but not necessarily about food, then you could go on \"why not?\" \"wei shen ma?\" When you hear a Chinese person say, \"You look so tired, are you OK?\", please don't be upset. It's not that you really look terrible. It is just our way of showing you how much we care about you. It's a way of saying we respect and admire you - you are a great person who is still working or meeting friends even though you are so tired and look terrible. I am sure it is very difficult for westerners to accept, especially if you are tired and really feel terrible but don't want anyone to notice. It can all be very embarrassing. Toby, my husband, had an accident in Argentina four years ago when he fell from a horse. He broke his left arm, shoulder bone and one rib. Before going to pick him up from the airport, I told the Chinese student who was staying with us: \"Please try to be polite and patient with this English man who must be in great pain and needs help.\" But I forgot to warn him of the culture difference. The student was such a kind boy and probably thought a lot about what to say. \"Oh, my God! Toby, you look unbelievably miserable!\" the boy shouted out as soon as we walked into the flat. Toby's face dropped. Before I had a chance to stop him, he continued his polite chat: \"Poor Toby, your eyes are both so bruised, like a Chinese panda!\" Toby's eyes started burning. I went behind Toby and started waving my arms - stop, stop! He misunderstood and carried on: \"Yes, I can see your body is swollen like a big bear!\" Then to help his basic English, he used body language - he started walking like a bear. I can't tell you how embarrassed Toby was. I felt it too, because I had learned a little bit about the difference in British and Chinese cultures. In the following months, during Toby's recovery, I had many calls and emails - my Chinese friends really got a chance to tell us how much they cared. One western friend asked me: \"Why are your Chinese friends so 'excited' by other people's health problems?\" Westerners don't understand why food and health have become such a popular topic in Chinese daily life. This comes down to more than 5,000 years of Chinese history. As far as I understand, you need to go back to historical records from about 1300 BC, when Chinese rulers started to tell people what you could or couldn't say or do. Beliefs and religion? No, you needed only believe in the ruler. Personal opinions about the society you live in? No, you were just a small cog with no need to think. Sexuality? No, that was too private to be talked about. Law? Nothing to discuss, the ruler's words were law! And so food and medicine occupied a big part of Chinese culture. Most Chinese people won't bring flowers and wine to you when they visit your home in China, but they will carry lots of tonic for your overall health. But, I have to say, I still can't work out why the British, who have been living in a much further advanced civilisation, still choose the weather as a safe way to start their conversation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
