It was early March and snow was still spattered on the leaf mould between the firs and larches. Hip-hop and classic rock radio stations were gradually replaced by grave pastors and bawdy men twanging banjos and, eventually, they too faded to crackling white noise. The signal pips on my phone hollowed out. I was nearly there. Over a crest in the road was the cause of the electronic silence: the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), an array of radio telescopes set against the indigo vastness of the Blue Ridge Mountains. These giant white ears are cocked to interstellar whispers: the formation of stars, nebulae and supernovae. So sensitive are the devices, and what they are listening for so faint, that even tiny signals nearby can be disruptive: a badly fitted microwave or a faulty electric blanket. It\u2019s like trying to eavesdrop across a room while listening to heavy metal in your earphones. In the same zone is another telescope, run by the National Security Agency (NSA), and there is a chance some of your Facebook messages may have passed this way. But if that scheme caused international outrage, then the Green Bank telescope has been more controversial locally. Thanks to the unusual lack of interference, the town has become a haven for those looking to escape electromagnetic radiation and over the past decade, as many as 40 people have moved here. It might not sound much, but Green Bank\u2019s population was only 120 or so to begin with. Imagine two million people moving to London and demanding the city be ghost-proofed, and you get an idea of the scale of the disruption. There have been reports of tensions in the town: tales of threats and abuse unfitting to a sleepy mountain village. And it is all the stranger when you consider that no serious scientific study has been able to establish that electrosensitivity exists. According to the World Health Organisation, \u201cEHS [electromagnetic hypersensitivity] has no clear diagnostic criteria and there is no scientific basis to link EHS symptoms to EMF [electromotive force] exposure. Further, EHS is not a medical diagnosis, nor is it clear that it represents a single medical problem.\u201d When I arrived there was not much sign of anything, let alone simmering social unrest. Past five o\u2019clock everything was shut for the night. The air was freezing. For $30 I got a room in a motel where I was the only guest. \u201cLeave the key on the bed when you go,\u201d said its owner, before driving off herself, leaving her business in the care of at least six cats. The next day I headed for the main drag, which was not hard to find in a town with one road. Green Bank is not a metropolis. Along with the telescope, there is a school, church, library and craft shop, as well as Henry\u2019s: a petrol station that quintuples up as a supermarket, public toilet, restaurant and general hub, and where I went in search of breakfast. \u201cYou\u2019re not from round here, are you?\u201d said Mary, my waitress. The staff were engaged in trying to balance a green plastic St Patrick\u2019s Day hat on a stuffed moose head. Other diners arrived, heavy-set men in fleece and camouflage. Everyone knew everyone by name and I was the only person without a pickup truck. I confirmed Mary\u2019s suspicions, and asked her about the migration. \u201cPeople come here because they say they can hear the electrics,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a real condition or not. But the electro- sensitives swear it is, so\u2026 to each their own, I say.\u201d She didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cI don\u2019t really mind not having a cellphone,\u201d she added. \u201cYou get used to that. And a lot of us have Wi-Fi in our homes anyway, so that\u2019s OK.\u201d Hang on, so in The Town Without Wi-Fi, there is in fact quite a lot of Wi-Fi? I worried that this would not make for as catchy a headline as I had hoped. \u201cNot publicly, but at home some of us do. It\u2019s not illegal, but the observatory has a truck that can sense it. They\u2019ll come round and ask you to turn it off.\u201d At the library I met Arnie Stewart, a longtime resident and retiree. He had an easy manner, and the air of someone who had been asked these questions before. He pitched himself as a conciliatory figure, a diplomat between two warring tribes. \u201cThe serious migration has been going on for about six years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends on the person, but almost all of them are affected by cellphone towers. They\u2019ll be driving along and have to pull over because they have blurred vision, confusion, or their skin will break out in rashes. I think it\u2019s something that everyone is sensitive to, in some degree: I sit in front of a computer for a couple of hours and my face starts to feel warm.\u201d Stewart said he was sceptical about electrosensivity until he tried an experiment. He held a meeting with some electrosensitives, and didn\u2019t tell them he had a mobile phone in his pocket. \u201cThey noticed at once. After that I was convinced. If you\u2019re sick, who am I to shun you? And mostly the electrosensitives have realised that they have to fit in, and it\u2019s been fine,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut one person created some tensions.\u201d That person was Diane Schou, one of the first electrosensitives to migrate to Green Bank, and their unofficial local leader. She moved in 2007, after her life was made unbearable by a new cellphone mast at the research farm in Cedar Falls, Iowa, that she shared with her husband, Bert, and their son. She began suffering terrible headaches, along with blurred vision and skin rashes. At first she didn\u2019t know why. \u201cI got the symptoms of radiation sickness,\u201d she told me. Her tone was patient, like a veteran teacher explaining old truths to young students. \u201cI went to the doctor and he wasn\u2019t able to diagnose it. Eventually I established that I was reacting to a buried cellphone tower. US Cellular was the brand \u2013 I didn\u2019t react to AT&amp;T, Spring or Cellular One towers.\u201d She reeled off the names as if it would be the most normal thing in the world to have a brand-specific allergy. With her home life increasingly unbearable, she began to travel across the USA and even further afield, to Scandinavia and Nicaragua, in search of somewhere more peaceful. Sweden is one of the few places to recognise electrosensitivity as a disability and the government will help sufferers insulate their homes. \u201cIn Scandinavia there were places where electrosensitives gathered, but they didn\u2019t go far enough to prevent the signals,\u201d Schou said. \u201cFarmers still used electric fences for their sheep, or people would use cordless phones.\u201d At last she settled on Green Bank, the \u201cbest of the worst,\u201d even though some residents still have local Wi-Fi, and power lines run above ground. \u201cAt least they speak English here,\u201d she said. Bert stayed behind in Cedar Falls. \u201cHe would move if I asked him, but he gets bored here.\u201d Surely such a move has been difficult for their marriage, I asked? \u201cIt has been a challenge, for sure. We used to have three meals a day together, and now we only see each other every few months.\u201d In an effort to make Green Bank more navigable, Schou made some requests of local businesses. A Dollar Store was opening, but its fluorescent and halogen lights would be intolerable. She asked that they were changed. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t do it. And without the light it gets very dark in there, so they\u2019re not willing to turn off the power.\u201d She took to eating her meals in the senior citizens\u2019 centre, where a gap in the lighting gave her some peace. But walking to collect her food entailed exposure to problem bulbs, so she would ask others to wait on her. Things came to a head. A town meeting was called. \u201cShe became very demanding, asking other people to turn their lights off or replace their bulbs,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cIt was too much. And Schou was encouraging other sensitives to move here, and this is not a town with many jobs or houses to begin with.\u201d Where the locals might have been happy to tolerate one or two of the sensitives, the mass migration was beyond the pale. Another sensitive who moved to Green Bank was reported to have flown into a rage at the library, denouncing the \u201cdumb hillbillies\u201d. \u201cPeople tell me to stop encouraging others to move here, and to stop bringing them into stores,\u201d Schou confirms. \u201cThe hostility continues.\u201d People would walk towards Schou with concealed electronics, in an effort to provoke a reaction. A meeting she and her husband organised to help educate the others about electrosensivity descended into a slanging match. Schou, who has called herself a \u201ctechnological leper,\u201d said the ill will went further: \u201cI had a visitor staying, a fellow refugee, and the air was let out of our car tyres overnight.\u201d She felt the hostility was best explained as a kind of conspiracy between the ill-informed and Big Telephony. \u201cI believe that there are some people here who used to work for the telephone industry, and are trying to support the industry by getting rid of me.\u201d Schou seemed to accept that her role as a pioneer will ruffle a few feathers. Charlie Meckna, by comparison, was more reserved. Friendly but quietly spoken, he wore blue jeans and white trainers, in that style unique to middle-aged American men. His view is that \u201cattention-seeking\u201d behaviour by \u201ccertain individuals\u201d is a distraction from the real issues. This is an argument I heard several times from those with EHS, that their particular condition was real, while others\u2019 were purely psychosomatic. Meckna moved to Green Bank last July, after years trying to work out what was making him sick. In particular he found that he was sensitive to cordless phones and public Wi-Fi. \u201cI would feel dizzy and nauseous, and get a bad ringing in my ear. People would find me passed out. It\u2019s not perfect in Green Bank at all, but otherwise it was going to kill me. There are a lot of ignorant people who don\u2019t understand. You\u2019d have thought the population would be more sympathetic, given that 70% of them have diabetes and more than 20 people have cancer. I always say: \u2018Do you think I want this?\u2019 No.\u201d None of which gets round the core issue: if EHS is real, I asked Diane, then why has it not shown up in formal experiments? \u201cI encourage scientists to go to where we are and measure the environment,\u201d she replied. \u201cDon\u2019t try to pretend that you\u2019re God and expose us to different frequencies in a lab. That\u2019s like taking someone and breaking their legs and asking how much it hurts.\u201d For Sarah Dacre, the head of the 1,000-strong Electrosensitivity UK, the lack of proof from major studies is merely evidence of a conspiracy between interested parties. \u201cConventional government-funded science isn\u2019t a reliable indicator of health defects,\u201d she told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a vested interest in keeping the truth out of circulation. But the independent science isn\u2019t sceptical about it at all.\u201d Her society was on the verge of exerting great influence on public policy, she added, although progress had been hindered by infiltrators, who were leaking information back to the government and phone companies. \u201cLike spies?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, they don\u2019t call themselves spies.\u201d No, I said, I supposed they didn\u2019t. Like Meckna, Dacre felt that there were people claiming to be electrosensitive who were nothing of the sort, who were queering the pitch for the others: \u201cYou can tell at once who is just pretending,\u201d she said. After I spoke to her, my inbox was deluged by fellow sufferers who had been alerted to this article, linking to the independent studies that support their claims. Perhaps surprisingly, Green Bank was a hard place to leave. After the initial difficulty of organising interviews without a mobile or the internet, I had quickly settled into a slower pace. In my motel I read until I fell asleep. I woke at dawn to the pale light sharking through the windows. It was easy to see how this place could provide solace, even to the non-electrosensitive. Part of the problem, I suspect, is that few of us doubt the behavioural or environmental threats of technology; our endless distractibility, the constant beeps and whirrs and notifications of modern life. You might argue that electrosensitivity is simply an extreme reaction to a whole range of bewildering stimuli. Dacre told me that many come to her after a bereavement or other illness, even a bad insect bite \u2013 something that knocks the world off-balance. It is well documented that psychosomatic conditions can provoke real symptoms, and nobody would wish to mock the afflicted. Or at least, not much. As I prepared to make tracks, Charlie Meckna pointed up at some slivers of grey cloud that hung in the vast powder-blue sky. \u201cSee those?\u201d he asked. \u201cAeroplane trails?\u201d \u201cNot contrails \u2013 chemtrails,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government sprays the air \u2013 it gets in the atmosphere.\u201d He paused and looked me in the eye. \u201cThe world needs to know what\u2019s happening here.\u201d I drove off, slightly too quickly, eager to refresh my feeds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
