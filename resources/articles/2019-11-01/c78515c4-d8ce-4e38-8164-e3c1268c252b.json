Tens of thousands of supporters wearing their team\u2019s black-and-red jerseys poured into the streets of the city\u2019s historic centre in the morning to welcome Flamengo players. For hours the flood of supporters, including many families and children, celebrated peacefully, waving flags and setting off fireworks as the Copa Libertadores winners rode through the streets in an open-top bus. But around 4.30pm, in the final stretch of the festivities, TV images showed thick white smoke coming out of the parade, which quickly dispersed the nearby crowd. Clashes followed, with a group of supporters throwing rocks, beer bottles and other objects at police. The disturbances later eased. The team\u2019s 2-1 victory over the Argentinian side River Plate has lifted the spirits of Brazilians after a period of economic stagnation and political infighting. That is especially true in Rio, home of the country\u2019s largest club. They had not won the Copa in 38 years while Brazilian rivals had won five of the previous 10 competitions. Flamengo then completed a rare double on Sunday when they secured the Brazilian league title after their closest challengers, Palmeiras, lost 2-1 at home to Gr\u00eamio. The result leaves Flamengo an unassailable 13 points ahead of Palmeiras with four games of the Serie A season remaining. It is the seventh league title for Flamengo and completes a historic weekend. It is the first time that a Brazilian team has won both the league and the Libertadores in the same year since Pel\u00e9\u2019s Santos in 1963."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
