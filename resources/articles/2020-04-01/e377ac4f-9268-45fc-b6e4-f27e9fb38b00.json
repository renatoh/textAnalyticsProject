Normally, some would be making their racecourse debuts for their new owners in a matter of weeks. Amid the paralysis and uncertainty of the coronavirus lockdown, though, there will be no Breeze-Up sales in their natural slot at the outset of a fresh campaign, and perhaps 1,000 two-year-olds that have been carefully prepared for a move to a racing stable could end up as a lost generation. For anyone who has already invested significant amounts of expertise, capital and time steering these horses to the brink of a racecourse career, it is a potentially disastrous possibility. Many of the hundreds of juveniles that are sold at Breeze-Up sales in April and May each year, at Newmarket, Doncaster, Ascot and Deauville, are \u201cpinhooks\u201d, bought as foals or yearlings and then carefully prepared to be sold as race-ready juveniles in the spring of their two-year-old season. When a pinhooker gets it right, the profit on their initial investment can be eye-watering. Tally-Ho Stud in Ireland, for instance, bought a daughter of Kingman for 92,000gns (\u00a396,600) at Tattersalls\u2019 December yearling sale in 2018 and then sold her to Godolphin on the same spot just four months later \u2013 for 850,000gns (\u00a3892,500). But second-guessing the bloodstock market can be an expensive business too, and if a horse is unsold, much or all of their investment can be lost. What no one would ever expect, though, is for there to be no market at all. \u201cThere\u2019s about 1,000 horses out there waiting to be sold, and I\u2019d think about 85% of them are here in Ireland,\u201d Willie Browne, whose Mocklershill Stud operation has been pinhooking for more than 40 years, said this week. \u201cSo everybody\u2019s a bit down, but we\u2019re living on the hope that we can maybe get them sold. I\u2019ve got 75 horses here and it\u2019s a huge drain on finances. \u201cIt\u2019s scary, because nobody has a crystal ball, we don\u2019t know when the sales will be. The thing about our business is, you can maybe do racing in lockdown but we need people on the ground, unless you\u2019re going to online bidding, which would be very new in Europe. Somebody has to see these horses in the flesh.\u201d Australia\u2019s prestigious Easter Yearling Sale took place online earlier this month, but at present, the 2020 Breeze-Up sales have simply been postponed. The Craven Breeze-Up is now scheduled for 27 to 29 May, with around 150 lots catalogued, while the Doncaster sale has switched to the eve of Royal Ascot in mid-June, should the meeting take place. \u201cA partial resumption of racing in Britain and hopefully Ireland and France as well is the key,\u201d Jimmy George, Tattersalls\u2019 chief executive, says. \u201cSales without racing are a very difficult prospect and it\u2019s hard to envisage a realistic market while racing throughout Europe is suspended. It\u2019s unsettling, and I don\u2019t think we should underestimate the impact this will have on the overall market, and on the consignors who have a lot of capital tied up in these Breeze-Up two-year-olds.\u201d If an online auction is the only option, the sellers will have little choice but to take it, despite their misgivings. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it would work as I\u2019ve never bought a horse online,\u201d Roger O\u2019Callaghan, of Tally-Ho Stud, said this week. \u201cBut I know that sometimes when you see a horse walking around the ring, even though you might go in to give X, you go in and give X plus 50. You need to get a feel for it.\u201d For the 2020 crop of race-ready juveniles, time is running out. \u201cThe two-year-old market is unique, in that some of those horses are precocious types and their shelf life mightn\u2019t be that long,\u201d Browne says. \u201cThose types, you\u2019d have to be worried about. If you go into July and still haven\u2019t sold, the yearlings for the next year will start selling in August. So we need to be selling in June at the very latest. \u201cI\u2019m at it since 1977, and I\u2019ve never come across anything like this. But listen, not getting the damn thing is most important when you\u2019re as old as I am.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
