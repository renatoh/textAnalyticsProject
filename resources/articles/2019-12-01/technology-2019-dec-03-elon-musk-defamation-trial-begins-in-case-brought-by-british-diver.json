Twelve boys and their football coach were lost in a subterranean maze in the Tham Luong caves in Thailand. An international team of cave divers raced to rescue them before monsoon rains were due to flood the caves. The story was destined to be fodder for a Hollywood blockbuster \u2013 and that was before an eccentric billionaire got involved. On Tuesday, a postscript to the feelgood tale of the Tham Luang cave rescue played out in a federal courthouse in Los Angeles as the trial began in a defamation case brought by the British caver Vernon Unsworth against Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk. Musk testified on Tuesday that he was being insulting, not literal, when he called Unsworth a pedophile in a tweet after the diver had ridiculed Musk on CNN. Musk said he was upset the diver had belittled his efforts to help by building a miniature submarine to transport the boys. Unsworth\u2019s comments were \u201can unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids\u201d, Musk said. \u201cIt was wrong and insulting, and so I insulted him back.\u201d Unsworth, a British national who lives in Thailand, was among the first divers to reach the scene of the boys\u2019 disappearance. He was credited by rescuers for his detailed knowledge of the cave system, which helped locate the missing team. Musk, the chief of Tesla and SpaceX, had assigned a team of engineers to design a submarine that he hoped could be used to guide the boys through underwater tunnels. Although Musk delivered the submarine to the rescue site, the boys were rescued by divers, one of whom died during the operation. Unsworth drew the ire of Musk following the rescue when he gave a brief interview to CNN and ridiculed his submarine, which he said \u201chad absolutely no chance of working\u201d. He added that Musk should \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d. The billionaire entrepreneur lashed out at Unsworth on Twitter, where he called the caver a \u201cpedo guy\u201d to his 22 million followers. Under intense criticism from the public and his company\u2019s investors, Musk apologised and deleted the tweets, but he subsequently revived the baseless allegations in another series of tweets about a month later. Musk also alleged in another baseless allegation that Unsworth was a \u201cchild rapist\u201d in an email to a BuzzFeed reporter. The jury selection process demonstrated Musk\u2019s fame. Numerous members of the jury pool disclosed business ties to Musk\u2019s various companies, which include Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company, Open AI and Neuralink. Four potential jurors were Tesla owners. One was dismissed when he said he could not be objective about the case because he was about to interview for a job with SpaceX, while two others were let go after saying they followed Musk on Twitter and knew the details of the case. Only one potential juror, an aesthetician, admitted to having strong opinions about billionaires. She was dismissed. Another juror had \u201cnegative and positive\u201d opinions about Musk, and he was allowed to remain. Attorneys for Unsworth and Musk sketched the contours of their cases in opening statements before the eight empaneled jurors. Taylor Wilson, part of Unsworth\u2019s legal team, focused on the number of times that Musk could have, but did not, clarify or retract his remarks about Unsworth. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until a year later that Musk said in a deposition that \u2018pedo guy\u2019 just meant \u2018creepy old guy\u2019,\u201d Wilson said. The result of Musk\u2019s statements was \u201cshame, mortification, worry and distress\u201d, he added, \u201cduring what should have been one of the proudest moments in [Unsworth\u2019s] life\u201d. Musk\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, dismissed Unsworth\u2019s defamation claim, casting the case as \u201cinsults between two men\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s saying he\u2019s been horribly damaged and he deserves lots of money,\u201d Spiro said of Unsworth. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d Spiro described the \u201csleepless nights\u201d Musk\u2019s engineers spent \u201cfrantically trying to help\u201d the boys. He cast Unsworth as the aggressor in the pair\u2019s interactions, noting that the rescue was over and Musk had returned to the US when Unsworth gave his interview to CNN. \u201cWhen he saw this attack it did anger and hurt him,\u201d Spiro said of Musk. \u201cThe real hurtful part was attacking the genuineness of his efforts. That could not go unanswered.\u201d Calling Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy\u201d was not an allegation of pedophilia, but instead a \u201cfill-in-the-blank insult\u201d, the attorney argued. Spiro also introduced an acronym that appears likely to feature heavily in his arguments to come: J-Dart. \u201cIt was a joking, deleted, apologized for, responsive tweet,\u201d he said. \u201cA J-Dart.\u201d Spiro also said Unsworth had not been harmed by Musk\u2019s statements, noting that the cave explorer had since been honored by Queen Elizabeth and Thailand\u2019s King Maha Vajiralongkorn, among others. Later on Tuesday, Musk himself took the witness stand. Musk testified that his Twitter message was sent in response to an \u201cunprovoked\u201d insult he received from Unsworth. \u201cI thought he was just some random creepy guy,\u201d Musk added. \u201cI thought at the time that he was unrelated to the rescue.\u201d Musk said he didn\u2019t know Unsworth had helped with the rescue and that his tweet wasn\u2019t intended as an actual allegation. \u201cJust as I hadn\u2019t literally meant he was a pedophile, he didn\u2019t want to shove a sub up my ass,\u201d Musk said. Tuesday\u2019s trial follows a year of legal wrangling between Unsworth and Musk\u2019s attorneys. Musk had attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing at one point that \u201cpedo guy\u201d is a common insult in his home country of South Africa and was not intended as an actual accusation of pedophilia. Court filings revealed that Musk had also hired a private investigator to attempt to substantiate his allegations against Unsworth. The US district judge Stephen Wilson ruled in November that Unsworth was not a public figure, lowering the bar for the cave explorer to prove that Musk had defamed him.
