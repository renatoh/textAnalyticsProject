In a letter to the prime minister, Mr Huhne said the board should go because \"the same management team that dug the company into the problem is trying to dig it out\". The Newcastle-based mortgage lender was forced to call on emergency funding from the Bank of England in September after the global credit crunch starved it of funds. The bail-out prompted the first run on a UK bank in nearly 150 years, but only chairman Matt Ridley has stepped down. Northern Rock - the UK's fifth-biggest mortgage lender - has borrowed \u00a318bn from the Bank of England since the beginning of the crisis, according to a well-placed source. Mr Huhne said growing concerns over the quality of the lender's loan book meant that the taxpayer \"may find it harder to get the money back\" and called for a full inquiry into the company's finances. The politician's comments come amid reports that savers have withdrawn about \u00a314bn from the ailing bank since the crisis began seven weeks ago. The figure - representing more than half the \u00a324bn deposits held before the crisis began - emerged during due diligence by potential buyers. The UK Shareholders' Association has organised two meetings for shareholders - in Newcastle on November 26 and in London on November 28 - to discuss what action they can take."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
