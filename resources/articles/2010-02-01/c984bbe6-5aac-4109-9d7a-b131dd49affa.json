Yes, Harlequins got their Guinness Premiership campaign back on track, seeing off one of the season's high-fliers, Northampton, 13-6. But they did it all within the space of 20 minutes. If nothing else, that tells you how badly they were smarting after their 40-point defeat by Gloucester last Saturday. It is amazing what a good spanking can do for you. Quins came flying out of the traps and Northampton barely made any impact on the match, not just for those torrid first 20 minutes, but for the whole of the first half. Mike Brown's try at the end of the first quarter supplemented Nick Evans's two early penalties to open up that 13-0 lead for the home side. And Quins could have had at least two more tries before half-time. Northampton edged the play in the second half, helped by a landslide on the penalty count, but Harlequins defended well enough to shut out any threat they created. Saints were pushing for an equalising score at the final knockings, but this victory was far more comfortable than the narrow scoreline might suggest.
