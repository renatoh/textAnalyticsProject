As things stand, Woodland represents the biggest danger to Koepka making history. Victory at Pebble Beach on Sunday would render Koepka only the second player, and first since 1905, to win this major in three consecutive years. Through 54 holes, Koepka \u2013 who makes a point of deriving inspiration from negative forces, real or otherwise \u2013 trails Woodland\u2019s 11 under par by four. The scale of Koepka\u2019s potential triumph should not be overstated; victory in this US Open would represent a fifth in his past nine major starts. \u201cI feel good,\u201d said Koepka after a 68 as moved him to minus seven. \u201cI feel like if I can just make a few putts, I could be right there, right next to Gary. And it\u2019s been very close. I\u2019m pleased at how I\u2019m playing. I\u2019m pleased at how I\u2019m striking the ball. \u201cI feel as confident as ever right now. It\u2019s probably the best ball-striking week I\u2019ve had. Pebble\u2019s greens are so small. I think I only missed one green today, maybe two. To hit as many greens as I have the last two days, the ball-striking is right where I want it.\u201d Woodland must hope his get-out-of-jail cards weren\u2019t used up during day three\u2019s 69. He chipped in to save par at the 12th. Having played the 14th like an 18-handicapper, he holed out from 43ft to prevent a dropped shot. This is uncharted territory for Woodland, whose best major finish is tied sixth, but he will begin the final day with a one-shot cushion. Justin Rose is Woodland\u2019s closest challenger. Koepka, on whom all eyes will inevitably fall upon, has Louis Oosthuizen and Chez Reavie for 54-hole company. Rose\u2019s Saturday 68 was wonderfully tenacious. He has delivered a staggering 34 single putts through three rounds. Unlike Woodland, whom he will again have as a partner on Sunday, Rose has also prevailed in this environment before. Rory McIlroy\u2019s 70 moved him to six under. If that means the Northern Irishman still had a chance of a second US Open title, McIlroy looked bruised by a dropped shot at the 17th. There was little at all wrong with McIlroy\u2019s tee-to-green play on Saturday; putts just wouldn\u2019t drop. \u201cI definitely think I can shoot 65 or 66 on this golf course,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cThat\u2019s probably what it is going to take tomorrow. Everything has got to be on. You\u2019ve got to get off to a fast start, you\u2019ve got to play the par fives well and you need to hit it in the fairways all day. It\u2019s difficult. It is possible, but it is difficult.\u201d Matt Kuchar and Chesson Hadley are a shot adrift of McIlroy. The all-European quintet on four under comprises Danny Willett, Graeme McDowell, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson and Matt Wallace. Tiger Woods appeared for his third round wearing neck tape, demonstrating fitness problems remain a constant for the Masters champion. Woods\u2019s 71 means he is level par on aggregate and, legitimately, aiming for a top-10 finish at best here. \u201cWhen it\u2019s cold like this everything is achy,\u201d Woods explained. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the deal. The forces have to go somewhere. And if they\u2019re not in the lower back, they\u2019re in the neck, and if not, they\u2019re in the mid-back and if not they go to the knee. You name it. \u201cLet me put it this way, I feel every shot I hit. I think that\u2019s always going to be the place from here going forward.\u201d Image of the day was provided by Stenson, who was pictured lying in the rough, next to a fan he had hit with a \u201csemi shank\u201d on the 16th. This was a typical act of decency from Stenson, who explained what happened after signing for his 70. \u201cHe\u2019s in good spirits because he\u2019s taking selfies of himself while he\u2019s down on the ground,\u201d Stenson said. \u201cI walk up to him. I said: \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 What else can you say? And he says: \u2018Can you do me one favour? Can I take a picture with you?\u2019 So next thing I\u2019m down on the ground as well, taking a picture, laying down with him and his girlfriend. \u201cIt feels like he\u2019s had maybe one or two refreshments that might have eased the pain. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s got a concussion but I asked for his details so I can contact him at a later date and check up on him. I might send him a couple of dozen balls or something to try to make up for my poor shot.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
