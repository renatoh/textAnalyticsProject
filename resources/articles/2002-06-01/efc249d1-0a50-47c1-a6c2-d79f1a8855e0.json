For as yet, no team has made the trip to the Shinto Shrine of Shiramine in Kyoto to say prayers or make offerings to the spirit god of ball sports, Seidaimyojin. Technically, Seidaimyojin is the spirit god or kami, as the Japanese say, of kemari , a form of keepy-uppy popular in ancient Japan. But the modern-day Japanese have taken Seidaimyojin to embrace all ball sports and every day hundreds of school children arrive from all over Japan to pray for success on the sports field. Shinto, often translated as 'the way of the gods', is a faith indigenous to Japan. It has been described as integral to what it is to be Japanese, embodying the myths surrounding the origins of Japan, the Imperial family and the creation of the Japanese race. The kami are felt to be manifestations of nature or natural phenomenon, such as mountains, rivers, trees, wind or thunder. They also include ancestral spirits, particularly those connected to the imperial family. The shrine of Shiramine was built to house two such spirits, those of the Emperor's Junnin (718-737) and Sutoku (1119-1164). Emperors were great patrons of kemari and courtiers were often able to rise in rank if they were good at kemari . One emperor and his team are recorded to have been able to keep the ball in the air for more than 1,000 kicks. A court poet wrote at the time that the ball 'seemed suspended, hanging in the sky'. The emperor was said to have been so pleased that he retired the ball from active play and gave it a high-court rank. The Shiramine shrine, which provides dwelling for the kami , sits on land that has seen kemari played for nearly 900 years, which must make it one of the oldest sports sites in the world. It is recorded that the land was the former residence of Asukai, a member of the imperial court who was famous as an instructor and leader of kemari in the 12th century. Apart from playing a lot of kickball, he was known to also dabble in poetry, but it is said with much the same success at the modern-day footballer-poet, Eric Cantona. The shrine complex is busy with groups of Japanese schoolchildren when I arrived last week. After a rit ual purification of hands and mouth with water, the worshippers stand in front on the wooden shrine and summon the attention of the kami by ringing a bell. The prayers are accompanied by a series of bows, claps of the hands and a token offering of money. Worshippers also write their wishes and hopes on small wooden tablets, which they place around the shrine complex. Keizo, a 13-year-old soccer player from Saitama, wrote, 'I pray that I can always enjoy soccer.' Another student from the same school, Yoshi, explained why he came to the shrine. 'I come so I can play baseball well,' he says. The girls wrote of their wishes in tennis, volleyball and table tennis. 'I pray that I can always win!' said a very excitable table tennis player. Dreams of success in other sports such as rugby, hockey and athletics are all represented on the small wooden tablets. There are also a number of messages of support for the World Cup. One reads, 'For the success of the World Cup and may the Japanese players try hard.' It is not just schoolchildren who make trips to the shrine in Japan's historical and cultural capital. Lanterns with prayers and hopes from some of Japan's professional football teams hang from the eaves of the shrine - the names of Kyoto Purple Sanga, Vissel Kobe, Kawasaki Verdy and Yokohama FC can all be seen. I walked over to the Shrine office where a Shinto priest, dressed in white, hands out charms and amulets in return for a small donation. A bag of footballs with France 98 logos lay on the wooden platform next to the office. 'A gift from the Japanese team after the World Cup,' says the priest pointing to the balls. I asked him whether any of the Japanese team have made a visit to the shrine in preparation for the World Cup. 'Maybe some players come, but they come in secret with the wives or family', he said. 'Who will win the World Cup?', I asked as he prepared to worship. 'Japan. The gods are behind them'. \u00b7 James Davis travelled to the World Cup in Japan by land and sea, only passing through countries that had qualified for the finals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
