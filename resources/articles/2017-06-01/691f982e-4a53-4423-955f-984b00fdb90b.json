David Rank, a 27-year veteran state department officer, was appointed to serve as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Beijing in January last year. A state department spokeswoman confirmed Rank\u2019s departure but said she was unable to confirm reports that he resigned as he felt unable to deliver a formal notification to China of the US decision last week to quit the agreement. \u201cHe has retired from the foreign service,\u201d said Anna Richey-Allen, a spokeswoman for the department\u2019s East Asia bureau. \u201cMr Rank has made a personal decision. We appreciate his years of dedicated service to the state department.\u201d Iowa governor Terry Branstad, Donald Trump\u2019s pick as the next US ambassador to Beijing, is expected to take up the post later this month. A tweet from the China expert John Pomfret quoted unnamed sources as saying that Rank had resigned as he could not support Trump\u2019s decision last week to withdraw from the Paris agreement. In another tweet, Pomfret said Rank called a town hall meeting to announce his decision to embassy staff and explained that he could not deliver a diplomatic note informing the Chinese government of the US decision. A senior US official confirmed the account given in the tweets but added that after Rank announced his intention to retire on Monday in Beijing, he was told by the state department to leave his post immediately. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Rank, a career foreign service officer who took over the post of deputy chief of mission in Beijing in January 2016, could not immediately be reached for comment. Jonathan Fritz, the embassy\u2019s economics councillor, would serve as charg\u00e9 in his place, Richey-Allen said. Trump\u2019s announcement last Thursday that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, saying the agreement would undermine the US economy and cost jobs, drew anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
