Unbeaten in four outings, the last three over fences, since joining Murphy, former Irish point-to-pointer Truckers Tavern had his odds for the Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham slashed from 33-1 to 16-1 by Ladbrokes following his impresive display in the \u00a320,000 Barrie Cope Seafood Novice Chase. But next stop for Truckers Tavern is likely to be a Grade 2 event at Leopardstown on Sunday week. \"I'm not sure about Cheltenham. If it came up very soft he could go for the Arkle, but I'm not keen on the SunAlliance. We could wait for the three-miler at Aintree,\" said the winning trainer. Adrian Maguire, who reported that there was plenty of improvement in Truckers Tavern, completed a 135-1 treble on Occold and Stormhill Stag. Nigel Twiston-Davies ended a six-week losing spell when notching a double with Brambly Hedge and Cresswell Cherry. \"I haven't got a great bunch of horses, nor owners who can afford to spend fortunes. It's not rocket science,\" was how the trainer viewed his belated return to form."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
