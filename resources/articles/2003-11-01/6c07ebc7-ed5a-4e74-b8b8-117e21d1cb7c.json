The rain washed away the dust of the outback and the engine fired first time. And purred in the downpour. Richard Hill was back. The whole pack was back. The wing forward sorted out the bouncing, bobbling scraps, arranged the tight-side defence, and rearranged France. Neil Back was back to his best. Released from mother-henning the forwards in Hill's absence, he filled in at scrum half, centre or outside half. The libero. And Boy Bonkers was back. Jonny Wilkinson came out of therapy to play with a clear-headedness that drove France bonkers. Three drop goals and five penalties, I ask you. As for France, not one of them turned up. Not the fearsome scrummagers, not the back three runners. Not the back row. Olivier Magne had a horrible game on this horrible night. Washed away. And especially not Frederic Michalak. He who would usurp Wilkinson's mantle kicked wildly and was swallowed up by England's primary defence. The best thing for England was that it never threatened to be a lung-stretching runabout. It was too wet, and they were too dominant. Which means they have not drained themselves. So, on they go, back in form, to the final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
