Harm Our top story overnight is the leaked report from Serco which reveals a six-fold rise in rates of self-harm among asylum seekers in detention since the introduction of mandatory offshore resettlement. The full report also lays out several practices to clamp down on \"non-compliant\" asylum seekers, which have been criticised by one of Australia's foremost mental health experts as \"very dangerous\". The president of the Australian Human Rights Commission says that seven women have attempted suicide, threatened suicide or self-harmed at the Christmas Island detention centre in the past two days, but the immigration department would not confirm how many people had attempted suicide. The Australian reports that \"a handful\" of detainees have engaged in \"minor acts of self-harm\", and says Christmas Island authorities believe these are \"cynical attempts to follow three mentally ill young detainees into community detention\". The report shows a spike in self-harm in January this year, and warns of further increases as asylum seekers are held in detention for longer periods. Tony Abbott yesterday said the government would not give in to \"moral blackmail\" over the recent incidents, adding that asylum policy would not be changed based on individuals self-harming. David Marr writes on asylum policy, saying that the secrecy is designed to foil the law more than to frustrate people smugglers. Scott Morrison, who is currently in Sri Lanka, has defended the secrecy over 153 asylum seekers being held at sea by Australian authorities, reports the SMH. Human rights lawyer Julian Burnside has said the government may be guilty of piracy over its treatment of those asylum seekers, reports the ABC.
