The retailer managed to place 15.8m shares at 1050p per share, representing a discount of 4p on the previous day\u2019s closing share price, and equivalent to 13.7% of the company\u2019s share capital. The book and stationery chain\u2019s chief executive, Carl Cowling, was among the investors who bought shares. Shares in WH Smith have fallen by 56% since the start of the year but rose by as much as 4% during early trading on Tuesday. A day earlier, the company said it had secured a new lending facility of \u00a3120m, conditional on completing the equity raise. WH Smith issued a profits warning in March as travel restrictions triggered by the coronavirus pandemic led to a significant drop in shoppers at its airport outlets, initially in the Asia Pacific region, which accounts for 5% of its travel division\u2019s revenues. The company stated that its annual profits would be half the \u00a380m previously forecast. WH Smith is currently operating about 30% of its UK stores but has reported a \u201csignificant decline in passenger numbers\u201d because of the nationwide lockdown, which has resulted in the temporary closure of all of its stores at British airports and railway stations. The firm\u2019s 140 stores located in UK hospitals remain open, along with its 203 stores that contain Post Office counters. The group says the duration of the pandemic and effect on its financial performance remains uncertain, and it expects its April revenue to fall by 90% compared with the previous year. It is expecting 95% of its shops worldwide to remain closed and to reopen gradually. Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada, said WH Smith had been showing promising signs in the travel retail sector prior to the outbreak of Covid-19: \u201cWe think it should be a longer-term beneficiary of a recovery in travel trends, while its hospitals business and cost savings such as business rates provide some offset to very high short-term pressure on the air and rail segments.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
