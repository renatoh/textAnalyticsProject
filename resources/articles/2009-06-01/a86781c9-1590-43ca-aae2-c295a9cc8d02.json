In between taking Stephen Ferris and Leigh Halfpenny to hospital for scans on leg injuries that were to prove tour\u2011ending and dealing with the mix-up over Ryan Jones, the Lions' doctor was receiving updates from the Spanish football team on the head injury suffered by Cesc F\u00e1bregas against Azerbaijan. O'Driscoll, a cousin of the centre, Brian, is on his second Lions tour having spent the last eight years with Ireland, for whom his father, Barry, played at full\u2011back in the 1970s. In February, he became Arsenal's head doctor having supported Manchester United all his life. He was at Camp Nou in 1999 when United defeated Bayern Munich in the Champions League final; 10 years on, he found himself in the Arsenal dug-out when they played the then holders in this year's semi-final. Had Arsenal beaten United, they would have appeared in the Rome final in the first week of the Lions tour in South Africa. \"When I was offered the Arsenal job, I told them I wanted to fulfil my commitment to the Lions and they had no problem with that,\" said the 39-year-old. \"There was a point before the Lions gathered when Arsenal were in the last four of the FA Cup as well as the Champions League and both finals were during the Lions' first week on tour. The Lions would have released me for a couple of days to go to Rome, but the FA Cup final coincided with the Lions first match and I would have had to miss it. Unfortunately, Arsenal missed out twice.\" O'Driscoll surprised himself when he applied for the position at Arsenal vacated by Ian Beasley, who joined the England football team full-time. \"The position was advertised internationally and someone I knew rang me and suggested I apply,\" he said. \"I did not think I stood a chance, but thought it would be a good experience. I had three interviews, culminating in one that involved Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, a man whose aura strikes you immediately, and I ended up being offered the job. \"The fact I was a Manchester United supporter did not come into it. Rugby had always been my first love and it was a wrench to leave the Ireland team. I could not see out the Six Nations campaign because Arsenal wanted me to start at the end of February, but although I consulted friends and family, I was never going to turn down such a chance at one of the leading football clubs in the world. I am a professional, sports medicine is my field and I was being given an elite position. I have never regretted it.\" O'Driscoll, a member of the sports medicine steering group for London 2012, believes there is a lot that rugby and football can learn from each other. \"The nature of injuries tends to be different, with more to the upper body in rugby, reflecting the collision nature of the sport, but one aspect they have in common is that both games have a chronic fatigue element and recovery time is getting less and less as the powers that be want more matches. \"I believe that top rugby players should play no more than 30 matches a season, a number that is sometimes doubled in football. As players get fitter, stronger and more powerful, collisions become harder but adrenaline, desire and competitiveness, components of a top sportsman, mean they will never hold back. Again, it is the same in football, and I am fortunate that Ars\u00e8ne, unlike some rugby coaches I have worked with, never puts pressure on me to get a player back on to the field before he is fit.\" The England football team management will be in South Africa later this month to consult with O'Driscoll and the Lions' head doctor, James Robson, about the effects of playing at altitude with the World Cup being staged here in a year's time. \"Ian Beasley and Gary Lewin [the England physiotherapist] will watch the second Test with us in Pretoria,\" said O'Driscoll. \"Players on average need between 10 and 14 days to adjust to playing at altitude, but some need far more time than others. We spent the first couple of weeks here at altitude before coming down to sea-level and within two to three weeks all the benefits have worn off. We have brought four altitude machines with us so that players can use them in the gym: they get slightly less oxygen into the bloodstream and so mimic the effects of training at altitude and they are of benefit to those players we identified as taking longer to adjust. \"It is the same with injuries. Before we came on tour, we established that one-third of the players had suffered stinger injuries this season. Brian O'Driscoll and Jamie Roberts are the most reported cases, but they are among those who recover after a couple of minutes. Others can take a couple of weeks and it is essential that we know the details of each player so we can give them the appropriate treatment.\" O'Driscoll, who keeps in regular contact with Arsenal's medical team with a number of players recovering from injuries and operations, would like to go on a third Lions tour. \"I am totally committed to Arsenal,\" said O'Driscoll. It was a culture shock at first, especially the vitriol from crowds who swear and spit, showing a complete disregard for the achievements of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and I cannot understand why that behaviour is deemed acceptable in football. \"It is a 24-hours-a-day job because I insist on players calling me even to check on something they want to take for a minor injury. A difference between the two sports is that football players can afford to hire physiotherapists and even put them up at their homes to help with their rehab. They are in a way different worlds, bridged by sports medicine, and the two should work more closely together, as the Lions are with England.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
