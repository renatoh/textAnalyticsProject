Though it denied security was lax at the base, defence sources suggested that soldiers with hindsight were adopting too relaxed approach towards their own security. Their mindset was understandable, particularly for soldiers who had never experienced the Troubles, sources said. They said that the attack appeared to be an \"isolated incident\", but a telling factor would be how quickly the perpetrators would be caught. The security minister, Lord West, said yesterday there would be a reassessment of the resources allocated to counter-terrorism in Northern Ireland in the light of the shootings. MI5, which took overall responsibility for national security in Northern Ireland in 2007, allocates 15% of its total counter-terrorism budget to it. \"Inevitably when anything like this happens you look at it again,\" West said. \"These splinter groups we knew were forming. They don't reflect the vast majority of the population in Northern Ireland. They are prehistoric in their outlook really.\" MI5 has been warning for many months of the continuing threat posed by dissident republican groups. In an interview early this year Jonathan Evans, the head of MI5, said the threat had increased. The attack follows a public dispute last week between the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Sir Hugh Orde, and Sinn F\u00e9in over his confirmation of his request for surveillance by the army's Special Reconnaissance Regiment to deal with the dissident threat. They were deployed following the discovery of 300lb bomb at Castlewellan in Co Down. Until last Saturday's attack the police, and not the army, were all the known targets of dissident republicans. Speaking outside the army base in Antrim, Brigadier George Norton, commander of British troops in Northern Ireland, said it would have been difficult to fire back at the gunmen as they walked among injured soldiers. In face of criticism that none of the Northern Ireland Security Guard Service members opened fire, the Ministry of Defence said they had appropriate rules of engagement. The NISGS was set up in 1998 to free regular soldiers from the routine requirements of protecting perimeter fences and barrier entrances. \"It is about 450-strong and personnel are armed, for self-protection purposes and the protection of others,\" said a spokesman. Several members were on duty on Saturday evening when the attack began. They were stationed inside a small, two-storey guard tower at the entrance to the barracks and in a house just behind the main perimeter wall. Norton described the killings as a \"callous and clinical\" attack. The men, he said, \"had been waiting to deploy to Helmand province in Afghanistan. Their baggage was loaded and they were changed into desert uniforms. \"They were waiting for transport. Some of the men decided to order a final pizza before they left. Shortly before 10pm the pizza delivery arrived. The men were off-duty and unarmed. Following the attack the NISGS responded very quickly and professionally and undoubtedly saved lives. The military community is shocked by the brutality.\" Norton said he had spoken to the unit's commanding officer in Helmand and he was determined that the attack by a few \"loathsome individuals\" would not disrupt their mission overseas. Most of the unit had flown out from nearby Aldergrove airport early on Sunday morning, only hours after the murders. Asked why the security guards had not opened fire on the gunmen, he replied: \"Are you suggesting that people should have fired into a closely packed group including my soldiers? Both the guard service and soldiers came forward and did everything they could to save the lives of those who had been shot.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
