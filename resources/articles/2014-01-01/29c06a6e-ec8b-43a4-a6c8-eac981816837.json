The winger has not featured since the opening day of the season because of a knee injury but completed 45 minutes for Arsenal's under-21s in a 1-0 victory over Fulham in the last 16 of the Under-21 League Cup at Motspur Park. Oxlade-Chamberlain's return is a timely one for both club and country after it emerged that Walcott ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament in a knee during last Saturday's victory over Tottenham in the FA Cup. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has instructed his scouts to look for potential replacements for Walcott during the January transfer window, but will have been cheered by Oxlade-Chamberlain's first appearance for five months. After such a long spell on the sidelines, Oxlade-Chamberlain was understandably rusty in front of Arsenal's assistant manager, Steve Bould. However he was responsible for Arsenal's best moments in the first half and went close with a stinging volley from long range, before being withdrawn at half-timeThe 20-year-old may potentially be included in Wenger's squad for the trip to Aston Villa on Monday but a more realistic target is the visit of Fulham on 18 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
