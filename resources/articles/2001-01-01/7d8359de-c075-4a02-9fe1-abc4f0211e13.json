We like Kuching, too. Don't be disappointed that you missed the Cat Museum, it's not that impressive - and that is from a cat lover! We are a British couple living in Miri and would be delighted if you were to contact us when, or before, you arrive here. It is a good time to come, over the Chinese new year, as the inhabitants in town are predominantly Chinese and celebrate in style. We have been here six months after five years in Kuala Lumpur. We can give you handy hints on what Kuala Lumpur has to offer. There are Cybercafes in Miri! Do please contact us. Tel. No. (Miri code 085) 653600 Have a good trip to Sibu. Look forward to hearing from you. Regards, Jeremy and Gay"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
