International Olympic and Athens officials have said the worst is behind them, but a major Greek newspaper on Tuesday warned the country risked global \"humiliation\" if there were not some swift and drastic changes. Athens Olympics President Gianna Angelopoulos told Reuters in an interview that Greece - the smallest nation to host an Olympics since Finland in 1952 - had pulled off a \"miracle\" in getting ready after losing nearly two years through infighting. Asked to describe her mood ahead of the one-year mark, Angelopoulos replied: \"I don't believe there is any organiser in the world who could say one year before a games 'I'm relaxed'. But also I'm not worried.\" Greece's respected Kathimerini newspaper said in an editorial that blunders during test events last week, when rowers from Britain and the U.S. went under water because of strong winds and the German team withdrew with food poisoning, should \"ring alarm bells and mobilise Athens 2004\". \"... Athens 2004 must quickly tackle the organisational issues that threaten to torpedo next year's games, resulting in the humiliation of this country.\" the editorial said. But despite the mainly public relations disaster of the test events, Athens goes into the countdown with a ringing endorsement of their efforts from International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge: \"We are pleased by the pace of progress now,\" Rogge, who two years ago gave organisers a yellow card over the slow pace of preparations, told Reuters. \"Unless something unforeseen happens, they are going to make it if they keep up this pace.\" Athens issues resolved A massive building programme for city works as well as Olympic construction is back on deadlines and set to transform Athens into a modern European capital of new roads, subways, and a coastal esplanade. Court challenges when archaeological treasures were uncovered during the building programme have died down, as has infighting between government departments and games organisers that blighted early preparations. Athens many stray dogs are to be rounded up in a \"humane\" way, checked for diseases, treated and then released. Prostitutes have called off a strike they called when they saw their livelihoods threatened by what they believed was efforts to shut down brothels during the games from August 13 to 31 next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
