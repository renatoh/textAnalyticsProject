Yesterday the Rugby Football League moved to clarify the reasons why the player, who was fined, has been allowed to remain anonymous and keep playing - along with another of lower profile who also tested positive - while London 's Dominic Peters and Martin Moana of Halifax, were named and banned for 12 months and 28 days respectively. \"The release of the players ' identities has been suspended pending medical reports relating to each individual 's mental and personal welfare,\" an RFL statement said.\" This research has been carried out in conjunction with UK Sport who in turn are currently liaising with the World Anti-Doping Agency. Other sports ' governing bodies also follow this course of action as part of their anti-doping procedures.\" In the case of these two individuals, the spokesman continued, \"the RFL will release their identities if and as soon as the appropriate medical clearance is received \". Castleford 's captain Danny Orr is set to make an announcement on his future today - and Wigan sources suggest that future will be the JJB Stadium. Orr 's contract with the Tigers is up at the end of the season when he will be available for no transfer fee after turning 25 in May. Cas have made him a club-record three-year offer worth a total of more than \u00a3200,000 with the added attraction of a testimonial 2006,but after seven seasons with his hometown club the gifted half-back is expected move on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
