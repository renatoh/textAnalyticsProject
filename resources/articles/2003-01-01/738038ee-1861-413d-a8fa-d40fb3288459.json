Barcelona are confident Hasselbaink will agree to the move if they can strike a deal with Chelsea, who want about \u00a38m. Any agreement would probably hinge on the Stamford Bridge club accepting as part-payment the \u00a35m they still owe for Emmanuel Petit and Boudewijn Zenden. The Chelsea coach Claudio Ranieri has told Catalan radio that whether the striker \"goes or stays depends on how much money Barcelona put on the table\". Van Gaal is keen to pair Hasselbaink with Patrick Kluivert, and convinced Gaspart to back that view on Monday. Certain Barcelona board members were dubious about offering a lengthy deal to Hasselbaink, who will be 31 in March, but they believe he would accept a contract until the end of next season with the possibility of a further year should he fulfil expectations. \u00a3 Robbie Fowler is expected to be unveiled as a Manchester City player today after two days of medical tests. The striker was still undergoing checks last night after the club's insurers insisted on a rigorous examination for a player whose career was threatened by a hip injury at the start of the season. A City spokesman insisted last night that the deal is still expected to go through despite the intense tests. Fowler, who also has a history of knee and ankle injuries, has agreed personal terms for a 4-year deal. The deal would take the manager Kevin Keegan's spending to more than \u00a340m in 18 months at Maine Road, \u00a330m of it on strikers alone. The downside for Keegan is that spending City's entire transfer budget on Fowler has all but wrecked his hopes of signing David Sommeil from Bordeaux. City had proposed to sign him on loan, with a view to a permanent deal in the summer, but his club want a \u00a35m fee. \"I have to say that I fully understand Bordeaux,\" Sommeil said. \"They are asking for banking guarantees, but on the English side it is a bit jammed.\" \u00a3 Newcastle remain interested in the Marseille central defender Daniel van Buyten after their manager Sir Bobby Robson and chairman Freddie Shepherd attended the French club's game against Rennes on Tuesday. Manchester United have also had the player watched but are thought have dropped their interest. \u00a3 The Gary Lineker-led consortium moved a step closer to rescuing Leicester City from administration yesterday when creditors voted overwhelmingly in favour of them taking over the club. The Essex-based millionaire Mike Woodward's bid for Peterborough United has been rejected by representatives of Peter Boizot, the club's principal shareholder. Administrators for York City remain confident they can beat off extinction. Interested parties have until noon today to make an offer for the club. Martin O'Neill is set to belatedly join his Celtic players at their Florida training camp in Orlando today after missing the first three days. \"Martin has been away on club business and will join us on Thursday,\" said a spokesman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
