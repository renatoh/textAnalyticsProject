Boris Johnson will come under pressure today to respond to calls from inside his own party to explain an incident with his girlfriend on Friday night at her London flat. His Tory leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt, says he \u201cneeds to show he can answer difficult questions\u201d. It follows cabinet ministers, backbenchers and major party donors demanding an explanation about the late-night altercation that was heard by several neighbours. Hunt has accused Johnson of appearing willing to \u201cslink through the back door\u201d of No 10 by \u201cpathetically\u201d evading questioning. \u201cDon\u2019t be a coward Boris, man up,\u201d he wrote in today\u2019s edition of the Times, calling on him to stop avoiding public scrutiny. One Tory donor, who has given more than \u00a3500,000, told the Guardian that the issue was damaging the party. \u201cWe are a laughing stock,\u201d he said. Johnson\u2019s column in the Daily Telegraph this morning was silent on the incident, with the former foreign secretary preferring to focus on his bid to get the UK out of Europe by Halloween. Johnson is due to take part in a digital hustings with Tory party members today and has refused to say if he will face Hunt in a televised Sky News debate on Tuesday. * * * Istanbul\u2019s \u2018new page\u2019 \u2013 Turkey\u2019s biggest city has dealt a heavy blow to the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, delivering a landslide victory to another party\u2019s candidate in his home city\u2019s mayoral elections. The vote \u2013 a re-run of the 31 March poll which was also won by Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu from the People\u2019s Republican party, but cancelled by the electoral board \u2013 is being seen as a landmark because many feared democracy was failing. \u201cWe are starting a new page in Istanbul,\u201d \u0130mamo\u011flu told supporters. \u201cToday 16 million Istanbullus have refreshed our belief in democracy.\u201d His election will be seen as a blow for Erdo\u011fan, who built his political career in the city in the 1990s. * * * US-Iran \u2013 Donald Trump says Tehran\u2019s \u201cabsolutely broken\u201d economy will face \u201cmajor\u201d new sanctions on Monday. It comes as Iran has insisted it would step up its nuclear program unless Europe does more to shield the country from American pressure. Tensions remain high in the Gulf, despite Washington calling off airstrikes that had been planned in reprisal to the downing of a US drone on Thursday. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s hawkish national security adviser, warned Iran not to mistake US prudence for weakness. * * * Brexit\u2019s global Britain? \u2013 The government must make it easier for Indians to come to Britain to secure a post-Brexit trade deal, MPs from the cross-party Commons foreign affairs committee say. The group has told ministers they must either ease migration rules with one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies, or be honest that tough controls will kill off the prospect of a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d trading around the world after Brexit. It comes as a new report suggests the Irish border issue that has befuddled Brexit could be resolved within three years in the event of no-deal or the collapse of future trade talks with the EU. The report \u2013 to be unveiled by the Alternative Arrangements Commission on Monday \u2013 suggests special economic zones \u201ccovering frontier traffic and national security offer potentially valuable solutions\u201d, which could respect the realities of the border. But it would require buy-in from the DUP, something they have so far opposed. * * * Gambling addiction \u2013 The first NHS gambling clinic for children is opening amid growing concern that the rise of online gaming sites and targeted adverts is fuelling a problem among young people. There are 55,000 children classed as having a gambling problem in the UK, according to the Gambling Commission, which also found that 450,000 are gambling regularly \u2013 more than those who have taken drugs, drunk alcohol or smoked. Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, said: \u201cThis action shows just how seriously the NHS takes the threat of gambling addiction, even in young people. * * * Sperm in space \u2013 All-female astronaut crews could reproduce without the help of accompanying men, new research suggests. The study found that frozen samples of sperm exposed to microgravity retained similar characteristics to sperm samples kept on the ground, raising hopes that a sperm bank could one day be set up in space to help populate new worlds, including potentially on Mars. Today in Focus podcast: What has changed since the Stonewall rebellion? The Stonewall rebellion in 1969 started a revolution in LGBT rights in the US. Ed Pilkington revisits the story 50 years on with those who were there. Plus: Lucy Seigle on the rise of fast fashion. Lunchtime read: The new armpit hair revolution Female body hair is making a comeback, writes Rebecca Thus-Dubrow. But today\u2019s renewed enthusiasm for female hirsuteness comes with a distinctly 21st-century twist. Unshaven women in 2019 often meet other criteria for traditional feminine beauty \u2013 they have sculpted eyebrows, wear lipstick or sexy lingerie \u2013 while proudly displaying their armpit hair. If the ethos of the 70s was a refusal to spend time and effort on cosmetics, the more common approach today is for women to curate different elements of their appearance, remaining conventionally attractive while deploying body hair as a feminist fuck-you: half-statement, half-ornament. Sport England\u2019s women are through to the last eight of the World Cup after a bruising encounter with Cameroon that left coach Phil Neville fuming about how the African team had \u201cshamed football\u201d. Neville said: \u201cI\u2019m completely and utterly ashamed of the opposition and their behaviour.\u201d In the other last-16 tie, France scored an extra-time winner to defeat Brazil 2-1. Andy Murray marked his return to competitive tennis by winning the men\u2019s doubles title at Queen\u2019s with Feliciano L\u00f3pez, but he will partner Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert when he targets the Wimbledon title next week. South Africa are out of the Cricket World Cup after losing by 49 runs to Pakistan at Lord\u2019s while England\u2019s Jofra Archer will put his friendship with Australia\u2019s Steve Smith to one side when they clash at headquarters tomorrow. And Australian rugby star Israel Folau has had his fundraising page for his legal challenge against Rugby Australia over a homophobic social media post taken down for breaching GoFundMe\u2019s terms of service. Business The tensions in the Middle East saw the price of oil rise in early trade on Monday, with a barrel of Brent crude up 0.6% to $65.58. Asia Pacific stocks were lower but the threat of sanctions against Iran rather than a full-scale military intervention by the US kept prices from plunging. At home, a new report has found that most forms of Brexit will worsen the country\u2019s finances and reduce space for new initiatives to address child poverty, social care and left-behind communities that some argue drove the Brexit vote. The report by academics at the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank said: \u201cMost forms of Brexit will worsen the government\u2019s fiscal position, probably significantly, reducing the space for new policy initiatives.\u201d The pound is buying \u20ac1.120 and and $1.275. The papers Boris Johnson\u2019s attempts to deflect questions about his domestic disharmony seem not to be working as several papers have him being urged to \u201ccome clean\u201d about what went on. The Guardian has: \u201cHunt piles pressure on Johnson over police visit\u201d. The Times reports: \u201cJohnson is a coward, says Hunt\u201d. The Express says: \u201cPressure on Boris to come clean\u201d and the i has: \u201cJohnson urged to deal with domestic row\u201d. The Mail is more sympathetic to the Tory leadership contender: \u201cBoris and girlfriend driven out of home\u201d, as is the Telegraph, which runs a write-off of his weekly column as its lead story: \u201cBoris: I won\u2019t bottle Brexit\u201d. The Mirror quotes anonymous \u201cpals\u201d who say that \u201cBoris \u2018wants to get back with his wife\u2019\u201d, and the Sun has its own anonymous friends who say: \u201cBoris and Carrie 4 rows in 6 wks\u201d. The FT, the only paper not to splash on Boris Johnson today, has: \u201cLloyds froze 8,000 accounts amid offshore dirty-money crackdown\u201d.
