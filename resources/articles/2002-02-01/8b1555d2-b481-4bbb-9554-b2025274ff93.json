Eriksson has said he already knows \"15 or 16\" of those who will go, barring injuries. But on the last half-dozen places he is open to persuasion. In some cases Eriksson has to consider whether players are fit to wear the jersey. In Darren Anderton's case it is just whether he is fit. It is the inevitable agenda Anderton brings to any table - Eriksson's, the physio's or Ikea's. On Thursday Anderton rapped the formica at Tottenham Hotspur's training ground: \"Touch wood,\" he said, \"not bad, aches and pains but nothing to worry about. But yeah, 100%. Yeah.\" That his fingers did not snap when he did this is the kind of facetious joke about Anderton's injury-plagued past he finds exasperating. If you give a player a bad name, and Sicknote is a bad name for a professional sportsman, it sticks. Anderton thought about that on Tuesday night after completing his 300th match for Tottenham against Bolton, a one-sided contest in which he shone in front of Eriksson. \"Three hundred games over 10 years,\" he said, \"that's 30 games a year, which when you think about it is not the disaster that's out there. And I had bad times, three or four years that were nasty.\" By \"out there\" Anderton meant public perception: good player, bit flimsy, always injured except for a World Cup year. Even Anderton conceded there was an element of truth to this, or at least he understood why it came about, though it was the season prior to Euro 96 where the stereotype originated. Anderton started three games in September 1995, then three more the following April and May. Groin and ham string were the problems but, when it came to England in the summer, Anderton played all five matches. But, tournament over, the next two seasons were then interrupted by injuries again and, with Glenn Hoddle managing England, Eileen Drewery infamously became involved in Anderton's treatment. Now that Hoddle is at Spurs, Drewery is again there if Anderton feels the need. \"I haven't been for a while,\" he said. \"I was one of those who said, 'Nah, not for me.' I needed convincing to go but I'm glad I did and I would always say to people: 'Don't knock it till you try it.' \"It's healing really, hands on,\" he said, by way of explanation as to what Drewery does. \"I was struggling with a hamstring. I would train and for the next 10 days or two weeks it would be like a rock. I mean, I had a little tear in my hamstring that went on for eight months. I went to see her and she came up with a stretch that I needed to do. I'm still doing it and I haven't had a problem with the hamstring since. It's something that's worked for me.\" That depends on how one looks at it. Immediately before France 98 Anderton started only seven Spurs games. Three of those seven again came in the final three fixtures, though, and what happened in France? Anderton played all four games, scoring against Colombia in Lens. Had he not been replaced by David Batty against Argentina, it might have been Anderton taking that penalty. Even so he has played nine tournament finals games in a row, which only David Seaman, Tony Adams and Alan Shearer equalled. \"Both times I was injured after the turn of the year,\" said Anderton. \"I got back for the last few games. Yeah, I was a little bit lucky.\" Yet Anderton's fragile reputation persisted. It continues to niggle like a sore achilles, his last serious injury. But, surprise, surprise the cynics mock, this season Anderton, at 29, has found form and fitness once more. Tuesday's match was his 30th of the season and the concern this time must be that, come the end of the campaign, he will have used up his quota. But he was in Eriksson's last squad and, given his experience, he must be in the Swede's thoughts for Japan. Anderton, though, has refused to construct hopes based on another man's thoughts. He was deliberately cautious on the subject of selection, a shield against disappointment. \"I've done it,\" he said, \"I've played in a World Cup.\" Then, sensing perhaps that this sounded uncharacteristically big-time and couldn't-care-less, Anderton swiftly added: \"But that makes you want it more, the whole thing, the whole country behind you. And of course we've got a very good squad.\" Reluctant to discuss his own chances, Anderton was more open about the man sitting in the other corner of the room, 21-year-old Ledley King. When asked to nominate an outsider who might make it to Japan, Anderton looked over and said: \"Ledley\" and his justification was that \"not much has been said about Sol [Campbell] leaving, or about how we've missed him. That's because all our defenders have done brilliantly this season and Ledley has done very well. He's very calm on the ball, probably suited to international football. He's always been calm, very mellow, a good lad. He could have a chance.\" Eriksson should confirm that opinion this evening. Anderton, too, is expected to get the call again and, if he plays in Holland, it will be his 31st cap. He has been part of the left-side England debate despite playing all season in central midfield for Tottenham. The role, he said, has contributed to his consistency of quality and appearance. \"I'm more involved and it's more enjoyable, to be honest; I'm not relying on people giving me the ball. And I'm playing in a team that plays good football. The main emphasis is on us and you can tell by the way the lads are around the place that it's very enjoyable. It's a good place to be. \"The manager wants me to be more creative. George [Graham] was well-known for his defensive qualities, as such, and that was very important to him, which obviously isn't my strength. But I'll always track back and do my bit, I am not a lazy winger. I wouldn't say I was a good tackler but I'll always have a go. When you're match fit and feeling great, it makes a massive difference. I think that's the stage I've been at this season, more so than the last three or four. But I'm not trying anything different. I'm just playing.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
