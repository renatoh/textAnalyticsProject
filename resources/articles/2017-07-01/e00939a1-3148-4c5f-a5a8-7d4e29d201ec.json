On the contrary, England\u2019s principal striker \u2013 who, courtesy of exquisite movement and sublime timing, has registered four goals from five chances \u2013 could not be more excited to be in the Netherlands. As Taylor sits chatting enthusiastically about her parents\u2019 trip over from Merseyside and how they are now \u201cbuzzing\u201d about the Lionesses advancing to the knockout stages, she appears very much on a mission to make up for lost time. Although she is 31, this is only the second major tournament for a woman who did not win her first cap until 2014. Small wonder she jokes about \u201csleeping with the ball\u201d following her hat-trick against Scotland last week. Rewind four years and Taylor was a frustrated spectator when Hope Powell\u2019s England exited Euro 2013 in Sweden at the group stage. \u201cI was playing in Sweden at the time, for Goteborg,\u201d says a forward France may struggle to stop in Sunday\u2019s quarter-final in Deventer. \u201cA lot of my team-mates were in the Swedish side. They were on fire [and reached the semi-final]. I remember sitting in the stadium in Gothenburg watching them and just thinking: \u2018I know I should be here.\u2019 \u201cIt was probably the first time I\u2019d thought: \u2018I should be here\u2019 rather than just: \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll get a chance to go to an England camp.\u2019 So it was a bit of a turning point. \u201cIt was the first time I knew I was good enough for England. In the past I maybe hadn\u2019t been valued by certain people so I hadn\u2019t had the belief but, suddenly, I thought: \u2018Regardless of what anyone else says, I know I deserve to be playing for England\u2019.\u201d Taylor emailed Powell but the former national coach remained unmoved and it was not until Mark Sampson took over that she got her chance. Sampson\u2019s faith in her is such that he took her to the last World Cup in Canada when she was recovering from knee surgery. The Welshman has stuck by a centre-forward whose movement he describes as \u201cworld class\u201d as she overcame a more recent achilles problem. \u201cI really feel the belief and confidence and trust from Mark,\u201d she says. \u201cThat has been huge for me through the tough times \u2013 knowing I\u2019m still valued.\u201d Watching Taylor\u2019s irresistible amalgam of intuitive positioning, devastating change of pace and apparently nerveless finishing, the only puzzle is how on earth she failed to win a senior cap until the grand old age of 28. Maybe it was down to her rarely being domestically based. When she is not climbing the goal charts, Taylor collects passport stamps. Since leaving Birkenhead and Tranmere Rovers\u2019 attack to begin a sports scholarship at Oregon State University, she has \u201cclub-hopped\u201d between North America, Australia and northern Europe. Along the way she has felt the chill of a Canadian winter and the heat of southern hemisphere summers. Currently at Arsenal, Taylor has, in no particular order, lived in Melbourne, Sydney, Gothenburg, Ottawa, Boston, Los Angeles, Washington, Portland, Birmingham, Lincoln and now London. Then there was a brief sojourn as assistant manager of Fresno State Bulldogs, a Californian university side. The Netherlands may lack the glamour of the Pacific coast but its air evidently suits her. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll score every time now,\u201d she says. \u201cFor strikers it\u2019s a mental game, it\u2019s up and down, sometimes you\u2019re on a drought, sometimes everything you hit goes in. Fortunately, everything\u2019s going right at the moment. \u201cI think it\u2019s just down to my confidence \u2013 I\u2019m relaxed, I\u2019m composed. Our preparation\u2019s been really good; I\u2019ve had a lot of time working on finishing and lots of time with the team. That shows in front of goal.\u201d Taylor has also done her homework. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying the goalies,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to watch a lot of footage of them in one-to-one situations. When we played Spain, I knew their goalie flies off her line. For my goal against them she went down early, so I knew to dink it over her. Watching her definitely helped. \u201cI also do visualisation. It helps with defenders. You watch five or six video clips and you start to see people\u2019s tendencies and are able to visualise what they\u2019ll do in games. \u201cThen I replay goals in my mind and visualise scenarios that might happen. Half the time it\u2019s irrelevant but sometimes it means you\u2019re ready for that one chance.\u201d Such diligence is helping her confound the notion that, past 30, strikers decline. \u201cI don\u2019t think about my age at all,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI\u2019ve been unfortunate with injuries but I\u2019m in a really good place right now. Physically, there\u2019s still more to come from me, I think. At 31 I certainly don\u2019t feel anywhere near the end of my career.\u201d After the disappointment of going to Canada 2015 less than half fit, she fully deserves her place this summer. \u201cIt was just a lateral meniscus tear,\u201d Taylor recalls. \u201cBut it was an eight-to-10-week recovery time frame and the World Cup was in six weeks. The surgeon was great and I\u2019ve got no issues with my knee now but I was certainly pushing through it in Canada and for a few months beyond. But that was 100% my call. After not getting an England call up for years, I wasn\u2019t missing that tournament.\u201d Her reward came with the opening goal in a 2-1 quarter-final victory over Canada in front of 54,000 at Vancouver\u2019s BC Place as Sampson\u2019s Lionesses headed for third spot. Now England are aiming to finish first \u2013 and Taylor as Euro 2017\u2019s top scorer. \u201cEvery forward wants to win the golden boot,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I would take a gold medal over a golden boot, 100%.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
