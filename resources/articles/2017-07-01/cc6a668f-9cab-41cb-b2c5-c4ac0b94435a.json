A new report found that there has been a 12% rise in audiences at live music events over the past 12 months, bringing \u00a34bn in to the UK economy and providing a welcome boost for the music industry. UK Music\u2019s study, Wish You Were Here, found that audience numbers had hit 30.9 million, up from 27.7 million in 2015, with 4 million people attending the ever-growing number of British music festivals in 2016. It is further evidence that the live sector is one of the most vibrant and profitable parts of the music industry, and it is through ticket sales and merchandise that most musicians generate the majority of their revenue. The research found that people were increasingly willing to travel from other parts of the UK, and even from abroad, to attend live music events. Music tourism rose by 20% in 2016, and almost 1 million people travelled to the UK from abroad specifically to attend concerts and festivals, spending an average of \u00a3850. The chief executive of UK Music, Michael Dugher, said: \u201cLive music in the UK is a tremendous success story and makes a massive contribution to our culture and general wellbeing, as well as our economy. It showcases our talent to the world and brings pleasure to millions every day.\u201d However, the report also found that there was a sharp fall in the amount of money being spent at smaller venues \u2013 those with a capacity of below 1,500. These are the venues that have been closing in their droves over the past decade, declining by 35% in London thanks to rising costs, pressures from property developers and strict licensing laws. Dugher emphasised that the smaller venues were a \u201cvital part of the live music industry\u201d. \u201cUK Music will continue to campaign to safeguard smaller music venues, many of which are fighting for survival,\u201d the former Labour MP said. She was echoed by Juliette Carter, a British manager whose roster has included R&amp;B singer Dawn Richard and Awful Records\u2019 Ethereal. \u201cWhilst it is great to see the live industry flourishing, it is vital we continue to support smaller venues which serve as the foundation for tomorrow\u2019s festival headliners,\u201d said Carter. \u201cAs a music manager, I\u2019ve seen first hand how it is in these spaces that artists develop and grow and cut their teeth. Without them, the UK live music sector just becomes bland, expensive stadium shows and the whole music industry will be less diverse as a result.\u201d The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, said: \u201cUK Music\u2019s Wish You Were Here report clearly shows music and the creative industries are not only central to our cultural DNA but also hugely important for creating jobs and growth across the country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
