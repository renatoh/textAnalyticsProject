Entitled Women, Power and Politics, the five-week-long season will feature new plays by 12 writers (all but one of them women), including Bola Agbaje, Zinnie Harris, Rebecca Lenkiewicz and Lucy Kirkwood. The idea is to explore women's role in politics, both historically and recently; alongside the new plays will be a series of verbatim monologues, adapted by Gillian Slovo from interviews with female politicians, among them Shirley Williams, Jacqui Smith and Ann Widdecombe. If it all goes down the pan at the general election, a fresh career in standup could be just around the corner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
