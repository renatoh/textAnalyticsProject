His political tin ear has been one of the more consistent features of this Labour government. He got things off to a quick start with his authorisation of \u00a3650,000 of redecoration expenses for the lord chancellor's official residence - including Pugin wallpaper priced at \u00a3350 a roll - and compounded the error by snobbishly suggesting he could hardly kit out his quarters with any old rubbish from B &amp; Q. He was soon comparing himself to Cardinal Wolsey, not realising how badly that would play with an electorate already suspicious of the arrogance of politicians. And more recently he provoked cries of cronyism and discrimination after hiring a chum to fill a top job that had never been advertised. So no one will be surprised that the mighty lord chancellor has once again put his stockinged foot in it. His error this time is to have walked into the sleazy minefield that is party funding. It now emerges that Lord Irvine signed a letter inviting lawyers to a Labour bash earlier this month where they would be squeezed for donations. Mega-brain Irvine was too dim to realise the glaring inappropriateness of his actions. He did not see what everyone else would: that he was seeking funds from people whose careers he can make or break. As the head of the judiciary, a lord chancellor exercises personal control over the promotion of lawyers and judges. It is he who can, at the wave of a pen, transform a mere barrister into a queen's counsel. Yet, happy that his action broke no law, he could not see the problem. He did not foresee the obvious headlines that would greet his move: cash for wigs. Yet political clumsiness is not a resigning offence; nor is hosting an ill-judged event which breaks no law. So Derry Irvine will be safe - but the same should not be true of his job. For the noble peer's actions have exposed not only his own limitations as a politician, but also the absurd contradictions of the office he occupies. It is a post which does not just risk conflicts of interest - it makes them almost inevitable. A lord chancellor wears at least three hats (in addition to the pantomimic piece of headgear he wears for special occasions). He is, simultaneously, a top-ranking member of the cabinet, speaker of the second chamber and head of the judiciary. In other words, three branches of government - executive, legislature and judiciary - strenuously kept separate in other democracies, are fused together in Britain in the body of one man. The fact that he is unelected, and unaccountable to an elected chamber, only adds to the indefensibility of the post. And now we know, thanks to Lord Irvine, that lord chancellors often wear another hat: they can be fund-raisers for their party. The charitable might say this latest row is not Derry Irvine's fault. The problem is not the arrogance of the man; it is the arrogance of the job. There is a simple way to clear up this mess. It is time to shut the lord chancellor's department and replace it with a ministry of justice headed by a member of the House of Commons. Judges could then be named, in the open, by an independent judicial appointments commission - perhaps with public, televised hearings for nominees to the highest courts. This used to be Labour policy until Lord Irvine decided it would be more congenial to maintain the old, secret system of \"soundings.\" So Mr Blair need not sack his old mentor before the general election. He can do something much more radical: abolish his job. Talk about it Should Lord Irvine resign?
