The Italian transport minister said security in the tunnel would be stepped up. French authorities said the eight-mile Fr\u00e9jus tunnel linking Lyon and Turin had been shut \"for an indeterminate time\" after a truck carrying tyres burst into flames that engulfed at least three other vehicles. Two Slovenian truck drivers in their early 20s were killed. Italian and French ministers met at the scene and praised coordination between the two countries' firefighters. The blaze revived memories of a 1999 inferno in the nearby Mont Blanc tunnel that burned for two days and left 39 people dead. Rescue workers told France-2 television that temperatures had risen so high in the Fr\u00e9jus tunnel on Saturday that the road's tar had melted under their feet. The tunnel accounts for four-fifths of truck traffic between the countries. Most will be rerouted through Mont Blanc."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
