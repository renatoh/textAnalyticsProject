Almost a year since they left the Catalans smarting at a tedious goalless draw, which paved the way for eventual Uefa Cup success, Liverpool return to the Nou Camp with the latest bout of put-downs from Barcelona's players ringing in their ears. All subtlety clearly goes out the window when it comes to mind games here, with Barca's Dutch international Frank de Boer saying: \"I'd hate to play for Liverpool. I can't stand the boring way they play.\" Amid the petty talk, it might be easy to forget that the Anfield club's Champions League prospects hang by a thread tonight. \"We will play as we always play,\" insisted their midfielder Dietmar Hamann.\"We don't care what anyone says about us. All we want is to play successful football and that's what we've produced over the last two years. Our style gets results; defence is the basis for football.\" That will hardly be music to Catalan ears, though for once in a troubled season at the Nou Camp the pressure is very much on the visitors. Liverpool languish at the foot of a tight group without a win and with only two goals to their name. Defeat would mean elimination; a draw would leave them teetering and depending upon Roma failing to beat Galatasaray. \"There would be nothing better than going to the Nou Camp and winning,\" said the caretaker manager Phil Thompson. \"We are looking to push on and beyond the second phase. We have lost one game in Europe during the last two years, while Manchester United didn't even get into the second stage in their first two years. \"With the strength we have at the back, the guile in midfield and pace up front, our realistic target at the start of the season was to win the competition. That belief is still there.\" Emulating their 1976 win in this city - that 1-0 success remains English football's only victory against Barcelona at the Nou Camp - without the injured Michael Owen's pace will be all the more difficult. Yet Jari Litmanen, returning to the club he left last season, should offer a less predictable route to goal as Liverpool, unbeaten in 14 continental trips stretching back to 1998, aim to wipe the memory of their 3-1 home humbling to these opponents in November. Barcelona (4-2-3-1, probable): Bonano; Puyol, De Boer, Christanval, Coco; Xavi, Cocu; Luis Enrique, Rivaldo, Saviola; Kluivert. Liverpool (4-4-2, probable): Dudek; Xavier, Henchoz, Hyypia, Carragher; Murphy, Gerrard, Hamann, Riise; Heskey, Litmanen. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
