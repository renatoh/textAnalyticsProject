His team have risen from the foot of the Premier League courtesy of the rumbustious victory over Leicester City. Clint Hill had just collared him in the corridor to declare himself fit \u201cif required\u201d for Tuesday\u2019s trip to Swansea and even the stiffness in Bobby Zamora\u2019s back had eased overnight to suggest he might also be in contention at the Liberty Stadium. Rangers have a striker in prolific form in Charlie Austin, an experienced centre-half in Richard Dunne to return from suspension in Wales and renewed optimism over their prospects of staying up. With five points covering the bottom nine clubs in a mishmash of a division, a team\u2019s attitude suddenly seems critical. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very lucky in that respect because mine are a good group of lads,\u201d Redknapp said. \u201cI\u2019m more confident [of staying up] this time round. It ain\u2019t just the 11 who play. It\u2019s about the whole squad. That\u2019s what makes a club. If you\u2019ve got half a dozen shits around, you\u2019ve got no chance. You can\u2019t win. They\u2019ll contaminate the rest of them, getting into good lads and bringing them down to their level.\u201d This cleansed collective have started to suggest over recent weeks that they boast qualities \u2013 the most obvious of which is arguably a spirit of unity \u2013 that can preserve top-flight status. That reference to faeces was a throwback to the mess in which Redknapp found the squad when taking up the reins a little over two years ago, an awkward blend of cliques thrust together in a series of transfer splurges by successive managers. They were an ill-balanced and bloated group of journeymen and veterans. Rewind to December 2012 and a draw against Aston Villa in the new man\u2019s second game in charge left QPR bottom and winless after 15 matches, seven points adrift of safety. That squad had included such as the European Cup winners Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa \u2013 who would endure a public falling-out with the management before the end of the campaign \u2013 and Djibril Ciss\u00e9, and Brazil\u2019s No1, J\u00falio C\u00e9sar. St\u00e9phane Mbia had played in the Champions League with Marseille, and Esteban Granero was formerly of Real Madrid. Redknapp did not pinpoint the problems but egos were clearly an issue. These days his public dressing-downs are more normally reserved for Adel Taarabt, still absent with a groin injury, but the message transmitted was clear enough: he had not stood a chance so finishing bottom with 25 points was almost an inevitability. This time around will be different. \u201cIt was hard back then,\u201d he said. \u201cDifficult but this is a new lot of lads and they\u2019re good. Niko Kranjcar hasn\u2019t been in the side the last couple of weeks but trained like a demon last week, working hard, practising after training, wanting to get back into the team. He got his chance on Saturday and came in and did well. Rio Ferdinand wasn\u2019t playing against Leicester but he stood alongside me in the dugout, shouting out to the players, kicking every ball, being as involved as I was in the game. He wants us to win. That\u2019s what you need. You don\u2019t want someone sitting there with a face like thunder, giving you needle or not giving a shit. People like that suck as much energy out of you as anything. You\u2019re always watching them, checking who they\u2019re talking to and what they\u2019re doing. Not for me. \u201cWhereas if you have a good group of lads who want to train hard \u2026 it gives you a chance. If we hadn\u2019t won on Saturday we\u2019d have been bang in trouble, cut right adrift. Now we\u2019re back in the pack again and that makes a big difference. And we\u2019re playing well. We played well against Manchester City, Liverpool and Aston Villa. People have settled in. The Chileans [Eduardo Vargas and Mauricio Isla] have settled in, [Leroy] Fer is looking a player. We look a much better team suddenly.\u201d The industry has to allow the team\u2019s most talented performers to influence contests. Crystal Palace were wonderfully well organised by Tony Pulis last season and that framework allowed Jason Puncheon or Yannick Bolasie to excel. The current bottom three comprise the promoted clubs, but each have their own qualities: Leicester may be without a win in eight but they boast the pace up front to disturb opponents; Burnley are a tightly drilled unit unbeaten in three who will hope Danny Ings\u2019 scoring form is prolonged. Of the others, West Bromwich Albion have Saido Berahino, Aston Villa have Christian Benteke, and QPR, in Austin, have a player with five goals in as many games. Ease the pressure on his shoulders by securing a Jermain Defoe or Gary Hooper in the winter window and their firepower might set QPR apart. \u201cCharlie has to keep improving his all-round game, his hold-up play, but his confidence is so high now,\u201d Redknapp said. \u201cHe was wondering if he could score in the Premier League and then missed a penalty in the last five minutes against Hull on the opening day which might have got us a point. So, suddenly, questions are asked. Now he\u2019s on the pitch knowing he deserves to be there. Confidence is key in life. If you\u2019ve got it, you\u2019ve got a chance.\u201d A trip to Swansea appears daunting, particularly for a team yet to register a point on their travels, yet QPR\u2019s next three games at Loftus Road are against Burnley, West Brom and Palace. Seven of their 11 points this term have come in the last three home games and, Hull aside, they have taken reward from all of their meetings against teams in the bottom nine. That number stretches from Stoke City down in a congested lower half. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Stoke will get relegated but they\u2019re not out of it, are they?\u201d Redknapp said. \u201cThey\u2019re a decent team but there have been decent teams before who have gone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
