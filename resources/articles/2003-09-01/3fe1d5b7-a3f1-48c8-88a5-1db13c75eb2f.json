The party's transport spokesman, Tim Collins, also predicted that he would have a better working relationship with the \"awkward squad\" rail union leader Bob Crow than that enjoyed by the current transport secretary, Alistair Darling. Dismissing the \"optimism\" felt by the prime minister when he opened the first section of the channel tunnel rail link today, Mr Collins told Guardian Unlimited that the rail system now has \"the worst of both worlds - having neither the clear democratic accountability of a clearly nationalised industry nor the financial discipline and incentives to innovate of the private sector.\" \"Even in a year there seems to have been a considerable shift amongst many rail observers towards the view that bad though Railtrack was, Network Rail seems at the moment to be even worse,\" he said. \"If privatisation had got a very bad name by the first couple of years of the 21st century renationalisation is not proving a great success either.\" Ruling out the reprivatisation Network Rail, Mr Collins promised to impose \"financial discipline\" on the track and stations operator, abolish one of the rail regulators and rein in the strategic rail authority's \"empire building ambitions\". \"The biggest crisis facing the rail industry at the moment is the absence of financial discipline on Network Rail,\" he argued. \"The most important challenge is to bring financial discipline back to Network Rail. \"Even if you were simply going to bring Network Rail back, in the first instance, up to the standards of financial probity that an average government department has, you would be making a major leap forward from where we are at the moment. And in words that will unnerve many of Network Rail's senior management and alarm passenger groups, Mr Collins continued: \"The second thing is that we will want to look at the background of some of the people who are seriously involved with Network Rail. \"There's always a case with the rail industry that it swings across the years from periods where you have engineers in charge, and they spend money like water, to periods when you have accountants in charge, and they don't spend any money at all. And as in most things, the sensible place you want to be is somewhere in the middle. \"But post-Hatfield, post-Potters Bar and post-Railtrack you've actually got a world where the engineer is so dominant in terms of being king that the engineer can go in to a manager and say this needs to be done, and if they cap that by saying this needs to be done on health and safety grounds the manager will just role over and say that's fine, go ahead and do it. \"Now no organisation can sensibly operate on that procedure for long, and you've actually got to improve the financial management in Network Rail. And that's something we want to look at very, very carefully. Turning to the rail regulators, Mr Collins said: \"There is a role for having a strategic rail authority (SRA), [but] I think it is proving too interventionist, too bureaucratic, too centralist. \"We would want to see it returning to the original concept that the present government set out for it - that it should be providing a light-touch regulatory sense of direction over a 10 or 20-year planning period, and that it should not be getting into the nitty-gritty of specifying how often the loo seats are up on a commuter train. Asked how he would seek to tame the SRA, Mr Collins replied: \"We will want to have a very careful look at its administrative budget and the number of people it employs. \"And I think if we bare down very hard on both of those, that will provide a further very clear signal that they need to get back to their original role rather than perhaps some of the empire-building ambitions that they've been pursuing more recently. \"The final thing I'd say in this context is that having the SRA, Network Rail and the Office of the Rail Regulator - three public sector bodies - is probably one to many, and there is a case for merging two of them together. Mr Collins disputed that that would necessarily entail merging the SRA and the Office of the Rail Regulator, saying: \"There is a case for saying maybe merge the SRA with Network Rail - Network Rail is for all intents and purposes a wholly owned subsidiary of the SRA. I think we want to move from having three bodies to two bodies. On his relationship with one of Britain's most militant union general secretaries, Mr Crow of the RMT, Mr Collins predicted a better one than he currently has with his government counterpart. \"With at least some union leaders I suspect paradoxically their relationship might be better with a Tory government than with a Labour one. First of all because they would be no illusions, and secondly because I would hope we would be less prone to spin and more in a position to be straight with people. \"There is no ideological baggage, there is no sense that we're coming from part of the same movement and that one of us is an apostate and one of us is staying with the true faith. If you look within the Christian religion it is often much easier for a Protestant sect to get on with Catholics than it is for them to get on with a different Protestant sect. \"It is easier for you to do deals with people you know are different than people who you expect to be the same.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
