But if anyone can get past this terrifying twosome it is a man who has done it already this year. Mike Weir , the Canadian left-hander, is the US Masters champion and a tempting each-way bet at 16-1. RICHARD WILLIAMS Just about the only American to emerge with credit from last year's Ryder Cup was David Toms , and the nerveless 36-year-old from Louisiana may relish a return to Britain. He has had two Tour wins and a second place thus far this season; three years ago he tied for fourth place at St Andrews. MIKE SELVEY An Open record of 37th, 57th, a missed cut and 69th does not suggest a pedigree to take this title. Then came Mike Weir 's victory in this year's US Masters and with it a change in the world's perception. He is in superb form with three third places in four tournaments since his major triumph. PAUL KELSO The Open is ripe for a European winner and Darren Clarke has perhaps as good a shot as any. Having learned his game on the brutal links at Portrush, the conditions will be familiar. He has finished in the top 10 three times in six Opens, and if he can hole his putts and stay interested he has a chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
