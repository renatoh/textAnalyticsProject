In a thoughtful and frank discussion with Michael Williams as part of Guardian Australia\u2019s monthly book club, hosted over Zoom in partnership with Australia At Home and Sydney writers\u2019 festival, Garner delved into topics of regret, reader backlash and the anxieties she felt in poring over her scribbled-down past to make it ready for public consumption. \u201cI would wake up at 2am and I would think, how can I possibly say that? How can I put that in?\u201d Garner said. \u201cThen I\u2019d get up in the morning and sit at the desk and look at the passage and I\u2019d realise as usual \u2026 that it seems, in daylight, quite different. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s a part of you that doesn\u2019t function at 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. \u2026 I experienced that over and over and over.\u201d She described the experience as being \u201ca bit like being a ghost in your former life, just hanging over this record of the past\u201d. Garner said it was nerve-wracking to contact many of the people represented in the work, One Day I\u2019ll Remember This (out now through Text), to explain that she was publishing passages about them, albeit de-identified. \u201cI was quite surprised by how many of the people I contacted [said] \u2018Go ahead, I trust you\u2019 \u2013 which was an astonishing thing to say under the circumstances.\u201d The response from readers to Garner\u2019s first volume of diaries, Yellow Notebook, published this time last year, also galvanised and surprised her. It was \u201cthrilling\u201d to find out she \u201cwas fully a member of the human race\u201d, she said, because writers sometimes get a sense \u201cthat there\u2019s something awful about you and that you\u2019ve got this terrible eye that looks at people and won\u2019t not see\u201d. Throwing forward to volume three \u2013 which she hopes to start work on in 2021 \u2013 Garner mentioned they would likely look at her discovery of the courts as a subject matter for her writing, a discovery that led to her books Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation (2004) and This House Of Grief (2014). \u201cA court and a hospital and a morgue: they\u2019re places of extreme seriousness where human existence is being dealt with within a very firm, agreed-upon structure,\u201d Garner said. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous privilege to be able to go to those places and be free to observe and use what\u2019s happening there.\u201d She also harked back to her experience of the public outcry to her breakout non-fiction book, The First Stone, which interrogated allegations of a sexual assault on campus. \u201cFeminism came like a bombshell into my life in the early 70s and enabled all sorts of things for me. It\u2019s been a liberating force in my life and I\u2019ll always be grateful for that,\u201d Garner said. But she said feminism, like all movements, \u201ccalcified\u201d, although some of the backlash she experienced from feminists after the publication of The First Stone blindsided her. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite expect the mean-spirited, spitefulness of a lot of it, I was shocked by that,\u201d she said. The experience of that response, and of others\u2019 rejection of her from the feminist movement, was also freeing, as it meant she was no longer beholden to anyone. \u201cNow I can say whatever I want to \u2013 and that was quite exciting and wonderful actually,\u201d she said. Garner spoke movingly of her different relationships with her father \u2013 with whom she fought regularly \u2013 and mother, and of believing that she would be able to better get to know her mother when her father died. Then her mother died first. \u201cI\u2019d give anything if she could walk in here now and I could be sweet to her,\u201d she said. Garner said she regretted the lack of kindness she showed her mother \u2013 especially since after her mother had died, she developed a very positive relationship with her father. \u201cI get appalled at examples of my selfishness, what I see as my selfishness here, from back then.\u201d There was hope, however: \u201cIt\u2019s not too late, if you discover regret in a useful way before you\u2019re on your deathbed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
