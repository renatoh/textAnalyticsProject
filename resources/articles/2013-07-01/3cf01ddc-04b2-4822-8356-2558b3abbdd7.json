To be fair, this land's most famous wine, Penfolds Grange 2008 did walk away with the prize for top shiraz, with Penfolds also taking the gong for for winery of the year and best cabernet sauvignon. But for once let\u2019s not dwell on the big red with the bigger reputation, and focus instead on the elegant, understated usurper. It seems the best thing you could be drinking right now is a pinot noir from Gippsland. It\u2019s not the most obvious grape/region combination. But it does highlight a point often overlooked by domestic drinkers: some of our most spellbinding wines hail from the cooler climes of Victoria and Tasmania, where this variety is thriving. Of course, Bass Phillip\u2019s winning wine is no ordinary pinot. It comes with a price tag around $350 (though that\u2019s less than half the $785 RRP for the current vintage of Grange) and brings together the perfume, red-fruit purity, fresh acid, fine-grained tannin, ageing potential and, ahem, ethereality that only the finest examples can muster. Bass Phillip winemaker Phillip Jones has built an impeccable reputation since planting vines in Leongatha South in 1979, and Halliday has long been a vocal admirer. Indeed, Halliday put his money where his mouth is with pinot noir, establishing his own Coldstream Hills winery in the Yarra Valley in the mid 80s. (It has since been swallowed into the portfolio of Penfolds owner, Treasury Wine Estates.) Still, this victory offers yet more evidence of an important phenomenon. The world is stuffed with pinotphiles and Australians just don\u2019t know how good they\u2019ve got it. This year, however, the southern hemisphere\u2019s three biggest conventions for pinot worship coincide \u2013 the triennial Pinot noir NZ, biennial Mornington Peninsula international pinot noir celebration, and annual Stonier international pinot noir tasting \u2013 with writers and winemakers heaping more praise on local wines. Meanwhile, a blind tasting of Aussie pinot has judges swooning over their spittoons. In the August edition of UK magazine Decanter, all 81 wines were commended, with 19 judged \u201coutstanding\u201d or \u201chighly recommended\u201d. Velvety, silky, elegant, beguiling, gorgeous, graceful \u2013 the tasting notes were peppered with such effusive adjectives. The irony is that almost half of those top-scoring wines aren\u2019t even available in Britain. The Poms have a right to whinge about that \u2013 but what of the ungrateful Aussies, who have access to all these great bottles and leave them on the shelf? Admittedly, there\u2019s a bit of a pinot premium. Most decent entry-level wines come in above $20, with reserve-quality normally kicking in around $50. But one can\u2019t help feeling that there\u2019s a lingering perception of pinot as a wussy grape, one for wine geeks who\u2019d wither at the merest whiff of a ball-tearing shiraz. This, Australia\u2019s signature red grape, made up a quarter of the total Australian crush in 2013. Pinot noir, though up on last year\u2019s effort, accounted for just 2%. As Andrew Jefford, one of the smitten Decanter tasters, commented: \u201cEveryone thinks of Australia as the country where you get big reds. Ironically, for me, pinot noir is more successful than shiraz right now.\u201d Optimistically, perhaps, he went on: \u201cIt can\u2019t be long before the world wakes up to the great value offered by Victorian and Tasmanian pinot noir.\u201d But what about Australians? Perhaps the sound of James Halliday banging the drum for Bass Phillip will be enough to raise us from our slumber."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
