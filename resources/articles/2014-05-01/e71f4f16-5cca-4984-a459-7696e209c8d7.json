They are the latest in a series of such incidents that has embarrassed the government. Charlie Casey, 22, escaped from Sudbury open prison in Derbyshire last month, where he was serving four years for robbery and false representation. Police have now revealed they believe he went on to attack a 24-year-old woman in St Leonards, Dorset, on Wednesday evening. The victim, from Wales, suffered a non-life-threatening injury. Dorset police said they believed Casey had been in the Binfield and Slough areas, to the west of London. But officers said they thought he had now moved on to Gwent, in Wales and urged the public not to approach him. He is described as white, 6ft 1in and of average build. He has short, dark brown hair and blue eyes and has an Irish accent. In a separate case, Paul Oddysses absconded from Hollesley Bay prison in Suffolk on Saturday morning, where he was serving a life sentence for attempted robbery and robbery with a firearm. Police described him as white, of thin build, with brown hair, brown eyes and clean shaven. He also has a scar on the back of his head and tattoos on both arms. Police said he has connections in the Hertfordshire and Essex areas. Earlier this month, Michael Wheatley, known as the \"Skullcracker\", absconded from Standford Hill prison on the Isle of Sheppey while serving 13 life sentences for bank raids, but was recaptured and charged with carrying out another attempted armed robbery. Two other prisoners, Damien Burns and Dean Jackson, absconded on Tuesday. Burns was serving an indeterminate sentence for a knifepoint robbery, while Jackson was on remand awaiting a sentence for a theft-related offence. Conservative backbencher Philip Davies has criticised the decision to relax security over the prisoner as \"disgraceful.\" He said: \"It is completely ludicrous that a serving life sentence prisoner is even in an open prison where they can simply walk out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
