Dishing out portfolios is not science nor is it usually sensitive personnel management; but the appointments announced yesterday do seem to be of a piece. Ministers who proved they could do a competent job (Margaret Hodge, Barbara Roche) have been given another go, some promoted, others shifted. Tradition has been upheld by the naming of an attorney general, Peter Goldsmith, no one has heard of; and defied by the arrival of a solicitor general, Harriet Harman, with political nous and energy. You would not normally use the word Prussian of Tony Blair - though it might fit his neighbour in Number 11 -but there is something dour and Roundhead about the emerging shape of the government. It is the quality which made Alun Michael so bad in the Welsh context but potentially so useful in a department. For a government which has staked its fortunes on \"delivery\", yesterday's list felt about right. That is not all. With Peter Hain's return, the powers that be have evidently decided a firework or two are needed to light up the Westminster sky. Junior ministers are all guys and gals for the policies of the top brass. For some backwater departmental jobs are a passport to even denser obscurity. Others flare and yet others climb, usually thanks to their performance in the real testbed of modern politics, encounters with editors and media presenters. Some of yesterday's casualties are going to thrive back on the backbenches - Chris Mullin will probably be a better servant of the public interest as a select committee member than a lowly factotum in the Department of Environment. As for Keith and Kate: the Europe minister long ago became a distraction and Ms Hoey's departure in company with her secretary of state allows a symbolic fresh start with Wembley. On the backbenches she can take up cudgels - stirrups? - on behalf of the foxhunters. Jeff Rooker has many of the qualities needed to make a success of the difficult asylum brief, notably humanity and administrative competence. But this is no job for an unelected member of an unelected chamber. The Chris Mullins of the new parliament - let us fervently hope more Labour MPs will join him in constructive criticism - deserve a minister in situ. So do the seekers after asylum and all those who will be striving might and main to ensure their treatment is generous and fair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
