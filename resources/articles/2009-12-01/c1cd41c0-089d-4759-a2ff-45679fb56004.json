Of course not! My personal rule is that, as the lights dim, the audience is allowed to conclude any discussions quickly in the faintest whisper. Then silence. But it's complicated. We'd all agree that it's OK to respond to what is happening on the screen by crying or laughing. Angie Errigo, of Empire magazine, was sitting next to me once during a horror film. At one scary moment, she actually shouted: \"Oh, No!\" Angie is in a noble tradition. The New Yorker's legendary Pauline Kael would often get carried away during thrillers, crying out, \"Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!\" at increasing volume. In press screenings, wisecracks are always acceptable. One film, I remember, was produced by a US company with a classy, British-sounding name: Hyde Park Entertainment. When their logo flashed up \u2013 bafflingly featuring London's Tower Bridge, which is miles from Hyde Park \u2013 the Daily Mail's Chris Tookey remarked acidly: \"Yes, well, that doesn't inspire confidence!\" Much giggling ensued. At the end of one dire day of screenings, we critics once sat down to a horrible tear-jerker called Mrs Caldicot's Cabbage War. Pauline Collins played a lonely widow who is pathetically grateful to be given a nice lunch in a restaurant. She simpered: \"I haven't had many afternoons like this.\" \"We have!\" remarked the Observer's Philip French drily. On another occasion, in Michael Mann's gangster drama Public Enemies, we critics were subjected to a grim jail scene that showing prisoners being beaten in the exercise yard. From behind me came the unmistakable voice of Johnny Vaughan: \"Ahhh \u2013 this takes me back!\" I don't always approve of backtalking, though. In Paul Weitz's comedy American Dreamz, Dennis Quaid plays a US president who, to his advisers' horror, goes all wobbly and liberal. He opens a copy of the Guardian and, entranced, says: \"There's so much interesting stuff in here.\" The Star's Alan Frank called out: \"He hasn't got to Bradshaw's bit yet.\" Alan was rewarded, I am sorry to say, with a huge laugh. For goodness sake. Sssshhhhh!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
