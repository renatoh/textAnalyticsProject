Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t. God, this show is artfully made. The first episode was explosive and romantic and beautiful to look at, attaching itself like a limpet mine to your hull of a nervous system. The second took a subtler tack. For all its violence, and while it still looked lovely, this week\u2019s instalment was a stowaway, an anxious exercise in accumulation, and the steady, sinister method by which Pine went about insinuating himself into Roper\u2019s affections. Is he there yet? Is Roper seduced by a fellow psychopath or suspicious that he\u2019s a psycho-plant? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t suppose he does, either. And I\u2019m certain Pine doesn\u2019t. \u201cThere\u2019s half a psychopath in there,\u201d Burr told him, when geeing her new asset up for his transformation; as he set himself to the task of becoming a convincingly remorseless thug, you wondered whether the other half was clicking into place as well. The traumatically handsome Tom Hiddleston If there\u2019s something a bit cliched about the spy as lost soul, hero unmoored from conventional morality by What They Make You Give, Tom Hiddleston\u2019s performance of it is entirely fresh. He\u2019ll make a great Bond some day, if he wants. (Sometimes this feels like an audition piece.) Last week\u2019s public school charmer is much less in evidence this time around, but it\u2019s not that you feel he\u2019s just playing a different part. Instead, as Pine mutes his conscience, it\u2019s as if a teacher\u2019s left the room. It helps that Hiddleston is so traumatically handsome, with the kind of face that\u2019s bound to leave you off balance at the best of times, let alone when he\u2019s winding an extension cord around a small-time Devonian drug dealer\u2019s neck. His manners have been so impeccable up until now that the change feels like a betrayal \u2013 and all the more thrilling for that. The chillier his behaviour, the more we identify with him: because his violence has a seductive edge, and because we enjoy it, we feel complicit in the compromise he\u2019s making, and hence fully signed up to the confrontation with Roper that undoubtedly lies ahead, strapped to the same bomb. Mallorca, Devon, Zermatt It\u2019s not just Hiddleston\u2019s performance that puts us off balance: the story drags us from location to location, repeatedly dropping us into situations where we\u2019re not quite sure who\u2019s playing who or for what. In the opening set piece we watch Roper\u2019s girlfriend, Jed, do a lot of languorous showering and lingerie-fiddling, then talking to her mother, who evidently hates her, about someone called Billy, who is presumably her son, and who apparently doesn\u2019t ask about her any more. Her mother says, uncharmingly, that she is \u201cnothing but a dirty whore\u201d; Jed takes a load of pills then heads out to play the perfect surrogate mother to Roper\u2019s son, Danny. Danny is on screen as source of contrast and vulnerability, but he\u2019s also Chekhov\u2019s gun, and from the moment he appears he makes us uneasy, because at some point he\u2019s obviously going to go off. But as Jed danced adorably with him in the seaside restaurant, I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for it to happen so abruptly. And then, just as we think the boy\u2019s going to be disappeared, we see Pine\u2019s glassy eye through a hole in a door; and then we turn on a sixpence and head six months backwards to Zermatt. It\u2019s a disorienting opening, and by the same token utterly compelling. Pine, we learn, is hiding behind that door because the kidnapping is a set-up, a choreographed chance for him to play the hero and ingratiate himself with Roper and his cohorts. His trip to Devon is mandated by Burr, who sends him there to acquire the criminal identity he will need if Roper is ever going to believe in him. (\u201cThere\u2019s not a scrap of you that won\u2019t be used,\u201d says Burr, \u201cthere\u2019s not an hour that you won\u2019t be scared, but you will nail him.\u201d) Sometimes this sojourn veers into the parodic \u2013 there\u2019s a great bit where he showers under a waterfall, and he single-handedly transforms his dilapidated cottage into a backdrop for a Cath Kidston catalogue in no time at all. There\u2019s nothing terribly original about the wide-eyed lass who falls for him, either, although she\u2019s well played by Hannah Steele. (I look forward to television\u2019s first ever west country girl who isn\u2019t pale, dissatisfied and secretly randy for a posh boy.) Still, the chapter serves its purpose, and soon Pine is ready for his trip into the lion\u2019s den \u2013 both in terms of his backstory and because of his rapid reacquaintance with the violence that shaped his first career. His insertion into Camp Roper is, honestly, a little ridiculous too. Roper is a supervillain with hyper-paranoid instincts and life-preservingly strong reasons to maintain them. I\u2019m not sure he would entertain the notion that a man he first met as a hotel night manager in Zermatt has coincidentally pitched up as a chef in his favourite Mallorcan restaurant and saved his son from an unrelated kidnapping. In fact, it\u2019s so daft that I wonder whether the eventual payoff will reveal that Roper knew he was a spy all along, and drew him in as part of some as yet unspecified masterplan. Hollander\u2019s sauce Whatever the truth, at least Corcoran, Roper\u2019s suavely menacing righthand man (though everyone in this show is suavely menacing, with the possible exception of Angela Burr and the kid) smells a rat. I think Tom Hollander\u2019s performance here is my favourite thing in The Night Manager. Corcoran has a fantastically specific language, a dead-eyed, sing-song pantomime of politesse that leaves you in no doubt that he would like nothing better than to cut your toes off and stick them up your nose. And Hollander manages the right balance of assurance and resentment without seeming silly: men like Pine, you suspect, weren\u2019t terribly nice to him at school. (So much of this series has made me wonder about the indignities heaped on its protagonists during their well-appointed childhoods.) \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re quite as poorly as we\u2019re making out,\u201d Corcoran tells our hero, with a menacingly menacing air of menace, as he recuperates under Roper\u2019s roof. \u201cIn fact I\u2019m not sure at all about you, Pine. I think you might be stringing us along.\u201d If this turns out to be the case, he carefully explains, \u201cI will hood you and hang you up by those lovely ankles until the truth falls out of you by gravity. Toodleoo.\u201d Roper\u2019s doubts aren\u2019t quite so violent, but he makes them known in his own scarily affable manner. \u201cYou sleep now,\u201d he says. \u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll find out who you really are.\u201d As the episode ends, Pine ponders the weight of that promise, and doesn\u2019t appear to be much looking forward to its fulfilment in the morning. We, for our part, will have to bide our time till next week to see how it goes. I can\u2019t wait. Notes and observations If Pine and Jed don\u2019t end up sleeping together I\u2019ll eat my hat. People that good-looking just don\u2019t orbit each other on television without having sex. Or not for long, anyway. I love the assortment of grey men who make up the British espionage establishment. Surely not even the one played by Neil Morrissey can be as dense as they all seem: when are they going to catch on to what Pine\u2019s doing, and what will the consequences be? There were some nice veiled resonances in Danny\u2019s reading to Pine about underwater life. \u201cDo you want me to read to you about squid?\u201d he asked, and began: \u201cthis slow-moving alien-like squid lives at depths \u2026\u201d You might apply that description equally to Roper and Pine alike. We haven\u2019t actually seen Roper do anything mean yet. All of his violence and cruelty is contained, even when his son\u2019s life is under threat. The explosion should be worth the wait. I\u2019d lay a large bet that a screengrab of Tom Hiddleston in his undercrackers will make the Daily Mail tomorrow. Aidan Turner had better look out.
