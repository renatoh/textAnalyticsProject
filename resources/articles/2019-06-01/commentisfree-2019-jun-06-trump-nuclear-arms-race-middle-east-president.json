What could go wrong?", "bodyText": "How grimly galling, as Donald Trump ostentatiously marks today\u2019s 75th anniversary of one of the world\u2019s biggest battles, that he is so ready to risk starting another one of potentially greater magnitude. What could possibly be that dangerous, you might ask. Answer: selling American nuclear knowhow to Saudi Arabia without radiation-proof guarantees that it will not be used to make atomic bombs. Belated confirmation came this week that the US department of energy has issued seven separate permits to allow transfers of nuclear technology to Riyadh. Belated, because the information was purposefully withheld until Democrats insisted on seeing it. Belated also because Trump, his family and associates are doubtless aware of suspicions that they could benefit financially from these or future sales. The fact that two licences were issued after last autumn\u2019s murder of the US-based Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, is not the worst of it. Rather than punish the Saudi regime for the killing, as decency and the facts demanded, Trump went ahead regardless. Nor is another noxious fact \u2013 that the Saudis are prosecuting a merciless war against the people of Yemen \u2013 the single most powerful reason for objecting. More terrible than any of that is the blindingly obvious danger that providing nuclear expertise to Riyadh will push Iran, their sworn enemy and regional rival, into developing its own nuclear capabilities. Supposedly the whole point of Trump\u2019s campaign of threats and sanctions is to deter Tehran from doing just that. To provoke Iran in this fashion is astonishingly stupid \u2013 and hypocritical. It is simply not good enough to say that two planned Saudi reactors, for which multibillion dollar tenders will be sought next year, are intended for civilian, not military use. So far at least, Riyadh has reportedly refused to offer standard guarantees that it will eschew uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing, two well-worn pathways to nuclear weapons, or accept independent inspections. Since it signed a UN-endorsed agreement in 2015 to curb its nuclear-related activities, Iran is said to have abided by its terms, including allowing anytime, anywhere inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Full cooperation may soon end, due to Trump\u2019s daft decision to renege on the pact. Yet the escalatory prospect of a Saudi A-bomb could propel Iran into an all-out, headlong race to arm itself. Nor is it good enough to say, like Rick Perry, Trump\u2019s energy secretary, that if Washington does not give the Saudis what they want, others will. This is a hackneyed, age-old argument used by gun-runners the world over. Perry has claimed that China and Russia do not give a \u201ctinker\u2019s damn\u201d about non-proliferation. Even if that were true, is he really suggesting that the US can or should ignore its own rules and those of the UN and nuclear allies such as Britain and France? Congressional critics suspect the White House is using one-off licence approvals to surreptitiously bypass the so-called \u201c123\u201d safeguarding process. They also point to connections between the Trump clan and the Saudis. \u201cI have serious questions about whether any decisions on nuclear transfers were made based on the Trump family\u2019s financial ties rather than the interests of the American people,\u201d said Democratic senator Tim Kaine. If all this were not enough to convince any sensible person that Trump\u2019s Saudi sale-of-the-century is a thoroughly irresponsible idea, consider this: Mohammed bin Salman, the hotheaded Saudi crown prince, vowed last year that if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, \u201cwe will follow suit as soon as possible\u201d. Since Saudi and Israeli officials maintain that Iran is already doing exactly that, the implication is clear. The burgeoning nuclear deal is of a piece with Trump\u2019s wider Saudi sycophancy and, in part, is payback for Riyadh\u2019s help in keeping world oil prices low. Another product of this toxic relationship is Trump\u2019s recent overturning of a congressional ban on conventional arms sales. The ban reflected broad concerns about Yemen but also about the autocratic regime\u2019s unsubtle interventions in Libya and Sudan, its persecution of women\u2019s rights activists, and the unresolved Khashoggi affair. Evidently, such concerns are not shared in the Oval office. Trump and the Saudis is a bad combination. Trump and nukes is even worse. At his behest, key nuclear arms control treaties, like the INF pact with Russia, have been torn up on a whim or, like New Start, will simply be allowed to lapse. As next year\u2019s review conference of the landmark 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty approaches, the US is merely offering more talks about talks, rather than a commitment to finally honour the treaty\u2019s dog-eared promise of nuclear disarmament. Trump claims he wants rid of nuclear weapons. But this is double-speak from a notoriously two-faced man. The global non-proliferation consensus is unravelling; just look at North Korea. The US, like Russia and China, is modernising its existing nuclear arsenal and seeking new weapons. Others may follow suit. And as his shady Saudi deals show, Trump would rather make a killing \u2013 no matter who gets killed. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
