You will need an approved holiday address which is acceptable to immigration at the airport. You will need no more than two nights in Male. Each of the 70-plus resorts have an office in Male and you can shop around for any specials. Be warned, though - you may end up paying more by doing it yourself rather than taking the all-inclusive package. The dhoni (boat) from Male to your resort island and then from the resort island back to the airport island can be expensive if you choose a resort too far from the airport. Bed and breakfast packages on resorts can leave you with expensive bills for meals and drinking water. The Nasandhura Palace is a tourist-type hotel on the harbour, convenient for the airport. It is relatively expensive - as is most holiday accommodation - cheaper is the Blue Diamond, en suite rooms, run by an ex-VSO with excellent food. Don't be put off by the difficulties, as the Maldives islands are really fabulous and well worth a visit.
