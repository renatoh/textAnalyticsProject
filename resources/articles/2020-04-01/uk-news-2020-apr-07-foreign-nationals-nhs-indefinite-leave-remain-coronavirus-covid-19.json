The MPs \u2013 led by the Liberal Democrats\u2019 home affairs spokesperson Christine Jardine and the shadow justice secretary, David Lammy \u2013 have written to the home secretary, Priti Patel, urging her to say that \u201cthose who have put their lives at risk for our country are welcome to live in it\u201d. They also want indefinite leave to remain to be extended to the families of foreign nationals working in the NHS. Last week, Patel announced a free-of-charge one-year extension for 2,800 foreign doctors, nurses and paramedics, whose visas are due to expire by 1 October. But the cross-party group, which includes one Conservative MP, Daniel Poulter, argue it does not go far enough. Jardine said: \u201cThousands of the doctors, nurses and support staff who work in our NHS \u2013 the people on the frontline of this crisis \u2013 are foreign nationals. Our beloved NHS could not function and lives would be lost at this difficult time without their contribution. \u201cRight across the UK we have seen people\u2019s enormous pride in the NHS and goodwill towards NHS staff. Now the government has a chance to show its own support for the people\u2019s heroes by extending the right to remain to all the foreign national NHS workers fighting for our lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cIf someone is prepared to risk their life for this country, they must be allowed to live in it. This is not just a gesture \u2013 it is our moral responsibility.\u201d Other signatories to the letter include the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, the former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron and the former Labour leadership contender Jess Phillips. The extent to which the NHS relies on migrants was underlined by the fact that the first four doctors who died from coronavirus were all born overseas. Dr Alfa Saadu, 68, Amged el-Hawrani, 55, Adil El Tayar, 64 and GP Dr Habib Zaidi, 76, had ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Before lifting its cap in 2018, the government was criticised for the refusal of visas to thousands of doctors from outside the European Economic Area, despite staff shortages in hospitals. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise and value the huge contribution which foreign NHS workers are making at this difficult time. \u201cThat is why we announced an automatic 12-month, free of charge, visa extension for NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics whose visa will expire before October, to ease the situation for them. \u201cWe are continuing to see how else we can further assist frontline NHS workers during this crisis.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
