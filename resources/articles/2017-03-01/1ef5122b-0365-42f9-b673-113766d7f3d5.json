See youse then! West Indies were unlucky that Shannon Gabriel got injured, but however you look at things, they got nowhere near enough runs. And when that happens, the fielding needs to spot-on, which it wasn\u2019t, and an attack with no part-timers is required, which there also wasn\u2019t. Root nudges to point, there\u2019s a misfield, and that\u2019s that! What a brilliant partnership this has been, 102 runs in total, with Root ending on 90 and Woakes on 68. 48th over: England 225-6 (Root 89, Woakes 68) Four dots from Holder, then Woakes spots a slower ball and humps it over the top for six - that\u2019s the hundred partnership, and the scores are level. But Holder isn\u2019t letting this go, following Woakes as he moves to leg and burning one at his body! Lovely stuff! England require 1 off 12 balls. 47th over: England 219-6 (Root 89, Woakes 62) Single to Root, then Woakes tries to lift a long-hop over the top - it sits up and pleads for maltreatment 0 but leaning back, he toe-ends it, only doe Holder to put him down at mid-off. That was very naughty indeed. England then add three more, and it\u2019s nearly time; if Root hits two sixes, is that a ton? England require 7 from 18 balls. 46th over: England 213-6 (Root 87, Woakes 58) Holder returns, and this match is now ambling to a finish; if Root can whack the runs required, he\u2019ll have a century - and he\u2019ll also have strike. England require 13 from 24 balls. 45th over: England 212-6 (Root 86, Woakes 58) Four singles from Brathwaite\u2019s over; West Indies just didn\u2019t have the bowling once the two frontline spinners were done. And even then, they missed some chances, Powell\u2019s catch and the run out in particular. England require 14 from 30 balls. 44th over: England 208-6 (Root 84, Woakes 56) Carter fractionally overpitches, so Woakes panels him through extra cover - I don\u2019t think Root has hit a boundary since he came in, nor has he needed to. On the one hand, they\u2019ve batted brilliantly; on the other, with no scoreboard pressure, it\u2019s been relatively easy for them to. England require 18 from 36 balls. 43rd over: England 202-6 (Root 83, Woakes 51) Kraigg Brathwaite continues, and Root nudges a single, then Woakes leans back and cuts the two which brings up an iron-stoned fifty. I say iron-stoned, but he only from my own pathetic perspective - he has looked amazingly calm throughout, the mortifyingly handsome, personable and talented so-and-so. He adds a single, Root does likewise, and this has been a lot of fun. England require 24 from 42 balls. 42nd over: England 197-6 (Root 81, Woakes 48) Holder opts to slow things down, introducing Carter, whom Woakes immediately runs down to third man. Root then nabs a single of his own - this has been one of the best low-key innings I\u2019ve ever seen - and a further single each takes England into the 20s. This is pretty much done. England require 29 from 48 balls. 41st over: England 193-6 (Root 79, Woakes 46) Here comes the powerplay; England take three from the over, and could probably now wear another wicket. England require 33 from 54 balls. 40th over: England 189-6 (Root 77, Woakes 44) Single to Root, then Brathwaite tries a cutter, donating far too much width - Woakes doesn\u2019t wait to be asked twice, thrashing it through point for four. This is superb behaviour from him - completely calm, rational batting, hitting that which needs to be hit, not getting out otherwise, and he\u2019s not far off guiding his team home. But then he pulls to long-on, gets through the shot too quickly, and Powell, on for Gabriel, is well-placed to snaffle! But running around the fence, he can\u2019t quite bring it in, letting it burst his hands and falling onto his fizog in the process! That might be West Indies\u2019 last chance, as they run two; this partnership is now 66, of which Woakes has scored 44. What a player he now is; why, it\u2019s almost as if the selectors know more about cricket than livebloggers! England require 37 from 60 balls. 39th over: England 180-6 (Root 75, Woakes 37) Now Kraigg Brathwaite is given a go, and Woakes has a look then lifts his third ball over midwicket for one. Root then knocks the final one to midwicket for a further single, and West Indies badly need a wicket. England require 46 from 66 balls. 38th over: England 178-6 (Root 74, Woakes 36) Carlos Brathwaite into the attack, and Root eases him to third man, before Woakes picks out the man at point when he tries a cut. But he doesn\u2019t miss out next ball! Oh yes! A pitched-up delivery doesn\u2019t have the pace to do anything but sit up to be clouted, so clouted it is, all the way over the fence! And then a slice for two makes that an excellent over for England, ten from it. England require 48 from 72 balls. 37th over: England 168-6 (Root 73, Woakes 27) Mohammed continues and England calmly take three - one to Root, two to Woakes. West Indies haven\u2019t yet run out of time, but they\u2019re not far. England require 58 from 78 balls. 36th over: England 165-6 (Root 72, Woakes 25) Holder charges in and Root pokes him to third man - Woakes isn\u2019t necessarily up for a single, but runs one anyway, and it\u2019s comfortable. But he\u2019s nearly left rueing his agreeableness - now there\u2019s a lesson for us all - when he under-edges a pull, his pads saving him from playing on. Next ball, he canes for four to midwicket, and then after they hustle a single and decide there\u2019s another run on, Lewis is left with a shot - if he hits, Woakes is done for, but he misses! England require 61 from 84 balls. 35th over: England 158-6 (Root 71, Woakes 19) After drinks - and heaven knows, I need one - Root nurdles a single to leg, then Woakes adds one down the ground. And what\u2019s this! Root tries a cut, the same shot that\u2019s got out three of his mates, but misses by the width of a bumfluff beard. He then bunts a single into the off side, and experiences relief - if West Indies can get him, that will probably be it. England require 68 from 90 balls. 34th over: England 155-6 (Root 69, Woakes 18) Woakes pulls two to square leg off Holder\u2019s second ball, and England are just easing free again, now that Bishoo and Nurse are gone. the fifth delivery sneaks past the outside edge, but then - or and then, depending on you read the situation - Woakes then wafts the next delivery just over mid-off. This is brilliantly tense stuff. England require 71 from 96 balls. 33rd over: England 151-6 (Root 69, Woakes 14) This is rapidly - ok, not rapidly, very slowly - becoming yet another innings of mature brilliance from Joe Root. He might make a player, and a captain, one day. He sensibly arranges another single, then Woakes steps down the track and launches a drive over mid-off for four. It\u2019s not so much about the runs, that, as reasserting supremacy. Though it\u2019s England who are nervous, West Indies would swap places in a second. England require 75 from 102 balls. 32nd over: England 145-6 (Root 68, Woakes 9) Root pushes down the track and hints at a run, so Holder makes to shy, then doesn\u2019t bother when he stays put. This is wonderfully tight stuff now, though we\u2019re some way from runs becoming an issue. But a pain in the midriff becomes one, when Root misses a pull and wears a stinger, bellowing a cussword in fury. He then pulls a single, the only run from the over, before Woakes narrowly avoids edging a short one and we learn than Gabriel has a sidestrain, so won\u2019t be bowling again this evening. England require 81 from 108 balls. 31st over: England 144-6 (Root 67, Woakes 9) At Nurse\u2019s end, Holder opts for the part-time spin of Jason Mohammed, perhaps hoping that England\u2019s not having faced him much will help. And really, the tension 19 overs out from the close is remarkable - we should never be allowed to forget the fun of a low-scoring ODI. Three singles from the over; both batsmen daren\u2019t get out, so we\u2019re in this for the long haul. England require 82 from 114 balls. 3oth over: England 141-6 (Root 65, Woakes 8) So, who will it be? Holder, er, goes to, er, himself. Fair dos, at least he\u2019ll know who to blame if it doesn\u2019t work out: his front line batsmen. And he\u2019s really putting his back into things, testing Root with a short one, tempting the fence before hands come inside it. One from the over. England require 85 from 120 balls. 30th over: England 141-6 (Root 65, Woakes 8) So, who will it be? Holder, er, goes to, er, himself. Fair dos, at least he\u2019ll know who to blame if it doesn\u2019t work out: his front line batsmen. And he\u2019s really putting his back into things, testing Root with a short one, tempting the fence before hands come inside it. One from the over. England require 85 from 120 balls. 29th over: England 140-6 (Root 64, Woakes 8) And this is the last of Nurse, who England nudge away - though his fourth delivery bounces big on Woakes, causing minor consternation. Nurse finishes with 3-34, and a revitalised game; well done him, and and well done Jason Holder for bowling him through and supporting him with slips. England require 86 from 126 balls. 28th over: England 136-6 (Root 62, Woakes 7) Here comes your Bishoo to bowl the final over of a telling spell, and after a single to Root, Woakes cracks him square on the off side for the first boundary in absolutely ages. Bishoo ends wih 2-43 off his ten. England require 90 from 132 balls. 27th over: England 131-6 (Root 61, Woakes 3) This is Nurse\u2019s penultimate over; Nurse Ratched, as far as England are concerned. Root shoves his first ball for one, then four dots follow before Woakes, who looks comfy, takes a single down the ground and Root does likewise to midwicket . England require 95 from 138 balls. 26th over: England 128-6 (Root 59, Woakes 2) All England need to do is not get out. Easy, right? A wide helps, then a single to Root and two to Woakes. England require 98 from 144 balls. This is great bowling, and the dancing has begun! Moeen was still thinking about the one that left him in the previous over so when one drifted in on him, he did nothing - until it rammed middle and off, at which point he picked up his bat and returned hutchwards. 25th over: England 124-5 (Root 58, Ali 3) Moeen plays for turn, none comes, and there\u2019s minor excitement as the ball goes past his edge. I wonder who\u2019ll be used when these two are done - and if Holder will try and finish this, or hold back something for the death. 24th over: England 120-5 (Root 56, Ali 1) Moeen won\u2019t have been expecting this, having been born in mere 1987. Can he persuade himself to knock the ball around, or will he thrash over the top and get himself gone? \u201cHow about that \u2018unthrillingness\u2019 in the 20th over?\u201d emails John Starbuck on behalf of the six others. \u201cApart from remarking on its awkward construction, your readers will be thinking \u2018careful what you wish for\u2019.\u201d That, was, er, a joke - in both cases. Honest. We have ourselves a ballgame! Bishoo and Nurse have done exceptionally well to first apply the breaks, then the vice, and Buttler edges a cut, Hope hanging on at the second attempt. 24th over: England 117-4 (Root 54, Buttler 0) Root pushes forward and edges Bishoo! But it\u2019s thick enough to run away for three. 23rd over: England 114-4 (Root 51, Buttler 0) Root is unmoved by the vaguely increased tension, working a single, then Nurse spins one away from Buttler. Keen to get off the mark, he then calls Root through for a single after nudging to midwicket and has to turn and fling himself back; one more step and he was toast. 22nd over: England 113-4 (Root 50, Buttler 0) So, have we ourselves a ballgame? England still have plenty of batting to come, but they also have a fair few runs left to get. They\u2019re favourites, for sure, but won\u2019t be wanting to lose any more wickets in the next bit. Stokes leans back to force a cut away, can only edge, and Hope takes a smart catch behind the wicket. 22nd over: England 113-3 (Root 50, Stokes 1) Root gets one of the least memorable fifties you\u2019ll ever see, Collingwodian in its stealthy, relentless accumulation. But then Stokes props forward to Bishoo, misses, and takes it on the pads. The ball was going down, but that\u2019s a warning. 21st over: England 112-3 (Root 49, Stokes 1) Surely West Indies now bring on Brathwaite to try and get Stokes ego before. But, in the meantime, he\u2019s off the mark second ball, then Root adds a two and a one. Pitching in-line, umpire\u2019s call on the stumps - the ball was dislodging the off-bail. Well bowled, Ashley Nurse. This one goes on with the arm, Morgan waits for the spin that didn\u2019t come, plays down the wrong line, and REVIEWS! Looks out to me... 20th over: England 108-2 (Root 46, Morgan 7) West Indies have staunched the flow of boundaries, at least; after a wide, Morgan bunts a single and Root takes three to point. Then another single, and, well, this is thrilling only in its entire unthrillingness. 19th over: England 102-2 (Root 40, Morgan 4) There just isn\u2019t very much West Indies can do about any of this. Even quiet overs are fine, and in the middle are two men with the skill and temperament to guide England through as many of them as necessary. Perhaps it might be worth bringing some pace back to get at Morgan before he\u2019s in, because there\u2019s another over exceeding the run rate, currently standing at 3.95. 18th over: England 98-2 (Root 40, Morgan 4) Bishoo twirls through, Root sweeping a brace then a guiding a single off the final two deliveries of the over. 17th over: England 92-2 (Root 32, Morgan 0) Root and Morgan knock Nurse around. Drinks. \u201c90s dance produced a lot of quality,\u201d tweets Michael Avery, \u201clike Livin Joy\u2019s \u2018Dreamer\u2019.\u201d Nothing says \u201cwalking into the club and getting the feeling\u201d quite like it. Apart from perhaps this - though it\u2019s all riff and no trousers really. 16th over: England 92-2 (Root 32, Morgan 0) Root and Morgan knock Bishoo around - I might just store that line on my clipboard. 15th over: England 87-2 (Root 32, Morgan 0) So out comes the in-form Eoin Morgan; what a sentence that is to type. As I was saying, Roy can\u2019t help but swipe at one outside off - it\u2019s a decent ball, daring him to take it on through the wind and to the long boundary - and that\u2019s a straightforward catch at wide long-on. 15th over: England 87-1 (Roy 52, Root 33) Nurse is bowling reasonably enough, but isn\u2019t looking likely to break through - instead, a tempered pull earns Roy two and his fifty. 14th over: England 83-1 (Roy 49, Root 32) Bishoo opens his third over with a wide, and then, after a dot, Roy reminds him what\u2019s what, carting a shot one to the midwicket fence. And this is the problem, I guess - you create pressure and take wickets by bowling a succession of good balls. Put that insight in your pipe and smoke it. 13th over: England 73-1 (Roy 42, Root 30) This is good from West Indies just as England were threatening to pull away. Bowling very straight, Nurse limits the batsmen to four singles - still more than the run rate. 12th over: England 73-1 (Roy 42, Root 30) Bishoo is somewhat grooved now, Root\u2019s sweep for one the only run off the over. In a way I\u2019m surprised - England won\u2019t want to let him settle - but on the other, little point getting all excited chasing such a low total. 11th over: England 72-1 (Roy 42, Root 29) Nurse into the attack for some more powerplay behaviour and this is the first tight over in sometime, just three from it. 10th over: England 69-1 (Roy 41, Root 27) Later than I expected, Holden turns to Bishoo, and Roy has a look, for one ball, before sweeping him left-handed, from outside off, to the fence at third man. Er, ok then! Perfectly normal behaviours! Elsewhere, it seems that BBC 6 Music are following the 90s riff. 9th over: England 63-1 (Roy 35, Root 27) Root takes a single, then Roy chucks everything at a pull, minding at the past second that there\u2019s a breeze going on and taking his bottom hand off the bat. Smart gear, that, and it saves him, the ball dropping short of the fielder as they run one, and then Brathwaite drops short so Root glances him to the fence. And four more arrive next ball, Root leaping onto tippy-toes to square-drive to the point fence, two more follow, and England are rinsing: 12 off this over, 13 off the previous one. 8th over: England 51-1 (Roy 34, Root 16) Holder continues and Root nabs three more to midwicket, then a single apiece brings Roy back onto strike. Ah. So he waits for one that\u2019s marginally wide of off and chleanses it to the midwicket fence, then twists the next ball to square leg, raising the 50 partnership - it\u2019s come off 31 balls. \u201cIn other news, Chris Jordan is about to become a PSL champion,\u201d emails Chris Drew. \u201cAnother for the CL team?\u201d I swither on CJ - Ceej - who is useful but unreliable. I\u2019d not have him ahead of Broad. 7th over: England 38-1 (Roy 25, Root 12) Brathwaite, CR into the attack Root turns two away towards midwicket, then charges and swipes three more - it should carry over the fence but holds up in the wind instead. Roy then turns down a single Root is certain exists, but it makes little difference - after that early wicket and scare, England look to have this squantied right down. 6th over: England 31-1 (Roy 24, Root 6) The standard of 90s pop-dance tunes really was outstanding: Haddaway, Culture Beat, Shabba (sorry, for avoidance of doubt, that was me interjecting, not listing an R&amp;B act in a pop-dance list). Anyway, back out in the middle it\u2019s techno techno techno techno as Roy powerstrokes a straight six. The control there was startling. 5th over: England 24-1 (Roy 18, Root 5) England are taking things gently, at least until Roy clumps Gabriel over fine mid-on. Is it just me, or does he have the game for Tests? And here he is, oh yes! Four more, whammed over cover. To carry on Rob\u2019s 90s revival, here\u2019s the finest album track of the period, period. Even if later album releases ruined things by removing the rap. 4th over: England 14-1 (Roy 10, Root 4) Roy runs a single down to third man, and then Root gets himself going - must be a while since he\u2019s faced seven straight dots - thanks to a wide, short one, slashed through backward point. 3rd over: England 9-1 (Roy 9, Root 0) Roy\u2019s hit on the pad off a full one, but it was going well down. Well, that\u2019s how it looked to me, the reality being somewhat closer. Either way, Roy is down the ground next ball, gliding a beautiful four. \u201cAh, pleasant! Sheer pleasantry, just to look at that,\u201d says commentary. And three more follow, though these are dicily obtained, narrowly avoiding dive de Brathwaite. He has nearly pulled off two stunners, in the process pulling off zero stunners. Ah. 2nd over: England 2-1 (Roy 2, Root 0) The certainty of the fielders was persuasive, I must say. But what can you do. Well, this is an odd one. In the absence of Snicko, Ultra Edge and Hot Spot, it\u2019s simply a case of umpire\u2019s judgement, or, more accurately, proof. And there\u2019s not enough - though I\u2019d not be surprised if the third umpire thought it was out. 2nd over: England 1-1 (Roy 1, Root 0) Roy absolutely marmalises a wide one from Holder, and Brathwaite, at mid-on, dives like a goalkeeper, leading with his top hand, but can\u2019t quite hang on. Still, that was pretty incredible. And what\u2019s this! Holder spirits one through Roy, there\u2019s a huge appeal, the umpire says not, and immediately comes the call to review, led by Hope behind the stumps. The bat is miles from the pad, so any noise is likely to be incriminating. \u201cWhat are the thoughts around Finn\u2019s performances out there, Daniel?\u201d asks Bill Hargreaves. \u201cFor me he had the potential to be a stalwart next to Anderson and Broad had his management or development taken a different direction, possibly?\u201d I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s management, or just that to excel consistently in international sport, you need something that Finn hasn\u2019t yet located. Given that his pace isn\u2019t quite where it was, I suppose it\u2019s fair to wonder, reluctantly, if it\u2019ll ever quite happen now, but even if it doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s done some stuff. 1st over: England 1-1 (Roy 1, Root 0) That might be the series for Billings, with Hales likely to come back in for the next match. Truth is, he\u2019s probably more suited to the middle order at the moment, it\u2019s just his bad luck that the same is so of various other monsters. Anyway, Root, who was castled by Gabriel on Friday, edges going hard, and is relieved to see it bounce in front of slip - quite how it didn\u2019t carry, I really do not know. Great over. Well well well! After Roy takes a single from the first ball, a lovely delivery, full and on middle, is edged to Nurse a second slip, he parries it across to first, and that\u2019s gone! The players are preparing themselves ... can Shannon Gabriel get the early wickets Windies need? \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the upbeat talk of England winning?\u201d emails Chris Drew. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a 90s throwback day remember! We know how to lose from anywhere.\u201d Exactly - and that all begins with cheap talk. \u201cIt is, like the rest of his appearance, stolen from Tamsin Greig,\u201d says Dan Lucas of Finnsfringe, also a town in the Rhineland. Meanwhile. \u201cIn an effort to tempt fate away from soling the notion that there are any certainties in life/sport,\u201d emails Ian Copestake, \u201cWest Indies\u2019 total is only 70 short if their bowlers up their game and/or England fail to bat like chumps.\u201d I know, I know, but I\u2019m not sure either side has a Windies win in them. As for certainties, general boredom and misery is one, I suppose. It\u2019s been bothering me all day, but I am finally able to make an announcement: Steven Finn\u2019s fringe is stolen from George McFly. To ponder: are England seriously going to negotiate and at home Champions Trophy without Stuart Broad? It\u2019s very very hard to see how England don\u2019t win from here. Their batting is so strong these days that someone always turns up, and chasing such a low total, that\u2019s pretty much all it\u2019ll take. Meanwhile... Bumble reckons Windies are 70 under par - that\u2019s a damning verdict indeed. Plus, Plunkett for Woakes would barely touch the overall hunkfactor of England\u2019s attack, which has probably never been higher. Liam Plunkett, then. He\u2019s had some ill luck to find himself only playing limited overs gear - he had a fairly decent summer in 2014, then got injured at a bad time and hasn\u2019t had a sniff since. I wonder if he might be more use on flat tracks than Woakes. Ta Rob, and well bowled England, who\u2019ve put themselves in position here. We\u2019ve said that before! That\u2019s a really good effort from England, who need 226 to win the match and series. It should be a doddle. Daniel Harris will be here for the England run-chase. Bye! Jos Buttler ends the innings with a superb run out, hitting the stumps direct with the non-striker Gabriel well short. 48th over: West Indies 221-9 (Bishoo 0, Gabriel 1) Plunkett now has figures of seven for 72 in this short series. Plunkett gets his third wicket, zipping one through Nurse\u2019s expansive drive to hit the stumps. This has been a pretty efficient bowling performance. 47th over: West Indies 220-8 (Nurse 9, Bishoo 0) The almost absent-minded nonchalance of Roy\u2019s throw to Billings showed just how normal that type of one-two dismissal is nowadays. WHAT IS GOING ON OUT THERE? Brathwaite smashes Rashid towards wide long-on, where Roy and Billings combine superbly to take the catch. Roy caught the ball inside the rope and then, as he was falling over the rope, threw it nonchalantly to Billings. 46th over: West Indies 218-7 (C Brathwaite 23, Nurse! 7) The new bowler Plunkett drifts onto the pad of Nurse, who flicks him around the corner and wide of short fine leg for four. It\u2019s a scruffy over, with a couple of wides as well. West Indies are sneaking towards a workable score. 45th over: West Indies 207-7 (C Brathwaite 22, Nurse 0) Brathwaite, who is playing well now, crashes Rashid down the ground for four. Holder slog-sweeps Rashid miles in the air, and when the ball eventually comes down Rashid takes a very well-judged catch. 44th over: West Indies 199-6 (Holder 13, C Brathwaite 14) Brathwaite gives us a reminder of his power, hustling Woakes through midwicket for four with little more than a short-arm jab. Eight from the over. 43rd over: West Indies 191-6 (Holder 12, C Brathwaite 8) A good over from Rashid costs just four singles. West Indies are really struggling now. 42nd over: West Indies 187-6 (Holder 10, C Brathwaite 6) With Brathwaite at the crease I\u2019m surprised Stokes hasn\u2019t asked to bowl, or at the very least threatened to kill Eoin Morgan with his bare hands if he doesn\u2019t give him the ball. For now Woakes continues to Holder and Brathwaite, two huge men who can hit the ball a long way, but at the moment can barely get it off the square. Woakes has terrific figures of 7-1-18-0. 41st over: West Indies 182-6 (Holder 7, C Brathwaite 5) Rashid is back and has a big appeal for LBW against Holder turned down. Morgan decides to review. The only issue is whether Holder actually connected with his attempted lap sweep. The umpire thought so; replays suggested otherwise. But Holder survives because the point of contact with the top of the stumps was umpire\u2019s call. The England balcony are not impressed. 40th over: West Indies 176-6 (Holder 4, C Brathwaite 2) Woakes, not Stokes, returns to the attack to bowl at Carlos Brathwaite. His batting form has been surprisingly poor since he marmalised Stokes in the final of the World T20, and in that over he is rapped painfully on the glove by Woakes. West Indies probably need at least a run a ball from the last 10 overs to make this competitive. 39th over: West Indies 173-6 (Holder 3, C Brathwaite 0) That was the last ball of the over. Carlos Brathwaite is the new batsman. Carter the stoppable six machine. He tried to blast Plunkett over mid-on, a bit of a premature stroke, and sliced it high to Rashid at mid-off. It was a lively innings of 39 from 36 balls but now West Indies are in the ill-smelling stuff. 38th over: West Indies 171-5 (Carter 39, Holder 2) Moeen bowls his last over, and Carter bids him farewell with a big six over long-on. Shot! Moeen ends with decent figures of 10-0-44-1. 37th over: West Indies 163-5 (Carter 32, Holder 1) \u201cIn another 90s throwback,\u201d says Chris Drew, \u201cwe now have Carter the Unstoppable Six Machine at the crease!\u201d Plunkett strikes with the second ball of a new spell. It was a nothing delivery really, drifting onto leg stump, but Mohammed lifted it gently to Rashid at mid-on. 36th over: West Indies 158-4 (Mohammed 50, Carter 28) The lively Carter hustles Moeen for four more through midwicket. As on Friday, he has given the innings considerable impetus; he has 28 from 25 balls. 35th over: West Indies 149-4 (Mohammed 50, Carter 19) Ach, apologies; we\u2019ve been having a few technical problems. West Indies have started to get a move on: seven runs from Finn\u2019s over and now 13 from the returning Stokes\u2019s. Six of those came from one thumping pull stroke by Mohammed that took him to his second half-century in three days. That\u2019s a particularly good effort given that, before Friday, he has played two ODIs (across five-and-a-bit years) and scored six runs. 34th over: West Indies 136-4 (Mohammed 43, Carter 14) 33rd over: West Indies 130-4 (Mohammed 41, Carter 10) Carter gets his first boundary, rifling a half-volley from Finn back down the ground. Stokes, meanwhile, is back on the field; apparently he has just jarred a finger. 32nd over: West Indies 123-4 (Mohammed 41, Carter 3) Excellent stuff from Moeen, who keeps Carter to a single from the over and now has figures of 7-0-21-1. 31st over: West Indies 122-4 (Mohammed 41, Carter 2) Finn has troubled every batsman with the short ball today. That includes the new batsman Carter, who gets a leading edge that loops safely wide of backward point for a single. Finn\u2019s performance in this series will probably get him into the Champions Trophy squad, though there is a lot competition for the seam-bowling places. \u201cIf that\u2019s your seam attack (and I\u2019ve no problem with it), what\u2019s you batting line-up?\u201d says Chris Drew. \u201cAny changes from here?\u201d Probably just Hales for Billings, though I would definitely have Billings in the squad as he is such an impressive utility batsman. Hales\u2019 experience and capacity to score 150 give him the edge though. 30th over: West Indies 120-4 (Mohammed 40, Carter 1) \u201cStokes has just dropped the IPL,\u201d sniffs Ian Copestake. Brathwaite\u2019s work is done. He walks straight past a big-spinning delivery from Moeen and is stumped by a mile. 29th over: West Indies 117-3 (K Brathwaite 42, Mohammed 38) Finn replaces the relatively expensive Rashid (5-0-33-0) - and he has Brathwaite dropped off his fifth ball. It was a relatively simple chance for Stokes, running back from midwicket when Brathwaite mistimed a pull, but his positioning was poor and it burst through his hands. He injured himself in the process and is leaving the field. It looks like he has damaged the middle finger on his right hand. It\u2019s almost surreal to see him put down a chance like that. 28th over: West Indies 113-3 (K Brathwaite 40, Mohammed 36) Mohammed is into his work now. After four dots from Moeen he slaughters him back over his head for another boundary. The rain seems to have cleared so we should be okay to go straight through the 50 over.s. 27th over: West Indies 109-3 (K Brathwaite 40, Mohammed 32) Mohammed gets down on one knee to swipe Rashid over midwicket for the first six of the innings. That was a cracking shot. It\u2019s raining fairly heavily now, though play is continuing for now. 26th over: West Indies 100-3 (K Brathwaite 39, Mohammed 24) Mohammed scrunches Moeen to long off for a single to bring up the hundred. It\u2019s been a good recovery from the West Indies, though Moeen is quietly doing an economical job: 4-0-13-0. 25th over: West Indies 98-3 (K Brathwaite 38, Mohammed 23) Brathwaite gives Rashid the charge, gets nowhere near the pitch and decided to mow him towards cow corner for a single. That\u2019s one of five runs in the over - runs being the operative word in this partnership, as only eight of the 52 have come in boundaries. 24th over: West Indies 93-3 (K Brathwaite 35, Mohammed 21) 23rd over: West Indies 91-3 (K Brathwaite 34, Mohammed 20) Brathwaite heaves Rashid towards cow corner for a couple off the last ball of an over that brings five runs. \u201cI attended the Active Bradford Sports awards on Thursday, my primary school was nominated for an award, and was disappointed that Rashid (who was also up for an award) wasn\u2019t there,\u201d says Tom Van der Gucht. \u201cAt the time I had a similar attitude to Andrew Gale (when Rashid declined to play for Yorkshire at the end of the season) but hearing him in action now, I\u2019m can almost understand why he was unable to make it.\u201d Look, in the 21st century there\u2019s no excuse. For anything. 22nd over: West Indies 86-3 (K Brathwaite 31, Mohammed 18) It\u2019s pretty gloomy in Antigua, and the groundstaff are getting ready just in case. Two from Moeen\u2019s over. West Indies have rotated the strike a lot better in the last few overs; on this pitch you\u2019d expect with the lowest dot-ball ratio to win the match. 21st over: West Indies 84-3 (K Brathwaite 29, Mohammed 17) Brathwaite pumps Rashid down the ground for four. It wasn\u2019t a perfect stroke but he got enough on it to clear mid-on. Rashid\u2019s reply is excellent, an even slower legspinner that growls past the edge. 20th over: West Indies 76-3 (K Brathwaite 24, Mohammed 16) Moeen Ali comes into the attack in place of Stokes. The bowling changes have been pretty mechanical so far but that\u2019s fine; this pitch doesn\u2019t really need funky captaincy. Seven from the over, all in ones and twos. This is good batting. Now, assuming everyone is fit, what would be your seam attack for the first game of the Champions Trophy? I\u2019d probably go with Woakes, Willey, Wood and Stokes. 19th over: West Indies 69-3 (K Brathwaite 21, Mohammed 12) Adil Rashid is coming on to replace Liam Plunkett (4-1-11-0). His first over is on the malodorous side, with two wides in the first four balls and then a full toss. He improves towards the end, mind you, and there are six runs from the over. 18th over: West Indies 63-3 (K Brathwaite 19, Mohammed 10) Stokes is worked around for six in that over, four singles and a two. I have no idea what else to say. 17th over: West Indies 57-3 (K Brathwaite 15, Mohammed 8) A maiden from Plunkett, and that\u2019s drinks. \u201cOh!\u201d says Chris Drew. \u201c1990s link. That would be this.\u201d As a supporter of Kent, runners-up in three trophies that season, I can say only one thing: you mothereffing effing effer. 16th over: West Indies 57-3 (K Brathwaite 15, Mohammed 8) It\u2019s fair to say England are on top, but this score isn\u2019t a disaster for West Indies given the nature of the pitch. If they can beg, steal and borrow their way to 250, they will have a chance. 15th over: West Indies 52-3 (K Brathwaite 13, Mohammed 5) Mohammed opens the face to glide Plunkett through the vacant slip area for four. Actually there was a bit of edge in that and, as Sir Robert Key says on Sky, it\u2019s unusual for Morgan not to have a slip in when the opposition are 47 for three. 14th over: West Indies 47-3 (K Brathwaite 13, Mohammed 0) \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Chris Drew. \u201cJust over one month to the potentially promotion deciding clash: Northamptonshire v Glamorgan. Proper cricket is on its way back!\u201d Yes, but what\u2019s that got to do with the 1990s? Ben Stokes makes things happen, part 31204101863. It wasn\u2019t a great delivery, short and wide, but it got the wicket. Hope threw his hands at the ball and bottom-edged to Jos Buttler. Any golden-armed all-rounder would have been proud of that wicket. 13th over: West Indies 45-2 (K Brathwaite 12, Hope 16) Plunkett hurries through another over, one from it. England have bowled very straight today. 12th over: West Indies 44-2 (K Brathwaite 11, Hope 16) It\u2019s time for Ben Stokes, who didn\u2019t bowl in the first ODI. His first over is adequate and brings four low-risk runs. It\u2019s all a bit low-key at the moment. 11th over: West Indies 40-2 (K Brathwaite 10, Hope 13) Liam Plunkett replaces Steven Finn. Five from the over. No, no I wasn\u2019t paying attention. 10th over: West Indies 35-2 (K Brathwaite 9, Hope 9) Chris Woakes has proved tens of thousands of people wrong by becoming an England regular. I wonder if he\u2019s proved his own subconscious wrong as well. Either way he looks the part now, certainly in one-day cricket. The moment I type that, he drops short and is muscled through midwicket for four by Brathwaite. Commentator\u2019s curse?!?!?!?! 9th over: West Indies 31-2 (K Brathwaite 5, Hope 9) Hope turns Finn just short of Despair at square leg. Later in the over, Finn drops short and is scorched through the off side for a fine boundary. \u201cI miss Neil Fairbrother, Rob,\u201d weeps Guy Hornsby. \u201cAlmost as much as I miss Graeme Thorpe. Artists at forging an innings, but the former with so much unfulfilled international promise. He could\u2019ve been a superstar. It\u2019s great to see that skill hasn\u2019t totally evaporated in these thick-batted, slow-bouncer times. Morgan &amp; Billings grafted on Friday, and we\u2019ll need that again today. All these 90s touchstones, it just makes me want to listen to Different Class. There\u2019s a Stokes riff in there somewhere.\u201d On that note, what the hell will Channel 5 do in the year 2036, when it\u2019s time for them to make I Love 2016? 8th over: West Indies 23-2 (K Brathwaite 5, Hope 1) Brathwaite slaps Woakes just wide of the jack-knifing Root at gully. It would have been a superhuman catch. The new batsman Hope then inside-edges just short of Buttler. This really isn\u2019t an easy pitch. It\u2019s two-paced - slow and slower - and not at all conducive to strokeplay. \u201cYou know things are bad,\u201d says David Horn, \u201cwhen English cricket in the 90s is providing you with comfort.\u201d 7th over: West Indies 21-2 (K Brathwaite 4, Hope 0) Every milestone in Steven Finn\u2019s career is worth celebrating, given all he has been through and will probably continue to go through. He\u2019s such a likeable, admirable bloke, with a spirit that is paradoxically fragile yet unbreakable. Only Darren Gough and Stuart Broad have got to 100 ODI wickets for England in fewer matches than Finn\u2019s 67. \u201cWas intrigued to read of an \u2018insinuation of swing\u2019 earlier,\u201d says Brian Withington \u201cAny chance of a \u2018semblance of seam\u2019 too?\u201d I always thought it was an innuendo of seam? Steven Finn gets his 100th ODI wicket. Powell tried to pull a short ball that was too wide for the stroke, and it lobbed straight up in the air for Finn to take a simple catch. 6th over: West Indies 21-1 (K Brathwaite 4, Powell 9) Chris Woakes has quietly become the leader of England\u2019s seam attack in ODI cricket, and he has started superbly here. He is bowling very straight and just short of a length, making him hard to get away on this tacky pitch. His figures are 3-1-4-0. 5th over: West Indies 19-1 (K Brathwaite 3, Powell 8) After five dot balls, Powell punches Finn classically through mid-off for four. That stroke notwithstanding, this looks a difficult pitch to score on. Funny that, as it\u2019s the same pitch that was awkward to score on the other day and now it\u2019s even more tired. Identifying what is a decent score will be so important for the West Indies; even something as low as 240 might be enough, though they\u2019ll probably want nearer 270. 4th over: West Indies 15-1 (K Brathwaite 3, Powell 4) Brathwaite is dropped by Morgan off Woakes at mid-on. It was a brilliant attempt. He dived high to his left, extended a telescopic left arm to reach the ball... but couldn\u2019t hang on. A maiden from Woakes. \u201cScrolling through on my phone and coming across that Neil Fairbrother video, I knew right away who was doing the OBO today!\u201d says David Horn. \u201cYour 90s nostalgia gives you away. But what a player he was. England\u2019s first ODI specialist. The spiritual Godfather of Morgan and Buttler. I remember watching him once against Surrey and the way he moved his feet was quite incredible. He seemed perpetually on the move.\u201d Yes, in some ways he\u2019s the forgotten genius of England\u2019s one-day cricket. Also, it\u2019s not nostalgia, it\u2019s pragmatism. The alternative is living in the present. Bugger that! 3rd over: West Indies 15-1 (K Brathwaite 3, Powell 4) Powell is quickly off the mark, forcing Finn through point for four. \u201cDear rob.smyth,\u201d writes Odell. \u201cWe are looking for employees working remotely. My name is Odell, I am the personnel manager of a large International company. Most of the work you can do from home, that is, at a distance. Salary is $2700-$5800.\u201d Well that\u2019ll be me then. Bye! Lewis has gone! He tried to turn Finn to leg and got a leading edge towards short cover, where Billings took a smart catch diving forward. It looked like the ball stopped in the wicket a bit, and that\u2019s likely to be an issue all day on this used pitch. 2nd over: West Indies 11-0 (K Brathwaite 3, Lewis 8) Chris Woakes will open the defence from the Sir Andy Roberts End. There\u2019s an insinuation of swing to the right-handed Brathwaite, no more than that, but his line is good and there are just two from the over. 1st over: West Indies 9-0 (K Brathwaite 1, Lewis 8) It used to be the bowlers who opened the attack. These days it\u2019s the batsmen, and in this case Evin Lewis. He slams his first two balls, from Steven Finn, through the offside for four to get the West Indies off to a flyer. The Joy of One, England v West Indies in ODIs Neil Fairbrother\u2019s magical innings at Lord\u2019s in 1991, one of the more bittersweet hundreds scored by an England player in the 1990s. In other news, there is a belting Test match going on in Bangalore. England need to improve a fair bit if they are to compete in the Ashes next winter. West Indies K Brathwaite, Lewis, Powell, Hope (wk), Mohammed, Carter, Holder (c), C Brathwaite, Bishoo, Nurse, Gabriel. England Roy, Billings, Root, Morgan (c), Buttler (wk), Stokes, Moeen, Woakes, Rashid, Plunkett, Finn. They are unchanged, as are England. Next! Good afternoon. The pitches in the West Indies bear approximately 0.00 per cent resemblance to those in England. In that sense, a series win here would have very little significance when England attempt to win this summer\u2019s Champions Trophy. But confidence, individual and collective, is something you can take all round the globe. Maurice Mentum has the world\u2019s most powerful passport. In that sense a victory would be valuable, especially if it involves individual success for key players like Eoin Morgan and the type of nuanced batting performance that shows England have more than one way to skin a bowling attack. They will need another such performance today, as we are playing on the same wicket that was used for the first ODI. I say \u2018we\u2019; I\u2019m not putting on my pads, I haven\u2019t taken guard on middle stump, Dude. An England win would seal the series with a game to spare. It wouldn\u2019t suddenly make them odds-on favourites for the Champions Trophy, but it certainly wouldn\u2019t do any harm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
