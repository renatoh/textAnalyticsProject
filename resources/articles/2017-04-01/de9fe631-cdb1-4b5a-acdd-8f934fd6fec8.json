Humanz, the first album by the band since 2011\u2019s The Fall, is due out on 28 April and features guest vocals from a range of artists, including Grace Jones, De La Soul, Carly Simon and Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man. Albarn, the Gorillaz frontman who is also lead singer in Blur, told Q magazine he had asked everyone working on the album to think about Trump\u2019s inauguration as they prepared to record. \u201cThe three tenets for this record were pain, joy, urgency,\u201d he said. \u201cI told everyone to imagine you\u2019re in America after the inauguration and it\u2019s the worst-case scenario: how would you feel that night? Let\u2019s make a party record about the world going fucking nuts.\u201d The first track to be released, Hallelujah Money, has been interpreted as being an anti-Trump song, with a title that celebrates lucre and lyrics that refer to building walls. The video showed Benjamin Clementine, the guest vocalist and 2015 Mercury prizewinner, performing in front of an ornate gold elevator. Jamie Hewlett, the comic book artist who creates the \u201cvirtual\u201d band\u2019s distinctive visuals and animations, has sought to downplay the album as overtly political commentary, saying it was \u201cnot a statement about Trump\u201d. Instead, he said, Humanz reflects on the \u201cworld in which he could get elected\u201d. In the Q interview, Albarn and Hewlett described how they fell out after collaborating intensively for a decade. Hewlett withdrew from Albarn\u2019s opera about an Elizabethan polymath Doctor Dee to move to Paris with his wife, the French actress Emma de Caunes. Hewlett said he wanted to escape after the pair \u201clocked horns\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019d lived in each other\u2019s pockets for 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cDamon\u2019s an artist. He\u2019s one of the few real artists that I know, but that means you can be a little crazy and a little difficult and I can be the same.\u201d Albarn said they had healed the rift. \u201cHe basically left and I felt upset by that. There was a fallow period in our relationship. \u201cI get the sense that sometimes people like getting off my steamroller and doing their own thing for a while and then joining me further down the road.\u201d Gorillaz will host their own festival, Demon Dayz, in Margate in June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
