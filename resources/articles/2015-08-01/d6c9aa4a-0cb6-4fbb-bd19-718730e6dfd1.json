In dramatic scenes caught on camera, about 30 passersby are seen lifting the taxi, a white version of a traditional black cab, to free the woman, whose leg and pelvis were pinned under a wheel. Laura Fares, an Argentinian who has lived in London for 18 years, witnessed the incident. She said \u201cEnglish politeness\u201d meant that initially no one helped the woman after the taxi hit her, on King William Street near the Bank of England. Fares, 37, said: \u201cThere were two paramedics and she had a pillow under her head. The cab driver was actually leaning on the cab with his phone in his hand just waiting. \u201cI could see she was blinking. She had a friend with her, who was hysterical. I heard her friend say she was crying. I thought: \u2018She is still alive and no one is doing anything.\u2019 There were people just watching and taking photos.\u201d Fares asked one of the paramedics if it would be safe to move the cab and when they agreed she started shouting for help. \u201cI went for it,\u201d she said. \u201cI got really bossy. I started shouting: \u2018Hey everybody, we have to push this car now. Hurry, she is dying.\u2019 In 60 seconds we had 30 people lifting the car.\u201d A London Ambulance spokeswoman said: \u201cWe were called at 1.10pm to King William Street to reports of a road traffic collision. We sent a number of resources to the scene including an ambulance crew and London\u2019s air ambulance trauma team by car. \u201cWe treated a woman reported to be in her 40s for leg and pelvic injuries. She was taken as a priority to hospital.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
