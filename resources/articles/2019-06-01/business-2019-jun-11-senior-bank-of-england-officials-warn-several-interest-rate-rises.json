The deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, said the Bank\u2019s health check on the UK economy in early May showed it warranted higher interest rates than financial markets currently expect. He said there was no reason to alter the Bank\u2019s outlook when its monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, meets next week. Broadbent backed comments made by the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, and Michael Saunders, a former City analyst who is an external member of the nine-strong MPC. Haldane said the time was nearing for a rate rise to nip inflation pressure in the bud, while Saunders said Brexit uncertainty was not a reason to delay rate rises. Broadbent told a parliamentary committee: \u201cWere the economy to develop in line with our projection ... interest rates would probably have to rise by a little more than what was in the curve at the time of the forecast.\u201d He told MPs financial market investors disagreed with the Bank\u2019s outlook, but he was untroubled by this given the deep uncertainty about Brexit that could change the outlook significantly. The Bank\u2019s forecasts assume Britain will avoid an abrupt departure from the EU. However, the benign forecast was challenged by another MPC member, Gertjan Vlieghe, at an event in London. \u201cThe news since May I think has been ... a little disappointing and in terms of both the global downside risks and the domestic downside risks my read is that they have both intensified,\u201d he said. The World Bank has forecast a slowdown in trade and a collapse in investment spending will push down global GDP growth to 2.6% this year, \u201cbefore inching up to 2.7% in 2020\u201d. Investors expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times this year in response to a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy. Vlieghe\u2019s comments are likely to be supported by other committee members including the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney. The MPC is expected to hold interest rates at 0.75% at its meeting on 20 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
