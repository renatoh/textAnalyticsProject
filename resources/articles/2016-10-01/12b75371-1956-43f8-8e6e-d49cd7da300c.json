Earlier this year, online giant Amazon opened its first physical store in Seattle\u2019s University Village, YouTube opened its first \u2018Creator Store\u2019 in London and popular online menswear store Bonobos opened 10 stores this year. At the same time, traditional businesses are scrambling to build out their online presence. In Australia, several established brands have substantially amped up their digital presence, including book retailer Dymocks and leading supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths, while major Australian banks have also invested heavily in growing their online channels as new digital models disrupt their long-held market dominance. Lee Hawksley, Senior VP and GM of Salesforce Marketing Cloud JAPAC, said the bricks-and-mortar store is still the most important point of contact for any business that has one. And it might surprise many to learn that online sales globally account for just 10 percent of all consumer buying, with the proportion more like seven percent in Australia. Yet with online trade set to continue growing its share of the bigger pie, the hybrid retail model is emerging as the gold standard for delivering a truly great customer-centric experience that keeps people coming back. \u201cThere is an expectation retailers will know exactly who a customer is at every contact point, be that in physical stores, or online at any time and via any device,\u201d Hawksley says. \u201cCustomers want experiences that are relevant and frictionless.\u201d Pure online players now have new and promising opportunities to build more personalised and meaningful relationships with their customers. They also have the advantage of having amassed rich reservoirs of customer data to further hone their messages and deliver more targeted and responsive communications in-store. Meanwhile, traditional businesses are looking outwards to entirely new markets and new customers. Tapping into digital channels, including social media, also opens doors to establish new connections and collect market data to then feed back into improving both online and in-store experiences. Known as the \u2018unified customer experience\u2019, this strategy is centred around being able to identify the customer and access important data about them at every interaction, via any channel. In its essence, offering a unified customer experience means breaking down silos and harnessing data to ensure that each and every customer has a consistent experience across every touch point they have with a business. This means more than just ensuring all communications with customers have the same tone and style. It also means using data about a customer\u2019s demographics, preferences and order history to tailor their customer experience, regardless of whether their transaction is happening in the physical world or online. And online means wherever the customer happens to be. Salesforce\u2019s Empowered Shoppers Report found very high levels of smartphone ownership among Australian shoppers, at 78 percent of Baby Boomers, 89 percent of Gen Xers and 98 percent of Millennials. It also found 33 percent of shoppers saw the inability of merchants to support mobile interactions as reason enough to switch brands. And that proportion is only going to get larger as mobile devices assume a greater role in our lives. Meanwhile, in-store interactive touch screens, either on fixed digital kiosks or portable tablets, are becoming more commonplace, especially in retail. Tablets are being used to help retail customers find the right fit. For instance, some retailers are experimenting with 3D body scanners that collect and process large numbers of data points to create precise images. Then there are applications being used by grocery stores whereby tablets attached to shopping carts detect RFID (radio frequency identification) tags on products, triggering messages such as recipes related to a particular food item. Digital screens are also being integrated with technologies like QR codes, or near-field communication (NFC) for immediate access to information. Smartphone-coded tags let shoppers scan a coded tag on an item of clothing with a smartphone, then use the device to select colour and size, which then triggers an automated system to send the item directly to the customers\u2019 change room. Retailers in the US are also experimenting with digitally connected interactive hangers. With this technology, the simple act of a shopper picking a hanger off the rack can trigger preprogrammed visual media on nearby screens, or change the lighting and background music in a store. Augmented and virtual reality technologies are also looming large on the horizon. Both have potential to let customers view different products, colours and sizes from multiple perspectives and with information overlayed, while potentially sharing that information with friends \u2013 or colleagues \u2013 via social media. Combined, these trends mean that old fears about digital retailing supplanting bricks and mortar stores are misplaced. Rather than developing independently, the two spheres are beginning to trace a similar arc, en route to delivering unified customer experiences. For how this trajectory plays out, take Nordstrom, one of the oldest retailers in the US. The upscale fashion chain has been long-renowned for the peerless customer service at its stores but has also begun taking its customer cues from online as well. Nordstrom is one of the most followed brands on Pinterest, and has used that following to bring a more cohesive link between the digital and physical for its customers. For instance, each week Nordstrom staff will analyse which items from their online store are getting the most interactions, and add these to their main Pinterest board. They\u2019ll also use Pinterest data to inform everything their stock-ordering and marketing decisions. But the link goes further than that, as Nordstrom has also begun bring Pinterest to life in its stores. With the aid of a specially developed app, in-store salespeople are able to get an instant look at what products are trending most strongly, and attach signs telling customers what items are the \u2018Top Pinned\u2019 ones and ensuring they are prominently displayed. Through initiatives like this, Nordstrom has helped ensure effortless transitions between the digital and physical world for its customers. That\u2019s the goal for business looking to thrive astride both spheres. Neither needs to be competition for the other; instead, each can open up new opportunities to better understand and delight customers.
