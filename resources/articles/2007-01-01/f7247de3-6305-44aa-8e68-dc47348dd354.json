Do you have any suggestions for an organic pesticide? Currant blister aphid damage is characterised by a distinctive puckering of the leaves. Blister aphids overwinter on the bark of trees, so are good candidates for a winter tree wash. The gruesome tar oil washes that used to be employed are no longer available, but they have been replaced by an organic alternative: Growing Success Winter Tree Wash (\u00a321.98 for two 500ml bottles, from Green Gardener, 01603 715096, greengardener.co.uk) is based on plant oils and dissolves eggs with which it comes into contact. It must be applied while the tree is dormant or new growth will be harmed, so carry out one wash now and another in February. It doesn't have the persistence of the old washes, however, so application must be thorough. Do it out on a calm day to prevent damage to nearby plants. We have a large pear tree that produces a bumper crop each year, but the tree is too big to pick them, so the garden is covered in hundreds of rotting pears. We took some to the tip, and the car is now full of fruit flies. Any suggestions? You can compost them, but you'll need to mix in lots of drier material to prevent them turning into a gloopy, stinking mush - add screwed-up newspaper and chipped garden waste. There aren't so many fruit flies around at this time of year, but covering the whole heap in a layer of garden soil will keep them at bay at any time. There must be someone who'd be prepared to pick the pears and take them away for fruit juice or chutney-making next year. Contact your local WI and see if they know of anyone, or advertise in your local post office. You might also contact an arboriculturist about reducing the size of the tree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
