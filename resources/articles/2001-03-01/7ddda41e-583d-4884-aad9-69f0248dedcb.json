He was shown a second yellow card for unveiling a vest bearing the name of his sick 15-month-old son when Second Division Wycombe scored a late winner. He left the pitch in tears. The good news for him, though, is that he will be available for the club's historic semi-final against Liverpool. The FA have applied the letter of the law in dealing with the midfielder. Saturday's red card brought an automatic one-match ban, but as he had already been sent off this season that was extended to two. Brown's first yellow card at Leicester also took him up to 10 cautions, which means a further two-match ban. \"I don't want this to overshadow what we achieved in the match,\" Brown said yesterday. \"The referee made a decison and he's got to live by it. It's there in the referees' handbook that it's a mandatory yellow card so I'll just take it on the chin, serve my suspension and look forward to the semi-final.\" The FA are awaiting the referee's report before deciding what action to take against the Wycombe manager Lawrie Sanchez who was sent from the dug-out for protesting after he felt his side should have been awarded a penalty. Leicester's goalscorer on Saturday, Muzzy Izzet, will be out for at least a month with a torn calf muscle, but a scan on Robbie Savage's knee, damaged in the same game, has revealed only bruising. Preston have completed the signing of the Leicester striker Richard Cresswell on a month's loan. Only the formality of agreement by the Football League stands between Hull City and financial security after Adam Pearson resigned from his job as commercial director of Leeds United to reveal himself as the club's saviour. Under a deal agreed yesterday with the club's administrators Pearson will become the sole owner of the club, which came within hours of a winding-up order in February. \"I am committed to turning this club around and making it a success,\" Pearson said. \"I want to give the people of Hull something to be proud of. The immediate task is to stop the club haemorrhaging money, but there will be limited funds made available to the manager for new players.\" Pearson has promised that the players, who have not received their wages for two months, will be paid in full."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
