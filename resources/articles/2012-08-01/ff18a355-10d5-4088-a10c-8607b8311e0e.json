But it is a fragile construction. Its health depends on a degree of modesty that can be a challenge for some of the over-the-top characters who make sport so exciting. And while there is no doubt that winning does a lot for team spirit, it is also true that team spirit fosters winning. The difficult calculation the ECB faced over cricket's mightiest ego, Kevin Pietersen, on Sunday was whether the man most likely to contribute to victory in the final Test against South Africa \u2013 which starts later this week \u2013 was also the man who'd been sabotaging team spirit by allegedly texting the opposition with derogatory remarks about his own side. Anything less than victory at Lord's will see England demoted from its treasured world number one status. The selectors, in dropping Pietersen \u2013 man of the match in the last Test \u2013 put the team first. Good call."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
