In one of the biggest profit collapses witnessed in the City in recent times the supermarket group said it would now make annual profits of \u00a31.4bn, compared with the already lowered \u00a31.9bn figure pencilled in by City analysts at the end of the summer, when it admitted it was losing an escalating supermarket price war to discount rivals Aldi and Lidl. Last year Tesco banked profits of \u00a33.3bn. On his 100th day as the group\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis was unapologetic about the profits slump saying he had not used the \u201cartificial\u201d tricks relied on by previous executives to paint a rosier picture. \u201cThere are a number of levers I could pull if I wanted to make a short-term profit,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt is a deliberate decision by me and the executive team that we don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Lewis said Tesco would not be making a swath of shopfloor staff redundant after Christmas \u2013 as it has done in previous years \u2013 as he is keen to improve service: \u201cCertain activities help you manage profits, but can have a detrimental impact on how you serve customers,\u201d he said. Tuesday\u2019s bad news wiped another \u00a31bn off Tesco\u2019s stock market value. Tesco has lost half its value in the past year and its huge UK chain, which accounts for nearly 30% of the UK grocery market, is now thought to be loss-making. Lewis was parachuted in from consumer goods giant Unilever to lead a major overhaul of the business, which is struggling to compete as shoppers defect to cheaper rivals and turn their backs on the big out-of-town supermarkets. Lewis insisted he could see a \u201cclear way out\u201d of the mire but his confidence did little to soothe investors. Shares fell by 17% in early trading to touch a 14\u2013year low \u2013 but later recovered to close down more than 6% at 174.9p. The new profit warning increased the likelihood of the company\u2019s credit rating being cut to \u201cjunk\u201d \u2013 a blow that would make it more expensive for the company to borrow money. The scale of the collapse in profits means Britain\u2019s biggest retailer is far from out of the woods. It is the fifth time this year Tesco has signalled lower profits on the horizon. The dire trading performance of its shops was compounded by the autumn accounting scandal that exposed murky dealings with suppliers. One shareholder said the uncertainty made its shares suitable only for the \u201cvery brave\u201d. Lewis is promising to shed more light on his plans \u2013 amid rumours of a cash call on investors or a fire-sale of businesses to reduce debts \u2013 when he updates the City on Christmas trading in January. He said Tesco had now cracked down on rogue behaviour, with all 960 staff involved in supplier negotiations retrained in sessions led by Lewis. The new approach, he said, would see the retailer seek to make a profit on the products it actually sells rather than behind the scenes manoeuvring with suppliers to secure payments for placing their products in prominent spots in the store or rebates for hitting previously agreed sales targets. The changes to its supplier dealings accounted for about the third of the shortfall in profits with the remainder spread across a series of initiatives designed to staunch the rate of customer defections. The retailer has taken on 6,000 more staff since mid-October and as part of the customer charm offensive its top 400 stores will have a Christmas greeter to usher in customers and staff on hand to help them pack their shopping at the checkout. \u201cOur new commercial approach will underpin stronger long-term relationships with our suppliers whilst at the same time ensuring that revenue recognition is transparent and appropriate,\u201d Lewis said, although he later admitted it was not opting out of the previous system altogether. \u201cWe are not walking away from rebates, but what we are doing is sitting down with all our suppliers and looking at what may be a better way of structuring the relationship.\u201d Instead of pushing the button on price cuts, as many analysts had envisaged, Lewis has made smaller changes, such as making sure its 1,000 bestselling products are in stock and cutting checkout queues. Asked how long he thought it would take to turn around the business, Lewis said: \u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball to know how fast customers will respond.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
