We saw some books that were interesting, but that failed on the quality of writing test,\" he added. The clutch of history books longlisted for the \u00a320,000 prize includes Michael Burleigh's account of the demise of the British empire, Small Wars, Far Away Places, and William Dalrymple's The Return of a King, a history of the first Anglo-Afghan war, of which Diana Athill wrote that \"the seductive artistry of Dalrymple's narrative gift draws the reader into events that are sometimes almost unbearable, but his account is so perceptive and so warmly humane that one is never tempted to break away\". Charlotte Higgins, the Guardian's chief arts writer, appears for her \"mesmerising\" travelogue of Britain's Roman history, Under Another Sky. Heavyweight political biographies include Margaret Thatcher by Charles Moore, the first of two official Thatcher biographies, of which Andrew Rawnsley wrote that \"he mines his sources skilfully without becoming their captive\"; and Disraeli by Douglas Hurd and Edward Young. \"Although Douglas Hurd is a Tory magnifico and his collaborator, Edward Young, served as David Cameron's speechwriter, their book is far from a hagiography of their party's idol. Their explanations of who Disraeli was, what he thought and wanted, how he operated, and whether his achievements and influence endured, are unflattering,\" the Guardian review noted. \"The fact that all these book festivals flourish testifies to the fact that there are still plenty of readers of serious non-fiction. We are looking for books that would push the reader out of their particular comfort zone,\" Rees said. More than 150 books were contenders, most submitted by publishers and a small number called in by the judges who along with Rees are classicist Mary Beard, Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, historian Peter Hennessy, and writer and non-fiction reviewer James McConnachie. Writing on the Samuel Johnson prize website about the challenges of judging a book prize, Beard said the judges were grappling with such questions as \"where does non-fiction end \u2026 and something else (fiction/'literature') begin?\" She added: \"Gender comes in too, of course. It's impossible not to reflect whether there are (with some obvious and notable exceptions) different male and female styles in non-fiction, and whether it is the male style that seems to tick more of the 'prize-winner boxes'. Before anyone gets worried, let me say that all us judges are on the look out for this \u2013 and we have tried to be gender-aware.\" The Samuel Johnson prize is awarded on 4 November and is worth \u00a320,000. It is open to books in the areas of current affairs, history, politics, science, sport, travel, biography, autobiography and the arts, published in English by writers of any nationality. A shortlist will be announced in October. Last year, the winner was Into the Silence, Wade Davis's account of British assaults on Mount Everest during the 1920s.
