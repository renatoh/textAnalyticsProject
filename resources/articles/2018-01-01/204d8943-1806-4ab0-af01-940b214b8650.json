Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side had appeared unable to kill off Derby County, as towards the close Marcus Rashford crashed the ball off the right post, Lukaku\u2019s header hit the left, and Paul Pogba missed a sitter. Yet Lingard\u2019s swerving long-range shot showed them how to do it and so United move on content. Of Lingard, whose season tally is now 11, the manager said: \u201cHe is in a clear evolution. He\u2019s comfortable in the position he plays, improving with the progressive style of the team, which makes him feel even more like a fish in the water. He\u2019s the opposite of Marcus because Marcus scores unbelievable goals in training and missed unbelievable chances in games. I\u2019m not worried with Marcus because his good moment will arrive. Jesse won\u2019t lose his stability. He\u2019s mature, he understands the game better.\u201d Mourinho made five changes, drafting in Sergio Romero, Daley Blind, Chris Smalling, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Rashford. Gary Rowett\u2019s XI showed six different personnel from their previous match, the 1-1 draw with Sheffield United, with Tom Lawrence, Andre Wisdom, Alex Pearce, Sam Winnall, Marcus Olsson and George Thorne all selected. United made a crisp start. Luke Shaw and Pogba moved the ball along the left. The Frenchman beat a Derby defender and switched possession to Lingard, who should have scored, instead lifting the shot over Scott Carson\u2019s goal. Yet following a flurry of United chances, the visitors stroked the ball around. Lawrence, the No10 in Rowett\u2019s 4-2-3-1, broke up the middle and reversed play to Winnall but the centre-forward was stymied. The contest had an attractive flow. Lingard and Mkhitaryan put Rashford in and after a trick to create space the striker missed a glaring chance to open the scoring. Mata\u2019s free-kick was saved well by Carson to his right and from the ensuing corner United found themselves back-pedalling. Mkhitaryan took this short and suddenly Shaw was passing back towards the centre-circle. When the ball found its way to Johnny Russell he coasted down the left and found Martin Olsson\u2019s head, the left-back forcing Romero to tip over. As the half-hour approached United became sloppy. Mkhitaryan gifted possession to Derby, Winnall raced forward and the Armenian was fortunate to see the attack fizzle out. The same was true of United\u2019s initial momentum: their display had flattened and they were now vulnerable. The lack of ruthlessness Mourinho can bemoan was evident when a Rashford glancing header from Mkhitaryan\u2019s ball hit Carson\u2019s left post. The No19 was at close range so had no excuse for missing. It was a repeat story when Mata picked him out and he could only head straight at the keeper. As the interval neared United kept pressing. A Pogba free-kick drew \u201coohs\u201d from the home support as Carson saved sharply to his right. Yet at the break the tie remained deadlocked. Mourinho believed a change was required so Lukaku, who missed the win at Everton due to a head injury, replaced Mkhitaryan for the second half. The Belgian took his customary No9 berth, Rashford moved left and Lingard went in behind Lukaku. Derby, though, made the brighter start. A Lawrence free-kick from the right found Tom Huddlestone who was unlucky not to score with a shot. From here United mounted a first attack of the period. Pogba and Lukaku combined and when the latter lost the ball he quickly claimed it back. Up stepped Herrera whose attempt was deflected for a corner. This enlivened United. Pogba dug a route into Derby\u2019s area and when the ball arrived at Mata\u2019s feet he pulled the trigger and Carson beat the ball away. The passage reflected United\u2019s dominance at the start of the contest. A Rashford corner from the left found Lukaku\u2019s head but he could not direct it and the same player\u2019s cross moments later was missed completely by Mata\u2019s head. All of this illustrated a troubling lack of requisite quality in the danger area and when Lawrence fired at Romero, who dived to his right, this was as accomplished as anything United had produced. Mourinho\u2019s men quickened the tempo yet a hint of desperation remained. Rowett brought on Matej Vydra for Winnall and Derby\u2019s manager may have seen a credible replay move into sight. But Lukaku\u2019s second confirmed victory and a potential warm weather break in Dubai. According to Mourinho, this rests on Stoke City not drawing with Coventry City in their tie as United are due to face them on Monday week. If the Potters do have a replay then United\u2019s league meeting with Mark Hughes\u2019s side is moved to Saturday week and may curtail or even mean there is no trip."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
