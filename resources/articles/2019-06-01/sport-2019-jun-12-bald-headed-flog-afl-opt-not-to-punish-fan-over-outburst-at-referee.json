Fan behaviour at games has been in the spotlight recently after what appears to have been heavy-handed responses to incidents that barely would have rated a mention in the past. A Richmond supporter was slapped with a three-game ban by the club after he allegedly called an umpire a \u2018green maggot\u2019. A Collingwood fan was spoken to by Victoria Police at the MCG on Monday for barracking too loudly, leading the AFL Fans Association to write to the league seeking clarification about what is and isn\u2019t acceptable behaviour by supporters. AFLFA president Gerry Eeman said that the incidents showed that the goalposts appeared to have shifted when it comes to fan behaviour this season, a claim the AFL denied on Wednesday. \u201cThe theatre of match day is one of the great sporting experiences, a place to be expressive and passionate about your team and the game, it always has been, it always will be,\u201d the AFL said. But the league reiterated its zero tolerance policy regarding vilification, with stadium management and police around the country to take action against any person who levels abuse at anyone on the grounds of race, religion, gender, disability or sexuality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
