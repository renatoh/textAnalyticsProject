A first-half goal from Geoff Horsfield, his second in two games since completing a \u00a31m move from Birmingham, was sufficient to enable Paul Jewell's attractive, attacking ensemble to leapfrog West Brom. Judging by the ultra-enthusiastic nature of the reception he received from his new public, \"The Horse\" is poised to become a cult hero in these parts. \"Geoff Horsfield has at times been unfairly maligned,\" Gary Megson, West Brom's manager, reflected afterwards. \"He's a good player and one we tried to buy. He's very difficult to handle and was the difference between the teams tonight.\" It seemed an accurate summary because West Brom are difficult to undo. Indeed, if Megson were a snooker player safety shots would be his forte. West Brom's manager may have been set on seeing his side record a seventh successive win in all competitions last night but his modus operandi remained punctuated by characteristic caution. Accordingly, the visitors fielded a 3-5-1-1 formation which often looked more like 5-4-1 as they defended typically deep with Artim Sakiri, Macedonia's captain and good pal of David Beckham, filling the withdrawn striking role behind Rob Hulse. Jewell played for Bradford in the days when Megson was a coach at Valley Parade and he claims that West Brom's manager not only salvaged his career but taught him more about football than anyone else. Not that Jewell has exactly turned into a carbon copy of his mentor. A 4-4-2 man, Wigan's boss loves wingers \u00e0 la Andy Liddell, encourages ambitious passing and imbues his teams with a slightly gung-ho streak. Here, though, Wigan initially struggled to get behind that West Brom backline. On a rare first-half occasion when they managed it, Horsfield forced Russell Hoult into the sort of save which endorsed suggestions that the visiting goalkeeper has been unfortunate not to win at least one England cap. Gradually feeling his way into the game, Horsfield began conjuring space and only a last-minute block from Larus Sigurdsson prevented him from testing Hoult from 10 yards as the home side strove for a fourth consecutive First Division victory. Despite sporadically menacing on the break, West Brom's principal threat came from dead balls, with Jason Koumas's inswinging corners tending to provoke panic in the Wigan defence. Indeed, when John Filan could merely parry one such Koumas delivery only Tony Dinning's desperate clearance off the line prevented a goal. Aware they had experienced a lucky reprieve, Wigan responded by very nearly scoring, Nathan Ellington creating a clever opening for Horsfield whose air shot did it no justice at all before Dinning blasted wildly over the bar. No matter. With the interval fast approaching Horsfield did significantly better, timing his run impeccably to meet Ian Breckin's looping header and dodging Thomas Gaardsoe before beating Hoult with a powerful right-foot shot dispatched from just inside the area. Increasingly anxious, Megson withdrew Hulse, introducing Danny Dichio, and, evidently still dissatisfied, made a further switch five minutes later, summoning Joost Volmer off and sending Andy Johnson on. With Johnson going into midfield, Sean Gregan, one of the better visiting performers, dropped back to fill Volmer's defensive role. Johnson very nearly equalised, his swerving, opportunistic, 25-yard shot prompting a fine save from Filan, who appeared to see it late. Had it not been for Hoult, however, Wigan would surely have doubled their advantage thanks to a first-time shot from an unmarked Lee McCulloch which the keeper did extremely well to parry before diverting Jimmy Bullard's follow-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
