Nobody doubts his set-piece ability, however \u2013 it\u2019s his contribution in open play that remains a concern. Having struggled as Liverpool\u2019s sole deep-lying midfielder in defeats by Aston Villa and West Ham, Gerrard had a different task against Everton. Brendan Rodgers changed his formation from a 4-4-2 diamond to 4-2-3-1, allowing Gerrard to play alongside the more mobile Jordan Henderson, crucial in a frantic derby played at great speed. Importantly, this meant Gerrard performed slightly higher up the pitch. Whereas Gabriel Agbonlahor and Stewart Downing had nullified him with ease, Everton\u2019s Steven Naismith found it much more difficult, despite being a very disciplined, intelligent player. Gerrard had more freedom to switch positions with Henderson and found pockets of space to receive short passes from the centre-backs, before playing good balls into attack. \u201cI\u2019ll agree with the constructive criticism,\u201d Gerrard said after the game. \u201cI\u2019ve been stifled in a couple of games when people have followed me around and I haven\u2019t been able to shake them off.\u201d Rodgers had specifically devised training-ground drills to encourage Gerrard to find space away from his marker, something that doesn\u2019t come naturally to attack-minded midfielders shifted into a deeper role. \u201cWhat I said to him was to take [the man-marking] as huge credit,\u201d Rodgers explained. \u201cI said to him, \u2018All the things you\u2019ve done in your life and career, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve been man-marked before and now you arrive at 34 years of age in a different position, and people are finding your game so influential that they\u2019re man-marking you.\u2019 So we\u2019d done some work in the week, to help him find spaces to come in and find the ball and he worked that very well against Everton.\u201d Statistics suggest Gerrard\u2019s influence in possession was minimal, however. Although his pass completion rate of 91% confirms he used the ball reliably, six team-mates played more passes. Only the right-back Javier Manquillo, of Liverpool\u2019s outfielders who completed 90 minutes, touched the ball less. Gerrard was fortunate, too, that Everton lacked their usual counterattacking threat. Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s side are generally extremely efficient at converting defence into attack smoothly but here they lacked quality in this respect, with both Ross Barkley and Steven Pienaar unavailable. Instead, Mart\u00ednez played three cautious central midfielders, which meant there was a yawning gap between midfield and attack \u2013 a problem the Everton midfielders attempted to solve with hopeful diagonal balls towards right-sided forward Romelu Lukaku, rather than through purposeful dribbling. Therefore, Gerrard wasn\u2019t forced to halt dangerous counterattacks with crucial tackles, which remains the major question mark about his suitability in that defensive midfield role. Scoring free-kicks is a useful attribute but it doesn\u2019t disguise the fact Gerrard is a predominantly attack-minded player unaccustomed to a defensive position. One attempted challenge on Lukaku summed up his uncomfortableness in the role \u2013 he showed Lukaku inside, on to his stronger left foot. \u201cHe has the performances left in him, it\u2019s just managing him through the games,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cHe has quality, great appetite, which is important, and for that he will continue to play. It is a case of how long he sees himself being able to play because he can still play for a few years.\u201d Gerrard remains an important player for Liverpool, especially considering Rodgers isn\u2019t blessed with great options in central midfield. However, while Rodgers\u2019 tactical decisions last year were based around Daniel Sturridge and Luis Su\u00e1rez, and positioning the attackers where they could wreak the most havoc, now Rodgers is thinking more about where Gerrard won\u2019t be nullified. For the first time since Gerrard broke into Liverpool\u2019s first team, he\u2019s not a guaranteed starter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
