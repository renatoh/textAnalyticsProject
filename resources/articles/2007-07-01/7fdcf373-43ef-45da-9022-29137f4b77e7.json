It can make you warm and charming, bitter and resentful, all at once. In your letter you tell me that you've just joined a workplace where most of your colleagues come from rich backgrounds, and that this makes you uncomfortable. Well, I highly recommend being one of those people such as Dolly Parton, who embrace the dirt under their fingernails, flip that blue collar right up and let all the haves know how a real person lives and behaves. Remember that in the wider world there are far more of us than there are of them, and that alone is empowering. What you also have to remember is that, in some ways, your background is an advantage. For instance, a friend of mine grew up with parents who gave her every little thing, and, while she's fantastic, she's also a lot less independent than those of us from a poor background. (I may have a bit of money at the moment, but I know that I only have me to depend on when it runs out.) There is something to be said for people who have to work hard, be creative, produce what they have with little - or no - means. Those of us from poor homes have the advantage of thinking for ourselves and of knowing that when times get hard, things could always be worse. When I am made fun of in the press I just remember those days when I'd come home to find that the water had been turned off because my mother couldn't afford the bill. Suddenly, everything feels easier. Remember, even if you're never completely at home with the silver spoons, feeling comfortable with who you are is what matters most. Once you've mastered that you should be able to have more fun with the culture clash - I had an amazing moment recently when I was standing with the head of Sony and my crusty punk best friend. My friend was talking loudly about scabies. Keep your old friends outside work close then, and try to winkle out those people in your workplace who have a similar background to you (you might be surprised how many there actually are). That last piece of advice is really important, as I found out recently when I took my first first-class flight. I was so ready for it - my laptop was primed for the comfort of a full desk, I had my fash mags in hand and I was ready to spread out like a picnic with the best of them. We boarded first and were escorted through security - proof right there (as if you needed it) of the class system. I reclined happily in my lazyboy chair. There were nuts, champagne, good food. And space for everything! Then a bout of turbulence sent the honest-to-god silverware shaking. I am not usually afraid of flying - and the turbulence ended as fast as it had begun - but this time I was freaked out. Out of the whole first-class section, Hannah (Gossip's drummer) and I were the only women, and we were also the only ones awake - the men were still laid out like babies after warm milk. Meeting Hannah's eye, I saw the real world, right there and the reason I felt so upset hit me. I didn't wanna die with these other people! If this plane went down I didn't want what parts - if any - were found of me to be entwined with them. At that moment I missed the crying babies, the mums juggling their kids, and the tiny Twix that comes with a prepackaged meal too small to satisfy a kindergartner, in my usual section of the plane. I missed my own. \u00b7 Beth would love to answer your one-line questions or dilemmas in her fortnightly column.
