Officials, who are quietly confident that they can lure Carlo Ancelotti from Milan to succeed Guus Hiddink, have made representations to Samsung's executives in South Korea and asked that the electronics company greatly increases its financial commitment. Samsung is four years into a five-year contract and pays an annual \u00a311m to have its name on the club's kits. Chelsea, though, have noted that Manchester United command around \u00a322m a year for shirt sponsorship and have told Samsung that they ought to enjoy a similar arrangement. Samsung, at present, do not agree. There is a clause in the deal that effectively entitles Samsung to first refusal on renegotiation. The deadline, though, is at the end of next month and with both parties some distance apart, Chelsea could be forced on to the market, which might yet suit them. Peter Kenyon, the chief executive, has said that Chelsea not only want to be \"internationally recognised as the world's No1 football club by 2014\"\u201a but they also want to become a self-financing business by 2010. As such, a shirt sponsorship deal is crucial. Their previous agreement was worth \u00a324m over four years with the airline Emirates. The atmosphere in Milan, meanwhile, remains edgy after Silvio Berlusconi's reported comments about Ancelotti. Italy's prime minister was overheard saying that Ancelotti and his tactics were to blame for the club languishing behind Internazionale and although the manager is accustomed to the owner's outspoken nature, he would still relish a dialogue. A pre-contract that Ancelotti signed with Chelsea stated that Milan had to give their consent to his moving. Chelsea had been growing concerned as to where they stood with that to the extent that they set up a meeting earlier this week, but they now appear to be more reassured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
