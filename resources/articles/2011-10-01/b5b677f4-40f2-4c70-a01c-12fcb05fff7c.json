Dublin city council activated its emergency plan after torrential rain led to three rivers bursting their banks, causing houses and roads to become submerged. A major shopping centre at Dundrum was also evacuated after the first floor of the mall was flooded with 10cms of water. A young Irish police officer was reported missing, thought to have been swept away in floods in County Wicklow at around 7pm. The off-duty garda, aged in his 20s, had gone out to help divert traffic away from a bridge next to a river that had burst in Ballysmuttan. Police and the Coast Guard mounted a joint search operation with the help of a helicopter to search for him as emergency teams were called out to deal with flooding across the area. Local transport was also severely disrupted and the Belfast to Dublin rail link cancelled. Dublin Bus reported that several buses were flooded as they drove along a route close to the city's canals. Ferries to Dublin were also disrupted as were flights to and from the city's airport. An inflatable boat was used to rescue motorists who had become stranded in one part of the city. More than a month's rain has fallen in 24 hours according to forecasters leading to the rivers Liffey, Dodder and Tolka bursting their banks. The Irish weather service issued a further severe weather warning for large areas around Ulster and Leinster. Authorities said they were also expecting an unusually high tide on Monday night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
