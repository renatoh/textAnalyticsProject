Stakes have been (infinitesimally) raised over the weekend and United are now, apparently, in discussions with the 19-year-old, who has a release clause of \u20ac120m. Not to be outdone, City are said to have offered him a \u00a326.6m deal for the next five years. It\u2019s likely that United will be chiefly involved in this summer\u2019s other transfer banger too \u2013 whether or not Christian Eriksen leaves Tottenham. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r sees him as an ideal Paul Pogba replacement, but isn\u2019t averse to a bit of Youri Tielemans either. Meanwhile, the club have had a \u00a340m bid for Aaron Wan-Bissaka laughed out of Selhurst Park and have been told to return with nearer \u00a360m. Tottenham will spend all summer trying to drive the price of Ryan Sessegnon down from the \u00a345m Fulham want to the 45p Daniel Levy is prepared to spend. Danny Rose may or may not still be at the club at the end of it, having offered his latest statement of wholehearted commitment to Spurs. \u201cIf I\u2019m back at Tottenham next season, great, if I\u2019m not \u2013 great,\u201d he cheered. Arsenal have had to somewhat lower their transfer expectations since going awol in Baku but are still sniffing around PSG\u2019s polo-neck-wearing, chin-stroking, art-loving right-back Thomas Meunier. They\u2019re having a peek at Fiorentina midfielder Jordan Veretout as well, and as a retro nod to former manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, have their eyes on an 18-year Ligue 1 defender \u2013 in this case, St Etienne\u2019s William Saliba. They\u2019ll also have a tussle with Spurs and West Ham over Atalanta midfielder Franck Kessie, currently on loan at Milan. Banned from buying any players, Chelsea are nevertheless keen to get in on the transfer act so have been lurking outside Leverkusen to wink at Jamaica\u2019s \u00a380m man Leon Bailey. When they are not allowed to complete that transfer, they will turn their attention to Ajax\u2019s Brazilian forward David Neres, who Fifa will also not let them sign. It all means that Willian and Pedro, expected to have been sent packing this summer, will still be blundering attractively but ineffectively up each flank next season. Stoke have slapped a \u00a323m price tag on goalkeeper Jack Butland, while West Ham are sniffing around Marseille midfielder Morgan Sanson, Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic and Celta Vigo pair Maxi G\u00f3mez and Stanislav Lobotka. Finally, Newcastle and Southampton like the cut of France Under-21 striker Jean-Philippe Mateta\u2019s jib and have each offered Mainz a bundle of cash."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
