The 46-year-old, who has been running the theatre for a decade, said it was the right time, and that he was desperate to spend more time with his friends and family. \"When I came to the Lyric, people asked me why, and now they're asking me why I'm leaving,\" said Bartlett. \"Instinct told me to come here, that it was the right move for me, and now I know it's the right time in my career as an artist to move on.\" When Bartlett joined the Lyric, it was weeks away from being closed by the banks. \"I'm very proud of the fact that not only are we still here 10 years later, but we're thriving,\" he said. His final production, a new staging of Moli\u00e8re's Don Juan (which he also translated), opens on September 30. It ends a month later, and Bartlett already has several projects lined up. In October he is undertaking a new translation of Genet's The Maids for Radio 3, and then will be joining Boston's American Repertory Theater to direct Christopher Marlowe's Dido, Queen of Carthage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
