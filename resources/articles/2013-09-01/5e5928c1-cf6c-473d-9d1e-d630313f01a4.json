No problem, Small Talk, I've just got back from the gym. We might as well get straight down to business: England had a really bad Euro 2013. Do you see the upcoming World Cup qualifiers as a good chance to shake that off and get people talking about all the right things again? Yeah. We definitely need to do that. We all know that the performances in the Euros were not good enough, were not acceptable, and we need to change as a team. We need to be better. The team that goes out and plays the first World Cup qualifier needs to put on a show [England take on Belarus in Bournemouth on Saturday]. We need to prove to people that we're a good team, we can play good football and Euro 2013 was a blip. We're fighting fit and we want to make sure that we get England to the World Cup. Is it a good thing you're playing three of the first four matches at home? Yeah probably. It can be quite difficult to travel \u2013 and quite tiring, dealing with different food and different time zones, so it's probably for the best that we've got home games, so we can settle. But we'll go out there with the same intentions we always do: we want to win and get three points for the team. England were playing pretty well in the run-up to Euro 2013 and deserved to win the send-off game against Japan that finished 1-1. What was different once you got to Sweden? How come teams like Germany, Norway and Sweden were able to perform but not England? It's a great question, a question I think we've all been asking ourselves. We don't know the answer, but we need to find it out; players and staff, we all need to look at ourselves. And make sure that when we go to tournaments we prove we are worthy of being there \u2013 prove that we are a top team by getting to the final. Has it been good to have the Women's Super League to come back and focus on? I think so, yeah, it's good that you've got to focus quickly on something different. After a major tournament it does take a while to get back into the swing of things, especially if you are disappointed at not having played as well as you believe you should have or could have. I'm sure the players might struggle a bit mentally if they didn't have something straight away. It's been a nice distraction for the supporters as well: this year's title race has been terrific. Liverpool and Bristol Academy meet on the last day of the season to decide who wins [finally wrenching the trophy out of Arsenal's hands after nine consecutive titles]. Has it been strange for Arsenal to be chasing other teams? Because of being in the Champions League for years, we've always been in the situation that we have played less games than other teams so we've always played catch-up, really. We try our best and if we end up winning it, we end up winning it. Whoever is top deserves it: the league doesn't lie. Liverpool have finished bottom for the past two seasons, it's been quite a turnaround there. They've put a lot of investment in and they've got the backing of the men's team, it's fantastic. The game's changing and things are moving forward for women's football. I don't find it surprising at all that they're up there. The proof will be if they can do this consistently, obviously Arsenal have had this consistency over many, many years. Other teams need to start stepping up to that level, not just winning one year, or winning a cup one year: they need to be doing that consistently. And that will make the game stronger. It's nice to see more clubs taking their women's team seriously and to see different clubs challenging for the league title. It'd be good for that to continue. Yeah, that would be great. It's got to happen. I still believe the league needs to go fully professional. I've been lucky enough to play for Fulham [signing in 2000, when they became the first fully professional ladies team in Europe] and that for me is where the game needs to go to bring it on to the next level. The league is expanding next season to two tiers of nine teams, with Doncaster Belles relegated to make way for Manchester City and Lincoln Ladies moving 30 miles to become Notts County. How has that affected the players? For me it's sad, because as an older player I remember Donny Belles in their heyday, they were the flagship team in women's football. [But] the FA do what they believe is right for the league; I don't really know all the ins and outs of the politics of what happened, so it's hard to comment. Fair enough, let's move on to the fun stuff. What's your favourite cuisine when you're away? [Possibly regretting agreeing to speak to us] I don't know to be honest ... I like Mediterranean food, but to be honest I'll eat anything, I'm not the fussy one in the camp! For Sweden we had our own chef out there, so we had food that we usually have, but I like to experiment and have food from different places. Are there fussy people in the camp then? There are a few fussy ones, but I won't name and shame them. I'm the only one that doesn't like our pre-match meal of fish fingers, which everybody else eats. That's probably the only thing I don't like; we all have fish fingers pre-match but I can't stand them. [Small Talk wonders for a moment if fish fingers might be at the heart of England's tournament woes, imagining gigantic buns stuffed with lettuce, mayonnaise and the breaded wonders] Ahem. What's your favourite biscuit? Do you know what? I'm not really a massive biscuit fan to be honest. [Crestfallen] Are you not sweet-toothed? I like cakes, but I'm not a tea drinker so I miss out on biscuits. I'd eat it if it was in front of me, but I wouldn't go out looking for shortbread or whatever. No hot drinks at all? Hot chocolate I like. With whipped cream and marshmallows? [Almost audibly retching.] Not marshmallows. Small Talk knows a fine little eatery that tops its hot chocolate with whipped cream and crumbled Maltesers. Oh, really? OK, I might have to experiment with that, that sounds good. What's the last CD you bought? [Sounding as though we've just asked which nursery rhyme she likes to read before bed.] Jesus, you're going back a bit. Er, um, that is, what's the last album you downloaded? That's a thing, isn't it? Sorry, Small Talk is a bit behind the times. Haha, no, I'm probably worse. Alex [Scott, Yankey's England and Arsenal team-mate] is the DJ, so I just give my iPod to Alex and she loads it up for me. What kind of stuff does she put on it? R&amp;B, soul, stuff like that. Do you like music you can dance to? In the changing room everyone puts on stuff that's pumping and head banging, gets you up for the game, but I'm the one sitting there listening to love songs. What is it that warms up your tellybox, then? When I get chance, I like EastEnders although I haven't seen it for ages. I like to get back from training and whack EastEnders on and catch up with what's going on. It's an easy watch. Hmm, what else? CSI, I'm a bit of a CSI fan. Any particular location? Whatever's on, it just intrigues me. Has Small Talk uncovered a secret yearning to be a forensic scientist? [Laughing.] Maybe. I don't think I'm clever enough. Nonsense, there's a post-football career for you right there. Ah, there you go, I'm sorted, I've worked out my calling in life. Are you superstitious? I'm not sure, but maybe. People have told me about things that I didn't really realise I was doing. Like at England games, Fara [Williams, the Liverpool midfielder] told me that I always go last in the line-up, and then made me always go last in the line-up. So you'll see I'm always at the end for the national anthem and stuff, but I don't know if that's my superstition or Fara's. I'm usually the last one out of the changing room, but again, I don't know if that's a superstition or me just being lazy. What superpower would you have? Erm ... ooh, I don't know, there's too many good ones. Maybe to fly, that would be quite cool \u2013 then when I'm late I can get there quicker. Small Talk detects a theme here. Are you always late? Well, you know, I just like to take my time. People wait for Rachel Yankey. No, no, no, I'm on time, I'm just the last one. A fine distinction there. Yeah there is! Now think carefully Rachel: who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger? I think a lion. [Sensing in the silence a need for some sort of explanation] I don't know why. I just sort of chose it. I just figured it was bigger, but I ain't got a clue. I like lions ... three lions for England! That's my reasoning. Ah, there you go. That was like watching someone on Miami Ink come up with some elaborate explanation for their tattoo. Haha, yeah, that's the way my backwards mind works. In that case, dare we ask for a joke? I haven't told a joke since I was at school! I don't know. I can only think of rubbish ones like knock knock, who's there, doctor ... [Cutting in to spare England's most capped footballer before she can do too much damage to her reputation] OK, thanks very much Rachel, all the best! Cool, no problem, cheers, bye-bye. \u2022 Rachel Yankey is an athlete mentor for disadvantaged young people at the Dame Kelly Holmes Legacy Trust"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
