At a lengthy, rambling and combative briefing on Saturday afternoon, the president also sought to discredit media reports of his administration\u2019s failures and called some outlets in the White House press corps \u201cfake news\u201d. Media reports about shortages of ventilators and personal protective equipment, he claimed, relied on state governors asking for more supplies than they needed. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, by Saturday evening more than 305,000 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US, resulting in more than 8,000 deaths. New York is by far the state worst hit. Scientists around the world are looking for potential treatments but so far have not found a success. The drug repeatedly pushed by Trump, hydroxychloroquine, has only shown anecdotal promise. The drug is used to treat malaria, arthritis and lupus. Reports of its potential have driven up sales and made it difficult for Americans who rely on the drug to fill prescriptions. \u201cWhat do you have to lose? What do you have to lose?\u201d Trump said from the White House podium. \u201cTake it.\u201d He also said he \u201cmay take it\u201d himself, though he would \u201chave to ask my doctors about that\u201d. The president\u2019s own public health advisers, who stood with him in the briefing room on Saturday, have warned against taking hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19. On 24 March, for example, Dr Anthony Fauci, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease director, answered a reporter\u2019s question about whether the drug was considered a treatment for Covid-19. \u201cThe answer is no,\u201d Fauci said, \u201cand the evidence that you\u2019re talking about \u2026 is anecdotal evidence.\u201d On Saturday the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Dr Steven Hahn, said physicians could prescribe hydroxychloroquine under emergency use authorization. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to provide false hope but we definitely want to provide hope,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s urging came moments after another senior health adviser, Dr Deborah Birx, told Americans the coming weeks would be \u201cthe moment to do everything you can to keep your families and friends safe\u201d by following federal physical distancing guidelines. The White House\u2019s own projections show 100,000 Americans could be killed by the virus. On Saturday, Trump said: \u201cThere will be a lot of death\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore critical certain media outlets stop spreading false information,\u201d he said. \u201cI could name them, but it\u2019s the same ones, always the same ones.\u201d Earlier, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced his state had looked to China for ventilator supplies. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the apex,\u201d said Cuomo, who described the crescendo of cases to come as \u201cthe number one point of engagement of the enemy\u201d. Cuomo said he had obtained 1,000 ventilators from the Chinese government with the help of billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and the Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Oregon had loaned New York another 140, he said. The Trump administration has sought to redefine the national strategic stockpile as a \u201cback up\u201d for states, and avoid coordinating a response to the pandemic. On Saturday, Trump tried to claim credit for the 1,000 ventilators sent to New York by China and said, \u201ctwo very good friends of mine brought him those ventilators\u201d. In his morning press conference, Cuomo said New York had 113,704 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and a death toll of 3,565. Most deaths were in New York City, with nearly 1,000 in other parts of the state. Current projections put the peak of the pandemic in New York between four and 14 days away. Officials hope physical distancing will slow the spread of the disease and forestall the possibility of running out of ventilators and hospital beds. Cuomo admitted he hoped to see the apex soon, so the experience would soon end. The pandemic, \u201cstresses this country, this state, in a way nothing else has frankly in my lifetime\u201d, he said. Cuomo\u2019s briefing from the New York state capital, Albany, offered another contrast in leadership with the president in Washington. While Cuomo\u2019s briefings convey alarming statistics, his frank descriptions of shortages and personal struggles have been praised. On Saturday, Cuomo said the state had a signed contract for 17,000 ventilators, a deal he was later told could not be done because many had already been bought by China. As Cuomo spoke, Trump retweeted articles about hydroxychloroquine, from rightwing sources. The US federal government\u2019s response to the outbreak has been defined by bungled testing, poor coordination, low stockpiles and planning failures. Federal failure to intervene in supply chains has led to bidding wars for masks and other personal protective equipment, governors have said. The White House has repeatedly claimed it has 10,000 ventilators in the national stockpile. However, states have reported some of those ventilators are unusable, after the administration failed to ensure the stockpile was properly maintained. Trump has repeatedly caused confusion, often during hours-long press conferences. On Saturday, he also attacked his probable challenger in November, Joe Biden, and the intelligence official he fired on Friday night; insisted the US economy would soon have to \u201creopen\u201d despite expert predictions of a lengthy shutdown to deal with the virus; and defended Republican governors who have not ordered social distancing measures. Such states, he said, had \u201cbig land, few people and they\u2019re in very good shape\u201d. Trump\u2019s performance came less than 24 hours after he announced new advice from his own health department, that Americans should wear masks in public, then, even as his wife Melania tweeted out the news, said: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
