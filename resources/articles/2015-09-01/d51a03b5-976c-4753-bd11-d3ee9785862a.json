Combined with a 3-2 win for Slaven Bilic\u2019s Croatia and England\u2019s failure to qualify for Euro 2008, his decision to seek shelter beneath it represented a quick witted headline writer\u2019s dream. By the time the clock struck midnight, the soon-to-be-removed national coach had become \u201cthe Wally with the Brolly.\u201d Seven years on and now managing Newcastle, he can, finally, laugh about it \u2013 but it is safe to assume he will not be taking a rain hat, let alone an umbrella, to Upton Park for his first competitive reunion with Bilic. The intervening years have seen West Ham United\u2019s manager establish a strong rapport with McClaren, their bond formed when the Croat made a point of seeking the Yorkshireman out during a scouting trip to Wolfsburg. \u201cI tried to poison Slaven\u2019s food, I tried to trip him up,\u201d jokes the 54-year-old. \u201cNo, he was very humble and gracious. He spoke very well. We know it\u2019s sport, it\u2019s not life or death \u2013 although it nearly was for me that night! \u201cWe get on very well, we\u2019ve the same passion for football. Slaven\u2019s a good man, a good coach, a good manager \u2013 and I think a perfect fit for West Ham. He\u2019s a fantastic character. \u201cHe came over to Wolfsburg and that was the kind of kiss and make up. He\u2019s been very good to me since. He\u2019s a gentleman and a typical Croat. He\u2019s passionate about creating very good teams wherever he goes.\u201d Since that rainy Wembley evening McClaren has won the Dutch title at FC Twente as well as managing Wolfsburg, Nottingham Forest and Derby, while Bilic found life tough with Lokomotiv Moscow before winning more friends than prizes at Turkey\u2019s Besiktas. The pair are now implementing cultural change at West Ham and Newcastle, endeavouring to replace some of the long balls favoured by Sam Allardyce and Alan Pardew with a more attractive brand of passing and movement. \u201cIt [England v Croatia] seems a lifetime ago,\u201d says McClaren, who, despite still seeking his first Premier League win at Newcastle, has received a warm welcome from fans encouraged by early season performances. \u201cBut Croatia had a very good team then and they deserved to go on and qualify.\u201d Like Bilic, he has subsequently built exciting sides, most notably at Twente and Derby. \u201cI\u2019ve most definitely changed since 2007,\u201d says the man who had previously enjoyed success managing Middlesbrough. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019d be in trouble. \u201cThey say what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger and the Croatia game did nearly kill me, but I survived. It wasn\u2019t a good night. But it wasn\u2019t about Croatia or Slaven, it was about England and myself. \u201cIt was the lowest I got. But you need these things and they happen for a reason. You either slink off or try to come back with more of a determination. It was very, very easy to want to prove people wrong \u2013 although it was difficult to get a job.\u201d Bilic was appalled by McClaren\u2019s vilification. \u201cOf course I felt sympathy for Steve because I know how it works,\u201d says West Ham\u2019s manager, who could recall the newly fit former Newcastle striker Andy Carroll. \u201cWe played really well. England came back to 2-2 and then we scored again. But Steve recovered really well. He was brave enough and had enough quality to prove himself in different leagues. Now he\u2019s back in the Premier League and I\u2019m glad for him.\u201d Despite Newcastle having scored only twice in the first four Premier League games, Tyneside optimism remains intact and fans at St James\u2019 Park cheered McClaren\u2019s team off after a spirited 1-0 defeat by Arsenal shaped by Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s early dismissal. \u201cNot many teams will get the reception we did after losing at home,\u201d acknowledges McClaren. \u201cWe have to keep showing that spirit, togetherness and fight. For various reasons it will be slow but there\u2019s a transition here, it\u2019s about trying to change the culture and environment in the club and the city. There was a lot of suspicion around everything and we\u2019re trying to dispel that suspicion.\u201d The goals shortage remains a concern. \u201cI think we\u2019re all going \u2018is that going to be a problem this year?\u2019\u201d he concedes. \u201cIt won\u2019t be answered until we\u2019ve played a few more games. I think we\u2019ve got players here that can score, not just strikers but wide players. Ayoze P\u00e9rez, Florian Thauvin and Moussa Sissoko and Gini Wijnaldum can score from midfield; we\u2019re just not seeing it at the moment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
