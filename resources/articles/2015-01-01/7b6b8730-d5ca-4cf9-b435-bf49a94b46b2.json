Although Pulis acknowledged \u201ceverybody is available\u201d and highlighted the fact that Liverpool sold Luis Su\u00e1rez to illustrate his point, the West Bromwich Albion head coach has been hugely impressed with Berahino so far and said that he wants the forward to spearhead the club\u2019s relegation fight. After being called up to the England squad in November on the back of an impressive start to the season, Berahino has been linked with several leading Premier League clubs, including Liverpool. Terry Burton, Albion\u2019s technical director, said last week that it would be left to Pulis to decide on whether he wanted to hold onto the club\u2019s leading scorer or cash in on a player who has been no stranger to controversy off the pitch. Only this week Berahino was charged with drink driving after being arrested by Cheshire Police in October. Berahino will appear before North Cheshire magistrates in Runcorn on 19 January, the same day Albion face Everton at Goodison Park in the Premier League. While full of admiration for Berahino\u2019s football ability and his work ethic on the training ground in the lead-up to Saturday\u2019s home game against Hull City, Pulis said that he had held one-on-one talks with the player to stress the importance of being \u201cdisciplined\u201d and maximising his talent. \u201cHe\u2019s got his whole footballing career in front of him, he\u2019s been given a gift by God and he\u2019s very fortunate,\u201d Pulis said. \u201cThe most important thing that he can do is make the most of it. He has to understand and recognise that to be a professional athlete, and a good professional athlete, you have to be disciplined, and that\u2019s most probably the way the conversation went.\u201d Asked whether he would prefer to have Berahino for the run-in or \u00a320m to spend, Pulis replied: \u201cFor everybody, we\u2019d like to keep him. You get a situation where Su\u00e1rez goes from Liverpool, when they finish second in the league last year, and they sell him because they thought it was the right deal for the football club. Everybody is available in some shape or form. With Saido there is no difference about that. If you\u2019re asking me: would I want to sell him now? Not at all \u2013 because he\u2019s been absolutely first class.\u201d With his natural goalscoring instincts, Pulis said that he views Berahino as a player to build a team around. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d said the Welshman. \u201cHe\u2019s a goalscorer. If he arrives in the box... he\u2019s got a knack of getting in their late. He\u2019s got the technical ability, he\u2019s also got wonderful balance - he can adjust his feet, adjust his body. He\u2019s gifted.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
