Which is why the news that he is to miss the rest of the season will be greeted with such disappointment at Goodison Park. Everton slid quietly into a Uefa Cup spot with this point but that will do little to soften the impact of Cahill's injury. The midfielder had been causing the home side problems - Claude Davis had prevented him putting the visitors in front with a superb goalline clearance - before he landed awkwardly after jumping for a routine header, breaking a metatarsal. \"It's a really big blow for us and a big blow for Tim because we've missed him already for three or four months with a knee injury,\" said Moyes. \"In lots of ways he's a big part. We miss his goals and I was saying to him before the game he is just about due one. He came close on a couple of occasions in the first half and I thought we did miss him when he went off.\" Everton have not had much luck with injuries this season with Cahill, as Moyes pointed out, one of those to have missed a significant chunk already. By Premiership standards their squad is small and the defence has been particularly affected - it is to their credit that only the top four have a lower tally in the goals against column. \"We're really short - we had one extra senior player available today,\" said Moyes, who was optimistic about the recovery of Nuno Valente, Tony Hibbert and James McFadden. \"We're on the verge of getting most players back fit. We've got only one game in March now, so I'm hoping that maybe, that one game excluded, we might have them all back for the run-in.\" All, that is, except Cahill. His removal from the game just before half-time had seemed to swing the momentum in the home side's favour, with the visitors missing the balance of Arteta's artistry and Aussie aggression. Rob Hulse turned in Colin Kazim-Richards' cross early in the second half to give Sheffield United the lead. The Blades, though, contrived to throw away two important points. Paddy Kenny, hesitant all game, horribly fumbled a routine catch, Johnson swooped and the goalkeeper's attempt to correct his error saw him bring down the forward. Another Johnson-won penalty, but this time there was no debate. Arteta's spot-kick, thundered in off the underside of the bar, was as unstoppable as a penalty can be. \"I feel sick, gutted inside, as I honestly could not see Everton scoring,\" said United's manager, Neil Warnock, who had seemingly blocked out Davis's early clearance. \"I've not said anything to Paddy. He hasn't said anything and he doesn't need to - he's saved us that many times. We just have to take it on the chin. It'll be a long two weeks for him because you want another game after a mistake like that.\" United go to Stamford Bridge on Saturday week and then travel to Bolton, so the pressure could be on by the time they next play at Bramall Lane in April. Warnock professed to be eyeing the teams above in the table but the collective groan that greeted the announcement of Charlton's comeback at Vicarage Road showed where the United fans are looking.
