This afternoon, Activision's hype monster, was the subject of an astonishing parliamentary face-off between Labour MPs Keith Vaz and Tom Watson. Vaz, who'd already sought approval from his chums at the Daily Mail by providing an ill-informed quote for the paper's balanced article on the title, asked the following question in the Commons: \"Given the recommendations of the Byron Review, what steps is the government proposing to take in order to ensure these violent games do not fall into the hands of children and young people?\" The query is, let's be brutally honest here, staggeringly irrelevant and shamelessly opportunistic. The Byron Review has been thoroughly debated and its recommendations heeded. The BBFC, an established ratings body with years of experience dealing first hand with controversial material (rather than merely reacting to tabloid conjecture), has rated the game and passed it as suitable for adults. Now it is up to retailers to ensure they do not sell the game to minors \u2013 just as it is up to retailers not to sell alcohol to minors. Perhaps Vaz would be better off spending his time asking questions about this considering the epidemic levels of underage drinking throughout the UK. Interestingly though, his latest tirade against the games industry \u2013 one of the British economy's biggest success stories over the last ten years \u2013 has fallen flat. Over on the Daily Mail site, a majority of readers have been supportive of Infinity Ward's shooter: \"Articles like this really irritate me. THIS IS A GAME!!! It in no way reflects on real life, its rated 18 to prevent those who lack the maturity to decipher the difference between imagination and reality,\" raged one reader. Of course, the paper's online community cannot be held up as entirely representative of the readership as a whole, but it's an interesting sign of videogaming's penetration of the mainstream market. Better yet, Labour MP for West Bromwich East, Tom Watson, has launched a withering response to Vaz's knee-jerk comments in the shape of a Facebook pressure group entitled Gamers' Voice. \"Are you sick of UK newspapers and (my fellow) politicians beating up on gaming?\" Watson asks. \"So am I. The truth is, UK gamers need their own pressure group. I want to help you start one up.\" There is no clear directive for the group at present, but it now has over 4,000 members. Watson isn't alone in his defense of the industry \u2013 there are other supportive MPs \u2013 but this is a highly visible stance taken over a massively important game. It is also hugely encouraging to see Vaz taken on in this manner - although it is perfectly justifiable for an MP to pursue such an agenda (this is a democracy after-all, and some of the personal attacks made against Vaz on the Gamers' Group page have been sickeningly counter-productive), negative commentary should at least be based on experience and understanding of the subject matter - and the opinions of voters. With over 24 million current gen consoles now in UK homes and sales of many millions expected for Modern warfare 2, surely one thing Labour can do without is MPs jumping aboard rusting bandwagons, heading nowhere slowly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
