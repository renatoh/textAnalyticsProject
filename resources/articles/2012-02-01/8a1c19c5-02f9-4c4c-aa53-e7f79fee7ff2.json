City hoped Tevez would be back from his self-imposed exile in his homeland by now, and have registered him as a Premier League player for the second half of the season and been careful not to close off any avenues for communication or rapprochement. It is unlikely, given what has already happened, that Tevez will figure greatly in Mancini's plans for the rest of the season, but City do not want to be seen to be forcing him out, particularly when only having three strikers leaves them vulnerable to injuries or suspensions in the title run-in. \"Everyone knows Carlos is a top player,\" Mancini said. \"If he was here and playing it would be better, because Carlos can change games. If he were to come back next week maybe he can still help us in the next three months. \"It depends on his condition, and when he returns. We have already played a lot of games with only one striker. But Carlos knows the situation. I talked to him before he left, to try to resolve this situation, and if he comes back we can talk again. I don't have any problem with that. If he wants to play, it could happen.\" Mario Balotelli serves the last game of his suspension in City's visit to Aston Villa on Sunday, and together with the Tour\u00e9 brothers, back from the Africa Cup of Nations, will be available for the midweek game against Porto in the Europa League. \"Mario is looking forward to playing again, we will have to assess the others when we meet up again,\" Mancini said. \"I spoke to Yaya Tour\u00e9 a few days ago and he told me he was very tired, after playing five game in 15 days. But when we come back from Porto we do not have a game, so there is time for everyone to recover. \"I intend to name a strong team for the Europa League because we want to go to the final. It will be difficult because Porto are a top team. But if we have all the players back without injury we can make a few changes. We want to do the best we can.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
