Thankfully for Sibon and Sheffield Wednesday, Shefki Kuqi had already scored an injury-time goal to give the visiting team a shock victory. Wednesday looked to have thrown away a rare win when they conceded a penalty 14 minutes from time. They were then hanging on, having also had two players carried off on stretchers. Burnley were caught on the break three minutes into time added on at the end when Kuqi beat the offside trap to score. The Finnish striker was tripped four minutes later by Arthur Gnohere to earn a penalty, which was saved by Nik Michopoulos. An edgy start from both teams made for a far from attractive match on a cold and windy afternoon. Burnley, playing their first home league match of the new year, were expected to go for the jugular of a struggling Wednesday, whose very existence could depend on them avoiding relegation from the First Division. The balance of play was fairly even, but it was Wednesday who had the best of the early chances and Kuqi twice went close to giving them the lead. Lee Briscoe first threatened for Burnley, but his volley went over the crossbar. A goal for either side hardly looked likely, but when it did come, nine minutes before half-time, it was a scrappy affair. Gareth Taylor had been caught offside attacking the Wednesday goal, enabling keeper Kevin Pressman to launch a long free-kick into the Burnley penalty area. Kuqi helped the ball on, Efan Ekoku swung and missed and, as the Burnley defence stood and watched, Paul McLaren forced home the loose ball. Burnley briefly rallied, but Wednesday grew in stature after the goal and had their band of loyal supporters singing all the way through to the half-time whistle. The home side could have silenced them, though, had Taylor been more accurate with a header from six yards out and Alan Moore been a touch more fortunate when his 25-yard drive clipped the Wednesday crossbar just before the break. The Wednesday fans were still in full voice when play resumed and their side nearly doubled their lead 18 seconds into the second half. Burnley defender Ian Cox made a mess of an attempted interception and Kuqi was in on goal again. Michopoulos reacted quickly this time, though, and raced off his line to block a certain goal. Pressman, meanwhile, was still to be really tested by the strangely shot-shy Burnley strikeforce. The Burnley supporters did not really know how to take it. They had seen their side beaten only once at home all season and Wednesday were not supposed to be putting up a fight, let alone having the better of the game. Slowly, their team responded to the evident frustration being barked at them, but they still lacked the necessary sharpness in front of goal, as was shown by Taylor's limp attempt to back-heel the ball over the line from substitute Bradley Maylett's pass. It took an appalling bit of luck to shift the play in Burnley's favour when, with 22 minutes to go, Wednesday midfielder Marlon Broomes was carried off after an innocuous-looking challenge from Maylett. Burnley were level soon after when referee Mike Pike awarded them a 76th-minute penalty after Ashley Westwood had handled. Taylor drove the ball into the middle of the goal. Pressman proceeded to make two point-blank saves from Taylor, the second resulting in injury, ending Pressman's involvement in the game with four minutes remaining. The injuries produced seven minutes of added time and that was when the game was decided."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
