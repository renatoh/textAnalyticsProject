Bolivia\u2019s defence minister, Javier Zavaleta, said on Friday that no military action would be taken against the police involved for now and the government would not mobilise troops as tens of thousands of Bolivians took to the streets in cities across the country. The commander general of the Bolivian police said the officers had been \u201cgarrisoned\u201d and had not mutinied. Television images showed thousands of protesters gathered in peaceful vigils throughout the night at police stations and army barracks. More began to arrive at sunrise on Saturday morning. Bolivia\u2019s interior minister, Carlos Romero, said in a televised address that a \u201ccoup strategy was taking place\u201d and hinted that talks could take place to try to resolve the escalating political crisis as protesters call for Morales to step down amid accusations of fraud in October\u2019s presidential elections. In La Paz, crowds cheered dozens of police officers who marched down a main avenue and garrisoned themselves in the city\u2019s central police station. Other police remained on the streets guarding barricades around the presidential palace on Friday but the mood was starkly different from previous nights of clashes as protesters surrounded them singing: \u201cBrother, police, join the people.\u201d In the rest of the country, police units in the official capital, Sucre, and the most populous city, Santa Cruz, a bastion of the opposition, announced they were joining a mutiny launched by police officers in Cochabamba. Uniformed police waved Bolivia\u2019s red, yellow and green flags from the rooftop of their station in Cochabamba. Local reports showed protesters picketing police stations in other cities urging officers to join them. At least three people have died, the latest a 20-year-old student on Wednesday, in clashes between anti-government protesters and Morales\u2019 supporters since the disputed election on 20 October. A civic opposition leader, Luis Fernando Camacho, who urged the police to turn against the government, tweeted that he \u201ccried with joy\u201d and thanked the police for \u201csiding with the people\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
