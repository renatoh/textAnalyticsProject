Couldn\u2019t cope with the energy of Matuidi, Verratti and Motta in the centre Ramires 6 Is clearly a favourite of Mourinho for his industry but could not wrest control from PSG\u2019s midfield, even against 10 men, and was booked Oscar 5 Was possibly as culpable in the red card incident as Ibrahimovic, and after being booked was replaced by Willian at half-time Eden Hazard 6 Bright and energetic early on \u2013 he looked to have the beating of Marquinhos, but could not exert his influence fully even with an extra man Diego Costa 6 Not the shy, retiring type, is he? Early row with David Luiz carried on all game, should have had a penalty but he plays the game on the edge Substitutes: Willian (for Oscar, h-t); Zouma (for Matic, 84); Drogba (for Ramires, 91) Not used Cech, Filipe Lu\u00eds, R\u00e9my, Cuadrado PSG Salvatore Sirigu 7 It was no great surprise when PSG eventually conceded from a set piece but the Italian held firm under pressure and some late high balls Marquinhos 6 The youngest member of an all-Brazilian back four, and it showed at times as he struggled to keep tabs on Hazard and Costa David Luiz 7 The Brazilian was desperate to impress on his return to Stamford Bridge and his powerful headed equaliser certainly did just that Thiago Silva 8 The captain was distraught when he gave away a needless extra-time penalty, but atoned and then some with towering header to decide it Maxwell 7 The experienced Brazilian kept a calm head while many of his team-mates didn\u2019t and intelligent positioning helped PSG stay in the game Blaise Matuidi 7 An irrepressible bundle of energy from box-to-box, he ran himself into the ground long before he was substituted late in normal time Thiago Motta 7 Lucky to escape an early booking for a blatant bodycheck on F\u00e0bregas and while he was booked in the end it was only after a fine battling display Marco Verratti 7 The combative little Italian showed why he is a favourite at his club with a scrapping display, literally at times as he took the fight to Chelsea Edinson Cavani 7 Perhaps should have given a penalty away for clumsy tackle on Costa, missed a superb chance when he hit the inside of a post but kept going Zlatan Ibrahimovic 5 The myth has it that he never plays well against English clubs, but he didn\u2019t get the chance here after his tackle on Oscar. Red card looked harsh Javier Pastore 6 Preferred to Lavezzi but his role changed after the sending-off. Despite that he could have done better with a couple of half-chances to win it Substitutes: Lavezzi (for Matuidi, 81); Rabiot (for Verratti, 82); Van der Weil (for Pastore,118) Not used Douchez, Camara, Bahebeck, Digne Referee: B Kuipers (Neth)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
