Credit and store cards make borrowing too easy and charge high rates. \u0095 Tell your creditors when you move home or they may tire of writing to you for money and take legal action. \u0095 Resist offers to consolidate your student loan into another, dearer one. The original loans, pegged to inflation, are a very good deal. \u0095 Talk to your creditors if you have difficulty meeting your repayments. They may offer a compromise deal. \u0095 Build an emergency fund of up to three months' pay. \u0095 Know yourself: if you fear overspending, you should shun credit cards; if you are cautious, make repaying debt a priority; if you are reckless, consider savings and investments. \u0095 Check the banks' graduate deals, including cheap loans. Click here for some useful information. \u0095 Don't always assume your parents are right about money. Many older people see borrowing as a first step to hell, but their children and grandchildren are more flexible. \u0095 You must know by now how much money landlords make. So, if you can afford it, consider investing in property. \u0095 Remember your skills are in demand. Think big and approach potential employers with enthusiasm - a \u00a325K salary is just around the corner"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
