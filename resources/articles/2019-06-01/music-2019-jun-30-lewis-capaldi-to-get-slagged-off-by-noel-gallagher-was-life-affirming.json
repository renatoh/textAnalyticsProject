This figure comes as news to him, backstage at the Other stage on Saturday afternoon, shortly after his set. \u201cIt\u2019s too many people, innit?\u201d he says. What would be the optimum number? \u201cOne thousand? I have no clue what I\u2019m doing. I feel that I\u2019m very much out of my depth.\u201d One thousand might be a more fitting number for an artist whose debut album was released only in May. But Capaldi\u2019s rise this year has been stratospheric: Someone You Loved has become one of the year\u2019s biggest-selling singles, while Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent has been the No 1 album for five of the past six weeks. Capaldi seems a bit stunned by it all. He is even getting recognised, forcing him to don a disguise of hat and sunglasses to watch Stormzy\u2019s headline set on Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve always found that I\u2019ve got a bit of a plain face,\u201d he says. Before this weekend, the 22-year-old Scot had never been to Glastonbury: first he was too young, then he could not afford a ticket. He struggles to describe the experience of performing: \u201cI wish I had more words. It was so, so mad. It was the first time I almost cried on stage \u2013 I got a bit teary towards the end there.\u201d Preparations had been limited to a rehearsal, a secret set on the BBC Music Introducing stage on Thursday and an appearance with Bastille on the Pyramid stage on Friday. \u201cI just went on, did my warmups and stuff, as usual. But I don\u2019t think you can prepare for that sort of thing anyway. \u201cI was kind of foolishly treating it as \u2018just another festival\u2019, but then you go on and you\u2019re like: \u2018This is not just another festival, it\u2019s 60,000 people.\u2019 There\u2019s just something about it \u2013 you watch it on TV for so long. It\u2019s more than a festival.\u201d The famously self-deprecating singer did his best to strip the occasion of any gravity, with \u201ca big silly entrance\u201d, as he calls it, that referenced Noel Gallagher\u2019s recent observation that \u201cmusic is fucking wank at the moment. Who\u2019s this Capaldi fella?\u201d Capaldi embraced the criticism by appearing on stage in an Oasis-style parka that he removed to reveal a T-shirt featuring Gallagher\u2019s face inside a love heart. (Gallagher\u2019s daughter, Ana\u00efs, later tweeted: \u201cI want to be @LewisCapaldi when I grow up.\u201d) \u201cTo get slagged off by Noel was, for me, a real life-affirming moment,\u201d says Capaldi. Would he like to slag off anyone in return? \u201cThat\u2019s not really my move. Ask me at the end of the year.\u201d It did take a moment to change gear, from \u201ccomedy entrance\u201d to \u201cgig of your life\u201d. \u201cIt was all a good laugh, then I realised: \u2018I\u2019ve got a gig to play here\u2019 \u2026 I wasn\u2019t prepared for that many people. The first half-minute was a bit nervy.\u201d Nick Cave has said that, as a performer, he is a \u201cfront-row man\u201d, singing to those in the audience closest to him, while Bono is a \u201cback-row man\u201d \u2013 where is Capaldi directing his energy? \u201cJust kind of looking at the sea of it \u2026 I\u2019ve never had to play to that many people. I\u2019m still kind of working out who I\u2019m fixating on.\u201d Next year, assuming he isn\u2019t booked (\u201cWell, we\u2019ve done it now, innit?\u201d), he intends to return to Glastonbury for fun. \u201cI\u2019d love to come back. Put that in!\u201d Shall we record that he will do it for free? \u201cErm, I\u2019ll do it for less. But, if not, I\u2019ll be here as a punter. This has given me the camping bug again. I\u2019m like: \u2018I just want to be in a tent, loving it.\u2019\u201d It is a lot less comfortable than backstage, though. \u201cNot if you\u2019re drunk enough. As long as you bring your own loo roll, you\u2019re good.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
