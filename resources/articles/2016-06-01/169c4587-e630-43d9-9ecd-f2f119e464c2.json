Carney worked with the actor on his hit 2013 romantic comedy, Begin Again, and had described her in the interview as a \u201csupermodel\u201d, adding that she hadn\u2019t got the essence of her character, a singer-songwriter, and was constantly surrounded by an entourage. On Twitter, Carney posted a screenshot of a typed statement saying: \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of myself that I could say such things and I\u2019ve been trying to account for what they say about me. In trying to pick holes in my work, I ended up blaming someone else.\u201d \u201cKeira was nothing but professional and dedicated during that film and she contributed hugely to its success,\u201d he added, before concluding that what he said about the actor is \u201cnot something I could ever justify, and will never repeat\u201d. In the interview \u2013 done to promote the release of his latest film, Sing Street \u2013 Carney had said that Begin Again had taught him \u201cnever [to] make a film with supermodels again.\u201d \u201cKeira\u2019s thing is to hide who you are, and I don\u2019t think you can be an actor and do that,\u201d he had said of his experience working with her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rubbish Keira, but you know it\u2019s hard being a film actor, and it requires a certain level of honesty and self-analysis that I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ready for yet and I certainly don\u2019t think she was ready for on that film.\u201d Following the comments, many directors who had worked with Knightley rallied to her defence. Mark Romanek, who directed the actor in Never Let Me Go, wrote on Twitter that working with Knightley was \u201cutterly spectacular\u201d. Meanwhile Lorene Scafaria, Knightley\u2019s director for Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, said she was \u201cjust lovely\u201d, and Say When director Lynn Shelton also referred to the actor as \u201cmagnificent\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
