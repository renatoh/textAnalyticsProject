A group led by Mr Bronfman edged out EMI, leaving the British music company out in the cold for the third time in three years. EMI itself tried to merge with Warner Music three years ago, but the bid was blocked by the EU competition authorities. The company also failed to net Sony Music, which decided to merge with Bertelsmann's BMG earlier this month. Time Warner decided that the Bronfman bid would have better chances of clearing regulatory hurdles on both sides of the Atlantic, especially at a time of another big music merger. Music companies are seeking to merge in order to cut costs at a time when sales have been hit by internet piracy and a lack of new talent to excite punters. Warner Music's roster includes Madonna, Led Zeppelin and REM, and the sale will allow Time Warner to reduce its enormous debt. \"It would have taken many months to complete a deal with EMI,\" Time Warner chief executive, Richard Parsons, told Reuters. For Mr Bronfman, the deal gives the former chief executive of the entertainment and drinks conglomerate, Seagram, a chance to restore his tarnished reputation. Three years ago, Mr Bronfman sold Seagram - his family's company - to France's Vivendi Universal. The move was supposed to protect the family fortune. But Vivendi's then boss, Jean-Marie Messier, went on a buying binge to realise his ambition of building a media colossus to rival Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Disney. All Mr Messier achieved was to bring Vivendi to the verge of collapse. By the time he was booted out by key shareholders, including Mr Bronfman, the value of the Bronfmans' stake had shrunk from $6.5bn to $3bn, a huge loss for the family, even if only on paper. Early on in his career though, Mr Bronfman did have some success as he built Universal Music into the world's biggest record company. Mr Bronfman, who tried to buy back Vivendi this year but lost out to NBC, is expected to take the post of chief executive at the new company, which will retain the name Warner Music. Roger Ames, the current chairman, is expected to stay on. \"Warner Music Group is one of the world's greatest recorded music and music publishing companies, and we have great faith in its potential for growth as an independent company and in the long-term opportunities of this industry,\" Mr Bronfman said. \"We have brought together a highly sophisticated and well-financed group of investors to support the business.\" EMI, whose artists include Robbie Williams, Kylie Minogue and Radiohead, threw in the towel earlier today. \"We have concluded that it is no longer possible to reach an agreement on terms which would be acceptable to both parties and in the interests of EMI's shareholders,\" the EMI chairman, Eric Nicoli, said in a statement. EMI has now become a potential takeover target with reports that Blackstone, the US investment group, is interested in bidding \u00a31bn for the company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
