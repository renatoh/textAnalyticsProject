Not only has the promoter brought the world heavyweight championship to Saudi Arabia, he is also rapidly embracing its culture. In a country ranked 172 out of 180 in the world press freedom index \u2013 two places above Syria and seven ahead of North Korea \u2013 he did not bother to invite questions from journalists at the final press conference before Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr meet in a rematch on Saturday. Still, Hearn was able to glean a few nuggets by himself. That Ruiz is convinced his opponent will come in lighter and faster, in a bid to dance and entrance for 12 rounds. That Joshua has forewarned his audience \u201cI am not here to put on a show, I am here to win\u201d. And finally \u2013 as every fighter on the bill kept reminding us \u2013 that the hospitality of the Saudis has been spectacular. At one point Joshua even described Diriyah, on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh, as \u201cthe real Mecca of boxing\u201d \u2013 which will raise eyebrows in Las Vegas to put it mildly. The press conference might have been held in a luxury box overlooking the city\u2019s Formula E track, but there was little chance of Hearn doing a U-turn about coming to the Middle East. In fact, the promoter doubled down on his decision, lavishing praise on his hosts as he predicted a \u201chistoric\u201d night of boxing. Addressing Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, he told him: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how honoured I am to be in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We were very close to going to Wales, then I got a message from Prince Khalid. I told him: \u2018Don\u2019t waste our time.\u2019 But the passion this man had to bring the fight here was undeniable. \u201cSometimes there was shock. Sometimes there was criticism. Sitting here today I can tell you it was a wonderful, wonderful decision.\u201d Then came a delightfully sycophantic question for the prince. \u201cI know you as the one and only Big K,\u201d said Hearn, beaming like the cat that has not only got the cream but is having it mainlined into his mouth. \u201cHow does it feel to be bringing the fight here?\u201d After a few words of happiness from the prince, Hearn was off again. \u201cJust 10 weeks ago they embarked on getting a purpose-built stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not just done \u2013 it is done as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world. My stomach right now is full of butterflies. This is a new dawn for the sport of boxing.\u201d History will be the judge of that. But for now at least the big fight playbook is not so very different. At the traditional staredown Ruiz, wearing a New York Knicks top to remind him of where he ripped the WBA, IBF and WBO belts from Joshua\u2019s grasp in June, started shouting: \u201cAnd still! And still!\u201d Joshua\u2019s camp replied: \u201cAnd the new!\u201d Then the boxers smiled and shook hands. At least we can say this with confidence: both men are a credit to their sport. Earlier the Mexican-American had promised to be fully prepared. \u201cIt has been a long three months in camp and I am ready to rock and roll,\u201d said Ruiz. \u201cI know Joshua will come with a different gameplan, that he has lost weight and will try and box me around. But I am ready. I have been doing this since I was six years old. It has been a long rollercoaster, and there is no way I am going to let these belts go.\u201d Joshua, meanwhile, hinted at the single-mindedness that has possessed him ever since losing his belts at Madison Square Garden. \u201cAs soon I got back from New York, I didn\u2019t lose any heart, I didn\u2019t lose any fire in my belly, and I went straight back to hitting the heavy bag at Finchley ABC,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no fear in my heart, no fear in my eyes, no fear in my mind.\u201d Tellingly, he also gave a warning to those expecting a repeat of their brawl in June. \u201cI am not here to put on a show, I am here to win.\u201d And after a lot of hype and hot air, that truth carried all the power of one of his overhand rights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
