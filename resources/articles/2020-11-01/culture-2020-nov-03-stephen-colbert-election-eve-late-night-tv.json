The \u201chighway hooliganism has no place in a free country,\u201d Colbert added. \u201cSo obviously Trump was super into it.\u201d At a rally on Sunday evening, Trump called the truck drivers \u201creally good people\u201d who \u201cescorted\u201d the bus along the highway. \u201cClearly false,\u201d said Colbert, \u201cbut I\u2019m guessing not the first time Trump has lied about an escort.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel \u201cHow\u2019s everybody feeling tonight, relaxed?\u201d asked Jimmy Kimmel on the eve of the election. \u201cWhat a great time to be alone in a house filled with giant bags of mini candy bars,\u201d he added, for an evening akin to \u201csomewhere between Christmas Eve and the night before a liver transplant\u201d. The whole mess of a pandemic, high-stakes election \u201creally is unbelievable\u201d, Kimmel continued. \u201cRight now, they\u2019re erecting a massive protective fence around the White House in the event that things get crazy. Took four years, but Trump finally got his wall built. \u201cAnd you\u2019d think that that would be too much even for Donald Trump,\u201d Kimmel continued. \u201cWell, turns out it\u2019s not. In fact, he encouraged them to do more.\u201d In a tweet, Trump called the armed Texas pickup truck caravan that surrounded a Biden/Harris bus \u201cpatriots\u201d who \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and claimed the FBI and Department of Justice \u201cshould be investigating the terrorists, anarchists, and agitators of ANTIFA, who run around burning down our Democrat run cities and hurting our people!\u201d \u201cHe cares nothing about this country,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cIf he loses, he wants us to pull each other\u2019s heads off.\u201d Trevor Noah With one day to go, \u201cat this point, the election is like choosing between going to the ballet, and breaking into the zoo to watch chimps mate\u201d, joked Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. \u201cYou know which one fits your vibe.\u201d \u201cLook, we all need to be reasonable,\u201d he later added. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to violence. Although, according to the candidates, maybe there is?\u201d On the campaign trail this weekend, both candidates joked about taking punches at the other candidate in what Noah imagined as \u201cthe first UFC fight sponsored by Life Alert\u201d. Trump also falsely claimed ballots counted after election day should be considered illegitimate, \u201cwhich makes no sense\u201d, Noah said. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying that oh that\u2019s not your kid because it was born after its due date. \u201cNobody is surprised by this,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cTrump wants the race called on election night because he thinks that\u2019ll ensure that he wins. But I promise you now: if Biden wins on election night, then Trump will say you have to hold everything until all the votes are counted.\u201d Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers demanded news networks prepare to accurately cover a premature declaration of victory by Trump. \u201cIf Trump decides to just declare victory, TV networks should refuse to air it, or at the very least make clear that it\u2019s meaningless,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just declare yourself president any more than I can go to the mall and declare myself New Hampshire\u2019s sexiest man. \u201cThere\u2019s virtually no dispute about who\u2019s actually going to win more votes, so this is all Trump and his allies have left: cheating,\u201d he added. \u201cThe president and Republican party have left the nation in tatters after four years of crisis, incompetence and greed.\u201d Trump Republicans, in other words, \u201chave nothing to run on\u201d, Meyers added, \u201cwhich is why they\u2019ve built their entire campaign strategy around whipping up fear and calling anyone who opposes them an angry mob\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
