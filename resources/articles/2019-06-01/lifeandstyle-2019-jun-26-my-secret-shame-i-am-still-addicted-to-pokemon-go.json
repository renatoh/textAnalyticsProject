The thousands of people gathered for the city\u2019s third annual Pok\u00e9mon Go Fest, already sodden after a day of drizzle and rain, are now being told to evacuate for fear of lightning strikes. But I need to take a snapshot of a Gastly in the Spooky Woods if I\u2019m going to complete this year\u2019s festival challenge and uncover a rare new Pok\u00e9mon. And I don\u2019t have a Gastly. Risking death by lightning, I jog towards the Spooky Woods. My name is Dominic. I\u2019m 52. I have two twentysomething children and a part-share in a Pulitzer prize. I read philosophy and listen to Stockhausen for fun. And I love Pok\u00e9mon Go. I also hate myself for it: my boyfriend rolls his eyes when I play, my kids think it\u2019s sad, and the colleagues who know about it probably secretly judge me. It is my secret shame, but I am not alone. For those who have been hiding under a Bulbasaur, Pok\u00e9mon Go is an augmented reality game where players, armed with their phones, collect Pok\u00e9mon in the real world. The cute little creatures pop up on a map of your surroundings as you explore on foot, and you just have to catch them. At Pok\u00e9stops dotted around the world, you spin a disk (often tied to a local landmark) to receive the balls needed to catch Pokemon, as well as assorted presents (more balls, stardust, eggs that hatch into new creatures). It\u2019s a social game too \u2013 sort of. You can team up with other players to battle more powerful Pok\u00e9mon at \u201cgyms\u201d, or swap Pok\u00e9mon with your friends (that\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d in the social media sense \u2013 in other words, not really your friends. Or are they? It\u2019s complicated). Before the storm in Chicago descends, I bump into an attractive middle-aged couple catching Pok\u00e9mon in the park. The pair would look more at home sipping smoothies after pilates than stalking digital creatures with their phones. When I get out my notebook, they exchange a look. He is a sales director for a Fortune 500 company, and she runs a non-profit. They will only give me their Pok\u00e9mon Go handles: Oceanna131450 and BeachBaby503. \u201cWe\u2019re closeted,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody at work knows I play.\u201d BeachBaby503 says their children got them into Pok\u00e9mon Go when it launched in 2016. Their kids soon stopped playing, but they never have. They are both level 40, the highest level in the game (I am a 36.) Oceanna131450 hit 40 in year one and has walked 6,234km in the game \u2013 roughly the distance between Chicago and Panama. \u201cWe\u2019re very goal-oriented,\u201d he laughs. I, too, have been playing Pok\u00e9mon Go since the app was launched. In the beginning, I hid my obsession in plain sight. Everyone was doing it: the app had been downloaded 500m times by the end of the year. Celebrities had Pok\u00e9mon fever, and even my co-workers were taking ironic snapshots of Pok\u00e9mon at Trump rallies. Then Hillary Clinton ruined it all, as she has so many things. \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go to the polls!\u201d she shouted at a rally in Ohio, ensuring Trump\u2019s victory and ending the golden dawn of the Pok\u00e9mon age. The fad faded. But not for me \u2013 I went underground. Three years on, I have walked 1,841km in Pok\u00e9-land, or 1,144 miles. That\u2019s the distance between New York City and Orlando, Florida. I have caught more than 11,000 Pok\u00e9mon, flicking balls at critters in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and in Tokyo, Mexico City, Miami and Jackson, Mississippi. If I\u2019ve been there, I have Pok\u00e9moned. I frequently sneak out to battle in raids to win rare Pok\u00e9mon on street corners with equally furtive-looking strangers. Many players are my age \u2013 give or take 20 years. It\u2019s never kids, and it\u2019s always a mixed crowd: Latino construction workers, women in business suits, journalists. We gather on street corners, a secret society exchanging furtive nods and tips, waiting for the battle to begin. \u201cPsst. There are Snorlax in Bryant Park.\u201d \u201cYou wanna trade a shiny?\u201d Then we hammer away at our phones for a few moments before dispersing. Most often, we don\u2019t exchange a word. So what could explain this passion? It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve often asked myself, and I have theories. First, there\u2019s BF Skinner. Skinner, an American psychologist, developed the concept of \u201coperant conditioning\u201d, which shows how rewards and punishments modify behaviour. While Skinner had pigeons and rats pecking at buttons for food for his experiments, I am checking my phone for virtual rewards. A lot of the time I don\u2019t get what I want, and this, it turns out, feeds my addiction. Subjects (pigeons, rats, me) tire of a task if they always get what they want. If it\u2019s more hit and miss, they stay interested. Skinner\u2019s research helps explain why we still keep looking at Facebook, Instagram, our increasingly unmanageable emails. We are looking for that hit again amid all those yawn-inducing misses. Operant conditioning, however, can\u2019t take all the blame. I have been hooked on other apps: Words With Friends, Draw With Friends, Dots, all the way back to Snake. But in every case, my devotion soon died. Why does Pok\u00e9mon still have my heart? Enter Guy Debord, my favorite French Marxist theorist and founding member of the Situationist International. Debord\u2019s most famous 1967 work, Society of the Spectacle, foresaw a new era of capitalism where the masses would be pacified and distracted by \u201cthe spectacle\u201d \u2013 the reduction of our lives to a never-ending and all-consuming stream of media, images and messages. Sacr\u00e9 bleu! Was he ever right. To disrupt the spectacle, the Situationists had a tool called d\u00e9rive, a sort of unstructured urban wandering that allowed people to reclaim the landscape for their own purposes. Pok\u00e9mon Go isn\u2019t quite what Debord had in mind, but when I play in a shopping mall, an airport, a museum, or in the line at the DMV, those landscapes are being repurposed. A new layer is imposed on top of the prescribed one, the map is redrawn, functions are subverted. I turn left when I should go right, north when I should go south, just to explore a new part of the city. Pok\u00e9mon gives me an excuse to wander. Which is why, back at Chicago\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Go Fest, I find myself in a field risking my life for a Gastly, hoping to find the true reason behind my Pok\u00e9mon addiction. Over the three-day event, 60,000 people gathered in the magnificent surroundings of Grant Park, walking 290,000km and catching 15m Pok\u00e9mon. Pretty impressive for a fad that has supposedly fizzled. The park was divided into zones. You can catch ice-type Pok\u00e9mon in the Winter Forest (fitted out with snow machines and mini mountains), ghost types like my missing Gastly were in the Spooky Woods (where cobwebs hung from the trees), while others were hiding in the Fairy Garden, or the Sandy Desert. The crowd has to be the most mixed event group I have ever seen. There are kids, but they don\u2019t seem to be playing (it costs $25 to play at the event and they were just along for the ride). There are black, white, Asian and Hispanic Pok\u00e9mon hunters. Some of the older ones are in motorized wheelchairs. It\u2019s about a 50-50 split between men and women. Everyone is staring at their phones, but when I interrupt them, they couldn\u2019t be nicer. As the rain starts, I shelter under a tree. \u201cDo you want a rain poncho? I brought spares,\u201d says the woman standing next to me. A healthcare worker called Tyler Spence rushes over to help when he sees me taking a selfie. \u201cYou want me to take that?\u201d he asks. He drove seven hours from Minnesota to get here. When I ask him about Pok\u00e9-shame, he gets it. \u201cPeople laugh. They say you: can\u2019t possibly still be playing that?\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t care. Spence has traveled the US making new friends and playing Pok\u00e9mon. \u201cI enjoy it for me,\u201d he says. Arnulfo Guevara, 35, drove from Los Angeles with five friends. They took turns driving and only stopped for food and rest breaks, setting off at 7pm on Wednesday and arriving at 3am Friday. With his triple-pierced lip and chic rain poncho, Guevara looks like he should be sipping organic yerba mate in some downtown hipster joint. \u201cI get teased a lot,\u201d he says, tapping away at his phone with his beautifully manicured neon orange nails. \u201cPeople are like, are you for real?\u201d By the end of the day, my shame is ebbing. Pok\u00e9mon people are lovely. Many (but far from all) seem shy and introverted. They are together but separate, their interactions mediated by the game, but their friendship and kindness are real. Still, I can\u2019t escape the feeling that all this is really, desperately, sad. The night before my day at the Fest I was invited out for dinner by gay Pok\u00e9mon friends who had already had their day in the park. There are a lot of gay people playing Pok\u00e9mon. Over pad thai in Boystown, TylerandJohn2 tells me there are a load of the exclusive symbol-shaped Unowns in the park. Then he drops a bombshell. Apparently if you collect them all, he says, they spell: \u2018Wake up! I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. Whenever I see an Unown, the doubt comes back again. The spectacle has me in its thrall. What the hell am I doing? I should have downloaded Duolingo and learned Spanish instead. Wake up! The next day, my self-loathing has dissipated again. I am having fun strolling in the park, chatting, catching Pok\u00e9mon. Oh look, a Pachirisu! A snow white and baby blue electric squirrel with a spiky tail. So cute! Back at Spooky Woods, as the speaker system warns us all to leave or risk electrocution, I manage to bag a Gastly, take my snapshot and complete the next stage of my task \u2013 allowing me to catch a rare Pok\u00e9mon exclusively released at the Fest. When the storm passes, I finish the quest and am rewarded with a Jirachi, a flying \u201cwish-making\u201d Mythical Pok\u00e9mon. Again, the self-doubt creeps back. It stares at me with huge dead black eyes. I sink back into self-loathing, so I slope off to the Art Institute of Chicago, hoping high culture will detox my brain. Twenty minutes later, I have the app open again. There are Pok\u00e9stops all over the museum. There\u2019s even one at Grant Wood\u2019s American Gothic, one of America\u2019s most sacred paintings. I spin the image of their dour, judgey midwestern faces and Pok\u00e9balls come wheeling out. I actually LOL, IRL. Why beat myself up for having fun? You know what, American Gothic? YOU wake up!
