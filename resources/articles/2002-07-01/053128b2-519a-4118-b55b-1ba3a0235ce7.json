Business lobbies, pension providers, consumer bodies and some institutional investors gave the plans a guarded welcome as handing the government a \"golden opportunity\" to simplify provision. John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said: \"We could be looking at the biggest pension rip-off in history. This report consigns hard-working people to an old age of increasing poverty. The government has turned to an industry insider who is trying to make it as easy as possible for employers to renege on any pensions responsibility.\" His anger was echoed by Roger Lyons, co-leader of engineering union Amicus, who called the report a \"cop-out\" that \"shifts the cost of the crisis from the perpetrators to the victims\". Brendan Barber, deputy general secretary of the TUC, said: \"Ending the requirement on employer schemes to provide benefits for survivors will hit women in particular, as they tend to have smaller pensions and survive their partners. \"Ending indexation of salary-related pensions will lead to poverty in old age. In any case, we doubt whether these changes will encourage new schemes to be set up or to stop employers retreating from current schemes.\" Former union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe, president of the National Pensioners Convention, said of the report: \"It will sentence future generations of pensioners to a retirement on means-tested benefits and charitable hand-outs. The only way of providing security in retirement is through a decent state pensions that everyone can rely on.\" Former welfare reform minister Frank Field told BBC Radio 4 that people on low incomes would simply be unable to save for retirement. Promising a \"bold and radical\" government response, work and pensions minister Andrew Smith said an autumn green paper would make far-reaching changes to pensions policy to help people save more for retirement. The main employers' lobby, the CBI, said Pickering could help contain rising pension costs and stabilise the provision of final salary schemes. It urged the government to \"grasp the nettle\" without being \"seduced by simplistic arguments that blame employers for current difficulties\". These, according to its director of human resources policy, Susan Anderson, were caused by falling stock markets, an ageing population and the new accounting standards. Welcoming the report, Sheila McKechnie, director of the Consumers' Association, said it \"paves the way for the simplification and integration of pension provision\" and should allow for a more flexible system more in tune with today's lifestyle of changing jobs. The Association of British Insurers called for a pension contributions tax credit to buttress compulsory schemes while the Prudential urged fundamental changes to pensions tax. Steve Webb, Liberal Democrat shadow work and pensions secretary, said the government still needed to do more to tackle the huge pensions savings gap, and he called on it to make it compulsory for all employers to make a minimum contribution to staff funds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
