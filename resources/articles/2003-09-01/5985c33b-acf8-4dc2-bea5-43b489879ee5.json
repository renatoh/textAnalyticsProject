In a series of amendments in the House of Lords, which would have retained the essentials of the GLC, he and others almost succeeded in derailing the prime minister's plans. Hayter's skill at knitting together this coalition reinforced his position as a deputy chairman (or deputy speaker) in the Lords for 15 years from 1981. A crossbencher (or independent), he disappeared from the House with most other hereditaries in the 1999 cull. A shy man, who admitted \"I'm not a very good mixer\", Hayter was a distinguished industrialist, and the fifth generation of his family to be involved with the Wolverhampton locksmiths' firm of Chubbs. The company's success was built on the work of his great-great grandfather Charles Chubb, who invented the prizewinning detector lock back in 1818. Educated at the Leys school, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read history, Hayter wanted to be a barrister, but, at 20, capitulated, and learned lockmaking in Wolverhampton and salesmanship in London. After 10 years, he took over as managing director from his uncle in 1941, becoming chairman in 1957. He became a pillar among industrialists exporting to North America, Africa and Australasia. When he inherited the barony in 1967, he broke precedent by making a maiden speech on the role of locks and safes in crime prevention - in contrast to his father, who had never made a speech despite attending the Lords for 21 years. He became deputy chairman in 1981. Then, in 1984, along with Lords Elwyn-Jones (Labour), Molson (Tory) and Hooson (Liberal), Hayter signed a motion to delay the enactment of the GLC-destroying bill. The following April, he made a powerful speech pointing out the enormous cost of dispersing essential London services to non-elected quangos, and the unfairness of taking away the voting rights of several million Londoners. He tried - and almost succeeded - in establishing an elected successor authority, tagged the \"mini-GLC\", and sought to establish a \u00a310m fund to aid London's voluntary organisations after they were cut adrift by the abolition of the County Hall authority. In 1987, he made an effort to halt the Channel Tunnel bill, though most of his later political efforts were in defence of charities. He is survived by his wife Elizabeth, whom he married in 1940, a daughter and three sons. The eldest, George William Michael Chubb, succeeds him. \u00b7 George Charles Hayter Chubb, 3rd Baron Hayter, industrialist and politician, born 25 April 1911; died September 2 2003"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
