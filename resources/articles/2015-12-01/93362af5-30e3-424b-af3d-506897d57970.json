The tunnel, only 18in wide and 5ft high, leads 27ft directly into a circular ceremonial platform at the Great Temple or Templo Mayor complex of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, the ruined Aztec capital that overlaps with modern Mexico City. At the end of the tunnel the archaeologists found two sealed doors. According to the Spaniards who wrote of the conquest of Mexico, the Aztecs burned their kings\u2019 remains on the circular structure \u2013 suggesting to lead archaeologist Leonardo L\u00f3pez Luj\u00e1n that the sealed portals may lead to tombs. \u201cOnce we freed the passage from earth and stone, we knew it led directly into the heart of the Cuauhxicalco,\u201d L\u00f3pez Luj\u00e1n said, using the Aztec name for the large stone platform, meaning \u201ceagle cup\u201d. \u201cAt the end appear two old entrances sealed up with masonry.\u201d The passage is actually an extension of a tunnel unearthed in 2013, discovered when a researcher noted signs of a continuation. That year archaeologists heaved a three-ton rock away from the mouth of the tunnel, finding a large box in a hollow space beneath it. The box contained gold ornaments, stone knives and the bones of children and eagles. The human remains included two skulls belonging to children, aged five to seven, as well as bones from a hand and two feet. The knives and three vertebrae found with the skulls suggested they were sacrificed, a ritual practice relatively common among Aztec people, in which young children were often the preferred victims. \u201cFrom what the sources say, the Cuauhxicalco was a structure of a funerary character, so we can speculate that behind these walls there might be two small rooms that contain the incinerated remains of several leaders,\u201d L\u00f3pez Luj\u00e1n said. L\u00f3pez Luj\u00e1n said he suspected any remains might be of Moctezuma I and his successors, Ax\u00e1yacatl and T\u00edzoc, given the dating of the structure, referring to three of the earliest Aztec rulers. The trio ruled sometime during the 14th and the 15th centuries. The discovery of any Aztec ruler\u2019s remains would stand as a historic achievement \u2013 what the civilization did after leaders died remains one of the most enduring mysteries of the Aztec people. L\u00f3pez Luj\u00e1n urged caution and patience, saying that the tomb hypothesis was only that. He noted that archaeologists\u2019 hopes had been dashed many times before and said excavations on the doorways will begin in 2016. Unlike the tombs of the classic-period Maya, who laid out their kings in occasionally lavish chambers, Aztec burials from after 1000AD have eluded archaeologists, said Rosemary Joyce, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThey keep digging down hoping they\u2019re going to find the big guy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they\u2019re running out of places to look in Tenochtitl\u00e1n.\u201d Aztec images show dead rulers \u201cbundled up in cloth, seated upright, with little crowns on\u201d, she said, and indigenous people drew pictures of cremation ceremonies, but what they did with these ashes or bundles is unknown. The clues together present a tantalizing case for the tentative hopes of a tomb. The eagles \u2013 associated with the cremation stone and the sun god Huitzilopochtli \u2013 could also suggest a leader who wanted their own associations with the deity. Joyce noted that the dual doorways could be a reflection of how the Aztecs governed: with two rulers, a tlatoani \u2013 translated as \u201cemperor\u201d but more literally \u201cspeaker\u201d \u2013 and a cihuacoatl \u2013 a word with an ambiguous meaning, possibly \u201cwoman twin\u201d or \u201cskirt serpent\u201d. And while the Aztecs may have dispersed ashes or simply not buried them, Joyce agreed that the early rulers of Tenochtitl\u00e1n may have constituted a special case for a people who, unlike the Maya, did not have a cult of their ancestors or necessarily inherit power through family lines. \u201cThe remains of the first or founding generations of the Aztec rulers\u201d may have deserved their own tomb, she said, comparing to the symbolism Americans use to venerate George Washington. \u201cHe\u2019s not Barack Obama\u2019s great-great-great-grandfather, but he is the father of the nation.\u201d Susan Gillespie, an archaeologist at the University of Florida, agreed with Joyce that researchers are not sure whether the Aztecs dispersed ashes or made any special arrangements for their leaders at all. \u201cIt is not surprising that these cremains have not yet been found or identified,\u201d Gillespie told the AP. \u201cArchaeologists don\u2019t quite know what they\u2019re looking for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
