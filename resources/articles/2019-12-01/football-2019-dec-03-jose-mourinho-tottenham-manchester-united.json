Actually, there has not been a press briefing during his short time at Tottenham when he has failed to do so. Yes, the manager is starring in an Amazon Prime documentary about the club\u2019s season. Mourinho was at it again on Tuesday morning, as he previewed Wednesday night\u2019s visit to his former club Manchester United, which, incidentally, will be carried live by Amazon Prime. Turning his head down and towards the inside of his collar and the ever-present mic, he mentioned the US company and had a bit of fun speaking directly to them. There would be a twist. \u201cI\u2019m also doing an episode for Netflix,\u201d Mourinho said, before detailing his involvement in a sports documentary for Amazon\u2019s great rival. \u201cThere are eight coaches from eight different sports, I\u2019ve filmed it already. I don\u2019t know when it comes out.\u201d Cue the mock conspiratorial flourish. \u201cBut Amazon guys, they cannot know.\u201d It was classic Mourinho, an example of his adherence to the have\u2011cake\u2011and\u2011eat\u2011it model. In Amazon\u2019s big week of Premier League football here was one of its poster boys jumping into bed with the enemy. But do not call it a mis-step, because Mourinho was in no danger of making a blunder. On the eve of his Old Trafford return, he went to great lengths to ensure there was not so much as a syllable out of place when it came to United \u2013 the club he left last December under storm clouds. It was easy to imagine what Mourinho might have wanted to say, starting with Paul Pogba, United\u2019s \u00a389m player who he found so difficult to manage, particularly after the France midfielder reported for last season as a World Cup winner. Or how about the record of his successor, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, who has taken 26 points from 22 league games since being confirmed in the job on a permanent basis? Mourinho\u2019s last 22 matches at United brought 35 points. Then there is Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman with whom he clashed over recruitment. Mourinho has not disparaged United and he was not about to do so before the game. On the contrary. His relationship with United fans is strong \u2013 they sang his name when he went back to Old Trafford as a TV pundit, which \u201chumbled\u201d him. Mourinho wanted to make it clear he enjoyed good friendships with many of the club\u2019s staff \u2013 from Woodward and the director Richard Arnold to the chef, who \u201ccalls me to ask how I am\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve had this at every club \u2013 at Christmas, on the phone will be Ed Woodward, Florentino P\u00e9rez, Massimo Moratti, Pinto da Costa,\u201d Mourinho said, bringing in the presidents of Real Madrid, Internazionale and Porto respectively, although overlooking Roman Abramovich of Chelsea. \u201cYou have relations with people and this is very important.\u201d Mourinho described United as a \u201cclosed chapter\u201d, an experience that is \u201cin my history book\u201d. He wanted to speak only about the club as an opponent. \u201cI\u2019m not a villain, I\u2019m not an enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the coach trying to win against United \u2013 that\u2019s how the United fans are going to look at me.\u201d For Mourinho it always comes down to trophies. \u201cMr Mandela said you never lose, you win or you learn,\u201d he said. \u201cAt United, I won and I learned.\u201d He did not go into specifics as to what he had learned, other than to say he and his assistants had not looked to blame anyone other than themselves for how it ended, but he was happy to remember the trophies. \u201cI have a couple of pictures of my time at United in my office at Spurs,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cOne with the Europa League trophy and my son in Stockholm [where the final was played] and one with the Carabao Cup, when you get the cup at the top of Wembley.\u201d Mourinho feels he is a \u201cbetter coach now than when I was there\u201dand he continues to whisper sweet nothings into the ears of his Spurs players. He said he is \u201cin love with\u201d Son Heung-min and Dele Alli could achieve \u201canything he wants\u201d. The contract rebels, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen, are \u201cgreat professionals\u201d. This is what Mourinho does in the early stages. From leading players down to the ballboys, it is about bolstering belief, instilling a shared sense of purpose. Spurs go to United brimming with confidence after three wins out of three for Mourinho, who is projecting an image of total happiness. Not that he was unhappy in Manchester, where he lived in an apartment at the Lowry hotel \u2013 a subject of no little lampoonery. \u201cI would be unhappy if I was in a house on my own,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI would have to clean; I don\u2019t want. I would have to iron; I don\u2019t know how to. I have to cook \u2026 I would cook fried eggs and sausages \u2013 that\u2019s the only thing I can do. I lived in an amazing apartment \u2013 a flat with \u2018bring me a latte, please\u2019, or \u2018I don\u2019t want to go down for dinner, bring my dinner up\u2019. I had everything. I was more than fine.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
