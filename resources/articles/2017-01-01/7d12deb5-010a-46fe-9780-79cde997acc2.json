While some Republicans distanced themselves from the assertion, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood by it during Tuesday\u2019s press briefing but was vague on the possibility of an investigation into the supposed crime. Asked if the president believes that millions voted illegally in the election, Spicer replied: \u201cThe president does believe that. He has stated that before. I think he stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented him.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that he intended to launch a \u201cmajor investigation into voter fraud\u201d. However, he cited improper voter registration as the focus of the investigation and did not state a desire to review the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....,\u201d he wrote in a first tweet, adding in a second: \u201ceven, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!\u201d The controversy reignited on Monday night when Trump, who won in the electoral college but lost the popular vote, reiterated his view to congressional leaders that millions voted illegally, according to reports. He was criticised by Democrats and some Republicans. But Spicer, who has the unenviable job of publicly defending Trump\u2019s spur-of-the-moment comments and tweets, insisted: \u201cAs I said, I think the president has believed that for a while based on studies and information he has.\u201d Pressed further, Spicer said it was \u201ca longstanding belief\u201d of Trump\u2019s. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve heard this concern of his. I think there have been studies. There was one that came out in 2008 that showed 14% of people who had voted were non-citizens. There are other studies that have been presented to him. It\u2019s a belief that he maintains.\u201d The press secretary appeared to be referring to a Washington Post article by the political scientists Jesse Richman and David Earnest which, drawing on the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, argued that more than 14% of non-citizens in 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote. The Washington Post\u2019s website now prefaces the article with three rebuttals, a response from the authors defending their work, and a peer-reviewed article contending that the findings \u201cwere biased and that the authors\u2019 data do not provide evidence of non-citizen voting in US elections\u201d. When pressed about whether Trump would call for an investigation into what a reporter said would be the biggest scandal in American electoral history, Spicer said: \u201cMaybe we will.\u201d He later added: \u201cAnything is possible. It\u2019s a hypothetical question.\u201d Asked what it meant for democracy, he was evasive and replied only: \u201cIt means I\u2019ve answered your question.\u201d But some members of Trump\u2019s own party were critical on Tuesday and urged the president to stop spreading baseless allegations. Lindsey Graham, senator for South Carolina, said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t there, but if the president of the United States is claiming that 3.5 million people voted illegally, that shakes confidence in our democracy \u2013 he needs to disclose why he believes that.\u201d Graham added: \u201cI would urge the president to knock this off; this is the greatest democracy on Earth, we\u2019re the leader of the free world, and people are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system without justification. This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it.\u201d The House speaker, Paul Ryan, also distanced himself from the comments. \u201cI have no way of backing that up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me. He won the election.\u201d But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, told reporters: \u201cThe notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true \u2026 It does occur, there are always arguments on both sides about how much and how frequent and all the rest, but most states have done a better job on this front.\u201d Colorado Republican Cory Gardner, who said this weekend that he had written in Mike Pence\u2019s name in lieu of Trump when voting, said there was voter fraud in the US. When pressed about whether more than 3m illegal votes had been cast, the first-term senator simply said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any evidence of that.\u201d Other Republicans simply punted. When asked about Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday morning, before the Spicer press conference, the Arizona senator John McCain said: \u201cLong ago I gave up talking about what the president talks about; my concern is what he does.\u201d In contrast, Democrats slammed the president\u2019s statement. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said: \u201cThe president ought to realise he is president. Instead of talking about the election or how many people showed up at the inauguration, he ought to talk about how many jobs he created.\u201d Schumer went on to cast blame on elected Republican senators for not condemning these comments: \u201cWhen these falsehoods are told, our Republican colleagues have an obligation to reject them, not to skirt around them. The bottom line is simple: you cannot run a government, you cannot help people, you cannot keep America safe, if you cannot admit to the facts, plain and simple.\u201d The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders simply said the president\u2019s accusation of voter fraud was a \u201cdelusional statement\u201d. Weeks after the election, Trump insisted in a tweet that he had won the popular vote \u201cif you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally\u201d. Fact-checking websites and newspapers traced the claim to a two-week-old \u201crandom tweet\u201d by a former Republican party official in Texas. Gregg Phillips claimed on 12 November to have found \u201cmore than three million votes cast by non-citizens\u201d \u2013 but he too failed to provide evidence. The topic was one Trump long harped on throughout the campaign with claims that the election was \u201crigged\u201d. In October, he insisted at a Wisconsin rally: \u201cPeople who died 10 years ago are still voting.\u201d Trump specifically claimed 1.8 million dead people would vote \u2013 and for \u201csomebody else\u201d. This appeared to be a reference to a 2012 study that found up to 1.8 million active voter registrations from deceased voters. That specific study did not provide any evidence of voter fraud or any ballots cast by the deceased. Instead, it simply illustrated that some state voter databases were out of date. Trump had also long specifically warned of voter fraud in minority communities, specifically in Philadelphia, where Barack Obama won African American neighborhoods by overwhelming majorities in 2012. In an October rally in exurban central Pennsylvania, Trump warned the almost entirely white crowd: \u201cWatch your polling booths, because I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania, certain areas. We can\u2019t lose an election because \u2013 you know what I am talking about.\u201d There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Research over the last 16 years has found voter fraud to be extremely uncommon, and 2016 appeared to follow that pattern. ProPublica election monitors saw no evidence of widespread illegal voting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
