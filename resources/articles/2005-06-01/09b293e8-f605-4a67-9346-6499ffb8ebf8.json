Sajid was penalised three times in quick succession by the umpire John Holder for an illegal follow-through and banned from the rest of the Yorkshire innings, so heaping more misery on an unproductive season in the Second Division. He returned from a modest England A tour of Sri Lanka confident that he could recapture the form that brought a one-day international cap two years ago. But he was dropped before April was out, after three wickets in two championship matches, and his reappearance over the Pennines has brought no improvement. Sajid had bowled only 5.4 overs, had disappeared for 42 runs, and generally looked as if he had taken an uppercut or two from his cousin, Amir Khan, when Holder banished him to the outfield. \"He's done us a favour,\" muttered one Lancashire sage. It beggars belief that there is still no umpiring signal that communicates why a bowler has been suspended from the attack. Yorkshire chose not to announce the reason to the crowd until they had received official notification at the tea interval, and so left the more careless observers entirely in the dark. There are still a few people who do not want a job in the communications industry - and they are all in county cricket. The stalled progress of Sajid, one of their brightest prospects, will disturb Lancashire, especially so as James Anderson has had well-documented problems since England attempts to refine his action. The England Academy director Rod Marsh and the bowling coach Troy Cooley, present on the first day, had departed, but they share Lancashire's concern. It was cloudier yesterday, but it did not swing. Yorkshire's innings was enlivened by Phil Jaques, a clean and uncluttered left-hander, who fell only three runs short of making a hundred before lunch, and then fell without addition when he edged the persistent Dominic Cork to second slip. Matthew Wood had been freakishly run out; Iain Sutcliffe missed a sharp chance from Jaques at silly mid-off but the ball flew through his hands, struck an ankle and ran out Wood at the non-striker's end. Conscientious half-centuries from Michael Lumb, with an out-of-character 68 from 172 balls, and Craig White, still undefeated on 64 when bad light ended play four overs early, edged Yorkshire to within 81 runs with three wickets left. They would not have slept easily."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
