The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped \u2013 a penalty designed to \u201cincentivise\u201d jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits \u2013 because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough. In other instances, the problem means claimants doing the same job and earning identical salaries can end up being paid different amounts of universal credit simply because their respective claims begin on different days of the month. The complication, which occurs when pay dates fall close to the start of universal credit assessment periods, can result in claimants who are parents or disabled losing up to \u00a3258 of work allowance each month, CPAG has estimated. The charity has called for universal credit to be halted in order to fix the problem before the benefit is extended to over two million people \u2013 including many families who are currently in receipt of working tax credits \u2013 from July 2019. It says erratic payments have left families stressed and in hardship: \u201cClaimants are often left flummoxed by how much \u2013 or how little \u2013 universal credit they will receive from one month to the next,\u201d said the CPAG chief executive, Alison Garnham. The problem typically affects claimants whose wages are paid on or close to the first day of their universal credit monthly assessment period, which is used to calculate how much a claimant is entitled to be paid each month. If a claimant is paid wages a day or two earlier \u2013 because their normal payday would fall on a weekend or bank holiday, for example \u2013 the system records them as having had two pay cheques in one assessment period and none in the following one. As a result, universal credit considers them to be earning more than they actually do in the first period, so automatically blocks \u201cpassported\u201d entitlements such as free prescriptions \u2013 and in the second period considers them to be earning nothing, so makes them subject to benefit-cap penalties. Claimants whose assessment period start date and payday are at the end of a month are especially prone to losing out, as this is when most bank holidays fall, says CPAG. A worker paid on the last day of each month in 2018 could expect three assessment periods with two paydays and three with no paydays. It cites the case of a working couple with two children who since claiming universal credit last year have seen monthly payments fluctuate from between \u00a31,185 to zero because of pay date and assessment period clashes. They have found it impossible to budget and are now in rent arrears for the first time in their lives. \u201cIn reality, the current monthly assessment system is a huge oversimplification which does not reflect the reality of people\u2019s lives and work,\u201d says CPAG. Although claimants often ask the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP) to change their assessment period dates to eliminate the problem, they are routinely told that nothing can be done \u2013 in one case a claimant was told that this was simply \u201cthe nature of the beast\u201d. The DWP has been much criticised for failing to act on evidence of problems in the benefit system, although last month the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, promised the DWP will be more responsive when glitches in universal credit were identified. CPAG said campaigners had warned the government about flaws in the monthly assessment period and payment cycle back in 2012 when universal credit was at the design stage but were ignored."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
