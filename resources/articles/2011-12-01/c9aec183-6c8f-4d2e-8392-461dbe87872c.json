'Tis the season to be ripped off", "bodyText": "Anyone spending more than \u00a350 on a Christmas tree must have tinsel for brains. This weekend and next are when 90% of Christmas trees will be bought. And as regular as Christmas is the annual story warning of (a) a tree shortage and (b) rising prices. Indeed, an otherwise level-headed friend bought his embarrassingly early (3 December really is too early, isn't it?), to avoid a desperate last-minute hunt for a Nordman fir. A spokesman for the British Christmas Tree Growers Association tells me that 6ft non-drop Nordman firs, now our most popular tree, are selling out fast. He blames the falling pound making imports from Denmark more expensive, and the mild weather. It seems harvesting trees is easier when it's a bit frosty. But this story is about as old as your auntie's Christmas pudding. Take this from Metro last year: \"Tree shortage to hit your Christmas as well as soaring price\". It blamed two factors: the falling pound and the weather. Last year, curiously, frost was a bad thing. I searched back further, to Christmas 2009. Sure enough, the Mail on 23 November 2009 wrote: \"Christmas tree shortage could see thousands of families missing out\". Those old culprits, the exchange rate and the Danes, were to blame again. And the Christmas before that? Once again the Mail was warning us that \"Christmas tree price set to smash the \u00a350 barrier\". You might now be able to guess why. Clue: it's got the Queen's head on it, and has been doing rather badly on the exchange markets. It's very expensive, you understand, to import them from Scandinavia now sterling is such rubbish. And it is, indeed, rubbish. We don't import the vast majority of our Christmas trees. Nearly 95% are home-grown, the majority in the northern counties of England and Scotland, but with a large number of growers in the south as well. (And by the way, you got 8.68 Danish kroner for \u00a31 a year ago, 8.71 today. Not quite a major devaluation.) Now let's go back even further, to 2007. It wasn't possible to spin the sterling story \u2013 the pound was riding high. But we had a new(ish) pantomine villain. Again, we were warned of a 25% price rise, again it was the dastardly Danes, but this time it was the fact that they grew too many, went bust, now weren't growing enough (complicated, I know). I started trailing back through the cuttings, so to speak, to 2006, and the same story kept cropping up, but my interest was dropping as fast as spruce needles in my lounge. Inside London, a 6ft Nordman fir should sell for no more than \u00a345, while outside London, don't part with more than \u00a330. Fortunately, some wholesalers give the game away by posting their prices online. The guy selling it to you on the roadside paid no more than \u00a320, and probably a fair bit less. Good luck with the haggling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
