I hope you might have found some of this useful - it\u2019s worth having a flick through Friday\u2019s blog as well, as some of those deals are still active until midnight tonight. Thanks for reading. Have a good Christmas - and I\u2019ll maybe see you here next year! Lily\u2019s Kitchen are offering 20% off absolutely everything until the end of today using the code \u2018BLACKFRIDAY\u2019, meaning it\u2019s totally acceptable to treat your cat or dog to a gourmet Christmas lunch. Made.com will run their \u2018up to 20% off and free delivery\u2019 sale until midnight tonight, including some items from their very snazzy range for pets. Pets at Home have up to 40% off dog accessories and up to 50% off cat accessories and grooming products. Importantly for any pet owner, Shark are offering their vacuum that\u2019s specifically designed for homes with pets at \u00a3179.99 (usually \u00a3299.99). And with our sustainable hat on, Yora Pet Foods are offering what they claim is the world\u2019s most sustainable dog food. Just don\u2019t tell your K-9 what is in it. Not On The High Street champion small sellers and have a refreshing take on children\u2019s gifts, with between 20-50% off in their Cyber Monday sale. You\u2019ll find personalised penguin dressing gowns (\u00a315) and bracelet making kits (\u00a313.56), and seemingly everything in between. John Lewis are ending their Black Friday event today, which includes 20% off LEGO and loads of other great deals across their toys section. Debenhams also have up to 20% off for Cyber Monday which extends to their children\u2019s toys, with over 900 products listed as part of the offer. Smyths Toys are offering special deals on all sorts of children\u2019s toys, from games consoles and bundles to \u2018Ride On Unicorns\u2019 (yes, really!). It\u2019s also worth mentioning that if you buy in-store, you\u2019ll get an additional \u00a35 off when you spend \u00a350 or more, or \u00a310 when you spend \u00a3100 or more. Other Cyber Monday toy sales include Bright Minds (up to 50% off educational children\u2019s toys), The Entertainer (up to 75% off), George at Asda (including 20% off wooden toys) and Etsy (up to 70% off). Waterstones and Foyles have up to half price off popular sellers including Jamie Oliver\u2019s \u2018Veg\u2019 and David Walliams\u2019 \u2018The Beast of Buckingham Palace\u2019 so it looks like they are fairly well matched if you are looking for a good deal on books this Cyber Monday. Foyles are promoting free delivery, whereas Waterstones are only offering free delivery on all orders over \u00a320. But on the other hand, if you missed the hype, Waterstones have 50% off Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u2018The Testaments\u2019. If you\u2019d rather listen to your literature, Audible are still running their \u201850% off for 4 months\u2019 offer for Cyber Monday, whereas it\u2019s usually \u00a37.99 per month. I should add, in an \u201cOther TV listings magazines are available\u201d kind of voice, that you can also get books from the Guardian Bookshop. Not sure what to gift someone as a book? My colleague Justine Jordan has just listed the best fiction of 2019. In fact we have a whole range of listings of what our critics thought were the best books of the year in various genre - and this selection of what the year\u2019s best writers are recommending. There\u2019s something rather quaint about the idea of Cyber Monday, which is now *checks notes* in its fifteenth year. It started in 2005, when I guess it was reasonable to assume that if you were going to do something as risky as order someone\u2019s present online, you needed to leave four weeks for it to get delivered to you. How times change. Personally, I\u2019m a bit unsure of having talking speakers in your house connected to computers somewhere else to \u201cdo things\u201d for you. On the one hand it has got the kind of Star Trek vibe that you would think would appeal to the geek in me. On the other hand, it could just be that Douglas Adams\u2019 thing: \u201cAnything invented after you\u2019re thirty-five is against the natural order of things\u201d. Certainly I find myself shouting \u201cPlay Katherine Hepburn by Sparks featuring Christi Haydon\u201d and confusing the poor thing and wondering if it wasn\u2019t just easier when I had CDs and had to get out of my chair. However, if you are in the market for smart speakers, there are some very cheap deals out there. John Lewis has lots of deals on Google Home speakers, from the Mini Hands-Free Speaker for \u00a319 (\u00a330 off) to \u00a3100 off the Max Hands-Free Smart Speaker, selling at \u00a3199 (it\u2019s the same deal at Curry\u2019s). Choose from the exciting colours of Chalk or Charcoal\u2026 If Apple is more your thing, the Homepod has \u00a350 off and is selling at \u00a3229. Curry\u2019s also has \u00a350 off the SONOS One Wireless Multi-Room Speaker, selling at \u00a3149. When it comes to headphones, Beats by Dre are still among the best-selling - Curry\u2019s (again) has the wireless version for \u00a379.99, and Apple AirPods at \u00a3138, down \u00a321. John Lewis is selling the Bose Quiet Comfort Noise Cancelling Headphones for \u00a3229, so \u00a370 off. So you\u2019ll see lots of advice around about being careful about shopping over the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend and making sure that things are genuinely a bargain. I\u2019ve just had the positive side of the experience, which is something that I needed and had been tracking the price of just dropped by 30%. Which was great news. I snapped it up, and just have to stop buying coffee before work now to fund it \ud83d\udc40 . Talking of coffee - this is such an amazing segue I should definitely be in local radio - one thing I had sent to me were these compostable Halo coffee capsules which are compatible with Nespresso machines. After you\u2019ve used them they apparently degrade completely in your compost bin or flower bed in less than 90 days. You can ditch the plastic or aluminium capsules, and the offer today appears to be 2 free packs when you order 6. Is there a stationery nerd in your life? Is it you? Papier have 20% off everything which will end at midnight tonight, including Christmas cards and gifts, like their personalised diaries, notebooks and stationery sets. If you stock up on enough stocking fillers and spend \u00a340, you\u2019ll also get free delivery. Ohh Deer are giving customers 50% off Christmas cards and wrapping paper for Cyber Monday, and they still have some offers left in their Black Friday event on advent calendars, planners and more. Paperchase are also weighing in with 25% off \u2018almost everything\u2019 until midnight. Moleskine are \u2018turning paper digital\u2019 for the day and offering up to 40% off selected lines. Right, I\u2019ve just had my lunch, I\u2019ve got food on my mind\u2026 Ethical Superstore are running 20% off groceries and everyday items, which covers their festive food (including vegan festive food) range, and Ethical Superstore will also be \u2018donating much-needed grocery items to the Newcastle West End Foodbank\u2019 with every single order over \u00a330 until midnight tonight. M&amp;S has 25% off wine cases when you buy two - for example, buy two of this \u2018Seasonal Six\u2019 case and save \u00a328.25 overall, getting 12 bottles of wine for \u00a384.75. Morrison\u2019s is offering a third off all Champagne. Meanwhile, Majestic are offering up to 50% off for \u2018one day only\u2019 when you mix 6 bottles. Honest Brew have up to 40% off beers, mixed cases and hampers, while Beer Bods have taken 50% off their gift beer subscriptions. Wine subscriptions site Savage Vines has 20% off sitewide with the code BLACK19. Not necessarily just for Cyber Monday but you can get 4 for 3 party food platters on M&amp;S, and they\u2019ve got free delivery on hampers. Sainsbury\u2019s will give you a \u00a35 Argos voucher AND a free chocolate pug from Cocoa et Co if you order a shop worth more than \u00a380. This is one is only for the super-organised which probably rules me out: select your date of pick-up for the 22, 23 or 24 December. Thinking about cutting down carbs before Christmas? No, I\u2019m not either, but just in case - low-carb aficionados Lo-Dough have some discounts today, like their Taster Kit for \u00a310. Hotel Chocolat are offering two free chocolatey gifts when you spend \u00a325 or more with them today, so you can pick up presents for sweet-toothed friends (chocolate penguin anyone?) and sort out your post-roast nibbles at the same time. One absolute \u201cUrgh!\u201d of Black Friday is I\u2019ve just seen some stats about the increased number of flights sold over the weekend. No thank you. Instead of suggesting holidays with flights involved, here are a few flight-free options: First things first, you can save up to \u00a3200 per booking on rail holidays from The Guardian Holidays and up to 10% off Spring and Summer bookings on Guardian Cottages. Canopy and Stars aren\u2019t doing a traditional Cyber Monday discount, but they are offering an additional \u00a350 when you buy a \u00a3150 Christmas gift card. Forest Holidays offer short breaks \u2018in the UK\u2019s most beautiful forests\u2019 and they are currently running 20% off all breaks, with low deposits on selected holidays. The National Trust are offering 10% off Winter Getaways and 15% off bookings for 10 or more guests. More sustainable fashion: Rapanui are doing a \u201cbuy one get one tree\u201d offer - a reminder that you are more likely to feature on this blog if you\u2019ve got some kind of pun going for you. They are an interesting business because they say their \u201clifelong mission is to make clothing sustainable\u201d. Everything they make has a freepost coupon and a \u00a35 voucher built. When the clothes are worn out, people can send them back to get \u00a35 off their next purchase - and Rapanui then make new products from the material they recover. Gandys is another potential source of clothes and travel gear trying to have a positive effect on the world. There\u2019s up to 70% off today. Founders Rob and Paul lost their parents in the Boxing Day tsunami that hit Sri Lanka, and sales of their travel brand contribute towards building children\u2019s homes for orphans in Sri Lanka, Malawi, Brazil and Nepal. Another sustainable way of doing fashion? Make the clothes yourself. We are knitters are offering up to 40% off today, while Wool and the Gang are offering 30% off everything. Let\u2019s celebrate a strong pun game there, too. If knitting is beyond your skills, you can also find pre-knitted discounts at the Wool Room, with 40% of bedding sets, and 35% of everything else. They make the point that their products are made of 100% British wool, though I\u2019m not personally 100% convinced sheep are especially aware of the concept of the nation state. I\u2019m not a fashionable chap myself - I\u2019ve basically retained an indie uniform of black jeans, black t-shirt and black jumper since getting into Joy Division and The Cure back in 1862. I\u2019ve got a scarf with some light grey and white stripes in it, and one of my kids the other day said \u201cDad, that is the brightest colours you ever wear.\u201d You, on the other hand, may feel like something a bit more exciting, so these deals might be to your taste: Levi\u2019s are running 30% off everything today, so if you are looking for jeans for you or a loved one, they are worth a look, especially as they reduce up to 96% of the water normally used in denim finishing. Everlane are taking a different approach today, with a \u2018choose what you pay\u2019 one-day event. Across womenswear and menswear, you can choose how much of a discount you get (by the looks of things, this is up to around 40%), or whether you pay full price in the knowledge that the brand will use the money ethically. H&amp;M\u2019s Cyber Monday sale is here with up to 50% off selected items, with the offers extending to their Conscious range (which covers Womenswear and Menswear) We mentioned People Tree on Friday who pioneer in the Fair Trade fashion space, and their \u201830% off everything\u2019 sale ends this evening at midnight. COS are also offering 20% off their \u2018wardrobe staples\u2019 and free shipping. Reformation\u2019s claim is that they are the most sustainable fashion option, second to being naked - they have got a much anticipated 30% off for Cyber Monday. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve mentioned nudity in a Cyber Monday live blog, but there we go. Probably worth a reminder at this point for those of you asking \u201cWhy is the Guardian doing this?\u201d Here\u2019s the email I was sending to people on Friday when they were messaging me asking why we were covering Black Friday: \u201cHey, thanks for your email. It\u2019s maybe a fair point. Personally I know we will get a lot of traffic to the site via search for Black Friday [and Cyber Monday today], and if I can try and direct people to more sustainable and ethical choices than if they landed on a different newspaper website, then I think it is worth us doing, and providing a service to our readers. Today I\u2019m trying to be the Black Friday [and now Cyber Monday] live blog on the web that has a focus on giving, fund-raising and small sustainable businesses, rather than links to [REDACTED BIG BUISNESS] et al. Guardian readers are still going to buy gifts for loved ones, why not try and help them save money. But we keep it under review, I don\u2019t think we live blogged it last year, although I did do a summary article of deals I think, and a Cyber Monday live blog. I appreciate what you are saying though - it is something that we have thought about quite hard.\u201d Anyway, I know there will be some of you who very much disagree - but that\u2019s the thinking behind it. For those of you who\u2019d like to recommend anything in the ethical, sustainable, small business bucket, pop it in the comments or chuck me an email at martin.belam@theguardian.com and I may feature it. Put the Guardian\u2019s resident Doctor Who nerd in charge of a Cyber Monday live blog and it is inevitable that the Cybermen are going to feature. If you are a fan of Doctor Who, Big Finish have a selection of discounts on their audiobooks and dramas. You need to use the code DOCTOR20 to access the offers which includes one of the greatest ever Cybermen stories - Spare Parts - for just one of your Earth Pounds. That\u2019s about twenty Grotzits in Andromedan money. In the offer there are also some of their stories featuring the late John Hurt reprising his 50th anniversary special one-off TV appearance as the Doctor - which I always found enjoyable as it was lovely to hear him as the character again. If you are going to be baking for Christmas, the holy grail for home bakers sees some pretty decent discounting this weekend, depending on your colour preferences. Curry\u2019s may offer the best deal with \u00a3220 off the Artisan Stand Mixer with a 4.8 litre bowl, selling at \u00a3279 - hope you like the colour \u2018latte\u2019. AO offers the same deal in space grey, while you\u2019ll need to pay an extra \u00a320 for the candy apple red model at John Lewis. Robert Dyas has the 4.3L Classic in black for \u00a3249.99. To accessorize, you can pick up the Ice Cream Maker attachment for \u00a345 at Lakeland, with the flex edge beater attachment at \u00a317.50 (no need for spatulas - if you know, you know). Talking of mindfulness, it is a truth universally acknowledged that home printers are the devil\u2019s work and that trying to get them to print something is usually the very opposite of a calming yogic experience. If you are going to spend half your monthly salary on replacement ink to print out the gig ticket you opted to \u2018print at home\u2019 because it saved you \u00a31.50 on the delivery charge, you might as well do it today and get money off - there\u2019s 30% off own brand ink cartridges from the Cartridge People. Out of the things people are suggesting to me I\u2019m maybe skewed towards things for kids, as I have two at ages where they are a bit shrug shoulders and muttering \u201cI dunno, stuff\u201d when you ask them what they want for Christmas. I\u2019m not sure these would work for my two - karate is more their thing than yoga - but Super Yogis make these flash cards. Each card has a super hero theme based around yoga, with an instruction, breathing technique or exercise on the back. It does look like an interesting way to introduce 7-12 year olds to some of the concepts around mindfulness. There is a discount on them today. Sali Hughes mentioned Spectrum Brushes in her \u201840 best sustainable beauty brands\u2019 piece earlier in the year, and for Cyber Monday they are offering up to 75% off (even on stocking fillers) and free shipping on orders over \u00a330. Kiehls are running a 20% discount on all their products (including gift sets) when you buy two or more items and use the code \u2018BLACKFRIDAY\u2019. Plus, there\u2019s free shopping regardless of how much you spend and their Christmas range with festive designs is a great option for gifting. The Body Shop are also doing up to 30% off with the code \u201814664\u2019 when you spend \u00a35. They are a useful go to for awkward relatives to gift to, since everybody has to wash. There have been some questions around their ethics over the years, but they claim to remain committed to cruelty-free beauty and ethical business as part of Natura&amp;Co. Glossier, arguably the most talked about beauty brand of 2019 [it says here in my notes], are offering 20% off absolutely everything, and up to 35% off their sets. Of the larger Beauty retailers, Lookfantastic are offering 25% off your order when you use the code \u2018CYBER\u2019 and up to a 50% discount on selected items, meanwhile Beauty Bay are offering up to 50% off selected lines and Boots and Superdrug are both offering up to 50% off their \u2018Christmas Gift\u2019 edits. Treatwell falls into this category but instead of selling beauty products, they are the largest hair and beauty bookings website in Europe and they are offering up to 50% off for Cyber Monday. You can book anything from a full-blown spa treatment to an appointment to get your nails done, if that\u2019s your thing. If you do take up that Guardian Soulmates offer I just mentioned, there\u2019s a chance you might end up with kids* - in which case why not stock up in advance with Anorak magazine, which describes itself as a \u2018happy mag\u2019 for kids, is printed on recycled paper with vegetable ink, and there\u2019s 20% off today. [*Please don\u2019t ask me how this happens in the comments today] It would be remiss of me not to mention this Guardian offer. If you sign up to Guardian Soulmates today you can get 50% off, potentially meet the love of your life, and then apply to be in our \u2018how we met\u2019 column, citing this live blog - or should I say love blog? - as the cause. And\u2026I\u2019m back. It isn\u2019t a Cyber Monday offer, but I noticed during my commute that the FA are advertising that if you buy your tickets for England\u2019s friendly with Denmark next year before 13 December, you\u2019ll get a Christmas card from Gareth Southgate. A Christmas card from Gareth Southgate. I can\u2019t stop laughing. Anyways, as I\u2019ve mentioned, we are trying to do Black Friday/Cyber Monday/Whatsitsname Tuesday live blogs with a difference here at the Guardian this year, so here\u2019s some advice from Madeleine Sugden on how, if you are cursed with having to do secret Santa in the office, you can do it in a way that doesn\u2019t just mean swapping loads of plastic tat: Be a good Secret Santa 2019 Right, so far I\u2019ve been doing this from home in between chucking corn flakes at the kids and shouting \u201cBrush your teeth!\u201d every two minutes, but I\u2019m now going to make the mad dash from Walthamstow into the Guardian offices. Yes, of course I will be listening to East 17\u2019s \u201cStay Another Day\u201d on repeat on the commute, as is the law around these parts at this time of year. Don\u2019t forget to email me - martin.belam@theguardian.com - if you\u2019d like to suggest small, sustainable and ethical businesses who have special offers on today, and I\u2019ll be carrying this blog on in about an hour\u2019s time. See you then. Peloton have taken \u00a3209 off their Works Package, with free accessories - though that is still a hefty investment at \u00a31,990. Powerhouse Fitness have a BodyMax B2 Indoor Exercise Bike and H2Row Rowing Machine for 51% off at \u00a3548.98. The Life Fitness T3 Treadmill has \u00a3500 off on John Lewis. On the bike front, Evans Cycles has 20% off Pinnacle hybrid bikes and 40% off Cannondale road bikes. They\u2019ve also branded the whole thing \u201cBlack Rideay\u201d which appeals to my sense of pun mischief. Halfords has a 20% discount on adult bikes and kids\u2019 bikes, not to mention some car cleaning gift sets if you\u2019re in the market for such a thing - maybe one for the Alan Partridge in your life. Argos has \u00a320 off selected Fitbits. Adidas has up to 65% off products today, and My Protein has 45% off everything. You\u2019d think that John Lewis would have to put prices up to pay for their Christmas ads, but they are offering a big range of discounts on brands with offers that end today. They include 15% off Sonos gear, 40% off Emma Mattresses, 30% off Le Creuset, 20% off UGG, and you can Save \u00a3100 on a Dyson V11 although you have to be careful it doesn\u2019t relocate to Singapore after having promised you that everything here is going to be wonderful. All the John Lewis deals are here. If cameras are your thing, then Canon are offering a puntastic Double Cashblack deal for all of Black Friday weekend, an offer that runs out at the end of tonight. You can get \u00a3160 \u201ccashblack\u201d on an EOS 77D, or \u00a3100 \u201ccashblack\u201d on an EOS 250D. There\u2019s also \u201ccashblack\u201d on a load of lenses and accessories. Please note that I do love a terrible pun, and if you spot an offer featuring one let me know straight away - martin.belam@theguardian.com If you were looking to splash some cash on gadgets today, then going direct to Microsoft is a good bet for deals on the XBox of their Surface Pro range. Save up to \u00a370 on Xbox One S consoles Save \u00a3150 on Xbox One X Save up to \u00a3375 on Surface Pro 7 + Type Cover bundle Save up to \u00a3240 on Surface Pro 7 Save up to \u00a3247 on Surface Pro 7 for Business plus Type Cover bundles I made it a running joke on Black Friday reminding you (i.e. myself) not to buy loved ones a vacuum cleaner for Christmas, regardless of how much of a discount was on it. Where I have had some gifting success in the past was in getting my other half things purporting to come from the kids, which had been personalised with pictures of them. Other printing companies are available, but Vistaprint are offering up to 60% off today. As I mentioned in the preamble, I\u2019m actually more interested in promoting sustainable small businesses that have got special offers on at the moment. On Black Friday we mentioned various things that caught my eye, like the kind of things you find on Not On The High Street. There are also companies doing the whole early December sale thing in a totally different way. Lucy &amp; Yak, for example, are offering donations to Fior Di Loto with every purchase to send girls to school. And fashion brand Pomp are among a host of people offering \u201cBuy one, get one tree\u201d supporting tree planting around the planet. So if you are a smaller, sustainable, ethical business, please do get in touch with me via email and I may feature you. So, to start with some of the basics, a lot of the deals knocking around today look very similar to those that were knocking around on Black Friday - here, for examples, is what the major supermarkets are doing: Argos Cyber Monday ends on Tuesday at Argos - the deals are here. They are offering 25% off some indoor furniture, 20% off gifts including watches (do people still wear those?). There are also discounts specifically on KitchenAid products. Lidl Lidl have a page full of offers here - including on the retro Sega Mega Drive mini console which has instantly sent me into a nostalgia frenzy. Tesco Tesco were doing an in-store clearance for Black Friday, but that is over now. Waitrose There\u2019s a free bottle of champagne when you order wine from the Waitrose Cellar apparently. They are also making a big deal about having the #1 Mince Pies - although we reckoned that the M&amp;S ones were better. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here, with our live blog for Cyber Monday. A live blog for Cyber Monday, you say? Are you sure Guardian? Well, yes. There\u2019s a couple of things different about the way we do it. It\u2019s not just a long list of major retailers with affiliate links in - although full disclaimer, there will be some of that. What we did on Black Friday was try and shine a spotlight and some smaller and more sustainable and ethical businesses, gently steering you towards buying Christmas gifts from loved ones that aren\u2019t going to ravage the planet to quite the same extent. And we try to avoid recommending companies with poor labour practices, and we don\u2019t promote any offers on flights. We also included some tips to reduce the impact of your Christmas shopping on the environment. And it is full of my terrible jokes, which are worth the price of the free admission alone. Anyway, the main thing you need to know is if you email me at martin.belam@theguardian.com with suggestions of smaller, sustainable, ethical businesses with special offers on today, and there\u2019s a good chance that I will feature them\u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
