The Lloyds Bank business barometer, published today showed a drop of 47 points last month, from +26% to -21%. \"It seems that the re-emergence of concerns within the Eurozone, first seen in April's data, have had a major impact on the confidence of companies in May,\" said Lloyds. The barometer, which monitors sentiment among more than 300 companies, each with a turnover of more than \u00a31m, shows businesses are still fairly upbeat about their own prospects, although confidence levels are slipping back. The Lloyds data shows broad based declines in an index which measures economic prospects, trading prospects, employment prospects and profit margins across all sectors and regions, with the most notable declines in the North and Midlands and in the retail and distribution sectors. Nevertheless, overall sentiment remains better than at the time of the 2008/09 financial crisis and ahead of pre-Christmas 2011 levels. Lloyd's economists expect an \"underlying\" 0.2% growth in GDP for the second quarter of 2012, once the effect of the Diamond jubilee \u2013 which may result in a reduced quarterly growth of about 0.5 percentage points \u2013 is taken into account."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
