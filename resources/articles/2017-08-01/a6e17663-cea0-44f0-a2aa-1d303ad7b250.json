The comedian and author warned \u201cwe are in danger of losing something of real value in our culture\u201d, pointing to shows now regarded as British television classics such as Dad\u2019s Army, Fawlty Towers and Only Fools &amp; Horses. Elton argued that, \u201ca great and original television art form is dying \u2026 it really is\u201d and said that \u201conce the studios and the talent base that support it are lost\u201d they \u201cwill never come again\u201d. Giving the inaugural BBC Ronnie Barker Comedy Lecture, Elton said that because sitcoms require lots of people to make them, as they are recorded live like a theatre show, if they are not given a chance beyond a first series they will die out. He explained: \u201cAll that [effort] makes these shows very, very expensive. An expense that frankly is easy to duck if you\u2019re just going to get slagged off for doing it anyway. \u201cWhile there\u2019s nothing we can do about shrinking budgets, fractured audiences and TV companies turning their precious facilities into prime real estate, it might help if commentator, critic and columnist alike stopped treating studio sitcoms with such thoughtless contempt.\u201d He blamed sitcoms\u2019 demise on class, critics who dislike background laughter as it means a value judgment has already been made, and the misconception that the laughter is canned. \u201cThe principal objection to these comedies is that people are laughing. Why is that? I think it\u2019s because we\u2019re British. \u201cThe laughter is evidence of effort. The terrible British sin of \u2018going for laughs\u2019. Laughs which are clear evidence of the greatest comedic crime of all, the crime of \u2018trying to be funny\u2019.\u201d He said he did not think his hit 1980s show The Young Ones, starring Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, would \u201csurvive in today\u2019s critical environment \u2026 had Rick, Vyvyan, Neil and Mike arrived in a world of instant opinions, formed and tweeted while a show is actually still on air I don\u2019t think they\u2019d have been given the grace to grow on people as they did.\u201d He said a \u201csea change\u201d in the 1990s after the success of \u201cinnovative\u201d single camera, non-audience comedies such as The Royle Family and The Office led to the studio sitcom becoming \u201covernight a by-word for critical contempt\u201d. Highlighting shows such as Absolutely Fabulous, he said: \u201cThe country\u2019s biggest popular comic hits have always been accompanied by laughter. They form an abiding and affectionate collective memory. They are part of what it means to be British. And yet \u2026 the form is routinely dismissed and often despised. \u201cIt really is a sort of snobbery and I say that reluctantly \u2026 but I make the charge none the less because I think we are discussing nothing less than a prejudice against joy. Corrosive, destructive and coloured I\u2019m afraid by that ancient British cultural cancer \u2013 class.\u201d Elton admitted a vested interest as he writes sitcoms such as Upstart Crow, the BBC Shakespearean sitcom starring David Mitchell, which is returning for a second series, but defended other sitcoms given a pasting by some critics, such as Miranda and Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys. \u201cI\u2019d plea that when we write about comedy, be it in a newspaper or in a tweet, we shouldn\u2019t leap to judgment. I don\u2019t think any comedy should be judged on its first outing, particularly a sitcom which by its nature is designed for the long haul.\u201d Elton revealed Barker told him to his face at a BBC party that he didn\u2019t like his comedic style when they first met, although they became friends later, but thought he would approve of his arguments about sitcoms: \u201cIt is not a tired and cheesy format at all. It is a great popular art form, a truly original television art form. A form which I suggest has created a community of audience, a collective affection and a store of shared memories which is unparalleled in our culture.\u201d The Ronnie Barker Comedy Lecture airs on BBC1 on Friday 25 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
