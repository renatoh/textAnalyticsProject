She had decided to study to change the direction of her career. \"I left school at 16, and did a two-year college course to become a farm secretary. My first job was doing the accounts and driving a tractor. I got married and had my daughter 13 years ago. I was out of the employment market for five years.\" After a year studying computers at her local FE college, Denley-Currie began a foundation degree at Bedfordshire University's Luton campus. She upgraded her course in 2006 to a BSc honours degree, again beginning in January, and will complete it this year. So why did she choose the January start? Denley-Currie explains: \"It's a case of having decided to go for it, then not wanting to wait around till September.\" Starting a course early in the year appeals to a wide cross-section of students, including late starters, career changers and returners to work. It offers flexibility - the chance to start at a more convenient time and to be part of a smaller grouping. Denley-Currie feels the smaller cohort and preparatory classes put her on an equal footing with younger, more confident, September starters. \"I was able to slot in at the same level as other students.\" Ten per cent of Bedfordshire's 3,500 full-time undergraduates are January or February starters, a number that has been steadily growing. The associate dean, Steve Kendall, explains: \"My remit is widening participation, and Bedfordshire is part of a consortium of five FE colleges. We are part of the national Aim Higher project. The main benefit of February starts is experienced by people in employment, or studying employment-related subjects on a part-time basis.\" Foundation degrees fit this profile exactly and a January or February start appeals most to people in work who regard the end of a calendar year as a time for taking stock and beginning a new direction. Demand from mature students has not been affected by the rise in tuition fees, as such students tend to have savings and are motivated by long-term career planning. Middlesex University introduced February starts 10 years ago and now attracts students from across the UK and increasingly from overseas. Mike Dawney, director of British Isles recruitment at Middlesex University, says: \"We have found our UK numbers of February starters have stabilised at 400-500 a year, while overseas numbers have continued to rise. The most popular subjects with these students are sociology, criminology, publishing, media and journalism - all vocationally oriented.\" Daniel Moran, 21, studying for a BA in publishing and media, began his Middlesex degree last January. Moran felt he needed a pause between school and university. \"When I was studying for my A-levels, I wasn't sure what I wanted to pursue. I needed extra time to make up my mind.\" He chose media, and started in January among a cohort of 60. He is benefiting from being in a very mixed group. \"A lot of the people I have started with are quite a lot older, and there are a lot of overseas students. I have met people from Sweden, Germany, Sri Lanka and lots of other places. It's a very international cohort and I'm getting a much broader insight into the global publishing industry.\" Overseas postgraduate students like the February start. Many come from countries with an academic year that begins in January and it gives the university more time to sort out their visa applications. Manchester Metropolitan University's business school sees most February starts on its master's degrees in professional accounting, business information systems and HR management. Five per cent of the 1,100 students taking MScs start in February. Professor Huw Morris, dean of the business school, believes the early-year start gives students more time to complete the course reading and attend acclimatisation sessions. He says: \"The February start is ideal for arts graduates reorienting themselves with a business studies diploma or postgraduate degree, even for people returning to work. Typically, someone coming on to one of these cohorts will be starting a new career, and may have moved home or even changed their employer. We try to be flexible enough to meet their needs.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
