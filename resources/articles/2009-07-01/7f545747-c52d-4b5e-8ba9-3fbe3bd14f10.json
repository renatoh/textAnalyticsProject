Main will no longer sit as the NTF's representative on the British Horseracing Authority's Veterinary Committee and will also lose his position on the BHA's Counter Analysis Committee. The BHA banned Henderson from making entries for three months and fined the trainer \u00a340,000 after he asked Main to administer tranexamic acid (TA), an anti-bleeding drug, to his mare Moonlit Path before a race at Huntingdon in February. The panel that found Henderson in breach of the rules expressed regret that Main had refused to attend the hearing, suggesting that he had \"potentially crucial evidence to give\". \"James Main tendered his resignation when the case first came to light,\" Rupert Arnold, the NTF's chief executive, said yesterday, \"and we decided it was fairest to see what the outcome of the case was, but once the decision of the panel was announced, the Veterinary Committee of the NTF accepted his resignation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
