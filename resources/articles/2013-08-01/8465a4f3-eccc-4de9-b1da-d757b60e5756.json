The government announced this year that it is replacing the complex assortment of state pensions and top-ups with a single payment worth around \u00a3144 a week in today's money. This flat-rate \"single-tier pension\" will take effect in April 2016, and will affect those who reach state pension age from that date onwards. About 20 million workers, mainly employed in the private sector, are contracted into the state second pension, one of the schemes being abolished, and the TUC said the \"vast majority\" of these people will receive less when they retire as a result of the changes. A TUC report said a worker on a median income of \u00a326,000 a year with a full employment record would lose out as soon as the reforms took effect. Someone retiring in 2030 would lose \u00a329 a week and the losses would increase over time. For typical earners with 10 years of missing national insurance contributions \u2013 for example, a woman who has taken a career break to have children \u2013 the potential income losses range from \u00a33 to \u00a327 per week, depending on when they retire, the report estimates. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said it supported the single-tier pension in principle, but added that the initial rate of \u00a3144 a week was far too low. The Department for Work and Pensions said: \"Most people retiring by 2040 will be better off over the course of their retirement with the new state pension than under the current system. The flat rate will provide a fair base, set above the basic level of means test, helping people to know how much they need to save for the kind of retirement they want. \"With millions not saving enough for retirement and only one in three private sector employees having a pension at all, the government is undertaking the biggest reform to pensions in generations. The reforms have, in less than a year, seen 1.4 million people automatically enrolled into a workplace pension.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
