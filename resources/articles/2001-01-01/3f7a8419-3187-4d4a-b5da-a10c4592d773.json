My husband and I were there in September visiting friends and I am writing to recommend that you go on the night safari at the zoo. We both agree that it was the highlight of our trip to Singapore and Malaysia. We went after a particularly heavy downpour and it felt like we had the place to ourselves. The sound of the bullfrogs was magical. Do take the train to Kuala Lumpur from Singapore too. We did the return journey by bus and travelling by road means that you miss the beautiful scenery experienced by rail. Our train was four hours late, however, as in places there's only a single track. Be warned too that the air-conditioning can be rather cold! Good luck with the rest of your travels. Those of us stuck in a rather drab (and cold) winter are very envious!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
