Tim Collins: It is very easy to apply hindsight. I think if you do that, we can't kid ourselves or anyone else that Railtrack turned out in the way that we hoped or expected. There are lots of reasons for that, and some of them are to do with circumstances that were not under anybody's control. Some were to do with a deliberate campaign of sabotage from the incoming Labour government, but also it was not the appropriate model, and it didn't have the appropriate people in charge of it. Even in a year there seems to have been a considerable shift amongst many rail observers towards the view that bad though Railtrack was bad, Network Rail seems at the moment to be even worse. If privatisation had got a very bad name by the first couple of years of the 21st century, renationalisation is not proving a great success either. TH: Do you think there is a process of creeping nationalisation? TC: There is something going on there. There is no doubt that the role of the state has increased greatly. In financial terms because we've moved from an industry which was intended to be - and in the first few years post-privatisation arguably was - largely financially independent of the taxpayer to an industry now that's consuming more public money than it was in its last few years as British Rail. There's also a huge increase in bureaucracy. One of the most striking phenomena I think, is that the Strategic Rail Authority [SRA], which was set up not to run the whole thing but just to provide long-term guidance, will very shortly have more people working for it in central London than British Rail had when it ran the whole caboodle. I would argue that at the moment we have the worst of both worlds. You neither have the clear democratic accountability that comes from a clearly nationalised industry - I would defy anyone to name more than 20% of the members of the SRA or have any idea of how they came to be there and in what sense they're accountable. The Network Rail accounts, as the public accounts committee has already said, are not properly adjusted for in Gordon Brown's borrowing figures, even though it is clearly a public sector body. Yet on the other hand you haven't got the private sector financial disciplines, the private sector incentive to innovate, or the private sector ability of managers to manage. You have actually got a sort of mushy, unsuccessful halfway house, which probably has the sins of both privatisation and nationalisation and very little of the merits of either. TH: Would you seek to abolish the SRA in its present form? TC: There is a role for having an SRA. But I think it is, for the reasons I touched on earlier, proving too interventionist, too bureaucratic, too centralist. And we'd want to see it returning much more to the original concept that the present government set out for it - that it should be providing a light-touch regulatory sense of direction over a 10 or 20-year planning period, it shouldn't be getting into the nitty-gritty of specifying how often the loo seats are up on a commuter train. TH: How would you seek to drag back the SRA? TC: Well you have a number of tools. Clearly an incoming government, by virtue of being an incoming government, means a fresh start. You have an opportunity to revise the way people operate, you set different sets of objectives. I'm not one of those who takes the view that the public sector (in terms of public servants) needs to dramatically change because a government has changed colour ... I'm confident that the majority of the people within the SRA, if they're given a clear and different sense of direction, will pursue that. But obviously there are other tools available to you as well, not least the cash controls you impose on all organisations like the SRA. And, given that I'm told the SRA is about to burst out of its original administrative building in central London and will have to take over another building at least as large to accommodate its huge increase in staff, I think one of the issues we will want to look at very, very carefully indeed are its administrative budget and the number of people it employs. And I think if we bare down very hard on both of those, that will provide a further very clear signal that they need to get back to their original role rather than perhaps some of the empire-building ambitions that they've been pursuing more recently. TH: Would you privatise Network Rail? TC: We said last year, and this remains our policy, that we can't return to Railtrack ... We do, however, have continuing question marks over the way Railtrack is accounted for, and the way that it is made accountable. It is not at the moment properly accounted for on the public sector's books, that I think is something which is going to be increasingly unsustainable and increasingly difficult to justify. Nor are we comfortable with the way is made accountable to the public. You have got this rather strange nebulous collection of the politically correct great and good on Network Rail's governing board. You have then also got its ambiguous relationship with the SRA. Then you have got the role of the secretary of state. I think we want to streamline all that. And the final thing I would say in this context is we will be bringing forward more detailed proposals before the election but our initial view which is strengthened by the fact that many people in the rail industry themselves take this view too, that having the SRA, Network Rail and the Office of the Rail Regulator - three public sector bodies - is probably one to many, and there is a case for merging two of them together. TH: The obvious two would be the SRA and the Office of the Rail Regulator? TC: Well, possibly. The interesting thing is that the train companies would say to you that they would like the Rail Regulator Office to stay independent of the SRA because it is a balancing act with the some of the negotiations they have over track access charges. We would want to look at that. There is a case for possibly merging the SRA with Network Rail - Network Rail is for all intents and purposes a wholly owned subsidiary of the SRA. I think we want to move from having three bodies to two bodies. TH: In terms of the rail operator, would you cut off the public money that seems to underpin some of them? TC: The biggest crisis facing the rail industry at the moment is the absence of financial discipline on Network Rail, and the fact that this has produced an explosion of costs which can only be met by two things, neither of which is particularly desirable. One is a huge increase in taxpayer support, not for improving the rail network, but simply to continue funding the rail network as it is now. And simultaneously you are also seeing the SRA having to cut back a huge number both of future investment projects and current provision in order to try to plug this ever-deepening black hole at the heart of its finances. The most important challenge is bring financial discipline back to Network Rail. Now, given that we have said we don't want to privatise it, you have got to look at other instruments for doing that. If you address the financial accounting problem, I would be the last person to say that the accounting practices of all government departments are models but even if you were simply going to bring Network Rail back, in the first instance, up to the standards of financial probity that an average government department has you would be making a major leap forward from where we are at the moment. The second thing we will want to look at is the background of some of the people who are seriously involved with Network Rail. There is always a case with the rail industry - senior figures will say this to you as they have to me - that it swings across the years from periods where you have engineers in charge and they spend money like water, to periods when you have accountants in charge and they don't spend any money at all. And, as in most things, the sensible place you want to be is somewhere in the middle. But post-Hatfield, post-Potters Bar and post-Railtrack you've actually got a world where the engineer is so dominant in terms of being king that the engineer can go in to a manager and say this needs to be done, and if they cap that by saying this needs to be done on health and safety grounds the manager will just role over and say that's fine, go ahead and do it. Now no organisation can sensibly operate on that procedure for long, and you've actually got to improve the financial management in Network Rail. And that's something we want to look at very, very carefully ... TH: How do you think you would get on with Bob Crow? TC: I haven't met him, I'm very happy to meet him. With at least some union leaders I suspect, paradoxically, their relationship might be better with a Tory government than a Labour one. There would be no illusions and I would hope we would be less prone to spin and more in a position to be straight with people. And having had years and years when they have been fobbed off with consultations, and now this public services forum, I suspect that if we were pretty straightforward with them there is the potential that we would have a better relationship. There is no ideological baggage, there is no sense that we're coming from part of the same movement and that one of us is an apostate and one of us is staying with the true faith. If you look within the Christian religion its often much easier for a Protestant sect to get on with Catholics than it is for them to get on with a different Protestant sect. It is easier for you to do deals with people you know are different than people who you expect to be the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
