The Royal College of Midwives has spoken out after the assembly rejected proposed guidelines on terminations at the end of last year, leaving no legal framework to support the procedure. This also means that health workers opposed to abortion have no legal right to object. The dismissal of the guidance, ordered under a court of appeal ruling in 2006, was led by the fiercely anti-abortion Democratic Unionist party, leaving Northern Ireland as the only part of the UK were the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply. The issue is highly sensitive, with clinics which give abortion information to pregnant women picketed regularly and hate mail sent to those working in the field. Breedagh Hughes, of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) in Northern Ireland, said her 1,300 members were in a state of fear: \"They are in an invidious position on two fronts. Firstly, those midwives who oppose abortion have no rights under law to conscientious objection. Under the 1967 act they do have that right. \"Perhaps more serious still is that any of our members in Northern Ireland who take part in terminations are vulnerable to criminal prosecution. As things stand any woman who in the future regretted a termination could come back at the medical team that carried out that abortion. She could in the current circumstances have that medical team charged under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. They could face criminal charges.\" Hughes said the number of terminations in Northern Ireland hospitals was far higher than the official figure of about 80 a year. Emergency terminations are allowed if a woman's life is in immediate danger. \"Those figures are nonsensical. From anecdotal evidence through our members, the numbers are far, far higher.\" She said most of Northern Ireland's terminations took place at about 20 weeks, which is when severe abnormalities would show up in a scan. \"These women are in no fit condition to travel to England and have an abortion there. They have to have the termination here.\" The British Medical Association supports the extension of the 1967 act to Northern Ireland, although the Northern Ireland branch has no position on the issue and would not discuss it. The Family Planning Association in south Belfast is one of the organisations targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Precious Life. Before moving out of the city's university area, the FPA faced daily pickets outside its front door. Dr Audrey Simpson, the FPA's director in Northern Ireland, sympathises with the midwives, saying they were \"damned either way\". She criticised the local BMA for failing to take a stance on the question. \"Even in the Irish Republic there are pro-choice forums among doctors, and that is in a society where abortion is completely illegal.\" She said whether a woman had to travel to Britain or was allowed an emergency abortion in Northern Ireland depended entirely on arbitrary decisions by individual doctors. \"We dealt with a case last year where a woman was told that if she went ahead with her pregnancy she might go blind. She had a complex medical condition. She was refused an emergency abortion here because doctors said the threat to her was only a probability. The minister's guidelines would have not only protected midwives, but also helped women like her. She in the end had to travel to England even though she was in a very distressed state.\" Michael McGimpsey, the Northern Ireland health minister, said that redrafted guidelines would be drawn up and put to the Stormont health committee in the first half of this year. Backstory Although Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply, a limited number of abortions are carried out there every year. Successive British governments have refused to use their executive power and extend the act to Northern Ireland. All political parties represented at Stormont oppose extending the act. Only one party, the UVF-linked Progressive Unionist party, has a pro-choice policy. An estimated 1,500 women from Northern Ireland travel to England each year for abortions at a minimum cost of \u00a3450 Both the Catholic church and the Free Presbyterians oppose abortion in all circumstances. Under the Bourne judgment of 1938, legal abortions take place in cases where the woman's mental or physical health is deemed at risk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
