With some calm restored across the Channel, but few signs of green shoots in the economy, he will have to strike a careful balance between guarded optimism and explaining to voters why they must face at least another five years of austerity. Spending Osborne is unlikely to touch overall spending totals: he has repeatedly said there will be no \"unfunded giveaways\". Instead, he will stick with his plan for eliminating the structural budget deficit by 2016-17 (put back a year in November's autumn statement). Child benefit Ministers right up to David Cameron have expressed concern about the \"cliff edge\" facing single-earner families with an income just above \u00a342,000 top rate threshold when they lose their child benefit next year. The Treasury is expected to throw money at easing this transition \u2013 perhaps by phasing it over time, or raising the level at which the benefit is lost. Personal allowance Lifting the personal income tax allowance, which was written into the coalition agreement, has become the government's central tax-cutting aspiration. Expect Osborne to take another step towards the Lib Dems' target of \u00a310,000, from \u00a38,105 in 2013. Taxation The 50p top tax rate looks set for the chop, though it appears likely to be phased out slowly rather than slashed to 40p immediately. More interesting will be precisely what the LibDems have managed to extract in return. Soaking the rich? Osborne's expected to announce a new tax raid on the wealthy, perhaps by limiting how much they can claim in tax reliefs: recent research for the TUC suggested that people who pay the 50p rate - ie those who earn over \u00a3150,000 - are able to claim on average \u00a315,000 a year in tax relief, on their pensions, charitable contributions and so on. This may be badged as a \"tycoon tax\", though some LibDems have already questioned whether it will be strong enough to merit the term. Any mention of a \"mansion tax\" - even rebranded with a more Tory-friendly name - would be a big win for the LibDems. Extra help for business Headline corporation tax is already set to decline steadily over the next few years, but business groups have been calling for targeted measures to boost investment \u2013 bigger capital allowances to help them write off the cost of equipment, for example. Hopes of an economic recovery depend heavily on improved business investment, so the chancellor may offer some support. Childcare Anti-poverty groups and think-tanks have increasingly argued that cutting the cost of childcare is crucial to allowing women to enter the workforce; Unemployment Rising unemployment has become increasingly controversial, with women, older workers and the young all hit hard. Look out for rhetoric suggesting the chancellor feels their pain, and perhaps some modest (ie cheap) new measures to help, such as an extension of the government's Youth Contract scheme for under-25s. Ed Miliband's punchlines Pity poor Ed M, who has to respond to Osborne's speech: it is parliamentary convention that the opposition leader, instead of the shadow chancellor, gets the job, and it's a tough gig, since the chancellor holds all the cards. Watch out for gags about robbing the poor to pay the rich \u2013 and listen for whether they fall flat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
