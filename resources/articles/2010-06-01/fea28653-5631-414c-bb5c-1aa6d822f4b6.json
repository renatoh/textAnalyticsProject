At the time of the last budget in March, former chancellor Alistair Darling suggested that GDP would grow by between 3% and 3.5% next year, but the OBR could cut that figure to as low as 2%, according to City economists. Growth forecasts for 2012 and 2013 of about 3.5% are also expected to be reined in by the OBR whose predictions will underscore the basis of the new government's emergency budget on 22 June. The OBR was set up by chancellor George Osborne to remove the temptation for government to massage figures on growth and the deficit for political ends. Forecasts were previously made by the Treasury. Headed by Sir Alan Budd, the OBR is likely to paint a gloomier picture of the underlying economy than the last government. It will give Osborne ammunition for plans to launch the biggest austerity drive since the early 1980s. Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics said: \"While the near-term outlook for the public finances may have improved a bit, it should be said that if the OBR reduces its profile for growth broadly [as expected] \u2026 it would point to a possible rise in annual borrowings by 2015 of some \u00a325bn.\" Malcolm Barr at US broker JP Morgan is predicting that the OBR's views will mean \"heightened spending restraint and an increase in VAT \u2013 our best estimate is a rate of 20% from January 2011.\" But the danger that deep spending cuts and growing unemployment could further damage Britain's growth prospects has sparked a warning from accountancy firm BDO. It said it was \"important for the government to tread a path between acting tough to cut the deficit while reassuring businesses that it is committed to restoring strong, private sector led economic growth.\" Britain's leading employers' organisation warned today that the economy's sluggish recovery from its deepest and longest post-war recession will see unemployment rise and consumer spending squeezed. In its quarterly health check, the CBI said that a temporary pick-up in the pace of growth this spring would fade as cuts in public spending start to bite. Its forecasts came as the Bank of England said the downturn of 2008 and 2009 had caused permanent \u2013 but unquantifiable \u2013 damage to the supply capacity of the economy, which was reflected in the combination of weak growth and higher than anticipated inflation. The CBI said it had nudged up its forecast of growth in 2010 from 1% to 1.3% following signs that UK manufacturers were enjoying a boost from stronger export orders. But it predicted that the pace of expansion would slacken in the second half of the year, with the jobless total climbing to 2.7 million by early 2011 and falling slowly thereafter. Richard Lambert, CBI director-general, said: \"Over the last three months the political and economic backdrop at home and abroad has shifted dramatically. Turbulence has returned to global financial markets as concerns about European sovereign debts have intensified, underlining the need for the UK to tackle its large budget deficit urgently.\" Despite the turmoil in the eurozone, the main overseas market for UK goods, the CBI estimates that exports will grow by 5.3% in 2010 and 6.9% in 2011. Net trade is expected to make a positive contribution to quarterly GDP growth rates through to the end of 2011, offsetting the weakness in domestic demand. \"Although the risks to the economic outlook have increased, our view is that the UK's tentative recovery will be sustained. However, economic growth will be weak and we do not expect a return to pre-recession GDP levels until 2012,\" Lambert said. \"It is clear that the private sector will have to be the main driver of economic growth to offset lower government spending. It is therefore essential that next week's emergency budget creates the right conditions for businesses to drive growth and create jobs, as well as setting out bold action to repair the public finances.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
