Paramilitaries, officially on ceasefire, would break their word - and unleash a wave of devastating violence. Armed to the teeth, these private armies would reach for the gun the moment they did not get their way. And all the promises made by the respectable political parties that stand alongside them would be exposed as worthless lies. That's what critics of the Northern Ireland peace process always warned would happen. Except the menace they had in mind was the IRA and the republican movement. It was the Provos who had to be disarmed and disbanded, lest they return to their bloody ways. What the sceptics did not bank on, what few people even mentioned, were the paramilitaries of loyalism. Rare was the cry for the Ulster Volunteer Force to decommission its weapons or for the Ulster Defence Association to declare that its war was over. And yet it was these men, backed by their allies in the Orange Order - not the IRA - who over the weekend turned parts of Belfast into what one loyalist politician described to me yesterday as \"Beirut\". And this was no mere street riot, no outbreak of simple stone-throwing and window-shattering. The loyalist hardmen trained machine guns on soldiers and police, sending some 700 bullets their way according to one estimate. Bricks and petrol bombs came in numbers too large to count. One eyewitness spoke of a mayhem unseen in 30 years. The chief constable of Northern Ireland, Sir Hugh Orde, had no doubt who shared responsibility for this: he had seen men swathed in the sashes of the Orange Order attacking his officers. Some suspect not a random outbreak of discontent but a deliberate, strategic move by forces within unionism. Frustrated that Ian Paisley's replacement of David Trimble as the community's leading politician had not stemmed the flow of perceived concessions to republicans, they decided to take their fight to the streets. This should shake those who have long regarded republicans as the sole obstacle to peace in Northern Ireland. In the lead-up to the 1998 Good Friday agreement, and in the years since, unionists and their cheerleaders in Westminster and the British press have piled the political and moral pressure on the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in, demanding that they change. Much of that pressure was deserved. But it was also lopsided - as this weekend's events have proved. Now we have seen, in the most lurid colours, that loyalists have guns too. The double standard looks especially glaring given the IRA's July declaration that its armed campaign is over and that it will lay down its arms. As republicanism moves into a new phase, loyalism remains in the brutal past. Just yesterday a senior UVF source was quoted saying that, yes, his group would wind up its activities - but that it would never decommission its weapons. And yet the answer to the weekend's violence is not simply to unload new pressure on loyalists and unionists. On the contrary, it seems one of the multiple causes of these disturbances is what David Ervine, leader of the loyalist Progressive Unionist party, calls a \"sense of abandonment\" among grassroots, working-class Protestants. Rightly or wrongly, he says, this community perceives a British government that bends over backwards for Sinn F\u00e9in - so that \"whatever the republicans want, republicans get\" - and does next to nothing for them. The lesson is pretty clear: the search for peace in Northern Ireland needs to be more balanced. That means spreading the pressure over arms more evenly - to include loyalists - and ensuring the rewards for progress are seen to be spread more evenly, too, to include the very same people. freedland@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
