Or so I gather from the latest roaring headlines, extrapolations and special graphs (whose dots, I like to think, are in fact tiny little illustrations of pig snouts) drawn up by what must be an increasingly frowny-faced team of health experts from the Ministry of Pandemic-Spotting And Then Trying Not To Shriek In Terror When You Find One. Our best-case scenario apparently lies somewhere between Defoe's, \"The living were not able to bury the dead\" and, \"You remember that recent remake of Terry Nation's Survivors? Well...\" I remain remarkably sanguine. This is an unexpected but highly enjoyable benefit of living most of my life at maximum anxiety capacity. When an ordinary day is filled with choking panic about skin cancer and global warming (if sunny), or roof leaks and flooding, leading to bankruptcy, homelessness and more likely both (if wet); when you rise in the morning with tears in your eyes about what you are going to do if your parents ever die (No more fish pies! No more occasional loads of washing done to help you catch up! No more highly conditional love!); and when you go to bed with a head full of lists of the domestic, professional and moral failings you have demonstrated that day, there is just not enough energy to spare for fretting over disease transmission patterns. If the brain is a computer, my worry RAM is full. Also, I find that I am increasingly distracted from the facts of the story by the increasingly visible conflict between the media's desire to milk for all it's worth the potentially most dramatic story in recent years \u2013 so much fresher than the recession and climate change, and so much more personal than all those scrabbly little wars in the dirtier corners of the world \u2013 and its vestigial nobler instincts to shepherd its flock safely through the dangers and report responsibly instead. So the rolling news channels are thick with interviews that run roughly thus: \"So, Chief Medical Officer-type person, you are still saying that the strain is not increasing in vigour?\" \"That's right, presenter fellow.\" \"But people have died?\" \"That's right. There are always a few people who die of any kind of flu.\" \"But it is the same kind of death? People are still dead \u2013 like, dead dead?\" \"Yes, but very few, though naturally it is still a tragedy for the families concerned.\" \"Yes. And do you see how we have not invited them here, even though they are probably at their most cryingest?\" \"Yes, yes \u2013 well done. Here, have a Tamiflu sweetie.\" \"Ooh, thank you!\" It's as if nobody knows that Paul Dacre is having to be nailed to his chair to stop him hopping on a tube and sneezing feverishly over people in order to get in on the ground floor of the first swine flu riot story. As if behind closed doors every BBC executive wasn't crumpling the latest memo about the disease favouring the young and telegenic, and groaning in despair: \"David, have you read this? It's attacking our target demographic and we can't even piggyback on it! Unless they come up sharpish with a vaccine that can be delivered only via Twitter, this has been the biggest waste of a story ever.\" And then they have to reach reluctantly for the Reassuring Shots Of Test Tubes And Pipettes In Cases Of Potential National Emergency file from the picture archive once more. And as if there were not secret meetings going on day and night in the bowels of ITV as they try to work out which reality show format would give the illusion of responsible reporting while best bringing in the ratings. \"OK, we inject one of Jordan's breasts with the virus and the other with the vaccine, and let them fight it out between them.\" \"Brilliant!\" Now, wash your hands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
