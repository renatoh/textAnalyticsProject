The Wall Street Journal is reporting: \"Apple Inc's unit sales of computers through US retail channels fell 6% in January from the same month in 2008, the first monthly decline in three years, according to market-research firm NPD Group.\" NPD analyst Stephen Baker said consumers are becoming more price-sensitive as the economic climate continues to worsen. \"Casual buyers or people who are trying to make a choice are trading down,\" Mr. Baker said. NPD reckons that Apple's retail market share, measured in units, fell from 16.4% to 13.7% in January 2008. \"The firm estimates that the dollar value of Apple's sales through U.S. retail channels fell 11% during the month, faster than the decline in unit sales,\" says the WSJ. However, PC sales did not suffer as badly, thanks partly to the popularity of cheap netbooks. According to the story: NPD said unit sales of all brands of PCs rose 13% in January from a year earlier, but the dollar value of systems sold fell 3.2% as consumers bought less-expensive models. Hewlett-Packard Inc had the strongest showing in the month, while the company's PC unit shipment rose to a market share of 40.1% in January compared with 39.2% a year earlier. Although Dell is a major player in the US market, its sales are still mostly direct. At retail, HP's HP and Compaq brands are much stronger, and are outselling Macs by almost 3 to 1. As Joe Wilcox has noted: \"In January, the average [US] selling price for Macs was $1,488, compared with $586 for Windows PCs.\" This is the larger context in which I suggested yesterday that it might make sense for Apple to offer a netbook, which would enable it to make some money on portables at a price point lower than $999. Apple may also come under further pressure when Windows 7 replaces Vista. Windows 7 is a very much easier, very much cheaper and far more compatible upgrade for XP users than switching to Mac OS X. Update: Writing separately, my colleague Charles Arthur has made a similar point in Should Apple make a netbook? but rather stronger than I'd put it: And there's another threat to Apple on the horizon: the upcoming Windows 7, which those who've tried it say is much more presentable and usable than Vista. If Microsoft can get Windows 7 out of the door in quick order, then the chance that Apple had to persuade people to switch from XP, or Vista, to Mac OS X will be gone. I share the view of Forrester analyst Ian Fogg that Apple has, in his words, \"missed [the] opportunity to take vast slabs of share from Vista\". He tweeted to me: \"Disagree re Netbook, it's a red herring. But Apple is missing a once in 2 decades opportunity for a step change in Mac sales.\" Fact is, when Apple could have been taking real advantage of Vista, by selling cheaper Macs in higher volumes, it charged a large premium for Macs and trousered billions of dollars instead. I don't think there's as much opportunity with Windows 7 because if you already know Windows, it's a better option than OS X."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
