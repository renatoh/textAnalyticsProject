As our colleague Richard Norton-Taylor pointed out yesterday, Whitehall's joint intelligence committee told Mr Tony Blair in February 2003 that \"al-Qaida and associated groups continued to represent by far the greatest terrorist threat to western interests, and that threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq\". That's not a bad point, as it goes, and clearly one which appealed to the PM. Five months later he was using a similar line himself, telling the intelligence and security committee: \"One of the most difficult aspects of this is that there was obviously a danger that in attacking Iraq you ended up provoking the very thing you were trying to avoid.\" What exactly did those sentences mean to the PM, we ask Downing Street? To the uneducated ear, it may appear that his view has shifted. \"We'll get back to you,\" blocks a spokeswoman. Somehow, we're not sure that she will. \u00b7 On lighter matters the Diary's very own Mystic Mug, Richard Ashworth, drops us another line with an offer to reveal what future (if any) there is for Jude Law and Sienna Miller. We'll pass on that one, we say, as even we've worked out that Jude won't be in charge of hiring the next nanny; but while you're on the line, what's your prediction for the Ashes? \"I've been looking at the pillars of the year and the winter solstice,\" he begins drearily. \"The last time the middle two pillars were of the same nature was in 1934, the year of Bodyline, and the Aussies had to change the rules of cricket to beat us.\" Er, we're not sure exactly what you're talking about, but you're wrong about the year. \"Why?\" The Bodyline series was in 1932-33 and Australia beat England over here in 1934. \"Well, you might be right about that, but anyway,\" he continues, \"I'm predicting Australia to win, but not five-nil.\" And you expect to be paid for that? \"I might need to pay you not to embarrass me,\" he pleads. Too late, old boy. Too late. \u00b7 As you'll all know by now, this column has never knowingly refused to print a Brinton story, and naturally the tradition continues. According to the Watford Observer, one Sal Brinton (surely not?), the defeated Lib Dem candidate for Watford, spent \u00a310,832 on her doomed campaign. The bill included \u00a354 on a new hairstyle on the eve of the general election. Clearly no blood relation, then. \u00b7 Another one chalked up on the list of rewards for failure, as Chris Roberts, the man who oversaw Labour's loss of a 19,313 majority at Blaenau Gwent in May, has been named as the party's new general secretary in Wales. As Jessica Morden (Labour, Newport East) comments: \"Chris ... has a fantastic sense of humour which will prove invaluable for him in his new job.\" Well, quite. \u00b7 To the Telegraph letters page, where a string of Tory MPs have put their names to a limp piece calling for the involvement of \"the grassroots members in the Conservative party's most important decisions\". If Messrs Ancram, Duncan Smith, May and Willetts really want David Davis as their leader, they should have the courage to say so. Otherwise they might want to devote their efforts to thinking up less woolly proposals to reform the leadership contest rules. Asking themselves what system might have stopped IDS would be a start. \u00b7 Finally a parochial view of Royal Mail's frequent brags of its improving delivery service. Staggering out of our flat yesterday, we were greeted by the postman. \"Don't close that door,\" he yelled from the street. \"Pop this inside.\" He then launched a package towards us from 15 yards and nonchalantly continued his round. It's the little things, as their ads say. \u00b7 diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
