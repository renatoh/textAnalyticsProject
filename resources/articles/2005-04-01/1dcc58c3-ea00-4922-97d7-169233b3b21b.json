For one thing, we don't actually smell, or even breathe, evenly through both nostrils at the same time. Dr John Prince used a kind of mask to demonstrate this. The bottom half, over the nose and below, was black, so that when you breathed out two areas on the surface misted up. This may seem a bit lo-tech, but it worked. One of the misted patches was significantly larger than the other, indicating that the breather breathed out more air through one nostril than the other. Not only that, but it seems our nostrils switch over dominant roles every two hours. Now, that's all very interesting, but so what? How does it affect the way we smell or eat food? Quite a lot, it seems. The left-hand side of the brain deals with speech and the right-hand with emotions. And the nostrils direct air straight to the brain. So if your left nostril is in its dominant cycle, you may find it easier to describe what you're eating at the time, while if the right is dominant you may get a heightened sense of smell from the food. The other week I pointed out that we all taste things slightly differently. Well, it seems that we smell them differently, too, depending on what part of the breathing cycle we happen to be in. We don't seem to think as much as we might about smell or how we react to odour molecules, but smell is one of the motors of our whole taste apparatus. We physically have to sniff, but no two people sniff the same. In fact, some people have more developed senses of smell than others - for instance, the main character in Patrick S\u00fcskind's novel Perfume, who basically lived life through his nose. \u00b7 Heston Blumenthal is chef/proprietor of the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
