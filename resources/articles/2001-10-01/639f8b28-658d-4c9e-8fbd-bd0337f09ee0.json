But Liffe is unlikely to be rushed into a response as it awaits possible offers from other suitors. Although an early bid from the LSE would give the exchange \"first mover\" advantage, expectations are centred on whether its offer would be in cash or a mixture of cash and shares. Some observers argue that an all-cash offer would be more likely to appeal to the two US funds, Blackstone Group and Battery Ventures, which hold just under 30% of Liffe shares and have options to take the stake close to 40%. Although the LSE has less cash on its balance sheet than rival exchanges such as Euronext or Deutsche B\u00f6rse, City sources believe it would have little trouble funding an all-cash offer if required. Yesterday neither Liffe nor the LSE would be drawn on the speculation that the offer is likely to be in the \u00a313 to \u00a314 a share range. Last Thursday, ahead of the Liffe announcement that it had received a number of possible bid approaches and the LSE's confirmation that it was interested in making an offer, shares in the derivatives exchange were changing hands at \u00a38.60. Yesterday, with the City scenting an auction, they were quoted at \u00a312.50-\u00a312.75. Although the LSE is the only declared runner, there is continuing speculation that one of the Chicago derivatives exchanges or Nasdaq in New York might be interested in Liffe. Euronext, the alliance of the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges, is said to be interested, while Frankfurt's Deutsche B\u00f6rse is likely to be following developments. The LSE's ambitions have been attacked as little more than \"bulking up\", but its strategy is winning support. Magnus Costello of Merrill Lynch said LSE revenues were dependent on equity market volumes and the acquisition of Liffe would provide a more diverse revenue stream."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
