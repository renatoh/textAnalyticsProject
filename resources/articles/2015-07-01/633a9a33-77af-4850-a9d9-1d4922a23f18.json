United are aware of Bayern\u2019s resistance though they have not given up hope of prising him away for a fee in the region of \u20ac80m (\u00a355.7m). M\u00fcller is flattered by Louis van Gaal\u2019s interest but the World Cup winner knows Bayern\u2019s position. While it is understood no bid has been made for the 25-year-old the proposed salary for M\u00fcller would be \u20ac20m a year (\u00a313.7m). This is around \u00a3265,000 a week, around double what he earns at the German champions from the five-year contract signed last summer. As a forward who can play across the front line M\u00fcller would fit into Van Gaal\u2019s proposed 4-3-3 formation for next season. Although M\u00fcller is one of Bayern\u2019s elite players and a favourite of the fans Pep Guardiola is less sure of his worth. The relationship between the two men is uneven. Recently, there was a training ground dispute and last season Guardiola dropped M\u00fcller, which resulted in the coach being whistled by Bayern supporters. This has caused the shift in M\u00fcller\u2019s view of a transfer to United from 12 months ago when he was not interested. Last week United bought Bastian Schweinsteiger from Bayern, one of the club\u2019s leading players. This means it would be difficult for Bayern to allow the sale of another. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the chief executive, promised supporters the 30-year-old midfielder would be the only Bayern player sold to United in this transfer window. United have bought four players since the season ended. Memphis Depay cost up to \u00a325m, Morgan Schneiderlin \u00a327m, Matteo Darmian \u00a312.7m and Schweinsteiger around \u00a315m for a total spend of \u00a379.7m. Speaking towards the end of last week Rummenigge recognised the spending power of United and the rest of the Premier League and voiced concern that German clubs\u2019 finest players could be stripped from them. \u201cThe Bundesliga has to finally act,\u201d he told Bild. \u201cThe English are overtaking us left, right and centre. When taking into account transfer market activity, in marketing terms, in TV money \u2013 anywhere, really. The Bundesliga has to be careful not to fall further behind, I think. Anyone who follows the transfer market at the moment, within which English clubs work, knows their clubs are being fully upgraded. The Bundesliga has to be careful that we\u2019re not emptied out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
