The world-record \u00a392.5m signing struggled in the opening phase of the season but he was a pivotal part of a display in a game United were unfortunate not to win. Pogba was involved in Juan Mata\u2019s fine 68th-minute opener and, despite the disappointment of Olivier Giroud\u2019s headed equaliser 60 seconds from the close of normal time, the manager is encouraged by the midfielder. Of the Frenchman, who operated in a box-to-box role, Mourinho said: \u201cHe is adapting much better in relationships, to the intensity of the competition, and he is much more confident. Obviously he plays with some guidelines over his position but at the same time with some freedom to occupy some attacking areas where he feels and thinks he can be important. He is comfortable on the pitch. That is the best way of saying it.\u201d Mourinho lined up Michael Carrick and Ander Herrera alongside Pogba in a formation that had Marcus Rashford as the striker, with Mata and Anthony Martial on the right and left. Antonio Valencia, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Matteo Darmian were the defence in what was United\u2019s most complete display under Mourinho. \u201cMidfield is playing very well,\u201d the manager said. \u201cPogba, Carrick, Herrera, they are playing very well. The defenders \u2013 the way Jones and Marcos performed was so solid and confident. We defended high and we were compact when we had to be. It is a very good performance. I go home with the feeling that I lost against Arsenal in the Premier League.\u201d This last comment was a quip about how the 53-year-old has never lost a competitive match against the Gunners. The draw leaves United sixth in the table, six points behind Arsenal, and Mourinho is encouraged regarding his side\u2019s prospects. He said: \u201cWe had one transfer window and four months of work \u2013 we have lots of young players and older players. We need to do a lot of work. But if you see Burnley, Stoke, Arsenal [all draws], if you have six more points which we totally deserved, where would we be?\u201d On Sunday West Ham United visit for United\u2019s 13th league outing. \u201cAt least I want someone to come here and play better than us and beat us,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cThen you can go home and say these guys were better than us. After the Arsenal match I go home and my feeling is that I have lost.\u201d Wayne Rooney was a 63rd-minute replacement after starting the previous 3-1 win at Swansea City. Mourinho said the decision to drop his captain was because he lacked the pace required to exploit Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side. \u201cI thought we were going to have the ball. Arsenal are a team who let the opponents play. I thought we would have space and the ball would arrive quite easily to the attacking players. I believed ones like Mata, Martial and Rashford were faster than Wayne, better attacking opponents one to one in the last line. I thought it was the best option.\u201d Carrick has started the past two league victories after being ignored by Mourinho. The manager is now enthused enough to want him to extend his contract beyond next summer for another year. \u201cMichael is 35 years old. With such an intense game he was having some cramps in the last period, which is normal,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIt is very sad to know that time flies for every one of us. He is such a fantastic player and it is a pity. I always loved him but instead of being his manager when he was 24 I am his manager when he is 35. We have a good understanding. We know when he can play. We know when he is ready and when he needs a rest. I am still having Michael Carrick and probably for one more season.\u201d Jones, 24, was making only a second appearance since 2 January because of a nightmarish spell out injured. \u201cIt is awful but as a footballer you can\u2019t feel sorry for yourself, go into a hole and never come out of your home,\u201d the defender said. \u201cYou have to go about your day as you would normally, work hard in training and I have worked to get back to where I am now. \u201cI want to stay here and I want to play more games. I have worked hard on my fitness. It has been tough mentally for me and it has been so frustrating. I can\u2019t put into words how frustrating it has been but that is behind me and I want to move forward to play as many games as I can.\u201d Jones agrees with Mourinho that United were unlucky. \u201cIt is crazy. If we had won today, then we would have been three points behind Arsenal,\u201d he said. \u201cArsenal have had a world-class season and we are supposed to have had an average season. That is just the way the Premier League works. But we are pleased with the performance. I thought we created chances and probably should have scored more.\u201d Wenger said: \u201cWhen you are 1-0 down and you come back to 1-1 with a minute to go, it feels more than a draw, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
