There are about 70m of the furry critters - or about 18 times as many possums as there are people. And they munch through a lot of vegetation. \"The possum has no predators,\" says the fur emporium nzpossumproducts.co.nz. \"They are a serious threat and many native trees, plants and birdlife, including the kiwi, are under threat from extinction because their habitat is being destroyed.\" You can buy possum-skin bikinis, coats, gloves (which, apparently, Tiger Woods wears on the golf course), hats and even bedspreads. \"We support killing possums,\" says Eric Pyle, conservation director of the World Wide Fund for Nature New Zealand. \"From a conservation perspective, they are seen as New Zealand's number-one pest problem.\" The protest group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, however, is against the killing of any animals for fur. So if you wear possum, you'll have to duck if one of its activists runs at you with a bucket of paint. Dance-powered lights Are you sick of wasting the power you put into doing the \"running man\" on the dance floor? Well, fear no more. Assuming you're in Rotterdam, you can convert all that energy into lighting the very dance floor you grace. You just dance on a pressure pad while the floor underneath illuminates in varying colours - not just green - powered by your movements. The Sustainable Dance Project was started last year, and the people behind it call for \"no more counter-culturists and moralising attitudes\". The organisers set up whole clubs inside existing ones for special events. Facilities include rainwater toilets, walls that change colour according to the heat in the room and \"biological beer\". In fact, the project's leader, Michet Smit, wants to convert all clubs into sustainable ones. So look down next time you're shaking it like you mean it - you could be saving the planet at the same time. Greener cars New eco-cars range from the slightly dubious hybrids that mix a V6 engine with an electric motor, to all-electric racing cars that can beat Ferraris. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger has had his Hummers converted to hydrogen (although there's no word on him giving up pumping cigar smoke into the atmosphere). Google moguls Sergey Brin and Larry Page are backing the Tesla, an environmentally friendly sports car that goes from 0-60 in four seconds and gets up to 135mph. It is all-electric, hence the odd spectacle of a car that looks like a Lotus zooming around almost silently. \"You don't have to compromise,\" says Martin Eberhard, co-founder of the car company. \"It's got airbags, air-conditioning, satellite navigation systems, satellite radio and heated seats.\" As if to give it the final seal of approval, Arnie has also been pictured in one. Solar-powered vibrators There are, sadly, no statistics on exactly how much environmental damage is caused by vibrators powered by conventional means. But, just in case it's unexpectedly second only to long-haul flights for carbon emissions, a company called California Exotic has created a solar-powered vibrator called Solar Sensations. A full charge (sunlight is the quickest way to replenish the battery, but artificial light will do) will last two-and-a-half hours. It's disguised as a mobile phone, in case you're scared that leaving your sex toys on the windowsill will cause a stir among the neighbours. You too can \"enjoy the benefits of clean, environmentally friendly pleasure,\" according to the company's website. I suppose it's one less reason to feel guilty. Green cleaners No, it's not a service that offers inexperienced cleaners. Around America, various environmentally friendly maid services have sprung up offering a departure from chemical-heavy commercial cleaning products. Msgreenclean.com, a website that offers the service in New York, is fighting back against the toxins in the sprays, gels, unguents and liquids that we use around the house. \"I use cleansers I mix myself using recipes containing vinegar, borax, baking soda, essential oils and other natural and aromatic ingredients that won't harm the environment, or your family's health,\" says Ms Green Clean herself, Cori Morenberg. She hopes, thus, to stop the environmental damage that occurs when we wash chemicals down the drain, and into rivers and the sea. And, as if that wasn't enough, she also offers \"environmental consultations\" to make your house even greener. Limousines Until recently if you were an environmentally conscious film star, you faced a problem come awards season: pulling up to the Oscar red carpet could only really be done in a gas-guzzling limousine, destroying your eco-credentials for all the world to see. But this year, companies such as Eco Limo have been dropping stars off in anything ranging from a blacked-out Prius to a compressed natural gas-powered Chevy Suburban (an off-roader about the size of Wales). \"Other limousine drivers laughed at me when I first showed up at events,\" says Eco-Limo founder Y Fray. \"They aren't laughing any more.\" Not with a client list that apparently includes everyone from Leonardo DiCaprio to Steven Spielberg and Charlize Theron, anyway. Shopping bags If you couldn't get hold of an Anya Hindmarch \"I'm not a plastic bag\" bag, but still want to impress people at the checkout, the highest of high-end designers are now also doing reusable shopping bags. For around \u00a3250, Stella McCartney's organic canvas bag will tell people that, though you're concerned for the environment, you've still got style (and too much money). And, in case fellow shoppers aren't au fait enough with Stella's designs to be able to tell where you got it, it also has her name across the front. If one bag isn't enough, and it's simply too boring to buy two McCartney bags, Herm\u00e8s has a silk foldaway bag, complete with carrying pouch for around \u00a3500. Just don't break any eggs on the way home. MP3 player Trevor Baylis, the inventor of the wind-up radio, has applied his crank-mechanism to a potential iPod-beater. \"The eco-technology is as relevant and cutting edge today as it was 16 years ago,\" he says. His Eco-Media player plays mp3s and videos, has a radio, stores files, is a sound recorder and can even be used to charge your mobile phone. Ecologically sound music fans will have to limit themselves to two gigabytes of songs, although they can add more if they buy a memory card. The device has a 1.8in colour screen, and while it's not as sexy as anything Apple turns out, it has also got a torch built in. Which means that, in the event of a nuclear holocaust, or a random car breakdown, it's the music player you'd want by your side. And if you do ever get tired of cranking, it even charges via your USB port."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
