The 36-year-old has agreed to stay at Filbert Street until the end of the season but as a player rather than a coach or a scout for England's coach Sven-Goran Eriksson. Mancini, capped 36 times by Italy in a career spent mainly with Sampdoria, was an assistant coach to Eriksson at Lazio until the Swede resigned last week. Dino Zoff, Eriksson's successor at the Rome club, asked Mancini to stay but he resigned and Taylor was able to pursue an interest he first expressed a couple of months ago. \"The seeds of the idea were sown when, as England's caretaker manager, I first went to Rome to talk to Mr Eriksson about the national team,\" Taylor explained. \"I told him about the situation at Leicester and how we needed an experienced striker to help our inexperienced ones. That's when Robbie's name was mentioned. Obviously he was tied up then but the changes at Lazio have let me pursue it. \"Now I'm delighted to have him here but the one thing I'm anxious to clear up for both his and Leicester's sake is that he is nothing to do with the Football Association. Neither is he here to coach. My plan is for Robbie to help our young strikers such as Ade Akinbiyi and Trevor Benjamin. \"They were bought to play alongside Stan Collymore but that plan did not materialise. We've missed a player like Stan who is capable of playing as a link-up striker - the role Robbie will fill.\" Taylor had tried to recruit Mark Hughes but lost out to Blackburn Rovers. The arrival of such a big name as Mancini has rapidly erased that disappointment, especially among the players. \"He's certainly freshened us up in the two days he's trained with us so far,\" Taylor added. \"The players have been doing ball skills with an all-time great in Robbie Mancini and they're enjoying every moment of it. It's well worth it for us.\" It will be even more worth it if Mancini, who reportedly agreed a \u00a325,000-a-week contract which will earn him \u00a3500,000 in his short stay, proves to be the catalyst that revives Leicester's season and helps them qualify for Europe. And, Taylor points out, England could also benefit. \"With Mr Eriksson over here full time now, I'm sure they will meet up. That's only to be expected. It's also to be expected Robbie will be asked how, for example, he played against Arsenal and how Tony Adams played. That's fine; I'm not worried about that.\" Mancini may be able to answer that question tomorrow evening, after Leicester have played the Gunners, and that despite not having played competitively since May. \"Obviously his legs are not as quick as they were but his brain has become quicker,\" Taylor added. I've seen [it] from the two days he spent with us and know how fit he is.\" For his part Mancini, speaking through an interpreter, said: \"I haven't been playing because I've been involved in the course I need to become a coach. But I have had offers from Italian clubs to keep playing and I have continued to train. I guess I need three or four games to get back to full fitness.\" Mancini understands that will be necessary after talking to his former Sampdoria team-mates Gianluca Vialli and David Platt. \"They've both told me the team-spirit is excellent and they do a lot of running,\" he said. Mancini may soon be joined by Derby County's Dean Sturridge. The 27-year-old striker, out of contract in the summer, was due to open talks last night and would cost \u00a3300,000 - almost \u00a34m less than a Middlesbrough offer which Derby rejected only three years ago. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
