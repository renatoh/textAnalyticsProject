The Prison Service pledged to oust any employee on the list and far-right supporters spoke of fear for their livelihoods as the BNP was plunged into crisis. Party officials complained that hundreds of members had received threatening or abusive telephone calls within hours of the list being posted on the internet, and feared that the episode could lead to a damaging slump in support and membership. Merseyside police, who discovered the name of one of its constables on the list, identified him and said that he had served briefly as the chief constable's driver. A spokesman said: \"We are very clear: membership of the British National party is totally incompatible with the duties and values of the police service and Merseyside police. We will not accept a police officer or police staff being a member of BNP. As a matter of urgency, we have immediately started an investigation into all aspects of this case.\" Scotland Yard, Surrey and West Yorkshire police also confirmed that they were studying the list, and the Association of Chief Police Officers said it expected every other force to follow suit. A detective inspector serving in the professional standards department of a Midlands force, who was checking the list against his force personnel records, said: \"Even people on the list who are lapsed members of the BNP, or who have just approached the party expressing an interest in joining, will be of interest to us.\" Any officer found to be a member of the party will face disciplinary action and is likely to be dismissed. The Prison Service is also investigating whether any of its officers are on the list. The secret membership lists the occupations of some members, and one individual, living near York, is identified as a serving police officer. Rod Lucas, a presenter with TalkSport radio station, was also identified as a member, but said he joined the BNP at the same time that he joined around 20 other organisations, during a research project. \"I find the BNP distasteful, I wouldn't vote for them. Sometimes you have to get your hands dirty,\" he said. Around 13,000 names and addresses appear on the list. It is thought to include a number of lapsed members and possibly the names of individuals who contacted the party and expressed interest in joining but did not do so. However, the BNP has confirmed that it is essentially a genuine membership list. It includes the names of a number of clergymen, an actor, two solicitors, at least one doctor and a number of primary and secondary school teachers. A handful of those contacted by the Guardian said their names appeared by mistake, claiming to have no interest in the BNP. \"We're absolutely horrified by this,\" said a retired teacher from West Yorkshire, who has appeared on the list with her husband. \"We're absolutely devastated and wondering if we offended someone and they applied to the BNP with our names as a joke. We're contacting lawyers but what can we do?\" Many were open about their membership, however, declaring they had nothing to be ashamed of. \"There's nothing wrong about being a member of the BNP,\" said John Page, 66, recently retired from teaching foreign students at Barnfield College in Luton. \"Some people at work \u2014 colleagues and students \u2014 knew about my membership. I've never had any problems with it.\" Ida Jordan, 80, from Preston, said she had received threats. \"It was an educated male voice. He said: 'Take care now. You are a racist.' My opinion is that we should look after our own country, our own people, but I don't have any animosity toward people of a different colour or religion.\" Jan Gibson, a pensioner from Quorn in Leicestershire, said she and her husband had been members for four years. \"I have nothing against coloured people at all. They can't help their colour. I can't help being white,\" she said. \"Our friends know we are in the British National party. They actually agree with us. They have not got the courage to do what we do. A lot of people think as we do.\" The release of the list offers a new insight into areas of the country that appear to have the highest numbers of supporters for the BNP. A total of 192,746 voters cast their ballot for the party in the 2005 general election, just 0.7% of the total vote, restricted to the limited numbers of constituencies where the party put up candidates. Previous analysis of the BNP's support base relied on its recent successes in local elections. The party has its largest numbers of councillors - 12 - in Barking and Dagenham, with strong representations in councils in Stoke-on-Trent and Epping Forest in Essex. Although the police and the Prison Service are thought to be the only public bodies that prohibit membership of the BNP, many other individuals could face disciplinary action once their membership is known. Nick Griffin, leader of the BNP, said he had little doubt that the leak was \"a disgraceful act of treachery\" by disgruntled former BNP officials."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
