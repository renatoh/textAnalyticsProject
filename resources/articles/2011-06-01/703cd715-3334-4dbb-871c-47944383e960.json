If a 22-year-old Northern Irishman, after all, could waltz to the US Open title in record-breaking fashion, couldn't a 24-year-old Scot, champion at Queen's Club a week ago, finally claim Wimbledon? Wasn't there reason, more broadly, to have hopes for the women's squad, considered by some to be the strongest Britain has fielded in years? The All England Championships might be celebrating 125 years without much of a tweak, but was it really so foolish to hope, at long last, for a different ending to the old, old story of British tennis? By the close of play, normal service, in more ways than one, had been resumed. The skies, dark and ominous all day, finally opened at 5pm, ending all play but that under the Centre Court roof, where Andy Murray would start his campaign. Those who dare to dream of a British win \u2013 and for the foreseeable future, that means Murray if anyone \u2013 were brought back to earth with a bump when the Scot wobbled, losing his first set 4-6 to the little-fancied Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver. Though his recovery \u2013 or his opponent's collapse \u2013 was emphatic, with the match finally closing 4-6, 6-3, 6-0, 6-0 and BBC commentators John McEnroe and John Lloyd declaring it \"the perfect opening round\", he had given fans enough of a scare to remind anyone who needed it that heartbreak is only a dropped service game or two away. In truth it had taken no more than 17 minutes of play for the fragile expectancy of a nation to take its first clanging dent. That is how long 25-year-old Katie O'Brien, British number 4, had been on her feet in the first match of the day before she found herself sitting down again, having lost the first set 6-0. That her opponent, Japan's Kimiko Date-Krumm, will be 41 in three months, only reinforced the sense of youthful hopes being crushed by well-worn experience. In the unreserved seats, one or two small union flags flapped gamely, but she lost in straight sets. Wimbledon habitu\u00e9s have long since learned to manage expectations. Judith Macpherson, an attendee of many years, wearing the discreet blue tag of the All England Club debenture holder, the championships were \"something for the country to be proud of. It's beautifully organised, everyone seems to be happy, there's no fighting or cheating, anything like that. Obviously one would love a British winner, one always hopes. But it would be only an extra enjoyment, not why we love Wimbledon.\" For those not in possession of a debenture's Centre Court seat, that love was soon to be tested. Daniel Cox, the British number 3, appeared to be following O'Brien to defeat having dropped his first set 6-2, when the skies over SW19 finally opened. Covers were dragged across courts, umbrellas and hooded capes unfurled, and Britain reminded itself that there is remains one sport \u2013 uncomplaining stoicism \u2013 at which it is the undisputed world champion. \"Of course we're not leaving!\" declared Sally Geer from Winchester, huddled under an umbrella with her friend Liz Waites, in front of the big screen showing footage from Centre Court. Geer was sitting in a large puddle of water and their box of cakes was soggy and splashing, but the pair insisted their spirits remained high. \"Our friends have just wimped out and left, but I'm sure it's brightening up. Andy Murray will come on, the rain will go, and people will start coming back.\" Waites, a \"manic\" tennis fan, said she had high hopes for Murray this year but confessed she really loved Rafael Nadal. \"Any time he plays Murray, I really am torn.\" Nadal, the defending champion also stuttered briefly in his opening set, dropping to 2-4 against American Michael Russell, but in the end took the match comfortably in three sets. Venus Williams also cruised to victory over Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan, though Jelena Dokic, a former Wimbledon semi-finalist was defeated by 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone. As that match drew to a close, the crowds squeezing under umbrellas in front of the big screen on Court One gave a small cheer in anticipation of Murray's, the event for which many had been waiting all day. It was not to be. \"Due to the prevailing weather conditions and on the grounds of health and safety, there will be no further tennis shown on this screen,\" read a notice \u2013 the first time \"Henman Hill\" had been closed in the tournament's history. \"'We just can't have people slipping and sliding and falling off the thing and breaking their ankles,\" said spokesman Johnny Perkins. \"It's regrettable but wise in view of the circumstances.\" Clasping their macs to their ears and muttering about fairness, several hundred dripping fans began to peel away, while under the Centre Court roof, the luckier 14,979, perfectly dry, welcomed the Scot onto court to launch this year's bid for glory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
