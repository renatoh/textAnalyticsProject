The period drama remake was one of the most talked-about programmes of 2015 in which the topic of topless scything became an unlikely national obsession. Its 10-part second series, adapted by Debbie Horsfield from the novels by Winston Graham, will air on BBC1 later this year. The third series commission, announced on Wednesday, means its new incarnation will come close to matching the number of episodes of the 29-strong original run in 1975. Executive producer Elizabeth Kilgarriff said: \u201cSeries two promises to take the audience on another fantastic rollercoaster ride and we\u2019re thrilled to know that the story won\u2019t end there. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to Debbie\u2019s brilliant storytelling and the passion of the Mammoth team that Poldark will be returning for a third series with yet more twists and turns for these much loved characters.\u201d Turner stars as Ross Poldark alongside Eleanor Tomlinson as his wife Demelza in the drama which peaked with more than 9 million viewers in BBC1\u2019s Sunday night drama slot last year. Damien Timmer, managing director of its producer, Mammoth Screen, said: \u201cPoldark is a passion project for all of us, and it\u2019s with real excitement that we prepare for both the launch of series two and our return to Cornwall to shoot series three. \u201cWinston Graham and Debbie Horsfield\u2019s extraordinary flair for storytelling means the saga of Ross, his friends and enemies will go to even more thrilling places.\u201d New additions to the cast for the second series include former Midsomer Murders star John Nettles, who will play one of the county\u2019s wealthiest landowners, as well as Gabriella Wilde (Endless Love) and W1A\u2019s Hugh Skinner. However, fans hoping for more scenes of Turner scything away with his top off are likely to be in for a disappointment after programme makers said the eponymous hero would keep his shirt on in the next series."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
