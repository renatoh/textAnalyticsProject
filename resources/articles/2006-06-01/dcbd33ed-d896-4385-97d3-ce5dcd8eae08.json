The old division of labour under which the Europeans negotiated with Tehran while Washington held its nose and looked the other way is no longer tenable. With all due respect to the EU's ambition to play a bigger global role, the relationship that really matters is the one between the world's only superpower and the country it has struggled to deal with since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Europe, represented by Britain, France and Germany, cannot deliver what is needed to resolve this potentially grave crisis. Far bigger carrots, and perhaps sticks, are required. Excitement at Wednesday's announcement of this significant policy shift by Condoleezza Rice gave way to a more sober mood when Iran insisted it would not halt uranium enrichment. It is entitled to do this for the declared purpose of generating energy, but as the US, Europeans, Arabs and Israelis all warn (pointing to 18 years of concealment) it can also be used for weapons production. Complicating matters, there are sharply differing assessments about when Iran might acquire a military nuclear capability. But it would be wrong to read too much into what sounds like a ritual re-assertion of a core position. There have been enough nuanced signals from Iranian officials to suggest that there is indeed something to talk about. Iran's UN ambassador, for example, said only last week that enrichment could be capped at a level below what is required to produce a weapon. And Iran did suspend its enrichment during earlier talks with the EU. Still, pragmatic and moderate messages have often been contradicted by the fundamentalist president, Mohammed Ahmadinejad. Western attempts to encourage his rivals have not been successful. Mr Ahmadinejad and his colleagues should think carefully about what they want to happen. The reason Mr Bush took the domestically risky step (ignoring Dick Cheney and neocon hawks) of engaging conditionally with Tehran was that he could not count on the support of Russia and China for punitive action against a non-compliant Iran. At the UN, the US has quietly agreed to assurances that sanctions would not be adopted without a vote by the security council (a lesson learned the hard way over Iraq), and accepted that threatening force is not part of this process. So talk of air strikes and regime change has given way, for now at least, to real multilateral diplomacy. With the US shifting dramatically to engagement - even if presented as \"tactical shift\" rather than the much discussed \"grand bargain\" that will be necessary - Iranian intransigence could meet a more united response in the council. Tehran, bolstered by booming oil prices and America's problems in Iraq, may gamble that it will not. The importance of this move goes far beyond the nuclear dossier. The US was the shah's main supporter until he fell 27 years ago. The 444-day hostage crisis is part of a bitter legacy of mutual demonisation that includes the Iran-Contra affair, US backing for Israel, Mr Bush's \"axis of evil\" rhetoric and Iranian support for groups such as Lebanon's Hizbullah and Hamas in Palestine. Mr Ahmadinejad's recent anti-Israel rhetoric is a serious aggravating factor. The incentives being presented by the EU troika, with US backing, are likely to be an upgraded version of what they first put forward last summer. The imperative in any trade-off must be Iranian agreement to allow intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency - the very best defence against dodgy intelligence assessments of Iranian capabilities. For Tehran, the big prize in the package would be formal security guarantees, fully endorsed by Washington, that would recognise its legitimate concerns about a volatile region. Jaw-jaw has to be better than a slide to war-war. It is up to both sides to find enough common ground to start talking - and keep doing so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
