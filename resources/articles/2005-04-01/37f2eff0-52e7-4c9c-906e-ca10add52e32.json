Yet the decisions taken in your younger years may have a direct bearing on your wellbeing later on. In your 60s or 70s you could look back and realise that but for one or a series of youthful financial decisions, you could be more comfortable. So what are the common youthful errors that could leave you struggling through old age? We ask two experts: 'Young people today want everything yesterday' Keith Tondeur, director of money education charity Credit Action Tondeur believes the biggest problem is debt, with dependency on loans beginning at university. 'Because of student loans, young people today think that to get on in life you have to borrow,' he says. 'This is very damaging in the long term. You could continue building up debt for years. Then you will struggle when you want to settle down and buy your first home because you could be barred from credit.' Tondeur believes young people's spending habits are influenced by peer pressure. 'You have to buy the right clothing label or DVD, never mind the cost. Young people today want everything yesterday. At school they have never been taught how to budget and differentiate between a want and a need. If they need more money they get a consolidated loan.' Tondeur worries that young people don't understand the dangers of credit cards. 'Some think that the higher APR on their credit cards the better! They would rather curl up and die than bother working out percentages. 'They don't realise that 40 per cent of the credit card companies' profits come from late payments. There's a whole range of things out there to catch them out. 'Thirty years ago, to borrow money you had to go to the bank manager, who looked after you. Now a bank will try and sell you a range of products and services. 'An early pension is key' Ian Runcie, financial adviser Runcie feels the greatest error is failing to start a pension scheme soon enough, and then not contributing enough to it. 'The advice today is that people should start a scheme between the ages of 23 and 25. If they want to retire at 55, they can have, say, 30 years of comfortable retirement. Every year worked needs to fund one year in retirement. Our parents' generation worked for 40 years to fund 15 years of retirement. The ratios have changed, so people have to start as early as possible.' Runcie believes that women especially should make early and large contributions. 'If they are going to have a career break, they must save hard before it happens. Put in more than you perceive you need to.' Mortgages are also problematic, says Runcie. 'Many are taking out interest-only mortgages. They have no plan about how to pay the capital back. If you don't start repaying by your 40s or 50s, it is a potential timebomb.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
