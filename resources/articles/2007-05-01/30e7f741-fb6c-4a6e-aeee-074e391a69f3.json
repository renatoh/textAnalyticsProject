For all the copycat accusations levelled at the Birmingham four-piece since their widescreen post-punk first met with success in 2005, songs such as 'Munich' and 'Blood' packed an anthemic punch few of their more angular peers could match. And as for the comparisons with NYC peers Interpol, Editors substituted the balls-out swagger of that outfit's crunching guitar sound with a grandstanding post-rock sensitivity all of their own. Besides, when was the last time a member of Interpol had a number two record while going out with Radio One's Edith Bowman? Unfortunately it's not enough simply to swaddle yourself in layers of Edge-like reverb and declare yourself an epic. You've got to bring the tunes to back it up, and parts of An End Has a Start are all sound and fury, signifying nothing. On the other hand, when the band do snap suddenly into focus, you really sit up and take notice - 'The Racing Rats' is a rattling, full-tilt delight, the Bunnymen-esque 'Escape the Nest' sounds choppy and propulsive, and the spare piano chords and skittering drums of 'When Anger Shows' make it the alt-rock cousin of Baby D's 'Let Me Be Your Fantasy'. Epiphany by its very nature is a fleeting beast; by trying to force the moment too often Editors neglect the simple details that make your hairs really stand on end. But, for now at least, their tendency towards overwrought ambition fails to dim the slew of stellar moments that make An End ... a worthy successor to their star-making debut.
