What's that? Is it someone throwing down a bag of spanners from a great height? No, it's bigger than that. Could it be all the cymbal players from all the world's philharmonic orchestras, joining together in a frenzied orgy of cymbal bashing? Ohhh nonononononono. No, in fact it is the sound of name-dropper Terry Henry needlessly pointing out that he's got loads of celebrity friends. And he did it again last night when he celebrated a goal by revealing to the world that he's best mates with that Scottish lass from out of Texas. \"It was a special message for a friend and she will know who she is,\" Terry mumbled humbly. Arsenal Wenger wasn't quite so coy when he discovered that Terry could be put under FA arrest for wearing the vest (as it contravenes Fifa directives on what underwear the players are allowed to sport). \"Everything is forbidden,\" he said. It's true: they can't wear boxer shorts now; it has to be Fifa-regulation sports briefs. \"To show emotion is forbidden,\" Wenger went on. \"You have to create rules but for me spontaneous celebration is part of the game and I wouldn't want that to be cut out.\" So spontaneous, in fact, was the gesture that Terry went to the trouble of spontaneously getting one of Arsene's special Nike vests, taking it to a printers before the game on a whim, and thinking up a witty message off the top of his head without a moment's thought. There was clearly an air of spontaneity around Highbury last night, because Kelvin Koogan suffered a similar attack of on-the-spot emotion when talking about the linesman who got Ali Benarbia sent off. \"He was so biased it was frightening,\" Koog ranted. \"I don't think the linesman knew there was another team playing out there. I'll give him zero on his report as that's what I think he deserved. I was so annoyed. I understand why Benarbia showed dissent.\" But happily it's all worked out for the best, because judging from the noises coming out of the FA, it looks like they're both going to escape Adam Crozier's cane. It's certainly hooray for Henry anyway, who will only receive a written warning. \"We will be writing to Henry to remind him of the regulation,\" said FA spokesman Adrian Bevington, whose hairy breasts we presume are kept nice and toasty by a slogan-free slip. So next time round, Terry will now have to find some other way of publicly thanking the Queen for lending him her Clio. 2008 STATE Svennis is on the run. On Monday he gave Ferg the slip. Yesterday he side-stepped Wilko. Today he has probably sold Adam Crozier a beautiful dummy, but we can't be sure, which is a shame because we were enjoying his bodyswerving escapades. We could make something up, but we won't. Instead we will bring you a cautionary little tale from the depths of the Irish psyche, to be sure, top o' the morning, begorrah, I'm a leprechaun. And we promise not to pander to cheap stereotype while we're at it. Our story begins in Ireland-Scotland, a charming Celtic ghetto off the north-west coast of Merseyside. I-S are preparing a joint bid to host Euro 2008, but with less than six years to go they are starting to run into a few problems (to be sure). The Scottish half of I-S are doing just fine: they will be putting forward six stadiums for the bid, and you know they're taking things seriously because they're calling them stadia. It's when you chat to the Irish (begorrah) that things start to go a little haywire. If you believe everything written in 'What Celtic Tiger? A Guide to Modern Ireland' by Frank Carson and Jimmy Cricket, the Irish apparently spend a lot of time drinking Guinness, and have only been asked to provide two stadiums. Lansdowne Road is one of them, but that's as good as it gets (so it is). The first problem - cheers! - is that the biggest stadium in the country, Dublin's Croke Park in Dublin, is a no-no because it is only allowed to host Gaelic sports (which strikes the Fiver as petty and immature (to be sure)). The second problem - same again! - is that the Irish government has vetoed prime minister Bertie Ahern's plans to pay for a stadium on the outskirts of trendy stag-and-hen night venue Dublin. But I-S are not to be deterred - buy yourself one! - and Euro 2008 marketing director Simon Lyons insists that where public funding has failed, private funding will succeed. \"Depending on the size of the stadium,\" he observed reassuringly, \"this is eminently achievable. It is a big political shift but the will is there without a doubt. We are still full-steam ahead. At present, our construction of stadia is the most developed of all the bids.\" Barman! Another stereotype when you've got a minute! QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Although I won't be playing competitive football over the coming months I will continue to be a big part of the team\" - Pregnant Fulham Ladies captain Katie Chapman is gravid with wit. And since when have Fulham Ladies' games been competitive? IT'S A RICH LAD'S WORLD Last weekend, pocket Irishman Damien Duff slipped off to play for his country only to return to Blackburn all bust and jiggered. One false fire-alarm caused by smoke billowing out of Graeme Souness's ears later, and the FAI had promised to pay Rovers \u00a3100,000 in \"adequate compensation\" for the wee jinky lad's thigh injury. \"His club will be adequately compensated through our insurance,\" said an FAI spokesperson. Still, an excuse to have a rant and all that. \"There should be compensation with the wages players are on these days,\" steamed Souness, surely only addling his syntax because he was concentrating so much on delivering the following analogy. \"It's like having a factory and buying an expensive machine. Then someone comes along and says, 'I'm taking it away and the chances are it will return broken. It's your problem not mine'. What other business works like that?\" Sadly for Graeme, finger-on-the-pulse agent Hayden Evans, whose clients include current internationals such as David Batty and, er, was on hand to see the Blackburn boss's analogy and raise him an extended metaphor. \"Graeme has a valid point, but he also has to be aware that in no other industry could you loan out a piece of equipment and have it returned worth \u00a35m more than when it was taken,\" he trumped smugly. However, Evans then totally spoilt the effect of his smart wordplay. \"In the end, with very few exceptions, players want to represent their countries and, if pushed, the vast majority would do so for nothing.\" Does he mean that, if push came to shove between clubs and national associations, players would forgo a week's wages to play international soccer for nowt? Right you are, aye. We wouldn't be surprised if lightbulbs aren't lighting above the heads of club managers all across the land as we speak. Metaphorical ones, obviously. THE RUMOUR MILL According to footballtransfers.info, Dennis Wise has retired. But get that champagne back on ice: 'tis merely unconfirmed. The 37-year-old defender Steve Walsh may soon be enjoying the bright lights of Tamworth after being released by Coventry. Manchester City are rather keen on Barnet's slip of a lad, Ismail Yakubu, who is 17 years old and likes to play in defence. NEWS IN BRIEF The FA have launched an investigation into the violence which marred Luton's Worthington Cup win over Watford at Vicarage Road last night. Two arrests were made and one man was rushed to hospital after running battles were fought between rival hooligans on the pitch. The two sides had not met for four years. Duncan Ferguson will attempt to resurrect his injury-ravaged career in Solihull next week in a reserve game against Birmingham City. Ferguson, 30, has been troubled by a long-term back injury. World Cup referee Byron Moreno, who angered the whole of Italy with his display in the Azzurri's defeat at the hands of South Korea, has been suspended for 20 matches and placed under investigation by the Ecuadorian FA for his handling of a match last Sunday. Moreno, who is standing for election in October for a place on the Quito city council, allowed 13 minutes of extra time, during which Liga de Quito scored two late goals to overcome Barcelona of Guayaquil 4-3. He also sent off two players and awarded two dubious penalties. The knee injury to Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes may rule him out of action for the rest of the year, rather than the original estimate of three to six weeks.
