The designer\u2019s social media following \u2013 7.6 million for Off-White, 4.6 million for his personal account \u2013 was arguably a factor in him becoming the creative director of menswear for Louis Vuitton last year. But, for Off-White\u2019s spring/summer 2020 menswear show in Paris on Wednesday, Abloh\u2019s collection looked further back, to the graffiti scene in 1980s New York. He collaborated with Futura, a contemporary of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, on a series of spray-painted prints. If the reference was from the past, the show was designed for the photo opportunities necessary for now. The set featured a sea of white carnations planted in turf, with a Futura sculpture pride of place. Abloh is one of only a few designers of colour in fashion and his casting and front row were noticeably diverse. Celebrities including Lewis Hamilton watched a collection based on 1980s street culture, 1990s dorm rooms and plastic. The show\u2019s finales saw male and female models, including Gigi Hadid, walk through the field of flowers, the women in ball gowns decorated with Futura prints. It was a perfectly orchestrated moment designed for social media. As always with Abloh, there were also very wearable clothes. Off-White is a cult label on the streetwear scene \u2013 and the classics of the genre were here: bucket hats, gilets, denim jackets and bumbags. They will no doubt be snapped up by his devoted young fanbase. His quote mark branding \u2013 with items labelled \u201ccap\u201d, \u201cwallet\u201d, \u201cboots\u201d, etc \u2013 chimes with a generation who like to wear their meta culture on their sleeve. Backstage, after the show, Abloh said the theme was plastic but it was not really a crusade against single-use waste. Instead, it was \u201ca metaphor for how over a generation a term can transition to mean something else \u2013 from a utility to a polarising term\u201d. Some pieces used recycled plastic and the invite was made of the material. Abloh spoke about the influence of Futura on his own trajectory. \u201cHe\u2019s important to the foundation, to streetwear before it was known to a mass public,\u201d said the designer. Abloh is now providing that foundation for others. As the designer was talking, a model came up and hugged him. \u201cThank you for being the blueprint,\u201d he said to Abloh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
