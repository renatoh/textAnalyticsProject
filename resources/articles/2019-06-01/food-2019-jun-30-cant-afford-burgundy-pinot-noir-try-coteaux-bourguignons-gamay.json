Try these\u2026", "bodyText": "Coteaux Bourguignons, France 2018 (\u00a38.50, Marks &amp; Spencer) Is Beaujolais part of Burgundy? A lot of Burgundian winemakers don\u2019t like the idea that it might be. Their reasoning is pragmatic, but coloured with snobbery. Burgundy has a jealously guarded reputation for making some of the world\u2019s finest wines, while Beaujolais is still associated in many minds with the banana-and-bubblegum simplicity of its \u2018big in the 1980s\u2019 nouveau wines. Still, the two (one?) region\u2019s vignerons have been co-habiting in a single appellation since late 2011. The appellation stretches from the Auxerrois north of Chablis to Beaujolais in the south, although many of the examples I\u2019ve encountered in the UK tend to be Beaujolais in all but name, such as M&amp;S\u2019s free-flowing, blackberry-juicy version made from the region\u2019s trademark gamay grape. Louis Latour Les Pierres Dor\u00e9es, France 2017 (from \u00a317.89, The Drink Shop; Wine Direct) Not all the Beaujolais-alikes produced under the Coteaux Bourguignons label are pure gamays. A number, while certainly sharing the sappy, light succulence you\u2019d expect from a Beaujolais, mix it up with pinot noir \u2013 a blend that works well in the vibrant Loron &amp; Fils Duc de Belmont Coteaux Bourguignons Rouge 2017 (\u00a312.49, or \u00a310.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, Majestic) with its red and blackberry charm. The Coteaux Bourguignons name is also useful for those of us with the taste, but not the bank balance for Burgundy pinot noir. Certainly, the pinot noir vines planted by Burgundy producer Louis Latour in Beaujolais have yielded a red wine with the kind of prettiness and subtle herby-earthiness that would cost much more with a Burgundy village on the label. Domaine Grivot Coteaux Bourguignons, France 2016 (\u00a322.50, House of Townend; Laithwaite\u2019s) The Coteaux Bourguignons isn\u2019t all about red wine. Far from it. Winemakers can make effortlessly charming ros\u00e9 from gamay, such as the softly textured Louis Jadot Coteaux Bourguignons Ros\u00e9 2017 (from \u00a312.99, Penistone Wine). And the same firm, Louis Jadot, also has a good-value white, Louis Jadot Coteaux Bourguignons Blanc 2017 (\u00a312.04, as part of a case of six bottles, Fine Wine Services), which it makes from chardonnay blended with aligot\u00e9, for a wine that combines ripe apples and lemon. The best wine I\u2019ve tried from the appellation is, however, a red that embodies the best of both regions: made by one of Burgundy\u2019s greatest producers, Domaine Jean Grivot, from old gamay vines in Burgundy\u2019s C\u00f4te de Nuits, it\u2019s captivatingly pretty and pure and a fraction of the price of a Grivot pinot.
