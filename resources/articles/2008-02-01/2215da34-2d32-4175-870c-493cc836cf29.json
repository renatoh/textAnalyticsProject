Even with Andy Murray this would have been a mighty difficult task. Without him victory was beyond reasonable contemplation. Britain's acting No1, Alex Bogdanovic, is ranked No 188 in the world. Argentina has 19 players ranked higher. It was no contest. It was a grey, cloudy Wimbledon-like sort of morning, although with so many eucalypts surrounding the Parque Roca stadium, coupled with the humidity, it might just have been Sydney, where Britain last played in the world group five years ago against Australia. On that occasion the absence of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski doomed Britain to defeat with all the certainty that the lack of Murray did this time. Both Bogdanovic and Jamie Baker were duly beaten in straight sets. Britain has only one singles player of international quality and he chose to travel to Marseille rather than Argentina. God Save the Queen, played by a military band that looked like the toy soldiers in Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker, was greeted with reverential silence and it became clear as the opening match began that this was not going to be a cauldron of hate or anything remotely approaching it. In 1977, when Don Revie's England played Argentina in the Boca Juniors stadium, La Bombonera, ear-splitting whistles drowned the anthem out. By comparison this was all positively genteel. \"I thought the crowd were very fair,\" said Baker, who in the second and third sets raised his game above his ranking of No235 before losing 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 to David Nalbandian. \"I can't wait to get more of it,\" enthused the 21-year-old Scot who was playing his first live rubber and after some initial diffidence relished the occasion, unlike the hapless Bogdanovic. \"I'm used to playing on courts where there is no seating,\" said a smiling Baker, who usually competes on the Challenger circuit where even linespersons are a luxury. Baker has nothing like the talent of Bogdanovic but there is nobody who works harder to maximise his limited ability. He has never cracked the top 200, although his performance here will have given him fresh incentive. \"My basic plan was to play the best I can and then see what damage I could do to him.\" Obviously the gulf in class was readily apparent. Nalbandian began at a rush, with Baker winning only 13 points in the first set. \"On 86 it was the hand of god, on 08 it's David's,\" read a banner. In truth Nalbandian, unlike Maradona, did not need any sleight of hand and, with the opening set over in 25 minutes, there had been barely a squeak from the 30 or so British Association of Tennis Supporters, sometimes referred to as the Bats. Baker pounded away with his forehand and ran down everything he could but at crucial moments his inexperience at this level was seized upon by the Argentinian, even though it was a generally scratchy performance by the world No9. \"Against somebody of Nalbandian's class you are going to get punished,\" Baker said. Bogdanovic has had chances galore at this level, beginning in 2003 against Australia when he was a teenager. He started reasonably well against a clearly nervous Agustin Calleri, brought in to play singles because of an injury to Juan Monaco, but all too predictably he faded fast, losing 6-3, 6-1, 6-1. He may be Britain's nominally second-best player but surely John Lloyd, the captain, can no longer pick him. He simply does not have the heart for a fight. Britain' heaviest Davis Cup defeat came in this city in 1981 when every rubber was lost in straight sets, and only 41 games were won. This may turn out to be worse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
