Turns out he already knew this year's Safari vulnerability before last year's Pwn2Own contest but didn't need to use it. However, he didn't report it to Apple. He says: Vulnerabilities have a market value so it makes no sense to work hard to find a bug, write an exploit and then give it away. Apple pays people to do the same job so we know there's value to this work. No more free bugs. However, the problem with Apple security holes is that they are not worth much. While he claims he could get more than $5,000 for the one he used, he was happy to use it for the prize, the Mac, and the publicity. The IE8 vulnerability that Nils used was worth at least 10x more, Miller says. I was shocked when I saw someone sign up to go after IE 8. You can get paid a lot more than $5,000 for one of those bugs. I've talked to a lot of smart, knowledgeable people and no one knows exactly how he did it. He could easily get $50,000 for that vulnerability. I'd say $50,000 is a low-end price point. For the amount of time he spent to do what he did on IE and Firefox, he could have found and exploited five or 10 Safari bugs. With the way they're paying $5,000 for every verifiable bug, he could have spent that same time and resources and make $25,000 or $30,000 easily just by going after Safari on Mac . Chrome survived because it takes too much effort to attack it for it to be worth the money on offer. First you have to hack Chrome, but then you have to hack Chrome's sandbox: \"Now you need two bugs and two exploits,\" Miller says. \"That raises the bar.\" It's all economics. It's only hard or easy compared to what someone would pay. If Pwn2Own offered $1 million per bug for Chrome, there would be a line of people here looking to bankrupt them. Conversely, the Mac is easy to hack not just because it's relatively easy to find security holes in Safari but because they are so easy to exploit. Miller says: The things that Windows do to make it harder (for an exploit to work), Macs don't do. Hacking into Macs is so much easier. You don't have to jump through hoops and deal with all the anti-exploit mitigations you'd find in Windows. It's more about the operating system than the (target) program. Firefox on Mac is pretty easy too. The underlying OS doesn't have anti-exploit stuff built into it. Entertaining stuff, but Naraine should have asked at least two more questions. Those are: * If a Mac exploit really is worth $5,000 to a criminal buyer, what would he use it for? * Where's the real-world evidence that anyone has made $5,000 plus profits by exploiting a Mac security hole? I can't see any."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
