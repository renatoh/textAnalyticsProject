A report by the public accounts committee found that past decisions delaying maintenance at the MoD\u2019s 13 sites that support nuclear submarines had left the programme \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. The Trident nuclear missile programme could also be adversely affected by Brexit because of the reliance on imported material from EU countries and difficulties bringing engineers from the continent, Friday\u2019s report said. Defence chiefs must bridge a \u00a32.9bn black hole and fill a skills gap if they are to maintain the current deterrent, according to the influential cross-party committee. The report comes four months after Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, pledged to spend \u00a32.5bn on the UK\u2019s submarine programme. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said that with the MoD already facing a crisis over the delivery of its new aircraft carriers and a potential \u00a320bn shortfall in its equipment programme, there are \u201cserious questions\u201d over its ability to meet its national security commitments. \u201cThe MoD must now bridge an affordability gap running to nearly \u00a33bn, fill critical skill gaps and ensure its supply chain is maintained effectively \u2013 all at a time of significant uncertainty in international politics and trade. \u201cI am particularly concerned that the infrastructure available to support the nuclear enterprise is not fit for purpose. \u201cThe MoD admits that while it has previously put off dismantling submarines on grounds of cost, this is no longer acceptable on grounds of safety and reputation. The MoD needs to get on top of this quickly,\u201d she said. Over the next 10 years, the MoD is expected to spend \u00a351bn on the nuclear enterprise \u2013 the network of programmes, equipment and people maintaining and replacing the submarine fleet, including the Vanguard-class submarines that carry the UK\u2019s nuclear missiles. MPs warned \u201cincorrect\u201d assumptions in the past about the infrastructure required meant the MoD did not have the berthing space it needed at Devonport naval base, where maintenance and defuelling of the submarines is carried out. They said the MoD had deferred work on dismantling old submarines that had been taken out of service on affordability grounds and there was now a backlog of 20 vessels waiting to be disposed of, including nine that still contained nuclear fuel. To date, the UK has never completely disposed of an old nuclear submarine and while work has begun on the first it is not due to be finished until the mid-2020s. The committee said work on defuelling the next submarine was due to begin around the same time, and that the disposals programme was expected to last \u201cat least a couple of decades\u201d. The MoD acknowledged that the UK\u2019s departure from the EU could affect its supply chain and is examining potential risks, the report said. Civil servants told MPs that they recognised that since the UK imports material from some EU countries, Brexit may affect prices and the regulation of chemicals used in the nuclear programme. Nuclear engineers could also become harder to recruit, a senior MoD official told the committee. In this financial year alone, 14% of the MoD\u2019s total budget is expected to go on nuclear programmes, adding up to \u00a35.2bn. In December, Mark Sedwill, the UK\u2019s national security adviser, suggested that the government could shift the cost of the deterrent from the MoD\u2019s budget. An MoD spokeswoman said the UK\u2019s nuclear programmes are some of the most complex engineering projects ever undertaken by the defence industry, and support thousands of jobs. \u201cWe are committed to delivering these nuclear programmes on time and within budget and will carefully consider the recommendations in this report to ensure this remains the case. \u201cWe continue to press ahead with our dismantling projects. Work is underway to enhance our infrastructure so our programmes continue to run at the highest standards,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
