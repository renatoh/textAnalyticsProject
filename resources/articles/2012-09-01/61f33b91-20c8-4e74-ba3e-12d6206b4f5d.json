These films put Universal Studios on the map and also kept them going through some very hard times. It's taken an age for them to get the hi-def, Blu-ray treatment, but the wait is justified when you see what a truly amazing job has been done here. They look alive \u2026 ALIVE! Dracula, Frankenstein, The Bride Of Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, The Creature From The Black Lagoon (with a 3D version included), The Mummy, The Invisible Man, The Phantom Of The Opera: these films, spanning the 1930s to 50s, are an entertaining crash-course in film history and a much-needed slap in the face to those who think old means boring and slow. The studio system has been subject to a lot of bad-mouthing over the years, but these films show how it actually used to be a good thing. Directors like James Whale, actors like Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains, makeup men like Jack Pierce \u2026 all these talents did their best work for Universal; the flat-headed Karloff Frankenstein's monster is one of the defining images of cinema. They're playful, odd and experimental movies with an amazing hand-crafted feel; far from the smug and scare-free stuff that passes as horror these days. Blu-ray, Universal Bond 50 Ah, come in all 22 James Bond movies on Blu-ray \u2013 we've been expecting you. A great value 50th anniversary boxset. Blu-ray, MGM Das Testament Des Dr Mabuse Fritz Lang's compelling and cryptic classic about an insane criminal mastermind. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, Eureka Spartacus: Vengeance All the gory glory of the Roman empire, Spartacus delivers another perfect season of mayhem and intrigue. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, Anchor Bay Fringe Season 4 Parallel worlds collide as this great science-fiction show continues to explore its unique mythology.
