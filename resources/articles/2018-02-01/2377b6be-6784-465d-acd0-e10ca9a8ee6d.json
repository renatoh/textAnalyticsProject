But rather than a LeBron James dunk or Steph Curry three-pointer, the answer appears to have been found with the Black Eyed Peas\u2019 Fergie, who strangled the national anthem half to death in the pre-game ceremonies. While most guest singers attempt to turn the Star-Spangled Banner into a rousing anthem, Fergie gave the song a sultry edge \u2013 with interesting results. Several of the players, most notably the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Draymond Green, appeared to be holding back laughter. Tthe hilarity went on for a while. When the game\u2019s US broadcaster, TNT, cut to its halftime show, the panel was still chuckling. Charles Barkley commented: \u201cI need a cigarette after that.\u201d His fellow NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O\u2019Neal described the performance as \u201csexy\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d. Roseanne Barr, who was panned for her own rendition of the anthem at a San Diego Padres game in the 1990s, gave her own opinion. \u201cWho saw Fergie\u2019s national anthem performance at the NBA All Star Game? I think mine was better lowkey,\u201d wrote the comedian on Twitter. Ssome on Twitter thought Fergie\u2019s inspirations for her rendition were Jessica Rabbit and Marilyn Monroe. On Monday, Fergie acknowledged the anthem wasn\u2019t her finest work. \u201cI\u2019m a risk-taker, artistically, but clearly this rendition didn\u2019t strike the intended tone. I love this country and honestly tried my best,\u201d she told TMZ. As for the game itself, Team LeBron beat Team Stephen 148-145. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said he was happy with the new format, in which two players draft their own roster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
