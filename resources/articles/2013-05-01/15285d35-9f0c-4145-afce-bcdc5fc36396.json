It doesn't always rain in Seattle. Between July and October there's nothing but sun. Lots of people in Seattle hate the sun. We burn easily, break out in hives, draw the blinds \u2026 That's why there is music like this, for those who run for the shady spot and can't wait for winter. (Lucy) The Fall-Outs \u2013 Zombie There used to be a lot of punk rock clubs in Seattle. Now most of them have turned into cocktail lounges where you can get small plates. To share. Punk rock does not need small plates. (Lucy) The Fastbacks \u2013 Impatience The peacock at the Woodland Park zoo in Seattle is really loud. Its call can be heard a mile away. The Fastbacks were loud too. They played a summer show at the zoo once. Not really \u2013 they played punk rock shows at punk rock clubs. Maybe they're afraid of the sun. (Lucy) Flop \u2013 Hello Flop is my favourite band from Seattle. I went to see them more than any other group and every show was a blast. Hooks, power, emotion and a beer-soaked irreverent attitude, they should have been huge. They are to me. (Chris) Silkworm \u2013 Slipstream Silkworm started in Montana, ended up in Chicago, but did my favourite stuff while they were in Seattle in the 1990s. I don't really think of them for individual songs but as an entire package. I picked their first single but it could have been any of their songs. They were a really polarising band: people either loved them or hated them. Seattle was busy praising a bunch of bullshit at the time. (Chris) Unnatural Helpers \u2013 Gettin' Classy I was in this band for a couple years and my good friend Dean is the mastermind. I didn't play on the album this song is from, their first. I was just a hired hand anyway (who didn't get paid). Awesome songs that are under two minutes, verse, chorus, done. One of the top live bands in Seattle nowadays. (Chris) Screaming Trees \u2013 Transfiguration Ellensburg is famous for its yearly rodeo and for Screaming Trees. They were the first band I ever saw in Seattle, as an east coast transplant in 1987. I have a vision of them on stage, Mark Lanegan flanked by the Conner brothers, and the incredible energy they exuded. What a memorable welcome to the Pacific Northwest. (Matthew) Mudhoney \u2013 In 'n' Out of Grace \"We want to be free to ride our machines without being hassled by the man.\" What could possibly say road trip better than that? (Matthew) Beat Happening \u2013 Foggy Eyes My wife went to high school with Calvin [Johnson] in Olympia, WA, but I always preferred the songs that Heather [Lewis] sang. (Matthew) The Purdins \u2013 Plane Flying Over My Head Georgetown is in the south end of Seattle, near Boeing, so there are always planes screaming overhead. It's a lot more attractive nowadays, with loads of new bars and shops opening up every year. But in the early 1990s, it was still dingy and dirty, with only a few watering holes like the old Jules Maes Saloon. The kind of place that made you wish you had a switchblade. But the neighbourhood was one of the better places in town you could find cheap studio space. This song captures for me how moody and bummed out living through the endless Seattle winters can make you. But in a way that you actually like it. \"There's a plane flying over my head I sure do wish I was on it. This winter's almost over, I can feel it getting warmer, I guess I might stay here after all.\" (Barrett) Heart \u2013 Crazy on You Everybody's heard this song. But it's so awesome, and sometimes reminds me of being a paperboy and delivering newspapers to Nancy Wilson's cool Interlaken estate. Sadly, I never caught a glimpse of the guitar rock queen. (Barrett) The Sonics \u2013 The Witch Hello, it's 1965. Such handsome lads, what college are they in? Oh, here, says they are from Tacoma, but this says it's recorded in neighbouring Seattle. Let's listen to \"Here Are The Sonics\". Oh, my ... it's distorted. Was this recorded in a garage? (Barrett) \u2022 Kinski's Cosy Moments was released in April 2013 on Kill Rock Stars. Lucy Atkinson (bass), Chris Martin (guitar/vocals), Matthew Reid Schwartz (guitar/keyboard), Barrett Wilke (drums) \u2022 For more information on holidays in the USA, visit DiscoverAmerica.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
