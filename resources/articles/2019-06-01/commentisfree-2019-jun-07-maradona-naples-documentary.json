I was there", "bodyText": "Sundays would begin and end at a bar called Bollicine \u2013 bubbles \u2013 behind Piazza Leopardi station in the Fuorigrotta quarter of Naples. It was kept by a man called Enzo Cosenza, who also led choreography and singing in the city\u2019s football stadium. That\u2019s where we spent the time in between, across the span of two years with season tickets, watching Diego Maradona defy the laws of gravity and physics with a football. I was working in Rome, but commuting from Naples for romantic reasons, and I soon fell in love with Maradona as well. Ahead of Asif Kapadia\u2019s much-anticipated documentary on the Maradona phenomenon, released next week, the talk is once again about Diego. The film turns the pages of a marvellous scrapbook, but doesn\u2019t convey how Maradona and Naples shared a common heartbeat and soul. To understand Maradona in those days was to understand Naples, and vice versa: the same unearthly magic, the same brilliant light, the same maleficient shadows. In 1984, SSC Napoli played a stratum below Europe\u2019s soccer powerhouses and wasn\u2019t the obvious destination for a global football star. And this was long before Elena Ferrante and mass tourism: Naples was a place through which visitors hurried to the Amalfi coast, clutching their wallets, often in vain. Yet it was the perfect place for Maradona: every Neapolitan felt the hand of God in Maradona\u2019s arrival among them. By wresting the city\u2019s first ever championship titles from the hated, hitherto dominant, teams of the rich north, Maradona incarnated the rebellious pride and elan of the poorer south. \u201cHere come the Neapolitans \u2013 what a stench! Even the dogs run away,\u201d visiting Milanese fans would sing. \u201cCholerati! Terremottati!\u201d\u2013 cholera-ridden, \u201cearthquaked\u201d. And from our beloved Curva B end of the stadium, led by Cosenza, came the reply: \u201cMamma, why does my heart beat so? Because I\u2019ve seen Maradona, I\u2019m in love.\u201d I was in the Curva B the night Italy faced Argentina in the 1990 World Cup semi-final in Naples, when Maradona\u2019s national team shattered the host country\u2019s fairytale. And there was salt in the wound: \u201cNapoli non \u00e8 Italia\u201d (\u201cNaples isn\u2019t Italy\u201d) Maradona had insisted, urging that the Ultras commit treason and support Argentina. They did, and were never forgiven. But there was logic to the choice; a thread of Parthenopean identity reaching back from the Bourbon Kingdom of Two Sicilies to vengeance in the present by the messiah from Buenos Aires. The synergy between player and city cut still deeper. Naples exists on a faultline and in the shadow of a volcano, in close proximity to the cults of death and after-life, replete with what northern Europeans and Protestants call superstition. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you missed,\u201d read graffiti on a cemetery wall after the second championship in 1990, when celebrations lasted three nights. \u201cHow do you know we missed it?\u201d came a retort. I knew Neapolitans who read cards in earnest, and interpreted dreams with numeric systems. Before the tourists, the canyon-street of peeling stucco called Spaccanapoli was lined with wart-faced marionettes, masks and pulcinelle harlequins, steeped in folklore. Catholicism in Naples can be richly occult: in the chapel of Sansevero, the marble veil over Christ\u2019s body is so impossibly thin it must have been draped over him and turned to stone by magic, so they say; in a crypt below are the skeletal remains of a couple whose vascular systems are petrified by an 18th-century alchemist\u2019s experiment. What\u2019s this got to do with Maradona? Everything. Maradona practised sorcery on the pitch; he played voodoo football. Maradona could mind-read and outwit a spellbound opponent\u2019s motive before he knew it himself. No player can be a team, but Maradona\u2019s sixth sense infused those alongside him; his captaincy was seance, as was his communion with Naples. Maradona played pagan football for a pagan city, and that was why it loved him. Then there was the dark side. Spending half my life in Naples, it was impossible to avoid, and avoid writing about, the Camorra. These were years of sorpasso \u2013 overtaking \u2013 of Sicily\u2019s Cosa Nostra by the less hierarchical, opportunistic syndicates of what Roberto Saviano later immortalised as \u201cGomorra\u201d. Both Maradona\u2019s work and mine became porous \u2013 like so much else in Naples \u2013 to toxic omnipresence. I wrote exponentially more about the Camorra\u2019s bloodletting and entwinement with a terrifying power machine operated by the Christian Democrat party, while Maradona, in his eagerness to please and be pleased, was ensnared by the mafia, drinking champagne in a cockleshell bath and frequenting a Camorra joint called the Airone piano bar. Himself a boy of the barrio, Maradona\u2019s story was now both inspiration and cautionary tale: he celebrated the fact that exploitation of his trademark in \u201cunofficial merchandise\u201d gave work \u201cto the poor children of Naples\u201d \u2013 the mafia as Robin Hood \u2013 and willingly accepted the Camorra\u2019s currencies of cocaine and prostitutes. He got them, and they got him, in equal measure. So on weekdays between watching him play, I found myself at work on Maradona and the Camorra, listening to his voice on police wiretaps. One morning a Camorra madam called Donna Carmela Cinquegrana put her son Cristino on the line for a chat with his football idol, before procuring two prostitutes for the footballer that night. Italian has no word for \u201cprivacy\u201d, and in the tatty baroque courtyards and apartment blocks of Naples there is none, whether Maradona craved it or not. Naples adulated but devoured him. I interviewed a man called Pepe who had known Maradona well, and to whom he had confessed: \u201cI\u2019m not a saint, I\u2019m a football player.\u201d Diego Maradona fell, as Italians say, \u201cdalle stelle alle stalle\u201d, from the stars to the stables. Having arrived by helicopter into a stadium packed with 75,000 just to greet him, he was now summoned for interview by magistrates and fled Naples ignominiously. The city without Maradona felt, I wrote then, \u201clike a deck of cards stripped of both its joker and its ace\u201d. But Naples adored him too much to feel betrayed; besides, Maradona had shared its vulnerabilities and pain, as well as caused its deliverance. But Maradona remains in Naples\u2019 heart as he always was: enchanter, saviour, talisman, wizard. His portrait adorns wretched apartment blocks, his maquette figurine is ubiquitous. The city has never really recovered from Maradona since the moment someone wrote, the day after his departure, on a wall in the tumbledown Forcella quarter: \u201cDiego Facci Ancora Sognare\u201d \u2013 \u201cDiego, make us dream again\u201d. \u2022 Ed Vulliamy was the Guardian\u2019s Italy correspondent from 1989-1994"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
