Foley has strenuously denied the allegations. But Labor is now \u201cwatching cautiously\u201d as the Coalition ramps up its attacks, raising the matter in federal Senate estimates this week after first raising it in the NSW parliament. Foley denied the incident took place and noted that no formal complaint had been made to the ABC by the journalist who was alleged to have been at the centre of the incident. This was confirmed by the ABC\u2019s acting managing director, David Anderson, in estimates. He has asked for a brief on the alleged incident after allegations were raised in NSW parliament last week. Under questioning by the federal Liberal senator Eric Abetz on Tuesday night, Anderson promised a thorough investigation of allegations. There have been calls for Foley to stand aside pending an outcome of the investigation. But in parliament on Tuesday, Foley threatened to dish dirt on at least four government politicians. \u201cWe would welcome such a debate, but we would amend it to talk about you and you and you and you,\u201d he yelled in parliament, pointing his finger at ministers one at a time. The alleged incident reportedly took place at the Martin Place Bar after the NSW press gallery Christmas party in 2016 and involved one of the ABC staff covering state politics. NSW will go to an election in March next year, and recent polls have indicated that the opposition is now neck and neck with the Berejiklian government, which has been dogged by a stream of news on infrastructure projects running late. At the hearing, Anderson was questioned by Abetz over why the ABC had not investigated the alleged incident when it was raised with the ABC media team by a News Corp reporter on 2 May. Anderson told Senate estimates that there had been no formal sexual harassment claim or complaint made at the ABC about the incident, and that he had only learned of the incident when it was raised in the NSW parliament last week. \u201cWe do take it seriously and we will investigate,\u201d Anderson said. Abetz asked whether the investigation would include talking to the journalist\u2019s colleagues about the alleged incident. \u201cYes, we will definitely be looking at this,\u201d Anderson replied. Abetz said it had appeared that the victim had been moved on, and asked Anderson to investigate. Anderson said he would take that on notice. Last week the NSW corrections minister, David Elliott, put the allegations on the record using parliamentary privilege, telling the chamber Foley had \u201charassed an ABC journalist\u201d after having \u201ca little bit too much to drink at a party\u201d. Foley has invited Elliott to step out of the \u201ccoward\u2019s castle\u201d and repeat his claim, branding them a smear by a government that is in trouble in the polls. \u201cThe allegations are untrue and Mr Elliott made them under parliamentary privilege,\u201d a spokesman for Foley said. \u201cWere he to repeat them outside the parliament, Mr Foley will be forced to sue him.\u201d Allegations of a similar nature brought an abrupt end to the career of the former Liberal opposition leader John Brogden in 2005. Brogden resigned as leader and the next day tried to take his own life. He has since left politics and is the chairman of Lifeline."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
