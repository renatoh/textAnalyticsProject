The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the gross domestic product figures on Wednesday, confirming that growth has slowed from 0.6% in seasonally adjusted chain volume terms in the June quarter although yearly growth has ticked up from a revised figure of 1.6%. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the figures showed the Australian economy was \u201cremarkably resilient\u201d in the face of global headwinds such as trade tensions,and local conditions including drought. Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra the government would continue to \u201cstay the course\u201d in seeking the first budget surplus in 12 years. Scott Morrison said he was \u201cpleased\u201d by the figures, which Labor\u2019s Jim Chalmers labelled \u201can outrage\u201d. Despite government hopes this quarter would see a bounce off the back of tax cuts for low and middle income earners of up to $1,080, household expenditure increased by just 0.1% due to weak spending on discretionary goods and services. Household gross disposable income increased by 2.5% due to the tax cuts and lower mortgage repayments after three interest rate cuts this year. But households did not chose to boost spending \u2013 instead discretionary spending fell 0.3% and the savings ratio rose to 4.8%. While mining investment declined 7.8% this quarter and 11.2% through the year, government final consumption expenditure rose 0.9% in the quarter and remains strong through the year at 6.0%. ABS chief economist, Bruce Hockman, said: \u201cThe economy has continued to grow, however the rate of growth remains well below the long run average.\u201d \u201cThe reduction to tax payable did not translate to a rise in discretionary spending, which led to a visible impact to household saving.\u201d Frydenberg conceded he would \u201clike consumption to be higher\u201d but put a positive spin on the savings rate, suggesting that households paying down debt would allow them to spend more later. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the government had suffered \u201ctotal humiliation\u201d due to the weaker-than-expected result, telling reporters that \u201cclearly the tax cuts are not doing the job\u201d. \u201cJosh Frydenberg keeps lowering the bar and keeps tripping over it. The test isn\u2019t if there is any growth in the economy at all \u2013 the test is whether there is enough growth to boost wages.\u201d Chalmers suggested the government should consider a business investment tax incentive among other measures to boost growth. Earlier, Frydenberg said the government is in discussions with business about possible initiatives but refused to say if they could be contained in the mid-year economic and fiscal update due later in December. The Reserve Bank has suggested the Australia economy is at a \u201cgentle turning point\u201d after disappointing annual growth figures of just 1.4% in the year to June \u2013 the lowest recorded annual rate since 2009. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that growth will return to 2.3% in 2020. Although the Morrison government has attempted to stimulate the economy by accelerating infrastructure spending, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have persisted with a contractionary fiscal policy in the hope of banking a surplus. Capital Economics senior Australian and New Zealand economist Marcel Thieliant said the \u201csubdued rise in GDP\u201d \u2013 lower than the Bloomberg consensus of 0.5% and a \u201cmarked slowdown\u201d from the last quarter of 0.6% \u2013 meant the RBA \u201cwill have to provide more stimulus before long\u201d. \u201cParticularly disappointing was the measly 0.1% [quarter on quarter] increase in private consumption. \u201cThis was the slowest increase since the global financial crisis and underlines that the government\u2019s tax cuts aren\u2019t providing any boost to consumer spending.\u201d \u201cWhile the 0.7% quarterly fall in private investment wasn\u2019t as bad as we had anticipated, the RBA\u2019s forecast that it will be rising by 3.2% by year-end looks wide of the mark.\u201d Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics, agreed that the figures showed \u201cchronic weakness in household spending\u201d and \u201cno sign yet\u201d that the increase in tax offsets and rate cuts are supporting consumption. Hunter also noted that private investment was weak, with dwelling investment down 1.7% this quarter, although \u201cthere was some good news from the housing market\u201d, with an increase of 4.5% spending on ownership transfer costs such as conveyancing and real estate agents indicating a recovery. \u201cBroadly speaking, today\u2019s data confirms our view that on an annualised basis the pace of growth is broadly likely to hold around 2% for the next 12 months.\u201d With the official cash rate currently sitting at 0.75%, the Reserve Bank governor, Phil Lowe, has suggested the central bank could make two further cuts to 0.25% before it would consider creating money to buy government bonds as it runs out of levers to boost the economy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
