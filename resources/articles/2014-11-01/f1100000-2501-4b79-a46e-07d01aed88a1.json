But in the basement of a small house \u2013 Big Pink \u2013 near Woodstock in upstate New York, Bob Dylan was holed up with his backing band, a group of mostly Canadian dropouts known as the Hawks, inadvertently creating history. A year earlier he\u2019d been in a motorbike accident, the facts of which are much disputed. Now the arch self-mythologist was in semi-seclusion. He no longer toured. But he and his band recorded daily, sometimes 10 songs in a session. Nearly half a century later, the complete 138-song archive of Dylan\u2019s exploration into American roots music is set to be released on Tuesday. The Basement Tapes Complete: The Bootleg Series Vol 11 will provoke a fresh appraisal of the rock giant\u2019s work. But it will also prompt bittersweet memories for one of the closest members of his entourage, whose appearance alongside Dylan on the cover of an early album provided one of modern music\u2019s most enduring images. Other than the musicians on the tapes, few had better insight into the Dylan of 1967 than Sally Grossman, wife of the singer\u2019s late manager Albert Grossman. She posed for the cover of Bringing It All Back Home wearing a long red dress, cigarette in hand. Her home near Woodstock was the locus of life for dozens of musicians managed by her husband, including Dylan, Janis Joplin and the Hawks (later known as the Band). The Band\u2019s keyboard player, Garth Hudson, once gave her the \u201cBasement Tapes\u201d for safekeeping. \u201cIt sounded like throwaway stuff. Nonsense stuff. Bob and the guys were hanging out, playing and having fun,\u201d Grossman told the Observer. \u201cThe titles alone are enough of a clue. The Mighty Quinn, Mrs Henry, Lo &amp; Behold! Bob wasn\u2019t playing the songs live. The Band wasn\u2019t. They weren\u2019t thinking these were songs for release.\u201d Grossman recalls being invited to Big Pink late in the sessions to hear some material. Dylan wasn\u2019t touring or recording, so the management was keen to get his new work covered by other acts. To welcome the visitors, the girlfriend of one of the musicians had baked a cake. \u201cThey played the tape and almost immediately Albert looks at me and says, we gotta go,\u201d Grossman remembers. He was allergic to the buckwheat flour in the cake. \u201cIt was a joke with the guys for years. They thought Albert hated the music so much he\u2019d got up and split.\u201d Even Dylan, when he finally commented on the songs in 1984, said he\u2019d never really liked them. \u201cThey were just songs we had done for the publishing company, as I remember. I wouldn\u2019t have put \u2019em out.\u201d Scraps began to leak out on bootleg albums. A partial release in the mid-70s failed to satisfy Dylanologists. According to Sony, 30 tracks on the new set have never got out, leaked or otherwise. But do they answer the larger question about Dylan\u2019s purpose? His switch from folk to rock two years earlier was self-explanatory, says Grossman. \u201cBob liked Elvis Presley and figured rock\u2019n\u2019roll was going to be more fun. Besides, how far could he go with that folk music thing?\u201d Dylan had been on the road for most of 1965 into 1966. He\u2019d released three astonishing albums back to back. He was exhausted, and probably addicted to amphetamines. Woodstock beckoned. Then, in early August 1966, word came that he had crashed his Triumph. Was it true? Though Dylan still refers to an accident, there are doubts it even took place. Some accounts place Dylan under the care of a doctor specialising in detoxification. \u201cIt was sort of dubious \u2013 oh, now you can\u2019t see him?\u201d speculates one of the bootleggers behind Motorcycle, an early, pirated edition of the Big Pink songs. \u201cHe was in the house trying to come down. He\u2019d been on quite a run.\u201d Grossman, whose husband later fell out with Dylan over management fees and music publishing, has previously cast doubt on the entire incident, saying she remembers the singer leaving her house in Bearsville that morning, 29 July, and returning a few minutes later. Still, Dylan was clearly looking to discard his prior, nocturnal life in the milieu of the Chelsea Hotel, Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick. He even left a painting Warhol had given him \u2013 a Double Elvis silkscreen \u2013 that would ultimately deepen the rift with his former manager. The Band were instinctive musicians, wild hillbillies who partied every night and drove their cars off the road \u2013 everything Dylan wasn\u2019t. The following spring, Dylan and the Band began to play. \u201cBob was a middle-class kid. He\u2019d arrived in New York and impressed the literati \u2013 Pete Seeger, folk archivist Alan Lomax \u2013 the rich kids. The Harvard crowd,\u201d says Grossman. \u201cWoody Guthrie, who was middle class, came to town and suddenly they\u2019re all saying \u2018hey\u2019 and \u2018howdy\u2019. Then Bob comes up with much the same thing.\u201d But playing with the Canadians was different. They weren\u2019t psychedelic or heavy rock but their back-to-the-roots style was prescient. \u201cThese guys played from the gut and for Bob to be with them must have been very refreshing.\u201d By the time the tapes started seeping out, the peace-and-love revolution had soured and the Kent State massacre \u2013 the shooting of unarmed college students by the Ohio National Guard on 4 May 1970, killing four and wounding nine \u2013 was around the corner. The music by then was a reminder of how things might have been. Dylan, true to form, isn\u2019t commenting. Band guitarist Robbie Robertson says there\u2019s another twist in the story \u2013 but he\u2019s keeping it for the autobiography. Legendary recordings, certainly. Ephemera, also. The sound on the Basement Tapes, says Grossman, is simply musicians \u201ctrying to work it out\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
