And it\u2019s working", "bodyText": "Last week I chose three constituencies to give out my \u201cteacher\u2019s plea\u201d leaflet : Zac Goldsmith\u2019s Richmond Park, Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s disparate Chingford and Woodford Green. I have since been dragging myself out of bed at 5am on pitch-black, literally freezing cold mornings to catch the first wave of train commuters before our work days begin. Beneath bundles of gloves and woollens I beam out, \u201cMorning! Teacher\u2019s plea!\u201d to the commuters and parents on the school run. The leaflet explains, \u201cI am witnessing our schools nosedive into serious crisis. Please, think carefully about your vote this election.\u201d I go on to tell them, in 25 compact lines, how \u201cutterly ruthlessly the Conservatives have slashed our budgets and starved our funding. It is relentless and we are kidding ourselves if we think the repercussions aren\u2019t going to be felt in future generations through crime, mental health &amp; unemployment.\u201d The last lines get \u201cpolitical\u201d. I highlight how we have to put personal politics aside, it is our duty to vote tactically to become non-Conservative. Sometimes people refuse a leaflet and roll their eyes, but upon seeing every second commuter reading one on their platform, they often return keen to be privy to the mysterious note. A dad dropping off his child once sought me out: \u201cThey\u2019re all talking about your leaflet you know. Even the Tory supporters. I\u2019ll take a couple extra. Hard to ignore when it\u2019s a real person.\u201d Watching him and each potential Tory voter read the leaflet in huddled groups and in packed train carriages is worth every frozen finger and angry glare. One evening, a woman \u2013 and she turned out not to be the last \u2013 returned to me with tears in her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how bad it\u2019s gotten,\u201d she responded soberly, clutching her toddler tightly. She wanted reassurance it wasn\u2019t \u201creally like this\u201d, but then offered a promise not to vote Tory when I assured her it actually was. This is when I in turn realised that we aren\u2019t all reading the same tired tropes about Tory cuts. We may shop in the same supermarkets and send our kids to the same schools, but we aren\u2019t all exposed to the same news. I assumed we\u2019d all read about outstanding and long-serving teachers breaking down and leaving (I can now include myself in this); about book budgets, school trips, teaching assistants and librarians becoming a thing of the past; about tens of thousands of students being in \u201csupersized\u201d classes of 31-plus. Teachers feel powerless and angry in the face of all the hard work we do within the walls of our under-funded unit. I actually wrote my leaflet less than 48 hours ahead of the last election. I realised: I had to tell people about stories too serious to be lost within the Twittersphere or confined to staffroom walls. Voters, especially the undecided and unaware, needed to hear them. I had handed out my haphazard pieces of A5 flimsy paper in my swing constituency, Twickenham, to any passer-by who would take them. It was a faff doing it around my working day. Two days later, Twickenham confidently re-elected its Lib Dem MP, Vince Cable. But I soon found out that across the river, the Conservative Goldsmith had won by a painfully narrow 45 votes in Richmond. So, readers, here\u2019s an extension to my plea.. We rightfully feel disempowered in this global power game. But what do you know: one voice and a commonplace experience can be heard over the retweets, the countless colour-coded leaflets and the news headlines. You could be the local voice, whether you are a teacher, nurse or just a frustrated human being, that seizes the next 24 or even 12 hours. Get out there, print and hand something out. Tell your real stories \u2013 people are surprisingly thirsty to hear them. And for every reluctant passer-by, so many return to hear more, congratulating your initiative and catching the infectious vitality about it all. It\u2019s worth it, trust me. Be the grinning human that cracks their understandable apathy. I realised, not dressed in red, blue, yellow or green or armed with shiny printouts, that being a real person offering a story of mutual care for our community\u2019s welfare, works. We\u2019ve only got a couple of days left and preventing a Tory majority might actually be possible. \u2022 Ruthie Bubis is a former English teacher at a pupil referral unit and mainstream schools in and around London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
