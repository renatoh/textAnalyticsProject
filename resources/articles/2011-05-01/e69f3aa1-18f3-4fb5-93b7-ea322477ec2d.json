He crashed heavily on the descent from Monday's main climb, Passo del Bocco, lost a large volume of blood and never regained consciousness. As with coal miners and fishermen, life on the professional cycling circuit is one of shared and mutually appreciated danger. Not all the peloton can have known Weylandt but they will ride out on Tuesday for stage four along the Tuscan coast to Livorno in the knowledge that what happened to him could have happened to any one of their number. The risks he took were routine, taken by a rider who was very much one of the pack. Weylandt was a journeyman professional, 26 years old, faster than average with a number of sprint wins to his credit, and this was an everyday descent \u2013 technical admittedly, but no worse than many others \u2013 on a routine stage. That explains in part the expressions of dismay and grief from his fellows and from cycling fans. The same feelings were present at the last death of a cyclist in one of the major Tours, the fatal accident to Fabio Casartelli in the 1995 Tour, but Twitter on Monday enabled feelings to be expressed more rapidly and more widely. There will be a tribute of some kind to the Belgian, beginning with a minute's silence at the stage start and possibly including something similar to the peloton's ceremonial parade through the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es that marked Casartelli's death. That remains one of the most impressive displays of shared emotion ever seen on a cycle race and, if the tributes included one from Lance Armstrong, that should come as no surprise: the Texan, then 23, was one of Casartelli's team-mates during the 1995 Tour and he paid an intense, personal tribute a few days later in winning the stage to Limoges. \"We will respect whatever decision the riders and Wouter's team, Leopard Trek, will take,\" the race director, Angelo Zomegnan, said, adding that the race had already planned to show respect for an incident in December in which a group of seven amateur cyclists were killed by a car. \"Now, sadly, we have to pay homage to one more rider,\" he said. \"It is up to [Leopard Trek] to decide. But there will be no festive music or the usual celebrations, whatever happens.\" Zomegnan added that the riders \"risk their lives in every single metre of the course\" and was echoed by the Scot David Millar who said Wouter's death \"shows what cycling is about. It's pretty extreme. There's no point even dedicating anything to Wouter, because it doesn't even come close to making up for what has happened. The bottom line is that the guys here are the best cyclists in the world, and the best guys in the world can have a mechanical [fault] or find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" Weylandt is only the fourth cyclist to die of a crash on the Giro and only three have suffered that fate on the Tour de France. However, potentially life-threatening accidents occur far more frequently, such as the 2009 Giro crash in which the Spaniard Pedro Horrillo fell 60 metres into a ravine, after which he had to be put into an induced coma. The riders staged a go-slow in protest after that event and something similar happened after a spate of crashes on a descent in the Ardennes during the 2010 Tour de France. Casartelli's death led to a debate around helmet use in cycling that had no immediate outcome and it took a further death, that of the Kazakh Andrei Kivilev in the 2003 Paris-Nice before their use became compulsory. It is the second time in recent years that Belgium has been hit, following the death of the Spaniard Isaac G\u00e1lvez in the Ghent Six-Day track race in 2006. Those incidents came after the helmet rule came in and serve as a tragic reminder that, no matter what precautions are taken, cycling remains a sport of risk and its practitioners, amateur and professional, race in the full knowledge of that fact."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
