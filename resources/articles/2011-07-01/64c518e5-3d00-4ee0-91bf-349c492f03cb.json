Amnesty TV will be a fortnightly, 15-minute, online, magazine-style show that will blend satirical comedy with documentaries and news about human rights campaigns around the globe. The producers behind TV shows The Inbetweeners, Starsuckers and Newswipe have put together the first episode for broadcast on Friday at amnestytv.co.uk and via YouTube. It will feature Aung San Suu Kyi, with a special message recorded to mark 50 years of Amnesty, as well as an item from Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, who will deliver a polemic on internet freedom in front of a group of children who are making a collage of China's recent history of censorship. Speaking to the Observer this weekend, Wales said: \"It was very exciting and interesting for me. Amnesty arranged for me to go and meet and talk with schoolchildren about issues of freedom of speech in China. I was able to show them a photo of me with Ai Weiwei and to tell them that he had recently been released. For the kids it makes it all more human to see things like that,\" he said. Wales added that the growth of the internet had offered a great new tool for human rights campaigners. \"Even in places which are being difficult about freedom of speech, the internet means it is coming to them more and more. \"It ebbs and flows, of course. The authorities crack down and then it loosens up again. And the great thing is that no country can ever do without the internet. You can't turn it off because it is quite necessary for modern life and, as long as it is there, people will use it to talk,\" said Wales. Amnesty was founded after English lawyer Peter Benenson wrote an impassioned article in the Observer, entitled \"The Forgotten Prisoners\", highlighting the plight of people who had been jailed for peacefully expressing their views. Published in 1961, it provoked a flood of responses from Observer readers. Within weeks Benenson's \"Appeal for Amnesty\" had drawn support from groups in several countries. Since then, Amnesty has secured the release of thousands of prisoners of conscience. \"I am a big fan of Amnesty's work,\" said Wales. \"I find it incredibly useful for providing a central clearing house of information about what is going on in the world.\" Speaking about the launch, Amnesty's Andy Hackman said: \"Amnesty International's aim is to connect people and unite them behind a common belief that people coming together can effect real, tangible change. Amnesty TV's combination of entertaining content and inspiring stories will help us engage and mobilise a new generation of supporters.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
