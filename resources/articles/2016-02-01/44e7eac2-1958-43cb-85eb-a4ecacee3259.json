She said she felt the need to please Ghomeshi and placate him after a crime for which she blamed herself. But on Friday, defense lawyers for Ghomeshi confronted DeCoutere with a series of messages the witness said she had forgotten and, as a result, did not show to police or prosecutors. In a handwritten letter days after the assault, she writes: \u201cI love your hands.\u201d DeCoutere has accused the former CBC host of choking and slapping her while the two were on a date in 2003. She is one of three women testifying against Ghomeshi in this trial and the only one who has allowed herself to be named publicly. \u201cWomen can be assaulted and still having positive feelings for them afterward,\u201d DeCoutere said Friday, in response to reading the messages. According to the CBC, she added: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that he assaulted me and I never gave consent to him.\u201d Ghomeshi, 48, has pleaded not guilty to four counts of sexual assault and one count of choking, based on alleged incidents involving three women including DeCoutere. Police launched an investigation in 2014 after nine women contacted various media sources to allege that Ghomeshi had assaulted them. The allegations rocked Canada\u2019s vaunted public broadcaster and sparked a nationwide conversation about consent and sexual harassment. Ghomeshi, who first gained fame as a member of the 1990s satirical pop band Moxy Fruvous, previously defended himself in a 1,500-word statement on Facebook, saying women consented to having \u201crough sex\u201d and that he was the victim of a disgruntled ex-girlfriend. The CBC fired him. The first woman to testify this week faced a similar cross-examination. She acknowledged Tuesday that she emailed Ghomeshi a photo of herself in a bikini a year after he allegedly sexually assaulted her, pulling her hair and punching her in the head. The woman, whose name is subject to a publication ban, said the photo was \u201cbait\u201d so Ghomeshi would call her and she could demand an explanation for the alleged assault. The trial was adjourned until Monday after the prosecutor said he had to provide a new disclosure to the defense about the third woman complainant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
