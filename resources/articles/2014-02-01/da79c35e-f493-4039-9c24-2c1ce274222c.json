Marcelo did not play in the game but joined a handful of team-mates in a warm-down session around 20 minutes afterwards. At that stage the only supporters left in the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u stadium were around 500 Atl\u00e9tico fans high in the north stand. As Marcelo ran towards them, they launched into monkey chants which were clearly audible in the virtually empty arena. Marcelo stopped immediately below the fans and, motionless, gazed up at them before contuining his exercise. They then chanted: \"Marcelo is a monkey.\" When Marcelo's young son came out and hugged his father soon after, the chant changed to: \"May your father die.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
