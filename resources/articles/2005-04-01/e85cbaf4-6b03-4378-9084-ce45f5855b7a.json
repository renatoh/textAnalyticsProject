Last week, Homestyle revealed its lenders had deferred new financing charges because the company was discussing debt reduction \"initiatives\" with a number of parties. Homestyle has net debts of about \u00a357m, against a market value of \u00a367m. The statement surprised the City as it made no reference of Benson beds, which Homestyle put up for sale several months ago in an effort to raise cash and appease its lenders. Over recent weeks there has been continued speculation that the sale of Bensons, worth anything up to \u00a3150m, had been pulled because Homestyle's other business, the loss-making Rosebys furniture chain, would struggle to survive on its own. If, as market gossips believe, Homestyle opts for a rights issue, analysts reckon it would have to raise at least \u00a340m and the cash call would have to be deeply discounted unless the company could find an investment bank or strategic partner prepared to underwrite the issue. Homestyle shares closed 0.5p lower at 97.5p. In the wider market, leading shares closed lower, unsettled by Friday's profits warning from Ford and poor performances from BP, off 4.5p at 560p, and Shell, down 2.5p at 489p, both of which tracked the crude price lower. The final scores showed the FTSE 100 down 10.4 points at 4,973.2, bringing to a close a four-day winning streak over which the blue chip index gained 77 points. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 index fell 23.2 points to 7,241.9, while the FTSE Small Cap index eased 1.2 points to 2,930.5. In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 100.590, yielding 4.677%. Boots, which rose 19p on Friday, was in demand again. The shares gained 14.5p to 649p, the biggest rise in the FTSE 100, as rumours of predatory interest from the private equity industry refused to die down. Analysts reckoned Boots has in effect launched a leverage buyout by putting its healthcare business and 300 smaller stores up for sale and promising to return a chunk of the proceeds to shareholders. However, analysts at Lehman Brothers said shareholders should question whether this move will realise as much value as full buyout. Gas and electricity supplier Centrica firmed 1.5p to 235p as traders took the view that news of failed merger talks with Norsk Hydro meant the company is looking for a deal and therefore can be considered to be \"in play\". However, anyone banking on a bid for Centrica from either a rival or a private equity group would do well to recall the terms of the company's demerger from BG, down 3.5p at 428.5p. This stipulates that the British Gas brand name would revert to BG if Centrica were subject to a change of ownership. Aggreko, the Glasgow-based temporary power supplier, was among the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250 as investors banked profits. Aggreko shares rose 15% on Friday amid rumours, later denied by the company, that it had received a bid approach. According to Panmure Gordon, which yesterday reiterated its \"sell\" rating on the stock, it is difficult to justify Aggreko's current share price on \"rational valuation measures\". Moreover, it said there are numerous other stocks in the support services sector that are cheaper and have much better growth prospects. The shares fell 8p to 194p. It was a busy day for support services stocks. Davis Service Group gained 7.5p to 451p after the supplier of industrial workplace clothing was identified by Citigroup Smith Barney as a potential takeover target for a private equity group. Elsewhere in the sector, serviced office provider Regus was marked 3.25p higher at 116.75p, the best performance in the FTSE 250, following a presentation by its chief executive, Mark Dixon, at a three-day conference organised by German Bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. After the presentation Dresdner, which is one of Regus's two brokers, issued a research note hinting at earnings upgrades. \"Forecast risk remains on the upside driven by further increases in occupancy/pric ing and the potential to drive out further synergies from HQ Global Workplaces,\" it said. Meanwhile, Rentokil Initial firmed 0.5p to 170.5p after the pest control group said it was pulling out of its presentation to the same conference, scheduled for today. The talk was that the group had pulled out because it had received a takeover approach. But analysts said the reason for Rentokil's no-show was that a director had gone down with flu. Merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander eased 1.25p to 318.75p. However, some market professionals took advantage of the fall to pick up stock. They believe there could be another party interested in making an offer. Singer recently received a takeover approach from its biggest shareholder, Icelandic bank Kaupthing. Rumours of good trading and rising market share helped discount retailer Matalan rise 3.75p to 237.75p. On Aim there was another amazing debut from a shell company focused on the resources sector. Placed at 5p following a \u00a33.1m fund raising, Table Mountain Minerals closed at 11p after heavy trading of 14.7m shares. The company has been formed to work with Black Economic Empowerment groups to exploit mineral rights in South Africa. It boasts Neil McClure, the man who famously sold Swansea City football club for \u00a31 a couple of years back, as chairman. Finally, Innovation Group gained 1p to 51.75p on rumours of contract wins. MMI rallies KBC Peel Hunt said yesterday there was no truth in rumours that the author of a controversial sell note on Aim-listed biotech company Medical Marketing International had been forced to resign. MMI shares have almost halved in value since analyst Gary Waanders published a research report that claimed the company, which has a cancer vaccine in development, was massively overvalued and its shares were worth no more than 40p. However, a spokesman for KBC said Mr Waanders had resigned weeks ago because he was joining another stockbroker that specialises in the drug industry. MMI rallied 17p to 189.5p yesterday as false rumours circulated that Mr Waanders departure was attributable to inaccuracies in the note."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
