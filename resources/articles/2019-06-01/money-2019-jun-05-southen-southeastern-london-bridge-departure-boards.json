The train was displayed on the departure board but the platform remained blank as it often does until the last minute. Five minutes before it was due to leave, the information board said it was expected at 20.08 but still no platform. Then the service disappeared from the departure boards without a platform ever having been displayed or any announcement. After much confusion, staff confirmed it had, in fact, departed on time, leaving us stranded. The next train left after an hour. A Southern customer service operative said that this is a regular occurrence and that departure boards on the lower concourse, staffed by Southeastern, often fail to display the platform for Southern services, while boards upstairs, staffed by Southern, don\u2019t reliably update Southeastern trains. We were advised to wait for Southern trains on the upper level. Since all trains are displayed on all the boards upstairs and down, and platforms are accessible from both, there is no clue that the two levels operate as two different stations. And once you\u2019ve passed through the turnstiles onto the lower concourse (the logical route when arriving from the Tube) there\u2019s no way to access the higher one without invalidating your ticket. ED, Ashurst, Kent Southern has difficulty grasping the problem which has also affected me twice, upstairs and down, at London Bridge. First it told me that platforms may not be advertised until a train is ready for boarding and may be altered at short notice, so passengers should remain on the concourse until it\u2019s been confirmed. Which you \u2013 and I \u2013 did, but the train departed without the platform ever having been announced. Southern continued to miss the point when I pressed. Instead, it said departure details are removed from the lower level boards a minute earlier than upstairs to discourage passengers from running up the escalator to the platform. That still doesn\u2019t explain why the platform was never displayed. It insists Southern staff were wrong and \u201cunhelpful\u201d in claiming this lack or coordination is a regular occurrence and that boards on both levels are synchronised. Although London Bridge looks like one big station, it\u2019s wise to treat it as two and find out which company is operating your train before you decide which level to wait on, as Southeastern staff downstairs can\u2019t \u2013 or won\u2019t \u2013 reliably help with queries about Southern, and vice versa.
