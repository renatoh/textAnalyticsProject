The chimps are still completely out of control and have started throwing food and worse at one another. Would Andrea please come to the diary room? No one could accuse Andrea Leadsom of not learning from her mistakes. When she first ran for the Tory leadership, she made a point of inviting everyone to witness her campaign launch. It featured a \u201cmajor speech on the economy\u201d in which she didn\u2019t once mention the economy and a march on Westminster comprising just her, Tim Loughton and Theresa Villiers. Once seen, never forgotten. That one joint she smoked at university must have had a devastating long-lasting effect on her. This time round, though, Leadsom was taking no chances. Her launch took place in a Westminster broom cupboard to which several journalists, myself included, were refused entrance. The venue was full, we were told. All 15 seats were already reserved. Only that wasn\u2019t quite true. There were still empty chairs by the time Leadsom appeared on stage to talk. To herself, if no one else. What wasn\u2019t so clear was why she imagined she was any better suited to being prime minister now, having crashed and burned so spectacularly first time around. The only possible conclusion was that she reckoned that in the intervening three years the idiot bar had lowered significantly. Leadsom looked up nervously. She wanted people to be the very best they could be. Unlike last time when she had wanted them to be the worst they could be. Nothing escapes Andrea. And she had an absolutely foolproof Brexit plan. She would tell parliament she had a really shit, unworkable plan and that if they did not want to vote for it then she had an equally shit plan for no deal. But not to worry, as there was no chance of her becoming prime minister. \u201cWho am I?\u201d she asked. It was a very good question. But if she didn\u2019t know, there was precious little chance of anyone in the audience being able to help her out. Assuming they actually gave a toss. The BBC certainly didn\u2019t, gleefully curtailing its coverage to go to a story about an escaped hamster. Or something. By the time the Beeb cut back to Leadsom five minutes later, she had all but wrapped up her launch. There was an awkward silence at the end before a couple of admirers led a round of desultory applause. No #Rally4Leadsom glory days this time round. The ever-loyal Loughton trudged back to Westminster alone, quietly sobbing to himself: \u201cWho do we want? Andrea Leadsom.\u201d Where had it all gone wrong? Maybe next time. There would be a next time. Wouldn\u2019t there? Half an hour later, in another room in the same building \u2013 presumably there had been a buy one, get one free offer \u2013 Mark Harper strode purposefully to the front and took off his jacket. As if to say: here is a man who means business. Who would give straight answers to straight questions. The first of which was just who the hell he was. Not even his family always got that one right. \u201cAha,\u201d said Harper. The very fact he was completely unknown \u2013 other than for having had to resign as immigration minister for employing an illegal immigrant \u2013 was what made him just the person to lead the Conservatives and deliver Brexit. He would just wander up to Angela Merkel and say: \u201cHi, I want to do a deal,\u201d and she would reply: \u201cSure. Danke fuck you aren\u2019t Boris or Michael or Jeremy.\u201d And that would be that. A deal would be done sometime in the next six months or so. It was no more incredible than anything anyone else had come up with. No, he hadn\u2019t done any drugs, he added, wistfully. He\u2019d longed to join in with all his colleagues doing lines of coke \u2013 Mikey was a total blast when he was off his head \u2013 and smoking dope. But he\u2019d just never been invited to the right parties. That was why his campaign slogan was \u201cTime for a party where everyone is invited\u201d. It wasn\u2019t long before the only question anyone could think to ask was whether a lion would beat a bear in a fight. Harper deliberated for a few moments. \u201cLion,\u201d he said. Koala bears everywhere cheered wildly. They\u2019d never had it so good. The state of the Tory party. The state of the country. Humiliated by its own government, by its own pretenders. Harper sidled off, never to be seen again. It had been a short and sweet campaign. In its way, a collector\u2019s item. Something rather more hallucinatory was on offer later. Tugging on his opium pipe, Rory Stewart had hired a circus tent on London\u2019s South Bank. To go out with a bang. Or a bong. And what visions Rory the Ringmaster had on offer to a packed house of 600! Here was a possibility of a united Britain. A Xanadu where people came together to settle their Brexit differences through a citizens\u2019 assembly. Where people felt a sense of shame at the state of hospitals, schools and prisons. Where conviction and seriousness walked hand in hand. Where binary politics dissolved into a purple haze of peace and love. It was by far the best speech any Tory candidate had made. One which offered a real sense of leadership. Only it will never catch on, as the party Rory the Ringmaster wants to lead is not the Conservative party. It\u2019s the Lib Dems, or something like them. And in his heart he knows that. Towards the end, when the visions were less intense, reality began to seep in. He admitted that his middle ground was a lost cause in a contest where Boris Johnson was favourite. The Ringmaster was no match for the elephant. Whether in the room or out. He even said he would back a Labour bill to take no deal and prorogation off the table. And with that the dream really did die. It was a matter of when, not if, his campaign turned to ash. The Electric Fool-Aid Acid Test would have to carry on without him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
