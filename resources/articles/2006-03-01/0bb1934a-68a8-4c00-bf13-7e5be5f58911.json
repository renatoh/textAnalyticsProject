Basically I wanted to find out whether my theory - that PSP's are more prevalent in the wild than DS's - stood up. It did. The scores were: DS 33 PSP 51 Others (GBA, Gizmondo etc) 7 Of course, this small survey doesn't really prove anything - other than how good you lot are at sizing up fellow travellers - but it does hint at the importance of product design. Style and branding makes the PSP appeal more to an older audience - no commuting embarrassment here - even if the quality of games can't match those of the DS. It'll be interesting to see if these figures change when Lite and Brain Training arrive - I'm guessing they will."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
