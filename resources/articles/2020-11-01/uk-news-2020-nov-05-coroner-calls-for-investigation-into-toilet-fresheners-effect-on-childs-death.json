Arietta-Grace Barnett was taken to hospital after possibly ingesting the Toilet Duck capsule and vomiting a \u201cbright pink\u201d liquid. She was initially judged well enough to leave hospital but was rushed back to Southampton general hospital when she began vomiting blood and died in July last year. After a two-day inquest in Winchester, Hampshire, the coroner Rosamund Rhodes-Kemp said Arietta-Grace was believed to have swallowed a Toilet Duck gel capsule designed to stick to the toilet bowl and slowly release its chemicals. But Rhodes-Kemp said it had not been proven that the corrosion of the girl\u2019s oesophagus was caused by the product. Recording a verdict of accidental death, she said further investigation was needed. \u201cThe difficulty we have here is a connection between that product and what happened, and it seems to me that needs further investigation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is designed to stick to a wet surface and not to be flushed through by water. If it does contain agents that can cause this sort of corrosion and this sort of death in a child then it\u2019s very important the manufacturer is aware of that, can investigate themselves, and steps can be taken to prevent this tragedy occurring again.\u201d She added: \u201cToilet bowls are readily accessible to small children and these products are designed to be bright, pretty colours and attractive in smell, particularly to children.\u201d A paediatric surgeon, Simon Keys, told the hearing it was not certain that a chemical from the product had caused the injury and added: \u201cIf this is the explanation for the injury, it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s been described. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy clearly, it has wide implications for everybody in the medical community treating people with this type of injury and for the people making these products.\u201d Arietta-Grace\u2019s mother, Lucy Cook, from Sarisbury Green, Hampshire, described her daughter\u2019s last moments. She said a doctor told her they had done all they could. \u201cI saw Arietta and there was more blood coming out, I was told it was her last breath,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone gave me Arietta wrapped up in blankets. I noticed Arietta had her brown bow in her hair and she must have put this in herself.\u201d Earlier, Dr Nicola Trevelyan, a consultant paediatrician at Southampton general hospital, said it was not known why the girl\u2019s vomit was pink; the capsule was blue-green. She said no one had seen Arietta-Grace swallow the capsule, but added: \u201cThat seemed to be the most logical thing she might have taken. My experience as a paediatrician is that products that look like sweets will attract children to play with them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
