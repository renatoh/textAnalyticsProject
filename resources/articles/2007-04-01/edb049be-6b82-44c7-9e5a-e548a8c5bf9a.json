The images, picked up immediately by the world's media, have since become scorched on our consciousness: naked Iraqi prisoners stacked in a human pyramid, presided over by grinning US soldiers; a female soldier leading a naked Iraqi around by a leash; other Iraqis forced to simulate fellatio; a hooded inmate balanced on a cardboard box, electric wires attached to his fingers. One of the stunned Americans watching 60 Minutes II back in 2004 was eminent psychologist Professor Philip Zimbardo, in Washington that night on business. Zimbardo, more than anyone else in the country, had been there before. In 1971, as a young psychologist at California's Stanford University, he had conducted an experiment into the psychology of imprisonment, dividing a group of undergraduate students into 'guards' and 'prisoners'. That August, Zimbardo witnessed levels of cruelty he'd never have predicted or imagined. Within no time, liberal undergraduates became sadists, tormenting prisoners, even forcing them, in an uncanny premonition of George W Bush's Iraq 33 years later, to simulate sodomy with one another. After six days, Zimbardo called a halt to the experiment. Although the 'guards' knew the 'prisoners had done nothing criminally wrong to deserve their lowly status', he writes in his new book, 'some ... were transformed into perpetrators of evil'. The experiment taught him that 'most of us can undergo significant character transformations when we are caught up in the crucible of social forces'. It is to answer the question of 'how good people turn evil' that Zimbardo has written The Lucifer Effect, a formidable piece of research into the nature of evil and the systems and situations that foster it. Zimbardo, who grew up in poverty in the South Bronx and, as a child, witnessed how a harsh environment can breed cruelty and abuse, has come to some chilling conclusions. Far from the Abu Ghraib atrocities being the work of a handful of bad apples, or 'rogue soldiers', as General Richard B Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put it, Zimbardo argues that they were the result of an entire 'bad barrel', going right to the top. Zimbardo begins his book with a painful but necessary examination of some of the 20th century's worst examples of man's inhumanity to man: the butchery of up to 350,000 Chinese civilians at the hands of the Japanese at Nanking in 1937; the 'banality of evil' as personified by Adolf Eichmann; the massacre of some 800,000 Rwandans in the 1994 genocide. Morality, he observes, is like 'a gearshift that at times gets pushed into neutral'. The story of Abu Ghraib, the focus of the book, is told with precision, in detail, and with no little narrative skill. The prison had previously been where Saddam Hussein had arranged for the torture and murder of 'dissidents' in twice-weekly public executions. When the Americans occupied it after their overthrow of the Iraqi regime in March 2003, and began to fill it with Iraqi prisoners, it remained a hellish place. It was attacked as many as 20 times a week by mortar shelling. Fear pervaded both prisoners and the US soldiers whose sorry job it was to guard them. The officer in charge of the prison, Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, the only female commander in the war zone, who had no experience of running any kind of prison, never visited the special interrogation centre where the abuses were carried out. It was, she later said, a 'special site', and so not under her supervision. After the publication of the photographs, seven guards were charged with 'maltreating detainees', among them Ivan 'Chip' Frederick, at whose trial Zimbardo appeared as an expert witness. Frederick, then 37, the son of a West Virginia coal miner, was an archetypal ordinary American Joe: God-fearing, basketball-playing, a disciplined soldier, super-patriotic. At Abu Ghraib, though, he became ground down and dehumanised. He worked 12-hour shifts, from 4pm to 4am, seven days a week, 40 days without rest, and slept in a prison cell when off duty. In his words: 'Shit was backed up in the porta-potties. There was trash and mould everywhere ... there were human body parts in the facility ... there was a pack of wild dogs running around.' Prisoners regularly attacked guards; on one occasion, a gun was smuggled in and a shoot-out with guards followed. Such an environment, Zimbardo writes, 'was as extreme a setting for creating deindividuation as I can imagine'. Cruelty became sexualised: one guard sodomised a male prisoner with a chemical light; another raped a female detainee. Bush, grandstanding in typical fashion after the event, vowed that the 'wrongdoers will be brought to justice'. But, to date, only the lowly guards have ever been tried, with Frederick, who pleaded guilty, being given eight years. Human Rights Watch, in a 2005 report, blamed former US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and the heads of the CIA and the US army, for 'decisions and ... policies that facilitated serious and widespread violations of the law'. Zimbardo agrees: 'The seeds for the flowers of evil that blossomed in that dark dungeon of Abu Ghraib were planted by the Bush administration in its triangular framing of national security threats, citizen fear and vulnerability, and interrogation/torture to win the war on terror.' But, Zimbardo argues, there is no cause for complacency: all of us, given the right circumstances, are capable of monstrous acts. As Solzhenitsyn writes in The Gulag Archipelago: 'The line between good and evil is in the centre of every human heart.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
