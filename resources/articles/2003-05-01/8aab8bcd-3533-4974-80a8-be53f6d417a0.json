Mr Wilson, who has been at the lecturers' union for five years, is set to become head of organisation and services at the TUC in July. He told EducationGuardian.co.uk: \"I have very much enjoyed working at Natfhe, it's a union to be proud of. And I'm not going very far. I will work closely with all the education unions, including Natfhe.\" The move was announced at Natfhe's annual conference in Blackpool. Mr Wilson, formerly with the Association of University Teachers and once mooted as a possible candidate for AUT general secretary, has pioneered closer working relationships between the two unions, which culminated in a joint pay claim this year. Both unions also passed motions at their summer conferences to develop this relationship further. Paul Mackney general secretary of Natfhe, said the relationship between the AUT and Natfhe had never been better. \"Any differences of principle or even strategy have evaporated. The joint work is going so well we need to start thinking beyond that. We have a joint statement agreeing to try to do as much as we can together.\" The unions have united in their opposition to the government's plans to reform higher education, voicing their \"total opposition\" to top-up fees and calling for the abolition of existing upfront fees from September. Mr Wilson said he had \"100% condemnation\" for just about everything the white paper. Perhaps more controversially, Natfhe has agreed a motion that means the union will back any lecturer who refuses to teach an \"active fascist\". Mr Mackney said this had been a problem for lecturers in Burnley where British National Party members sit on the local council. Mr Wilson said members were not calling for powers to \"pick and chose\" who they taught, but universities had to recognise that active members of the BNP on campuses could contravene the Race Relations Act, which makes all public bodies responsible for promoting racial equality within their organisations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
