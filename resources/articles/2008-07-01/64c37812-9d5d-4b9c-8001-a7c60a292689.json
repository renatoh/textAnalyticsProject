By this time her mother was in hospital, dying of Parkinson's, but she managed to tell her daughter, who was visiting, that she loved her and thought she was beautiful. Murray cried all the way home. That was in 2006, altogether an appalling year for Murray, in which both her mother and father died and she herself was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy. This is a memoir of that grim year and Murray's life, but it is her relationship with her mother, Win Bailey, that has dominated her life and this book. Murray describes her mother, on page one, as \"difficult, argumentative [and] demanding\", and later as jealous, repressive, phenomenally strict and relentlessly critical. Win's treatment of her daughter seems shockingly harsh nowadays, when positive reinforcement and declarations of love are an accepted must for any halfway decent parent. But in her mother's defence, Murray describes Win as a woman of her time - a time when mothers stayed at home, \"keepers of house, children and family respectability\", fathers went to work, daughters did as they were told and ruthless criticism was fairly normal. Unfortunately for baby Murray, Dr Spock had not reached Barnsley in 1950 and her parents stuck to Truby King, whose rigid child-rearing strictures probably rather suited her mother's regime. Even so, this mother seems to have been on the tougher side of normal, although Murray describes \"happy and contented times\" spent with her as a child, particularly around cooking and food, and remembers feeling \"adored\" at table. Win had an early and tougher version of the naughty step - a smack followed by up to two hours on the bottom stair, for such misdemeanours as having a \"filthy mouth\" and saying \"bloody\". Tensions increased as Murray grew older, the criticism becoming increasingly painful: \"cheap little tart\"; \"Ten Ton Tessie\"; \"such a pity you seem to take after your dad and not me when it comes to bone structure\"; \"all you can ever think about is yourself and showing off about the bloody BBC\". Murray's father, whom she clearly adored and who often acted as a mediator between mother and daughter, was absent for much of her adolescence. He was offered work in India when she was 11, and when her mother decided that they should join him, Murray refused to go with her, choosing to go to school in Britain, rather than boarding school abroad, and to live with her maternal grandparents. But life with her grandparents brought another distressing problem. Grandma suffered from serious bouts of depression, and would suddenly run off to the nearby railway line or canal to try to end it all. Murray repeatedly had to run after her and bring her home. Meanwhile, Win divided her time between her daughter and husband, all through Murray's teens. But the horror of her mother's first departure at the airport took her by surprise. Both mother and daughter were distraught. Murray felt abandoned and realised that she did \"love [her] mother passionately\"; the parting was so painful for them both that Murray determined from then on to \"shut down any emotion that might prove painful\". This determination seems to be reflected in her writing. Almost in hope of respite from the intense pain of watching and dealing with her mother's final illness, her father's ensuing loneliness and death, and her own cancer, she sometimes turns away from the personal and takes on the voice of a radio journalist, feminist and campaigner: for more humane treatment of women during childbirth, for equality at work, women's rights, against men's \"ownership\" of women, and to bring \"women's health out of the dark ages\". But it is her fearless examination of her \"love-hate\" relationship with her mother, the confused feelings of betrayal that go with success, and the family dynamics and tensions that are most fascinating. \"Two women and one spectacular man - bound to end in tears!\" She is also fiercely critical of herself: a \"wayward, headstrong, self-obsessed daughter\", who \"never showed [my mother] any gratitude or sympathy, taking every cruel opportunity to expose her arrested intellectual development ... I was an insufferable intellectual snob and a liar ... always needing to attract attention and be reassured how wonderful I am\". Murray looks back on all this \"with guilty regret\", and admits to being ashamed and disgusted with herself for finding the protracted care of her parents \"such an awful burden\". I suspect that she was far more dutiful than most. Verging on heroic, in fact it will be of great comfort to the increasing numbers of us now struggling with infirm, ageing parents, illness, death and regrets, that even someone as successful as Jenni Murray can never quite feel that she has done enough. \u00b7 Michele Hanson is the author of Living with Mother: Right to the Very End (Virago)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
