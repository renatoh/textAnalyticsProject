The Edinburgh court has directed that the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise should be paid before ordinary creditors in the proposal that is being prepared by the administrators and directors of the Fir Park club. Motherwell are understandably keen to avoid the 10-point penalty the Scottish Premier League will impose for clubs in administration on May 31. A club spokesman said: \"This decision will not delay Motherwell emerging from interim administration. That will happen before the end of the season. \"We had to wait until we received the decision from the Court of Session on the status of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise before we could put a proposal to creditors. \"But the administrator and directors are now exploring every way to maximise the dividend to creditors as a matter of urgency.\" The property developer Robert McGrail has admitted that his hopes of buying Tynecastle are fading fast. McGrail, who has a 10% shareholding in Hearts, had been hoping to buy the stadium and lease it back to the club to stave off the proposed move to Murrayfield. However, he has conceded that his proposal looks to have floundered after discussions with the club. McGrail said: \"To be honest, I am losing hope that anything will come of my proposal. The theory behind my idea, which is a simple strategy as far as I am concerned, is that it would give Hearts time to sort out a solution to their current situation. \"However, all the indications which I have had is that the board is intent on moving to Murrayfield this summer. \"I am disappointed in the sense that I believe my pro posal is a very real option but they haven't even given me a figure which they are looking for.\" Partick Thistle have handed their former defender Daniele Chiarini the chance to prove himself again at Firhill after re-signing Kenny Milne on a new two-year deal. The former Aberdeen and Manchester United midfielder Ben Thornley is also training with the Jags in an attempt to earn a contract with the club. But it is the possible return of the defender Chiarini that will surprise Partick fans. The Italian controversially chose to move to Dundee United in January last year despite an offer from the then Thistle manager John Lambie after he impressed on a short-term deal at Firhill. However, Partick's joint-manager Gerry Britton revealed that the club are considering offering Chiarini an opportunity. Britton said: \"We all know what Daniele is capable of and we will have a look at him in training over the course of the next 48 hours. If he does well and a deal can be struck, then we will be delighted to add him to our pool for the rest of the season. \"We will take a look at both Ben and Daniele in training and, if both show up well, then it may give us a chance to supplement the squad prior to the deadline.\" Milne, meanwhile, is happy to have secured a new deal with the club despite their position, 10 points adrift at the foot of the Premier League table. He said: \"I am delighted to stay here at Thistle, especially with the new management in place, and with them being here for next season as well I think they can only bring the club forward. \"Despite things not going too well at the moment, there is no feeling of gloom and despondency as all the players still believe that we have the ability to get out of our current situation this season, although we admit that, as each game goes by, then the chances become slightly less.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
