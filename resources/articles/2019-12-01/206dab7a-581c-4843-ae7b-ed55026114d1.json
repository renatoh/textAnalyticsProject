What if they'd spent it on housing?", "bodyText": "The two billionaire candidates in the Democratic presidential race together spent roughly $15m on television ads in California leading up to Thursday\u2019s debate. If that money were spent on homeless people suffering from the state\u2019s severe and worsening housing crisis, advocates say, it could help thousands in need find a roof over their heads. Ahead of the sixth Democratic primary debate in Los Angeles on Thursday, the billionaires at the bottom of the polls, Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, poured $13.5m and $1.6m respectively into TV ads in the state, according to Advertising Analytics, which monitors political ads. The ad buys renewed criticism of both the vast amounts spent in the presidential race and independently wealthy candidates\u2019 relying on their own fortunes to fund key aspects of their campaigns. The Guardian asked housing researchers and experts what difference $15m could make in one of California\u2019s most pressing crises \u2013 homelessness. Thursday\u2019s debate brought a national audience to a county with extreme income inequality, home to some of the world\u2019s wealthiest people as well as an estimated 59,000 homeless residents \u2013 many on the streets for the first time due to evictions and unaffordable rents. The experts agreed it would be less than drop in the bucket given the scale of the public health emergency, but said it could still provide life-changing help for a sizable number of families in the most dire situations. In Los Angeles for example, $15m could provide new shelter for roughly 1,800 homeless people, estimated the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, the area home to massive tent encampments in downtown LA. His organization was recently able to open a sprung structure shelter in a parking lot that can house 120 women at a cost of roughly $1m. There is growing interest in expanding that model in the region, he said, calculating that $15m could provide immediate shelter for 1,800 people. The goal of these shelters is to transition people into permanent housing, give them access to case managers, housing services, medical and mental healthcare, three meals a day, and beds and a roof over their heads. \u201cThey stay as long as it takes to get on their feet and into housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat campaign money might go further if it was used to address the real situation, rather than spent on TV ads.\u201d With more than 44,000 homeless people estimated to be living outside in LA county in cars, tents or makeshift quarters, the need for more beds and protected shelter space is dire. More than 1,000 homeless people died in the county last year. Some advocates, however, have urged governments to prioritize permanent housing instead of the expansion of emergency shelters, which can sometimes offer poor conditions. In LA, $15m could also fund a total of roughly 30 new individual units of supportive housing for homeless people, estimated Gary Painter, director of the Homelessness Policy Research Institute at the University of Southern California. With families, those units could potentially offer housing for about 50 people. Even if that number seemed small, Painter noted that access to supportive housing can change the trajectory for families for years, potentially saving future generations from instability and homelessness: \u201cOne could imagine that investment on vulnerable families paying off in the long term.\u201d Bales estimated that $15m could also provide supportive community homes for roughly 100 homeless people suffering from mental illness in LA. One-off philanthropic donations won\u2019t resolve homelessness in California, which is a chronic and systemic problem, and advocates caution that the government has a responsibility to tackle the structural issues that drive the crisis. \u201cWe\u2019re not a poor state that can\u2019t afford to solve this problem,\u201d said Eve Garrow, homelessness policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, noting that the state has the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and needs to focus on permanent, affordable housing. Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, noted that California has already poured billions into homelessness and that it\u2019s not nearly enough, given that for every 10 of the lowest-income renters in the state, there are fewer than two affordable homes available: \u201cIt\u2019s really the role of the federal government to step in and invest in the scale of solutions that are needed.\u201d But thinking through the potential impacts if this ad funding was spent on direct actions can be a helpful reminder of how the massive amounts of money flowing into America\u2019s political system. Steyer, a California billionaire who has poured his own money into advocating impeachment of Trump, fighting the climate crisis, voter registration initiatives and other issues, has argued that the money he is spending on his campaign is not taking away from his support of progressive causes. Bloomberg entered the race last month and didn\u2019t qualify for the debate this month, but has spent $117m on ads across the country, recently flooding the LA market. In the past 90 days, Steyer\u2019s campaign also spent more on Facebook ads targeted to California, according to Anna Massoglia, a researcher with the Center for Responsive Politics. He spent more than $1.2m on Facebook in the state, while Bloomberg spent more than $650,000. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign spent $250,000 on Facebook during this period. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary and a 2020 candidate who did not qualify for the LA debate, did spotlight the homelessness crisis this week with a visit to Skid Row. Asked about the money his rivals have spent on ads, he told the Guardian: \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in this election cycle is that too often times in politics, money still talks. People can basically buy their way on to the debate stage. They can buy increases in polling very quickly when you dump $100m on TV ads. We need to get to a time in this country where money doesn\u2019t talk the same way that it does today.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
