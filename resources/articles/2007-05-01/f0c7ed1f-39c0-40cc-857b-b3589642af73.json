The Apple email", "bodyText": "The power of internet gossip makes Chinese whispers seem tame. Last week a prank email wiped \u00a31.4bn off Apple's share price after spreading rumours about the company's eagerly awaited sequel to the iPod music player, the iPhone. Shortly before 10am last Wednesday, a hoax email, posing as an internal news alert, was sent to Apple staff claiming that the iPhone's US launch was being delayed by a few months, along with that of Leopard, the next version of the Apple Mac operating system. At 11.47am, Apple sent a real email to employees, explaining that the first message was bogus, but it was too late. The 'announcement' was on the blogosphere, and at 11.49am news of the alleged delays appeared on Engadget, a technology blog owned by AOL, which felt confident in the source of the information. A trading frenzy of Apple stock broke out on Wall Street, and the company's market value plunged 3 per cent, \u00a31.4bn, in six minutes. By the end of the day, though, the stock had largely recovered. Sighs of relief all round."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
