I also hold Vanessa Redgrave and James Earl Jones in high regard and thought their performances in Driving Miss Daisy were magical. But casting them as Beatrice and Benedick is another matter and results, in Mark Rylance's hands, in one of the most senseless Shakespearean productions I have seen in a long time. In some Shakespeare plays, such as The Tempest, age is almost irrelevant. But Much Ado, which largely concerns the gulling of two dedicated singletons into marriage, is one of Shakespeare's most socially realistic comedies. Over the years I've seen it set perfectly plausibly during the unification of Italy, the revolution in Mexico and the Raj in India. But Rylance's idea of showing a group of American troops billeted in rural England in 1944 does nothing to explain the casting. You can't help wondering why Earl Jones's Benedick is a boon companion to the youthful Claudio or why Redgrave's Beatrice, however youthful in spirit, appears to be older than her uncle. But what is hard to credit is the general incompetence of the staging. As an example one has only to take the deception of Benedick into the belief that Beatrice loves him: a scene that I have known reduce audiences to helpless laughter. I should have thought a minimum requirement was that Benedick should be physically present when Don Pedro casts the verbal bait so we can see his facial reaction: here, incredibly, Benedick is off stage. The subsequent speech when Benedick reasons himself into marriage climaxes in what I always thought was the infallibly funny line, \"No, the world must be peopled.\" Delivered, as it is here, by the well-seasoned Earl Jones it falls flat as a pancake. Redgrave has similar problems in persuading us that Beatrice is a woman who, possibly on the cusp of middle age, inveighs against matrimony because she subconsciously seeks it. Being the great actor she is, Redgrave has odd moments of unpredictable magic: when, as Beatrice, she reveals that at her birth \"a star danced\" she gestures heavenwards as if communing with the cosmos. But much of her performance runs against the grain of the text: it is characteristic of the evening's misdirected oddity that when we are told how Beatrice, \"like a lapwing, runs close by the ground, to hear our conference\" she rushes across the stage bolt upright. I am not being over-literal. It is Rylance who has chosen to set the action in the England of 1944 and to highlight the contrast between the predominantly African-American visiting servicemen and a white rural population with its village bobbies, boy scouts and Salvation Army majors. And because the action has a local habitation, it is legitimate to ask exactly who Benedick and Beatrice are and how they fit into the general picture. If the production periodically lapses into coherence, it is largely through a handful of stalwart supporting players. Danny Lee Wynter's Don John has an obdurate villainy, Michael Elwyn hints at Leonato's Lear-like rage at his daughter's supposed treachery, Peter Wight, doubling as Dogberry and Friar Francis, delivers the latter's calming words with dignity. Claire van Kampen's music also periodically lifts one's sinking spirits with its evocations of Forties jive and bebop. But the set \u2013 by designer Ultz \u2013 consisting largely of an inset brown box, cramps the action physically and provides little to delight the eye. The ultimate impression is of a weird evening in which two great actors are left struggling to find their characters, and sometimes even their lines, and in which the great and noble cause of age-blind casting suffers a decisive setback."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
