Morris was arrested for a second time earlier this week following allegations of a second serious sexual assault. West Yorkshire police confirmed the alleged incident happened some time ago, but only recently came to light during an on-going investigation into a separate matter. Earlier this month Morris was bailed by police investigating an allegation that a 20-year-old woman was sexually assaulted. As a result, the club suspended Morris pending the investigation. That suspension came to an end yesterday - at which point a further meeting was held, resulting in today's outcome. \"Jody Morris has agreed to take a 10-day leave of absence,\" a Leeds statement said. \"It is emphasised that this agreement should not be interpreted as any admission of wrongdoing by the player.\" Leeds manager Peter Reid said he is \"being kept informed\" of proceedings and that he and Morris will answer all questions at an appropriate time. \"At the minute it's all best kept in-house. When I've got something to say, then I will talk about it and explain everything,\" he said. \"Some things are best kept private between me and the player and at the right time I'll make a comment. Hopefully I'll have Jody sat next to me when I do it. We won't duck it, but I think the boy and the manager need a say. The right time to do that is when we are together and I promise we will do it.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * PASS THE DUTCHIE? The scene: Barcelona's swanky training ground yesterday. Shooting practice has just finished and Patrick Kluivert - who was, apparently, more wayward than a teenage Drew Barrymore - is heading back to the Nou Camp. \"Patrick, Patrick,\" barks one press pack hound. \"How close are you to joining Arsenal?\" Without breaking stride, Kluivert replies: \"Not close at all. I won't be going in the near future.\" The reporter persists. \"So what were you doing in England?\" he asks. \"I was there to do the stuff on Sky, that's all,\" Kluivert drawls, before diving into the Nou Camp changing rooms. End of story? Not quite. Because when the Fiver purchased tonight's Lahn's Lahn Eve'ing Stannahhr! Get Your Stannahhr Here. 40p! Just 40p! today, a different tale emerged - namely that the over-rated striker secretly believes \"Arsenal are close to agreeing a loan deal to take him to Highbury in January!\" So what gives? Well, according to the paper, Kluivert's agent Siggi Lenz is negotiating a deal worth a whopping \u00a360,000-a-week (Not bad at all - for the Dutchman at least. Arsenal fans might be less happy seeing as he hasn't scored all season). Meanwhile, Patrick Vieira was today ruled out until mid-November. \"Patrick has had a setback in the game in Kiev and will be out again for a few weeks,\" Arsene Wenger told the club's official website www.bottleitineurope.com. \"We don't know what is exactly happening with his muscle - but he is not right.\" A bit like the move for Kluivert, perhaps? * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It is all ifs and buts and you never know in football what might happen, but, no, I haven't said I've retired from international football because I just haven't\" - Sometimes though, Teddy Sheringham, it goes without saying. * * * * * * * * * * * * 18 CERTIFICATE Now that he has turned 18, Wayne Rooney can buy bongo and Blue Nun. (Welcome to the Fiver's world!) Now that he has turned 18, Wayne Rooney can also apparently speak. To prove it, Wayne said some words today. Unfortunately for us, most of them were said while on the phone to a celebrity magazine who want to take the pictures at his low-key 18th birthday celebration - and pay \"tens of thousands\" for the privilege. But under the frowning watch of his boss David Moyes, the 18-year-old also opened his (birthday) cake-hole to the media. \"The boss is great-la',\" yelped Wayne, 18, as if suddenly kicked by the seething Scotsman standing next to him. \"He tells me when I'm doing things right and when I'm doing things wrong, which is just what I need.\" What the man really needs a pair of lead boots to help keep his feet on the ground. Fortunately, Moyes had gift-wrapped a particularly heavy pair to go with his birthday greetings telling him how out of form he is. \"It has been a really big climb for Wayne in a short period of time - and it is so important that you don't lose your roots, values or sight of the reason why you got there,\" said Moyes, while shredding Wayne's brochure of diamond-encrusted Lacoste shellies-la'. \"He is doing well as a footballer - but in the future we hope to see him doing even better.\" Sod that, let's party! \"It is impossible to do what any ordinary 18-year-old lad would do, and that is to go around town and in the pubs or go to the local social club and have family and friends there,\" explained Rooney's agent Paul Stretford as if about to launch into some gossamer-thin excuse for why he has booked Atomic Kitten and Blue for the lad's do. Which, funnily enough, he has. \"There is an exclusive buy-up by a celebrity magazine and all that money will go to the hospital. Let's not hide on this, these things go on but he is not putting that money into his own pocket. He has a social awareness, he believes he can help others.\" Still doesn't explain away Atomic Kitten though, does it? * * * * * * * * * * * * WIN! WIN! WIN!

One high-profile howler and Chelsea are prepared to trade Carlo Cudicini [and \u00a36m] for Parma's Sebastian Frey. \"The idea of me going to England agrees with me,\" chirped Frey. And Carlton Palmer wants a quick return to management with Cheltenham Town, though the feeling may not be entirely mutual. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Steed Malbranque has signed a one-year extension to his contract with Fulham and should now stay at the club until 2007. \"I think we will be able to bring some success here,\" he said, though more to himself than anyone else. Despite their strongest start to a season for 10 years, Mr Fergie has warned that Manchester United will not be at their best until after Christmas. \"What we have done is we have been consistent,\" he crowed. \"We hope to maintain that consistency up to New Year and we always feel we improve in the second half.\" But if United are to retain the Premiership crown, they'll have to do it without - gulp - their chief of PR, Paddy Harverson, who's set to leave to become the Prince of Wales' new communications secretary. Yes, it's been another slow news day. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: World Football (3.15am) \"I once worked in Kwik Save,\" writes James Walmesley, which can only mean it's the final day of Bad Jobs.
