It has been a common sight this season, Chelsea getting bogged down at home after failing to build on fast starts, and Lampard needs his players to discover the clinical edge they have shown on the road when they host Lille. \u201cWe wanted more in our home games and quite a lot of it has been chance conversion,\u201d said the Chelsea manager. \u201cAway from home we\u2019ve gone and racked up some goals and some really good performances, and scored early in the game. But when you play well at home but don\u2019t score for 45 minutes you kind of add the pressure on yourselves. We need to take our chances, especially ones that come early in a game. If you\u2019ve got pressure, you need to convert it.\u201d Yet while it could be another tense occasion in front of their supporters, Chelsea would have taken this situation after opening their European campaign with a home defeat by Valencia. Lille are out after picking up one point from five games in Group H and a Chelsea win will leave Ajax and Valencia fighting over the other qualification spot in Amsterdam. A draw would leave them relying on the Dutch side beating their Spanish counterparts. Not that Lampard will take anything for granted after the 4-4 draw with nine-man Ajax last month and the wild 2-2 with Valencia a fortnight ago. Chelsea, who have not won at home in the Champions League since September 2017, have lost three of their last four games in the Premier League and have to react after Saturday\u2019s 3-1 defeat by Everton. It is an occasion that calls for composure and Lampard, who is likely to stiffen his back four by starting Antonio R\u00fcdiger for the first time since 14 September, will find out if his players are capable of expressing themselves when the stakes are this high. \u201cI think you can be defined as an individual and as a group by success and what success looks like,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this means going into the next stage of the Champions League. I used to love big nights as a player. It\u2019s opportunities now for the team, particularly the young players, to make a mark. I like the pressure of this game being a knockout. If we\u2019re going to do anything good here, then we are going to need lots of these nights.\u201d While a lack of ruthlessness in attack explains why Chelsea are monitoring Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Jadon Sancho, Wilfried Zaha, Timo Werner and Fyodor Chalov, there are issues in defence as well. Lampard was furious after the Everton game and admitted his players failed to show enough personality in the individual duels. Kurt Zouma and Andreas Christensen were awful in central defence and Lampard, whose side have kept one clean sheet in their last nine games, is worried about the form of his goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga. Zouma said a lack of communication has been a problem and it is a mark of his side\u2019s vulnerability that Lampard, who could pursue a \u00a340m move for the Bournemouth defender Nathan Ak\u00e9 in January after Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban was halved last week, could replace Christensen with R\u00fcdiger against Lille. The German is Chelsea\u2019s best defender but he has played only 45 minutes this season due to injuries. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially difficult but our guard against that was to give him a lot of work,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to create some things behind the scenes here in training that look like match play \u2013 and some pure running as well. He\u2019s come through that. You only speak as you look at him and he looks fit and ready to go and I know he\u2019s hungry.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
