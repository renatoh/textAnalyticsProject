Since then it has ridden the wave of growth in iMac add-ons, then the iPod and more recently the iPhone and iPad. The challenge though is to try to figure out what Apple is going to do next - especially because they don't get any special inkling from Apple about what's going to happen next despite their longstanding support. Jackie Ballinger of Griffin told us about the challenge now that there are hundreds of companies pumping out me-too accessories - plus how the company (which still gets a majority of its revenue from Apple products) is seeing growing demand for Android and RIM add-ons. And she reveals which of the Android tablets has been doing best, and which of the phones."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
