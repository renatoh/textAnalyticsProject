This blog has has grown into a very special Strictly community over the years, and it makes writing every week an absolute pleasure. I genuinely can\u2019t thank you enough. My liveblogging duties might be over for the year, but there will be a thread on Christmas Day for the Strictly Christmas Special, so you can all chat in the comment box. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so do come and say hello. Have a wonderful Christmas and a happy 2018 \u2013 see you next September and we\u2019ll do it all again. Keeeeeep dancing! Hx And the winner is\u2026JOE AND KATYA! WELL. Didn\u2019t think that would actually happen in the end \u2013 I thought their showdance might have blown it. Huge congratulations to all of them, incredibly worthy finalists, and a massive well done to Joe and Katya. WHAT A FINAL! Oh thank GOODNESS. It\u2019s time to announce the winner! I have no idea who this will be, but my gut says Debbie. OK I\u2019m totally montaged out now. Crown a winner, I\u2019m done. Anyone for another montage? I feel like we haven\u2019t had quite enough. Hooray, a trailer for the Christmas Special! I won\u2019t be liveblogging, but I\u2019ll open a comment thread for you. Time to bring back the stars of Strictly for a final group dance! Feels like several decades have passed since Chizzy was on the show. Likewise Reverend Richard, they were both fabulous. Brian falls off a wall, and Charlotte is still joyously wooden. Simon doesn\u2019t do anything either, but YES Aston is back. ANTON DRINK. Jonnie\u2019s had a haircut and Aston pops in a backflip, as a reminder of the showdance we missed (I\u2019ll never get over this). Susan and Kevin throw in a bit of Morecambe and Wise, and Davood does his bum lift. I really wanted Mollie and AJ to snog at the end. Why do they keep disappointing me? I feel like this final has been going for several years. I\u2019m now older than Debbie, and parts of Bruno. Time for another montage! If you\u2019re still standing, DRINK. Is it time to crown a winner yet? How is there 20 minutes left? Voting has closed! How is there no-one dancing to this? Do we have to look at Ed Sheeran? Why would anyone want to do that? Oh thank goodness. Karen and Pasha are here to save us. But not Kevin, because there are Alleged Domestic Issues chez Clifton. Goodness, that montage went on for weeks. IT\u2019S TIME FOR ED SHEERAN, singing this year\u2019s entry for this \u201cfirst dance at a wedding\u201d award. DRIIIIIINK. OK, I\u2019m quite tired now. 25 minutes to go, STAY WITH ME. Time for another montage! DRINK! I\u2019ve loved this series, it\u2019s been great fun and you guys have been a weekend refuge in a stressful year. Thank you. Time for a recap! DRINK! We scored a full house on bingo hours ago. So the irrelevant leaderboard is as follows: Alexandra, Joe, Debbie and Gemma. I predict that Debbie will win, for having the best partnership, doing a banging Argentine, and waving the flag for women of a certain age. But I\u2019m really not sure, the glitterball could genuinely be taken by any of them. How amazing is that? Chizzy is crying. DRINK! Darcey loved it - the perfect end to a great final. Shirley thinks Joe has turned into a magnificent dancer. Bruno thought all the couples have been incredible, but isn\u2019t specific about Joe. Craig thought it was fab.u.lous. I feel like I\u2019m being mean now. I do think Joe is great, but that Charleston just wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. Incidentally, tens all round. Nope, still don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s full of character and fun, but Joe\u2019s swivel is a bit laboured and it just all feels a bit clunky. Not even the performance can save it, I have no idea why they chose this. Oh hang on, the judges loved it. That\u2019s why. And finally for this year, it\u2019s Joe and Katya! They\u2019re dancing their Week 7 Charleston to \u2018Alexander\u2019s Ragtime Band\u2019 by Ella Fitzgerald. I didn\u2019t like this at all first time round \u2013 annoying, a bit wooden, and Joe\u2019s swivel was a bit ropey. But the judges loved it, so what do I know? Maybe it will have improved over time, like a fine cheese. Scores: 9,10,10,10. Not sure a ten from Shirley means anything at all when everyone gets one. Mention of Ed Sheeran! DRINK! Craig thought it was quiet, understated and classy, unlike Bruno, who has has fallen of his chair. Darcey thought they brought all the magic of Blackpool. Shirley thought it was a musical extravaganza, and Gemma has turned into a beautiful dancer. Bruno sings a song about how Gemma is still going/flowing, and I think he needs a lie down. More crying! DRINK! Aljaz is all aboard a cardboard tram, and I\u2019d forgotten how much bench action this dance has. It feels like a rather safe dance to finish your Strictly journey on, but they do deliver it beautifully. Gemma looks glorious, and so ridiculously happy. I love these two. It\u2019s time for Gemma and Aljaz! They\u2019re dancing their American Smooth to \u2018Downtown\u2019 by Petula Clark from Week 9. They bagged a couple of tens, but it was in Blackpool on the enormous sprung floor (DRINK). Can they make it work in the less salubrious surroundings of Elstree and Borehamwood? This is Giovanni\u2019s favourite Strictly, he tells us. Feel the burn, Georgia. Tens all round. Obviously. Bruno thought it was sublime, and it was even better than the first time round (when he gave it a ten). Debbie has been a huge inspiration to millions of people. Craig agrees - this is not the end for Debbie, it\u2019s a new beginning. Darcey thought Debbie was stunningly fearless, it was incredible and she was blown away. Shirley thought it was brilliant, and she loved how Giovanni\u2019s choreography was so sensitive and caring - Debbie agrees that he\u2019s put her first and let her shine from the beginning. Something in my eye. It feels only right that the Strictly caf\u00e9 table/lamppost should make an appearance in the final. This Argentine is still entirely fabulous, Debbie looks right at home in this dance, and Giovanni does a wonderful job of making this all about her. A Strictly classic, and I\u2019m a bit goosebumpy. Goodness, this is all quite emotional. So happy for Debbie, it feels like Strictly has been genuinely life-changing for her. Next up it\u2019s Debbie and Giovanni, dancing their Week 10 Argentine Tango to \u2018Por Una Cabeza\u2019. Ooh, this is risky for a final dance, but they totally nailed this a few weeks back and picked up a couple of 10s, so fingers crossed they can deliver the goods again. I\u2019m really surprised they aren\u2019t doing their Four Tens Tango from Week 7 \u2013 maybe there\u2019s nowhere to go after Craig has worshipped at your feet? Scores: 10s all round. Quite right too. Crying! DRINK! Shirley thought it was pure brilliance from start to finish, they\u2019ve been magnificent this season. Bruno thought he was watching Tina live - it was his favourite dance of the season. Craig gives Alex a standing ovation, and Darcey agrees that Alex is shining bright. This Jive is incredible, it has EVERYTHING. Alexandra should totally win this. She probably won\u2019t, but definitely should. Gorka is crying! DRINK! Alexandra and Gorka are up first, dancing their Tina Turner Jive to \u2018Proud Mary\u2019 from Week 4. This was an absolute showstopper, I\u2019m so pleased they are dancing it again. Time for a montage! DRINK! Time for the final round \u2013 each couple get to dance their favourite dance of the series. It\u2019s their last chance to win hearts, minds and votes, so this had better be good. Daughter has voted for Gemma and Alex on that round, and I agree. One for being brilliant, the other for exceeding my expectations and giving it mega-sass. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - bring back grumpy Len, all is forgiven. Joe and Katya are doing their toy soldier Charleston. Ah, I don\u2019t think I liked that either. SORRY JOE. Darcey didn\u2019t want the fairytale to end, and Shirley agrees that Joe has come a long way. Bruno loved the originality, and Joe and Katya\u2019s dance had a real magic about it. Craig loved how showbiz it was, Joe is just great. So this opens with a bit of Prince Charming/Cinderella waltz, and then a dodgy orchestra version of Hall &amp; Oates kicks in and it gets a bit weird. OK, now it\u2019s faster, but still weird. Katya is already on her third dress, and I feel like this is more about her than Joe. Hmm, I\u2019m not sure about that. Just all a bit bizarre, didn\u2019t like the music, and not my favourite Showdance (sorry). Joe and Katya! Their Showdance is to \u2018You Make My Dreams\u2019 by Hall &amp; Oates. I can\u2019t imagine this middle-of-the-road dad tune being right for anything other than bopping about in a random fashion; but this is Joe and Katya, so presumably they have something special up their glittery sleeves. Scores: 8,9,10,10 - it\u2019s all madness. Gemma and Aljaz are doing \u2018Downtown\u2019 - their dance from Blackpool. American Smooth, I think? Craig liked it but he didn\u2019t love it - he liked that Gemma danced in ways he hadn\u2019t seen before, and he could see how Gemma has grown as a dancer. Darcey loved sassy Gemma, it had great attack and brilliant staging and choreography. Shirley loved how fierce and packed with attitude it was, Gemma gave it 1000%. Bruno thought it was a \u2018Quicksexy\u2019 (not a thing), and the Quickstep was technically perfect. Loving Gemma\u2019s crimpy wig, this is already amazing. Good opening leg action, and Gemma is clearly in it to win it. Bags of attitude and sass, plenty of dance content, but a bit clunky in some of the lifts. Don\u2019t care, I loved that. Gemma is definitely not out of the running. It\u2019s time for Gemma and Aljaz! Their Showdance will be danced to \u2018Show Me How You Burlesque\u2019 by Christina Aguilera. I LOVE this song, but it\u2019s only going to work if Gemma goes full Burlesque and works those cabaret sequins to the max. COME ON GEMMA, YOU CAN DO THIS. Scores: 9,9,10,10 - Shirley and Bruno only have one paddle, apparently. For their final dance, Debbie and Giovanni have picked their Argentine Tango. Ooh, RISKY. Bruno thought Debbie was flying like an angelic ballerina \u2013 she\u2019s every little girl\u2019s dream. Craig thought it was dangerous doing classical ballet with \u201cDarcey Bustop\u201d on the panel, but Debbie pulled it off. Darcey thought it was extraordinary work, and Shirley thought it showed how far Debbie has come. OK, if I\u2019m playing devil\u2019s advocate, it COULD be argued that Debbie just showed us what she could already do pre-Strictly, rather than what she\u2019s learned on the show. Still loved it, mind. Debbie is a dancer in a music box, until Giovanni rescues her and she ditches the tutu. It\u2019s basically Debbie\u2019s ballerina greatest hits, but entirely dreamy and gorgeous, with some incredible lifts and spins. They\u2019re definitely not holding back on the showdances this year, that was incredible. Next up it\u2019s Debbie and Giovanni! Their Showdance will be danced to \u2018One Day I\u2019ll Fly Away\u2019 by Vaults. Basically this is the John Lewis version of the Randy Crawford classic. I\u2019m guessing this is going to be quite contempo-waft heavy, because why on earth wouldn\u2019t you, if you were Debbie? ALL the splits and straight leg action. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - after a while, the tens start to get a bit meaningless, don\u2019t they? If you\u2019re not going to give a ten, Craig, at least say why not. Next up - Alexandra is dancing the Proud Mary Jive! YES - I loved that. Shirley thought it was fun, bright and Alex has come into her own. Bruno thought it had all the hits, it was Alex\u2019s greatest hits, wrapped as a beautiful tribute to the movies. Craig loved Alex\u2019s natural ability, and it had incredible energy - he loved it. Darcey loved Alex\u2019s unfailing focus, Alex is a real artist. Alex is looking glorious in as the Quality Street green triangle, and Gorka is about as dashing as it gets. Wait the green dress is now a gold! This is a super-fast affair with just about every dance style going. It\u2019s quite frantic, but entirely spectacular. Now THAT\u2019S a Showdance. First up it\u2019s Alexandra and Gorka! They\u2019re dancing their Showdance to \u2018There\u2019s No Business Like Showbusiness\u2019 by Ethel Merman, presumably because this kind of character-driven, Charleston-heavy showdance is absolutely Alex\u2019s happy place. I\u2019m very much looking forward to this. It\u2019s Showdance Time! This is an opportunity for all our couples to show off what they do best, and don\u2019t spare the horses. Lifts, spinning, back flips, barefoot contempo-wafting \u2013 anything goes. Further sighting of Anton in the wild! DRINK! First recap of the evening! DRINK! And the voting is...OPEN. The daughter is giving one vote after each dance - after that, she\u2019s gone for Joe. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - not sure what Craig\u2019s scoring criteria is this evening, but it feels quite random. Darcey saw improvement in Joe\u2019s posture, and it had wonderful glide and flow - one of her favourite dances of the series. Shirley thought it was big, bold and beautiful, and she\u2019d give Joe an 11 for his fleckerl. Bruno fell in love all over again - it had added flow, like Joe and Katya were skating on a frozen lake. Craig loved that it was a no-nonsense Viennese, and it had superb drama and storytelling. Well this is entirely dreamy, and making me feel quite festive in a way it didn\u2019t in Week 3. Joe\u2019s Viennese looks a bit flatter than last time, and still packed with charm. Ah, it\u2019s snowing! Magical. And finally in this round, it\u2019s Joe and Katya! The judges have chosen their Movie Week Viennese Waltz to \u2018Somewhere My Love\u2019 from Dr Zhivago. I loved this dance back in Week 3 \u2013 Joe made a splendid Cossack and Katya\u2019s fur-trimmed outfit was just about the best outfit Strictly has ever produced. Scores: 9,9,10,10 - a total of 38 for Gemma and Aljaz. Craig loved the strong lines an fantastic intent - the dance really suits Gemma\u2019s frame. Darcey loved the determination and drama, and Gemma held on to the passion until the very end. Shirley got the shaping she was looking for. \u201cThe mind is like a parachute, it works best when it\u2019s open\u201d, says Shirley. It could be argued that a parachute that doesn\u2019t open is basically a deathtrap, but let\u2019s not argue with a Ballas metaphor. Aston aside (SOB), this was my favourite Paso of the series, and you can tell from this performance how much Gemma wants to win that glitterball. Great intent and drive and better shaping, but her chin still needs to come up. Still, LOVED that. It\u2019s time for Gemma and Aljaz! Their judges\u2019 pick is their Week 4 Paso Doble to \u2018Viva La Vida\u2019 by Coldplay. This featured Gemma in pink webbing and Aljaz\u2019s lovely arms, and was very much my kind of Paso. Scores: 9, 10, 10, 10. Oh come on Craig, it\u2019s not like it matters. Bruno thought Debbie defied the laws of physics and times. Craig loved the rotation in the hips and the underarm lift was spectacular. Darcey loves the chemistry in Debbie and Giovanni\u2019s partnership, she just wants to bottle a bit of Debbie McGee. Shirley thought it was fantastic \u2013 they all agree she is the brilliant Debbie McGee. Shirley\u2019s attempts at rhyme have been one of my favourite bits of this series. HA, I\u2019d forgotten about the random optician opening. DEBEH! This feels a bit softer in the knees and more assured from Debbie, and the spins and lifts are better on the way in. A bit clunky on the way out of the Fanjo Lift, however, and a bumpy landing at the end. I don\u2019t suppose the judges will care. Next up it\u2019s Debbie and Giovanni! The judges have chosen their Week 8 Salsa to \u2018Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You\u2019 by Boys Town Gang. This was the one that featured the infamous Glove Puppet Fanjo Spin, but I also recall that Debbie was all a bit stiff and ladylike in her Salsa basics, so would be great to see her loosen up a bit. Scores: 10,10,10,10 - not sure where we go from here. Anton in the Clauditorium! DRINK! Shirley thought it captured the essence of what Strictly was about - it brought out Alex\u2019s softer side and was exquisite. Bruno thought it was lovely and fragrant, and Alex put her heart and soul into it. Craig thought it was dreadful, because he couldn\u2019t find a single thing wrong with it (cruel, Craig). Darcey loved how Alex worked with every beat of the music. Four tens to kick us off, anyone? Alexandra has ditched the Mary Poppins hat and coat, which is wise, considering this is My Fair Lady. I loved this dance in Week 3, and I still love it now \u2013 full of charm and joy. Alex looks so much more confident and happy now, it\u2019s lovely to see. Well that was gorgeous. Right, let\u2019s get the dancing started! First up it\u2019s Alexandra and Gorka! The judges have chosen their Movie Week American Smooth to \u2018Wouldn\u2019t It Be Lovely\u2019 from My Fair Lady. This scored 8s and 9s back in Week 3, with some griping from the judges about Alexandra needing to use the space better out of hold (whatever that means). Anyway, it\u2019s reasonable to assume they will have ironed out any issues 10 weeks on. The judges have gone all out - love Darcey\u2019s ballgown and the creeping sparkle on Shirley\u2019s classy frock. Ed Sheeran! DRINK! It\u2019s our very last TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH! Tess in a scarlet peplum pantsuit with dodgy flares, Clauds in a ratty old navy curtain. DID THEY GET DRESSED IN THE DARK? Time for our first group dance, Keep your eyes peeled for Anton. Goodness Oti is a goddess. I could watch her all week. Aljaz, Giovanni, Gorka and Katya are all on pedestals, which is exactly where they belong. They\u2019ve all been incredible this year. Well this is fun. I\u2019m now totally ready to party. Goodness, here\u2019s another montage. KEEP DRINKING. I still can\u2019t watch these credits without thinking of the Aston and Janette Showdance that never was. SOB. Right, let\u2019s get the Strictly Grand Final party started. And we\u2019re kicking off with our first montage of Strictly memories, so DRINK. YES, I had two Pointless answers, and the daughter had one for Peter Dinklage in Elf. We win at Christmas. Christmas on Pointless - I\u2019d have to go for the Christmas Number Ones. That\u2019s My Goal by Shayne Ward, Two Become One by The Spice Girls and Sound Of The Underground by Girls Aloud. It\u2019s time for our final Strictly Come Bingo of the season! I\u2019d originally planned a rollover of all previous bingos, but you\u2019ll all be too plastered to watch the Showdance. Not that I plan to be kind to your livers - let\u2019s see if we can get a full house out of this lot: Best bits montages Interminable recaps Any sighting of Anton Du Beke Crying Mentions of Ed Sheeran Alexandra and Gorka are the best dancers and have given us some absolute showstoppers this year, which means they\u2019re unlikely to win because the best dancer rarely does. Debbie is now a bona fide National Treasure, and could easily win the nation\u2019s heart with plenty of splits and reminders that\u2019s she\u2019s old enough to be the mother of everyone else on that dancefloor. Joe and Katya have never been in the dance-off and have the most inventive choreography, so there\u2019s no doubt they could lift the Glitterball later. I\u2019d originally excluded Gemma and Aljaz from tonight\u2019s top spot, but Aljaz knows exactly what it takes to win, and Gemma could easily take the journey prize if she find can find an extra gear for their Showdance. So actually all four couples are in with a genuine chance, which is all rather exciting. Also the judges votes count for nothing for the first time, so it\u2019s all down to the public. About time too. So who\u2019s going to win this year? My highly unscientific Twitter poll says Joe and Katya, but last year everyone said Danny and Oti and ranked Ore and Joanne last, so what does Twitter know. Evening all, and a very warm welcome to the 2017 Strictly Come Dancing Grand Final liveblog! After three months of dance, drama, debating and tapping away at this keyboard like a demon, we\u2019ve whittled down our original 15 couples to a final four \u2013 Alexandra and Gorka, Debbie and Giovannia, Gemma and Aljaz and Joe and Katyal. All that\u2019s keeping one of them from holding aloft the Strictly glitterball is three final dances. So here\u2019s the plan for tonight\u2019s show \u2013 all four couples are dancing three routines back to back \u2013 a dance picked by the Judges, a brand new Showdance and each couple\u2019s favourite dance of the series. Like last year, there is no elimination after two dances, so all four couples are dancing all three dances; and there is also no return of the much-loved half hour break in the middle which used to give the poor liveblogger a chance to eat, stretch and go for a wee. Of course last year there were only three couples \u2013 this year it\u2019s a four-couple non-stop Strictly train that lasts for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. Gird your loins for a bucketload of pro dances, musical interludes, montages and recaps. Bring every snack food item and half-drunk bottle of booze you can find. Kick off is at 6.30pm \u2013 it\u2019s the last Strictly of the season and I suspect it\u2019s going to be a cracker, so bring your sparkliest dancing shoes. See you in a bit!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
