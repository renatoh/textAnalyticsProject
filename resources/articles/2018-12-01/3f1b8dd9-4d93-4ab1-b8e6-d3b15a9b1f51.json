The crisis call on Monday between US financial regulators and the US treasury department failed to assure markets, and stocks fell again amid concern about slowing economic growth, the continuing government shutdown, and reports that Trump had discussed firing the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones plummeted 653 points in a shortened trading day on Monday, capping its worst week in a decade and reportedly marking its \u201cworst day of Christmas Eve trading ever\u201d. Investors appeared increasingly skittish. The S&amp;P 500 also dropped 2.7%, leaving it on pace for its biggest percentage decline in December since the Great Depression and indicating a move to a bear market, according to CNBC. In a tweet that did nothing to ease market concerns about the Fed\u2019s cherished independence, Trump laid the blame for economic headwinds firmly at the feet of the central bank. \u201cThe only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don\u2019t have a feel for the market,\u201d Trump said on Twitter. \u201cThe Fed is like a powerful golfer who can\u2019t score because he has no touch \u2013 he can\u2019t putt!\u201d Trump has frequently criticized the Fed\u2019s raising of interest rates this year and has gone after Powell several times, telling Reuters in August he was \u201cnot thrilled\u201d with his own appointee. The Fed increased rates again last week. The drops came despite the US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s attempts to calm wary investors over the weekend. Mnuchin said on Sunday that he had called CEOs from the nation\u2019s six largest banks \u2013 Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. Mnuchin said these banks had promised him that they had enough money on hand, despite the fact that concerns over liquidity did not appear to have previously shaken the market. Before these tweets, Mnuchin sought to dispel reports that Trump wanted to axe Powell over the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates. Trump nevertheless railed against the Federal Reserve on Monday. Traders seemed to react to the sudden resignations of the defense secretary, James Mattis, and the anti-Isis coalition leader Brett McGurk over Trump\u2019s snap decision to pull US troops from Syria last week. Trump reportedly forced Mattis to step down two months early, apparently angry that Mattis openly criticized his policies. The partial government shutdown went into effect at midnight on Friday after Donald Trump\u2019s demands for border wall funding left lawmakers in a stalemate. Trump tweeted on Monday that he was \u201call alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats\u201d to make a deal. \u201cInstead of bringing certainty into people\u2019s lives, he\u2019s continuing the Trump Shutdown just to please rightwing radio and TV hosts,\u201d Schumer and Pelosi said in their joint statement, arguing that it was unclear what exactly what the president was trying to get out of the shutdown. \u201cDifferent people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not accept to end his Trump shutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment,\u201d they said. \u201cThe president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it.\u201d House and Senate members could not broker a deal before Congress\u2019s adjournment for the holiday and prior to this deadlock, however, and Trump warned of a \u201cvery long shutdown\u201d. While the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, appeared open to reconvening before the session resumes Thursday if a deal were brokered, the House majority whip Steve Scalise\u2019s staff told ABC News a vote would not take place before Thursday. Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s new acting White House chief of staff, also painted a bleak picture during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. Trump won\u2019t step back from his \u201cfight over border security\u201d, Mulvaney said. \u201cI don\u2019t think things are going to move very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance this could go into the next Congress.\u201d More than 420,000 federal employees will work without getting paid during the partial shutdown."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
