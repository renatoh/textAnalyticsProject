The criticism of the behaviour of the Foreign Office minister follows a damning attack from the watchdog committee on John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, who was found to have put pressure on a witness giving evidence to Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner. Mr Vaz was largely cleared by the Commons standards and privileges committee of breaching the MPs' code of conduct or Parliament's registration procedures but the report reveals intimidation and threats by Labour party activists. It said: \"This inquiry has taken far too long. If Mr Vaz and other witnesses whom the commissioner asked for information had answered her questions fully and promptly, the commissioner would have been able to complete her report in a much shorter time.\" It singles out Colin Hall, chairman of Mr Vaz's Leicester East Labour party, for particular criticism. It says his threat to put legal and disciplinary pressure on one of the witnesses, Mustapha Kamal, is \"a serious contempt\". Two other officers of the local party, Piara Singh Clair and John Thomas, are condemned for a \"consistently unhelpful attitude ... intended to frustrate the commissioner's investigation.\" Mr Vaz ended up refusing to answer any of Ms Filkin's questions and is chastised by the committee for breaking the code of conduct in not cooperating with her. On the one charge which is upheld - the recommending of an honour for Sarosh Zaiwalla, a City lawyer, without disclosing that he was a Labour donor - Ms Filkin is particularly scathing. She accuses him of initially denying he had accepted two small donations until she had documentary proof - and then refusing to disclose the finances of his family firm, Mapesbury Communications. Ms Filkin was also unable to complete her inquiries into eight allegations because Mr Vaz, his family and Labour party officials declined to co-operate. On his family company, she says: \"Mr Vaz could and should have been more forthcoming in answering my questions about Mapesbury Communications ... given the role of Mr Vaz's wife as director and sole shareholder, it appears beyond doubt that Mr Vaz had direct access to the relevant information.\" Mr Vaz yesterday condemned the 13-month inquiry: \"Whilst I fully support the need to ensure that MPs maintain the highest possible standards of probity, the present procedures give too much latitude to the purveyors of lies and malice,\" he said. His lawyer, Geoffrey Bindman, said: \"I don't think it is right to say he did not cooperate. In some cases, he did not answer questions fully because he wasn't told clearly what the allegations were.\" Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, called on Mr Vaz to resign: \"The minister for Europe has become Mr Stonewall. Frankly, he is quite unfit to represent Britain. A Foreign Office minister, of all people, must have total integrity or his word would not be trusted.\" Downing Street and Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, backed Mr Vaz. Mr Cook said: \"I am very pleased for him. I hope he can now be allowed to get back to doing the job that he does very well.\" Useful link Standards and privileges committee report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
