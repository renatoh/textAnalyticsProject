The Serbian forward will cost an initial \u20ac65m before add-ons. \u201cReal Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt have agreed the transfer of Luka Jovic, subject to a medical,\u201d the Spanish club confirmed on Tuesday. \u201cThe player will be tied to the club for the next six seasons, until 30 June 2025.\u201d Jovic joined Eintracht on loan from Benfica in 2017, with the club eventually agreeing to make the move permanent at the end of the past season, in which he scored 17 goals in 32 Bundesliga appearances, as well as 10 in 14 Europa League games. \u201cFrom a sporting point of view selling Luka Jovic is a big blow,\u201d said the Eintracht Frankfurt sporting director, Fredi Bobic. \u201cHis explosiveness and capacity to score goals propelled us into Europe and we have benefited from more than just his goals in the past two years. \u201cBut it was clear that there was a limit to what kind of bid we could refuse. For Eintracht Frankfurt this is a good and important transfer. We wish Luka all the best in the future. He has all the attributes to have a great career. And we are proud that we have supported him on his way.\u201d In March, Real Madrid announced the signing of \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o from Porto for this summer, the 21-year-old centre-back becoming the first transfer since Zinedine Zidane returned to manage the club. Meanwhile, the former Madrid and Spain coach Julen Lopetegui \u2013 sacked by both last year \u2013 has been appointed as Sevilla\u2019s new head coach."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
