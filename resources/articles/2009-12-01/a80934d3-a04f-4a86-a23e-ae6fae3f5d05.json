Mr Justice Laws, sitting with Mr Justice Owen, ruled in the high court today that two men suspected of terrorism-related activities could not be denied bail solely on the basis of secret evidence. Gareth Peirce, the solicitor for both men, described the judgment as a \"historic\" victory while the home secretary said he would appeal. \"My sole objective is protecting the public, and this judgment makes that job harder,\" said Johnson. \"We will do everything possible to keep this country safe and are taking steps accordingly in the light of this unhelpful judgment.\" The ruling was a victory for an Algerian national, known as U, and a 23-year-old Pakistani student, XC, one of 10 students arrested in north-west England in April as part of Operation Pathway. The judges said their bail applications should be treated on the same basis as control order cases after the law lords ruled in June that terror suspects had to be given the \"irreducible minimum\" of material about the case against them. Jonathan Glasson, appearing for the home secretary, said XC and U, were \"potentially to be released on bail, notwithstanding the existence of closed evidence indicating they might abscond\". The judges delayed the release of both men to give the Special Immigration Appeals Commission time to ask the court of appeal to consider the case. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, said: \"Yet again, it takes a senior judge to point what most people already know: if the government is going to lock you up, it needs to tell you why.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
