It is made in black and white, and uses non-professionals, including the director's mother, Susanna Pasolini, as the older Mary, mother of Christ. The musical score switches sharply from Bach's St Matthew Passion to classic blues. Enrique Irazoqui's Jesus is eerily, almost disturbingly self-possessed, emerging from the landscape like Bergman's Death in The Seventh Seal. His rhetoric is ceaseless and fluent, and his sermonising is persistently presented as a kind of dreamlike montage of inspired insights and mysterious aper\u00e7us, with Pasolini's camera jump-cutting from Jesus's face at different places and times. This really is raw film-making, in a political vernacular which speaks of Pasolini's high, theocratic Marxist belief in the sovereignty of the people, like the publicans and the harlots that Christ said understood him. The texture and feel of what's on the screen is abrasive and uncompromising, and moments such as the hanging of Judas Iscariot are almost unwatchably violent, as is the strangely unselfconscious innocence of the curing of the leper. A fierce magnesium flame of a movie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
