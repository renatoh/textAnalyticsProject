In the new post-virus cannibal epic Doomsday, for example, the survivors wear lurid punk hairstyles, facial tattoos and enormous stompy boots. It's as if 80s pop loons Sigue Sigue Sputnik have become the dominant race on the planet. Why is it that our film-makers think it will be this way? After all, with 99 per cent of the population gone, there will be countless clothes shops left to loot; even all-out nuclear war can't get rid of them all. Still, it's clearly seen as more effective to put our hero in an appalling pair of leather trousers, and to give his main enemy a Mohawk, an inexplicable nose-ring and big stompy boots to clomp around in. With the help of Guardian fashion expert Hadley Freeman, let us celebrate some of post-apocalyptic cinema's worst ever outfits... Tank girl (1995) Nature of apocalypse: Nuclear. The look: Peroxide blonde hair, heavy make-up, pilot's goggles, baggy jeans worn low in the hip-hop style. And big boots. Hadley's verdict: \"She's a dead ringer for Gwen Stefani: savage blonde hair with random pink bits, chunky boots. It is obvious that one has taken inspiration from the other, but while one is lauded as a musical icon, the other has no career. Fame, you are a fickle mistress.\" The postman (1997) Nature of apocalypse: Nuclear. The look: Kevin Costner in long leather trenchcoat, wraparound shades, scarves and sundry accessories. Hadley's verdict: \"Just as he does in his film-making, Costner fearlessly and, some might say, unwisely plays with genre: it's a bit grunge, it's a bit hippy and it's a bit lumberjack. The result, like the film, is, to use the proper fashion term, 'well dodgy'.\" The terminator (1984) Nature of apocalypse: Robot uprising. The look: Utilitarian urban military gear with a big flasher's mac over the top. Medium-sized boots. Hadley's verdict: \"With his fondness for baggy army surplus, John Connor created the template for young men wishing to express a nihilistic disintrest in the world, i.e, all British and American teenagers throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\" Escape from New York (1981) Nature of apocalypse: Social breakdown. The look: Kurt Russell in tight trousers, sleeveless black leather vest, eyepatch. And big boots. Nature of apocalypse: \"People in 1981 expected folk in '98 Manhattan to dress like this. And with that fondness for tight trousers, ripped vests, chain-based accessories and tattoos, they weren't wrong. In fact, I had a taxi driver who looked a bit like this last time I went.\" Mad Max 2 (1981) Nature of apocalypse: Nuclear. The look: Mel Gibson wearing head-to-toe black leather with numerous accessories. Including, of course, that all-important pair of biker boots. Hadley's verdict: \"There will apparently be no mirrors available after The Bomb, or else everyone will realise that they look less like terrifying warriors of the new underclass and more like camp icons from a gay biker bar.\" Waterworld (1995) Nature of apocalypse: Global warming. The look: It's Kevin Costner again, this time in a brown leather singlet, tight brown leather trousers and fingerless gloves. Gills - model's own. No big boots. Hadley's verdict: \"Baffling. Why isn't this man wearing waterproof clothes? Surely any half-fish, half-human could see those rags wouldn't work in the waves. Poor planning, wardrobe department.\" Zardoz (1974) Nature of apocalypse: Disease. The look: Totally absurd. Long pigtail and bushy moustache, thigh boots, red codpiece. And that's it. Hadley's verdict: \"I think we should applaud Sean Connery's fashion-forwardness: the crossed braces are ever so Galliano and as for that strange nappy, well, eat your heart out, David Beckham! In fact, I don't know about you, but I'm feeling a little bit turned on.\" Doomsday (2008) Nature of apocalypse: Viral. The look: Ornate facial tattoos, punk hairstyles, studded belts and collars, piercings. And big boots. Again. Hadley's verdict: \"It's downright dangerous to leave Scottish people to their own devices. They'll snarl, they'll paint their faces blue and they'll start wearing clothes that appear to have come out of Tintin. Rob Roy: you have so much to answer for.\" \u00b7 Doomsday is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
