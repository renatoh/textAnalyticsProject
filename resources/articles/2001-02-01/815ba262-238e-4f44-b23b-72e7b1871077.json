Yet on Saturday they played like dogs. Tranmere, in severe danger of dropping from the First Division, should surely be saving their best performances for the relegation battle. But once more they lifted themselves to a higher plane in the Cup, a competition they have no realistic hope of winning. Why do they do it? \"I'm sick of answering that question,\" replied their manager John Aldridge, clearly perplexed by it. His team's giant-killing Cup runs have claimed six Premiership scalps in recent seasons, including last month's fourth-round win at Everton. But neither that nor this plucky draw that means a replay tomorrow, could make up for what happened to them in the First Division in their absence. \"To come in at full-time and find we had gone bottom of the league was a real sickener,\" said the veteran striker Paul Rideout. \"It will mean nothing to us winning the FA Cup if we get relegated. Even a win on Tuesday night [in the replay] means nothing if we go down.\" The worry is turning into a health hazard for Aldridge. \"I never stop thinking about it,\" he admits. \"I can't sleep at night. It's doing me in.\" It seems that, unlike many of the top clubs, those in the lower divisions find the magic of the Cup irresistible. It is one of the illogical laws of the old trophy. And here is another: Premiership sides will always underestimate the threat of lesser opposition no matter how many pre-match warnings the manager issues. \"We worked all this week on not under-estimating them,\" said Glenn Hoddle. \"But we had too many players on five or six out of ten out there. We didn't create enough. There wasn't enough good play out there to deserve the victory.\" Not even a half-time roasting could improve matters. \"I had a few stern words with them. But we let ourselves down today. There is a feeling around the city that, with relegation less of a worry, this could be our year in the Cup. But you've got to go and do it.\" Southampton boasted the bulk of possession and did have the ball in the back of the net three times. But each effort was disallowed, two for offside and one for impeding the goalkeeper. The first decision was the only dubious one, as the man ruled offside when Dean Richards headed in did not seem to be interfering with play. Tranmere's goalkeeper John Achterberg also saved well from Marian Pahars, who otherwise was disappointing, as was James Beattie. Recently touted as an England possible, he played more like a striker heading for a call-up to Southampton reserves. Tranmere had Clint Hill carried off with an ankle injury but even without him the defence performed heroically around the veteran Richard Jobson. Merseyside's poor relations lacked attacking invention, though, and their best two chances were presented to Andy Parkinson via South ampton errors. First Jo Tessem's slip left the nippy striker free on goal but Paul Jones pulled off an instinctive save from the ensuing shot. Then a Richards error let in Parkinson again and only Claus Lundekvam's last-ditch tackle saved the day. And so to the replay. Hill is doubtful for Tranmere but Southampton's plight is worse. Matthew Oakley has joined an already large injury list, Dan Petrescu is Cup-tied, Tahar El Khalej is on international duty and Hoddle admits he will have to call up some youngsters. Poor old Tranmere. No one is helping them get their priorities right. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
