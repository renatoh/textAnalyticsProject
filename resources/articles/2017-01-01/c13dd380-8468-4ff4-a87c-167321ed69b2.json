But at the time of the Norman conquest, Dunwich, on the Suffolk coast, was a thriving port, second only to London in terms of trade and importance. It was the capital of the Kingdom of the East Angles, and boasted a rich and growing population. What could possibly go wrong? Then, on the night of 1 January 1286, a huge storm surge swept in from the North Sea, flooding much of the town and destroying buildings, including several churches. The following year two further floods hit the town, in February and December. The port kept going, though trade was much reduced. But gradually, over the decades that followed, more storms eroded even more of the coast: in 1328, when two priories were swept away; and in 1347, when 400 houses and two more churches were destroyed. By then the problem was that the shingle bank that had once protected the port had been swept into the harbour, preventing boats from entering and leaving. With the coming of the plague in the same year, Dunwich\u2019s days of power were over. And in January 1362, the \u201cGrote Mandrenke\u201d (Great Drowning) finally put paid to the town. Today Dunwich is a small and picturesque village, with few obvious signs of its former fame. But local legend claims that on some nights, if you listen carefully, you may still hear the bells of those lost churches ringing from the deep."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
