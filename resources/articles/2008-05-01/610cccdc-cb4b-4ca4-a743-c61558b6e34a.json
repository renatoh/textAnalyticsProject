Hart's lively introductions are almost worth the admission alone, although she modestly admits that they are built on the scholarly achievement of others. \"I do try not to make any mistakes, but if there are any, I'll echo Dr Johnson when challenged by a woman as to why there was a wrong definition in his dictionary: 'Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance'.\" So before we heard the \"bewildering\" psycho-sexual folk tale that is Rossetti's long 1862 poem \"Goblin Market\", Hart told us how Rossetti had twice turned away from the chance of love and marriage, preferring to dedicate herself to God. \"Though, on the evidence of 'Goblin Market', she literally thirsted for sexual, as well as spiritual, ecstasy. Virginia Woolf said that, if she was making a case against God, her first witness would be Christina Rossetti.\" \u00b7 The readers were Charles Dance - relaxedly sockless in slippers and a chic crumpled grey suit; Joanna David - wife and mother respectively of regular Hart readers Edward and Emilia Fox; and Nancy Carroll who, Hart told us, had recently had a baby. \"Who is not in the audience tonight as Nancy's reading of 'Goblin Market' would be far too unsuitable.\" And so David and Carroll launched into the heated - pre-Freudian - story of two sisters' sexually and spiritually ambiguous dealings with the market-trading Goblins. There was much plump ripe fruit, oozing juice - lots and lots of juice - and temptation accompanied not only by \"tingling\", \"squeezing\" and \"dripping\", but also by \"sucking\", \"trickling\" and \"grunting\", as the sisters found different ways to negotiate the Goblins' wares. The audience was palpably flushed by the end of the 20-minute performance and Hart excitedly exclaimed: \"That was marvellous, girls.\" Throughout her life, Rossetti insisted the poem was just a fairy story, but while she might have been chaste, Hart explained, \"she was not a prude\", having worked in a house for fallen women and witnessed her brother's debauchery. The critic Margaret Reynolds got it right: \"Once upon a time Christina Rossetti was simple, but that was a long time ago.\" \u00b7 After the \"fire\" of Rossetti came the \"ice\" of Bishop, as Charles Dance took the mood down an octave or four to read poetry that aimed to be \"as normal as sight and as unusual as a glass eye\". Dance and Carroll affected American accents for \"Songs for a Colored Singer\" - \"I'm going to go and take the bus / and find someone monogamous\" - and Hart noted that, like many writers who fear displacement, Bishop had a wonderful sense of place, and that while her early poems were emotionally cool, her later work dredged up the pain of a traumatic childhood to \"become filled with existential terror\". But there was room for humour: Bishop asked that her tombstone be engraved \"Awful but cheerful\". The Poetry Hour - after a successful trip to New York, where Mark Strong and Brian Dennehy read Lowell and Frost - plans to visit Paris next. A second book and CD of readings will be distributed to all schools in November and the season closes, as does every season, with a reading of first world war poems in June.
