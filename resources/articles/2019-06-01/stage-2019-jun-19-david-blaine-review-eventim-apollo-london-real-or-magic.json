That 2003 stunt backfired, but the stupefaction quotient is high in his touring show Real or Magic? which showcases Blaine\u2019s magic as well as the lengths to which he can push his body. So too is the squirm quotient \u2013 I spent a fair chunk of the show looking at anything but the stage. Squeamish viewers (that\u2019s me!) will wonder how anyone could be entertained by the spectacle of a man piercing his biceps with a metal spike. Or, for that matter, vomiting up pints of water on demand to extinguish a fire. But even if the horror is sometimes a painful watch, the point it\u2019s making \u2013 Blaine\u2019s supernatural command of his body \u2013 is abundantly made. At the interval, an amateur hypnotist beside me claimed you can trance yourself into not bleeding. That would certainly explain Blaine\u2019s hangdog demeanour: if he\u2019s in a trance, no wonder he\u2019s not perky. I found that this kind of anti-showmanship makes the gruesome moments \u2013 stitching his lips together, say \u2013 feel even more confrontational. Then there\u2019s the act two showstopper, when Blaine submerges himself in a water tank for 10 minutes without breathing. The drama requires cranking up, with live commentary, a countdown and some children loosed on stage to commune with Blaine through the glass. The closing moments are the most human, as Blaine, recovering his puff, shares his belief that \u201cwe can always be amazed at the human body and what it does.\u201d These feats of imperviousness and endurance risk overshadowing the actual magic tricks \u2013 inducing symbiosis in two unrelated audience members; guessing which jigsaw piece among 2,000 that his volunteer (Spider-Man star Tom Holland, as it happens) will choose. But each of them are astonishing, in their less showy way. No one throws eggs; there\u2019s a clamorous standing ovation. \u2022 At Eventim Apollo, London, on 19 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
