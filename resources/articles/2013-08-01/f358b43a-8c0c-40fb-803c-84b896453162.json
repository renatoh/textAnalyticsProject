Philip French championed Boyle's career from the outset, describing his debut feature film, Shallow Grave, as \"a good piece of storytelling... Hitchcock would have admired its ruthlessness and cruel humour.\" A brilliantly learned man with a pitiless mind and a kind eye. How can a critic maintain this balance over such a long time? I've read critics for the best part of 40 years and no one has achieved this balance as exquisitely as Philip French. Of course, some never wanted to and that's fair enough. Except that his approach produces the perfect critic, serving public and artist both. Never more important than the effort he's reviewing, no matter how poor the result, he maintains a balance of decorum between someone who spends two hours in front of it (and sometimes I'm sure it felt like the longest two hours of his life) and those who have spent years creating it, negotiating all the horrors and wonders of making a film. Journey's end can feel like arriving at the point of a needle, judgment itself, only there to meet disdain. Perhaps because his pleasure seemed always to be in finding a context for the film historically, its inspirations and its debts, rather than just judgment itself, Philip French never underestimated a responsibility best expressed in Plato's dictum: Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle. A lovely man. A great critic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
