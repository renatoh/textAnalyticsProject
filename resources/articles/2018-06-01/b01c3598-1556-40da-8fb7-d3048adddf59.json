In the midst of Expo \u201988 mania, everyone sported clothing emblazoned with splashy images of Sydney Harbour Bridge, koalas and Australiana chic. It was bold, brash and people couldn\u2019t get enough of it. By the mid 1990s however, this wave of colour and cultural celebration had faded into a puddle of cultural cringe, in which anything remotely Australian was met with disdain and embarrassment. Yet fashion is a cyclical industry and what falls from grace will inevitably come back into vogue. Fairy bread greeting card from La La Land, $6.95; top: Molly Coombs Marr fairy bread, paddlepops, Iced Vovo and Bubble O Bill earrings from $42.50 Over the past few years, an increasing number of independent labels have taken ownership of these symbols that were once the subject of mockery and made them, well, cool. Australiana 2.0 has arrived. In markets and boutique shops across Australia, you can find Iced VoVo earrings, tea towels featuring hipster koalas and Vegemite and Golden Gaytime ice-cream enamel pins. Pete Cromer, whose label of the same name creates prints and key rings of colourful stylised budgies, koalas and kangaroos, likens the irreverent nature of his designs with a \u201crebirth\u201d of appreciation of all that is Australian. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a resurgence, like Kath and Kim \u2013 things that are daggy are now also kind of cool. People of a certain generation are more familiar with it and we\u2019re seeing it in a new light.\u201d Cynthia Sear, an anthropologist who researches consumerism and capitalism at the University of Melbourne, says many people enjoy the novelty factor, especially those who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s. \u201cThese items are quite innocent but they\u2019re also quite authentic and genuine, and there\u2019s a bit of irony in them, too.\u201d And unlike other national emblems, such as the Australian flag that has long been the centre of political debate, there\u2019s not a lot that\u2019s political about a pair of banana-shaped earrings. \u201cThese things don\u2019t polarise and they don\u2019t involve issues of race or Indigenous politics. It\u2019s a happy way to celebrate being Australian.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of anthropological theory right now about how we identify ourselves; we\u2019re a more global world now and it lends itself to us thinking about who we are. With the resurgence of these innocent symbols, it\u2019s a way to embrace Australiana that isn\u2019t complicated.\u201d Cromer agrees, adding that it\u2019s a celebration of a culture that many people grew up in and share similar experiences they can bond over. \u201cI think back to my grandma and she loved Iced VoVos and we can now celebrate the way we grew up, because that\u2019s part of our culture. They\u2019re our icons because we all share similar stories and experiences with them.\u201d At a market in Melbourne\u2019s historical Royal Exhibition Building, huge swaths of people mingle, jostling for position in front of each stall. One of the stalls, McKean Studio, sells colourful metal bracelets that have city skylines etched into them. Kate McKean, who opened the business four years ago, says what started as a hobby has found an eager market for those who want a \u201cquality\u201d symbol of their home. \u201cThere are those cheap stores at [Sydney\u2019s] The Rocks and places like that sell kangaroo testicle pouches, but I wanted to create something that really celebrates a lot of the things that we love about Australia,\u201d she says. She adds that what differentiates the new Australiana is the humour that\u2019s laced throughout resurrected Australiana, citing our \u201clovable larrikin outlook\u201d on life.

Other countries, like Germany, are so serious in their culture, that I think it\u2019s a really nice thing to have about Australian culture. We can poke fun at ourselves and our colours are so bright and vivid and we\u2019re just a fun place.\u201d The evolution of cringe to cool started about five years ago, when many makers and small labels first took their products to shops and markets across the country, and where they found an unexpected but growing market. Although small and independent makers have been leading the charge of this trend, mainstream brands have also jumped on board: fashion label Romance was Born released a range with Jenny Kee, and Sheridan and Havaianas have both collaborated with Done. And bed linen label Kipp + Co had a successful run with its May Gibbs collaboration, with her Snugglepot and Cuddlepie characters featuring prominently. The tourist souvenirs that are the subject of such scorn are still around, of course \u2013 stuffed koalas mass-produced in China and plastic keyrings that feature the Gold Coast\u2019s infamous meter maids are still eagerly purchased by tourists wanting to take a piece of Australia with them. Alphabetical Sydney by Antonia Pesenti &amp; Hilary Bell. $24.95 However, Elie Azzi, who curates the collection of cards, prints and other products sold through La La Land, says there\u2019s no link between tourist knick-knacks and Australiana 2.0. \u201cA lot of the Australiana you see in tourist stores tends to be really tacky and not that nice but what we\u2019ve been doing is challenging that and finding art that captures a more beautiful and humorous type of Australia.\u201d He adds that it\u2019s a misconception to think that Australiana is only for the tourist market. \u201cThere is a local appreciation for Australiana. Maybe it was tacky once but now it\u2019s become trendy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
