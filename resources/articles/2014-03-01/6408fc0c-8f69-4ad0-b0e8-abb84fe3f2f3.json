As such, few teams, if any, carry as much pressure going into 2014 as the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Souths were in a similar boat in 2012 and 2013 and both times failed to make, let alone win, the decider. Sam Burgess has only just lost the trout-slapped expression he had on his face after Manly stunned the Rabbitohs in last year\u2019s preliminary final. It was as if Souths just assumed they were destined for the 2013 grand final \u2014and a meeting with the auld enemy, the Roosters\u2014 forgetting they had to actually get the job done. Fairytales do happen in sport, but not on demand. Falling short last season may have taught the Bunnies a thing or two, and could inspire them to greater heights this time around. But then again, Burgess\u2019s impending exit at the end of the season will just remind everyone at Redfern how fleeting is the opportunity to excel. Will Souths get all dry-mouthed and forget their lines again? Souths have lost a lot of experience in the off-season (Roy Asotasi, Mick Crocker, Andrew Everingham, Dylan Farrell) and don\u2019t appear to have covered the gaps, which could be a problem. Nevertheless, Michael Maguire\u2019s Bunnies have maintained their imposing look. Befitting a team that has to haul around a celebrity bandwagon, Souths would have to be one of the biggest teams in league history sporting, as they do, the likes of John Sutton, Greg Inglis, Chris McQueen and Redfern\u2019s version of Mount Rushmore: Sam, George, Luke and Tom Burgess. Issac Luke may look like a jockey in comparison but what the helter skelter hooker lacks in size he makes up for in talent, determination and maleficence. Like Kramer, he\u2019s a loathsome brute yet we can\u2019t look away. This is not a pack that should get dominated. But if Souths are to win the premiership they\u2019ll need their backs to fire, and for brilliant fullback Inglis to get through the season more or less injury-free, something Inglis \u2014who, at his best, is like a demigod\u2014 hasn\u2019t managed in recent years. Souths\u2019 centres Bryson Goodwin and Beau Champion are, in comparison, as flashy as a barber-shop haircut, but they\u2019ll get the job done if given good service from their halves. But here\u2019s the problem. Maguire\u2019s first choice five-eighth for 2014 (what with Sutton having shifted to lock) is Luke Keary. But the budding star tore a pectoral muscle at the Auckland Nines and is gone for months. So Maguire\u2019s pre-season plans and schemes are out the window. It could be that 19-year-old Australian schoolboys star Dylan Walker shifts to five-eighth to partner Adam Reynolds, or that Sutton returns to the No 6 jumper until Keary is fit. Whatever permutation it ends up being, Reynolds will carry a lot of responsibility on his young shoulders. All in all he had a great 2013 (and was in the frame for Origin), but he\u2019ll hope to bring his best game to the biggest games this year and not get shunted to back stage when it matters most. Souths look a top four certainty, if anything can be considered a certainty in rugby league. However, the men in the cardinal and myrtle hoops appear to have lost a little something from last year, meaning they\u2019ll need to find a little something else to end Souths\u2019 42 years of suffering. St George Illawarra Dragons Guardian writers\u2019 season prediction: 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Paul\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: 14th Since Steve Price took over from Wayne Bennett at the end of 2011 he has been afforded a longer period of grace than many Dragons fans would like. But between inheriting an ageing team (minus a few stars Bennett enticed to Newcastle) and being hampered by long-term injuries to key personnel (such as Gerard Beale and Kyle Stanley), Price has not been held solely accountable for the Dragons\u2019 head-slapping, head-banging, pin-sticking performances under his watch. Given the considerable change in playing personnel at the Dragons in the off-season, however, you\u2019d have to think Price\u2019s period of grace is now officially over. How will he coach with his head on the block? The Dragons will begin the year with a vastly changed squad from the one that limped to 14th last season. Gone are 2010 premiership winners such as Matt Cooper, Michael Weyman, Nathan Fien, Matt Prior and Jamie Soward. Gone too are a host of others who never quite kicked on (Daniel Vidot, Chase Stanley), as well as some potential stars that Dragons fans hope will not come back to bite them (Cameron King, Evander Cummins, Jackson Hastings). In their place, St George Illawarra have picked-up Gareth Widdop, half Sam Williams, dangerous utility Joel Thompson, three-quarter Dylan Farrell, prop Mike Cooper (Warrington) and journeyman Michael Witt. Add to these new recruits the barely seen Beale, the gifted, though injury-plagued, Stanley, and Josh Dugan with a full pre-season behind him (although he\u2019s currently injured), and it will be a very different Dragons side running around in 2014. Different on paper, that is. Unless their inept Charity Shield performance was a cunning plan to disarm the opposition, it didn\u2019t put forward a case that things have changed. Of all the new recruits Widdop has the most expectation on his shoulders, and everyone\u2019s keen to see how he\u2019ll perform without having around him the safety net of Cooper Cronk, Cameron Smith and Billy Slater. At five-eighth he will be expected to steer the team around and partly solve the Dragons\u2019 creative ineptitude that plagued them last year. Former Raider Williams, who showed moments of class at Canberra without ever cementing his spot, will be fighting Stanley for the halfback position. But no matter how the halves line up the Dragons will surely be better off this season than last when they had to rely on an out-of-form Soward, an ageing hooker playing out of position (Fien) and the slow and ham-fisted Chase Stanley. On the flanks the Dragons are as well served as anyone with expert finishers Brett Morris and Jason Nightingale, and the jury is out on Beale and Farrell as centres. But as the Charity Shield reminded us, it\u2019s in the forwards the Dragons look lighter than a cr\u00e8me brulee. Prop-turned-lock Trent Merrin is a wonderful ball-player and metre eater but he\u2019s hardly an imposing figure, nor is back-rower turned prop Ben Creagh. So much will be expected of young forwards Jack de Belin, Jack Stockwell, Tyson Frizell and Joel Thompson to step up. At hooker, Mitch Rein has the inside running (particularly now that his main, and some would say better, rival Craig Garvey is under investigation for an alleged assault at a Wollongong nightclub), but he needs to improve his game. He\u2019s a tackling machine but he can all have the vision of Mr Magoo in attack. His creative credentials are far from proven. Given the Dragons\u2019 halves recruitment, and the availability of Beale and Stanley, who are like two new signings, it\u2019s hard to see the Dragons going quite as badly as last year. But do they \u2014 and Price \u2014 have it in them to sneak into the finals? You wouldn\u2019t put your money on it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
