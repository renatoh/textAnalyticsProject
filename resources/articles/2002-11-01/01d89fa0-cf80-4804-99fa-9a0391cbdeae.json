Sharia has been declared in only 12 of the Nigerian Federation's 31 states, since its introduction in Zamfara state in 2000. But because 12 northern states tend to form a solid bloc of votes without which President Olusegun Obasanjo cannot hope to win re-election next year, he is seen by many Nigerians as having failed to provide leadership powerful enough to defeat the application of sharia. Obasanjo's federal minister of justice has written to the 12 states to tell them that sharia is illegal and that the constitution of Nigeria makes the country secular. But they have so far ignored him. Obasanjo's statements on the subject have been treated with equal disdain. Problems arise because, although sharia is supposed to govern only the lives of Muslims in the states, it affects Christians and followers of Nigerian indigenous religions as well. Some sharia states forbid men and women to use the same public transport. If a Christian and his wife living in the north travel by bus they must go separately. Christians regard this as an imposition, but they can do nothing about it. Drinking alcohol in hotels and restaurants is also frowned upon in sharia states. In Zamfara the governor, Ahmed Sani, paid unmarried women $250 each from state funds to prevent them from resorting to prostitution. Women are no longer allowed to play football, and girls and boys have been segregated into single-sex schools. Sharia makes some Nigerians more free than others. The law states that a federal court has to confirm a sentence of death, but in the north such cases are routinely referred to the lowest sharia courts, which do not hesitate to impose the death penalty. This is what happened to Amina Lawal, 30. She was sentenced to be stoned to death by a sharia court in March at Bakori, in Katsina state, for having had a baby outside marriage. The sentence was due to be carried out once she had weaned her daughter. Her appeal to a higher sharia court at Funtua, also in Katsina, was dismissed in August. She has now lodged another appeal with the sharia court of appeal in Kaduna. If that fails, she can go to the federal court of appeal and then to the supreme court. In the unlikely event that both these courts will uphold her death sentence, she could still be reprieved by the president. When news of Amina's sentence broke, a campaign was launched on her behalf. This led to some Miss World contestants refusing to go to Nigeria and that attracted adverse publicity around the globe. The world was right to be concerned, for in January a man sentenced to death by a sharia court for murder was hanged in Kaduna prison. There was no appeal to the federal courts and the ministry of justice did not intervene. With no confirmation from the presidential office as to whether the execution was sanctioned, the possibility remains that it might have been carried out unlawfully. Safiya Husaini, a mother of five, was more fortunate - her sentence to death for adultery was quashed by a sharia court in Sokoto. But the sharia courts routinely sentence prisoners to amputation of limbs and flogging, although such punishments are in direct defiance of the Nigerian constitution, which forbids \"cruel and inhuman punishment\". Because of the government's failure to protect the human rights of its citizens in the north, rioting has increased there in the past two years. The worst fighting was in Kaduna in 2000 when some 3,000 people were killed as Christians and Muslims battled for over a week. Churches and mosques were torched, and hotels and restaurants razed. Since then there have been riots in almost every sharia state, sometimes with retaliatory riots in the south around Lagos and the eastern states of Nigeria. Religion alone is not enough to explain the brutal strength of these periodic conflagrations. Many in the south believe that the north has a political agenda and wishes to rule the entire country. They argue that when its political expectations are ignored, the north resorts to religious violence. Since the country's oil wealth - 90% of its revenue - is produced in the south, this makes for an uneasy relationship. Many southerners also feel that the arid north is taking advantage of the political situation in Nigeria created by the British. In the early 20th century Lord Lugard, on behalf of Britain, incorporated many ethnic groups into the modern state - and forcing people who distrust one another to live side by side has only made things more volatile. With a southerner, President Obasanjo, in power, southern resentment is currently muted. But if the riots were to make it impossible for a southerner to be elected, the situation could be dangerous. Northerners argue that without their assistance Obasanjo would not have been elected. They claim that he was rejected by his own \"native\" states in the southwest. The situation is finely balanced. Reason is in short supply and there is no sign that either side will listen to the other. For the sake of Nigeria's 120 million people, it is to be hoped that the events that caused the cancellation of the Miss World contest will concentrate minds on Nigeria's future. If that happens, then Miss World, surprisingly, will have done the country a favour.
