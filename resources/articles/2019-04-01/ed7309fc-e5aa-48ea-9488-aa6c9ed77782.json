Facebook recorded a $3bn legal expense \u201cin connection with the inquiry of the FTC into our platform and user data practices\u201d, the company said. The expenses result in a 51% year-over-year decline in net income, to just $2.4bn. Absent this one-time expense, the company noted, Facebook\u2019s earnings per share would have beaten analyst expectations, and its operating margin (22%) would have been 20 points higher. \u201cWe estimate that the range of loss in this matter is $3.0bn to $5.0bn,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe matter remains unresolved, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome.\u201d The FTC launched an investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practices in March 2018 in response to the Cambridge Analytica revelations. The inquiry has focused on whether the data practices that allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain Facebook user data violated the company\u2019s 2011 agreement with the FTC. Facebook and the FTC have reportedly been negotiating over the settlement, which will dwarf the prior largest penalty for a privacy lapse, a $22.5m fine against Google in 2012. Facebook\u2019s results were otherwise strong, with total revenue and monthly active users beating analyst expectations. Shares soared more than 9% in after hours trading. But the expectation of an FTC fine may portend future trouble, warned the eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson. \u201cThis is a significant development, and any settlement with the FTC may impact the ways advertisers can use the platform in the future,\u201d she said. The stock market\u2019s positive response to the results drew the immediate ire of the Democratic congressman David Cicilline, who chairs the House subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative law. \u201cLast month, I said that a fine in the low billions of dollars would amount to a slap on the wrist for Facebook,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cTonight, we learned that\u2019s how Wall Street sees it too \u2013 as a slap on the wrist. If the FTC won\u2019t act, Congress has to.\u201d On a conference call with investors, the CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, focused his remarks on the plan to build out a \u201cprivacy-focused\u201d encrypted messaging platform and his thinking about regulation and the \u201cimportant social issues facing the internet\u201d. The plan to stitch together the various messaging platforms in Facebook\u2019s \u201cfamily of apps\u201d was announced in March as a pivot to a \u201cprivacy-focused communications platform\u201d. Zuckerberg said that he anticipates the build-out of the new service to take \u201cfive years or longer\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to intentionally take a longer period of time than we might have in order to get safety right,\u201d he said. \u201cA few years ago we probably would have rolled this out and then dealt with issues later.\u201d Zuckerberg also expressed confidence that the company could \u201cstrengthen privacy without meaningfully impacting our business\u201d, though the chief financial officer, David Wehner, warned that the company expects revenue growth rates to \u201cdecelerate sequentially\u201d due to \u201cad targeting-related headwinds\u201d. Those \u201cheadwinds\u201d include increasing numbers of people taking advantage of Europe\u2019s privacy regulation by opting out of ad targeting and Facebook\u2019s long-promised \u201cclear history\u201d tool, which Wehner said would launch in the fall. Zuckerberg\u2019s reference to \u201cissues facing the internet\u201d echoes the CEO\u2019s messaging from last quarter, when he began characterizing Facebook\u2019s numerous scandals as being challenges for the entire internet, and not just his company. Facebook was dogged during the quarter by another string of revelations of improper data practices, the departure of a key executive, intensifying scrutiny by regulators and lawmakers in the US and UK, and international outrage over the company\u2019s role in broadcasting and disseminating video of the terrorist shooting in Christchurch that killed 50 Muslims worshippers. The quarter also saw Facebook face criticism over rampant anti-vaccine misinformation, a questionable market research app, continuing struggles with its factchecking program, and a belated decision to stop allowing white nationalism. Facebook needs to show that it\u2019s improving on user data practices and content management, said Jessica Liu, a marketing analyst for Forrester. \u201cIts track record has been atrocious,\u201d Liu said of Facebook\u2019s data handling. \u201cNo more platitudes. What action is Facebook Inc actually taking?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
