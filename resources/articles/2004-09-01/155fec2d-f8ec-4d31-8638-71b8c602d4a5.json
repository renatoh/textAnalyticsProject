I have to remember he's only 18.\" In the end it proved impossible. Even Ferguson, as a former striker himself, could hardly suppress his exhilaration at what he had just seen: Wayne Rooney becoming the first United player to score a hat-trick on his debut in 99 years, one Charlie Sagar doing it to Bristol City in 1905. \"I've never seen a debut like that before,\" the manager acknowledged. \"He was magnificent. Everyone can see the potential the boy has, and you can't help but be excited by it. \"I think he can only get stronger too. But it was more than just the goals. As a partnership, he and Ruud van Nistelrooy were magnificent together. Considering it was the first time they have played together, it holds great promise for us.\" But Ferguson conceded that he might face an impossible task in quelling what he dismissively dubbed a \"media circus\". \"There's nothing I can do to stop it. It was a great start for him and that's why we signed him. The important thing, as his coach, is to allow him to develop naturally without too much press and public attention. \"We want him to lead as normal a life as possible.\" The only downside for Ferguson was the way the Turks made his defenders look vulnerable in the second half. \"I think you have give credit to the quality of their service into the box. It was brilliant. Not only that, on the second ball they got every shot on target. They were extremely good in that sense.\" Oh yes, and Ferguson revealed that the decision to start Rooney had been taken a full week earlier - but naturally he hadn't wanted to talk about that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
