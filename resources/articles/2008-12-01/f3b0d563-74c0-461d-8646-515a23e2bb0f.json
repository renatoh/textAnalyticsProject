Ince attended a scheduled board meeting at Ewood Park when the team's fall into the relegation zone and his connected job prospects were high on the agenda. Though he left the stadium without comment on his position, Ince is believed to have been told that he still has Williams' support but was also warned that results must improve immediately. It seems certain the 41-year-old will remain at the helm for Blackburn's trip to Wigan Athletic on Saturday although defeat at the JJB Stadium may prompt another boardroom assessment of the manager's ability to keep the club in the Premier League. Having taken the bold choice to promote Ince from League One and MK Dons in the summer, in preference to more experienced candidates, Williams is desperate to give the manager time to prove himself after just 16 Premier League games in charge. But there is also opposition within the Blackburn boardroom to the chairman's stance, understood to come from the trustees of the Jack Walker fund, the club's owners who are anxious to sell an asset that will plummet in value should Rovers suffer relegation. Blackburn have gone 10 league games without a win but now face a more inviting run of games that could determine the team's and the manager's chances of survival. Following Wigan, Rovers face Stoke, Sunderland, Manchester City, Fulham, Newcastle, Bolton and Middlesbrough before the end of January, and Williams would prefer to assess Ince then. The Rovers' chairman has set the team a target of nine wins to ensure Premier League survival, a tally that would take Blackburn to 40 points, but admits the recovery has to commence swiftly. \"We have 22 games left and the sooner we start picking up the wins the better the situation will look,\" Williams said. \"The longer we go without a win the more difficult it becomes for us to get those wins we need. The players and the manager believe our fortunes will change once we get that first win, but we all know we need that win quickly.\" With only a minimal transfer budget available for January, another topic that was up for discussion yesterday and a bleak reality that may deter prospective candidates should Ince depart, Williams insists it is imperative the former England captain is given time to make his mark. \"If you give Paul time, then you can make a judgment on him, but you can't judge somebody after 16 games. It almost seems now we are very judgmental within a few games, it's absolutely crazy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
