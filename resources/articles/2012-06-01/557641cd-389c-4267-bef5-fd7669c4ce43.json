In a major boost to Vince Cable, who is expected to kill off the idea proposed by the Tory donor Adrian Beecroft, the EEF manufacturing organisation calls on ministers to focus on other areas of employment reform. The EEF, whose annual dinner was addressed by the chancellor, George Osborne, in March, turns on the so-called \"no-fault dismissal\" proposal in a formal submission to the government. Cable agreed to hold a formal six-month \"call for evidence\", which ends this Friday, into whether the Beecroft proposal should be introduced for small companies employing fewer than 10 people. The move by Cable was a compromise between the coalition partners after the Lib Dems warned that the most controversial proposal in a report by Beecroft would have a \"chilling effect\" on the labour market. Steve Hilton, the prime minister's long-standing policy guru, regarded the idea as an important way to help promote economic growth. Terry Scuoler, the EEF chief executive, offers support for Cable in his submission to the business department. Scuoler says: \"The government is right to focus on making our labour market more flexible, but the case for no-fault dismissal is far from proven. We've found little support from industry for introducing no-fault dismissal, its benefits look pretty limited and we've seen no evidence that it would increase recruitment. \"The government now needs to take a hard look at whether the claims for its benefits are real and at the risk of damaging employment relations.\" The manufacturers call on the government to focus on some of the less controversial ideas in the Beecroft report as it sets out a five-point plan for employment reform: \u2022 Accelerate plans to reduce the 90-day consultation period for collective redundancy to 30 days. \u2022 Streamline employment tribunals by making greater use of conciliation and requiring claimants to lodge fees ahead of making a claim. \u2022 Simplify the Tupe rules, which protect workers' pay and jobs when a new company takes over a service contract. The EEF wants to allow employers to \"harmonise terms and conditions of employees a year after the transfer of the business has taken place\". \u2022 Help employers manage relations with employees more effectively by introducing \"protected conversations\" which allow the two sides to \"discuss performance issues with employees without triggering legal action\". \u2022 Ensure that plans for shared parental leave are simple to operate. Scuoler adds: \"We are concerned that the controversy over no-fault dismissal is distracting attention from the issues that really matter to business. The government has many good ideas on collective redundancy, employment tribunals, Tupe and compromise agreements and it now needs to get on with implementing them before moving any further on no-fault dismissal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
