It is kick and flap in the case of England who, for the third successive match this Six Nations, played 20 minutes with 14 men after having two players sent to the sin bin. Ireland had to do little to win and maintain their grand slam quest \u2013 61 years after their first, and only, clean sweep \u2013 and the outcome was a tedious stalemate in which neither side were prepared to take the initiative. The Lions' head coach, Ian McGeechan, left the ground wearing a forlorn expression. Having seen Wales exposed in Paris the previous evening, Scotland's laboured victory over Italy was followed by an 80 minutes so turgid and so devoid of inspiration, wit and imagination that South Africa would appear to have little to fear ahead of the tourists' visit this summer. England are moulding themselves into an obdurate, stubborn side who are hard to beat after three heavy defeats against the Sanzar nations last November. Ireland responded by eliminating risk from their game and playing for territory, waiting for the visitors to concede penalties. It worked as a tactic up to the point that Ronan O'Gara stepped up to kick for goal: the outside-half started the day needing nine points to break the record in the championship, but he fluffed two kickable chances from virtually the same position in the opening 22 minutes and the home side established a grip only when England found themselves a man down. England went into the game having received eight yellow cards in their previous three Tests. While they had publicly complained that referees were treating them with a disproportionate severity, their team manager, Martin Johnson, had spent the week emphasising to his players that their defence were strong and organised enough to render redundant the need to kill opposition ball. Johnson may as well have jabbered away in Esperanto. Within 10 minutes of the start, the referee, Craig Joubert, was wagging an admonitory finger after a bone-headed piece of interference at a ruck by a player in white. The culprit was the prop, Phil Vickery, one of the side's most experienced players; he, along with another senior figure, Mike Tindall, was responsible for a hefty bite of the 16 penalties England gave away. It was when Vickery was sent to the sin bin on the hour that Ireland scored their try. They took a scrum instead of a kick at goal and, after four drives had been held up on the line, the Ireland captain, Brian O'Driscoll, spotted a slither of space between the replacement prop, Julian White, and Nick Kennedy on the line, to pick up and dab down for a score that summed up the attacking poverty of a game that both sides made it a priority not to lose. Johnson sat in the media conference afterwards with an expression that could not have been more uncomfortable had he just had a tooth pulled. A side who had become far less porous than last autumn, attributable partly to an improved defence but also to less resourceful opponents, undermined their own resilience by supplying Ireland with the means to score points and play for position. \"We should be trusting our defence and believing ourselves,\" Johnson said. \"We have to make changes, not necessarily in terms of people.\" The replacement scrum-half, Danny Care, will be fortunate to remain in the 22 for the game against France in the last round. His shove off the ball on Marcus Horan at a ruck three minutes from normal time, after England had fought back to 11-6, allowed Ireland to take a cushion of eight points into stoppage time. Delon Armitage's try, which came after Andy Goode's off-load and Tindall's break, was merely a hint of what could have been. Armitage was fortunate not to see yellow after taking out O'Driscoll off the ball, moments after Riki Flutey had got away with a crude challenge on the Ireland captain, an act that left the Lion needing prolonged treatment and which will interest the citing commissioner. England gave away twice as many penalties as their hosts and that, on a night devoid of expression, was always going to be fatal. It was a game to make a highlights editor consider a new career. Thirty minutes elapsed before the first points were scored, O'Gara succeeding with his third penalty attempt. England had started by running the ball from near their own 25, but, as in November, they went for width without creating space and, after being caught a few times behind the gain line, indulged in a kicking exchange with Ireland that left the crowd, who had greeted the playing of the Irish anthems with a roar that would have been heard beyond Lansdowne Road, almost mute. Two box kicks by the scrum-half Tom\u00e1s O'Leary, both sent in the opposite direction to the way the England defence were drifting, were as enterprising as it got. England's attacks were sporadic, largely because of the increasing number of penalties they conceded, and neither side created space behind. Nothing of note happened for long periods, but England went into the interval level at 3-3 after Toby Flood kicked a penalty under the posts following a Nick Kennedy line-out steal. The second period was, if anything, even less inspired. England continued to concede penalties, dull and duller. O'Gara missed his third attempt before O'Driscoll, seeing that the referee was playing advantage after yet another breakdown infringement, dropped his fifth international goal in Test rugby. Vickery's dispatch to the sin bin immediately resulted in O'Driscoll's try, but Armitage reduced the arrears to five points with a 40-yard penalty he took because Flood was hobbling. Ireland, for the first time, looked uncertain. O'Driscoll had a hack at a drop goal before Care, who had not long been on the field, conceded victory with a rashness that has undermined his game too often this season. Ireland march towards the grand slam, England continue to look inwards while McGeechan can only pray that the final two rounds of the Six Nations offer him something in the way of inspiration with only the Irish, against France in the opening round, offering him any sort of succour so far. That day seems so long ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
