The former prime minister made the call in an opinion piece published in the Spectator Magazine on Monday. Australia gives more than $40m a year in aid to Palestine, provided through United Nations agencies and some charitable organisations. The money goes towards projects to provide Palestinian refugees with basic services such as health, education, water and sanitation. Last year, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade suspended aid to World Vision\u2019s work in the Palestinian territories in the wake of allegations the charity\u2019s head in Gaza funnelled millions of dollars to militant group Hamas. The organisation has denied the claims, which are subject to court proceedings in Israel. Abbott also said Australia could demonstrate \u201cunswerving support for Israel\u201d by joining any move by the incoming Trump administration to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Most governments have kept their embassy out of Jerusalem because they do not recognise Israel\u2019s occupation of east Jerusalem since 1967. Noting that Israel\u2019s GDP per person was about $40,000 a year, compared with Palestine\u2019s of about $2,000, Abbott blamed the economic problems of the territories on \u201ca focus on politics over economics and the all-pervading sense of grievance\u201d among Palestinians. Last week the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, strongly indicated that Australia would not have supported a UN resolution \u2013 co-sponsored by New Zealand \u2013 criticising Israel\u2019s settlements policy in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The Israeli government reacted furiously when the US abstained on the resolution. The acting opposition leader, Chris Bowen, said Australian assistance to Gaza and the West Bank was vital to counter extremism and promote peace in the Middle East. \u201cMr Abbott is clearly using this as yet another issue to undermine Malcolm Turnbull and continue his campaign to regain the leadership by appealing to the hardliners in the Liberal party,\u201d Bowen said. Australia\u2019s aid program must be transparent and accountable and must reach those it was intended to benefit, he said. Abbott recently returned from a trip to the Middle East, including Israel. He attended the Australia-Israel-UK Dialogue in Jerusalem with opposition leader Bill Shorten and other federal MPs. In his article Abbott also noted that at the dialogue Professor Nir Shaviv of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem \u201cmethodically debunked the climate change theories peddled by the UN Panel\u201d. If he was right, Abbott wrote, \u201ccountries like ours have been inflicting pointless economic pain upon themselves\u2019."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
