I'm applying for a number of jobs at the moment as I try to pursue a change of career. I have two line managers who have graciously agreed to act as referees for me. The usual procedure for references seems to be \"Is it OK to contact referees before interview?\" and job offers are made \"subject to references\". All perfectly sensible. However, I have completed two application forms recently \u2014 one for a government agency, the other for a local further education college \u2014 which have baldly stated that \"references may be taken up prior to an interview\" without giving me any say in the matter. I object to this and feel strongly that my referees should only be approached in the event of an offer of employment being made. What a waste of time or an employer to ask for 16 referees if they have eight candidates to interview instead of just two for the person they decide to appoint. I also believe that interviews are not just a chance for a potential employer to find out more about me but for me to find out whether I would like to work for them. If my referees were approached each time I had an interview, they could end up having to fill out a lot of forms. Am I over-reacting to this? Is there any point in my asking (diplomatically!) for referees to be contacted only in the event of an offer of employment? Or is that simply a way of ensuring that my application hits the rejects' pile without anyone even looking at my skills or experience? You do seem to have built up quite a head of steam about this. Has something else got under your skin recently? There's a strong undercurrent of \"And another thing!\" about your letter. Capital letters even. Michael Winner might have some advice for you. It seems to me extremely improbable that either of these potential employers would write off to the referees of every candidate before inviting them for interview. They're just establishing their freedom to do so. Overly bureaucratic, perhaps, and not very sensitive; but no cause for outrage, surely? There may well be the occasional application that, though extremely promising in almost every respect, leaves room for some specific doubt. It seems to me entirely reasonable for a reference to be checked before an interview is granted; it could save both parties time and trouble. So however diplomatically you do it, I'd strongly advise against insisting on being released from this condition. At worst you could sound as if you'd something to hide and at best you'd come across as petty-minded. I agree with you that interviews should have a mutual value; it's at least as important for the potential employee to evaluate the potential employer as the other way found. But unless you feel your references will be unflattering \u2014 which you clearly don't \u2014 then tacitly agreeing to this mildly irritating request isn't going to do you out of anything. I'm new to the UK but have struggled to find a teaching job I have recently settled in the UK with my wife and daughter (who are both British). While overseas I completed my degree in physical education and sport. After graduating I found myself working as a project manager for an after-school programme for underprivileged children. Though very difficult at times, it was also very rewarding and it made me feel like I was doing something meaningful. I studied physical education because I am passionate about sports. Ideally I would like to be part of a sports organisation but I am not sure in what capacity. I just know I am sports-obsessed. But my problem goes beyond that. Now, in England, I have applied for many jobs that were related to sports but have not been given any interviews. I then decided \u2014 reluctantly \u2014 to go to education agencies since I thought that as a qualified teacher I will be able to find something. But this too has proven hard to get. My certificates are all translated into English but they are perplexing to potential recruiters. I am now looking to work at anything since we are beginning to struggle financially. But even simple jobs, like warehouse positions, now require reference checks and police checks \u2014 which is reasonable but takes a long time, and many companies prefer not to go through the hassle of doing overseas checks. I'm worried that I have gotten to the point where I have to work at anything, but at the same time I wonder if I will be able to get out of that cycle of working at odd jobs since these kind of jobs will not contribute to my desire to do something meaningful. Though fluent in English, it is still not my first language and I feel like I don't know how to convey what I did back home to potential recruiters. The one thing you fail to mention could be the one thing you should be concentrating on: and that's your first language. Perverse though it may seem, the background that may be working against you in 99 out of 100 job opportunities could make you extremely desirable for the remaining one. And you only need one. Because I don't know the name of your native country, I don't know the size of its community in Britain. But if you haven't already done so, you need to plug into it immediately. For someone in your situation, being a member of an informal network can be hugely helpful \u2014 not just in coming up with possible job opportunities but just as importantly as a source of moral support and encouragement. It's clear that your confidence is fading fast \u2014 and the company of sympathetic compatriots could help a lot. Somewhere out there will be a job \u2014 and a challenging and rewarding job at that \u2014 where your native language will be seen as a rare and positive asset. No one will be daunted by those translated certificates. It's probably too much to hope that such a job will also involve sport \u2014 but you may have to postpone that dream for a bit. Once you've had one good job under your belt in this country, finding the next will be a great deal easier. For Jeremy Bullmore's advice on a work issue, send a brief email to work@theguardian.com.
