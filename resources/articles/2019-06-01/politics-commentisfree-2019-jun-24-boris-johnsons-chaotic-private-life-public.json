We are expected to call them Boris and Carrie, as though they are people we might know or even like. How much can we be played? All that plays in my head is Grace Jones snarling Chrissie Hynde\u2019s superb lines: \u201cYour sentimental gestures only bore me to death / You\u2019ve made a desperate appeal now save your breath / Attachment to obligation through guilt and regret / Shit that\u2019s so wet. Your private life drama, baby leave me out.\u201d When it comes to our politicians, what should be public and what off-limits? This time the snoopers seem to have been invited in. The last lot of snoopers, who alerted the police to a late-night row, were obviously part of the provisional wing of the Camberwell bourgeoisie. Are people who worry about their neighbours dangerous \u2013 even if it turns out their fears are unfounded? Who would intervene if they suspected a potential \u201cdomestic\u201d? Well me, for one. Johnson has lived his life the way he has wanted to and if it was in open and consensual relationships, that\u2019s cool. But not much in Johnson\u2019s life is very open right now and I don\u2019t need to rehearse his history here. Others who know him much better than I do have done that. I just don\u2019t forget the time I was with one of his exes, who had twice been pregnant by him, and he ignored her in public (someone more important was there). Nonetheless, this is a private matter. We can go too far perhaps in expecting politicians to be paragons of virtue. What next, \u201cmandatory urine tests\u201d, as Christopher Hitchens once suggested? Perish the thought. We could always be more French about politicians\u2019 private lives. Jacques Chirac and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand both had mistresses. We could be merely resigned, as Hillary Clinton was when she said of her husband: \u201cHe is a hard dog to keep on the porch.\u201d Women who were considered trash were thrown under a bus. We could say that nothing that happens outside a parliamentary setting is anyone\u2019s goddamned business, and just accept the protection this attitude affords powerful men. If the Tory wannabe PMs had not paraded evidence of their heterosexuality \u2013 as if their wives were simply stylish food processors in catalogue kitchens \u2013 none of their personal lives would matter. Indeed, Tory \u201cmorality\u201d was once clearer on this. Under Margaret Thatcher a man \u2013 Cecil Parkinson \u2013 might have lost his job after impregnating his secretary, but what came across most strongly was the Tories\u2019 imperious attitude towards single mothers. The real issue is not the chaos of Johnson\u2019s private life but its parallels with the chaos of his public pronouncements, his seeming abandonment of the need to debate, have policies or tell the truth. How can it be that he is afraid of that permanently startled-looking middle manager Jeremy Hunt? Still, Johnson seems to think he will get what he wants, because he wants it. This toddler-like emotional development, applauded as self-belief, masquerades now as rapacious masculinity or strong and stable male genius. Does it actually matter how men treat women in their personal lives? You know what, it does. Hunt floats limiting abortion, Johnson betrays as he breathes. His obsequious lieutenants boast of his charisma, but are unable to answer the simple question of how many children he has. Meanwhile, he shifts in his chair. I don\u2019t get to vote for him; I\u2019m not a Tory member. And I don\u2019t think infidelity is a crime. But rolling back the rights of women is. The separation between private and public is dubious. This man-baby is not fit to lead this country. He trashes everything he touches, from sofas to budgets, but he will have his day. And so will all these dissolute cowards who blabber on about wars and traditions they disrespect daily. Your public life dramas \u2013 baby leave me out. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
