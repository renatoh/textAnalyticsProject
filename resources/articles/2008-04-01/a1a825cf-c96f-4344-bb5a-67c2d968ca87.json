Desperate for the season to end, they found themselves up against an Arsenal side who, freed of the pressure of competing for the title, indulged themselves in exploring what Ars\u00e8ne Wenger described afterwards as their vision of how the game should be played. The result was humiliation for the Rams on a scale which could scarcely be believed. It should have been double figures. For 25 minutes Derby at least competed, or more accurately hung on to Arsenal's coat-tails. Thereafter, despite scoring twice, they barely had a kick. Never can a technical and aesthetic gulf have yawned so widely between teams nominally in the same division. \"We have shown we enjoy the game we play,\" said Wenger. \"For me this team has a good future. We have 77 points now and have lost just three games. The team has grown; we are stronger than at the start of the season. When we were under pressure in March you could see we did not have the experience to be there, but we learned a lot.\" Will they cope with that pressure next season? \"Of course. Our performances during that time were not bad but decisions and injuries went against us. Some seasons they go for you.\" If there was a lack of edge about the opening exchanges which suggested an upset might be on the cards, Nicklas Bendtner's opener, the Dane taking advantage of a pathetic mix-up between Robbie Savage and Darren Moore to exchange passes with Robin van Persie and shoot past Roy Carroll, put paid to such a fanciful notion. Somehow Van Persie missed the target after Theo Walcott had left him with only Carroll to beat a minute later and, incredibly, Derby equalised. Savage swung in a free-kick and the ball fell for Jay McEveley to prod past Lukasz Fabianski, making his Premiership debut for Wenger's team. But the natural order was quickly restored. Kolo Tour\u00e9 hit a fine diagonal ball to Van Persie, waiting in the penalty area after beating a shambles of an offside trap. The Dutchman controlled the ball on his chest and smashed a right-foot volley past Carroll. The second half was a rout. Tour\u00e9 twice went close and one Cesc F\u00e1bregas back-heel had even the Derby supporters applauding. After a three-minute period during which Derby touched the ball once, Walcott humiliated Alan Stubbs inside the penalty area and cut the ball back. Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 misconnected but Emmanuel Adebayor touched the ball home. Walcott, played clear by Bendtner, should have made it four almost straight away but failed to finish. Rob Earnshaw, played through by Andy Todd, reminded him how to do it and the Arsenal forward responded with a brilliant curler. Adebayor's late double, the first of which appeared to be offside, took the Togolese to 30 for the season, an achievement Wenger admitted he had not anticipated. But then, as he pointed out, if you play up front for this team you should score goals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
