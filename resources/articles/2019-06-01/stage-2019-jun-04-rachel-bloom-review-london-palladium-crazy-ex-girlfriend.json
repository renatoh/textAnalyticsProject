The Golden Globe-winning writer and star of Netflix\u2019s musical hit Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is in London to lead a feral night of comedy and song that is ironic, playful, sexy, thoughtful, childish and stupidly clever. Whether you\u2019re a diehard fan of the frank feminist series or have never seen an episode, Bloom and her band\u2019s outrageous joy is contagious. When you think the adrenaline has peaked, they just raise the bar higher. Unpretentious, illogical and beautifully lit, this violently funny evening expresses the high of good sex and the joy of sharing life\u2019s crap with friends. But there\u2019s nothing twee here: as in the TV series the songs originate from, Bloom elegantly lays out brutal modern truths in the coffin of romcom cliches. Then, she dry-humps the coffin. The band throw out one showstopper after another, from the sweetly crude Oh My God I Think I Like You to the sado-masochistic Feeling Kinda Naughty. The arrival of co-stars Pete Gardner and Scott Michael Foster nearly brings the house down, and with Emmy-award winning choreographer Kathryn Burns, the four goof around, sing about sexy maths and the legitimacy of bisexuality, and tap-dance to We Tapped That Ass. It\u2019s all at once throwaway and deeply probing into the complexities of relationships. Song co-writer Adam Schlesinger \u2013 former Fountains of Wayne band member \u2013 is on keys, leading Ethan Eubanks and Greig Robinson in the rhythm section. It\u2019s pointless trying to pick their best song: I would like them all on repeat please. Bloom herself is exhilarating. Between offbeat songs about period sex (\u201cIf you\u2019re grossed out just pretend it\u2019s cherry lube\u201d) and taking the moral high ground (\u201cDoctors Without Borders don\u2019t have nothing on me\u201d) she talks about masturbating with an electric toothbrush and the stigma of mental illness. If you didn\u2019t go in as a fan, you\u2019ll leave hooked. I had never seen the TV show and I really didn\u2019t need another series to catch up on but this team is titanic. I\u2019m already having withdrawal symptoms. God, Bloom, you ruined everything."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
