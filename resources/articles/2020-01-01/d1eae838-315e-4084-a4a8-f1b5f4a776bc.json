A quartet of senators \u2013 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2013 escorted the US supreme court\u2019s chief justice, John Roberts, dressed in a long black robe, into the chamber. So began the Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Chuck Grassley, the Senate\u2019s president pro tempore (for the time being), instructed Roberts, who will preside over the trial, to raise his right hand and place his left hand on the Bible to be sworn in. \u201cDo you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws: so help you God?\u201d Grassley said, reading from an antiquated script. Roberts swore that he would. He then turned to administer the same oath to every senator in the chamber. Owing to one absence, 99 right hands rose in the air. When Roberts finished, the senators responded in unison: \u201cI do.\u201d A new age of political tribalism and partisan warfare will test the resonance \u2013 and relevance \u2013 of that 232-year-old pledge that set in motion the next phase of a deeply divisive effort to remove the president from office during a presidential election year. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, vowed to overcome the cynicism and bitterness that has seeped into every aspect of American political life, gravely compromising the Senate\u2019s longstanding claim to be the \u201cgreatest deliberative body in the world\u201d. \u201cThis chamber exists precisely so that we can look past daily dramas and understand how our actions will reverberate for generations,\u201d he said, before the ceremonial swearing-in. \u201cSo that we can put aside animal reflexes and animosities, and coolly consider how to best serve our country.\u201d But few of the president\u2019s adversaries will find comfort in McConnell\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019m not impartial about this at all,\u201d the majority leader declared last month, arguing that impeachment is an inherently political process. As such, he had worked in \u201ctotal coordination\u201d with the White House over impeachment, he said, an approach that has made even some Republican senators uncomfortable. The comments ignited a firestorm. Democrats said it was proof that for McConnell and the entire Republican caucus, the oath they swore would be nothing more than empty words. Republicans wondered how the Democrats could claim impartiality after three years of denouncing the president and his policies, not to mention that four senators who took the oath are running to replace him in November. \u201c.@SenSanders, @SenWarren, @SenAmyKlobuchar, and @SenatorBennet are spending millions of dollars to defeat @realDonaldTrump, and we\u2019re supposed to believe they will be impartial during the trial?\u201d Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, wrote in a tweet shared by the president. \u201cThey should recuse themselves.\u201d The senators \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet \u2013 have all said they believe the evidence is strong enough to convict the president and remove him from office. Before she quit the presidential race, Senator Kamala Harris of California was asked about her support for removing Trump from office. Was that fair to the president? \u201cIt\u2019s just being observant,\u201d said Harris, a former California attorney general. \u201cBecause he has committed crimes in plain sight.\u201d Likewise, the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham has said he would \u201cdo everything I can\u201d to make impeachment \u201cdie quickly\u201d. \u201cI am trying to give a pretty clear signal I have made up my mind,\u201d he said during an interview with CNN at the Doha Forum in Qatar last month. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to reach a verdict and the verdict is going to be acquittal,\u201d the Texas senator Ted Cruz said in an interview on Fox News. \u201cThe verdict is going to be not guilty.\u201d Fairness, it would seem, is in the eye of the beholder. There remains a flicker of hope that at least one critical element of the trial might be bipartisan: the thorny decision of whether to summon new witnesses and documents. For weeks, the chambers were at an impasse over precisely how and when to proceed to the trial stage of the impeachment inquiry. After a month-long delay, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, relented and on Wednesday the chamber voted to send two articles of impeachment to the Senate. \u201cTime,\u201d she declared, \u201chas been our friend.\u201d As the House signed and delivered articles, new details were emerging about Trump\u2019s alleged effort to extract a political favor from Ukraine, which is at the heart of his impeachment trial. Troves of documents and interviews from Lev Parnas, an associate of the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, offered fresh insight into the alleged pressure campaign and Trump\u2019s involvement. And just hours before proceedings got under way on Thursday, a non-partisan federal watchdog agency concluded that the Trump administration had violated the law by withholding congressionally approved military assistance to Ukraine, another matter at the heart of the case against the president. Democrats said the report strengthened their argument to allow new documents and evidence during the Senate trial. A small but influential contingent of Republican senators have said they would like to hear from witnesses, particularly John Bolton, the former White House national security adviser who was present for many key episodes covered by the House\u2019s inquiry. Democrats only need four Republicans to force a vote on whether to subpoena a witness. But their effort to \u201cdo impartial justice\u201d faces a new obstacle. The Kentucky senator Rand Paul has vowed political retribution for displays of disloyalty. If any Republican lawmaker helped Democrats call a witness they hoped to hear from, Paul said he would force a retaliatory vote on a controversial witness the senators hoped to avoid. At the top of the list is Hunter Biden, son of the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company and is at the center of a corruption conspiracy theory promoted by Republicans, and the whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment inquiry. \u201cIf you vote against Hunter Biden, you\u2019re voting to lose your election, basically,\u201d Paul told Politico this week. Opening the door to witnesses could disrupt McConnell\u2019s carefully laid plans for the Senate trial that he intended to have \u201conly one outcome\u201d. \u201cThe weight of history sits on [our] shoulders,\u201d Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said after the swearing-in ceremony concluded, \u201cand produces, sometimes, results you never know will happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
