The remarks by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) aerospace commander Brig Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, who is in charge of missile forces, marked a much more aggressive tone that the official line pursued by Iran\u2019s foreign ministry. The country\u2019s diplomats have insisted that the missile strikes on two bases \u201cconcluded\u201d the Iranian response to the US drone strike killing of top IRGC general, Qassem Suleimani. Hajizadeh suggested they were just the start. \u201cThe missile strikes on one of the United States\u2019 most important bases within the framework of Martyr Suleimani operation were the start of big operations which will continue in the entire region,\u201d the general told reporters in Tehran on Thursday. Hajizadeh gave the press conference in front of the flags of Iran-aligned militia groups including those of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, Iraq\u2019s Popular Mobilisation Forces and Yemen\u2019s Houthis, an unusual piece of symbolism of Iran\u2019s reach through regional networks \u2013 networks that Suleimani had established as the head of the Quds force, the elite external wing of the IRGC. Hajizadeh claimed the ballistic missile strikes on the al-Asad and Erbil bases, both Iraqi facilities hosting a US presence, were aimed at damaging the American \u201cmilitary machine\u201d and not inflicting US casualties, though he repeated apparently false Iranian claims that some Americans had been killed. \u201cIf we were looking to kill, we could have designed the operation in a way such that 500 [Americans] would be killed in the first step, and if they had responded, a further 4,000 to 5,000 would be killed in the next steps within 48 hours,\u201d he claimed. According to Jeffrey Lewis, at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, which published satellite images of the missile damage, it was a carefully calibrated attack. \u201cIt was meant to be a proportional legalistic response aimed at a military target,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were trying to avoid casualties. They saw it as a legitimate target, without worrying whether they killed American service personnel.\u201d He added that the Iranians used ballistic missiles, rather than cruise missiles, \u201cbecause they wanted it to be clear where the missiles came from\u201d. In Washington, the House of Representatives passed a war powers resolution, demanding that the administration halt any further US military action against Iran, beyond self-defence, without congressional approval. However, the resolution is non-binding and it looked unlikely that Democrats had won over enough Republicans to win a similar vote in the Senate. Efforts by senior officials to justify the killing of Suleimani in a closed-door congressional briefing on Wednesday backfired when members of Congress complained that the administration was not providing sufficient details about its claim that the drone strike prevented an imminent attack. The Republican senator Mike Lee called it the \u201cprobably the worst briefing I have seen, at least on a military issue, in the nine years I\u2019ve served in the United States Senate\u201d. Lee said the officials would not even answer a hypothetical question on whether the administration would need congressional authority to carry out an assassination of Iran\u2019s supreme leader. \u201cThe fact that there was nothing but a refusal to answer that question was perhaps the most deeply upsetting thing to me in that meeting,\u201d Lee told National Public Radio. In seeking to justify the Suleimani killing, Donald Trump made a new claim on Thursday about the Iranian general\u2019s plans to attack Americans in Iraq. \u201cWe caught a total monster, and we took him out,\u201d the president said. \u201cThey were looking to blow up our embassy.\u201d Asked for more details, Trump said \u201cI think it was obvious,\u201d adding that Suleimani \u201chad more than that particular embassy in mind\u201d. Trump expanded on his suggestion made in his televised address the previous day that Nato could play an expanded role in the Middle East, in place of US troops. On Thursday, he even suggested a name for such a force: Natome. \u201cIf you add the two words Middle East at the end of it,\u201d Trump said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t that work beautifully? It\u2019s Nato plus me. \u201cWe can come home, or largely come home and use Nato. This is an international problem,\u201d Trump said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he was open to the suggestion. \u201cWhat President Trump called for yesterday was more Nato involvement and we are looking into what more we can do,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not speculate about the outcome but I will say that I think Nato has the potential to do more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
