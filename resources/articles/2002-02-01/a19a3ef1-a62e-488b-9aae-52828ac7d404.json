As weary Welsh supporters faced more delays on their way back from Dublin, the vice-chairman of the WRU, Les Williams, said it was time for the New Zealander to quit his \u00a3235,000-a-year post for the sake of the long-suffering fans: the Wales squad had been advised not to get to Dublin airport yesterday any earlier than they had to for fear of angry travellers rounding on Henry and his players. The WRU's general committee will on Thursday discuss the 54-10 thrashing by Ireland, the third consecutive year that Wales have opened their championship campaign with a record reverse, and Henry's position is looking precarious even though it would cost the union, which is struggling financially, \u00a3400,000 to pay him off: a Welsh bookmaker was yesterday offering odds on his successor with the Wales A coach Mike Ruddock the favourite. \"Graham should do the honourable thing and resign,\" said Williams. \"To those who would ask whether we could afford to sack him, I would say that we cannot afford not to. The future of our game is at stake and he is clearly not getting through to the players. It was a mistake for him to coach the Lions last summer, as he was warned before he accepted that job, and he returned from Australia wounded and vulnerable.\" Henry is contracted until the end of next year's World Cup and after the Wales squad returned to Cardiff from Dublin yesterday he hinted that he was prepared to consider his future. \"I am comfortable with the way I and the national management team are going about our jobs,\" he said. \"If the decision of other people is that it is not good enough, then I will consider that, but I believe we can turn things around.\" Henry was hailed as a redeemer after his arrival in the summer of 1998 saw Wales turn from a laughing stock into a side which went on a 10-match winning streak with England, France (twice) and South Africa among their victims, but he became embroiled in the Grannygate scandal when the New Zealanders Shane Howarth and Brett Sinkinson were discovered to have played for Wales before eligible to do so in 2000 and little has gone right for him since with his side booed off the Millennium stadium after defeats to Ireland and Argentina last autumn. \"We have the best supporters in the world,\" said Williams. \"They travel away in greater numbers than fans from any other country but they are being short-changed. He goes on about the structure of our game, and I agree that the WRU needs to change the way it runs itself and the game, but Sunday had more to do with his coaching than structures. It was shocking and unacceptable.\" Henry had little support among former Wales internationals yesterday. \"Sunday was an abysmal shambles,\" said Gareth Davies. \"You have to blame the players for a start, but when you have a coach earning nearly \u00a3250,000 a year, there has to be some kind of responsibility.\" Another former Wales fly-half, David Watkins, agreed: \"We have a head coach, a team manager, a kicking guru and defence and forward experts and we still cannot get it right. It is up to the WRU and Henry himself whether the coach is to go, but to a lot of people it is clear-cut. If my results in business were as bad as Wales's, I would no longer have a job.\" Gwyn Jones, the Wales captain in 1997 until a neck injury forced him to retire from the game, said that getting rid of Henry would not solve the real problem. \"You can put some blame on Henry and his players, but the reasons for Sunday are more profound. We have to look at the way the game here is organised and decisions have to be made in the next couple of months so that we end our infighting and plan for the future. Questions are asked about whether Italy are worth a place in the Six Nations, but any more defeats like Dublin and people will be saying the same about Wales.\" A year ago, after Wales had lost 44-15 to England, Henry recommended a shake-up of his coaching team: a defence coach and a forwards' coach, jointly employed at an annual cost of \u00a3225,000, have since been hired along with an Australian strategist. The union's wage bill for the management team is around \u00a3800,000 a year. When the WRU was building the Millennium stadium, it had a business plan drawn up by a consultant. So far, the facility is realising only 40% of its estimated revenue and not one penny of the \u00a360m loan taken out to help rebuild it has been paid off while the annual interest repayments are \u00a33m. More than 10,000 tickets for next month's international against Italy remain unsold, one reason, said Williams, why the union could not afford to continue to employ Henry as anger turns to apathy. Blowing the whistle on Henry Graham should do the honourable thing and resign. Les Williams vice-chariman RFU If my results in business were as bad as Henry's with Wales, I would be out of a job. David Watkins Henry and his coaching colleagues should ask themselves what was their role in helping to produce such a dreadful performance. John Dawes Henry is accountable and his job is on the line. Gareth Davies You cannot defend that performance. It was shambling. We were very poor. Jonathan Davies I think we need to adopt a game plan which is more Welsh, one where players are asked to be direct. Rare is the coach who has the inspirational effect in his fourth year that he had in his first. Scott Gibbs \u00b7 Now have your say.
