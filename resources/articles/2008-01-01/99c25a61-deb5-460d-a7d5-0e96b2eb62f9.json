What was once an even green sward has been cratered with large patches of lead-coloured rain water. It's more than coincidence that the words plover and the Latin for rain (pluvia) are similar. The birds were long said to be reliable predictors of wet weather, and with the latest downpours have come several thousand lapwings and golden plovers to the Yare valley. \"Goldies\" are famous for their nervousness and their panic-edged flights are known as \"dreads\". From my office I've been able to watch these sweeping chaotic movements across a window of sky, sub-groups crisscrossing the same air space in a constantly changing and mesmerising pattern. On the moors of Derbyshire, breeding goldies produce a sweet mournful but distinct whistle, yet over the winter fields of Norfolk it has acquired a different resonance. It seems somehow faded and softer - rather like rain itself - and old, even ancient. Each day I go out to the marsh and simply stand, gazing upwards and luxuriating in this beautiful, gossamered sound. In flight an individual golden plover has a shape midway between two very different birds. They can have the rounded breast and softness of a dove, but when they accelerate, the wings acquire a winnowing, almost lashing action, and they have the agility and speed of a falcon. Quite how fast goldies fly was once a matter of significant dispute. An aristocratic shooting party in Ireland argued the relative velocity of grouse and golden plover in flight. One of the disputants was the then manager of Guinness brewery. From this chance discussion the famous book of world records was born."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
