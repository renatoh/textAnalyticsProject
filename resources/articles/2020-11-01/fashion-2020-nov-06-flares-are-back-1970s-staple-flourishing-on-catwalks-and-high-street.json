But flares \u2013 a 70s staple \u2013 had previously taken a backseat to fashion\u2019s infatuation with tinted aviators, crop tops and clogs. That is, until now. In the past week alone, the model Kaia Gerber and the singer Dua Lipa have worn flared blue jeans. Elsewhere, Nigella Lawson opted for red Safiyaa flares for her appearance in the December issue of Good Housekeeping, and Claudia Winkleman went full disco in a pair of flared sequin trousers from Zara to present Sunday\u2019s episode of Strictly Come Dancing. On the catwalk, subtly flared trousers were featured throughout Hedi Slimane\u2019s Celine collection for this season while, at Gucci, flares were cropped and overt. Richard Quinn and JW Anderson even showcased more exaggerated bell-bottomed styles \u2013 tapering in at the knee, then out at the ankle. Meanwhile, a collection launched last week by the estate of the late rapper Lil Peep included three pairs of flares, in black, pink or green vegan leather. According to Lyst, online searches for \u201cflared jeans\u201d were up 145% in the three months to October, compared with the same period last year. Interestingly, whereas the high street often has a tendency to tone down catwalk extremes, bell-bottomed flares have flourished, particularly when it comes to soft, elasticated styles (rather than denim). At Asos, for example, there are over 400 flared trousers currently on offer, with options such as \u201ckick flare leggings\u201d, \u201cjersey flare trousers\u201d, \u201csupersoft\u201d flares and \u201cslinky\u201d flares prominent among them \u2013 suggesting our pandemic-induced love affair with comfortable clothes is not over yet. Recently dubbed both the \u201canti-skinny jean\u201d and an alternative to leggings, it\u2019s little wonder that flares are helping us get into the groove of lockdown 2.0. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, optimistic, disco \u2026 the whole Cher vibe,\u201d says the fashion historian Tony Glenville, who argues that flares are a classic, rather than a passing trend. \u201cWe may not party but we can dream. It\u2019s about a great silhouette.\u201d Despite flares\u2019 retro roots, Aurore Bardey, a senior lecturer in psychology at London Metropolitan University, argues that 2020\u2019s iteration are different to their 1970s predecessors. \u201cI would say that the return of flares has nothing to do with 70s or nostalgia but is a response to consumers\u2019 needs of being comfortable and still elegant,\u201d she says. \u201cThe 70s flares were defined as an innovative way of wearing the usual denim associated with industrial workers [whereas] 2020 flares [are a way] to be comfortable (working from home, not having as many social events as pre-covid) and still be trendy.\u201d After months of so-called \u201cZoom dressing\u201d, and a focus solely on clothing designed for the waist up, it seems legs are once again getting a look in \u2013 although shoes are still very much optional. Wear with a silky shirt Channel your inner Farrah Fawcett by pairing flared jeans with a silky shirt (or a turtleneck, now the weather\u2019s turned) and blazer jacket (which you can buy secondhand). Your shoes should be completely covered by flare, so it appears almost as if you are floating \u2013 like an angel. Go high-waisted and velvet Trousers are the gateway flare, between jeans and leggings; wear them like you used to wear 90s bootcut jeans \u2013 eg with \u201ca nice top\u201d. Keep your waistband high and your footwear chunky. Split hems and velvet flares are good options here, too. Embrace knits and ribbing Flared leggings are the most daring option \u2026 but also the most pyjama like? TikTok teens like to pair their kick-flare leggings with crop-top co-ords and bucket hats, but don\u2019t panic. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. For maximum cosiness, go for thick, ribbed, high-waisted flared leggings and an oversized jumper. Knitted flares work too, honest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
