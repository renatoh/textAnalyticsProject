The case, brought by the hotelier Julian Gerner, unsuccessfully sought to argue that the Australian constitution contains an implied freedom of movement for any reason. Together with the court\u2019s decision to reject Clive Palmer\u2019s challenge of the Western Australian border ban earlier on Friday, the judgment gives state and territory governments considerable latitude to restrict movement within and between jurisdictions to fight the coronavirus. After taking oral submissions from the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Bret Walker, on Friday morning, the justices returned from a short adjournment to announce the result. The chief justice, Susan Kiefel, told the solicitor general for Victoria, Kristen Walker, there was no need for oral submissions in support of the state\u2019s case, which rejected the existence of the implied freedom of movement. Kiefel said the justices had unanimously upheld Victoria\u2019s demurrer, an objection that even if the court accepts the facts as stated by the plaintiffs, the legal arguments made on the basis of those facts do not hold. Earlier, Walker had argued that the court should find the constitution contains an implied freedom of movement in the same way the high court had found an implied freedom of political communication in 1992. Walker argued that the nature of the Australian nation as a \u201ccommunity of people\u201d required not just political communication but also \u201cphysical transport\u201d of its people. Although no reasons have been published for the decision, justices cast doubt on the proposition throughout the hearing. Justice Stephen Gageler queried whether authorities provided support for the existence of the freedom or the plaintiffs had merely \u201ccobbled together\u201d statements that were consistent with it. Justice Patrick Keane noted that although the constitution grants a degree of freedom of intercourse between the states, the constitutional conventions had rejected calls for freedom to move \u201cthroughout the commonwealth\u201d. Justice Michelle Gordon suggested the case had fallen into the trap of construing what is \u201crequired by federation\u201d as something that is also \u201cimplied by the text and structure of the constitution\u201d. Walker agreed that the \u201cvibe\u201d of Australia\u2019s unity as a federation was not enough, but said evidence of the freedom was found in the text and structure of the constitution. Walker argued without the freedom, a government could confine Australians to cells with electronic communication only in a bid to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. \u201cNobody would say it would suffice to allow the people at the next election to get rid of a government that did that,\u201d he said. Rather, citizens needed to \u201clearn about society and those who govern it\u201d by participating in and moving around \u2013 to \u201csee how things are\u201d in places such as Ballarat and Mornington. The Victorian government\u2019s restriction of movement to 5km \u201cgoes too far or rather prevents people going far enough\u201d, Walker argued. In October, the Victorian government relaxed the lockdown after successfully reducing Covid-19 transmissions. Nevertheless, the decision will bolster states\u2019 legal defences in the event that further restrictions might be required. In its written submissions, Victoria noted the plaintiffs were a Mornington Peninsula resident and a restaurant that had suffered a hit to earnings due to restrictions. It argued the case required the plaintiffs to prove a \u201cgeneral implied freedom of movement for any reason\u201d because they had not pleaded facts demonstrating the lockdown amounted to a limit on political communication. Victoria noted that the constitution contains powers for quarantine, defence and aliens \u2013 all of which allow limitations on freedom of movement. \u201cThere are tensions (if not outright inconsistency) between the implication for which the plaintiffs contend and the constitutional scheme,\u201d Victoria submitted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
