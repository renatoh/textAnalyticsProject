Supporters of the Dalai Lama said 80 people were killed during the protests in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, with at least 72 others injured. It was the latest negative publicity for China ahead of the Beijing Olympics in August. Today Buddhist monks clashed with armed police in Sichuan province after the monks staged a protest, said a witness in Aba county who refused to give his name. He said one policeman had been killed and three or four police vans had been set on fire. Protests were reported in Sichuan, Qinghai and Gansu provinces. All have Tibetan populations. The demonstrations came after five days of protests in Lhasa escalated into violence on Friday, with protesters setting fire to police cars and shops in the fiercest challenge to Beijing's rule over the region in nearly two decades. Thubten Samphel, a spokesman for the Dalai Lama's government, said multiple witnesses inside Tibet had reported at least 80 people had been killed since the violence broke out Friday. He did not know how many of the bodies were those of protesters. The official Xinhua news agency has said at least 10 civilians were burned to death on Friday. \"Whether intentionally or unintentionally, some kind of cultural genocide is taking place,\" the Dalai Lama said, referring to China's policy of encouraging members of the ethnic Han majority to migrate to the region, as well as restrictions on Buddhist temples and re-education programs for monks. The Dalai Lama \u2014 the Tibetans' spiritual leader \u2014 told reporters in Dharmsala, the north Indian town where Tibet's self-declared government-in-exile is based, that an international body should investigate the government's crackdown on the Lhasa protests. In an interview with the BBC, the Dalai Lama said he fears the situation could easily worsen. \"It's possible, it's very possible. It's really desperate,\" he said. \"Things become tense as the Tibetan side is determined, the Chinese side also equally determined. So that means the result is killing, most often.\" Tibetan officials rejected the Dalai Lama's cultural genocide remarks as \"downright nonsense.\" The mayor of Lhasa, Doje Cezhug, said Tibet would be in its \"best period of development in history\" if not for the meddling of \"Dalai separatist groups,\" Xinhua reported."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
