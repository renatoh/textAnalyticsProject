The Bohusl\u00e4n ensemble is one of only two full-time big-bands working in Sweden, often featuring big-time guest composers, and currently run by elegantly nimble trombonist Nils Landgren with the UK's Colin Towns taking the arranger's role on this Cole Porter reappraisal. Landgren sings on most of the pieces, and his distinctive sound (somewhere between a pragmatic Nina Simone and the distracted cool of Chet Baker) imparts to these much-travelled classics an unsentimental simplicity that divertingly recasts them even without the aid of Colin Towns's dazzling arrangements. The opening instrumental account of From This Moment On explodes with a Towns barrage of tailchasing countermelodies and scorching high brass riffs, but Too Darn Hot is delivered more like a carol or a hymn, and Love for Sale unfolds with soft conga rhythms and hollow-toned tenor sax. Miss Otis Regrets opens with an overture of misty brass impressionism before Landgren's spoken lyrics, and an undertow of A Love Supreme's theme close to the end, and the contrapuntal intertwining of reeds, trombones and bass clarinet makes a haunting valediction of Every Time We Say Goodbye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
