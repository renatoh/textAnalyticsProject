Rouble, trained a dozen miles away by Josh Gifford, beat Stromness and Jair Du Cochet by three lengths and a half, and will go to Cheltenham as Gifford's best chance of a winner at what could be his last Festival. It was a clever, front-running ride by Leighton Aspell which sealed Rouble's success, and he travels and jumps like a horse who should improve again for the fast pace of the Festival. Though still a novice, he took on Jair Du Cochet at level weights yesterday, and it was a surprise to find him unchanged at 12-1 with Coral afterwards for the Royal &amp; SunAlliance. Rouble was friendless in the ring beforehand, too, drifting to 6-1 from 4-1. Perhaps they had heard about his \"wind problem\", a noise he makes when galloping which Gifford, after 50 years in the game, knows he probably shouldn't. Whatever the cause, though - and the trainer is still trying to work it out - both Gifford and Aspell agree that it does not appear to take even half a length off his form. \"Henrietta [Knight] rang me and suggested I try a new bit on him which had worked on one of her good horses,\" Gifford said, \"and Leighton came and schooled him yesterday morning and said he thought it worked.\" As for Jair Du Cochet, who started at 8-13, this was hardly the comfortable warm-up for the Stayers' Hurdle which several thousand racegoers had hoped to see. Coral knocked him out to 8-1 (from 11-2) for Cheltenham, although the Tote offer just 5-1 (from 4-1). Guillaume Macaire, Jair Du Cochet's trainer, was as phlegmatic as anyone could be after travelling from the south of France to win a little over \u00a32,000. Yesterday was his first visit to Fontwell, and though the course is a particular favourite of many racegoers, you sensed that it may also be his last. \"Now I have seen the track I know why Baracouda was nearly beaten in the race last year,\" he said. \"It is very tight, and the ground today is very sticky, and on the turns a horse like Jair Du Cochet finds it very difficult - he was swimming. Comparing this course to Cheltenham is like comparing day with night.\" Macaire opted for the National Spirit, and not the Rendlesham Hurdle at Kempton on Friday, to avoid taking on Baracouda - the 4-6 favourite for the Stayers' with Coral - before the Festival. That day is barely three weeks away, though. Jair Du Cochet must find several lengths by March 14, and on yesterday's form you would not want to back him to do it. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
