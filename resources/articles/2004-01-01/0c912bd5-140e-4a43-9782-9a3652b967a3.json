The government had become so concerned about the cost of experienced teachers moving up the profession's pay scale every year that it ordered a clampdown in the wake of the 2003 budget crisis, angering classroom and headteacher unions. Under the draft agreement, two rungs of the salary ladder would be scrapped and a salary of \u00a331,602 would be the level to which teachers in England and Wales who wanted to stay in the classroom and not become heads or deputies could \"aspire\". Long-serving London teachers will be able to earn up to \u00a337,692. There will also be some kind of bonus scheme on top of that for \"excellent\" teachers. The education secretary, Charles Clarke, said the draft agreement was \"a further success for the social partnership approach we are taking in our continued positive engagement with trade unions and employers, following last year's national agreement of workforce reform\". The agreement now has to be endorsed by the ruling executives of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, the National Association of Head Teachers, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, the Secondary Heads Association and the Professional Association of Teachers. The general secretaries of those unions said it was a practical solution to a long-running disagreement. The National Union of Teachers, the largest of the unions, is not backing the deal. Opposed to performance-related pay, it was not involved in the talks with the other unions, although it did have bilateral discussions with ministers. The NUT's general secretary, Doug McAvoy, said there was no guarantee that schools, still recovering from last year's budgets crisis, would have the money needed to ensure all their teachers who deserved to could move up the pay scale. He said \"Hobson's choice\" would prevail, as some schools would have enough to pay all their teachers the right rate, while others would have to pick and choose between equally deserving members of staff. \"It's a sorry state of affairs. Promises were made in 1998 and have now been withdrawn. \"In real terms, the ceiling that teachers can reach now is much lower than we were promised in 1998,\" added Mr McAvoy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
