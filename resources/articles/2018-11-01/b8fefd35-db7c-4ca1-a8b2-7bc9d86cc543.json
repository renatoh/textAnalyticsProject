Clarke unleashed a social media rant on Wednesday night, labelling the broadcaster a \u201cheadline chasing coward\u201d for insinuating he had a hand in the cultural failings that led to the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town. By Thursday morning, Clarke was not willing to take a backward step. \u201cThat\u2019s 100% how I feel,\u201d Clarke said on Macquarie Radio. \u201cI look forward to one day saying that to his face. \u201cWhen somebody questions or insults my integrity and my credibility that\u2019s not for sale. That\u2019s not on so I\u2019ve made my feelings very clear on social media... what Gerard has said is completely out of line. Trying to blame me for cheating in South Africa is an absolute disgrace.\u201d Whateley was equally unwilling to back down. \u201cAustralia\u2019s quest is indeed to restore respect but without being reviled,\u201d he said to start his SEN radio program. \u201cAnd that was the descent that began under Clarke.\u201d Whateley had claimed the Australian cricket team\u2019s cultural issues could be traced to Clarke\u2019s appointment as captain. Clarke suggested they should prioritise playing \u201ctough\u201d cricket over being liked. \u201cPerhaps if he was talented enough or courageous enough to make it onto a cricket pitch he would have a better perspective than from behind a microphone,\u201d Clarke wrote in his social media post. In the open letter, Clarke listed several \u201cfacts\u201d pointing to his stellar resume as skipper all while playing \u201cby the rules\u201d. He also said many \u201crespected journalists and seniors within the Australian cricket team\u201d had reached out in support of his view on the national set-up\u2019s ethos. Former opener Matthew Hayden was one ex-teammate to publicly back him despite the New South Welshman\u2019s long-time rival Simon Katich arguing he had missed the point. The imposing Queenslander echoed Clarke\u2019s words, saying the team could lose its competitive edge if it stopped playing \u201chard and fair\u201d cricket. \u201cYou play the game in a spirit that\u2019s a competitive spirit and you don\u2019t play because you want to have a masters in being a good bloke,\u201d Hayden told Fairfax Media. Hayden added Australia\u2019s cricketers should not be worried about their \u201cbrand\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
