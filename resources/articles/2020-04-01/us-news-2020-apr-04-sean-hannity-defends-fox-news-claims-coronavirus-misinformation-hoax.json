Hannity\u2019s statements to Newsweek were in response to a 1 April open letter signed by 74 journalism professors and leading journalists that lambasted Fox News for allegedly spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the outbreak. The professors directly cited Hannity\u2019s statement that the Democrats and media overplayed coronavirus to \u201cbludgeon Trump with this new hoax\u201d. The letter came before a report in The Daily Beast that Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, are bracing for lawsuits over the network\u2019s coronavirus coverage. Asked about his statement that Democrats and the media were using Covid-19 \u201cto bludgeon Trump\u201d, Hannity responded: \u201cMany of them did.\u201d \u201cWe are in the middle of the huge pandemic and where\u2019s the Democrat saying, \u2018You know, I didn\u2019t agree with the travel ban at the time, but it was the right decision.\u2019 Politics trumps truth in their world.\u201d Hannity was referring to Trump\u2019s decision to clamp down on \u2013 but not shut down, despite his repeated claims \u2013 travel from China as the virus broke out there. \u201cIt\u2019s the same Democrats,\u201d Hannity continued, \u201cmedia mob and liberal professors who are so lazy they won\u2019t even look at what I\u2019ve said about the virus. They just go with their narrative. I never called it a \u2018hoax\u2019. \u201cI said it was a hoax for them to be using it as a bludgeon on Trump. And they are. [House intelligence chair] Adam Schiff and [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi are talking about an investigation. Now? In the middle of a pandemic?\u201d Hannity also said: \u201cGo to my website and you\u2019ll see irrefutable evidence that I have taken this seriously way before most in the media did. I warned in January that it was dangerous because it was highly contagious, but some people were asymptomatic, so it would spread quickly.\u201d The professors\u2019 letter, addressed to both Murdochs, claimed: \u201cViewers of Fox News, including the president of the United States, have been regularly subjected to misinformation relayed by the network\u2013false statements downplaying the prevalence of Covid-19 and its harms.\u201d The professors claimed Fox News offered \u201cmisleading recommendations of activities that people should undertake to protect themselves and others, including casual recommendations of untested drugs; false assessments of the value of measures urged upon the public by their elected political leadership and public health authorities\u201d. The Mediaite website points out that Fox News has taken some actions that seemingly view coronavirus more seriously \u2013 with Hannity and other talking heads such as Tucker Carlson appearing in a public service announcement, for example. On Friday night, Carlson criticized Trump administration infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci, over his call for a national stay-at-home mandate. \u201cMore than 10 million Americans have already lost their jobs,\u201d the host said. \u201cImagine another year of this. That would be national suicide, and yet, that is what Anthony Fauci is suggesting, at least. \u201cNow, we\u2019re not suggesting that Fauci wants to hurt America. We don\u2019t think he does, he seems like a very decent man. But Fauci is not an economist or for that matter someone who fears being unemployed himself. Like most of the people around him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
