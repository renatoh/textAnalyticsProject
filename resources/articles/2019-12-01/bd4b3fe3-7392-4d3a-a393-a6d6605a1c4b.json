Miller Thomson LLP sent a letter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Friday, requesting authorities \u201cconduct an exhumation and postmortem autopsy\u201d on the body of Gerald Cotten, founder of QuadrigaCX, citing what the firm called the \u201cquestionable circumstances\u201d around his death earlier this year. Citing \u201cdecomposition concerns\u201d, lawyers requested the exhumation be completed no later than spring 2020. Gerald Cotten, 30, died abruptly in December 2018 of complications relating to Crohn\u2019s disease while on honeymoon in Jaipur, India, with his wife, Jennifer Robertson. His body was repatriated to Canada and a funeral was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Soon after his death, however, reports surfaced that nearly 80,000 users of QuadrigaCX \u2013 at the time Canada\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange \u2013 were unable to access funds totalling more $190m. Cotten was the only one with access to necessary permissions. While Robertson has possession of the laptop containing the necessary passwords, she remains locked out. \u201cThe laptop computer from which Gerry carried out the companies\u2019 business is encrypted and I do not know the password or recovery key. Despite repeated and diligent searches, I have not been able to find them written down anywhere,\u201d she said in court filings. Uncertainty about the missing funds has fueled speculation that Cotten may still be alive. In their letter to the RCMP the law firm underlined the \u201cneed for certainty around the question of whether Mr Cotten is in fact deceased\u201d. The accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, tasked with auditing the company as it undergoes bankruptcy proceedings, discovered numerous money-losing trades executed by Cotten, using customers\u2019 funds. They also found a substantial amount of money was used to fund a lavish lifestyle for the couple, including the use of private jets and luxury vehicles. Ernst &amp; Young was able to recover $24m in cash and $9m in assets held by Robertson. Both Canada\u2019s tax authorities and the FBI are also investigating the company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
