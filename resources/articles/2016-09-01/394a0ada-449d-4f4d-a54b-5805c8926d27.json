LendUp \u2013 a San Francisco firm that claims to offer a \u201csecure, convenient way to get the money you need, fast\u201d \u2013 misled customers, hid its true credit costs, and reversed pricing without disclosing it to consumers, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). \u201cLendUp pitched itself as a consumer-friendly, tech-savvy alternative to traditional payday loans, but it did not pay enough attention to the consumer financial laws,\u201d bureau director Richard Cordray said in a statement Tuesday, announcing the settlement. The company, which has funding from high-profile Silicon Valley venture capital firms and GV, Google\u2019s venture capital branch, began marketing its services in 2012. The startup claimed it would help consumers \u201cmove up the LendUp Ladder\u201d by building credit and improving their scores. The firm promised customers the opportunity to eventually progress to loans with more favorable terms, such as longer repayment periods and lower rates. But regulators allege that the startup\u2019s offerings did not match its advertising and that the firm failed to properly provide information to credit reporting companies, which denied consumers the opportunity to enhance their credit. The federal agency has ordered LendUp to pay a $1.8m penalty and provide more than 50,000 consumers with roughly $1.8m in refunds. The California department of business oversight also investigated the firm and announced a settlement this week requiring LendUp to pay $2.7m to \u201cresolve allegations it charged illegal fees and committed other widespread violations of payday and installment lending laws\u201d. The state agency said the startup had paid $1m in refunds but still owes $537,000 to borrowers. Experts say the case is significant for firms in the emerging online \u201cfintech\u201d sector that have claimed to offer better services than traditional payday loan industry businesses, known for trapping low-income Americans in cycles of debt. Companies like LendUp have attracted positive press from the tech media in recent years. TechCrunch said the startup would make the \u201cloan experience for the millions of unbanked Americans more fair and transparent\u201d. Time Magazine said it offered an \u201cinnovative new payday loan banking model that\u2019s more Silicon Valley than Wall Street\u201d. The violations raise questions about that kind of praise and suggest that regulators must do a better job scrutinizing online startups, said Liana Molina, director of community engagement for the California Reinvestment Coalition, a group that advocates for fair banking access for low-income communities. \u201cThe main takeaway here is that online payday loans ... are just as dangerous if not more so than those products available in the storefronts,\u201d she said, adding that restrictions across the board need to be strengthened to better shield vulnerable people from harmful loans. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more work to be done \u2026 [but] it sends a strong message to quote-unquote \u2018innovators\u2019 in this space that they need to adhere to existing protections.\u201d In June, the CFPB pushed forward new rules aimed at regulating the $38.5bn payday loan industry, requiring lenders to verify the income of borrowers to ensure they can afford to repay the loans. As a result, digital lending services are rapidly expanding, said Paige Marta Skiba, Vanderbilt University economist and law professor. \u201cWe\u2019re about to see the kind of wild wild west of online lending.\u201d This week\u2019s enforcement actions could impede funding efforts for LendUp and its competitors, which could have hurt companies trying to offer fairer alternatives, Skiba added. \u201cPeople willing to invest in this kind of startup are going to be all the more scared \u2026 It\u2019s going to be difficult, if not impossible.\u201d LendUp downplayed the penalties in a statement, saying the penalties \u201caddress legacy issues that mostly date back to our early days as a company, when we were a seed-stage startup with limited resources and as few as five employees\u201d. The firm now has dedicated compliance and legal teams and has \u201cfully addressed the issues cited by our regulators, including discontinuing some services\u201d, the statement said. The LendUp penalties are also noteworthy given that Google, a key funder, announced this year that it would no longer sell ads for payday loan companies, saying they were \u201cdangerous products\u201d classified in the same category as guns and tobacco. At the time, LendUp criticized the ban, saying it was too broad and would negatively affect them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
