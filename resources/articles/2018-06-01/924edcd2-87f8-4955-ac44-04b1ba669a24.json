The transport secretary had been due to appear at the Place North West conference on Monday alongside political leaders from across the region following weeks of rail misery for commuters. Organisers confirmed Grayling would not attend the summit and would instead send Liz Sugg, the parliamentary undersecretary of state for transport, to give a presentation in his place. The about-turn was condemned by Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, who said it told commuters \u201call you need to know about the government\u2019s transport priorities\u201d. Instead of addressing rail issues in the north of England, Grayling is to attend a Commons vote expected to approve plans for a third runway at Heathrow. They will be opposed by a handful of prominent Conservatives including Greg Hands, who resigned as international trade minister last week so he could vote against expansion. Lisa Nandy, the Labour MP for Wigan, criticised Grayling for choosing London over the north. \u201cAfter four weeks of rail chaos and real misery for rail passengers across the north of England, it\u2019s unbelievable that Chris Grayling has decided to prioritise dealing with issues in London around Heathrow rather than coming here to the north of England to explain what he\u2019s going to do to get a grip on the problems occurring under this watch,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s yet another kick in the teeth for rail commuters and it says everything you need to know about the contempt with which this government holds the north of England.\u201d Commuters across the region have faced hundreds of cancellations and delays since Northern rail introduced a new timetable on 20 May. Northern, a subsidiary of Arriva, has blamed the disruption on delayed engineering works and a shortage of trained drivers. The rail conference will take place days after the publication of private emails in which officials in Grayling\u2019s department described some northern routes as \u201cvalueless\u201d, in comments that showed \u201ccomplete disrespect and contempt\u201d for passengers, said Nandy. The situation was made worse last week by three 24-hour strikes by some Northern staff over a long-running safety dispute about guards on trains. Earlier this month, the RMT union said it planned to demonstrate outside the Hilton hotel in central Manchester, where the meeting is taking place, as part of the dispute and what they described as the \u201congoing rail franchise fiasco\u201d. Mick Cash, the RMT general secretary, said: \u201cChris Grayling is running scared. He\u2019s scared of the passengers he\u2019s hung out to dry and he\u2019s scared of the staff whose safety-critical jobs his franchise shambles have left facing the axe. \u201cChris Grayling may have chickened out of meeting RMT members and their supporters on Monday, but I\u2019ve got a message for him \u2013 you can run but you can\u2019t hide.\u201d Hundreds of Labour supporters are planning to demonstrate outside train stations across the country on Monday to mark the first working day of the east coast mainline being brought back into public control. Party members wearing Grayling masks were expected to hand out fliers to commuters calling for the renationalisation of the railways following the collapse of the Virgin and Stagecoach East Coast franchise. The vital London to Scotland service is now being run by the Department for Transport\u2019s operator of last resort and branded as London North Eastern Railway. Its first service left Newcastle for London King\u2019s Cross at 7.54am on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
