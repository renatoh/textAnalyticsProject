The north-east regional assembly saw the strength in regional unity 15 years ago when it established the association of north-east councils to lobby for a better deal for the region. This has grown into a strong and effective regional assembly, made up of representatives from the public, voluntary and private sectors. But while the assembly is an effective lobbying organisation, and is consulted by ministers on regional policy, its members want direct power to govern their own affairs. A devolved regional government with its powers taken from Westminster would enable us to build on our work so far, and to exploit our distinctiveness. We in the regional assembly see enormous benefit in having more control over our economy, in having more power to market our region and in being able to demonstrate a high degree of autonomy to outsiders. When global inward investos looks at a site in the north-east we want to be able to tell them, hand on heart, that we control all of the key regional elements in their decision making. This includes economic development, transport, housing, education, health, the environment and planning. The economic disparities between the north-east and Scotland, as well as southern England, are a further pull towards regional government. We have lobbied hard in the hope of establishing a more level playing field. We want to win better and more flexible funding arrangements from central government for our councils and public services, and to even up the very real and substantial economic divides. In a tougher economic climate, I can see a time when people in my region will look long and hard at the benefits of the Welsh assembly and Scottish executive, and become even more aware of the need to have greater power over our destinies. At present, a huge amount of power over matters such as funding for our public services lies in the hands of relatively unaccountable appointees, both in quangos and in Whitehall. A regional government would increase democracy and bring power closer to the people. We see the powers for this body coming through decentralisation from London, rather than from centralising the responsibilities already held by local councils. A north-east regional government would be more accessible to the public and private sectors, as well as local communities. People will be able to have a far greater level of influence on decision making than if they tried to lobby London civil servants or ministers. The regional government will be in a position to respond quickly to the issues and concerns of the region. I sense a growing cultural change in the people of the north-east, and their desire to take control of their lives. We do not want to be spoon-fed money on terms decided by someone outside our region any more. At the north-east regional assembly we believe there is a growing groundswell of support for devolution and to test this there is to be a public consultation over the next two months. Our reasons for wanting, and needing, a regional government are clear. Now we will demonstrate it is what the people of the north-east want."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
