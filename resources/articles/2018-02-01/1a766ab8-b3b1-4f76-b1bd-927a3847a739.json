Melinda Gates said: \u201cI wish our president would treat people, and especially women, with more respect when he speaks and tweets.\u201d And Bill Gates warned that the Trump administration\u2019s proposed budget could directly lead to millions of preventable deaths around the globe, because of vast cuts to foreign aid and development funds. At an event with his wife to mark their foundation\u2019s annual philanthropic letter, he said: \u201cUS generosity \u2026 if that goes away, even a 10% cut would mean 5 million deaths over the next decade.\u201d The Trump administration, as it did last year, has proposed billions of dollars in cuts to foreign aid, which makes up less than 1% of US spending. Last year, lawmakers in Congress from both parties mostly ignored the request, and Gates said he hoped they would again this year too. In a separate interview, Melinda Gates criticized Trump\u2019s habit of using Twitter to attack women and minority groups. \u201cThose kinds of comments just don\u2019t belong in the public discourse,\u201d she told the Associated Press. She added that while some of Trump\u2019s comments about women have troubled her, his rejection of the feminist label has not. \u201cSome men have trouble and some women, quite frankly, have trouble embracing that term and what it means, so that honestly doesn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s more the specific comments he\u2019s made over and over again about specific people or minorities or women that just do not reflect the values I see across the United States,\u201d she said. In the Gates Foundation letter, the couple said: \u201cEquality is an important national principle. The sanctity of each individual, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender, is part of our country\u2019s spirit.\u201d Bill Gates called on Trump not to cut aid to the developing world. He said: \u201cTo have Africa be stable, to have health systems that stop pandemics, and to reduce the chance of our army having to go fight somewhere and lose lives: these investments, even in that sort of \u2018America first\u2019 mindset, are still very, very wise.\u201d Melinda Gates also expressed dismay at the administration\u2019s budget \u201czeroing out\u201d funds for contraception. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving women in destitute poverty if you don\u2019t fund contraceptives,\u201d she said. The budget move follows Trump\u2019s executive order instituting a \u201cgag rule\u201d on US-funded international NGOs providing abortion services. The Gates foundation is the largest philanthropic organization in the world, with an endowment of more than $40bn. For the past 10 years, Bill and Melinda Gates have released an annual letter outlining the state of their work and focus areas for the following year. Despite concern about the effects of cuts to US aid, the pair remained optimistic. \u201cThe world is getting better by almost every objective measure,\u201d Bill Gates said, citing the example of child mortality, the foundation\u2019s top priority in recent years.\u201cWhen we got going, about 12 million kids were dying a year under the age of five. Now, because of vaccines and things that we\u2019ve done with partners, that number is under 5 million.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
