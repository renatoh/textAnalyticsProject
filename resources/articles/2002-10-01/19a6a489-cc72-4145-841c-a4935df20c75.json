Yesterday, however, Robson was talking medicine. Craig Bellamy, Kieron Dyer and Lomano Lua Lua all have injuries of varying seriousness with Bellamy's being the most worrying as it has suddenly re-emerged. The Welshman is again causing concern due to the knee injury that has already curtailed his career, if not his impact, on Tyneside. Robson said yesterday that Newcastle had consulted the famous surgeon Richard Steadman in America to see just how bad Bellamy's latest set-back is. The original problem was tendinitis around the knee. It came to light, said Robson, on Monday when Bellamy reported for training after the defeat at Blackburn Rovers last Saturday. \"He had been going around saying his knee was terrific and he told me he didn't feel it any more,\" Robson said of Bellamy yesterday afternoon. \"But he was unable to train fully on either Monday or Tuesday after complaining about a pain once again. We have spoken to Dr Steadman about it and he has said to let it settle for a couple of days. \"We'll re-assess him and Kieron before Charlton [tomorrow] but both are doubts. Kieron still has a spasm and some restriction in his back that we can't understand.\" Both Bellamy and Dyer missed the Juventus game, Bellamy because he was suspended as well as injured, but Lua Lua did well particularly after half-time in filling the holes vacated by the two players. In stretching for a tackle, though, Lua Lua damaged his knee and there is swelling, Robson reported. The combined effect was to sap a lot of the effervescence Newcastle had looked to derive from a compelling evening at St James' Park. Anyone wishing to gauge the enormity of what victory over Juventus meant to the Tyneside club should have heard Andy Griffin. It was, he said, as good as beating Sunderland. In switching from the champions of Italy to the team second bottom of the Premiership, Griffin made a lurch that said perhaps more than he meant about Newcastle. Last Saturday, after all, Newcastle were in Robson's term \"battered\" 5-2 by Blackburn. To follow that with a 1-0 win over Juventus is an indication of just how unpredictable Newcastle are at present. But Wednesday was the first of five consecutive home games in the space of 14 days and it was because of this passage of matches that could shape a season that Robson mentioned injection. Now Newcastle need another."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
