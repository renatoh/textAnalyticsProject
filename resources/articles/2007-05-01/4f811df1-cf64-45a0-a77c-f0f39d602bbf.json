TG's music hasn't undergone as much of a radical transformation. It sounds like creepy supper club music, the kind of thing Mohamed al-Fayed might commission to have piped through the halls of Harrods as a requiem to Diana and Dodi. Predictably, it lingers in the air like a bad smell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
