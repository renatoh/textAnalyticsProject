You've decided that, finally, this is the Christmas you will spend in Australia, all those thousands of miles away, and, having discovered cricket last year when England finally won the Ashes back after 18 years, you are going out there to give them a cheer. Well, good luck - because you are probably in for as interesting an initiation as are Ian Bell and Alastair Cook, England's young tour debutants who will be dodging the red leather in your name. Australia is more than a country. It's a revelation. Going there for the first time is like looking in a mirror and seeing a slightly skewed image of yourself. How did they get to talk like that? Why are they shouting at me? How can they possibly drink one more can of that awful lager? And why are they so bloody friendly? Australians have a sense of humour that relies heavily on what you might call fond abuse, so don't be offended; be pleased they're being rude to you. It comes just before they buy you a middy (9oz of usually freezing cold lager) or, if they really like you, a schooner (about three-quarters of a pint). And be sure to get your Wally Grout (shout) in, because they are a bit strong on that sort of thing. In fact, don't even think of leaving town before getting it all square. Psychologists probably have written reams of wise words on why the Australian male feels disposed to show affection aggressively and, no doubt, it has to do with mateship and the fact that, for much of its early colonised history, there was a horrific 2:1 ratio of men to women. That's the sort of past that comes loaded with macho baggage. But, really, they're as harmless as a sleeping possum. Anyway, revel in being a Pommy bastard, even if that accolade is a bit dated. And, if Customs ask if you have a criminal record when you arrive, resist the temptation to say you didn't know you still needed one. That joke has got hairs on it. You can make life easier for yourself if you do your homework. Australians (like everyone) appreciate it if you know a little bit about their culture and peculiarities, as well as their heroes and villains. Don't, for instance, let on you've never heard of Kath and Kim - pearls in a very ordinary TV pool. Australian television is consistently appalling, and always has been. So, avoid the box except for checking the weather. Even that's redundant. While it does rain, especially in Melbourne, you're more likely get burnt than drowned. Australians have become paranoid about skin cancer. Rightly so. Someone discovered a while ago that one of the ozone holes was right above them and, ever since, they've been walking around greased up to the eyeballs. So don't fall asleep in the stands. But forget what your uncle Albert might have written to you about Australia when he emigrated 20 years ago. It's a vibrant, cosmopolitan place packed with luxury and temptations of all kinds. This is my personal list of favourite things to do and see: walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge at sunset - on the top, rigged up with all the safety kit, of course. It's a view you'll not forget. Take a harbour taxi from Circular Quay to Doyles restaurant at Watsons Bay in mid-afternoon, queue there for an early supper of the finest, freshest John Dory or seabass and look back towards the bridge as the sun goes down on a view that man, somehow, has improved on. Hire a car and drive through the vineyards of the Hunter Valley to taste first hand those wines you pay a fortune for in restaurants at home; go surfing; eat a meat pie - upside down with lots of tomato sauce squeezed into the crust; don't hang out in the over-excitable Bay 13, as it used to be known, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground; do try any of the wonderful restaurants in St Kilda; leave the coast for a day or two and just drive inland - whatever you find will be something to remember, either a one-street town or just acres of silence, for miles and miles; eat as much of the local seafood as you can take, because you're unlikely to ever again come across Balmain bugs (nicer than they sound); and go to races - Randwick in Sydney, Flemington in Melbourne, or one of the many small country tracks. If there is a trick to surviving an Ashes tour, it is in the language. Here is a brief guide, reliable at the time of writing but subject to change, given Australians' gift for improvisation. Your basic form of insult: you are a 'bit of a dill' if you act like 'a goose' and show all the intellectual qualities of 'a galah'. Once, you might have been 'as mad as a two-bob watch' but Australia has been metric since 1966, so that one has faded into antiquity. Cockneys who imagine theirs is the only rhyming slang will be disabused of that notion soon enough. It flourishes in Australia. You can go 'jungle-jimming' at Bondi Beach, avoiding the 'afters' (after darks - sharks), then step out in your 'bag of fruit', and you might get a bit 'Adrians' (Adrian Quist, a famous tennis player). Gambling is the national sport so if you fancy a bet, look for a 'billy' (billy goat - Tote), and you will find one in the bar of nearly any 'bib' (bib'n'bub - pub). There are some local cuties that are almost impossible to fathom unless you're a native. A Blundstone is a utility truck or ute, coming from Blundstone boot, which is workmen's footwear of choice. If you're going to leg it from some embarrassing situation, you can 'Harold', or bolt. Harold Holt was an Australian Prime Minister who disappeared after going for a swim. Nobody actually calls beer 'the amber nectar' any more either, although it is as well to know that 'a pot' does not necessarily have anything to do with marijuana, but is a small beer in Victoria and unknown in New South Wales. 'Old' beer is darker than 'new' and more like proper beer. Tooheys Old, or 'black' as it is known in northern NSW, is good. A lot of the other stuff is undrinkable. The two subjects guaranteed to spark a lively response in Australian conversation, by the way, are politics and women. I don't know of any political rhyming slang but if you make disparaging remarks about their Prime Minister, 'Little Johnny' Howard, you're bound to get some sort of response. Women are Charlie's - Charlie Wheeler, Sheila - and, if you make a hash of talking to one, you are said to be having a bit of a Barry - Barry Crocker, shocker. If something is not as it seems, it is 'a Clayton's', which was a non-alcoholic drink - the drink you're having when you're not having a drink. But you don't want to witter away your holiday tangled up in the local argot. There are so many great places to see and things to do that, like many visitors before you, you might just find yourself making plans to emigrate. And, if you bed in there permanently as an Aussie, you will then be able to be just as rude about Bloody Poms as the natives. What a life to look forward to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
