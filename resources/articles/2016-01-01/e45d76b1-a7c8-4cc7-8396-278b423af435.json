But 2016 isn't right", "bodyText": "There\u2019s almost certainly a joke in the sad reality that Sarah Palin will officially jump onboard the Trump Make-America-Great-Again Express in the town of Ames, Iowa. Ames, you see, is home to the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural Research Service National Animal Disease Center (where the most recent \u201cPast Event\u201d listed on the website is \u201cYear one of porcine epidemic diarrhea, what we learned\u201d), but I think I\u2019d rather quit this paragraph before I\u2019m done. Anyway: the real question isn\u2019t over why Donald Trump is, uh, trumpeting his coveted Palin endorsement \u2013 they clearly speak the same language of bombast and Big Gulp to an audience hungry for big government jibes along with their ethanol subsidies (though Palin was opposed). The question isn\u2019t even: is this a liberal\u2019s ostensible nightmare scenario? Because it kind of is, but we\u2019re still talking about the former governor of Alaska here, and it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to be his running mate, really. Plus: wouldn\u2019t liberals kind of secretly LOVE it if Palin ran? Wouldn\u2019t Hillary Clinton\u2019s entire campaign team, which could take off the next 292 days? The real question before the dynamic duo even took the stage was: who does Palin bring in to Camp Trump that he doesn\u2019t already have? Palin, even for many conservatives, represents show(wo)manship over substance \u2013 and she isn\u2019t exactly respected on her policy merits. Or at least, that would be the question if Donald Trump\u2019s entire campaign weren\u2019t geared around maximizing his own press coverage in order to bump up his poll numbers. (You\u2019re reading this, aren\u2019t you?) Sarah Palin still drags the press (and especially the liberal press \u2013 guilty as charged) around by our collective noses. Where Trump and Palin go, so go the television cameras. And that\u2019s reason enough to bring her along the campaign trail, if not appoint her Interior Secretary in the Trump administration\u2019s first term."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
