And yet one should not go overboard about this. They were producing news products, not running the country. At times, however, it seems they came close. So one must wonder whether it can really be the case, as we are told, that someone was having a problem with a passport, and so they told a friend, who told a friend, who mentioned it to a pal at News International, who mentioned it to a well-connected reporter, who mentioned it to a politician \u2013 and suddenly all was well, because there no longer was a passport problem. It can't be the case, because that would lead one to believe that someone had much more clout than they should have had. And that would be extraordinary. \u2022 We need to know that sort of thing. But there is so much we need to know. Such as did home secretary Theresa May bring pressure to bear on the church authorities to take a tough line against the Occupy anti-capitalism campaigners in the precincts of St Paul's Cathedral? Did she stiffen the sinews when they seemed weak? Easy to believe now that the police have labelled the protesters as terrorists. We'd like to tell you, because on receiving info to that effect, we have asked \u2013 as did the Brighton Pavilion MP Caroline Lucas. She was told in the Commons that ministers and officials \"received regular updates\" and had \"discussions with the cathedral authorities\". But that's not necessarily pressure. So we asked the Home Office, did you lean on the church? The reply: \"we refuse to answer\". Still, the truth will out. Nobody likes a bully. \u2022 The truth will out, and who hasn't been enjoying the leaked email spat between Conservative MP Colonel Bob Stewart and Michael Fabricant, one of the Tory whips. Fabricant ordered the troops to get down to the Feltham and Heston byelection in west London. Stewart, while willing to do his bit, didn't care for Fabricant's tone or the whip's decision to communicate directly with MPs' staff. \"Who the hell do you think you are? I am furious. My staff do not work for the party and your email is thus illegal,\" Bob said. Having done his bit in Feltham, Col Bob dismissed the whole thing as a lost cause, the Tory campaign as a shambles \u2013 and he complained that those he encountered made him less than welcome. That's what happens, sometimes, blogs mischievous Labour man Paul Flynn. And Flynn, who takes no pleasure in Tory discomfort, has a tale about Peter Tatchell, then a would-be MP, trying to connect with a potential voter over the intercom. \"You can trust me. I come from round here,\" pleaded Tatchell. \"I wouldn't trust anyone who comes from round here,\" said the voter. \"Bugger off.\" \u2022 Tatchell well recalls that occasion. It occurred during his ill-fated attempt to do the right thing for the people of Bermondsey in the 1980s. A fascinating time, but voters rarely reacted as one might wish. \"I remember hearing an argument about me between two women in a supermarket,\" he tells us. \"One said, 'you know that Tatchell, he's a Marxist'. 'No he's not. He's Australian,' was the reply.\" \u2022 Finally, as Charlie Brooker's satire Black Mirror speculates about the kidnap of a princess, Richard Peppiatt, the man who blew the whistle on moral lapses at the Daily Star, reveals how he was once in position, if not to kidnap Princess Beatrice, then at least to touch the hem of her garment. It was 2008, and Princess Beatrice had enrolled at Goldsmiths in south London on a history of art and philosophy course. Peppiatt, a philosophy graduate from Warwick University who was working for Ferrari news agency, was able to use his journalism skills to learn of Beatrice's timetable from a tutor and then his philosophy skills to join her in all of her classes for a week. He even contributed to the seminars. Beatrice's protection officers never rumbled him, he told students at Coventry University the other day. Perhaps the royal guards nodded off at the mention of Plato and John Stuart Mill. Wonder what they think of Black Mirror?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
