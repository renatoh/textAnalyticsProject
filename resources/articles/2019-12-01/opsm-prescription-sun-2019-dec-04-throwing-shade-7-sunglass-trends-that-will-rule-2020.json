In a world where wild neon, retro oversized, and mirror-lensed sunglasses are high style, it\u2019s hard to fathom that there was a time, not long ago, when it was considered radical - and indulgent - to own more than one basic pair. Most folks, especially those needing a prescription, made a single purchase that was neutral-looking enough to match any outfit and any occasion. Fast forward to today and we\u2019re a nation of proud shades collectors, adventurous and among the quickest to adopt glasses trends - and for good reason. All the sinister things that the sun does to skin apply to vision, too. UV rays penetrate our eyes and cause cumulative damage, irreversible macular degeneration and even cataracts over time. But sunglasses\u2019 serious purpose doesn\u2019t mean they have to be subtle or boring, says Stewart Walton, vice president of product at optical giant Luxottica. \u201cNowadays sunglasses are an extension of a person\u2019s look, a representation of their personality, so we definitely see a lot more people buying multiple pairs at once,\u201d he says. We\u2019re also lucky, Walton says, that the strict standards in this country mean shopping from a high street retailer such as OPSM guarantees sunglasses are safe, no matter how adventurous they are. Advances in technology also mean almost all high street shades - 85% at OPSM, to be precise - can have a prescription added, too. \u201cOnce upon a time, the sunglass business in Australia was centred around Ray-Ban Aviators and Wayfarers, but now people are looking for evolutions of the classics, something with a twist, and interesting colours,\u201d Walton says. Here\u2019s the lowdown of the hottest shade trends for summer. Trend #1: Oversized retro \u201cThere have always been retro influences in our collections, but 1970s-inspired styles are a key trend for next year,\u201d Walton says. \u201cThis includes retro acetate frames, big squares, oversized ovals, and colours that are a more earthy, mottled and neutral. We\u2019re seeing more green lenses coming through, too.\u201d How to wear it: Earthy colours are almost universally flattering. Team with whites, creams and natural linens for a laid-back look. Expert tip: \u201cIf you want a prescription added, opt for slightly smaller lenses,\u201d Walton says. \u201cOversized frames can sometimes make adding a script a challenge.\u201d SHOP THE LOOK: Ray-Ban RB3561 ($229) and Tiffany Blue Entry ($430), stockist: opsm.com.au Prada PR 16RSF ($330) and Ralph Lauren RA5138 ($189.95), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #2: Adventurous This means everything from neon colours to mirrored glass and radical shapes. Just as the high-vis colours of the late \u201980s and early \u201990s have resurged on fashion runways, bright sunglasses now hot property. Case in point: the limited-edition Post Malone range created with Arnette for OPSM, which includes a bold yellow acetate frame. How to wear it: Tempting as it is to keep the rest of your outfit neutral for balance, this trend is best worn with a street-vibe look that also incorporates brights and prints. Expert tip: \u201cI have a rule of thumb,\u201d Walton says. \u201cHave a look at your face shape. Do you have a slightly round face shape or a more angular shape, fine jawline? What is it about your face that\u2019s the most defining quality? Then try to find a frame that\u2019s the opposite.\u201d SHOP THE LOOK: Oakley Frogskins ($174.95), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #3: Redefined metals \u201cMetals have traditionally been the poor cousin to plastic acetate, particularly in Europe, but there has been a real push over the past two years to do more interesting things with gold, silver, rose-gold, and even gunmetal grey materials,\u201d Walton says. How to wear it: Universally flattering, metal frames are among the easiest to wear, and are especially good teamed with a suited or formal look. Expert tip: Aviators are back with a twist - as prescription glasses. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone from something completely out of fashion to being extremely on trend,\u201d Walton says. \u201cAll the young guys in our office have been rocking aviator [prescription glasses] this year.\u201d SHOP THE LOOK: Ray-Ban Icons ($205), and Ralph Lauren ($189.95), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #4: Geometrics From triangles to straight edges pressed into ovals, this trend embraces angles and non-organic forms. Prada Sun\u2019s rounded frames with the deep V under the bridge are a more subtle interpretation. At the other end of the spectrum, Burberry\u2019s triangular style means business. How to wear it: Let your shades do the talking and team with a simple white shirt and classic jeans. Expert tip: Be mindful that coloured lenses can something affect safety when driving, Walton says. SHOP THE LOOK: Prada PR 04US ($460), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #5: Shield Another blast from the past, the full-wrap visor has been championed by celebrity aficionados of late. \u201cFor Australia this is a style really never went away, but now it\u2019s back with a vengeance and being reinvented in a cool and futuristic way,\u201d Walton says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely gone from something daggy to being at the height of cool.\u201d Sex and the City star and style icon Sarah Jessica Parker recently created a collection for Sunglass Hut centred around this shield shape. Likewise, Fendi\u2019s recent collab with rap star Nicki Minaj. How to wear it: The whole point of this trend is to go big and bold, but make sure the frame wraps snugly around your face so it doesn\u2019t feel awkward. Expert tip: \u201cThis is one of the only styles that isn\u2019t usually an option for prescriptions thanks to the single lens,\u201d Walton says. \u201cIn that case, consider asking your optometrist about contact lenses.\u201d SHOP THE LOOK: Versace ($279.95), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #6: Sports luxe This trend has legs that just keep on running, but next season brings a fresh direction. \u201cMirrored lenses have become a real focus for all sports brands,\u201d Walton says. \u201cA few years ago, it was mainly Oakley that you\u2019d see them in, but I think almost every brand now has a bright popping mirrored lens that really elevates a frame that could otherwise be conservative.\u201d How to wear it: Keep it casual. This is the ideal style for the beach or laid-back days off. Think shorts, relaxed T-shirts and, of course, sporting gear. Expert tip: The beauty of sports-centric frames is they tend to be unisex, which opens up your range of options, Walton says. SHOP THE LOOK: Oakley Batwolf ($254.95), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #7: Celebrity collaborations \u201cPost Malone wasn\u2019t an obvious fit for an optical partnership, but it has been fantastic for Arnette,\u201d Walton says, adding that these ranges tend to embrace trends. \u201cRay-Ban just did one with a DJ called Peggy Gou which had a built-in chain. Sunglass Hut has the SJP [Sarah Jessica Parker] partnership, which has a shield style that\u2019s a departure for someone like her.\u201d How to wear it: Your own way. Post Malone, Nicki and SJP would. Expert tip: Just as you would any other sunglasses purchase, make sure any celebrity-linked style makes note of meeting Australian safety standards on its packaging if it\u2019s not bought from a trusted retailer, Walton says.
