Speaking at the Edinburgh Television Festival last August, Evans appeared to be brimming with new ideas for captivating young viewers and his new show, Boys and Girls, will be the high-profile embodiment of all those promises. He has hailed the live show, produced by his new UMTV company, as 'unlike anything currently on UK screens'. It was originally to have been presented by Denise Van Outen, but she recently pulled out in order to perform in a West End revival of Tell Me on a Sunday . According to Channel 4, Boys and Girls 'won't be staid, but it won't be vulgar either'. Each week Evans will pitch 100 men against 100 women for a weekly prize of \u00a3100,000. Each episode will have a budget of \u00a3550,000. VT \u00b7 Boys and Girls starts in March 2 IPHIGENIA Edna O'Brien is taking on the Ancient Greeks. A first for her, and for the ever lively Crucible, where O'Brien's free adaptation of Iphigenia will open the spring season. Euripides' play, first produced in 410BC, is a version of the Abraham-Isaac story with a woman at the centre - the action hinges on whether or not Agamemnon will actually sacrifice his adored daughter - and this production has attracted an unusual concentration of female talent. The action will be choreographed by Scarlet Mackmin. The director is her sister, Anna, who has been experimenting by using local people in the Chorus, and who sees in O'Brien's adaptation a vein of simplicity, almost of domesticity running alongside an epic energy. Still, there's no chance that a strong male presence will be lacking at the centre. Lloyd Owen - who last year set the Royal Court smouldering with his gloriously rumbling bass voice in The York Realist - will play Agamemnon. SC \u00b7 Crucible, Sheffield (0114 249 6000), 5 February to 1 March. www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk 3 THE HOURS Stephen Daldry's new film The Hours has already captivated American critics and been selected by the National Board Review as the best film of 2002. It is thought to be a likely Oscar-winner. Virginia Woolf, played by Nicole Kidman - looking unusually predatory - wades into a river to the sound of her own voice reading aloud her suicide note/ thankyou letter to Leonard Woolf: 'You have given me the greatest possible happiness... ' In this film, based on Michael Cunningham's elegant Pulitzer-prize winning novel, happiness is always in the past tense. The Hours is a dark plait of biographical fact and imagination; it is, at no point, slavishly literary. Meryl Streep plays a charismatic, modern Mrs Dalloway, based in New York. Julianne Moore gives a sensitive performance as a depressed mother in a Fifties Los Angeles suburb, reading Mrs Dalloway as a self-help book. But one thing is sure, over here, the film will divide critical opinion - infuriate as well as dazzle. KK \u00b7 The Hours opens 14 February 4 BLUR: THE BOMB? Furtively issued white labels. Sojourns in Morocco and - for Damon Albarn - in Mali. Fatboy Slim at the helm, William Orbit in the mix. And of course, the protracted, unceremonious split with Graham Coxon, whose wiry guitar endoskeletons were surplus to requirements in Blur's new body of work. All these forces have shaped Blur's forthcoming seventh album, the first fruits of which are expected in the spring. It's easily the band's most controversial record, as the former Britpop band attempt to reposition themselves - once again - and regain ground as an important pop force. For now, they've been playing second fiddle to Damon Albarn's side-project, the wildly successful Gorillaz, whose cartoon club-savvy pop has undoubtedly fed into Blur's reservoir of new ideas. Rou\u00e9 bassist Alex James reckons the new album is 'the record of our lives'. Norman Cook hinted that it sounded like The Clash. Blur fans, meanwhile, weren't sure what to make of 'Don't Bomb When You're The Bomb', the first, mantric inkling of Blur's new sound. It's a title that could yet come back to haunt them. KE 5 SELFRIDGES, BIRMINGHAM Vittorio Radice, the man who gave Future Systems the biggest commission of their career so far, has already left Selfridges. But the store they designed for him, due to open later this year in Birmingham, is likely to turn out to be just the attention-grabbing gesture that made Marks and Spencer poach Radice. There is nothing quite like Future Systems' curvaceous tear-drop structure, covered in a skin of aluminium discs that look like fish scales. It's everything that the dismal grey Birmingham of the Sixties, pulled down to make way for this and a clutch of other redevelopments, wasn't. Department stores haven't been this interesting since the Twenties. DS 6 31 SONGS: NICK HORNBY This is an in-between novels book, a playlist from the author's record collection that finds him riffing on the pop singles that have stayed in his head. For all his gifts as a fiction writer, Hornby is, for me, still at his most persuasive as an essayist, and, as he explains his enduring love of Springsteen's 'Thunder Road' or Nelly Furtado's 'I'm Like a Bird', he discovers a more grown-up version of the voice of Fever Pitch: intimate, funny and wise. Hornby's prose works a little like the best of the songs he describes in that it locates a confessional poignancy that taps into universal emotions. He is, as such, one of very few writers who could mount a wholly convincing argument for the affective power of Rod Stewart, and perhaps the only one who could make you want to seek out early albums from the J. Geils Band (pre 'Centerfold'). TA \u00b7 31 Songs is published on 27 February by Penguin 7 THE SAATCHI GALLERY Need you be reminded? This event has been in the air for a long, long time, puffed up by rumour and the gaseous hype of media surmise. The facts are simple enough. Charles Saatchi vacated his gallery in London's Boundary Road last year, moving temporarily to N1. The shows became more intermittent until they dwindled away, leading some to speculate, quite against the evidence of continuing purchasing rounds, that Saatchi had forgotten art in his love for Nigella. But now - or at least some time in spring, nobody is very clear - some of Saatchi's collection will join the elaborate fairground by the river at County Hall, another ride between the Eye, the Aquarium and the Dali Universe and before the Coke and the burgers. Expect the shark, the bed, the dung and so forth, but also new shows by younger artists than the veteran YBAs. Also expect to get in at any time. Unlike the twin Tates, between which it neatly positions itself, this gallery will be open practically 24/7. It only closes during the uncommercial small hours of the night. LC \u00b7 County Hall, London SE1, opening in April. 8 CAMBRIDGE SPIES Following the popular success of Spooks, the BBC is to return to the subject of British spies and spying. This time, though, the approach is rather more sober and, crucially, the spies in question turn out to be working for 'them' and not us. Samuel West plays Anthony Blunt, the KGB talent scout who picked out likely looking traitors and then went on to become surveyor of the Queen's pictures. Toby Stephens, most recently spotted cavorting with James Bond in Die Another Day, will play Kim Philby, the man who became head of anti-communist counter-espionage, and Tom Hollander will be Guy Burgess, with Rupert Penry-Jones as Donald Maclean. Peter Moffat's script concentrates on the friendships and political passions at the centre of their betrayals of Britain. He has said: 'This is the story of four young but devastatingly effective double-agents who knew from the start that they stood or fell together.' VT \u00b7 Cambridge Spies will be broadcast on BBC2 in the spring 9 CHARLIE KAUFMAN 'One of these days, the term Kaufmanesque will be just as familiar in Hollywood as Mametspeak,' George Clooney said recently. Clooney has a vested interest, having directed Kaufman's latest screenplay, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, but the screenwriter has a unique voice. His first screenplay, Being John Malkovich, was a Warholian fantasy that defied categorisation. Kaufman himself shuns the spotlight. He rarely gives interviews and refuses to be photographed. Now he has written two more films. In Adaptation (which is, like Being John Malkovich, directed by Spike Jonze), Nicolas Cage plays the fictional Charlie Kaufman, a neurotic writer working on a screenplay of Susan Orlean's non-fiction book The Orchid Thief about a maverick flower breeder. Kaufman, naturally enough, got the idea while struggling to adapt Orlean's bestseller himself. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is the biopic of Chuck Barris, game-show host and self-professed CIA hitman. 'I never start with a real plan,' Kaufman has said. 'I start with ideas that are interesting to me, and I kind of marry them.' AO \u00b7 Adaptation opens on 28 February, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind on 14 March 10 THE ROCK RENAISSANCE, PART II Loud American bands look set to continue making ears ring well into 2003, with the release of a handful of long-awaited records. Detroit's White Stripes have a fourth album of gritty punk blues ready to go in March, called Elephant, recorded in an all-valve studio in London's glamorous borough of Hackney last year. Meanwhile, across the water, a second wave of New York bands is now emerging, bleary-eyed and sweaty, from the clubs of Williamsburgh. Most unmissable of these is The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, a female-fronted trio whose debut long-player drops in March, preceded by a single and UK dates in February. The Yeah Yeah Yeahs' raucous, danceable punk will segue nicely into The Rapture's even more danceable, punk-funk outing, expected in the spring. Garage rock's golden boys, The Strokes, are in the studio as you read this, and will continue to be well into the spring. They should finally release their feverishly awaited follow-up to Is This It towards the end of next year. Only time will tell whether The Strokes' offhand charm will be affected by their superstardom. KE 11 SECOND COMING Having shocked and entertained the nation with Channel 4's influential Queer as Folk, writer Russell T. Davies now focuses his talent for dangerous drama on the subject of religious belief. Second Coming, a two-part thriller commissioned by ITV, will star Christopher Eccleston as Steve Baxter, 'an ordinary lad from Salford who has nice mates, no girlfriend and is also the son of God and can perform miracles'. At midnight on his birthday, Steve goes missing for 40 days and 40 nights and is found roaming the Yorkshire Moors, convinced of his status as the son of God. To convince unbelievers he is forced to perform a series of miracles. Davies, who provoked 163 complaints to the Independent Television Commission after bringing to our screens the seduction of a 15-year-old boy by a 29-year-old man, is expecting more trouble. 'This is going to be one hell of a ride for viewers,' he has said. VT \u00b7 Second Coming starts in February 12 WYNTON MARSALIS Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra will be touring Britain for two weeks in January, with a programme called 'Rhythm Is Our Business', featuring the music of Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Woody Herman. Marsalis is a controversial figure, because of the power he wields as director of the Lincoln Center's jazz programme and his candidly expressed dislike for much contemporary jazz. But his brilliance, as both trumpet player and bandleader, is unquestionable. Marsalis and band members will give master classes and special concerts for schools throughout the tour. The LCJO is the only jazz outfit to travel with a full-time education officer. DG \u00b7 www.jazzatlincolncenter.org 13 CAMILLE The coughing courtesan memorialised in 1848 by Alexandre Dumas fils will be radically reimagined this spring, when Daniela (This Life) Nardini stars in Neil Bartlett's new version of La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias. The director will be David McVicar, hot from operatic feats. Bartlett emphasises that this is 'not La Traviata'. There will be no terminal sweetener: the heroine will 'die alone, without redemption'; Dumas wrote the original novel - 'in a state of traumatic obsession' - only months after the real-life model for his consumptive heroine had died. For Bartlett, the play poses the question of 'how you can own yourself': as a prostitute; as someone with a terminal disease; as someone who has fallen in love. Nardini's sceptical intelligence should play interestingly against any notion of flowery effusion. She has worked with McVicar before, and said yes to the part before a word had been written. SC \u00b7 Lyric Hammersmith, London W6 (020 8741 2311), 6 March to 12 April, then touring nationally until 24 May. www.lyric.co.uk 14 COLD FEET The fifth and final series of the successful drama series will be shown on ITV early this year. After a disappointing end to series four, which culminated in what can only be described as an Australian fantasy sequence - lots of sun, skinny dipping and unlikely couplings - the cast return to Manchester to tie up loose ends. The rumour mill is busy churning out whispers that a number of different endings have been filmed, and that any one of the main characters could be in for a tragic death. Either way, it's going to be a Kleenex fest. HL \u00b7 Cold Feet starts in February 15 GEORGE PIPER DANCES The modern ballet ensemble founded by ex-Royal Ballet Boyz Michael Nunn and William Trevitt - called after their middle names - has been going from strength to strength. Their risky venture has drawn audiences all over Britain. They've carried on filming their video diaries, first shown on Channel 4, framing their programmes with in-your-face shots of themselves backstage. Their latest venture is a 45-minute compilation of pieces made for them by different choreographers. They've commissioned the hottest names around: Matthew Bourne, Akram Khan, Russell Maliphant and Christopher Wheeldon. Cheekily titled Critics' Choice *****, the collage will be linked by video interviews with the choreographers and rehearsal footage. The new work will be joined by other additions to their growing repertoire, including Matthew Hart's Other People's Wives. JP \u00b7 World premiere, Queen Elizabeth Hall, London SE1 (020 7960 4242), 25-29 March, then on tour. www.rfh.org.uk 16 THE TROJANS AND THE HANDMAID'S TALE English National Opera hopes to have chosen a new artistic director, and survived the umpteenth stage of the Coliseum's renovation, before restoring its good name this year with a series of bold ventures. Before the autumn's completion of its slowly unfolding Ring Cycle, Richard Jones will direct a two-part production of Berlioz's The Trojans in January and May, and April sees the UK premiere of Danish composer Poul Ruders's opera from Margaret Atwood's novel The Handmaid's Tale. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, and conducted by Elgar Howarth, Atwood's vision of oppressed womankind in a fundamentalist, post-coup United States stars the Canadian mezzo Stephanie Marshall as the title character Offred, leader of the resistance. AH \u00b7 The Coliseum, London WC2 (020 7632 8300). Part 1 of The Trojans begins on 27 January. www.eno.org 17 ART DECO 1910-1939 The V&amp;A struck gold with its exhibition 'Art Nouveau' in 2000 and is now promising an equally spectacular sequel. Art Deco - the name comes from the 1925 Paris Exposition des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes - is not just the glitzy cocktail look of Poirot and Schiaperelli. It owed something to avant-garde art: the machine forms of Constructivism, the wild colours of Fauvism. It has even been called 'Cubism tamed'. This colossal show will trace its roots back to painting and sculpture with works by Leger, Delaunay, Brancusi and others. Highlights include the entire foyer of the Strand Palace Hotel, newly reconstructed; dozens of items from the original 1925 show; films, posters, textiles, furniture and of course the slinky fashion and jewellery that sold Deco as the international luxury style of the Thirties. LC \u00b7 V&amp;A, London SW7, 27 March - 20 July. 18 INGMAR BERGMAN The first heavyweight film event of 2003 is the two-month definitive Ingmar Bergman season which has just started at the NFT, and will subsequently tour the regions. Arguably the greatest living artist, Bergman's career covers nearly 60 years. Born in 1918, the son of a stern Lutheran pastor, he grew up tormented by sexual guilt, obsessed by the Protestant work ethic and oppressed by conflicting notions of salvation. The stage continues to be his first love and he progressed to heading Sweden's National Theatre, where he still works in his eighties, while writing screenplays for others to direct. 'The theatre is my wife, the cinema's my mistress,' he has often said. On stage he has directed Shakespeare, Ibsen, Moli\u00e8re, Tennessee Williams and, above all, Strindberg. In the cinema, he has invariably worked on his own screenplays, absorbing influences from German Expressionism, prewar French poetic realism, and postwar Italian neo-realism, before finding his individual style. It was his dramatisation of mid-century spiritual struggles that got him onto the cover of Time, not his box-office success. His first film, Crisis (1945) was dour and none-too-promising; his final feature, Fanny and Alexander , is sublime. 'I'm the sum of everything I've read, seen, heard and experienced,' he once wrote. PF \u00b7 National Film Theatre, London SE1, until 28 Feb. 020 7928 3232. www.bfi.org.uk 19 FAR FROM HEAVEN In a climate of apparently unstoppable remakes, Todd Haynes (director of 1995's Safe, and the less appreciated Velvet Goldmine) has avoided the obvious, and paid homage to a great director of the Fifties while making a film that is entirely his own. Far From Heaven, certain to be one of the best films of the coming year, takes as the inspiration for its plot Douglas Sirk's 1955 Hollywood melodrama All That Heaven Allows, but it also revives Sirk's style and preoccupations in general. In that film, a middle-class American mother played by Jane Wyman falls in love with her gardener, Rock Hudson, and eventually breaks off the affair to spare her children the shame of her social crime. Here, Julianne Moore, right, is Cathy, a chirpy Fifties housewife admired by her neighbours until cracks begin to show. Her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid), succumbs to his desire to sleep with men, and in the manner of the times, they force themselves to imagine this is a curable disease. Psychiatric treatment does not go well; Cathy's husband drinks and becomes violent. She has no one to talk to about her predicament, but she feels happy in the company of her new black gardener (Dennis Haysbert). This, however, turns out to be as complex a problem as the situation with her husband. When Frank leaves her for a younger man, she faces the fall-out of her own actions: the gardener's daughter is attacked; her children have a terrible time at school; friends desert her. Haynes has added the gay plot and the inter-racial romance, but it's well within Sirk's sensibility. After all, there was racial tension in his 1958 movie Imitation of Life, and perhaps Haynes might argue that the casting of Rock Hudson in All That Heaven Allows left later viewers with a different sense of the gender issues at stake. More than anything, though, what Haynes has beautifully reconstructed is the way in which Sirk's morality functions. The luscious colours, the glorious music, the swirly lettering in the title sequence and Moore's sickly-sweet demeanour will have viewers laughing with glee at the camp artificiality. But it is not mere kitsch - it is a metaphor for the hypocrisy of the times. Underneath it, human difficulty or passion is never quelled, and the tweeness only reinforces the fact that there is no way to negotiate, discuss or accept it. 'Do you really think you can see beneath the surface of things?' Cathy asks the gardener when they are in the throes of a city-wide snub. This question, more than any other, epitomises Sirk's, and now Haynes's film: how what lies beneath the surface always slips out horribly, heartbreakingly, from its conventional hiding place. Sirk was thought to be a maker of 'women's films', but what's special about them is that they are never what they seem to be. He was a friend and contemporary of Brecht, and in his work artificiality has a purpose - it's a form of 'alienation' dressed in fashionable, wealthy clothes. GW \u00b7 Far From Heaven opens on 7 March 20 MAX BECKMANN Max Beckmann is a dark and knotted figure, an unflinchingly urgent witness to history and one of Germany's greatest twentieth-century painters. Born in Leipzig, he settled in Berlin in 1904 and might have made a career as an old-fashioned Expressionist had he not seen action in the trenches. The work he produced after his breakdown in 1915 entered directly into a gas-lit world of fear, disappointment, debauchery and pain - postwar Berlin, dense and claustrophobic, as if viewed in terms of late-medieval sculpture. This show comes from the same collaborative team that brought us the stupendously successful 'Matisse/Picasso' at Tate Modern last year. The range of works is superb - including rarely seen masterpieces such as Self Portrait in a Tuxedo and his key Departure triptych from 1932. Beckmann is a bitter taste to acquire, but a deeply original thinker. This show looks set to be definitive. LC \u00b7 Tate Modern, London SE1, 13 February - 5 May. www.tate.org.uk 21 MODELS WRITING BOOKS 'The sort of self-indulgent book you can read on a melancholic Sunday afternoon swaddled in blankets' is how Sophie Dahl wants her first novel to be received. We'll have to wait to find out if Sophie has inherited grandfather Roald's talent and whether she can do better than Naomi Campbell did with her flopbuster Swan back in 1995. Also stepping off the catwalk is Christy Turlington, in whose 276-page informative tome there are 44 photos of the supermodel. She's not wearing Armani or fur, either - and her credibility goes up accordingly. Beautifully presented, and with plenty of personal anecdotes, any self-respecting coffee table should have one. KdG \u00b7 Sophie Dahl's The Man With the Dancing Eyes is published on 14 February. Christy Turlington's Living Yoga: Creating a Life Practice is published on 27 March 22 COURTNEY LOVE: OUT, OUT, DAMN RECORD Late last year, the long-running dis pute over Nirvana's legacy was resolved, as was the legal battle over Love's own recording contract with Geffen. So in 2003, Courtney Love, the widow/litigant/film star, will revert to a previous role, singer/ guitarist, with the release of her much-anticipated debut solo album. After a false start when her all-girl punk project Bastard faltered, the as-yet untitled album will mark Love's first recorded output since Hole's final record, 1998's Celebrity Skin. Although details of the release have yet to be inked in, there will be a single early in the year on former Creation boss Alan McGee's Poptones label, with an album to follow, possibly also on Poptones. Reports from a live show last year witnessed Love's sound taking a heavy, garage rock turn, although the creative presence of Pink's co-songwriter Linda Perry suggests the new material could have a glossier, soft rock sheen. Whatever, La Love will lay down her guitar again for a spell this spring to take on the role of Lady Macbeth for director Luc Besson. KE 23 TITIAN EXHIBITION There has never been a show quite like this and there certainly won't be another in our lifetime, because this is the first major survey of Titian's work ever held in this country. Masterpieces will arrive from all over the globe, no expense spared, including the fabulous Flora from Florence and Dana\u00eb from Naples. If you are able to get to only a single exhibition this spring, make it this one. Tiziano Vecellio, better know as Titian, was more famous and admired than any other artist of his era. Born in about 1488, in a northern Italian hill town, he died of the plague in his Venetian palazzo, still painting at almost 90 years of age. Not even Michelangelo achieved Titian's international renown. His patrons included doges, popes and crowned heads of Europe. The story of the Holy Roman Emperor stooping to retrieve one of Titian's brushes from the floor may be a little far-fetched, but it epitomises the universal reverence for this 'painter of kings and king among painters'. Titian's immensely long career is one of constant, unflagging development - from the early paintings, inspired by Giorgione, to the late impressionistic works, so moving to the modern eye. But his art is never less than spectacularly fluid and inventive, grand in its ambition and in its emotional drama. His portraits may not be the first to investigate the mind and heart of the sitter, but his observation of the internal personality within the outer facade was unrivalled, although everywhere imitated throughout Europe. The National Gallery already owns some of Titian's greatest early works, including Bacchus and Ariadne and that most glamorous of intellectuals, Man with the Blue Sleeve. He will be joined by some of the master-portraits of the middle years - Clarissa Strozzi, Ranuccio Farnese and the piercingly sly face of Pope Paul III - along with landscapes, religious paintings and classical allegories. It is often said that Titian transformed the language of painting. This is an unprecedented chance to witness the proof, especially in the late works, with their radically broken and expressive brushwork. The climax of this show will bring together some of Titian's last and most devastating images: Diana and Actaeon, Tarquin and Lucretia and The Entombment, never before moved from the Prado. LC \u00b7 National Gallery, London WC2; 19 February-18 May 24 WAGNER'S RING CYCLE To mark its fortieth birthday, Scottish Opera will complete a much-praised new version of Wagner's Ring Cycle, its first since the Alexander Gibson era 30 years ago, masterfully directed by Tim Albery and conducted by Richard Armstrong. The fourth and last instalment, G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung , will be unveiled in Edinburgh in April, prior to two complete cycles at the Edinburgh Festival in August, two in Glasgow in September and one in Manchester - at The Lowry, Salford Quays - in October. Graham Sanders's Siegfried, Elizabeth Byrne's Br\u00fcnnhilde and Matthew Best's Wotan lead a fine cast in what promises to be one of the musical events of 2003. AH \u00b7 Theatre Royal, Glasgow (0141 332 9000). www.scottishopera.org.uk 25 40 Good news for anyone who has waved goodbye to their twenties and thirties: primetime television drama looks as if it is about to grow up. Both Channel 4 and ITV1 are planning major new series next year revolving around people in - gosh - their forties. And BBC2 seems to be aiming to follow suit: controller Jane Root said recently that she didn't want any more dramas featuring 'thirtysomethings who get off with each other'. It looks as though we'll now be watching fortysomethings get off with each other instead, because C4's 40 and, in the coming year, ITV's Life Begins and Single all seem to be fairly preoccupied by sex. Life Begins, written by the creator of Cold Feet and - not surprisingly - being touted by ITV as ' Cold Feet for fortysomethings', centres on a mother of two in her forties, played by Caroline Quentin, who starts dating again after her husband walks out. Single features another 40-year-old, played by Michelle Collins, who also finds herself back in the dating game when her relationship ends after 20 years. Then there is 40, which is produced by the team behind White Teeth and has a starry cast led by Eddie Izzard, Joanne Whalley, Hugo Speer and Kerry Fox. It is about a group of friends whose lives are 'linked by their hidden sexual and emotional secrets'.
