The Chinese once even made a habit of handing out giant pandas. When he visited the Vatican last month, Silvio Berlusconi gave the Pope a crucifix, which was tactful (if perhaps a little less than wholly necessary). But what on earth do you give Berlusconi himself? Italy's prime minister is also its richest man. He has a palazzo in Rome and villas on Sardinia and outside Milan. He even has his own minstrel, a former Neapolitan restaurant entertainer who occasionally sings at dinner for his guests. How do you find a gift for such a man? This was the conundrum that faced Said Wilbert Musa when he visited Rome for talks last month. But not for nothing is Said Wilbert Musa the leader of his people. The website of the government of the Central American republic of Belize (formerly British Honduras) gets it about right when it calls him \"the archetype of Kipling's man. He can walk among kings, but still keep the common touch.\" Mr Musa decided to confer on his Italian counterpart the one thing he cannot buy - immortality. During his stay in Rome, according to the Italian magazine Chi, Mr Musa announced to his Italian counterpart that he was naming an island after him. Some, particularly in the Italian judiciary, will find it only too appropriate that Mr Berlusconi, who once again faces trial for his allegedly illegal use of offshore companies, should have his name live on as an integral part of a noted offshore haven. Preliminary hearings are currently being held to examine charges that the prime minister used Caribbean island \"shell companies\", though not in Belize, to defraud the Italian taxpayer and embezzle the holders of shares in his TV group, Mediaset. At all events, Mr Berlusconi's office refused either to confirm or deny the report. \"At the moment, there is no comment,\" a spokesman told the Guardian on Friday evening. Chi said the island was currently called Blackbirds and would, in future, be known as \"Silvio Bay\", which is almost certainly a mishearing of Caye, the word used for small, sandy islands both in Belize and other parts of the Caribbean. The only Blackbird Caye the Guardian was able to trace in Belize belongs to an American tourist resort whose representatives sounded bemused at the prospect of being caught up in high-level international diplomacy. \"I suppose anything's possible,\" said a spokesman at the resort's US office. \"But I certainly haven't heard anything about this.\" Chi (which, just to make matters more complicated, is pronounced exactly like Caye), described Silvio Bay as a \"little paradise\". Too small to be seen on most maps, it formed part of a long coral reef that ran north to south along the coast of Belize. Was that an accurate description of the island in question? The resort's spokesman acknowledged uneasily that it was. But then he added: \"There may be another Blackbird Caye. Belize is fairly notorious for giving the same names to different islands. It could be that the prime minister has hit upon a politically expedient way of eliminating some duplicate names.\" Once again, the website of the government of Belize hits the nail on the very head. Said Wilbert Musa, it says, is \"a man of vision\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
