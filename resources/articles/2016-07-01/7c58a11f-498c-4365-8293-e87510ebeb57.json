The monthly survey of high street and online sales from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG found that sales in the second quarter of 2016 were up 0.5% on the first quarter and 1.2% up on an annual basis. The BRC said this was the weakest performance since May 2009, when the economy was contracting during its longest and deepest postwar recessions. In June alone, total sales were 0.2% higher than in the same month last year, but were 0.5% lower on a like-for-like basis, which takes account of increased retail capacity over the past 12 months. David McCorquodale of KPMG said: \u201cAs consumer attention shifted indoors to escape autumnal downpours, furniture and home accessories bounced back in the month, with bigger-ticket items proving relatively resilient in the days immediately following the EU referendum. \u201cWith May sunshine a distant memory, however, summer wardrobes remained bare as sales of women\u2019s fashion and footwear plummeted following one of the wettest and dullest starts to a UK summer since records began.\u201d A separate report from the British Chambers of Commerce showed that companies were finding business conditions tough even before the result of the 23 June vote led to heightened anxiety about the outlook for the economy. In its quarterly report, the BCC reported that weakening domestic and overseas sales for the services sector and continuing poor performance by manufacturing would have required action from the government even had the UK voted to remain in the EU. Adam Marshall, BCC acting director general, said: \u201cEven before the EU referendum, both business confidence and economic growth were softening in many parts of the UK. Our latest survey results, captured just before the vote, suggest that many businesses have been operating in something of a holding pattern for some time.\u201d Marshall said it was too early to say what impact the leave vote had had on most firms, with only anecdotal evidence from those facing a more challenging environment and those seizing new opportunities. He added: \u201cAt a time of transition, all the businesses I speak to want Westminster to lead by example \u2013 by making bold decisions to progress key infrastructure and construction projects, by guaranteeing that EU workers can stay in British firms, and by seeking the best possible future terms of trade for the UK.\u201d Speaking before Theresa May was announced as the next prime minister, Marshall said: \u201cBusiness confidence would be buoyed by strong and clear leadership, both on the timeline for EU negotiations and on the big decisions unrelated to our future relationship with the EU.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
