In a strongly worded statement, MLB said Turner \u201cemphatically refused to comply\u201d with coronavirus protocols and \u201cput everyone he came in contact with at risk\u201d. \u201cImmediately upon receiving notice from the laboratory of a positive test, protocols were triggered, leading to the removal of Justin Turner from last night\u2019s game,\u201d the statement read. \u201cTurner was placed into isolation for the safety of those around him. However, following the Dodgers\u2019 victory, it is clear that Turner chose to disregard the agreed-upon joint protocols and the instructions he was given regarding the safety and protection of others. \u201cWhile a desire to celebrate is understandable, Turner\u2019s decision to leave isolation and enter the field was wrong and put everyone he came in contact with at risk. When MLB Security raised the matter of being on the field with Turner, he emphatically refused to comply.\u201d Turner was removed from the field during the eighth inning of the Dodgers\u2019 3-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays and placed in isolation after MLB said it learned mid-game that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, which has ravaged the United States and claimed more than 220,000 lives across the country. The 35-year-old returned to the field after the win, offering hugs in the dugout, posing with the Commissioner\u2019s Trophy and removing his mask next to manager Dave Roberts, who was diagnosed in 2010 with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a form of cancer that develops within the immune system of the body. \u201cThanks to everyone reaching out!,\u201d Turner said on Twitter. \u201cI feel great, no symptoms at all. Just experienced every emotion you can possibly imagine. Can\u2019t believe I couldn\u2019t be out there to celebrate with my guys! So proud of this team &amp; unbelievably happy for the City of LA.\u201d MLB said it was opening an investigation into the incident. It was not immediately clear what, if any, disciplinary action Turner or his team would face. \u201cLast night, nasal swabs were conducted on the Dodgers\u2019 traveling party,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBoth the Rays and Dodgers were tested again today and their travel back to their home cities will be determined after being approved by the appropriate authorities.\u201d The World Series capped a truncated and tumultuous season for MLB, which put its schedule on hold for weeks due to the pandemic and had numerous players and support staff test positive for Covid-19 after games started in July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
