The Pains of Being Pure at Heart opt to adapt, drafting in producer Flood and mixer Alan Moulder to polish and shine their second album. They nearly succeed: the title track is a valiant attempt at recreating My Bloody Valentine's eureka moment, when four-chord thrash suddenly became something odder and more interesting. Even In Dreams has the palm-muted guitar throb and keyboard washes of AM guitar pop before the wall of sound crashes in on the chorus. But Kip Berman's voice \u2013 breathy if you're kind, weedy if you're not \u2013 isn't actually suited to much other than fey jangling, and acts as a brake on the group's ambitions throughout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
