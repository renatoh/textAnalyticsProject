As he has pushed for the club to be more self-sufficient in recent years, the work done by Roberto Mart\u00ednez over the past three seasons is all the more remarkable. But after a summer that saw him ridiculed \u2013 with even Liverpool's managing director, Ian Ayre, branding him a \"comedian\" \u2013 for speaking publicly about other clubs, including Liverpool and Tottenham, pursuing Mart\u00ednez, Whelan, who pondered the idea of passing control over to his grandson a year ago, showed his interest and desire have not wavered. Mart\u00ednez had put months into a deal to sign the defender Iv\u00e1n Ramis from Real Mallorca and when he found that West Ham had lodged a higher bid, Whelan dipped into his own pocket and even travelled to Spain to ensure the \u00a33m transfer went through. After a chastening experience, which saw Ramis responsible for his new team conceding two goals in the first eight minutes of the 2-0 defeat to Chelsea on the opening weekend, the 28-year-old underlined his emergence as a force in English football with a powerful volley to set Wigan on their way against West Ham. Mart\u00ednez, who jokingly dismissed Sam Allardyce's claim that his Spanish connection made the difference in signing Ramis by restating his own Catalan roots, feels indebted to Whelan. \"We couldn't match the valuation of what West Ham agreed with Mallorca and [until] the chairman found the money we didn't have at the football club, that moment is a worry that you feel you're going to lose the player,\" Mart\u00ednez said. \"But the chairman knew how much we wanted to get the player and he allowed us to match the price. I don't know how big his pockets are but they were big enough on this occasion. Being a football man makes a big difference. He went over to Mallorca and he was really influential in the deal. \"[Ramis] is developing his communication skills quickly and he's a leader. It's a really important signing for us. He's been one of the best defenders in Spain for three or four years.\" Wigan's run of seven wins in nine, which included victories against Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle that took Mart\u00ednez's side to safety last season, had begun to seem like a distant memory. But after the opener from Ramis and a goal from the Scotland midfielder James McArthur, who drove in from Shaun Maloney's lay-off, earned a first home win of the season, West Ham's James Tomkins headed in from George McCartney's cross in added time. \"Everyone thinks we're going to be down there and we want to prove those people wrong,\" McArthur said. \"We want to win as many games as possible \u2013 and fast too \u2013 to get ourselves away from trouble.\" After a fine start to the campaign, West Ham now face a run of matches running into December that includes games against Manchester City, Newcastle, Tottenham, Manchester United and Chelsea. While Allardyce insisted the match officials played no part in his team's defeat, he believes Andy Carroll, who is still looking for a first goal since joining from Liverpool, could receive better protection. \"Referees aren't giving him enough free kicks when he is manhandled by central defenders who, let's face it, are having a difficult job coping with the quality that he's got,\" Allardyce said.
