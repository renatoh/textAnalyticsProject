In the past three months, over 50 hospital emergency rooms across France have held strike action with doctors and health workers complaining of funding cuts, a government reduction in the number of beds and a serious lack of medical staff leading to dire working conditions for emergency room staff. Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency room doctor in Bobigny north of Paris, and a health representative for the leftwing CGT union, said: \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve watched the cuts to the National Health Service in the UK \u2013 the NHS can be strangled fast by a government because it\u2019s funded by general taxes, while in France it\u2019s harder because of funding from specific social security payments. But while we have resisted for years, cuts in France now mean our system is collapsing. There is a lack of personnel. To save money, the government is reducing the number of beds and the number of doctors. There have been deaths because of it.\u201d He warned: \u201cOver the past 20 years, little by little, I\u2019ve seen the breaking of our health system. We have a very good system, but if these cuts continue, we\u2019ll be joining the misery of the NHS and I fear people who need treatment won\u2019t get treated.\u201d Linda Pillon, an emergency room nurse at a hospital in Toulon in the south, said: \u201cOur health system was among the best in the world, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s collapsing. Today we\u2019re fighting to stop that.\u201d With an acute shortage of local community doctors in many rural areas as well as in small towns, France\u2019s hospital-centred system is seeing emergency rooms increasingly called upon by a growing population. Staff say they are facing burnout and patients are at risk from the crisis in understaffing. The centrist French president, Emmanuel Macron, has acknowledged that hospitals are struggling due to the lack of general doctors in rural areas, and the closures of clinics, as well as budget constraints. He said last year in a speech on the future of healthcare: \u201cWithout changes, the hospital system will collapse. We need to rethink how we organise healthcare for the next 50 years.\u201d The health minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn \u2013 herself a former hospital doctor \u2013 is presenting a new healthcare policy to parliament this month arguing for streamlining of hospital management as well as general care, and promising to renovate dilapidated hospital emergency room buildings and offer more bonuses. She said: \u201cWe have to respond to the emergency in areas that feel abandoned.\u201d But healthcare unions berated her for criticising some emergency room staff in Paris when they recently called in sick as a form of protest. Unions are calling for an end to budget cuts and an end to the policy of reducing the number of beds. They say there must be an immediate recruitment drive for nurses. Abdel Dougha, is a healthcare assistant who works nights in the emergency room as Paris\u2019s Saint-Antoine hospital, which has seen continual strike action since March. \u201cThere needs to be a recognition of what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is only just starting to listen when we\u2019ve been alerting them to this crisis for so long.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
