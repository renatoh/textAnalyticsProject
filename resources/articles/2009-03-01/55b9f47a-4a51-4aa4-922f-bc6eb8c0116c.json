City investors will vote on the pay policies of Royal Bank of Scotland at the shareholders' annual meeting. In an unusual situation, major institutions appear to be shaping up to show their anger at the payout, but UK Financial Investments, the body established to manage the government's stake in RBS, does not appear ready to vote against it. The taxpayer could end up owning up to 95% of the bank. The Association of British Insurers (ABI), whose members own 20% of the stockmarket, is warning that the decision by the RBS board to double Goodwin's pension pot when he was ousted in October was a \"bad one\". It has issued an alert to its members to signal areas of concern. Investors have three choices at annual meetings. They can vote in favour of the remuneration report, vote against it or abstain to register a protest rather than cause unnecessary management disruption. Investors, however, are powerless to force the board to stop paying Goodwin's pension, although a vote against would register a powerful protest. Pirc, a body that advises local authority pension funds on how to vote, is recommending a vote against the remuneration report. However, it is understood UKFI is considering voting in favour even though public opinion is against the pension payout and UKFI itself is considering ways to recoup the pension deal from Goodwin. The vote comes at a crucial time for the major institutions which have been under fire from government ministers, particularly City minister Lord Myners, for failing to police banks' boardrooms. He has suggested they failed in \"examining and approving compensation culture\". It is the first time traditional City investors will vote alongside UKFI, which is run at arm's length from the Treasury. The government will argue that it has no influence over how the vote is cast. The ABI would ordinarily have given the remuneration report a \"red top\" to alert investors to the most serious breaches of best boardroom standards. But the investor body is also aware that the old management has left, to be replaced by chief executive Stephen Hester and chairman Sir Philip Hampton. Peter Montagnon, head of investment affairs at the ABI, said: \"The decision on Sir Fred Goodwin's pension was a bad one which would normally have warranted a red top. However, the remuneration committee which made that decision has now largely departed and the company has changed its policy with regard to the abatement of pension for directors who retire early. To have red-topped on this occasion might seem unfair criticism of the present board which is now substantially different.\" UKFI refused to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
