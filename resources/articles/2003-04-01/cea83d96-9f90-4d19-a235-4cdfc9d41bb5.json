Nato's sole Muslim member was never for this war, but the sight of US-led Kurdish fighters advancing towards the oil-rich cities of Kirkuk and Mosul is now filling its leaders with dread. This, they say, is beginning to look like Ankara's worst nightmare: US-supported Kurdish peshmerga guerrillas grabbing the two hubs of northern Iraq that could bankroll their quest for statehood. If achieved, the logic goes, such conquests would automatically threaten Turkey's own territorial integrity by rekindling Kurdish armed separatism in the badlands of Turkey's remote south-east. And, now, as if that were not enough, Turkish Kurd rebels who sought sanctuary in northern Iraq at the end of the brutal 15-year separatist campaign, have reappeared with an unsavoury announcement. From now on, they say, they will exploit US anger over Ankara's refusal to allow US troops to use Turkey as a \"northern front\" in the current battle to oust Saddam Hussein to overtly push for more cultural and political freedoms. \"With the war in Iraq a new situation has emerged,\" declared Osman Ocalan, a senior commander in the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which struggled against Turkey until his brother, the captured rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, called for a ceasefire four years ago. \"Before, US ties with Turkey were of the highest strategic importance; after Israel it was the country they trusted most in the Middle East. There has now been a serious setback.\" Worryingly, tensions along the Turkish-Iraq border worsened this week amid accusations that Turkish troops had deliberately fired shells on villages and farmland in northern Iraq. For although - under US pressure - Kurdish leaders in Iraq have sought to play down any desire for self-determination, the prospect of a post-war settlement further entrenching the autonomy they enjoy is making Turks increasingly edgy. The Kurds - as many as 25 million people spread across Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria - are said to be the world's largest stateless nation. Ever since the collapse of promises to establish an independent Kurdistan after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Kurds have dreamed of a homeland. Since the end of the first Gulf war, the three and a half million who live in Iraq have achieved what none of their brothers have managed so far: administering themselves in areas beyond Baghdad's control. But while the experiment in self-rule has been a success story - producing the sort of freedom, prosperity and democracy that are the envy of Kurds elsewhere - it has never had the imprimatur of UN recognition. Kurdish autonomy, protected under the Anglo-US \"no fly zone\", remained de facto not least because Iraq's three northern territories were never ceded by Saddam Hussein. To attempt to make it de jure, now, would be anathema to all those countries that host Kurds, although it is Turkey that has been complaining loudest. From their first day in school, Turks are educated to conceive of their homeland as a highly centralised unitary state. Notions of radical devolution - as demanded by the 12 million Kurds who populate its south-east - run counter to the country's sense of identity and are fended off with all the might that the state can dispense. Although ethnic Kurds account for a fifth of Turkey's total population, they are not recognised in any official capacity. Under Turkey's constitution, Kurds are prohibited from speaking their language publicly, giving their children Kurdish names and practising any customs that might betray their identity. Promised reforms by Ankara's Islamic oriented government - educational rights and two hours of Kurdish broadcasts every week - have failed to be implemented. And, say human rights activists, all the signs show that the war has given rise to renewed repression. Most Turks claim the towns of Kirkuk and Mosul as their own. It was, they say, only because of successive rebellions by the perfidious Kurds in their republic's early years that the oil-rich region ended up being part of modern Iraq, under British administration. It is testimony to the level of emotion evoked by the Kurdish issue that while Turks are overwhelmingly against the war, they wholeheartedly endorse their army sending troops into northern Iraq in order to quash Kurdish nationalism. Any cross-border incursion would undoubtedly exacerbate the long and bitter legacy of hatred between the two peoples. And, in the wake of harsh warnings from Washington and Europe, Ankara has pledged that it will only make the move \"in coordination\" with its \"strategic ally the US\". But Turks fear that in light of the increased military cooperation between US special forces and Kurdish factions, the realm of possibility is now wide open. Even if US officials insist it will be coalition forces that will ultimately control the oil-rich region, few in Turkey believe them. Nervously eyeing Kirkuk and Mosul this week, Turkey's prime minister, Tayyep Recep Erdogan, did not rule out ordering the deployment. \"Entering northern Iraq,\" he said, \"will not be on the agenda as long as Iraq's territorial integrity is preserved and there is no move aimed at seizing the oil of Mosul and Kirkuk.\" For their part, Iraqi Kurds appear determined to retaliate with force, while Turkish Kurds say they are \"certain\" the Turkish army will go in, \"with or without\" US blessing. Whatever the outcome, the restive minority is increasingly marvelling at the prospect that, post-Saddam, their ethnic kith and kin may well enhance their autonomy. \"We are dreaming that our brothers, there, manage to get Mosul and Kirkuk because that will give them the economic power to create a state,\" said Sener, a student in the frontier town of Silopi. \"If that happens Turkish Kurds would want to be part of it because here we have nothing, no progress, no future. No matter how much we try the Turks hate us and we hate them.\" Before the week is out, Washington hopes to have set up an \"early warning system\" to reduce the risk of tensions on the Turkish-Iraqi border. The confidence cell, which will regulate the flow of information, will have offices in both Silopi and northern Iraq. Few are willing to bet, however, that it will successfully rid Turkey of the jitters it has suffered as a result of Operation Iraqi Freedom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
