Once spotted, it was impossible to ignore: charred, broken and punched through with a bullet hole. Around it, a carpet of bullet casings was scattered across the street which runs through the middle of the village of El Aguaje in Mexico\u2019s western state of Michoac\u00e1n. Bones and bullets bore witness to the intensity of a ferocious cartel ambush which two days earlier had killed 13 state police officers and wounded nine. \u201cIt was crazy to send them here like that,\u201d said a young mother who lives a block away from the ambush and asked not to be named. \u201cThey were sent to the slaughter.\u201d And the fact that \u2013 more than 48 hours after the attack \u2013 human remains and ballistic evidence still lay in the open suggested that any investigation of the crime scene had been cursory and carried out in a state of panic. The 14 October massacre was just one of the most extreme episodes of violence in the recent litany of horrors from Mexico\u2019s drug wars. Four days later, gunmen from another cartel mounted an even bigger show of firepower in the northern city of Culiac\u00e1n, rescuing a son of the jailed drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n after he was captured by troops. But the ambush has shone a spotlight on Mexico\u2019s local police forces, which \u2013 under the hands-off security strategy of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 have been saddled with the fight against organized crime groups in many of the country\u2019s most dangerous regions. Cowed, outgunned and enmeshed in alliances with criminal groups, Mexico\u2019s state and local police are clearly not up to the job. The scale of the challenge facing officers was captured in recordings of police radio traffic during the Michoac\u00e1n ambush, in which officers can be heard begging for reinforcements. \u201cPlease, hurry up, there are wounded,\u201d says one officer over a background of automatic gunfire and cries of agony. At another point in the recordings, which were circulated on social media, a male voice is clearly heard declaring: \u201cI\u2019m dying.\u201d Help reportedly took about an hour to arrive \u2013 by which time the gunmen and their armoured vehicles had left the scene. \u201cThey never stood a chance,\u201d said a friend of one of the murdered officers during a hastily organized memorial service in the state capital Morelia that buzzed with discontent in the ranks. One trooper complained that officers are forced to buy their own bullets. He pointed to the wide gaps down each side of his bullet-proof jacket and said regulation helmets were cheap and flimsy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the means to defend ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the support we need to take on any criminal group.\u201d The 14 October ambush was claimed by the Jalisco New Generation cartel, or CJNG, a fast-growing group currently attempting to dominate the Tierra Caliente region of Michoac\u00e1n. Though the CJNG is aggressive, well-funded and particularly well-equipped, it faces smaller local groups which are deeply embedded in the area and reputedly maintain better relations with local politicians and police chiefs. Another set of audio recordings which circulated after the ambush in El Aguaje suggest that the ambush was explicitly designed to disrupt such local alliances. In one of the recordings, which purportedly captured cartel radio communications, a CJNG commander is heard telling his underlings to post messages threatening officers with links to rival factions. \u201cWe want the people and the government to know why we hit them,\u201d he barks. For the residents of El Aguaje, the ambush merely confirmed what they had suspected. \u201cThis is Jalisco territory now. It was the territory of other groups before,\u201d the young mother explained. \u201cThe police are with another group so they don\u2019t usually come here without an army escort.\u201d She dismissed the official version that the police convoy had been sent to serve a warrant over a case in the family courts and speculated that the police chiefs had made a deal to sacrifice low-level officers. For those who live amid the ever-shifting frontlines of Tierra Caliente\u2019s cartel wars, understanding which faction controls which patch of territory is vital information. And that includes keeping a close eye on which side the police are on at any given moment. \u201cIf you are [state police] operating in one of these areas there is no way you are going to be doing straight-up law enforcement,\u201d said Falko Ernst, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group who studies the conflict in Michoac\u00e1n. \u201cYou are always going to be seeking some kind of accommodation with the criminal world. It\u2019s part of the game.\u201d Corruption among the ranks is also encouraged by dismal salaries from which officers are not only expected to buy their own bullets, but often their own uniforms as well. Several families of officers who died at El Aguaje refused attend the memorial service, in protest at the paltry financial support given to the dependants of officers who die on the job. And now, said Ernst, the crisis in the region is intensifying because of President L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201chugs not bullets\u201d security strategy. In the name of correcting the heavy-handed militarized approach of his predecessors, the president has given orders to avoid direct confrontations with the cartels. Peace will come, he promises, once new social programmes provide crime-free routes out of poverty, and Mexicans start to abide by his frequent exhortations to \u201cmake the nation moral again\u201d. Meanwhile, the president insists that his newly formed militarized national guard will enforce the law, but so far the new force has been busier blocking migrants from reaching the United States than pursuing organized criminals. Sitting in his office in the regional capital of Apatzing\u00e1n, Bishop Cristobal Asencio Garc\u00eda scrolled through WhatsApp messages from relatives of kidnap victims and expressed skepticism at the government\u2019s tactics. \u201cNo, no, no, no, no, it can\u2019t be like this. The authorities have to act against impunity,\u201d he said. The bishop said this also meant acting against corruption. \u201cThe stuff that happens here couldn\u2019t happen without at least the tacit acceptance of the authorities.\u201d But while Mexico waits for justice, a new generation is growing up that has only known life amid a multi-sided conflict where there are no clear good guys. A stone\u2019s throw from the site of the ambush in El Aguaje, a nine-year-old girl took a break from sweeping the front porch to recount what she had witnessed. \u201cIt was very loud,\u201d she said, gesticulating wildly as she described how the family had rushed to take cover in a rear bedroom until the sound of gunfire and explosions finally died away. \u201cI thought it would go on forever.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
