The Payments Council said businesses, consumers and financial organisations together made 18.3bn cash payments during the year, versus 19.8bn non-cash payments. Cash payments made up 48% of the number of transactions, with automated and card payments accounting for the rest. Overall debit cards accounted for 24% of payments, followed by direct debits, at 10%. Cheques, at one point predicted to die out entirely, still accounted for 2% of the market. However, among consumers taken alone cash remains the most popular way to pay, despite the continued roll-out of contactless payments and other innovations which make it easier to dispense with notes and coins. Private individuals were responsible for 99% of the cash payments made during the year and chose coins and notes for 52% of their transactions recorded by the Payments Council. They made 26% of purchases on debit cards. While 1.6 million consumers predominantly used cash, representing 3.1% of all adults, there were 2.3 million consumers who rarely used it. Nearly 40% of those who depended on cash were aged 65 or older, while half of those who used it infrequently were aged under 35. A quarter of all cash payments by consumers were for a value of \u00a31 or less, while 56% were for \u00a35 or less. The organisation, which represents the payments industry, said it had not expected cash to be overtaken by non-cash payments until next year, and it forecast that by 2024 it would be used for just 30% of payments. Figures from the cash machine network Link showed the number of ATMs across the UK increased in 2014 to a new peak of 69,382, of which 50,506 were free to use. Cash machines were used 2.8bn times during the year to withdraw a total of \u00a3189bn. David Hensley, director of payments industry body Cash Services, said: \u201cCash remains a vital part of our day-to-day lives and is still the most attractive or only option in lots of situations. We continue to value notes and coins so highly for their familiarity and widespread acceptance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
