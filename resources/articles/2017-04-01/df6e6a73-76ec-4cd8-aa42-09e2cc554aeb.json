United go into the game at the Etihad Stadium on the back of three successive Premier League victories that have revived their hopes of finishing in the top four. Having starred in the 2-0 win against the leaders, Chelsea, last week, the Spain midfielder Herrera played a pivotal role in the 2-0 victory against Burnley at Turf Moor and he admitted the meeting with Pep Guardiola\u2019s side could be make or break for both teams. \u201cIt is going to be the game of the season. We are one point behind them. If we win, we have the chance to finish in the top four. If they win it is going to be very difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth teams are in a good moment so, if one of us wins the game, we are not going to lose a lot of games, or make mistakes after that. Us or them. It is going to be key. \u201cWe are in a very good moment, a very good run and we respect them but we are doing a lot of good things and we have to show it on Thursday.\u201d United go into the derby without the striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and defender Marcos Rojo after both sustained knee injuries in the Europa League quarter\u2011final win against Anderlecht last week. That competition could still provide an entry route into the Champions League for Mourinho\u2019s side, although they will have to get past Celta Vigo in the semi-finals without their top scorer. The Sweden striker has yet to discover for how long he will be out of action but vowed that the suspected anterior ligament damage he sustained would not end his career. \u201cI will go through this like everything else and come back even stronger,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201c So far I played with one leg so it shouldn\u2019t be any problem. One thing is for sure, I decide when it\u2019s time to stop and nothing else. Giving up is not an option. See you soon.\u201d Herrera, who joined United in 2014, was part of the Athletic Bilbao side that lost to Sevilla in the 2012 final and he is hopeful of laying that ghost to rest this time around. He said: \u201cThe Europa League is a competition that makes me very excited because I lost the final three or four years ago and I want to take that knife from my back. So hopefully we can fight for that title as well but I know Celta Vigo very well. They are a very difficult team.\u201d Meanwhile the City midfielder Yaya Tour\u00e9 has hit out at the officials in their 2-1 defeat against Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday. The referee, Craig Pawson, disallowed a goal from Sergio Ag\u00fcero after ruling that the ball had gone out of play in the build-up, only for replays to show that the whole ball had not crossed the line. \u201cI think the referees have to stop this. I am very disappointed,\u201d Tour\u00e9 said. \u201cIt is not the first time; there have been a couple of times. If we have to talk about referees, people are going to say \u2018We complain\u2019 but, when we see the highlights, for me it is very disappointing. Maybe on Thursday we are going to have a better referee or maybe play without a referee \u2013 I\u2019d prefer that.\u201d City have won only two of their past six Premier League matches since beating Sunderland at the start of March and now look under serious threat of failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2011. Tour\u00e9 admitted it is vital they bounce back from the disappointment of losing to Arsenal at Wembley, starting with United. \u201cWe have to recover and be ready. If we win, we will forget this game but, if we lose, then it will be more difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be in the Champions League. City have qualified for the Champions League for six years now and Thursday is very important. It\u2019s a special game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
