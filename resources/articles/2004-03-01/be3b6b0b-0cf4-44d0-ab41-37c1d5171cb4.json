Leeds United plc is the ultimate parent company for a number of subsidiary companies (together 'the Group') including Leeds United AFC Limited, which operates the football club. For the avoidance of doubt, Leeds United AFC Limited has not entered adminstration proceedings. Following an extensive period of marketing the Group for sale and negotiating with key creditors and potential acquirers, it became clear that there were no parties considering an investment into the Group which would have resulted in the survival of Leeds United plc. Negotiations have now been concluded and Leeds United AFC Limited together with other Group assets were sold by the Joint Adminstrators immediately upon appointment to Adulant Force Limited - a company set up by a Yorkshire based consortium to execute the transaction - for an undisclosed sum. The sale has been agreed with the support of the Group's major creditors. Consistent with the Board's various announcements since December 2003, there will be no return to shareholders of Leeds United plc. Leeds United AFC Limited (i.e the Football Club), the Elland Road stadium and the Thorp Arch training grounds are now owned and operated by Adulant Force Limited."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
