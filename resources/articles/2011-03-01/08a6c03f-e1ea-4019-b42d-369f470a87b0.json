It was the previous government that expanded the use of \"no-win no-fee\" agreements to cut legal aid 10 years ago. If they are now costing the government more than legal aid did, it may be right to review the policy, but not to cut people's right to seek justice. No win no fee arrangements provide access to justice where government refuses to do so. The government also expresses concern about the lack of proportionality about costs and fees. It is a well-understood fact that there is a irreducable minimum for case costs, irrespective of the economic value of a case. The Law Society rejects the claim that, if the amount of damages at stake is small compared to the costs of pursuing the claim, then the claim is somehow less legitimate. While the amount of damages recovered may be small, the significance of it to the claimant depends on their own financial situation. For the poorest in society even winning a small claim may be very significant to their personal circumstances. One reason high payments are sometimes paid is that defendants, particularly government bodies, sometimes defend the indefensible or delay settlement unnecessarily. In part the government is legislating to avoid being required to meet the costs of its own abuse of people's rights. It will be able to deny claims with impunity, knowing it has ensured that people will not be able to afford to challenge that denial. Linda Lee President, Law Society \u2022 We urge MPs to reject clause 152 of the police reform bill tomorrow. Official British statements abroad about our democratic values and commitment to international law are meaningless when our MPs are voting for a clause that would make it considerably more difficult to secure the arrest, in England and Wales, of those suspected of war crimes. We expect our MPs as elected representatives to reject any political interference with the courts and to respect their impartiality. Our leaders are out of step on this issue: a new ICM poll shows that only 7% of voters would back plans to make it easier for those suspected of war crimes to visit the UK. When citizens are risking their lives protesting for human rights, democratic freedoms, and an independent judiciary in their countries \u2013 and especially now Britain's role in supporting dictatorships is under the spotlight \u2013 this is no time to make it harder to arrest suspected war criminals here in the UK.
