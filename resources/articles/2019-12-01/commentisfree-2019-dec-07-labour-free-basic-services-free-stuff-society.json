And it has become a typical response to the party\u2019s raft of policies on issues ranging from adult social care to tuition fees, train fares to broadband. Voices from the political centre have objected that the manifesto is \u201cpacked with freebies\u201d, and there have been japes about what other ridiculous things might be free next. Some have wondered why a government should make free to everyone services that many can afford, or asked why utilities such as broadband should be paid for through tax. This seeps through into society, aided by our post-austerity cynicism about government spending and, by extension, public services. What we\u2019re seeing here is a conflict between two different ways of thinking about how the state should function. The \u201cfree-stuff\u201d scoffers see state spending as a means-tested safety net to catch society\u2019s disadvantaged. But the Labour manifesto is premised on the concept that society in general is elevated when the state provides a minimum for everyone. Policy people have termed this \u201cuniversal basic services\u201d, which sounds a bit wonkish. Let us, for the greater good, call this approach \u201cuniversalism\u201d. Hostility to a universalist provision of life\u2019s basics hasn\u2019t always been with us. While Labour\u2019s postwar Clement Attlee government built much of the welfare state, the ideas guiding it surfaced decades earlier. Sidney Webb, co-author of the party\u2019s socialist clause IV (dropped by New Labour), explained in a 1918 pamphlet that Labour should pursue \u201cthe universal enforcement of a national minimum\u201d of services \u2013 the \u201crequisites of healthy life and worthy citizenship\u201d. Political consensus over pooling resources for the common good, regardless of ability to pay, anchored cross-party support for the welfare state, the NHS, schools and public housing \u2013 until Margaret Thatcher\u2019s neoliberal wrecking ball crashed into society in the 1980s. Her government\u2019s belief that the market should allocate resources, while the state should exist only to protect those markets, gained traction in the 1990s and ended up underwriting a lot of New Labour\u2019s approach. The shift was from universality to conditionality \u2013 in the slogan of the time, \u201cno rights without responsibilities\u201d. Taking responsibility for basics previously understood to be provided by the state was reconceived as unburdening the treasury \u2013 and, therefore, a social good. Which is why centrists, through the prevailing wisdom of recent decades, view unconditional access to basic services as regressive \u2013 effectively a subsidy for the rich. This is what\u2019s driving many negative assessments of \u201cfree stuff\u201d. \u201cWe are standing 30 or 40 years of received wisdom on its head,\u201d says Andrew Percy, at UCL\u2019s Institute for Global Prosperity, which inspired Labour\u2019s revived embrace of universal services. As Percy points out, countries across Europe already have expanded universalism: free childcare from six weeks is offered to all families in the Netherlands; elderly people in Belgium and Sweden have access to free social care. But in the UK the arguments grounding this approach have to be made afresh. And they go like this: universal provision is more efficient, better quality, less stigmatising and builds social participation, while tackling poverty and hardship. Also, wealthier people won\u2019t be getting \u201cfree stuff\u201d \u2013 they will simply be paying for it through taxes instead. Crucially, it can also enable the changes required to tackle the climate emergency: universal bus passes, for instance, could reduce pollution as well as congestion, while spreading the social glue of everyday contact. Advocates of universalism are finding they need to reintroduce its principles into the public conversation. \u201cThe language and the confidence in it has gone,\u201d says Anna Coote of the New Economics Foundation. \u201cIf I talk about the collective ideal, it sounds old-fashioned and strange.\u201d The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, often talks about collectivism and helping each other \u2013 which may sound arcane to some precisely because it hasn\u2019t had much parliamentary currency since the 1970s (conversely, the language is refreshingly appealing to younger people because they are so unused to hearing it in politics). But today\u2019s universalism is not a hark-back to clunky, unwieldy, centralised state provision. Instead, the idea is that the state covers costs and ensures standards, but allows design and delivery to be done at local level. European examples from Barcelona to Ghent, Belgium show how authorities can enable cooperatives and other community-led organisations in the provision of social initiatives and amenities. McDonnell\u2019s embrace of a \u201cdecentralised\u201d approach to state provision shows that Labour has caught up with this thinking. A decade of austerity has savaged our public services: UN envoy Philip Alston reported last year that Britain\u2019s shocking levels of poverty were the result of policies that \u201cdeliberately gutted\u201d public services. Meanwhile, polling suggests that people are willing to pay more tax to increase spending on health and education. There is public appetite and need for state-provided services. We just need to remember the universalism on which such policies are built. \u2022 Rachel Shabi is a writer and broadcaster.
