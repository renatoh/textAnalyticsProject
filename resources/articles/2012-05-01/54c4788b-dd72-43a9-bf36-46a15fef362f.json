Then came the download chart as buying habits turned from physical to digital. Now the latest indicator of the nation's musical tastes is the top 100 songs streamed by services such as Spotify and We7. The Official Streaming Chart will launch next Monday, billed as the first chart to rank audio streams from both ad-funded and subscription services in the UK. Ed Sheeran is the most-streamed artist of 2012 to date, followed by Lana Del Ray in second place and David Guetta in third. Rihanna is the fourth most-streamed artist, with Coldplay in fifth. Surprisingly, perhaps, Adele does not make the top 10. The most-streamed track of the year so far is Gotye featuring Kimbra's Somebody That I Used to Know, followed by Titanium by David Guetta featuring Sia and Jessie J's Domino. The Official Streaming Chart is compiled with information from services including Spotify, We7, Napster, Deezer, Zune and ChartsNow. It will be published every week in music industry trade title, Music Week, and online at www.officialcharts.com. The Official Single Chart will mark its 60th anniversary in November. Martin Talbot, managing director of the Official Charts Company which unveiled details of the new service on Thursday, said it was a \"true coming of age moment for music streaming in the UK\". Music streaming has grown significantly in the past 12 months with 2.6bn audio streams in the UK in 2011. Revenues from streaming services increased by 30% to \u00a335m in 2011 but remains a fraction, at just 4.5%, of total music industry revenues. The Spotify head of content, Steve Savoca, described the Official Streaming Chart as a \"defining moment in the evolution of digital music as it shows music consumption as a whole\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
