Gabriel Paulista has been talking for half an hour or so about his return to the Emirates, Arsenal and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, about Valencia and Villarreal, London, language barriers and footballing cultures, referees and repartee too, when he turns to the tattoo that covers his right calf. The boy in the picture is his son and the symbolism is his too. \u201cI saw a photo and I identified with it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult journey to be here. \u201cI grew up in S\u00e3o Paulo. My family had a lot of problems, I saw bad things, and so there are lots of victories along the way. I saw a photo and I wanted to have it as a tattoo and I wanted to put my son in there \u2013 and a ball of course.\u201d When the Valencia defender tells five-year-old Miguel how things were, and he does often, it is a different world. He lived in a wooden house in the favela that flooded when it rained and the family went hungry. His older brother played football but never got the chance and took a wrong turn, got into a lot of trouble. He was killed by police, aged 21. \u201cHe is a lesson for me, a source of motivation. I fight on the pitch for them [his family] and to try to be an example for my own family now,\u201d Gabriel says. The way Gabriel puts it, his mother spent money needed for food on trying to help him play but also told him once that he needed to get a job to help out rather than concentrate on football. He had failed trials before, at Gr\u00eamio and Santos, and his brothers had not made it either. \u201cMy older brothers wanted to be footballers too. I saw them cry because they didn\u2019t get the chance. But I\u2019m a believer and at 17, God wanted to help me,\u201d he says. A friend of his late brother bought a small local team competing in one of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s most important youth tournaments, called Gabriel\u2019s mother and told her he was going to give Gabriel the chance her other son never had. Gabriel says he could not and would not let them down. And so it began. From there, to Vit\u00f3ria, then Villarreal, and then Arsenal. On Thursday, he returns to the Emirates with Valencia to face the club for whom he played 64 games across three years. It was the draw he wanted and one he was swiftly warned about. \u201cI got a message from Nacho Monreal saying: \u2018Watch out! We\u2019ll make it hard for you.\u2019 \u201cI remember my agent calling me and asking if I wanted to play for Arsenal. What was I going to say? Everyone would love to play there, at one of the biggest clubs in the world. The first time I spoke to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, I was nervous,\u201d Gabriel says, waggling his fingers, as if trembling. \u201cHe has such a long history in football, he\u2019d been at the club 20 years and I was nervous but he calmed me down and he gave me a lot of confidence. He\u2019s a coach who embraces you and I have a lot of affection for him. \u201cMy characteristics are strength, aggression so in football terms my adaptation to the league wasn\u2019t so difficult although Arsenal\u2019s football is a bit different: it\u2019s more about the ball. I remember my first game. I was up against [Romelu] Lukaku and there were a couple of 50-50 challenges early on and I went into this challenge hard, down on the ground and came away with the ball and suddenly the noise in the Emirates \u2026\u201d There\u2019s a huge grin on Gabriel\u2019s face, eyes wide almost in awe. \u201cIt was as if I had scored,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a big surprise to me. I knew then what I had to do to. I saw that the English fans love that. I did my best for them and I think the majority of games I played well. I wanted more opportunities and I deserved more but that\u2019s football and now I\u2019m here.\u201d There are no regrets. Well, there is one. \u201cI didn\u2019t make the most of the city: I was someone who stayed at home a lot. We lived in Hampstead and because of the climate I didn\u2019t fancy going out much. We would go walking in a park nearby, where there were some animals, but not a lot else. When I came back to Spain, I regretted it: London is a great city and I never saw much of it.\u201d Nor did he really learn English. Asked what language they spoke on the pitch, Gabriel laughs. \u201cAll of them. I started playing alongside [Laurent] Koscielny or [Per] Mertesacker and they didn\u2019t speak Spanish or Portuguese but they made an effort. Mertesacker was an incredible guy. Koscielny was a bit more reserved, but they both tried. Koscielny would be there shouting \u2018derecha, derecha!\u2019 [right, right] at me. Mertesacker would look things up in Spanish to help me. Even the manager spoke some Spanish to me. And there were others like Monreal, H\u00e9ctor [Beller\u00edn], [Santi] Cazorla, Alexis [S\u00e1nchez]. [Mikel] Arteta too. Mesut [\u00d6zil] also spoke a little bit of Spanish. \u201cAnd when refs came over, I could just about manage \u2018sorry, sorry\u2019,\u201d Gabriel continues, laughing again. \u201cUsually the captains were there to talk for me. Cazorla would translate. Because of my way of playing I like the English referees. If you go into hard to challenge, they don\u2019t pull out the yellow straight away. They come over and talk to you. Here it\u2019s different: the first hard challenge you go into it\u2019s a card and they don\u2019t talk to you. \u201cIt was sometimes a problem not being about to talk my way out of things, though: the problem I had with Chelsea when I was sent off \u2026\u201d Gabriel says, as he recalls the tussle he and Diego Costa had in September 2015. \u201cThe referee spoke to me and Diego and I didn\u2019t understand anything. \u201cThe thing is, Costa is \u2026\u201d There is a pause. \u201cI\u2019m the same. I change on the pitch, I\u2019m like another person, and I want to defend my team. Diego Costa off the pitch is someone with an incredible heart. If I didn\u2019t know him off the pitch then, yeah, I might also say: \u2018This guy is crazy \u2013 he\u2019s a bad guy, bad character.\u2019 But he\u2019s an incredible guy with a big heart. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk to him after the game, I was still too wound up but I saw him later that season at the Emirates. I was talking to David Luiz and he came over and started talking to my son and playing with my son and talking to my wife. These are things that happen in football. He\u2019s not a bad guy: a lot of players change when they cross the line. I change a lot.\u201d It was precisely that aggression that Arsenal supposedly lacked \u2013 \u201cyou can see that they have improved in many things now, in terms of having the ball and that aggression,\u201d Gabriel says \u2013 and that they sought in him. As he talks about the battles, it is clear that most of the time he enjoys it, that there\u2019s a kind of mutual respect between defender and striker. Asked about the hardest forwards he faced, he says: \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult question: Costa, [Sergio] Ag\u00fcero \u2026 Luis Su\u00e1rez too, he\u2019s very aggressive and he\u2019ll talk too. He\u2019s heavy-going, he talks to you all the time because he wants to put you off. And at the end, he\u2019ll give you a hug. I understand that because I do it a lot. I want to provoke but then we are friends as soon as the whistle.\u201d The style that took Gabriel to Arsenal is part of what the Valencia manager Marcelino admires in him too. Marcelino coached Gabriel at Villarreal and brought him back to Valencia; he \u201cmade\u201d him, Gabriel admits. \u201cWhen I first came to Europe, I found it difficult. Football in Brazil is not as organised and I had to learn: where the line is, when to step out, when to stay, defending in the area,\u201d he says. I have learned so much from Marcelino: I\u2019m another player now thanks to the m\u00edster. And that loyalty works both ways. He knows he can rely on me. They can split my face open one game and the next game I\u2019ll be there available to play.\u201d And now the next game is Arsenal, back at the Emirates \u2013 \u201ca special game, at a special stadium, against a very strong team,\u201d Gabriel says, before heading off in search of another victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
