Sexton, who was almost ruled out of the sport in 2001 due to a nerve problem, has struggled since with asthma attacks apparently brought on by stress and chlorine but yesterday she maintained it is \"under control\". The 22-year-old from Portsmouth, competing in Manchester at the British National Championships, is unconcerned even though she is almost three seconds slower this year than she was in winning the world title in Barcelona. \"The Olympics are something you dream of,\" said Sexton, who will also contest the Olympic 100m backstroke and the 4x100m medley. \"It would be the one that I would want the most. Phenomenal.\" The Manchester championships are the British team's last competitive outing before Athens. Only the relay squads have yet to be finalised and, under the national performance director Bill Sweetenham's tough regime, the swimmers can expect to be tested at short notice. Sweetenham has presided over a remarkable turn-around in a relatively short space of time, as the team returned from Sydney 2000 empty-handed. A year later the team came back from the world championships in Fukuoka with seven medals, including gold for the women's 4x200m team. However, it was last year's event in Barcelona that illustrated the extent of the improvement, when Sexton and James Gibson - 50m breaststroke - won golds and eight medals were secured in total. \"We have made a massive improvement in world swimming over the last couple of years,\" the Australian said. \"The world has made major improvements at the same time, so we have had to improve faster than the rest are improving. \"I am exceptionally proud of them all. They themselves are the ones that have made the improvements. The press have given me the credit and I don't deserve it.\" \u00b7 Michael Phelps, 19, is aiming to overhaul Mark Spitz's 32-year-old record of seven golds after announcing he will contest five individual events in Athens, where he also hopes to be involved in three of the United States' relay teams. East Germany's Kristin Otto came closest to matching Spitz when she won six at the 1988 Seoul Olympics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
