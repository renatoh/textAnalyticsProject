Technically, Angels of the North (BBC Three) has nothing to do with the festive season, but trust me: you will feel as cheery after watching a 20-minute episode as you might after flinging back a mince pie and a glass of Baileys. And as you might with the mince pie and a glass of Baileys, you will undoubtedly follow it with a few more helpings and gorge your way to true happiness. The celestial beings in question comprise seraph 31-year-old SammyJo, who owns and runs Longlox salon in Gateshead, and cherub Bev, SammyJo\u2019s mother and \u201cmamager\u201d, who oversee a fluttery host of teenage and twentysomething angels who are mostly called Lauren unless they are not. The cherubim are all at different stages of learning to cut, colour and extend hair in the service of the goddess of beauty, remaking themselves and their clients in the one true image. The goddess of beauty requires thee to be Insta-ready at all times \u2013 smooth of feature, heavy of brow, tanned of skin and as lustrous of barnet as you can manage without falling over. All of this shall be given unto thee at SammyJo\u2019s supersalon. Longlox is an utterly joyful and maximally productive mix of family atmosphere and gulag. SammyJo and Bev know their stuff and they know exactly what their staff should be capable of and what attitude they should have if they are to make it in their world, and the wider one generally. They treat their employees as you would a large gang of teenage offspring for whom you want only the best. Whether they like it or not. So, Kallie is half an hour late for the morning meeting and is duly carpeted. Bev explains what she has done wrong and how it has an impact on everyone else. It is exactly like being lectured by a mum, but one who is paying you. Which is to say, chillingly effective. But she finishes warmly (\u201cI want you to think in your head \u2013 \u2018I want to be proud of meself every day!\u2019\u201d) and once it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done. Kallie returns to the fold, Bev doesn\u2019t harp on (\u201cGet yourself out there,\u201d she says, almost swatting Kallie on the bottom in loving exasperation as she leaves the office, \u201cso you don\u2019t have to shit yerself n\u2019more\u201d, and the child pulls her socks up. SammyJo institutes a system of lanyards \u2013 silver at first, but you will be promoted to gold if you have the right stuff \u2013 and a Junior of the Week competition as spurs to ambition, especially for the latter trio. \u201cAll three juniors need a rocket up their arse,\u201d says SammyJo, fondly. For some of them \u2013 such as Saffron, who describes herself in one of the youngsters\u2019 many individual pieces to camera as having always been \u201cthe only consistent adult in my house\u201d \u2013 Longlox clearly fulfils multiple needs. And the girls themselves are each others\u2019 role models, too. Saffron has just bought herself a car so she needn\u2019t share her mum\u2019s any more, and with Ashleigh before her as a home-owning role model, now has her sights set on saving for a house. When it comes to work ethic, they have 20-year-old Kendall to look to. She puts in her shifts at the salon then helps her mum with deliveries four or five nights a week, and has a two-year-old daughter they look after between them. \u201cIt\u2019s not the nicest of surprises, getting pregnant at 18,\u201d she says. She told Bev first, so she could advise her on how to tell her mum. Bev advised her to do it face to face, but in the end she texted her instead. Everything\u2019s all right now. The programme is choppy, but not frenetic in its direction or structure. It wisely lets the energy come from the angels, who could power the National Grid if Bev just had a spare minute to work out how to harness them without impeding their reach to the chemicals trolley. The new girl, Shannon, from Northern Ireland, is a particular source of interest, because she has bobbed hair \u2013 this is like having a crewcut in Longlox \u2013 and a different accent. \u201cIs it Shrek?\u201d wonders Ashleigh. It is a lovely series about a lovely bunch of people well-suited but not playing to the camera. There are various subplots \u2013 particularly about Tom, SammyJo\u2019s boyfriend, Bev\u2019s unfiltered opinion of whom we have not yet heard, but I live in glorious hope \u2013 but they don\u2019t distract from the main picture. Which is of a group of girls having a great time, in a great place, looked after by each other and some great women. Let the herald angels sing. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 December 2019 because an earlier version used the plural seraphim when the singular seraph was meant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
