Yet within weeks he could find himself back at the cabinet table and the pivotal enforcer for the new prime minister. The former chief whip is widely credited with delivering the vast numbers of MPs who backed Johnson in the leadership race and is one of the most influential figures in Johnson\u2019s camp. MPs say he has used forceful persuasion tactics including telling some their careers would be over unless they backed Johnson \u2013 something he denies. Acting as chief whip for a winning candidate is a strategy Williamson has employed before. As David\u2019s Cameron\u2019s parliamentary private secretary (PPS), he had looked like he was set to go out with his former boss, but he quickly picked a winner in Theresa May and told her he could deliver her the parliamentary numbers. Joey Jones, a former senior civil servant under May at the Home Office, observed how Williamson found the correct niche to insert himself into her campaign. \u201cInitially some of the team were a bit ambivalent because they did not want to be seen as the \u2018Downing Street endorsed\u2019 candidate,\u201d Jones said.\u201cBut once he was brought into the campaign, his assets were so considerable it was a no-brainer. \u201cHe just knows everybody, what makes them all tick, all the gossip. And May\u2019s team didn\u2019t have anyone else like that, Theresa May herself didn\u2019t have a network. He was a godsend.\u201d It was not a foregone conclusion that he would back Johnson. Days before he was sacked as defence secretary, Williamson told friends he was undecided about who he would back but was determined to be on the side of the winner and he would deliver victory for whomever he picked. One minister, a senior backer of a rival Brexiter candidate, said other candidates might have been queasier about employing his services. \u201cFor us it was a genuinely a question of trust. Perhaps we were not prepared to woo him and his talents in the same way,\u201d the minister said. MPs who spoke to the Guardian about Williamson\u2019s operation to support Johnson said it was not all threats: often he could charm them and offer tidbits of valuable gossip. If he had heard that an MP was backing a rival candidate, he would pursue them and suggest that perhaps it was not worth risking their careers to back a loser. MPs said they were repeatedly warned about the perils of double-dealing. When MPs went into the first round of voting, they were asked to leave their phones to one side because rumours had reached the returning officers that Williamson had been demanding MPs photograph their ballot papers. Johnson\u2019s team denied anyone had been asked to do so. Johnson\u2019s wooing of MPs dates back far longer than Williamson\u2019s involvement. \u201cWe were always told that Boris\u2019s problem was he\u2019ll never win back his colleagues,\u201d one senior member of Johnson\u2019s team said. \u201cSo now you know why he has focused entirely on doing that.\u201d For many months, MPs have been approached and invited to make an appointment to see the former foreign secretary to discuss anything of their choosing. Often, MPs have not needed Williamson\u2019s persuasion tactics. \u201cFor certain people in the party, being approached by Gavin just wouldn\u2019t be the tactic that worked,\u201d one MP said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually not a difficult job to get people in to see Boris. He is very likely to win, and this way you get almost two hours with the next prime minister telling him what you think and grilling him on what he thinks. That is worth doing even if you are not going to vote for him.\u201d If Johnson enters No 10, it will be a tricky to find the right job for Williamson. He has a deep personal grudge against the current cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, who is believed to have made it clear Williamson had to be sacked for the NSC breach. Multiple MPs told the Guardian that Williamson had said he was determined to go back to the Ministry of Defence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
