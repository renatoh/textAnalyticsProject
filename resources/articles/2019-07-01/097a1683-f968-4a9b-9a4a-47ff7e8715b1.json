The duchess was invited to oversee the edition by the title\u2019s editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, who said she turned down the opportunity to appear on the cover because she felt it would be \u201cboastful\u201d. Instead, the front of the magazine will feature 15 women who are \u201ctrailblazing changemakers, united by their fearlessness in breaking barriers\u201d, according to Buckingham Palace. In keeping with the edition\u2019s theme, which is \u201cforces for change\u201d, the duchess has assembled women including the actor Jane Fonda, the climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg, the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, and the model Christy Turlington Burns. Inside the magazine, Meghan, who has worked on the project for seven months, recounts a candid conversation between herself and Michelle Obama, and interviews the renowned ethologist and primatologist Dr Jane Goodall. Meghan said: \u201cThese last seven months have been a rewarding process, curating and collaborating with Edward Enninful, British Vogue\u2019s editor-in-chief, to take the year\u2019s most-read fashion issue and steer its focus to the values, causes and people making impact in the world today. \u201cThrough this lens I hope you\u2019ll feel the strength of the collective in the diverse selection of women chosen for the cover as well as the team of support I called upon within the issue to help bring this to light. \u201cI hope readers feel as inspired as I do by the forces for change they\u2019ll find within these pages.\u201d Enninful said Meghan was the first person to guest edit the September issue. \u201cTo have the country\u2019s most influential beacon of change guest edit British Vogue at this time has been an honour, a pleasure and a wonderful surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you will see from her selections throughout this magazine, she is also willing to wade into more complex and nuanced areas, whether they concern female empowerment, mental health, race or privilege. \u201cFrom the very beginning, we talked about the cover \u2013 whether she would be on it or not. In the end, she felt that it would be in some ways a \u2018boastful\u2019 thing to do for this particular project. She wanted, instead, to focus on the women she admires,\u201d he added. The September edition of fashion magazines is considered to be the most important of the year as they carry the most advertising and often feature iconic cover stars. Vogue\u2019s 2012 issue with Lady Gaga on the cover ran to 916 pages and weighed 2.5kg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
