Set largely in a \u201cno-star hotel\u201d in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, it crackles with sly subversive wit and rage at the inequities of life in contemporary Britain. In a series of surreal episodes, the unnamed narrator, who we are told is an \u201cEU national\u201d, and Shae, described as \u201ca second-generation economic migrant\u201d, endure minimum-wage work at the hotel, while joyously revelling in their otherness. Shae is \u201cworking class and also queer (there\u2019s no hiding it)\u201d. They (as Shae, the narrator and Waidner all prefer to be identified) are \u201clooking for their parent\u201d, while the narrator is preparing to take the Life in the UK test, an ordeal replete with trick questions (\u201cWho wrote \u2018The Daffodil?\u2019\u201d). Along the way, there are run-ins with gay Ukip activists, and local youths with Staffies \u201cvaping outside Wimpy\u201d. The narrator and Shae also struggle with fantastical, shapeshifting creatures, such as a group of \u201cecological refugees (the polar bears) and African elopers I mean antelopes (the reeboks)\u201d, and a \u201clypard\u201d, an allusion to William Blake\u2019s \u201cThe Tyger\u201d, one of four canonical poems in the Life in the UK test. The hotel\u2019s tyrannical manager, House Mother Normal, has migrated from BS Johnson\u2019s radical eponymous novel of 1971. None of which seems anomalous in a book that deliberately uses intertextuality, the lives of marginalised communities and intersectional discourse as a form of cultural resistance. This might make the novel appear overly earnest, yet its Situationist delight in disrupting normative society is infectious. A sense of free association is everywhere, giving the prose a ludic whimsicality that nevertheless conceals a knuckle-duster. As the narrator comments, on reading a scene of bestiality by BS Johnson: \u201cGhastly, really, but funny. Funny\u2019s important \u2026 (Some BS there, B.S.?)\u201d Or on their resemblance to the character Eleven from the Netflix series Stranger Things: \u201cI\u2019m giving off child with supernatural abilities levels of outsider weirdness.\u201d When the hotel is visited by officers from the Isle of Wight Immigration Enforcement Unit, the narrator uses these powers to lasso them. The novel ends with entries from Sandown Zoo\u2019s Visitors\u2019 Book, a \u201cslum\u201d zoo that comes to stand for the UK itself post EU referendum: \u201cThis is a con\u201d; \u201cDesolate\u201d; \u201cHeartbreaking\u201d. In a recent interview, Waidner said they were \u201cagainst the idea that formally innovative literature now should be this rarefied thing, of interest to an elite readership\u201d. We Are Made of Diamond Stuff might be the most engaging state-of-the-nation fiction since Anthony Cartwright\u2019s Brexit novel, The Cut. Daringly experimental, this is the cutting edge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
