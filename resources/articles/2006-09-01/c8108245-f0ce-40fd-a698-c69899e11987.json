The monetary policy committee begins its two-day meeting today and speculation in the City was high that strong service sector data would increase the chances of another rate rise after August's rise. But economists were left confused after the purchasing managers' index (PMI) from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply came out weaker than expected, while input prices soared, prompting inflation fears. The headline PMI, measuring services activity, fell for the fourth consecutive month to 56.7 from 57.9 in July. Expectations over future growth also dropped to 70.6, the lowest since 2003. \"The retreat in the PMI joins a list of disappointments on the UK economy that have emerged in the immediate wake of the Bank of England's August hike,\" said Daragh Maher, economist at Calyon, \"Were the pace of service sector growth to slow further, it would call into question the Bank's confidence on the outlook ... not least because manufacturing is proving slow to emerge from recession.\" The prices-paid index, however, surged to 63.9 from 60.5 in July, the highest in the PMI's decade-long history, as rising energy prices led to a jump in raw material costs. The index on output prices also rose a hefty 2.2 points to 55.4. \"From a monetary policy perspective both the prices charged and the input prices indices are undesirably strong,\" said Philip Shaw at Investec. \"So despite the relative softness of the headline numbers, this report is unlikely to stave off a rate increase over the coming months.\" Meanwhile, August's poor weather led to a weak retail performance, especially in the food sector, a British Retail Consortium survey said yesterday. Like-for-like sales growth in the three months to August fell to 2.7% from 4.1% in the same period to July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
