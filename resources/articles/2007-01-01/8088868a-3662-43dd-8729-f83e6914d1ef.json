That's certainly how it feels, come breaktime, as she looks down at her pupils in the playground below: today, for example, we can see children from Italy and Sweden, India and South Africa, Iraq and Somalia. Not to mention Nigeria and Eritrea, Japan and Denmark, Burma and Afghanistan. And then there are the Thais and the Turks, the Bangladeshis and the Congolese, the Chinese and the Croatians. The list goes on ... and on. This is Southfields community college, Britain's most ethnically diverse school, whose 1,300 pupils speak, between them, an extraordinary 72 languages, and where more than 60 countries are represented. Step inside Southfields, and the clues are everywhere. Giant maps dominate the wallspace; pupils' pictures are accompanied by outline drawings of the countries where they were born. Walk along any corridor, and children from all corners of the earth pass by - many arm in arm. Valin is proud of the way her pupils integrate. The fact that Southfields is a specialist sports college, she says, helps a lot: \"If there's no language in common, sport is a great way to bring people together.\" But children pitching up from all corners of the globe - often mid-term, usually at a moment's notice and sometimes speaking no English at all - is surely any head's nightmare? Not at all, says Valin. \"It's hugely enriching for us - the cultural diversity adds an enormous depth to everything we do here,\" she says. \"Our children are very, very keen to learn. When you've seen the things some of them have seen, and lived through the times some of them have lived through, you don't need to be told that education is the key to a better life. You understand it, in a way our home-grown children sometimes don't.\" Anita Sollis, who heads the school's ethnic minority achievement team, says many pupils have come to the UK with their families to move away from war, famine or a difficult political situation. \"Their parents have made a journey, and they understand that now, through education, there is another journey to be made,\" she says. The school's results bear out their views: the number of pupils getting five A*-Cs at GCSE is up 20 percentage points over the past three years, to 55%. Talk to the pupils and you hear the same stories, time after time: stories of resilience, of bravery and then of hard graft and achievement. Fadumo Yusuf, 15, saw children killed in Mogadishu, where she lived until three years ago; her hand is still scarred where she was caught in crossfire. \"Many times we had to hide under the desks to avoid being shot, but that time I got a bullet in my hand,\" she says. \"Here life is very different. But it wasn't easy at first. When I came here I had no English. Now, I'm studying for my GCSEs.\" Her friend Ifrah Omar, also 15, moved from Somalia to Saudi Arabia as a young child, where she studied in Arabic. She moved to the UK two years ago, and recently got an A* in her Arabic GCSE. Any children who can, take early GCSEs in languages in which they are fluent. \"It gives them enormous self-esteem to get a top grade in a GCSE before they are even in year 11,\" says Valin. \"Some of my pupils have even been in the top 10 candidates nationally for the language GCSEs they've taken.\" Ifrah's goal is to stay on at Southfields for A-levels, and then go to university to train as a midwife. Naila Tahir, 17, who was born in Pakistan, and raised in India and then Belgium before coming to the UK last year, is predicted As in her A-levels in biology, chemistry and maths. She hopes to study medicine. And there are other success stories, such as the initially difficult pupil who arrived a few years ago, with no English, from Kosovo; he's about to embark on a master's degree at Cambridge. So what's the secret? According to Valin, what matters most is having the expertise and resources to deliver the specialist support and teaching that these children need. It's a question, she says, of assessing individual need as quickly as possible when a child arrives in the school. \"What we try to do is work out a child's ability. If they speak no English, we try to find someone who speaks the language they do speak. We try to tease out their story, because we need to be able to provide emotional support if they need it. If they need intensive English lessons, we take them out of class for one period each day, but they stay with their class the rest of the time, because it's a mistake to take them away from the group - they have to integrate. And they do pick up English incredibly quickly.\" Southfields' reputation as a centre of excellence for teaching children from different backgrounds means it has been able to attract funding for specific projects. The school has a group for traumatised pupils, for example, which meets with a psychologist, and there's also a mentoring scheme under which lawyers, bankers, doctors and other professionals from ethnic minorities have talked to pupils. It has had an impact: Whitney Blackstock, 18, whose family has a Jamaican background, says she was particularly struck by the input from a stockbroker who described how he worked his way up. Mazdak Araghrez, also 18, who was born in Russia and lived as a young child in Afghanistan, found a social worker's sessions on self-esteem especially helpful. The school has always had a big racial mix, but it is over the past decade that its pupil diversity has really grown. Now, its reputation is such that it attracts families moving to the UK who are looking for a supportive educational environment. \"We've got a boy whose family are moving to the area from Wembley because they feel this is the right place,\" says Valin. \"Some of our children travel from miles away to get here.\" Year 11 children, in particular, often make a long journey; many schools are loth to take year 11 children arriving from abroad, because of the effect on GCSE results, but Valin welcomes them and has a special programme under which they are assigned to a tutor group, but are taught independently some of the time if they are not able to be in the exam group. Yet while children from ethnic minorities travel across town to go to Southfields, many of the white population on its doorstep send their children to school elsewhere. \"People who live around here aren't used to seeing Southfields as their school,\" says Valin. \"But we do want to reach into the local community more. And we're beginning to see that change. Our results speak for themselves - this school works.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
