About six candidates are understood to have met ITV's board last week in what is considered to be potentially a final round of interviews to find a replacement for Michael Grade. The shortlist is thought to include Guillaume de Posch, the former chief executive and chairman of ProSiebenSat.1, and former BSkyB chief executive Tony Ball. Ball had been an early frontrunner, promoted heavily by a faction of ITV's shareholders, however his appointment as a non-executive director to BT's board last month raised questions over conflicts of interest. The early public lobbying of Ball is not thought to have played well with ITV's nominations committee, which is chaired by former HBOS chief executive James Crosby. Although Fox lacks direct media experience his role in turning around beleaguered music retailer HMV is thought to have played well with the task facing embattled ITV. Internal candidate John Cresswell, ITV's chief operating officer, is now considered to be an outside option and Rupert Howell, ITV's managing director of operations, is not thought to have progressed to the final stage of the recruitment process. Some analysts have held out hope that an appointment might be announced at ITV's half-year results, due to be reported next Thursday, although many observers believe this timeline to be overly optimistic. It is expected that September is more likely for an announcement. According to a source close to the process the hunt for a new chief executive may not yet be in its final stages. Headhunter Russell Reynolds pledged to conduct a full and thorough review of all candidates. It is not known if candidates including John Smith, the chief executive of BBC Worldwide, who is away this week, and Malcolm Wall, the former head of Virgin Media's content division, are still in contention. Michael Grade will remain non-executive chairman after the appointment of a new chief executive. ITV, the UK's largest commercial broadcaster, is struggling to cope with the global ad slump. Revenue at ITV1, which accounts for 39% of all UK TV ad spend, fell 20% year on year in the first six months. The company is looking to offload assets including Friends Reunited. It was reported this week that the social networking website could be sold for as little as \u00a315m. ITV had paid \u00a3175m for it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
