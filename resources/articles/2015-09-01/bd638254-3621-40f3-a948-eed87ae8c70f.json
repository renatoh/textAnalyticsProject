Miss Piggy was always the more charismatic performer, the more powerful presence in that relationship: she was Angelina to Kermit\u2019s Billy Bob, the Cher to his Sonny, the Liz to his Larry (Fortensky). And yet he always got the top billing, the most screen time and the most credit for his intelligence. It\u2019s now clear that he was also always colluding with the producers and directors to make sure that Miss Piggy looked like a violent, egotistical harridan and he was seen as the sensitive, Rainbow-Connection-bleating ex-hippie who gracefully put up with both her personality and living in her shadow. Woe is him, we all said \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what he wanted us to say. Don\u2019t believe me? Just look at what he said after they broke up a month ago. It can be tough to work with your ex \u2026 It can be tough to be the executive producer on your ex\u2019s late-night TV show, especially when your ex is a pig. I don\u2019t know whether any of you have ever dated pigs. Well, apparently Kermit can\u2019t get enough of women like his ex \u2013 as long as they\u2019re younger and thinner than her and less successful than him (but still work at ABC, so he can rub her in Miss Piggy\u2019s face). But even if this is just some public relations stunt to promote the new show, he and his fellow producers have sorely misjudged their audience. While the audience of the 1980s might\u2019ve been filled with the fear of powerful women and willing to sympathise with the \u201cplight\u201d of the lesser men who loved them (or at least profited handsomely off them) \u2013 and even understood and supported men\u2019s urge to date their exes\u2019 younger, dumber Plasticine lookalikes \u2013 the situation has changed in 2015. Nowadays, Miss Piggy is a beloved feminist icon who covers Bitch Better Have My Money and Fuck the Pain Away (with equal aplomb) to applause from fans both new and old, and Kermit\u2019s the behind-the-scenes wet noodle still whining about how hard it is to be green while picking up goodness knows how many of Hollywood\u2019s near-infinite star-chasers. This is the year of sympathising with Jennifer Garner, not some nanny-diddling Ben Affleck type; of applauding Susan Sarandon for dating a much younger man and looking down on Mel Gibson for doing something similar; of #TeamAmberRose (and her VMA outfit) and deleting Wiz Khalifa off your iPhone. Times have changed for the Kermits of the world, but they haven\u2019t changed with it. Miss Piggy has, though \u2013 and she\u2019ll be just fine without him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
