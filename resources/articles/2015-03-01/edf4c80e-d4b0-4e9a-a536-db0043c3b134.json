Ronald J Brockmeyer stepped down as Ferguson\u2019s municipal court judge after Missouri\u2019s supreme court ordered that all the court\u2019s cases be transferred to the St Louis County circuit court, according to a source who was not authorised to speak publicly about the decision. Under the same ruling, Judge Roy L Richter of the Missouri court of appeals will be assigned to the county\u2019s circuit court, where he will hear all of Ferguson\u2019s municipal court cases \u201cto help restore public trust and confidence\u201d in the system. \u201cJudge Richter will bring a fresh, disinterested perspective to this court\u2019s practices and he is able and willing to implement needed reforms,\u201d Missouri\u2019s chief justice, Mary R Russell, said in a statement that described the move as an \u201cextraordinary action\u201d taken under article five of the Missouri constitution. A scathing report by the Department of Justice last week concluded that Ferguson\u2019s police and court system was blighted by racial bias. Investigators accused Brockmeyer and his court officials of aggressively using the municipal court to raise revenue for the city. The policy is blamed by many for damaging relations between the city\u2019s overwhelmingly white authorities and residents, two-thirds of whom are African American. Brockmeyer, 70, was singled out by investigators as a driving force behind Ferguson\u2019s strategy of using its municipal court to generate revenues aggressively. Investigators found that Brockmeyer had boasted of creating a range of new court fines, \u201cmany of which are widely considered abusive and may be unlawful\u201d. Ferguson is accused in a class-action federal lawsuit, brought by public defenders and legal non-profits, of imprisoning impoverished residents in the city jail for being unable to pay fines of a few hundred dollars for minor offences. While jailing residents, Brockmeyer owes more than $172,000 in unpaid taxes to the US government, the Guardian disclosed last week. A staff member at Brockmeyer\u2019s law offices in St Charles County did not return a call seeking comment. A press release accompanying Russell\u2019s order said that all pending and future cases that were to be heard by Ferguson\u2019s municipal court would instead be heard by Richter at the circuit court from 16 March until further notice. A court spokeswoman could not confirm how cases would proceed this week. The decision was welcomed cautiously by Alec Karakatsanis, the co-founder of Equal Justice Under Law, one of the legal non-profits that is suing the city. \u201cThe problems we are dealing with are endemic to our legal system and not isolated to the small municipality of Ferguson,\u201d said Karakatsanis. \u201cI hope this serves as a first small step toward confronting the horrors that we visit everyday on poor people of colour in the legal system and not as any kind of attempted solution. Russell said that staff from the state courts administrator\u2019s office would also be assigned to \u201creview Ferguson municipal court practices and to assist Richter in making necessary changes\u201d. The state\u2019s chief justice signalled in her statement on Monday that regional or even statewide reform may be necessary for a municipal court system that has been sharply criticised as a failed system that has lost the trust of many residents. \u201cAlthough we recognise the local control our statutes give these uniquely local entities, we must not sacrifice individual rights and society\u2019s collective commitment to justice,\u201d said Russell. Brockmeyer was also named among a group of white Ferguson officials found by Justice Department investigators to be writing off citations for themselves and friends while punishing residents for similar offences. Another of these officials, court clerk Mary Ann Twitty, was fired by the city in connection with racist emails. The report said Brockmeyer agreed to \u201ctake care\u201d of a speeding ticket for a senior Ferguson police officer in August 2014, and had a red light camera ticket he received himself from the nearby city of Hazelwood dismissed in October 2013."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
