It would have been a shame to let all that space go to waste, so I practised my penalty shoot-outs against butlers Vashish and Ajay wearing little more than my after-sun moisturiser. Starting with a watermelon instead of a ball, we moved on to grapefruits when it nearly broke my toe. It was a change from earlier visits to Mauritius's hippest hotel, Le Touessrok, when I had played football on the beach with hotel staff. But then moving the football pitch from the sand to the marble floor (which makes it a bit more accident prone) is not the only change at the hotel, which has just reopened after almost a year under wraps, a \u00a331 million renovation and with a new name - the One&amp;Only Le Touessrok. To me, Le Touessrok has always been the jewel in the Indian Ocean, the eighth wonder of the world. Since first going there seven years ago, I've visited it about five times, most recently to spend a week recharging my batteries before Christmas. I always feel and look much better opening my presents with a suntan and, given the fact I had not had a day off since being in the jungle for ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get me Out of Here! I thought it would be a good idea to have a bit of rest and recuperation before turning 31, because if anything could make me stressed that would. From the outside, the hotel looks pretty much the same as it did before, with its thatched roofs, but inside it is a different story. Before, the decor was neither here nor there, although I always thought the hotel was heavenly, which wasn't hard when they put me in some of the best suites (including the one where Andrew and Fergie spent their honeymoon). The interior has metamorphosed from classical Mauritian with lots of wood to something that it is sexy, minimalist and contemporary. It is all very clean looking and the ocean-front suites on Frangipani Island, where I stayed, are the most romantic I have ever known. I always think if you walk into a cool room, you automatically take on personally this feeling of cool. The beds are futon-style and you do not have to move from them to do anything, including controlling the two flat-screen televisions. Mind you, the controls are so complicated I could hardly find out where you were meant to switch the whole thing on. The bathrooms alone are almost the size of an entire pied-\u00e0-terre in Chelsea, with shower heads the size of frisbees for heaven's sake! And the bath is like a big egg - very comfortable but quite hard to get out of. The open-plan layout, where you just have to open some louvred doors off the bedroom, is a change from the old, separate bathrooms and makes you feel very Hollywoody. This feeling is enhanced by the sheer number of celebs walking around - after all, this fashionable hotel is really a place to see and be seen. And talk about being in good company; I saw all sorts of familiar faces relishing the winter sun. On the beach, Joseph Fiennes was looking gorgeous with his head buried in a book, and Rufus Sewell was there with his adorable baby. So was Mark Shuttleworth, the South African businessman who paid $12 million for a flight into space - it makes first class to Mauritius look like a package deal. Though, of course, the eight seconds he took to get into orbit was a bit quicker than the flight to the Indian Ocean. Jodie Kidd, who was there with her boyfriend Tarquin and her sister Jemma, was hanging out by the waterski area - I hardly saw her without a waterski on her foot. And Liberty Ross, the model, was there - if you've never felt fat and ugly on the beach, rest assured that it's easy with these gorgeous models about. On top of which, Amanda Donohoe was turning heads on the beach before moving on to the bar at night to sing the best impromptu version of 'Summertime' I've ever heard. Before the renovation, the St G\u00e9ran, also on Mauritius, was much more celebrity-oriented than its sister hotel, Le Touessrok. I always thought the St G\u00e9ran was for grown-ups and Le Touessrok was more for kids, but now they are definitely on the same level, though Le Touessrok is probably a lot more fun and more for the happening people. The service in the revamped Touessrok is truly amazing, with lots of beach boys in white uniforms who come down to the beach with those silver trays to clean your sunglasses. I had them do my watch as well while they were at it. The old Touessrok did not have butlers unless you were staying in one of the top suites, but now there is a butler button on the phone in every room. From the moment you arrive at Mauritius's airport you don't really see your suitcase, which is whisked off and then the butlers take care of it, unpack it, press your clothes and stuff your boots with tissue paper. Vashish, who I call Vashish Hashish, had been my butler when I stayed in the suite at the old Touessrok. He introduced himself saying, 'I'll be a good butler - I served Naomi Campbell last week.' I thought if he was good enough for Naomi Campbell, he was good enough for me. The butlers ask you what drink you would like to wake up with and what you would like at 6pm, and they come every day and give it to you. They remember how you like your coffee and all that. And then there is the great bath menu, where you can choose from a list which type of bath you want your butler to prepare for you. I had one with essential oils, with petals scattered on the top, which came with chocolates to eat. Unfortunately, I think I may have jumped the gun as this was supposed to be the bath for honeymooners! What is unique to this hotel and makes it so incredibly special is that nothing is too much trouble. Both on this visit and on my previous ones, I was able to fulfil every possible fantasy with the minimum of effort. On an earlier trip, I asked for a private firework display with music, and they set it up. At other times, you ask where dinner is and they look at you with a secretive smile and then set up a table on the beach somewhere. This time, the staff set up a raft at sea for me to have a candle-lit dinner, bringing me food by wading through the water. Sometimes, it seems as though everyone is asking if you are okay and, though it is nice, I occasionally like to get away from it all. That was no problem either - they got me a really cool speedboat with a picnic of champers, caviar and lobster and dropped me on a private island, saying they would be back later. Le Touessrok is also a mere five-minute boat ride from another island, the Ille aux Cerfs, which means Isle of Stags. My favourite restaurant is there and they serve the simplest barbecued lobster or chicken, baked potatoes and corn on the cob as you sit on the beach. There is also a market selling a variety of crafted Mauritian souvenirs, shoes and beads and, believe it or not, a Ralph Lauren outlet right there on the beach. Trust me to find the designer shop, even if it is hidden in the palm trees. The place is also ideal for kids - learning to waterski at Ile aux Cerfs is like skiing on the calm of a millpond because the water is so flat. If that doesn't happen to take your fancy you can always visit the waterfalls, which are breathtaking. Daredevils such as myself can dive off them, or you just sit in the natural cave holes and let the water mas sage away any tension you may have left after the hotel's execellent service. Not that you are likely to have much tension if you have visited the Givenchy spa, a great addition to Le Touessrok. This is a girl's ultimate haven, full of wonderful uniformed ladies just there to help with every physical problem I could possibly think of. I would love to be able to describe the Ylang Ylang massage I had after I stepped exhausted off the plane (four expert hands on one tired body) but couldn't even begin to - all I know is it must have been excellent as I fell asleep within seconds. There's a wide range of beauty treatments, ranging from pedicures, to make sure your toes are beach-happy and ready for inspection after a winter hidden in shoes, to water-based treatments in aqua baths. Outside the spa, there's plenty of water activity too, from waterskiing and diving in the turquoise lagoons, to plunging in and out of the hotel's pools. By day I'd often relax at the poolside, sipping multicoloured cocktails and tucking into sushi canap\u00e9s. The sushi is excellent in the new Japanese restaurant; though the food always was good in the old Le Touessrok, there is much more variety now. By night I'd be so exhausted from sheer relaxation and that crucial decision over which factor sun cream to apply that all I'd want to do was slip between the softness of Egyptian cotton sheets, or watch a movie on one of the flat-screen TVs. You're never short of choice as the rooms now have individual DVDs and there's a library of films as well as a CD library with everything from Mozart to Eminem. So if you ask me if Le Touessrok does still rock, the answer is a definite yes. But with all the marvels of the hotel's revamped infrastructure, I was really pleased that the beaches and the trees and the sounds of the sea were still as magical as ever - it has changed, but the spirit of Le Touessrok remains the same.
