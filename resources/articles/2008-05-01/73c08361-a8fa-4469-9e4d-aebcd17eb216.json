Sweden's 37-year-old world No2, whose \u00a311m earnings from the American women's tour are \u00a34m more than anyone else, has won three times already this year. But she said she is to \"step away\" from competitive play and will concentrate on her business interests. She is also getting married again next April. \"I'm leaving on my own terms,\" Sorenstam said ahead of this week's Sybase Classic in New Jersey. Sorenstam is the only woman ever to shoot 59 in tournament play and still hopes to add to her 10 major titles, but nothing she does will ever match the 2003 Colonial tournament in Texas when she became the first female in 58 years to compete on the US Tour. She missed the cut, but was far from outclassed and on her return to her own circuit remained the dominant figure until the emergence of Mexican Lorena Ochoa in the last two seasons. Between 2001 and 2005 Sorenstam won more majors than Tiger Woods - seven to five - and they texted when they won to remind each other of the score between them. Her 72 LPGA Tour victories put her third on the career list behind Kathy Whitworth (88) and Mickey Wright (82), while only three women have won more majors.
