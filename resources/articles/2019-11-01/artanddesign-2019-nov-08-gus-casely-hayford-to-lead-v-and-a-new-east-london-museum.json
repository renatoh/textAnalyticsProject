Casely-Hayford has been the director of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African Art in Washington DC since 2018, but has returned to London, where he was born, for what is likely to be one of the biggest museum projects of the next decade. He said he felt \u201cenormously privileged\u201d to be asked to join the V&amp;A. \u201cIt has long been the arts institution that I have looked to for innovation and inspiration,\u201d Casely-Hayford said. \u201cAnd what a brief \u2013 working to deliver a new museum for east London. And what a collection \u2013 the most thrilling single body of material culture I have ever encountered.\u201d Casely-Hayford said the V&amp;A was an organisation with the appetite and ambition to shift the way museums work and engage. \u201cWe are going to craft dynamic and compelling ways for our audiences to get close to the extraordinary, to be transported across time and geography by the most beautiful and intriguing things,\u201d he said. Tim Reeve, the V&amp;A\u2019s deputy director, said the net had been cast wide to find the right leader. \u201cThis is a hugely ambitious project \u2013 for east London, for the UK and for international cultural exchange,\u201d he said. \u201cIt offers us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform how we engage with young, diverse audiences and to revolutionise how our collections are accessed and experienced.\u201d The planned waterfront V&amp;A East, on the former London Olympic site in Stratford, will be part of a new cultural quarter that includes a Sadler\u2019s Wells dance theatre, BBC recording and performance studios and UAL\u2019s London College of Fashion. Collectively, it will be known as East Bank. Ten minutes\u2019 walk away, at Here East, there will be a new storage and research centre for the V&amp;A that will be open to the public. Casely-Hayford will be responsible for creative strategy and programming across both venues. Casely-Hayford is a former executive director of arts strategy at Arts Council England and has advised and sat on the boards of numerous arts institutions. On TV, his credits include BBC Two\u2019s The Culture Show, two series of Lost Kingdoms of Africa on BBC Four and two series of Tate Britain\u2019s Great British Walks for Sky Arts. He comes from a strikingly talented family. His siblings include the late fashion designer Joe Casely-Hayford, the chair of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, Margaret Casely-Hayford, and the TV producer Peter Casely-Hayford. Casely-Hayford will take up his role in the spring of 2020. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 November 2019 to clarify that the new V&amp;A storage and research centre will be one of the tenants at the Here East hub."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
