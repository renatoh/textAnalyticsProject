A 10-stone person burns about 650 calories an hour. 5 stars Stress-busting An aggressive sport that's perfect for working out any pent-up frustrations. It also requires great focus, helping to empty your mind of troubling thoughts and day-to-day stresses. 5 stars Avoiding injury Injuries are rare, but they may include sprains and strains from performing a move, or bruising from accidental contact. 4 stars Brain-boosting Helps build sharp reflexes for evading and attacking when sparring with a partner. Using a variety of kicks and punches in an effective sequence at speed also challenges your brain. 5 stars Flexibility The kicks are generally aimed at higher than hip height, developing excellent flexibility in the hip and pelvis area. Some kicks require you to be almost in standing splits. 4 stars Capoeira Strength and cardiovascular fitness Originated as a form of self-defence disguised as a dance by slaves, this develops incredible agility and strength. A 10-stone person burns about 480 calories an hour. 4 stars Stress-busting Competitive but not aggressive - it's played within a ring of people, called a roda, and is accompanied by music and singing, so has a social aspect. It also requires intense focus. 5 stars Avoiding injury This depends on the style and whether it's full-contact, but there is a risk of sprains and strains, or contact injuries such as bruises (headguards and padded gloves can help prevent these). 3 stars Brain-boosting You'll develop a good sense of rhythm set to the African/Brazilian beats of capoeira, plus you learn to sing in Portuguese. Avoiding an opponent's attack requires a great sense of timing. 5 stars Flexibility Even better for developing flexibility because of its acrobatic moves. As with kick boxing, they sound daunting, but can be learned over time. 5 stars"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
