Party officials sent two strongly worded emails \u2013 one a public statement and the other a rallying call to party members \u2013 and held their breath. At the forefront of their minds was the 2019 federal election, where the same sort of disinformation had been effectively weaponised against Labor. The party\u2019s own 2019 election postmortem acknowledged Labor had not been able to properly prevent the spread of claims about a death tax circulating online. Belated denials in the mainstream media had only \u201cmade matters worse\u201d. There would be no repeat of that sort of timid response. \u201cThere is no death tax in Queensland,\u201d the Labor state secretary, Julie-Ann Campbell, said in the public statement on 16 October. \u201cThere are no plans for one from Labor. Anyone who says there are is lying. That makes Clive Palmer a liar.\u201d The subsequent message to Labor members encouraged them to do whatever they could to publicly refute Palmer\u2019s baseless claims. The mining magnate\u2019s social media posts became a pile-on of angry Labor supporters and others. \u201cCalling Clive out licensed [party members] to do things like call radio stations and get on Facebook and Twitter and call it out too,\u201d a Labor campaign source said. Labor believes the blunt response \u2013 including repeatedly calling the famously litigious Palmer a liar \u2013 nullified his $4m anti-Labor election campaign, which included full-page newspaper advertisements and billboards pushing the death tax misinformation. Still, in a pandemic campaign where Labor built its pitch to voters by otherwise playing calm, risk-free politics, taking Palmer on directly felt like pulling the pin from a grenade and lobbing it into the unknown. No one wanted to provoke the sort of \u201crebound effect\u201d that occurred in 2019, where denials amplified a scare campaign. No one wanted to look panicked. \u201cOh, I was shitting myself,\u201d the Labor figure said. Labor takes the fight to Palmer Electoral Commission Queensland donations data shows the United Australia party and its candidates were given $4.8m for the election by Palmer, his wife and his companies. However, the magnate\u2019s spend on the campaign was likely much much more, given his flagship resources company, Mineralogy, authorised many of the newspaper ads, billboards and also sent blanket text messages to voters. In the final weeks, Palmer regularly took out pages two and three of the Courier-Mail, including full-pages pushing the bogus claims about a death tax. Daniel Angus, an associate professor at the Queensland University of Technology\u2019s Digital Media Research Centre, told Guardian Australia that disinformation often takes hold via a marketing tactic called \u201ctrading up the chain\u201d \u2013 where a message is seeded in a less-credible forum and then repackaged by people who use it to appeal to a wider audience. \u201cI think [Clive] was hoping that it would be picked up, then you would have the press framing that up and using it to set the agenda,\u201d Angus said. \u201cAs soon as light was thrown on it and it was vehemently shut down and attacked early, it lacked the oxygen to be taken up.\u201d Angus said any political campaign dealing with conspiracy theories had to make a difficult decision. \u201cDo you feed them, or do you try to bury them? It\u2019s called the oxygen of amplification \u2013 the idea is that you want to starve these things of oxygen and they\u2019ll flame out on their own. \u201cIn this case Labor seemed to do the right thing by calling it out. The key element to this is that the death tax as an idea was promoted so heavily it was already in full public view, so there was little risk that by Labor talking about it they would be giving it oxygen in the same sense as a fringe idea,\u201d he said. Labor\u2019s decision to directly confront Palmer and label him a \u201cliar\u201d \u2013 including by encouraging party members to lampoon him on social media \u2013 would have further damaged his standing with voters, Angus added. The United Australia party \u2013 whose constitution gives Palmer personal control \u2013 polled 0.61% of the vote statewide. LNP members believe links to Palmer damaged party Photographs of Liberal National party powerbrokers spending part of election night on Palmer\u2019s yacht have only furthered suggestions that Palmer\u2019s anti-Labor campaign was run in cahoots with the LNP \u2013 and may have damaged the conservative party\u2019s election chances in the process. A former United Australia party north Queensland director, Jen Sackley, told Guardian Australia at the outset of the campaign that Palmer\u2019s party had become \u201ca lobby group for the Liberal party in yellow shirts\u201d. The LNP denied any coordination, although the magnate\u2019s links to influential party figures has already become a feature of the party\u2019s post-election reckoning. \u201cThat image of them with Clive made a mockery of the notion we are political rivals,\u201d an LNP member said. \u201cYou would never see anyone from Labor having drinks with the Greens on election night.\u201d When asked about Palmer\u2019s death tax claims during the campaign, the LNP leader, Deb Frecklington, refused to condemn the claims. \u201cIt has absolutely nothing to do with the LNP, I\u2019ve never met the man and I have no intention to,\u201d Frecklington said on 27 October. Angus said Palmer\u2019s standing in Queensland \u2013 influenced by the collapse of Queensland Nickel, ongoing court battles and his attempt to open the state border \u2013 might have meant his efforts to attack Labor backfired. \u201cMany of the adverts he was running featured his wife \u2026 They came across as uncharismatic. \u201cPalmer himself was missing, you didn\u2019t see his face everywhere, which is against the kind of bluster and bravado he\u2019s had in the past.\u201d Palmer now has few friends in the re-elected government, whose members have been emboldened to take him on. Labor complained to Facebook and Twitter about his advertising during the campaign and senior party figures have flagged the need for new laws to prevent disinformation and large spending by third parties like Mineralogy. \u201cThere needs to be major reform of political advertising and we need to look seriously at the registration of what I call pretend parties like the Palmer party,\u201d Labor\u2019s federal president, Wayne Swan, said on election night. \u201cWe need new rules to knock out pretend parties.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
