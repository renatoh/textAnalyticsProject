The Liverpool manager remains the Italian club's preferred choice to lead them from this summer, as has been the case since they sacked Ciro Ferrara and installed Zaccheroni as a stop-gap appointment in January, when Ben\u00edtez was reluctant to walk away from his lucrative Anfield contract mid-season. Juventus still believe they can entice the Spaniard to Turin, however, but want assurances of his interest as they plan for a new era that will include increased transfer spending this summer and, in the 2011-12 season, a new 41,000-capacity stadium. Reports in Italy have claimed Ben\u00edtez's agent, Manuel Garcia Quilon, met the Juventus president, Jean-Claude Blanc, in Milan this week to discuss the compensation owing to his client should he quit Anfield. While this is incorrect, Juventus do want an answer from Ben\u00edtez on whether he wishes to feature on their managerial shortlist for this summer. Other candidates are believed to include the current Brazil coach, Dunga, and the Cagliari coach, Massimiliano Allegri. Ben\u00edtez is also under consideration by Real Madrid, as the club he served as player, youth-team coach, reserve-team coach and assistant manager discuss the options to replace the current coach, Manuel Pellegrini, should he fail to win La Liga this season. In a poll conducted by the Spanish newspaper Marca yesterday, Ben\u00edtez finished above Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Fabio Capello, Carlo Ancelotti and Luiz Felipe Scolari on the list of readers' ideal choice to succeed Pellegrini. The Liverpool manager polled 40% of a 100,000-strong vote. Despite firm interest from Real and Juventus, a poor season with Liverpool and his public frustrations with the financial constraints at Anfield, Ben\u00edtez would prefer to remain on Merseyside providing serious investment materialises in the coming months. Liverpool's managing director, Christian Purslow, has been conducting a global search for new investors since last year but theco-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett, in the absence of an offer that meets their asking price, have sought an extension to their refinancing deal with the Royal Bank of Scotland. An announcement on the Americans' plans for Liverpool, to include confirmation of their intention to sell and the appointment of the British Airways chairman, Martin Broughton, as the club's new independent chairman, is expected today, the eve of the 21st anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. Fernando Torres, meanwhile, could be fit to face his former club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Europa League semi-final next week, according to the specialist treating the striker's latest knee injury in Spain. Torres is currently in Barcelona for treatment on the knee that required surgery and forced him to miss five weeks of the season earlier this year. Initial scans on a problem that caused Torres to miss Sunday's damaging draw against Fulham proved inconclusive and he is scheduled to undergo further tests tomorrow. The delay in diagnosing the extent of the striker's injury has raised concerns over a prolonged absence and a possible threat to his participation at the World Cup. Dr Ramon Cugat, the specialist who has treated Torres throughout his career, however, believes Liverpool's leading goalscorer should be available for next week's reunion with Atl\u00e9tico. \"The problem is not serious but he needs to rest to avoid more risk because it's the same knee on which he had surgery in January,\" said Cugat. \"But in normal circumstances, he could be ready to play next week, depending on how it settles down. The decision is now up to Liverpool's medical staff and the manager.\" Liverpool play West Ham at Anfield on Monday and face Atl\u00e9tico in the first leg of their semi-final in Madrid three days later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
