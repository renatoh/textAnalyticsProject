He has been hired by Manchester City football club as their press chief and will be bringing with him a wide range of contacts in the sports world, including Des Lynam, Gabby Logan and Paul Gascoigne, one of ITV's controversial World Cup pundits in 2000. \"It is a fantastic opportunity to be back in sport working for a great club,\" he said. Mr Tyrrell, 37, a former journalist, returned to his native Merseyside in July last year to take up a post of communications director for the Merseyside fire service. Few expected him to stay in the position very long given his lifelong association with media and sport. At ITV he handled some of the network's biggest sports stories, including the defection of Des Lynam from the BBC and ITV's victory over the BBC in the battle for Premiership highlights, followed by the crashing disaster of the 7pm scheduling of the same show last year. Mr Tyrrell began his journalistic career on the Liverpool Echo and worked for the South China Morning Post during Chris Patten's first year as governor of Hong Kong in 1992. He moved to Granada a year later, where he rose to head the press operation under Sally Ryle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
