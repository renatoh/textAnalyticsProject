In the words of the Boston Globe: \"The TED Talks program single-handedly popularised the phenomenon of brainy programming.\" While access to TED conferences is exclusive - tickets are $4,500 and you can only apply, rather than buy - the conference's web policy is the reverse; high-quality, professional videos of each speaker and duly edited and distributed inline, and in an embeddable format that guarantees they become top blogging fodder. TED's videos are streamed an average 5.5m times each month, and though the conference only began to put its videos online two years ago there is already a rich archive of 300 speakers that are also distributed through the iTunes Store, YouTube and others. Here's a favourite from last year: Jeff Han and his touchscreen technology. What began as a US phenomenon is now spreading. After a tentative trial in Oxford in 2005, TED announced tonight it is coming back to the city next July, an a Bono-studded event at Tate Modern tonight revealed the speakers we can expect. This isn't a one-off, but the start of a regular, annual TED event in Oxford - and more are planned. July is a very long way off, but here's the initial speaker list, as a taster - under the conference theme 'The Substance of Things Not Seen'. The idea is to attack the subject from many very different perspectives: \u2022 Ian McEwan \u2022 Janine Benyus \u2022 Anish Kapoor \u2022 Paulo Coelho \u2022 Chimamanda Adichie \u2022 Ross Lovegrove \u2022 Bjarke Ingels \u2022 Misha Glenny \u2022 Loretta Napoleoni \u2022 Stefan Sagmeister \u2022 Daniel Birnbaum \u2022 Rory Sutherland \u2022 Cary Fowler \u2022 David Deutsch \u2022 Dan Pink \u2022 David de Rothschild Why Oxford? \"It's easy to reach, but not too easy to leave,\" said Bruno Guissani, TED's European director. TED did not want a conference in London that some people might drop in and out of all day. (To be fair, you're unlikely to bunk off if you've paid $4,500, but let's not be picky...) \"Oxford is a city of competition and attainment, a place of change and discussion and knowledge. And it is a place where worlds were invented, from Lord of the Rings to Alice in Wonderland and Philip Pullman. That is what TED is about.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
