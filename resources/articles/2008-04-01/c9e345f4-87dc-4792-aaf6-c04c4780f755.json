It means Leeds are unable to catch Worcester in the table and return to National League One after a single season in the top flight. Gloucester's win, which featured a hat-trick of tries from Fiji flanker Akapusi Qera, sealed their place in the play-offs where they are favourites to get home advantage. The Premiership leaders were expected to cruise past Leeds quickly and, after a period of softening up, it looked like the rout was about to start when Qera drove over the line, presenting Ryan Lamb with a simple conversion. Yet the visitors battled back and twice managed to get within one point of Gloucester. The pack presented Argentine fly-half Alberto di Bernardo with two penalty chances that he accepted and, after Lamb had booted a penalty in front of the posts, Di Bernardo landed a 40-yard drop goal. Leeds deserved the points, but just before the half-hour a missed tackle as Qera burst through the middle from the halfway line turned the match towards the Cherry and Whites. The Fijian was brought to ground 20 yards from the line but the France hooker Olivier Azam grabbed the ball and regained the momentum to crash over under a pile of bodies next to the posts. After the interval Gloucester were far superior and two scores in three minutes sealed Leeds' fate. Both came from Lamb as the England Under-21 fly-half landed a penalty before intercepting a sloppy pass to race over unopposed from 40 yards. From there, it was all about gaining the four-try bonus point for Gloucester and it came on the hour when the outstanding Qera drove over from an attacking line-out just after Leeds replacement Vili Ma'asi was sent to the sin bin for illegally holding back Will James. Qera got his third try on 68 minutes, which Lamb converted, while replacement Darren Edwards got a consolation try at the end for Leeds as Gloucester eased off.
