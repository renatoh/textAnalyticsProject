The ABC\u2019s news director, Gaven Morris, said the decision was \u201creally disappointing\u201d and a blow to press freedom and the public\u2019s right to know. \u201cFor all Australians who are interested in what goes on inside their democracy these sorts of rulings are a blow to the way Australians have access to information in their society,\u201d Morris said outside the court in Sydney. \u201cUrgent law reform is clearly required.\u201d The ABC is considering appealing the judgment, which found the AFP\u2019s raid on the ABC was legal. \u201cCompared to many other western democracies it is recognised that Australia\u2019s access to information is nowhere near the standard it should be,\u201d Morris said. The managing director of the ABC, David Anderson, said the ruling was further evidence of the urgent need for explicit protections for public interest journalism and for whistleblowers. Anderson said the accuracy of the stories that prompted this raid, the Afghan Files, which reported allegations of unlawful killings and misconduct by Australian special forces in Afghanistan, had never been challenged. \u201cNo one has been able to demonstrate a direct threat to national security as a result of those stories,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the AFP executed its search warrant here at the ABC last June 5th, its raid was seen \u2013 internationally \u2013 for exactly what it was: an attempt to intimidate journalists for doing their jobs. \u201cNot just the journalists named on the search warrant, but all journalists. \u201cThe ABC challenged the validity of the AFP\u2019s search warrant and we\u2019re disappointed by today\u2019s ruling. \u201cThis ruling highlights the serious problem with Australia\u2019s secrecy laws. Australia has by far the most onerous secrecy laws of any comparable western democracy \u2013 the UK, US, Canada, New Zealand. \u201cThis is at odds with our expectation that we live in an open and transparent society. \u201cWe are not saying journalists should be above the law. We\u2019re saying the public\u2019s right to know should be a factor that is taken into account \u2013 and legitimate journalism should not be criminalised. \u201cYet almost three years after those stories were published, investigative journalists Sam Clark and Dan Oakes remain in limbo. They could be charged and prosecuted at any time for doing their jobs.\u201d The ABC warrant named the reporters Oakes and Clark, as well as Morris. The ABC\u2019s chair, Ita Buttrose, said last year the raids by the AFP on its headquarters were \u201cdesigned to intimidate\u201d and warned the government she would fight \u201cany attempts to muzzle\u201d the national broadcaster. Federal court justice Wendy Abraham ordered the ABC to pay costs for both parties. In her reasons for the decision Abraham said the AFP asked the ABC to provide the documents that met the search conditions of the warrant but they declined. \u201cThat would have resulted in the AFP not physically conducting the search and therefore would limit its exposure to matters of concern to the applicant,\u201d she said. \u201cThat approach would have reduced if not alleviated the applicant\u2019s concerns.\u201d Abraham found the AFP tried not to be too intrusive in the execution of the warrant and allowed the ABC\u2019s lawyers to be present throughout the search, which was limited to one room, on a computer operated by ABC staff. \u201cNo other search of the premises was conducted,\u201d she said. Abraham said the federal police agreed to keep all the seized documents on sealed USB sticks and not access them pending a challenge to the validity of the warrant. \u201cFinally, given the communication between the parties, and events leading up to the execution of the warrant, there could have been no doubt that the focus of the warrant was in relation to offences related to the Afghan Files stories,\u201d she said. \u201cMoreover, as noted previously, there has been no challenge to the execution of the warrant. \u201cThe applicant has not established any of the grounds of the application. As such, the application is dismissed with costs.\u201d The decision follows the release on Friday of a review by a former Australian Crime Commission boss, John Lawler, of the AFP\u2019s handling of sensitive investigations which found police had \u201crecognised some shortcomings in investigational governance\u201d and were making changes. \u201cCommunity and stakeholder confidence in the AFP has been negatively impacted as a result of recent sensitive investigations,\u201d Lawler found. \u201cA clear objective of this review is to improve that confidence in, and support for, the AFP\u2019s actions in protecting Australians and Australia\u2019s interests.\u201d Journalist Peter Greste, a spokesman for the Alliance for Journalists\u2019 Freedom, said in the ABC case the AFP used a provision of the Defence Act which made it a criminal offence to receive stolen commonwealth property. \u201cWe acknowledge the important role of the security agencies in protecting national security,\u201d Greste said. \u201cIn seeking to enforce the narrow letter of the law, however, they have undermined the media\u2019s role in maintaining the health of our democracy, and as a result, made the entire system less transparent and less stable.\u201d The federal president of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Marcus Strom, said the decision was another blow to press freedom in Australia. \u201cThe AFP raid on the ABC, and on the home of a News Corporation journalist the day before, are attacks on the public\u2019s right to know about what our governments do in our name,\u201d Strom said. \u201cThe raids came up to two years after the relevant news stories were published and yet the pursuit of the truth tellers continues.\u201d The chair of the Senate inquiry into press freedoms, Sarah Hanson-Young, said whistleblowers and journalists needed proper protection. \u201cThe government should come out today and rule out charging the ABC journalists, and the News Corp journalists involved in other raids,\u201d the Greens senator said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
