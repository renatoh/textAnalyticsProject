National Union of Teachers general secretary Christine Blower told the National Association of Head Teachers conference that the number of teachers who had refused to administer the tests \u2013 formerly known as Sats \u2013 was growing. \"We are hearing that all over the country, 50% of schools \u2013 and counting \u2013 are going to do the boycott.\" In the Lake District, pupils will learn how to build rockets and play rugby in the time they would have spent sitting the national tests, she said. In London, schools have organised a picnic. She said the next challenge would be to boycott the school inspectorate, Ofsted. \"I am sure we could find a way to boycott Ofsted,\" she said. \"We know the level of work caused by Ofsted ... is unreasonable. The Sats boycott is not unconnected with the pressures of Ofsted and data-driven agenda.\" Head teachers face pressure from local authorities and governing bodies, who say their pay can be docked if they refuse to run the tests. One leading head warned yesterday that ministers must stop treating head teachers like football managers by threatening to sack them unless they improve their schools' exam results. School leaders who have dedicated their careers to raising educational achievement are being \"hounded out\" of their posts for falling a few places one year in national league tables, Mike Welsh, president of the NAHT, said. A college set up by government to train headteachers, the National College for Leadership of Schools and Children's Services, preoccupies itself with the \"latest fads\", rather than assist heads, he added. Meanwhile, Welsh said he feared many were switching to teaching because they saw it as a \"safe job\" during the recession, but they lacked the drive to do the job properly. \"Some are looking for shelter in teaching until the storm abates. We must remain a vocational professional with the highest calling,\" he said. \"People are going to turn to whatever job they can get, but teaching is more than a short-term job. We are looking for long-term engagement and people very often under-estimate the workload. They might see it as a safe profession.\" The number of men applying to become teachers rose by almost 50% last year, thought to be fuelled by career-changers reconsidering their jobs in the light of the recession. The total number of would-be trainees increased by more than a third. There was a 52% increase in men wanting to teach primary pupils, the Training and Development Agency for Schools said last month.Today, the schools spokesmen of the three major parties will speak at the conference. School leaders claim Ed Balls, the schools secretary, has urged council education chiefs to instruct governors to deduct pay and take disciplinary action against teachers refusing to administer the tests."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
