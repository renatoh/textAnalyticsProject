The French defender has not featured since limping out of the FA Cup third-round tie against Plymouth in January. Originally it was thought the former Manchester United man would be back in action within a month. However, complications to a niggling tendon injury have delayed the 31-year-old's first-team return. Silvestre completed 90 minutes for Arsenal's second string in the goalless draw at Chelsea on Monday night and has his sights firmly on boosting Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's options ahead of the Champions League quarter-final against Villarreal and an FA Cup semi-final date with Chelsea at Wembley next month. \"It was very good to be back,\" said Silvestre. \"There have been so many big games and the team is doing well, so you want to enjoy that as much as you can and be involved.\" Silvestre told the club's official website: \"I am glad of our progress and hopefully I can join in now.\" Arsenal headed into the international break full of confidence after the 3-1 win at Newcastle extended their unbeaten run in the Barclays Premier League to 16 matches. With the Gunners now back in the top four ahead of a faltering Aston Villa and the captain Cesc F\u00e1bregas as well as Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor expected to be in contention when domestic action resumes, there is a much more positive outlook. Their leading scorer Robin van Persie feels the club is now moving in the right direction once again. \"We are not doing those silly things any more which cost us earlier in the season,\" he said. \"We have to keep on thinking positively all the time, whenever we go on a football pitch. Earlier this season we were not doing that enough but right now we are doing it and look at the results.\" The Holland forward added: \"If we carry on in the same way we will not drop any more silly points and who knows what will happen in the league, the FA Cup and the Champions League? We are certainly coming into great form at just the right time.\" Andrei Arshavin has settled in quickly following his deadline day transfer from Zenit St Petersburg and hinted it could be his last move. The 27-year-old Russian playmaker, currently on international duty preparing for the World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan, scored his first goal for Arsenal in the 4-0 win over Blackburn. \"The players are friendly and I feel comfortable with the team in general,\" Arshavin said, back in Russia for Saturday's World Cup qualifier with Azerbaijan. \"I am pleased to have a long-term contract and I could well finish my career here.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
