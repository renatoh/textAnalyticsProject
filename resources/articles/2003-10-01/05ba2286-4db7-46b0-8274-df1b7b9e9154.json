It was not, however, enough to impress Nafis Iqbal, an 18-year-old who has just finished his A-levels. Not content with flaying the England attack for 118 from 168 deliveries, the tyro cast a withering eye upon the new spin twins, Ashley Giles and Gareth Batty. Asked what he thought about the England attack he stroked his chin like a precocious sage and said: \"The fast bowlers are quite good, actually very good. But the spinners were very much ordinary. I expected them to turn the ball more than they did. I thought Giles might be more effective than he was.\" The immediate reaction to all this was that young Nafis must have seen very little of England in recent Tests. There are many admirable reasons why Giles is picked to play for England - control, accuracy, bounce, the recognition that a bat has uses beyond hitting burglars, an unselfish team ethic, the fact that he is Michael Vaughan's best pal in the side. However, he is not renowned for the prodigious amount of spin he puts on a cricket ball and one can imagine him even having difficulty opening a bottle of wine with a corkscrew. Yesterday, however, the pitch scarcely encouraged spin. It was hardly a temptress when it came to swing, bounce or seam movement either. Such is the way with wickets in this part of the world. Giles, the slow left-armer whose figures were 21-7-52-1, and Batty, the off-spinner who returned 17-5-47-1, might as well have been bowling on a sheet of glass. The best bowler, for the second time in two matches on this tour, was Matthew Hoggard, with figures of 11-8-19-1. Fourteen of those runs came from one over as Nafis reached his century by striking the fast bowler over Vaughan at mid-off and immediately hit two further fours. Steve Harmison also caught the eye. This will be a difficult tour for him as he is a man who trades in pace and bounce. He is at his best bowling just back of a length but he does relatively little with the ball. Yesterday, though, he pitched it up more and got some away swing; if he returns from this tour with the ability to reverse swing - a crucial weapon in these conditions - the trip will have been worthwhile. England's assistant coach Mike Watkinson admitted it was a tough day. \"It is very difficult to bowl proficient batsmen out on wickets like this,\" he said, \"no matter what you send down. \"It's a patience game, a matter of getting the ball in the right areas. The top-order batsmen make you work very hard for their wickets. And today the heat was turned up. It was very hot and humid out there.\" England made a good start when Harmison took wickets with the first and last deliveries of a seven-ball over, the sixth of the day on this attractive ground, an hour's hair-raising drive from the centre of Dhaka. First, Javed Omar edged behind and then Aftab Ahmed guided another distinctly sharp delivery to Rikki Clarke at second slip. Nafis and Rajin Saleh (28) then put on a hundred in 30 overs. Once he had reached his hundred Nafis self-destructed, hitting three more fours and jumping down the pitch to loft Batty for a straight six before he was caught by Graham Thorpe at long-on. Nafis captained Bangladesh in the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand two years ago and did enough here to give the local selectors some pencil-chewing problems. The most frustrating time for the England spinners came after tea when they bowled in tandem for 50 minutes without success against Arafat Sunny (25) and Mosaddek Hossain (21). Even Alastair Campbell would have struggled to spin it here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
