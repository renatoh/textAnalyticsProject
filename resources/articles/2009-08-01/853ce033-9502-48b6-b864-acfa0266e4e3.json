A perfect start to their league campaign was extended at Upton Park on Sunday to leave Spurs peering down from the pinnacle. There will be reality checks ahead, perhaps when the fixture calendar asks them to host Manchester United before dispatching them across town to Chelsea in successive September weeks, but a team more used to a tag of under-achievers is suddenly giddy at the top. Tottenham have tended to find themselves wallowing in introspection by the end of August in recent seasons. Since Martin Jol began the 2005-06 campaign with one defeat in 11 Premier League matches, they have consistently stalled in the blocks. It took them a tortuous 11 matches last season to reach the nine points they have after three games this term, and 13 two years ago. On each occasion, it was November before their points tally lurched into double figures with managerial casualties endured en route. Harry Redknapp laughs at talk of emulating Spurs's Double-winning class of 1960-71, but he is already threatening something remarkable at White Hart Lane: this squad might actually be realising their considerable potential. Most would argue it is about time too. There has always been quality at Tottenham's disposal in recent seasons, but only Jol's team, hauled back into fifth place on the final day four seasons ago, have mustered any prolonged consistency. The early season toils thereafter were infuriating, not least because successive new managers have subsequently re-inflated expectations either with silverware \u2013 Juande Ramos's Carling Cup \u2013 or excellent form in the run-in. This season, together with mouth-watering attacking options, they also boast a manager too canny to allow form to dip. Redknapp believes this side can challenge for the top four, regardless of Manchester City's billions and the might of the established elite quartet. Birmingham visit the Lane on Saturday and the possibility of securing 12 points from four games is very real indeed. The current squad has maintained momentum from last year's turnaround, when 30 points were won from the last 16 games to hoist the team from 18th to eighth. \"We have started the season at the same standard we finished the last, an important step,\" said the goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini. \"Definitely, the quality is there. We don't put any limit to what this team can achieve. We have very good players and, probably, the fact we haven't changed a lot has helped us. Apart from Crouchy, the team is pretty much as it was last year, and that is a good thing. Everyone knows each other better and this can be the right thing for having a good season.\" There is a logic to the argument that the current squad are benefiting from continuity. The flurry of managers who have occupied the Spurs dug-out in recent seasons have each recruited heavily to shape the team into their own image. Each transfer window seemed to prompt wholesale change. Indeed, the current incumbent arrived with a reputation as a wheeler dealer having built Portsmouth into a Premier League force largely through his extensive knowledge of the transfer market. Yet, while there were purchases last term aimed at preserving top flight status, this summer has been all about quality rather than quantity. With a week of the window remaining, Tottenham have brought in only Peter Crouch and S\u00e9bastien Bassong as first-teamers, and the young full-backs Kyle Naughton and Kyle Walker from Sheffield United, with disruption within the ranks kept to a relative minimum. There may be further out-goings \u2013 Jermaine Jenas and David Bentley to Aston Villa \u2013 but Redknapp has straight-batted talk of further arrivals. \"Not unless someone pops up who can make a difference to the team,\" he said. He would surely be tempted to strengthen if he could. Spurs have two good players for every position bar, possibly, the left midfield where Luka Modric is currently employed with only the right-footed Bentley or Gareth Bale as back-up. They explored the possibility of bringing Joe Cole or Ashley Young in on that flank. In an ideal world, Spurs would secure Toulouse's Moussa Sissoko having seen a \u00a312m offer already rejected for the France Under-21 international. If the Frenchman is over-priced, then Celtic's Scott Brown may have played himself out of a move against Arsenal at Celtic Park last week. A return to Pompey to prise away Nico Kranjcar is not outlandish. Yet, even if the squad remains as it is, there is a reassuring quality to Redknapp's options. Glenn Hoddle watched this team beat Liverpool on the opening weekend and suggested Spurs boast more depth than last season's runners-up. A glance at the benches revealed as much: Liverpool with Diego Cavalieri, Jay Spearing, Martin Kelly, Andrea Dossena, Daniel Ayala, Andriy Voronin and Yossi Benayoun; Spurs with Cudicini, Jamie O'Hara, Crouch, Roman Pavlyuchenko, Naughton, Bentley and Alan Hutton. That much is encouraging for a team that finished last season closer to the bottom than to fourth place. Tottenham may be on the turn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
