The players had been shown highlights of that great day in the build-up to the match and, no doubt, the forwards coach Anthony Foley relived some of the emotions of that epic occasion. At least the odds were not as heavily stacked against them this time. They needed to score a minimum of four tries and win against one of the French Top 14's biggest spenders to creep into the top eight and book a potential trip to Twickenham to take on the No1 seeds Harlequins. There was also the frisson of pushing the reigning champions Leinster out of the quarter-final equation and reducing the three-time winners to the last eight of the Amlin Challenge Cup. This is not a vintage Munster side but a full house at the home of Munster rugby never wavered in their belief that their men would rise to the big occasion. The new coach, Rob Penny, admits to trying to change the old style and bring in a more adventurous approach. But in times of need it is always best to get back to basics and two of the vital three tries that came in a 15-minute burst before half-time were from driving lineouts. The scrum-half Conor Murray crashed over for the first and the hooker Mike Sherry was driven over for another whereas the dashing Simon Zebo ran in for the first of his hat-trick of tries. That pre-interval burst of 17 unanswered points considerably eased the home fans' nerves and concern was replaced by expectation at the start of the second half. It did not take long for the capacity 26,000 crowd to rise to its feet and twice in the space of seven minutes they got the chance to salute their latest folk hero, Zebo, as he bagged the bonus point and then his hat-trick. That wrapped things up nicely and there was no more scoring over the next 25 minutes \u2013 just as there had not been by Munster in the opening 25. Almost a point a minute in between, however, was just what was needed. It certainly helped Munster that Wayne Barnes ordered off the Racing M\u00e9tro flanker Antoine Battut after five minutes for what was deemed to have been a deliberate knee into Tommy O'Donnell. That made an already difficult afternoon's work all the more problematic for the visitors, who played the final five minutes with 13 men after Masi Matadigo had been sent to the sin-bin. They made light of their difficulties for a short while, taking the lead with the first of two Ga\u00ebtan Germain penalties in the opening half, but once the tries began to flow they were all at sea. \"We knew what we had to do going into the game and there were definitely some nerves flying around. We knew we had to score tries early on and after the first 20 minutes we got into a flow,\" said Zebo. \"We were confident in our own abilities and in the end it was a great win. It will be a big ask to go to Twickenham and beat Harlequins but we owe them one after what happened at Thomond Park in the Amlin Challenge Cup a few years ago.\" Munster have once again proved they have the will to win against the odds but will they have the firepower to match the English champions up front? That will be the big question for Penny and Foley as they prepare for the quarter-finals. And if it comes down to a question of style, perhaps the tried and trusted methods of yesteryear will be the requirement for the day. Bring on the world renowned Munster driving maul.
