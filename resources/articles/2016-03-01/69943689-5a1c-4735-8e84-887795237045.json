A comprehensive 5-1 aggregate defeat against Borussia Dortmund means that Spurs have just eight Premier League matches remaining this season, in which they will attempt to overhaul Leicester and bring home a first title since Bill Nicholson\u2019s Double-winning side 55 years ago. Bournemouth are the visitors to White Hart Lane but Pochettino knows his side can\u2019t afford any slip-ups with so little of the campaign remaining and Leicester eight points ahead at kick-off on Sunday after Saturday\u2019s 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace. \u201cI think now we are focused on the Premier League and all our energies will go into trying to win games and win the league,\u201d said Pochettino. \u201cIt\u2019s true that there are no distractions now, until now we had the Europa League to play, but now we only have the Premier League. We need to realise that our target was to try to reduce the gap to the top four but we are second in the table now, and we have played one tie more than last season in the Europa League. \u201cIt\u2019s true it\u2019s tough. We are the youngest squad in the Premier League and the players need to feel what it means to play for the Premier League, to play to win, play to try to compete in different competitions. We need to learn \u2026 should learn a lot from this season and now we need to try in the last eight games to try to win as many points as possible.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s 5-1 victory at Bournemouth in October sparked a six-match unbeaten run in the Premier League that took Pochettino\u2019s side into the top four. Since then, Eddie Howe\u2019s side have virtually assured their place in next season\u2019s top flight thanks to three successive victories over Southampton, Newcastle and Swansea. Pochettino is certainly taking nothing for granted but praised the mentality of his young squad to cope with the demands of the title run-in. \u201cBournemouth have shown they have improved a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a very good team, they run a lot, they have very good organisation, they have a manager I admire, he always tries to play on the grass, he has a very good philosophy about football. \u201cThe mentality of our squad is fantastic. It\u2019s amazing. I feel very proud of them, it\u2019s been a very tough season and the answer was fantastic from the squad. I feel very proud and happy of all the players and the way we have improved in these eight months.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
