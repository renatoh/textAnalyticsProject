Krychowiak followed Emery to PSG in July last year for \u20ac30m after spending the previous two seasons playing under him at Sevilla, where they won the Europa League in 2015 and 2016. Krychowiak said at the time of his transfer that Emery\u2019s appointment at PSG was a factor in his decision but the Poland international started only 11 matches in all competitions for the French club and was told in the summer he should look for a new team, only 12 months after signing a five-year contract. With Krychowiak marginalised to the point that he was not involved in any pre\u2011season friendlies for PSG, West Bromwich Albion saw an unlikely window of opportunity and signed the midfielder at the end of August on a season-long loan deal that was regarded as a huge coup. Krychowiak has settled quickly at The Hawthorns and is enjoying English football, yet he is clearly frustrated with the way things unravelled for him at PSG, in particular Emery\u2019s responses whenever he sought an explanation. \u201cI spoke with the coach but every time when I spoke with him I felt deception,\u201d Krychowiak said. Asked to elaborate on that and whether he felt he was not being told the truth during their conversations about his lack of match action, Krychowiak said: \u201cYes, exactly. So for me I didn\u2019t understand why. The coach knows me very well. We spent two years together and before I signed the contract he told me to come to PSG, and I didn\u2019t play.\u201d Krychowiak is open to all possibilities at the end of this season and has not ruled out returning to PSG, although that prospect appears highly unlikely in the circumstances. His move to Albion came out of the blue \u2013 he found out about the opportunity of playing in England 48 hours before he signed \u2013 and the 27-year-old is honest enough to admit he knew \u201cnot a lot\u201d about the Midlands club before signing. Playing in the Premier League was part of the attraction, according to Krychowiak, as was the need to hold down a regular first-team place before next summer\u2019s World Cup finals. \u201cIt was one of the reasons,\u201d Krychowiak said, when asked about Russia 2018 being a factor. \u201cIf I want to play for Poland, I need to play and find a club. I didn\u2019t go for the two last games with Poland [in September\u2019s qualifiers]. I spoke with the coach, he told me that it would be better that I find a club, then I will be back [in the squad]. So it was very important for me to have the opportunity to play in the World Cup.\u201d A keen traveller, Krychowiak spent the summer trekking across the US as well as visiting Mexico and Cuba, and he has already taken in a few diverse attractions in England, including visiting Blenheim Palace, Legoland and the historic colleges that make up Oxford University. \u201cFootball players have a lot of opportunity to change the club, the city, the country, to know a new culture,\u201d Krychowiak said. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to discover these kind of places.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
