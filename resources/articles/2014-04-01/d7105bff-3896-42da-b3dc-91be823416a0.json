The attempt to cling on to a place in the elite division, which was so long in coming, has been undermined by constant noises off, with the club's Malaysian owner, Vincent Tan, rebranding the Bluebirds in red, seeking to change the club's name, sacking the popular manager who got them into the Premier League and trying to have the recent defeat by Crystal Palace overturned on the flimsiest of grounds. \"Spygate\", as they are cornily cornily calling the way in which the Cardiff team was allegedly leaked to Palace in advance, has seen Tan and company demand an investigation by the Premier League in a five-page letter. Not so much James Bond as Basildon Bond then. It is against this overwrought background that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his team travel to Sunderland next Sunday for a match which could effectively relegate one of the two clubs. Both have resurrected their chances of escaping the bottom three by taking four points from the past two games: Cardiff by winning at Southampton and drawing with Stoke on Saturday, Sunderland by gaining an unlikely point at Manchester City and then raising eyebrows everywhere by beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. This after five successive defeats. Solskjaer said: \"Next weekend is a proper cup final \u2013 of the same importance to both sides and the same mental test for both. It's a massive game for us and we will prepare as if it's the last game we will ever play.\" The Cardiff manager, whose team have 30 points, believes they need five from their final three matches to survive. \"I don't think 34 will be enough,\" he said. \"Thirty five might be and 36 will be.\" Stoke's visit was a microcosm of Cardiff's season, featuring the now familiar \"We'll always be blue\" protest against the owner, the booing of Tan's name, the concession of yet another soft goal, a frantic fightback and more heroics in goal from the excellent David Marshall. What was different was the award of two penalties by the referee Howard Webb. Cardiff had neither gained nor conceded one all season and then, like the proverbial omnibus, a couple came together. Both were disputed by the respective managers but replays vindicated England's World Cup referee in each case. Kim Bo-kyung needlessly stuck out a leg for Peter Odemwingie to fall over for the first, tucked away by Marko Arnautovic. For the second Steven Nzonzi impeded Fraizer Campbell in similar fashion for Peter Whittingham to equalise. Cardiff thought they had won it when a shot from Steven Caulker rebounded off an upright for Juan Cala to force the ball over the line, but the Spaniard was offside and it was Stoke who would have banked all three points at the death but for two top-notch saves by Marshall, denying Odemwingie and Oussama Assaidi. Even the man regarded by some as the best goalkeeper in the league was helpless in added time when Jonathan Walters rattled his crossbar from distance. Some mid-table teams may be on the beach, mentally, at this stage (Newcastle spring readily to mind), but Stoke are not among them and it is to Mark Hughes' credit that they continue to give their all in spirited pursuit of what would be their first top-10 finish in the Premier League. \"That's our target and this is another point towards it,\" Hughes said. \"We have two home games coming up [against Tottenham and Fulham] which will really help because our home form in the second half of the season has been outstanding.\" Solskjaer accepts that Norwich are the team Cardiff must overhaul if they are to stay up, but he opted not to watch their televised match against Liverpool. He said: \"I have my family over from Norway, they are travelling back on Monday so I'm not going to waste two hours during which I can't control anything.\" Man of the match David Marshall (Cardiff City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
