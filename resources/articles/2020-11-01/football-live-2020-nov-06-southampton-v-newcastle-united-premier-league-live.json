Thanks for your company and your emails and tweets. I\u2019ll leave you with another plug for Ben\u2019s report: Here\u2019s Theo Walcott: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely fantastic achievement,\u201d he says of their lofty perch. \u201cTo be part of this is an absolute honour.\u201d He sounds like he\u2019s enjoying his football again, and why not? Here\u2019s Ben Fisher\u2019s on-the-whistle report from St Mary\u2019s. Well, that was about as emphatic as a 2-0 can get. Southampton were probably worth double that. For Newcastle it\u2019s a night to forget. Peep! PEEP! PEEEEEEP!!! All over at St Mary\u2019s Southampton go top of the top tier for the first time in 32 years! 90+3 min: So close to 3-0! Armstrong hammers a shot at goal and Darlow almost makes a mess of things as the ball dips dangerously. 90+2 min: Southampton are happy enough just to pop the ball around and run out time. 90 min: A minimum of three minutes to be added. 89 min: Sean Longstaff goes into the book for a clothesline-from-hell on Ward-Prowse. Newcastle are at the point where they just want this evening to end. 88 min: Another change for Saints: Walcott off, Long on. 86 min: What a save! McCarthy has had almost nothing to do all evening yet he springs across to claw away Joelinton\u2019s brilliant header from Lewis\u2019s vicious cross. 83 min: Walcott, who has been excellent, roars forward from halfway with Newcastle players trailing after him like a tail on a comet. He loses possession on the edge of the box but Sean Longstaff is horrendously sloppy on the edge of the box \u2013 Armstrong nips the ball away, shimmies himself a yard of shooting space, and fires low past Darlow. That should be that. Finally. 80 min: Saint-Maximin gets gingerly to his feet after a collision with Bednarek but seems OK to carry on. 78 min: Steve Bruce rolls the dice and Newcastle make a double substitution. Carroll replaces the ineffectual Wilson, Joelinton is on for Murphy. 77 min: Walcott is OK to continue. 76 min: Lascelles certainly got a faint flick on the ball, which is probably what saved him despite his follow-through taking him forcefully into the attacker. 75 min: Lascelles makes a recovery tackle as Armstrong rolls the ball into the onrushing Walcott. Walcott has taken a whack \u2026 but VAR says no. Though the replays look a bit, well, penaltyish. 74 min: Saint-Maximin looks to dink a pass in to Almiron, who has made a burst forward, but it\u2019s touch too heavy. 73 min: Redmond replaces Djenepo for Southampton. 71 min: Fernandez gets a vital foot in and Walcott looks to latch on to Djenepo\u2019s pass, but the latter wins a free-kick over on the Southampton left. 70 min: \u2026 Murphy pings his effort into the foreheads of those in the wall. 69 min: Armstrong handles 25 yards from his own goal. Dangerous free-kick this for the visitors \u2026 67 min: Saint-Maximin gets a rare touch of the ball but is crowded out by four Southampton defenders. 65 min: Newcastle finally get a foothold and some possession. Though Matty Longstaff\u2019s errant pass puts an end to that. 63 min: \u2026 fine save from Darlow! Bednarek meets Ward-Prowse\u2019s corner at the near post but his header is pawed away by the goalkeeper. 62 min: Armstrong can\u2019t quite find Walcott in the middle. It\u2019s another corner. A second Saints goal feels inevitable at this point \u2026 61 min: And speaking of jeffing, Jeff Hendrick\u2019s evening is over \u2013 Matty Longstaff comes on to replace him in the Newcastle engine room. 60 min: Ward-Prowse rumbles forward this time and feeds Djenepo. He goes down under Murphy\u2019s challenge but the referee waves away the penalty shouts. Cue much audible effing and jeffing. 59 min: Pass, pass, pass from Southampton. Passpasspasspasspass. 57 min: Djenepo wins his team yet another corner (after an offside call that would very much have been VARed had he scored). But the corner comes to nothing so no harm done. 55 min: Feels like Newcastle need to do something to change the flow of the game. Time for a bit of Andy Carroll? 54 min: Adams does well to hold the ball up and slips it through to Armstrong, who is offside. 52 min: Romeu hits the bar! His thunderous effort from distance is brilliantly tipped onto the woodwork by Darlow. 51 min: \u2026 how has this stayed out?!? Vestergaard has a free header at the back post but inexplicably heads across goal. It drops to Bednarek who hammers the ball at goal where it is headed off the line by Lascelles. 50 min: Romeu\u2019s effort is blocked but Saints have another corner \u2026 49 min: Walcott, dropping deep as he has done to great effect throughout, picks up the ball, thunks a shot at goal and watches the deflection drift just wide. Corner \u2026 48 min: Neither side seem to want the ball very much at the moment. 46 min: Djenepo skitters at the Newcastle defence but his run is halted on the edge of the area. Peep! Off we go again then. A half-time email: \u201cAs a Newcastle fan I am always a nervous wreck whenever Fabian Sch\u00e4r is in the side against a team who press well,\u201d writes Shaun Wilkinson. \u201cThe guy is about 30% as good as he thinks he is and he always seems to be waiting for someone to take his picture when he is on the ball. He massively got away with one there against Che Adams.\u201d And here\u2019s some reading for the interval: Peep! PEEEEP! Half-time and Southampton have a deserved lead. Their only frustration will be that they\u2019ve not got a bigger advantage. Still, as it stands, they\u2019re heading top. 45 min: The referee blows for a foul on Schar who goes down under pressure from Adams. That was very, very soft and Adams would\u2019ve been in had it not been given. 44 min: It\u2019s not quite Ward-Prowse territory but he takes it, swinging the ball into the six yard box where Darlow punches away. 43 min: Lewis gets his feet tangled and Walcott whips the ball away. Fernandez slides in and concedes a free-kick on the corner of the box. He\u2019s booked. 42 min: So close to 2-0! Djenepo does wonderfully to flick on Ward-Prowse\u2019s pass, Walcott shimmies a yard of space but curls his shot just wide. That should\u2019ve been two. 40 min: \u201cI\u2019m not an effing ballboy mate,\u201d says someone on the sidelines as Stephens readies to take a throw-in. Sounded like the cameraman! 38 min: Wilson and Saint-Maximin haven\u2019t really had a kick yet. Southampton\u2019s backline have been well protected by the midfield. 36 min: \u201cToo far AWAY!\u201d comes the scream from the touchline, presumably aimed at Newcastle players who aren\u2019t pressing tight enough. 34 min: \u2026 which isn\u2019t a particularly great one from Ward-Prowse. Schar clears. 33 min: Fernandez gives the ball away oh-so-cheaply 30 yards from his own goal and he\u2019s a touch fortunate that all Southampton earn from it is a corner \u2026 32 min: A storming run by Murphy earns Newcastle 50, 60 yards on the right but Ward-Prowse battles back to end the attack. 31 min: \u201cHey, foul!\u201d shouts Che Adams as the ball rolls out of play for a goal kick. Nothing doing. 29 min: A lovely little flick from Armstrong has Ward-Prowse bearing down on the Newcastle back four but the England midfielder\u2019s pass is straight to a defender. That was a missed opportunity. 27 min: Newcastle break and Romeu thunders into Saint-Maximin to concede a free-kick and pick up the first yellow card of the game. 26 min: Djenepo sees his shot blocked on the edge of the area. 24 min: Good work from Almiron on this occasion, nipping the ball away from the onrushing Armstrong. 23 min: Much better this time from Lewis and Longstaff really should score but plants his header straight at McCarthy from eight yards out. 22 min: Newcastle work the ball out from the back nicely but Lewis\u2019s cross is a bit hit-and-hope. 20 min: Another Newcastle corner is swung in by Longstaff but it\u2019s a mis-hit to the near post and Saints clear. 19 min: \u2026 a bit of a flap from McCarthy but Lascelles can only glance the ball on rather than head at goal. 17 min: Stephens\u2019 pass from the back is a poor one and is returned with interest straight to the feet of Callum Wilson. He should probably have a go himself but looks to feed Saint-Maximin and his pass is a poor one. Still, corner \u2026 15 min: Romeu and Ward-Prowse are beginning to run the midfield, with Longstaff and Hendrick chasing shadows at the moment. 13 min: Romeu bundles Hendrick off the ball in midfield and releases Walcott. He skitters forward dangerously but his shot from 25 yards is wild and wide. 11 min: The goal has put a spring in Southampton\u2019s step \u2013 Romeu finds space for a cross and finds Adams, who is also able to wriggle free though his shot lacks power. 10 min: Steve Bruce will be fuming \u2013 that wasn\u2019t just Southampton\u2019s first attack but the first time they\u2019ve really had the ball in Newcastle\u2019s half. 8 min: What a strike that was from Che Adams. He had just forced Darlow into a flying save with an effort from the edge of the box. Almiron picked up the loose ball and should really have cleared but a combo of Walcott and Walker-Peters picked his pocket. Walcott chipped a cross to Adams, who thundered his volley home. Well they\u2019ve got a foothold now! 6 min: Southampton are really struggling to get a foothold so far, Newcastle\u2019s press is working well. 4 min: Newcastle build the first thing resembling an attack, with Djenepo working hard to get back and deny Murphy space on the right. 3 min: It\u2019s been a very scrappy opening couple of minutes, with both sides feeling their way into the game. 2 min: Another huge bang precedes Jeff Hendrick losing the ball in midfield. 1 min: A load of fireworks are being set off outside the ground, which adds a certain \u201catmosphere\u201d to the opening seconds. Peep! Off we go then. Newcastle get us under way. And we have a minute of silence ahead of Remembrance Sunday. Click-clack, click-clack \u2026 the players are in the tunnel. Newcastle are resplendent in bright yellow. Here\u2019s Tumaini\u2019s match report from the Amex: It\u2019s full-time just along the south coast in Brighton, where the home side have been held to a 0-0 draw by visiting Burnley. The Clarets will be the happier with a point but that\u2019s four games without a goal for Sean Dyche\u2019s side. A bit of pre-match reading: James Ward-Prowse gets into the nitty-gritty of his free-kick technique with David Hytner: Amid all these ponderings about Saints going top, it should be remembered that Steve Bruce\u2019s Newcastle have had a very decent start of their own and would catapult themselves into the top four and above the home side with a win of their own. And Newcastle have had the upper hand between these teams in the last few years \u2013 they won at St Mary\u2019s in March to complete a Premier League double and haven\u2019t lost on a visit to Southampton since 2016. So Newcastle are unchanged from the win over Everton, while Southampton make a couple of changes \u2013 Ings and Bertrand are both out injured so Stephens and Djenepo come in. Southampton: McCarthy, Walker-Peters, Vestergaard, Stephens, Bednarek, Romeu, Ward-Prowse, Armstrong, Djenepo, Walcott, Adams. Subs: Forster, Ramsay, Diallo, Tella, Redmond, Long, N\u2019Lundulu. Newcastle: Darlow, Murphy, Sch\u00e4r, Lascelles, Fern\u00e1ndez, Lewis, Hendrick, Longstaff, Almir\u00f3n, Saint-Maximin, Wilson. Subs: Gillespie, Clark, M Longstaff, Carroll, Joelinton, Hayden, Manquillo. Chris Nicholl, Ian Branfoot, Alan Ball, the Great Escape, Dave Merrington, the Great Escape II (Electric Boogaloo), Graeme Souness, Egil Ostenstad, Ali Dia, the Great Escape III (the Search for Spock), Dave Jones, Marian Pahars, the Great Escape IV (A New Hope), Glenn Hoddle, Stuart Gray, farewell to the Dell, Gordon Strachan, Paul Sturrock, Steve Wigley, Harry Redknapp, relegation, that weird time with Clive Woodward, George Burley, Gareth Bale, Nigel Pearson, Jan Poortvliet, Mark Wotte, relegation (again), administration, Alan Pardew, Rickie Lambert, JPT glory, Nigel Adkins, back-to-back promotions, Mauricio Pochettino, Ronald Koeman, Sadio Man\u00e9, the Europa League (play-offs), Claude Puel, Mauricio Pellegrino, Virgil van Dijk, Mark Hughes, the Great Escape V (The Final Frontier), and that 9-0 \u2013 quite a lot has happened at Southampton since the Saints last marched to the tippity top of the top-flight table. But tonight they can hit those heights again for the first time in 32 years. Victory over Newcastle at St Mary\u2019s will send Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side to the summit but they will have to win this battle of the surprise packages without Danny Ings, who could be facing six weeks on the sidelines with a knee injury. Kick off is 8pm GMT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
