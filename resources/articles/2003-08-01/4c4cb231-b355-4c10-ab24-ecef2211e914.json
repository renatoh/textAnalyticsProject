In New Zealand's win in Dunedin on Saturday, which saw the All Blacks clinch the Tri-nations title, near-freezing conditions in the evening made handling difficult, despite cloudless skies over the previous four days meaning ground conditions were perfect for a daylight Test. With Dunedin enjoying a spell of good weather, both sides prepared for the Test on firm training grounds in the sun, hardly conducive to playing in the cold with a wet ball. \"It makes for a long day and a late night,\" the All Blacks skipper Reuben Thorne said before the game. \"We'd all enjoy a change, but I don't think it will get to that point. Everyone knows how we feel.\" The All Blacks assistant coach Robbie Deans has long been an advocate for returning to afternoon Tests and the South African winger Stefan Terblanche said night games gave the All Blacks an advantage because they were used to the cold and the wet. \"The culture I come from says at three o'clock you play a game and at five o'clock you're out on the field having a braai [barbecue],\" he said. However, the current scheduling set-up is set to continue. With television revenue at stake courtesy of live broadcasts at respectable early morning hours in Britain, South Africa and late afternoon in Australia, the New Zealand Rugby Union are unlikely to alter the kick-offs. The victory means a second successive Tri-nations championship for the All Blacks, with one fixture - a Bledisloe Cup match against Australia - still to play in Auckland next Saturday. New Zealand won 50-21 in Sydney a fortnight ago but will only wrest the Bledisloe Trophy back from the Wallabies for the first time since 1997 if they complete the double at Eden Park. Placed under consistent pressure from a resurgent Springboks outfit, New Zealand had to rely on the boot of Carlos Spencer on Saturday. The Auckland fly-half did not miss a kick, landing 14 points from four penalties and a conversion to Joe Rokocoko's fifth-minute try. The Springboks remained in touch throughout, from the moment Richard Bands scored one of the great prop- forward tries after a quarter of an hour. Bursting on to a popped pass, Bands rampaged 40 metres, through the tackle of Spencer, before carrying Aaron Mauger with him across the line for his first Test try. Louis Koen missed the conversion but landed two penalties for the Springboks, whose reputation, despite the defeat, was given a boost after they arrived in New Zealand under a disciplinary cloud. After Rokocoko had chased down Mauger's grubber kick to score his 11th try in just six Tests, South Africa kept up the pressure, shutting down the centres quickly and restricting the All Blacks' opportunities to get the ball wide.
