But then this is a man who is used to going on journeys. When he appeared briefly for Hampshire earlier in the season, it was the fifth county he had played for in a career that has redefined peripatetic. Thirty later this month, he is playing only his third Test and yesterday he registered his second hundred, following a debut ton in Johannesburg earlier in the year. So much for Australia's lost generation. North began his second innings against England Lions at Worcester 10 days ago knowing that another failure, to go with tour scores of one, 11 and one, would set tongues wagging. He promptly ground out an unbeaten 191 and he has now added 125 not out. Australia's chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch, recently said North had been watched closely for eight years while playing for Western Australia, without ever showing that he was made of the right stuff. Presumably he has earned a breather for the time being. North's skill these past two innings has been to make the bowlers feel they aren't being made to look foolish. Time and again he ushered Jimmy Anderson's offerings through outside off stump, and even at the end, with Australia waiting for Brad Haddin to complete a knife-twisting century of his own, North was quietly defending Graeme Swann to midwicket. In all he saw off 173 dot balls and nudged 42 singles in just over six hours, leaving what frivolity there was to Michael Clarke, who helped him add 143, and Haddin, who shared in a stand of 200. \"We saw the opportunity to keep them in the field for 180 overs or so, and it was pretty hard for them,\" said North, who once made a double-century here for Durham. \"Having experienced a lot of county cricket, there were no surprises for me in terms of the conditions, the weather or the facilities.\" Ricky Ponting promised with chilling certainty last week that Australia would have their game faces on in time for the Tests, and North's own mask has been cast straight from his captain's mould. If Australia's 2005 tourists were undone in part by a refusal to accept that England could bowl as well as they did, the current bunch possess the kind of grim-faced pragmatism that informed the retaliatory whitewash in 2006-07. Only the dashing left-handed opener Phillip Hughes bucks the trend, and even Clarke \u2013 who can entertain with the best of them \u2013 was a model of decorum during his 83 on Friday. But North embodies the asceticism that could yet be Ponting's route to a cherished series win in England. There was a pull for four off Anderson that brought up the 500, and a hoick over mid-on off Monty Panesar shortly after they had passed 600. But otherwise, substance won over style. Anoraks were reduced to pointing out that no player who shared a name with a compass point had ever played Test cricket, let alone scored a hundred on his Ashes debut, but North was the headline rather than a pun \u2013 the lynchpin of Australia's second wave of remorselessness after Ponting and Simon Katich had put on 239 for the second wicket. By the end, with England doing little more than waiting for Ponting to put them out of their misery, the Australians had made their highest Ashes total since 1934, when they racked up 701 at The Oval. Back then, English hearts were broken chiefly by two men: Bill Ponsford made 266, Don Bradman 244. But the four centuries in their 674 for six told of a steel that goes right through the present dressing room. Clarke was disappointed to have fallen 17 runs short of joining them, yet he still outscored every Englishman to have batted in this Test so far. Australia are up for this in a way that may even have taken England by surprise, and no one is more quietly up for it than North. Yesterday, the jokes about compass points were wearing thin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
