Then, Sayle was a shouty stand-up in a too-tight suit, part of the same \"alternative\" generation as Ben Elton, Ade Edmondson and Rik Mayall. He was the first compere at Britain's original comedy club, the Comedy Store, and a star of cult sitcom The Young Ones . A Marxist from his childhood in working-class Liverpool, he fought the system (or at least kept on moaning about it) long after Elton and Co became part of it. And now? At the age of 49, Sayle is a hard-working writer. He no longer works as a stand-up, and even acting comes second to his books. The turning point came four years ago. Sayle's career as a TV and film actor was in gentle decline, and no one - including the man himself - had been much impressed with how the handful of TV movies he had written had turned out. It was three years since Sayle had last toured as a stand-up. He had produced two books in the 1980s - a comic detective story called Train to Hell and the cartoon book Geoffrey the Tube Train and the Fat Comedian - but they were out of print, and even he could barely remember what they were about. Then he decided to try his hand at short stories. \"Everything came together,\" he recalls. \"It felt right from the very beginning.\" Sayle's first collection, Barcelona Plates , has now sold more than 50,000 copies; Douglas Adams described the book as \"a complete revelation\". The second, The Dog Catcher , has sold 9,000 in hardback. \"I tell people I'm the best-selling short-story writer since the war,\" Sayle says. \"It might even true.\" These are nihilistic tales of greed, cannibalism, murder and joyless sex. In the title story of Barcelona Plates , a holidaying Brit causes the car crash that killed Princess Diana and \"didn't give a fuck\"; in that of The Dog Catcher , the drifter who has been turning tricks in a respectable Spanish village is murdered during the annual pest-shoot. There is humour - but usually of the sneering kind. And whenever the subject turns to the entertainment business (which is often), the mockery is merciless, even at Sayle's own expense. Barcelona Plates features the story of Nic and Tob, two undeservingly successful comedians whose arrival \"had fortunately coincided with the rise of stupidity, the public having tired of being shouted at by fat men about things that weren't their fault as a form of light entertainment\". The Dog Catcher , meanwhile, introduces a BBC commissioning editor who will not make a single decision in case it turns out to be wrong, dodging supplicants in the style of Catch-22 's Major Major. Sayle, you know, is writing from bitter experience. The cynical, sometimes ranting tone will be familiar to anyone who has seen Sayle's stand-up. Does he really have such a bleak view of life? \"You know,\" he says, \"when you write it's not all of you. It's just what you find works for you. I went through a cuddly phase in the mid-1990s, when I wrote the romantic comedy Sorry About Last Night [in which Sayle starred opposite Siobhan Redmond]. I was looking at it the other day and I thought: 'It's too nice.' What works best for me is me being black, black, black. It's not all that I am as a person, although I do have a jaundiced view of humanity.\" Is it cathartic? \"I don't know. I am pretty cheerful.\" We shouldn't read too much into his sniping at his fellow comedians, he insists. \"One of the things I liked as a comic was random nastiness. It always seemed a bit pointless to me to do stuff about people who are truly evil. It seemed more artistic to attack people who are relatively harmless.\" Bob Mortimer, he says, \"really likes\" him. It's a remark he has made on several occasions, never mentioning if the feeling is reciprocated. The first short stories Sayle remembers reading were by H G Wells. Little Alexei's parents were dyed-in-the-wool communists, and \"Wells was allowed in our house because he was considered progressive. We hated Orwell because he was anti-Stalin. And then I moved on. I went through a science-fiction phase: Asimov, Bradbury, people like that. And then Graham Greene, Kingsley Amis.\" Now he reads \"whatever my wife's reading group is doing that month. I read it first and she never gets round to reading it.\" He recently finished Conrad's Heart of Darkness and is currently trying his best to get through Dickens's Great Expectations . It's a safe bet that he doesn't read much by his fellow comedians. \"I was the first alternative comic to write a novel,\" he says with a sigh. \"Fucking hell, it's a terrible legacy . . .\" Sayle's Bloomsbury home is in the street where Dickens once lived, and he has no qualms about identifying himself with his hero: \"He was also somebody who'd had a life before being a writer,\" he says before attacking all those writers who can only write about writing. Sayle's own life sounds attractive enough. He has been happily married for 28 years. He no longer does the auditions he so hated as an actor, and he has accepted that he may never write the Great Screenplay. \"The scripts that did make it to telly all read great, but none of them really came off the page. It's just a wonderful experience for me to be completely in control now, to do everything - to paint the scenery, do the sound, do the music, play all the parts, make the entire 'movie' myself.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
