But push the American teenager to draw a link between the two events and she is far too modest to acknowledge her contribution. Yet what has occurred in women's golf since 2005 is a revolution no less dramatic than that witnessed in women's tennis in the 10 years before. What Creamer, fellow teenager Michelle Wie and 22-year-old Natalie Gulbis have achieved in less than two years can be put on a par with the contribution of the Williams sisters, Maria Sharapova and her fellow Russians to tennis: they have delivered sporting excellence and at the same time appeal to modern celebrity culture. Until their emergence, female golf stars had been condemned to suffer the same condescension as the tennis players of the Eighties - when good-looking competitors were there to be patronised and ogled, and the rest open to saloon-bar innuendo about their sexuality. Britain's Laura Davies, Sweden's Annika Sorenstam and Australia's Karrie Webb, all of whom brought a commitment to training and a competitive instinct to playing previously unseen, may have won credibility for golf as a serious sport in the past decade but they could never provide the glamour to elevate it to the status that women's tennis was beginning to enjoy. That can be a mixed blessing, of course. Monica Seles, Jennifer Capriati and Martina Hingis, for example, all brought vim, personality and colour to their sport before the arrival of the Williams sisters and Sharapova, but the poster girl for women's tennis was Anna Kournikova, a player who in more than 130 attempts never won a singles event on the main tour. No one watching last year's Solheim Cup would have mistaken any of the Europe or America players for a Kournikova-style glamourpuss. The biennial contest between the two teams had until then lived in the shadow of its male equivalent, the Ryder Cup. Now, as the heat of battle intensified, the American TV ratings were up 60 per cent on the previous match, exceeding even the increase of one third that LPGA Tour events were enjoying. And it was the American Creamer who caught the eye throughout. Known as the Pink Panther because of her love of pink outfits (even her golf bag is that colour) and with her gleaming smile, ponytail ribbons and the Stars and Stripes daubed on her cheeks, Creamer showed no inhibitions. Though only a rookie, she boldly declared on the eve of the competition: 'The Europeans had better get ready because they are going to get beat.' Looking back at her comments now, as she prepares for a fortnight competing in Europe, she recalls: 'My dad said, \"That's a big statement\", but I didn't think so. I was so excited, the whole team was standing behind me and [team captain] Nancy Lopez asked me to speak. It was hard to think we weren't going to win.' While the rest of her team struggled during the first two days of the match, Creamer lost only one of the four matches she played. On the final day, with the scores tied at 8-8, she was drawn against Laura Davies, 22 years her senior. Less than three hours after teeing off, the pair were shaking hands. A game that was supposed to be played over 18 holes was made redundant after only 13 as Creamer raced to a 7&amp;5 victory, giving her side the first point of the day and setting the momentum swinging behind her more experienced compatriots, who eventually triumphed 15\u00bd to 12\u00bd. Posting seven birdies in 13 holes, Creamer had delivered one of the most dominant displays ever seen in the competition. She just wishes their match had lasted longer: 'I played really good golf and I would have loved to have finished the 18 holes, that's for sure, but you can only play until the match is decided.' She adds, with a display of pity for her opponent that could almost be construed as condescension: 'Laura put up a really good fight but it was just that I was really on top of my game.' Creamer's achievements were quickly overshadowed by the news a month later that the Hawaiian prodigy Wie was turning professional. It was not simply Wie's age - she was still a few days short of her 16th birthday - that attracted the world's press. Nike and Sony had signed sponsorship deals worth $10m (\u00a35.4m). These were not jewellery or cosmetics endorsements in the manner of Kournikova's key deals. Wie's performances in the professional tournaments in which she had competed as an amateur - six top-20 finishes in seven starts in 2004, including fourth in a major, the Kraft Nabisco Championship - justified their faith. In the same year, she failed by a shot to make the cut at the men's Sony Open, though she outscored the reigning Open and US Open champions. The question of who has the most talent, Creamer or Wie, is one that can sustain the burgeoning interest in the women's game for at least a decade. Creamer is herself ambivalent on this issue. Three years ago, while still an amateur, she told reporters: 'It gets old. You look everywhere and there [Wie] is. I play against the best juniors in the world and she's just another junior. I don't place her on a higher plateau.' Today, however, she is more diplomatic: 'Michelle is an awesome player and she has been a professional golfer for a long time already in my mind. I think that if she commits to women's golf then there will be even more interest in our sport because the media like her. That means bigger purses, so ultimately it will be to my advantage, too.' What can be affirmed for now is that no woman golfer in the modern era has matched Creamer's achievements so young. Wie can hit the ball further and has now made the cut in a men's tournament, albeit on the Asian tour, but while she busily flits from one tour to another she has not yet got on with the business of winning. Creamer, by contrast, has four tour victories to her name, despite only turning professional, aged 18, in November 2004. 'In the press conference before Paula's first tournament she said that she wanted to win a tournament, she wanted to play in the Solheim Cup and she wanted to be Rookie of the Year,' recalls David Whelan, Creamer's Geordie coach, a former European Tour golfer. 'They were all lofty goals and most of the hardened LPGA players would have been sitting there thinking, \"Yeah, right\", but I said to her dad that if she got a run of 10 tournaments she would win one of them in her first year.' Whelan was right and so was Creamer. In May 2005, in her ninth professional tournament Creamer holed a 17ft birdie putt at the last hole to win the Sybase Classic by one shot and become, aged 18 years and nine months, the youngest winner of a 72-hole LPGA tournament. By the end of the year, Creamer had become the first LPGA Tour rookie and the youngest golfer to play in the Solheim, as well as the youngest and fastest golfer to reach $1m in prize money, finishing second behind Annika Sorenstam on the money list. That Rookie of the Year award was a mere formality. 'Second on the money list as a rookie was a big achievement,' says the golfer who is still the one to beat, Annika Sorenstam. 'It was not as if Paula came on to a tour where the golfers had no idea of how to compete. Paula is leading a new generation that seems to be a lot stronger at a young age. These girls are very competitive, they hit the ball a long way and they are mentally ready for the tour. They are well travelled so when they come on tour it's not such a huge change for them - it's not as if they have to wait five years to be competitive.' 'I want to be number one in the world this year,' Creamer declares without batting an eyelid, but that may be a distant goal for now. Since 1995, when she won her first major, Sorenstam has established a supremacy over her fellow professionals that surpasses Tiger Woods's dominance of the men's game. Like that of Woods, far from numbing interest, Sorenstam's monopoly of golf's top honours has captured the wider public imagination. Despite the fact she is 35, she told OSM in April that she believes she can still improve and achieve an unprecedented grand slam - winning all four majors in one season: 'If there was anything that would give my achievements greater definition then it would be [that].' Creamer readily acknowledges the scale of the challenge: 'As far as my rivals go, all I know for sure is Annika right now. We all know how great she is and she is in her prime, and beyond her it is difficult to pick out individual players because one of the great things about women's golf is that it is becoming very international and we can have all the best players from all over the world playing in the same tournament. That is very exciting.' Creamer is not wrong about the game becoming more international. If America is the hunting ground for the top female professionals, then the breeding ground appears to be in the East. In 1997, there were no South Korean players on the LPGA tour. Today, led by the veteran Se Ri Pak, who has four majors to her name, there are 32 and six of those have picked up 13 tournament victories between them this season. Despite this intense competition, 'Paula can become world number one,' says Whelan. 'But I don't think anyone is going to be a Tiger Woods and stay number one for years, and it certainly won't be Michelle Wie. I think you will have five or six girls up there - Paula being one of them - who will trade punches for that position over the next five years. I think Annika will be competitive for only another three or four years, and Michelle has a lot to learn from a winning standpoint - you can't just compete sporadically and be the best in the world. It is almost as if Michelle wants to win the Masters before she has won a junior tournament. There is a natural progression in golf.' In part, Creamer's success at such a young age is down to her education. She spent the past five years of high school at the elite IMG Academies in Bradenton, Florida, which have earned a reputation for fast-tracking promising athletes into hardened, professional competitors. Home to the David Leadbetter Golf Academy (named after Nick Faldo's former coach), the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy and specialist facilities for all the major sports, with its own high school on site and golf club across the road, IMG Academies provide a combination of private academic studies and world-class sports training. It comes at a price, however. Ambitious parents have to be able to afford the annual $50,000 fees. The Creamer family - Paula, father Paul and mother Karen - moved from the West Coast and bought a villa on the academy's estate, with airline captain Paul transferring to American Airlines' base in Miami. It was a huge sacrifice for the family considering their 14-year-old daughter had only been playing golf competitively for two years. Creamer had started swinging clubs aged 10, when she would accompany Paul to the driving range at Castlewood Country Club in Pleasanton, California, where the family lived behind the first green. At the time her heart was in acrobatic dancing, but by the time she was 12 she was torn between becoming a cheerleader with her friends or joining the school golf team: 'My dad said, \"Do you want to cheer for someone or do you want them to cheer for you?\", and that night I decided I wanted them to cheer for me.' Having fast established herself as the star golfer on the school team, Creamer visited IMG Academies on a training camp. 'We visited the Leadbetter academy before I joined,' she recalls. 'Growing up in California the competition was not as good and here was this unbelievable place in Florida. Having spent two days there I was so depressed when we had to leave - that was where I wanted to be. After a couple of months my parents asked me if I wanted to go back. All we took was two suitcases each and my clubs and we have been there ever since!' The reel of sporting superstars to have honed their bodies, techniques and brains at IMG Academies is dazzling: Andre Agassi, Jim Courier, the Williams sisters and Maria Sharapova in tennis, and US tour golfers Sean O'Hair, Ty Tryon and Casey Wittenburg. Wie - perhaps the ultimate example of an adult golf swing uncoiling from a child's body - was also a regular visitor as an amateur. 'The Leadbetter Academy was a match made in heaven for me,' says Creamer, who was granted a scholarship after her first year. 'I wanted to be around athletes who were driving themselves to be the best, at a place where you can really thrive and improve yourself. They work on so many different sports there that you get to meet so many different people and learn different things from them.' 'She didn't have all that good a swing to start off with, but she was a great competitor,' recalls Whelan, who remains director of the golf academy at Bradenton. 'When I met Paula she was 14 and had won a lot of tournaments, so we planned all through the last few years what she needed to do and she became one of our star pupils.' Nine days after picking up her first winner's cheque, for $187,500, at the Sybase Classic, Creamer was at Pendleton High School, swapping her pink TaylorMade cap for a graduation mortarboard. 'It was so exciting to go back to graduate, particularly as I had just won,' says Creamer. 'A lot of friends and family were there, and a lot of the people who had helped me get to where I am. I guess I had a little bit of star status which was nice, but at the end of the day all the students at Pendleton are athletes, and they are all exceptionally good at their sport, so there are a lot of champions-in-waiting there.' Like Solheim Cup team-mate Natalie Gulbis, Creamer's tall and photogenic physique means that her appeal extends not just to the marketeers of America but also to its male sports fans. A regular in the pages of men's magazine FHM, Gulbis has her own TV series, The Natalie Gulbis Show, in which viewers can enjoy her, in various states of undress, posing for calendar photo shoots. Creamer has, so far, declined to appear in anything as racy. But she has featured in fashion shoots for sponsors such as Adidas and received marriage proposals from random male admirers leaning over the ropes at tournaments ('I just laugh at them'). Yet, in many ways, her life remains like that of millions of other 19-year-olds: she still lives with her parents, her dad has not yet allowed her to buy her own car and she has never used a cash machine - 'If I need some cash I just go to my dad,' admits the golfing millionaire. Creamer still gets told to clean up her room, which is decorated in her favourite colour, pink ('It's just so girlie'). She has only ever had one boyfriend, another promising golfer, Tarik Can. The couple met at IMG Academies, started dating at 16 (once Creamer was allowed to do so by her dad) and are still together. While Can is perfecting his own game at Augusta State University, Creamer travels the world. She comes to England at the end of the month to compete in the British Open at Royal Lytham, where she will be hoping to enjoy more luxurious surroundings than she did during her debut in golf's third major of the calendar last year. Having arrived in the north west on a high from her triumph at the Evian Masters a week before, Creamer found herself booked into humble bed-and-breakfast lodgings in Southport near Royal Birkdale and unable to upgrade. For a golfer accustomed to spacious American hotels, a house in which golf shoes were forbidden beyond the porch and golf bags could barely fit up the stairs was something of a culture shock. 'It was a little different to what the hotels are like at home. The B&amp;B was interesting and fun, but small,' she says, sounding like an American backpacker amused by her experiences travelling around Europe, though without any enthusiasm to repeat them. 'I did not have a hair dryer, which was a very unusual situation for me, but I did try a full English breakfast, once.' Creamer - and her parents - will be staying in a rented house at Lytham for the Open later this month. Let's hope this teenager remembers to keep her room tidy because it would be a great shame if her dad did not allow her to come out to play. Now meet the Lendl daughters... Sporting dads can be intense individuals driving their children on, but imagine your father was a man who had spent 270 weeks as the world's highest ranked tennis player, winning $20m in prize money and eight grand-slam singles titles. Hanging out at the local mall was probably never an option for the daughters of Ivan Lendl. Yet instead of grooming his children for the hard courts of Europe, the Czechoslovakia-born star is preparing them for the fairways of America. Since retiring from tennis in 1994 and establishing a home in his adopted country in Connecticut, Lendl's obsession has been golf. An excellent player himself, he made one pro tour appearance, albeit a failed one, at the 1996 Czech Open, and is a regular on the celebrity circuit. But the burning desire that characterised his tennis was never extinguished; instead it has been transferred to his daughters' careers. 'We talk about golf all the time ,' 14-year-old Isabelle has said. And the girls clearly have the talent, too. Currently placed at 11 in the American Junior Golf Association's rankings, Isabelle is 12 places better off than her elder sister, Marika, who is 16. Both have won significant junior competitions, with Marika in 2004 becoming the youngest ever winner of the prestigious Scott Robertson tournament, a title Isabelle won this year. Along with 11-year-old Daniela, they are all enrolled at the David Leadbetter Golf Academy in Bradenton, Florida, from which Paula Creamer graduated, and may be joined by Ivan's youngest, Nikola, who at eight is only just beginning to play. Only Isabelle's twin, Caroline, is not interested. 'I love the strategy of golf. And I love to win,' Marika said last year, showing she had inherited her father's competitive nature. A Lendl could be chasing grand slams again soon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
