This has been corrected. 'I gave up. Then the words drifted out of my head' Beryl Bainbridge The day is almost upon us, that fateful day when the smoking of cigarettes in public places will be banned. The puffing of tobacco is now deemed more destructive than the use of the motor car, an invention which, apparently contributing to global warming, is thought to be capable of wiping out the planet. The drug nicotine, on the other hand, just kills those who light up. One can see, sort of, that smoking in restaurants might cause a few health-conscious customers to wave their forks in distress, but strange that drinking is not thought to be that dangerous. One wonders who decided that lungs were more vulnerable than livers. I grew up during the war, when tobacco was rationed. My dad smoked a pipe, and when he'd used up his coupons he resorted to stuffing its bowl with Kardomah tea leaves. It smelt nice and he was nice too until he ran out of supplies. My mother smoked two Craven As, one on Christmas morning and another at 10 past midnight on New Year's Eve. Once only, she lit up after the Christmas pudding, but that was because her brother, staggering down the path, left after a flaming row to do with investments. I didn't know what investments meant, but clearly remember my father shouting triumphantly that my uncle had a mind as bald as his head. By a strange coincidence I have lived for the past 40 years in a house whose back windows give a clear view of what was once the Carreras Craven A factory; it's the one with the giant black cats above the entrance. My Auntie Margo smoked. She worked in a munitions factory and suffered from bronchitis. Visiting her once, when she was in a bad way, coughing and wheezing, her doctor told me to run down to the shops to get her some Woodbines to loosen the phlegm. I knew about that particular brand because my father had told me about a vicar in the trenches of the first world war who was nicknamed Woodbine Willie on account of his supplying the dying with a last inhalation. Though, aged 16, I was regularly required to fetch cigarettes for the actors at the Liverpool Playhouse, I didn't inhale one myself until three years later, on stage at the Dundee repertory theatre. I can't remember the name of the play, but I took three puffs a night as a worried girl about to appear in court. I didn't take in the smoke except once and then everything went spinning, as though I was on a roundabout. Years later, I often wondered who had enjoyed my unfinished fags and ended up a consumptive. I didn't have the money to become a regular smoker until the 1980s, and it was at the beginning of that decade that I presented a series of television documentaries to do with a famous journey across England taken by JB Priestley 50 years before. One of the places we visited was the Wills cigarette factory in Bristol. Mr Wills came to the city in 1786 and went into partnership with a Mr Watkins, who had a warehouse in Castle Street. Caskets of Virginia tobacco were hauled up from the quayside into the workshop and eight men stripped the leaves from the plants - how odd that cigarettes should start as flowers - and prepared the tobacco for sale. The factory was now in a very modern setting, trees and the like, and it had newsstands and canteens. I was shown round by two very helpful employees. These puritanical days, when people are hellbent on telling others what's best for them, it couldn't have been easy for them showing off their workplace. Not with pride. After all, there aren't any guided tours round germ-warfare establishments or rat-poison laboratories, though I expect it helps that the government makes so much money out of what it produced. The machines were smaller than I had expected. One was filled with leaves and looked like a honeycomb cut in half, the paper cells buzzing and quivering, waiting to be fed, and the other was going in for a spot of lace-making, spinning the ciggies round and round and rearranging them in snow-white triangles waiting to be packeted. One of the workers said she was going soon, and was glad of it. She much preferred the old factory. Her father had worked for the company and his father before that, in the days when a rotten tooth was extracted by tying a piece of string to a doorknob. The firm had brought in a qualified dentist, free of charge, and medical experts. When the trams stopped outside the gates of the factory, the conductor would shout, \"Everyone out for the convalescent home.\" There was a ritual to my smoking when I sat down at my desk, one that involved the wearing of a pair of white gloves. This was to stop the inside of my fingers turning brown. I placed a packet of cigarettes directly in front of me, and a tin hat that had belonged to my father at my right elbow. The latter had nothing to do with the ceiling falling down; it was simply to cope with ash and stubs. Then, three years ago, my left big toe froze up and my calf hurt. On a warning that I might have to have a leg off, I gave up smoking. Since 1973 I had been used to writing a novel a year, as well as columns and articles. Suddenly, all the words drifted out of my head. My explanation for this is as follows. When young, the creative urge stems from a desire, a need to explain the meaning of one's own particular existence. God knows why: possibly it has something to do with the events in childhood. Then, as the years pass and life gets the boot in, the brain no longer works in the same way. What was once intuitive becomes muddied by experience, by the effects of age. It isn't that one doesn't feel the same way, simply that the optimism, the life force has begun to rust. Nicotine contains something that invigorates the mind, returns it after a puff or two to its original state. I can well see that the young shouldn't smoke, just in case. But maybe those over 70 should be allowed to continue. What about a room in pubs and restaurants set aside for those of mature years? I took up smoking again some months ago, though I've cut down in numbers. I'm not proud of my lack of willpower but feel it's important to live one's declining years in comfort. Last week I went to dinner at the Garrick Club. At nine o'clock one was allowed to light up in the dining room, at which my host, Brian Masters, thankfully got out the fags. Soon, he told me, smoking will be banned, yet the club belongs to the members; it's their house. The ban is to protect the health of the staff, who may or may not be smokers. If the club members defy the rules and light up, it's the staff who will be prosecuted. In spite of the number of lawyers and members of the civil service present, nobody could tell me whether smoking is to be forbidden in the House of Commons. If it does extend to the house, God help us. Think how Churchill might have failed us if they'd taken away his cigars. 'I want smoke that smells and feels and grabs' Germaine Greer Smoking has been important in my life, and the life of my family. Not that I was attracted to smoking as a kid; my parents had too often made me deathly sick by smoking in the car. I never smoked behind the bike sheds, never besought older children to buy fags for me. My first cigarette was given to me by my mother. I was 15, and constipated. My gut had been griping all day to no avail. \"Here,\" said mother. \"Smoke this. That'll get you going.\" And so it did. The cigarette tasted awful and scorched my throat. I might as well have been sucking on a cinder. My eyes watered and I felt dizzy. I didn't mind if I never smoked again, but I did, of course. A cigarette is still the best laxative I know. Medical researchers in the UK and the US are now testing the effectiveness of transdermal nicotine in treating inflammatory bowel disease, which is one ailment that smokers are eight times less likely to suffer than non-smokers. My mother smoked religiously all her life. She is now 90 with clear lungs, unfurred arteries, and pale, unmottled skin, marooned in a nursing home because her legs gave out on her. We used to take her big packs of cheap cigarettes called Holiday, and she would wheel herself to the designated smoking area and chain-smoke, lighting one cigarette off the other with such eagerness that she sometimes had two going at once. She hates the cold, but she would sit uncomplaining in the draughty outdoors while the chill winds off the Southern Ocean whipped at her old legs and froze her shoulders rigid, as long as she could warm herself at the red glow of her fag. Nowadays the cigarettes lie forgotten in the little drawer of her trolley. Her loss of interest in smoking is another stage in her gradual loss of interest in life. Her indestructible heart goes on relentlessly, purposelessly ticking, with no prospect of giving out no matter how devoutly she would wish it. Perhaps she should have smoked more. My sister writes to tell me that mother's depressed. A nicotine patch just might cheer her up. My mother's generation smoked like chimneys, through their pregnancies and out the other side. We were all shocked when one of my mother's girlfriends brought forth a baby kippered in utero, with yellow eye-whites and tanned skin, but the connection was not made. Cigarettes were part of the good life. Besides, my mother's babies were all brutally fit. In family photographs she can be seen big-toothily smiling like a film star, with a cork-tip elegantly propped between lacquered fingernails. Think Humphrey Bogart lighting Lauren Bacall's cigarette in The Big Sleep. My mother looked a bit like Greta Garbo, and Garbo was a dedicated smoker. Cigarettes may have had something to do with Garbo's double mastectomy for breast cancer but she was 79 already, and it wasn't the cancer that carried her off six years later. If it hadn't been for cigarettes my mother would not now be receiving the very special treatment that the Australian state and federal governments mete out to war widows. Among the ailments that ended my father's life 22 years ago was emphysema, caused by an addiction to smoking, which was held to be at least partially a consequence of the fact that all the Australian men who joined up for overseas service in 1940 were given 500 cigarettes. Daddy was seconded to the RAF so he smoked like Biggles, tapping the cigarette on the back of his hand, part of his whole urbane, unflappable performance. He wore no jewellery and scorned aftershave. His moustache was stained amber with nicotine. He had a pumice stone to clean the nicotine off his fingers. My sister does not smoke before sunset. Then she grabs a freezing Cascade Light from the fridge, twists off the cap, drops the bottle into her insulated stubby-holder, breaks out the fags, necks the stubby, lights a fag, inhales, give a broad smile and says, \"Delicious.\" She is never tempted to light up during the day and she never, ever smokes in the car, whereas I do. Disgusting I know, but driving is one time when my mind turns to nicotine. It's illegal to smoke in rented cars in Australia and the cigarette lighter and ashtray have usually been removed, so before a long car journey I have to prepare for imperceptible smoking. The trick I learned from professional chauffeurs is to crack the driver's window an inch; this creates a strong lateral current that drags the smoke straight out of the car. The cigarette is ashed by being held to the edge of the pane, leaving no tell-tale debris in the ash tray. This is always a bit of a drama for me because I'm left-handed and my right hand can't be trusted to hold the cigarette steady. Getting rid of a live butt, especially in Australia where you wouldn't dream of throwing it out the window, involves finding a tin can and putting an inch of water in the bottom. In the interests of safety every car should have such a tin, because you don't have to take your eyes off the road while you try to kill the butt by squashing it. You just drop it in the tin. Smoking in cars should be illegal, especially for someone as clumsy as me, but I reckon it gives my heart a much-needed kick just when it needs it, when the monotony or the frustration or the pollution are reaching toxic levels, fighting poison with poison. One of these days I'll probably set the upholstery or my trousers on fire. Nevertheless I have never been a really committed smoker. If there are no cigarettes in the house, I won't go out to get them. A single pack can last as long as a week. But, if I'm going to smoke, I want to know that I'm smoking. I want smoke that smells and feels and grabs like smoke. I smoke filters only because, if I smoke untipped cigarettes, my lips stick to the paper and get torn and bloody. What I smoke by choice are Camel Filters - impossible to get at British service stations. I guess I began to smoke regularly at university, because everybody else was smoking. Even my English tutor sucked on a cigarette the entire time she had eight or nine of us imprisoned in her tiny room; she would spell out the spatial relationships in a poem such as Gerard Manley Hopkins's Wreck of the Deutschland with her fag pack and her box of matches, voicing the lines round the cigarette that hung from her nether lip. Dragging on my own fag was the only way to avoid the nausea reflex that other people's smoke can still trigger. If others in a group are smoking, I'll smoke; if not not. For years I smoked only OP's - other people's. I can work for eight or nine hours in a library without feeling any kind of craving for a cigarette, but I'll probably light up on the way home, if there's a cigarette in the car. If there's not, I won't make a special stop to get some. In the 1950s my fellow students were smoking cork-tipped Virginia cigarettes, Craven A, Ardath, De Reszke (pronounced Dee Rezeek), and Du Maurier, which always struck me as dry and tasteless. Tough guys smoked untipped cigarettes, Senior Service and Pall Mall. The more adventurous - or pretentious - smoked exotic cigarettes, Black Sobranie or Passing Clouds. My mates and I followed the example of Picasso, Sartre, Camus and Orwell; we smoked Gauloises \"brunes\". And I still would, if I could ever find them. The last French factory making them shut down nearly two years ago. Altadis, the company that manufactures Gauloises, is being stalked by Imperial Tobacco. The younger generation does not like dark tobacco, so we old reprobates must do without. \"Libert\u00e9 toujours!\" has given way to \"British American Tobacco rules OK\". As the rich are growing out of the tobacco habit, the poor are being sucked into it. Our children smoke in the same spirit that they disfigure themselves with piercing and tattoos. The pleasure principle has nothing to do with it. 'At school, a bad crowd fell in with me' Johnny Cigarettes As a well brought-up, middle-class child, I should have had the moral fibre to sail through my school days without falling in with a bad crowd. Unfortunately, a bad crowd fell in with me. My school was a boys-only comprehensive in Yorkshire and the lads who ruled the roost were invariably to be found smoking behind the canteen. I wasn't among them; in fact I was perilously close to being labelled a \"greaser\", the term for the less robust kids, based on a perceived tendency to \"grease\" (inform) on the more mischievous lads. One break time I made the error of venturing past the smokers. I was summoned by a lad we'll call Stevo. \"Hey Sharpy, yer fookin' girl. You ever snogged a lass?\" \"Yeah.\" (A transparent lie). \"Dream on!\" he snorted. \"Sharpy, are you a virgin?\" asked a lad called Manny. I didn't know what a virgin was. \"Yeah,\" I replied. \"Aagh ha haargh, Sharpy's a virgin!\" \"No! I thought you said ...\" \"You ever smirked, Sharpy?\" They meant \"smoked\", but with a Humberside accent it sounds like \"smirked\". Now, here was a chance to regain some lost pride. At scout camp the previous summer, me and a couple of lads had amused ourselves by lighting pieces of straw and puffing on them. \"Yeah,\" I shrugged. \"I smirked fags before.\" \"Fookin' liar.\" I was handed the smouldering end of a B&amp;H. I held the bitter-tasting fumes in my cheeks for a few seconds. Then I puffed the smoke out. I couldn't believe it - I'd smoked my first cigarette and not even coughed \"You're still a fookin' girl,\" said the owner of the cigarette. I laughed. They laughed. We were, quite literally, having a laugh! At dinner times, many pupils would spend their dinner money on goodies at the nearby corner shop. On one foray I bumped into my fag-toting foes again. \"You not smirkin', Sharpy?\" said Stevo. \"Erm ... I'm skint.\" \"Give you one for nowt if you go get us a pack,\" said Manny. I ended up buying cigarettes for the lads on several occasions; once I think I bought 40 in one go. I was practically a drug trafficker. Before long a friend of the smokers started calling me \"Johnny Cigarette-boy\". Soon the others adopted the name. They hardly meant it as a tribute, but I thought it had a certain gangster cachet. Still, my criminal career was short-lived: one day I was queuing in front of a particularly gobby classmate. As I was handed 20 B&amp;H, he piped up: \"You're not 16!\" The game was up. I didn't want to tell the hard kids that I'd been informed on, or they'd probably collar the offender. So I hatched a plan.\"I've given up,\" I said, refusing to take my usual reward. \"I got addicted.\" A tense confrontation ensued, in which my tormentor threatened to \"bray\" me, as was customary. But then he didn't. Nothing happened. I walked away, my pride restored. A few years later, in sixth form, I told a new friend of my old nickname, and soon it was revived. And just to prove the point, I started smoking again. I even learned to inhale. The nickname was adopted by friends at university. Then I started writing a music fanzine, and, being a smart-arse student, I thought the name Johnny Cigarettes was so crap, it was brilliant. I sent my fanzine to NME, started writing reviews for it, and my byline soon became a regular fixture on its pages, although I was warned, early on, that I would never get taken seriously using that name. \"There's nothing cool about smoking,\" said one reader in the NME's letters page. If only that were true, I might have avoided all this nonsense and gone and got a proper job. \u00b7 Johnny Cigarettes now uses his real name, Johnny Sharp. He is a freelance writer and gave up smoking in 1998."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
