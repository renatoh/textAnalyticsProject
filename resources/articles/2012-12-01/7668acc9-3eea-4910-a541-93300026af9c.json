More than 10,000 union members surged on the state capitol in Lansing to voice their concern over a pair of bills they argue could lead to lower wages, poorer representation for workers and a generally bad deal for labour unions. The protests began peacefully, if loudly, but the strength of feeling over the controversial right-to-work law became apparent with complaints variously of a \"union mob\" assault, an undemocratic pepper-spraying and an unorthodox removal of a tent. Hundreds of union members had travelled to Detroit in anticipation of Tuesday's protest for a crash course in civil disobedience, with union sources briefing in advance that the resulting action would form the highlight of the day. Once news came through that the final two bills had been sent to governor Rick Snyder - who signed them into law shortly afterwards - the newly trained union members sprang into action. Around 20 people gathered outside the George W Romney building opposite the state capitol where Snyder keeps an office. The group sat cross-legged in front of the entrance, as crowds of protesters surged around them, chanting the now familiar refrain from the Occupy movement: \"This is what democracy looks like.\" By midday there were about 2,000 people gathered around the George W Romney building, having largely decamped from their earlier vantage point directly outside the capitol. Police officers put on riot gear and withdrew long sticks from their belts, forming lines in an effort to divide the crowd and isolate the civil disobedients at the front of the building. As those present lamented the police intervention with cries of \"Shame on you, you're union too,\" the growing numbers in the crowd prompted a gingerly intervention from four police officers on horseback, one particularly skittish stallion leaving a sizable protest of its own on the pavement in front of the building. Earlier, there had been clashes closer to the capitol, when union protesters took umbrage with the admittedly odd decision of Tea Party group Americans for Prosperity to pitch a huge tent on the lawn where they knew thousands of rowdy demonstrators would be gathered. That tent, and a similarly cavernous one pitched by fellow pro-right to work group Involve America had looked ridiculous early in the morning, with four or five people pottering around uncomfortably inside as anti right-to-workers gathered on the grass around them. By 11am, they began to look perilous, however, and by midday both tents were on the ground, covered in mud. Fox News contributor Steven Crowder had been present at the Americans for Prosperity tent as it went down, and claimed to have been assaulted by a union 'mob' as the canvas was torn to the earth. Video footage posted by Crowder of the assault \u2013 footage he had promised \"will be the most shocking thing you see all day\" \u2013 showed one man throwing several punches at Crowder. He later posted a photo showing a chipped tooth which he said had been sustained during the scuffle. Various sources on the ground reported that the tents had been taken down by protesters. Not long before, two union members circled the Involve America tent, loosening its guide ropes. As the white tents lay trampled on the increasingly muddy ground some protesters, posed triumphantly for pictures in the rubble. Union protesters had their own causes for complaint, however, with the Michigan branch of the AFL-CIO posting a video to YouTube which they claimed showed police pepper-spraying union members close to the capitol. Michigan state police could not immediately be reached for comment. By 4pm there was a steady stream of protesters away from the capitol, and the lawn in front of the building looked a barren mess. One of the few reminders of the raucousness of the morning were a group of 9ft tall inflatable rats, one of which had been labelled 'Governor Snyder'. A small team of protesters had hoisted the Snyder rat aloft, the rodent's head bobbing and weaving as it made its way through the masses, enjoying a reception the real governor would never receive from this crowd. The rat eventually wobbled its way up to the top of the steps where it remained after the crowd had begun to dwindle, a slightly sad reminder of how jubilant the demonstration had been in the morning \u2013 before the the law was signed, the cold began to bite, and decisions began to be made to head for home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
