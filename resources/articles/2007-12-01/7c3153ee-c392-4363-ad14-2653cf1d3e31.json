Sky, with 12 games to choose from, plucked a turkey. It was stuffed with fear and fruitless hoofing from the only two teams in the division whose games average fewer than two goals. First-half watchers would surely have switched off before the better second. Wolves were like an energy-efficient light bulb, imperceptible at first. They were still dim at the interval, reached by Leicester untroubled and ahead. Iain Hume, having changed his boots after two minutes, scored after four with a free-kick. Darron Gibson, on loan from Manchester United, ducked out of the wall. Mick McCarthy brought on Freddy Eastwood for Stephen Elliott. After 53 minutes home fans chanted: \"We've had a shot on goal.\" After 73 ribaldry turned to glee as another some-time striker and even newer substitute, Andy Keogh, sped on to Jay Bothroyd's pass and crossed for Matt Jarvis to score his first goal for Wolves. Justice was simply done. The balance of brightness had swung and Collins John, twice clear on Wayne Hennessey, had twice been denied by the 20-year-old. Leicester's Ian Holloway, slumping into the bottom three, accepted the point. \"I know what we need - some wide men who can cross it and forwards who can score. It's so simple it's a joke. I hope we have a decent transfer window.\" He is currently putting out a side dressed from the wardrobes of five previous managers this year. It is hard to cut a dash. He aims to reduce a squad of 41 by nine; 15 may go. \"I've got dead men walking here,\" he said, \"and I'm not putting up with what happened at Leeds and Nottingham Forest.\" Bruno N'Gotty was one of six named but the 36-year-old, given a chance in front of the back four, won Holloway's praise for a diligent display. He is not Claude Makelele but he may avoid the charity shop. \"I want players who care more than fans about the club. They've watched dross for four years,\" Holloway said. His enthusiasm is irrepressible, a flamb\u00e9 that makes McCarthy look like suet pudding. Both fancy Steve Howard, whose goals helped Derby up last season but have dried up this. Of the strikers who came from the bench the Wolves man said: \"They should make me pick 'em.\" Wolves lie seventh. If fizz- ing spirit counts for anything, the clubs may cross mid-table beyond the window.
