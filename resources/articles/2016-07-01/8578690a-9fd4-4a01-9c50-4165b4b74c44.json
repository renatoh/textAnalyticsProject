Gary Neville was not contacted before publication. He disputes our account of his relationship with Roy Hodgson. In particular, we accept it was completely wrong to suggest their relationship had deteriorated; in fact, their relationship has been unchanged over a period of four years. Accordingly, the relationship did not undermine England\u2019s chances. We apologise for having suggested otherwise. \u201cYoung voters reduced to tears\u201d (News, last week, page 2) said that 46.5 million people voted in the EU referendum. This was incorrect: 33.5 million voted; 46.5 million was the total of registered eligible voters. The piece also said the vote was split 51.9% to 49.1%. We meant 48.1%. A panel on the Labour leadership (News, page 5, last week) outdatedly spoke of voting on a \u201cone man one vote\u201d basis. We meant \u201cone member one vote\u201d. Contrary to \u201cTop playwrights join fight to save drama in schools\u201d (News, last week, page 16), Richard M Wilson is not a former drama teacher but still very much employed.
