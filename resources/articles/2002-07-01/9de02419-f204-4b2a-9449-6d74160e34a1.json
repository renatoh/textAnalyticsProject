Even in Germany they call him \"the Gorilla\" and pelt him with bananas. Kahn is big, brash and apparently Thatcherite in his political views. He does not make it easy. But as he slouched against his goalpost yesterday while the Brazilians cavorted at the other end of Yokohama's vast bowl it was possible to feel more than a little sorrow for the Germany captain. He looked pitiful and the woodwork acted as a frame for his disappointment. Visualisation techniques are a major part of Kahn's prepara tion but this was not one of the big pictures he will have studied. \"I've got a feeling telling me we will be world champions,\" Kahn had said on Friday. Spilling the ball to Ronaldo was not part of the vision. \"My one and only mistake in seven matches\" was Kahn's assessment of that incident yesterday, given through gritted teeth. \"But,\" he added, \"that one mistake was brutally punished.\" Kahn's right hand sported a bandage and he said he had torn a ligament in his ring finger. Asked if that had contributed to his error, he stared and offered one word in reply: \"No.\" With the temperature of the interview dropping rapidly, Kahn was asked a warming question about the referee Pierluigi Collina, who had made a special walk to console him on the final whistle. Kahn reacted by recalling that Collina was also referee the night Manchester United belatedly put two past him to win the European Cup in Barcelona. Collina was again in charge when England won 5-1 in Munich last September. \"He doesn't bring us luck, does he?\" Kahn said. After that he was gone, leaving his interpreter on the stage to translate for an empty chair. Unhappy though Kahn was, he had earlier vowed that \"one mistake I'm not going to make tonight is to say there was nothing positive from this World Cup\". He pointed out that young players had come into the side and would be all the better in four years' time when Germany are the hosts. Kahn will be 37 then but he promised to be around, which is good news for Germany. And the Germans are clearly developing: they pass the ball simply and quickly and they harass opponents, as the Brazilians found yesterday. But, while Bernd Schneider has impressed with his tempo in midfield and Miroslav Klose has headed in winners, there is no doubt that Kahn has become Germany's key player. Until Ronaldo eclipsed him yesterday, it was even possible to mount a reasonable argument for him as the player of the tournament. Kahn has stood out in comparison to players with much larger reputations - and he did foil Ronaldo twice last night before the striker finally beat him. Until Ronaldo did so, pouncing on that spilled shot from Rivaldo, Kahn had not conceded a goal since Robbie Keane lashed the ball off a post in injury-time in Ibaraki 26 days ago. Germany have beaten Cameroon, Paraguay, the United States and South Korea in that time and, while the arm of Torsten Frings was pivotal in denying the Americans, it was Kahn who steered the Germans into the final. He was into his eighth hour without conceding a goal when Ronaldo came calling and, as Kahn slumped against his post, undoubtedly he felt a personal responsibility for Ronaldo's redemption. As he ripped off his gloves and hit the back of the net with them, there was no need to ask how he was feeling. His water bottle also made the net ripple. But once the gloves were off, Kahn's colleagues quickly moved in to thank him for his efforts in this tournament. Thomas Linke was first, then Michael Ballack, who was also nursing his own misery. Next came Rudi V\u00f6ller and his assistant, Michael Skibbe. By now Kahn was crouching and Collina was on his way. After that Kahn picked himself up and made his way to the centre circle where Kaka was sporting an \"I Belong to Jesus\" T-shirt. Despite having to witness a further 10 minutes of Brazilian celebrations the goalkeeper retained his composure and did not cry. There were also pats and arms outstretched from Pele and Franz Beckenbauer. Certainly Kahn knows where he stands with Beckenbauer. Back home at Bayern Munich the two are allies and Kahn was the subject of Beckenbauer's entry in the quote-of-the-tournament competition. \"Kahn apart,\" he said after the dismal 1-0 victory over the US in the quarter-final, \"you could take all of them, put them in a bag and hit them with a stick. Whoever got hit would deserve it.\" Yet the sight of Kahn unable to leave his woodwork last night showed all too clearly that he had, after all, been kicked from pillar to post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
