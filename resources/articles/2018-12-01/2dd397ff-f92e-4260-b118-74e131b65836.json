Did you ever notice that? While the UK and US have strong and decades-long traditions of Yuletide films, encompassing everything from White Christmas and It\u2019s a Wonderful Life to Elf and Scrooged and Lethal Weapon, here on the bottom half of the planet we don\u2019t much go for Christmas movies. To be sure, we\u2019ll watch the seasonal products of other cultures and even argue about them vigorously (as demonstrated by the ongoing debate over whether Die Hard counts as a Christmas movie), but the historical roster of Australian Christmas movies is thinly populated. The big players are 1947\u2019s Bush Christmas, starring Australian screen stalwart Chips Rafferty, and its 1983 remake, which saw Nicole Kidman take to the big screen for the first time. Throughout the 70s and 80s there is a scattering of animated features: Silent Night, Holy Night (1976); Yoram Gross\u2019 1981 offering Around the World with Dot, which sees his heroic little Aussie travel with a swagman who turns out to be Father Christmas; and A Christmas Carol (1982), which was the first of a long-running series of literary adaptations by Australian animation house Burbank Films. In Bushfire Moon (1987), a tiny tyke mistakes Charles \u201cBud\u201d Tingwell\u2019s curmudgeonly swagman for Father Christmas. From there, though, it\u2019s another 11 years until family comedy Crackers (1998), in which comedian Peter Rowsthorn\u2019s hapless dad of a suburban tribe had to negotiate Christmas with the extended family. After that? Nothing of note, unless you count seasonal horror movies like Red Christmas and Better Watch Out (both 2016), or even John Hillcoat\u2019s apocalyptic 2005 meat pie western, The Proposition, which sets its bloody apotheosis on Christmas Day. I\u2019d argue they don\u2019t really get into the spirit of the season but, like Die Hard, they\u2019re Christmas movies if you want them to be. Why only six films embracing Christmas cheer in more than 112 years of Australian feature film production? Meanwhile, the Americans are churning them out in industrial quantities; a quick browse of Netflix\u2019s seasonal offerings will reveal a plethora of options, up to and including The Christmas Chronicles, which sees tough guy Kurt Russell as a silver-fox Santa. Part of it is down to simple visual iconography, I think. We celebrate Christmas in Australia, for sure, but we\u2019re a desert island that experiences a seemingly endless summer, and the traditional trappings of the northern hemisphere holiday look a bit ludicrous against the bright, cloudless skies and blistering heat of an Australian December. Film is a visual medium, and Christmastime\u2019s visual cues \u2013 sleigh bells and fur trim, snowmen and reindeer and all that \u2013 are a poor fit in these parts. We don\u2019t need to roast chestnuts on an open fire \u2013 we can just leave them on a footpath and wait. Our own adaptations don\u2019t resonate in quite the same way \u2013 a seafood platter or a backyard barbie simply lacks the je ne sais quoi of glazed ham or roast turkey. Australia is also increasingly secular and multicultural. Christmas is rooted in religion but it has certainly grown beyond that. The season has become a secular celebration, and unarguably a pandenominational one \u2013 which is all well and good, but it does mean we tend to approach Christmas with somewhat less fervour. Perhaps we don\u2019t make Christmas movies because we\u2019re just not that fussed? Or perhaps the genre-defining, beloved-by-all, great Australian Christmas film is right around the corner \u2013 we just haven\u2019t made it yet. \u2022 Travis Johnson is a film critic and cultural commentator"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
