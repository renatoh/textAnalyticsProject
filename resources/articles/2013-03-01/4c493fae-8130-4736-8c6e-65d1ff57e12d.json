Unlikely without full all party support. Queen doesn't do politics.\" Murdoch's argument is surprising to the point of mischevious since the commons on Monday saw the support of all party leaders for the proposed royal charter. The changes endorsing the entrenchment of the royal charter were also accepted by peers without a vote. A total of just 11 tories opposed proposals to impose exemplary damages on papers that stayed outside the regulator and committed libels. In practice there are hundreds of royal charters many of them dating back centuries and it would be for the privy council to present this charter for the Queen's approval, and there is no obvious precedent for her rejecting one. But his remarks will be taken as a green light for Tories opposed to regulation to stir up a political controversy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
