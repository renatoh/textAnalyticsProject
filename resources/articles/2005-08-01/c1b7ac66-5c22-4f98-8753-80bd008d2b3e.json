Motorola has benefited from the launch of a black version of its slim Razr V3 phone while Nokia has seen strong sales of mid-market phones such as its 6230i and 6610, a segment of the market it was missing out on a year ago. In the second quarter of the year Nokia led the market with a 31.9% share, selling almost 60.8m phones, compared with a 29.6% share a year ago. Motorola was second with 34m phones, giving it 17.9% of the market, up from 15.7% in 2004, according to figures from the industry analyst Gartner. Samsung retained its third spot, selling 24.4m phones, and while its market share increased to 12.8% from 12.1% in the same quarter in 2004, the gap between second and third place has widened. \"We're going back to the 1990s, when Nokia and Motorola were in a league of their own and everyone else was trying to take what was left,\" according to Carolina Milanesi, Gartner's principal analyst. The gap looks likely to widen this year and sales of cheap phones to new customers in developing markets become an increasingly large proportion of the market. While both Nokia and Motorola produce cheap handsets aimed at developing countries, Samsung is firmly staying out of the low-end market, meaning its share is likely to be eroded as 2005 goes on. The Korean manufacturer LG is fourth with 6.5%, SonyEricsson is fifth on 6.2% and Siemens is the last counted manufacturer on 4.7%. Siemens has since sold its mobile business to Taiwan's BenQ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
