I am a lecturer in Queensland University of Technology\u2019s creative industries faculty. I teach into the mainstream bachelor of fine arts (creative and professional writing) degree and am also designing a new Indigenous-centred curriculum for the faculty. I am a mother of three sons whom I have primarily raised as a single parent. I identify with my mother\u2019s family and we are of the Wakka Wakka and Gooreng Gooreng nations of southern Queensland. Our mother raised my three sisters and I in our hometown of Gayndah, a small country town known mostly for its citrus fruit. Like my three sisters, I was able to read and write before going to school, and my year three teacher told Mum in words to the following effect: \u201cWhatever Sandra does when she grows up, it should involve words.\u201d My lifelong interest in publishing had a humble origin on my high school magazine committee, and continued through university as a co-editor of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander student handbook. After my first university degree and some professional work, I entered into editorial traineeships with Magabala Books in Broome, then with University of Queensland press in Brisbane. I later went on to become publications manager and director of publishing of Aboriginal Studies Press in Canberra. I enjoy reading and writing. As an academic I now have to be published in scholarly journals, but I do consider myself first and foremost an editor and a speaker. I have long contributed to public conversation about Indigenous writing and publishing, dating back to my first conference presentation at the Aboriginal Publishers Conference in 1994 in Vancouver, Canada. I have also held leadership roles in arts organisations including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board of the Australia Council and the Queensland Performing Arts Trust, and in 2012 I became a judge of the annual David Unaipon award for unpublished Indigenous writers. My PhD was an extension of all these interests and my current work as an academic allows me to build a stronger knowledge base as well as influence future generations in Indigenous literature and in editing and publishing in a broader industry sense. What do you plan to focus on during your week as host of @IndigenousX? I plan to focus largely on literature from First Nations\u2019 writers here in Australia through the hashtag #IndigXBooks. I will be tweeting opening lines from this canon and asking followers to name the author and book. In this way I will be engaging the @IndigenousX following in a deep pool of literature too often overlooked. It will be fun and light-hearted but unfortunately no prizes! The words of our Indigenous writers in Australia are often powerful meditations on black life and sometimes also pithy insight to matters universal to life and being. I hope for #IndigXBooks to reflect the spirit of the @IndigenousX account, which is in part about diversity and free expression amongst our peoples in communication with ourselves and with a broader participant-audience. I\u2019m also engaged in transnational Indigenous writing and hope to explore this a little too. I hope to help people kick off their 2015 with renewed vigour to engage with Indigenous Australia primarily through literature which is readily-available and primed for a broader readership. What issues are you most passionate about and why? I am most passionate about freedom: freedom to be ourselves as Indigenous peoples, to tell our own stories, to honour our ancestors, to build successful contemporary lives, to share our successes with each other, and to enjoy and sustain the bounty millennia of Indigenous custodianship has bequeathed on all people who now live on this continent. I see literature as an essential part of all of that. I am most passionate too about Indigenous families. Times are often tough living in a society that does not or cannot fully recognise us and our rights, and at the end of each day or week or month or year we need to be able to look ourselves in the eye and say we\u2019ve done our best \u2013 for ourselves, for each other, but most importantly for our children and our future generations. Once again, I see literature as part of all of this. Who are your role models, and why? First and foremost, my mother, whose strength and sacrifice took her from an impoverished and racist rural upbringing to raising four daughters who are now strong participators in contemporary Australia. Secondly, Mary Graham, a Kom-Bumerri philosopher from the Gold Coast whose writing has always inspired me. What are you hopes for the future? I hope our future will be better than our recent past. I hope our future will draw more on the longstanding traditions born of highly successful societies that looked after this continent for millennia. I hope our future will be inspired by reconciliation of past hurts and energised by fair and just agreements between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
