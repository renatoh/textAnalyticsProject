With Goran Ivanisevic, last year's champion, recovering from a shoulder operation, Pat Rafter, the runner-up, in semi-retirement and Pete Sampras wanting a late start, the All England Club turned to Andre Agassi to set the ball rolling on centre court, and he duly obliged with a performance worthy of the name champion. Of course he has been - way back in 1992 when the hair was flowing and the clothes were baggy. Yesterday the No3 seed was as crisp and proper as a starched and freshly ironed handkerchief and en route to a 6-0, 6-4, 6-4 victory he hurtled through the first set in 18 minutes, as if determined to cut Sampras's recuperation time down to the absolute minimum. It was not that his opponent, Israel's Harel Levy, was performing poorly, simply that Agassi's play was virtually error-free. \"It was very special for me. The court was playing beautifully and it felt just great being out there,\" Agassi said later. As always, the 32-year-old American had returned home to the west coast after the French Open, where he was beaten in the quarter-finals by Spain's Juan-Carlos Ferrero. He dusted off the clay and settled in to some hardcourt practice prior to flipping back across the Atlantic and setting foot on the green stuff. He is a law unto himself and his sureness of touch and movement are exemplary. Such is the quality of Agassi's shots that there appears no great difference in his approach, be it hardcourt, clay or grass. His concession to Wimbledon is to shorten the swing on forehand and backhand, but generally little else. Levy, ranked just inside the top 100, tugged at his hat, furrowed his brow and tried hard to forget he was on the most famous tennis court in the world. Attempting to control his nerves was one thing; controlling Agassi quite another. Agassi, despite the pleasant heat, was hat-less. Like the clouds above, the amount of hair on his head is variable, and on this occasion the shave was not quite as close as it sometimes is. If close shaves had been in Levy's mind when he stepped out, he was quickly disabused. Within an hour he was two sets down, and out in all but name. The crowd attempted to raise him. \"Come on Levy, you can do it,\" came a lone voice in part encouragement, part irony. The Israeli did his best, but even the line judges appeared against him. This was the reverse of the assistant referees leaning towards the underdogs in the World Cup. Here they were on the side of the top dog, and if Agassi could have wagged his tail he probably would. \"Every point is important to me. Especially these days,\" he smiled. Over on court three another champion of the last decade was also making a winning start. For Richard Krajicek, winner in 1996 when he knocked out Sampras in the quarter-finals, it was only his second match of the year and his first victory. Indeed, prior to last week when he lost to Switzerland's Roger Federer in Den Bosch, the Dutchman had been missing from the ATP Tour since November 2000, needing surgery on his right elbow last year. His 6-2, 7-5, 7-6 win against Argentina's Franco Squillari, no lover of grass, would normally have been expected. On this occasion it came as a tremendous relief to Krajicek. \"I didn't believe I was going to play Wimbledon this year. I was maybe even doubting whether I would ever play again.\" It was good to see him back. The No11 seed Andy Roddick walked through to a place in the second round when his Czech opponent Bohdan Ulihrach retired unexpectedly. The American teenager meets Spain's Alberto Martin in the second round. On a good opening day for the leading players, the No2 seed Marat Safin eased his way past the former finalist Cedric Pioline but afterwards revealed he is playing through the pain barrier. The 22-year-old Russian, a quarter-finalist last year ago, is still troubled by a back injury, despite recently returning to Moscow for treatment. However, he showed little sign of discomfort during his 7-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over the veteran Frenchman in a two-hour match played on a sweltering court one. Safin now faces Belgium's Olivier Rochus. His compatriot, the No5 seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov beat Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty 6-1, 7-6, 7-6. Todd Martin, seeded 26th, beat Italy's Davide Sanguinetti 6-3, 6-4, 7-6. The 31-year-old American has been beaten in two semi-finals at Wimbledon and will now meet the unseeded Frenchman Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment in the second round."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
