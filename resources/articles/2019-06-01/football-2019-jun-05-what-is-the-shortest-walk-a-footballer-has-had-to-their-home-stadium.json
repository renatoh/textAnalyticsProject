Have any top-level players been able to walk to a game because they live so close?\u201d asks Graham Clayton. They certainly have Graham, and here\u2019s George Jones to get the ball rolling. \u201cKeith Chegwin used to doorstep celebrities on the Big Breakfast TV show in the mid-1990s,\u201d he writes. \u201cHe once woke up John Scales, living in a Liverpool-owned apartment on Anfield Road \u2013 about 30 yards from Anfield itself \u2013 to have a chat about what it was like being a \u2018Spice Boy\u2019.\u201d There\u2019s also an example from the north-east of England. \u201cAlbert Park in Middlesbrough has a statue of Brian Clough depicting him walking from his house on Valley Road, through the park to Ayresome Park former home of Boro, a walk of about 15 minutes,\u201d writes Garry Brogden, who has even provided pictorial evidence. Andy Wright remembers \u201cwhen Tom Finney started playing for Preston North End, he was living where he grew up in St Michael\u2019s Road, Deepdale. That\u2019s about 200 yards from Deepdale Road, with PNE\u2019s ground a hundred further on.\u201d Steve Kirkwood winds the clock back even further. \u201cMy great-grandfather Danny Kirkwood played for the title-winning Everton team of 1890-91, having been brought down from Scotland as one of the first-ever professional players in England. History says the club moved to Goodison in the summer of 1891 after the rent was increased at Anfield. He moved temporarily to a house in Goodison Avenue which was where the Park End now stands. I think at the time it was about five yards away from the old Park End entrance.\u201d Let\u2019s head further north now, to Iceland. \u201cSome of the international players that have played for KR Reykjavik, Iceland\u2018s largest club, through the years have lived in an apartment building on the other side of the road from their home stadium,\u201d writes Sveinn Sigb\u00f8rsson. \u201cThe attached screenshot shows that the distance from that building to the actual goal on the pitch is just 55 metres.\u201d See the scientific evidence below. Chris Williams offers that \u201cone-time Paraguay international Nelson Valdez actually lived under the grandstand at his first club Atl\u00e9tico Tembetary. He was only in the youth academy at the time, he knew his family was too poor to afford accommodation so he didn\u2019t want to bother them with the fact he had nowhere to live.\u201d To the Netherlands. \u201cThe mighty Johan Cruyff grew up next to De Meer, the old stadium of Ajax in Amsterdam\u2019s Betondorp neighbourhood,\u201d mails Sander Kuvener. \u201cHis mother was a cleaning lady there. I believe he still lived in Betondorp when he made his debut for Ajax at the tender age of 17 in 1964.\u201d But it\u2019s probably hard to beat David Triggs\u2019s example for proximity with a very cosy east London pad which has the added bonus of offering a free view of every home match. \u201cWhen Steven Dawson signed for Leyton Orient from Bury he lived in the apartments built into the stands at Brisbane Road called Kitchen Court. Can\u2019t see many players living closer than that.\u201d Goals mirroring international caps \u201cIan Edwards scored four goals in four games for Wales. I know some players such as Poul Nielsen and Gerd M\u00fcller scored more than they played in but what is the highest number for having the exact same number of international goals as games?\u201d tweets @GTPLiquid. Rhys Shakeshaft has found us a perfect example in Robert Smyth McColl, who scored 13 goals in 13 games for Scotland between 1896 and 1908. We\u2019ve had a look too and our digging has unearthed two better examples of international caps mirroring international goals. Legendary Athletic Bilbao striker, Telmo Zarra, scored 20 goals in 20 games for Spain between 1945 and 1951. But stretching the 1.0 goals per game ratio to 27 in 27 games is the Costa Rica striker Juan Ulloa, who created this lovely bit of symmetry between 1955 and 1961. Substituting both goalkeepers (the Cambridge edition) Adam Clark got in touch with a quirky example on this curiosity that we touched upon last week. \u201cThe game between Cambridge United and Tranmere Rovers in April 2002 was to be the final home game of popular U\u2019s goalkeeper Lionel P\u00e9rez,\u201d writes Adam. \u201cWhen Cambridge were awarded a penalty there was a huge clamour from the crowd for P\u00e9rez to take it, and he duly got the nod from manager John Taylor. \u201cUnfortunately he hit the ball straight at Tranmere keeper Joe Murphy, who injured himself saving it and had to be substituted, resulting in the chant \u2018Lionel killed the keeper\u2019. With a couple of minutes to go, with Cambridge leading 2-1, Taylor chose to substitute P\u00e9rez so the fans could give him a standing ovation. Therefore, both goalkeepers had been substituted, albeit for very differing reasons.\u201d Knowledge archive Eugene Quinn wrote in asking if any other club managers had been called up to international teams after Vincent Kompany was named in Belgium\u2019s squad for their Euro 2020 qualifiers. A similar question was asked by Rich Liddiatt in 2010, at a time when David James was linked with the Portsmouth job \u2026 Graeme James Souness played for, and captained, Scotland in the Mexico World Cup in 1986 having been appointed player-manager at Rangers in April of the same year. In 1986 Northern Ireland also had a player-manager in their squad in the shape of reserve keeper Jim Platt. Platt had been appointed Coleraine manager in 1985, but was still part of the squad that went out in the first round in Mexico. And, perhaps most impressively, there\u2019s Gunnar Gren, along with Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm part of the great Gre-No-Li Milan trio of the early 1950s, who returned to Sweden to take over as manager of Orgryte in 1956. And he was still in the hotseat at the old Gamla Ullevi ground in 1958 when, at the age of 37, Gren was a key part of the Sweden side that made it all the way to the final before losing to Brazil. Can you help? \u201cIn the Europa League final, eight players featured who had the letter Z in their name. Has there been a game with more?\u201d asks Sam Hughes. \u201cFabio Quagliarella was Serie A\u2019s top scorer at 36. Has a major European league had an older top scorer?\u201d asks George Jones. \u201cGillingham\u2019s Elliott List has made 98 appearances, but only 38 starts. Even if he starts his next two games, he\u2019ll reach the milestone of 100 games for the club having only started 40% of said games. Have any players reached their century for a club having made a smaller number of starts?\u201d wonders Chris Matterface. \u201cFC Helsingor just got relegated to Denmark\u2019s third tier despite only conceding 43 goals in 33 games, 1.3 goals per game,\u201d writes William Jansen. \u201cWhat are the fewest goals conceded per game by a relegated team?\u201d Email your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
