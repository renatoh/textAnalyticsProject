Ferguson denies the allegation, which was made after the clubs' FA Cup fourth-round tie at Goodison Park on January 25. Fulham beat Everton 2-1 in the replay at Loftus Road last night. \"We refute the allegation completely,\" said Ferguson's legal adviser Kevin Dooley. \"There's no truth in it.\" The FA confirmed today they have received a letter of complaint from Fulham regarding the incident. Chris Coleman, the Fulham boss, had criticised Boa Morte for taking his story to the press rather than direct to the FA. The FA, in turn, are unhappy that Fulham took so long to transform the case from an internal club probe into an investigation by English football's governing body. That is now imminent after Fulham's dossier on the case landed on FA chief executive Mark Palios's desk. But despite the furore, Boa Morte - who must also respond to a separate FA demand for a \"full explanation\" of his racism claim - is coping with the media spotlight. His representative Amadeu Paixco said: \"Luis is doing okay. He doesn't want to speak to any reporters now. He's going to keep quiet until Fulham say he can talk.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
