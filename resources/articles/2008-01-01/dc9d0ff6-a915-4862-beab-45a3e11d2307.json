Our mood of paranoid uncertainty is improved by ready access to the familiar - and the cheerful. BMW's reissue of the Mini in 2001 has been the most remarkable success in the story of car design in the past decade - to some a cynical travesty, to others pure delight. Now it is joined by Fiat's 'new' 500. Is this survival or revival? Along with the Vespa, the original Fiat Cinquecento of 1957 was one of the great symbols of the ricostruzione, or rebuilding, of postwar Italy. There is a marble statue of one outside the Mirafiori factory in Turin. The 500 was, quite literally, the car that got Italy on the move: the brief was 'every worker should have a car'. And it was a car defined by Italian townscape: perhaps the smallest viable four-seater ever. Small cars stimulate genius in the designer. Dante Giacosa disapproved of excess and was inspired by simplicity. The 500 had nearly-flat glass but clever contouring of the body panels made the whole appear as a generous - if tiny - sculpture, not a frugal box. The original 500 won Italy's leading design prize, the Compasso d'Oro, in 1959, and remained in production until 1975. There followed for Fiat many bleak years, with often indifferent products. All the dolce vita in the mondo could not compete with Japanese quality and reliability. But the recent revival of the adored Cinquecento is a happy symbol of the revival of Fiat itself. Its success has surprised even its makers, selling out in every territory. In London it will be turning heads at the car's launch in 21 January, when a baby Fiat will mesmerise partygoers and passers-by as it revolves in a pod of the London Eye. Although the Fiat Nuova 500, which is made in Poland, owes nothing technically to the rear-engined original (it is based on the front-engined Fiat Panda), Roberto Giolito's design pays frank homage to Giacosa. It would be deprecating to call it 'cute' but Giolito has certainly rediscovered all the charm of 1957. The 500 comes in marvellous period pastel colours and has a cream plastic instrument panel which, magically, evokes the Fifties while being in fact totally original. See one and you want one. Fiat's greatest asset is its connection to Italy's indiscriminate love of life and art. Purists may carp but there is not much wrong with the renewal of the pleasure principle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
