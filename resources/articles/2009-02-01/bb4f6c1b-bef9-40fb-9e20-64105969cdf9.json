Saunders stopped the Hungarian fighter Attila Molnar in the second round, before Gavin beat his Georgian opponent George Kadaria in the fourth. Saunders, 19, who came to prominence at the Beijing Olympics, was making his professional debut alongside the 2008 Games gold medalist James DeGale. Saunders made light work of his bout, forcing the end after one minute and 47 seconds of round two. Saunders rushed into action from the first bell, clearly eager to impress, and landed some heavy combinations from the off. Against a limited opponent - albeit one with a relatively respectable record of 12-12-6 - Saunders could barely miss the target, landing stiff jabs, hooks and right hands. A right uppercut was the pick of the round and Saunders followed it with a solid left soon after. He tempered his aggression somewhat at the start of the second and even turned southpaw very briefly, before landing a good left-right to Molnar's head. That prompted him to step up the assault with further attacks to the head and when a string of blows landed on a target who was barely moving to slip the punches, referee John Keane stepped in to wave it off. Gavin was also impressive in his first contest as a pro. The light-welterweight, 23, impressed on home territory, arriving to the ring wearing shorts and a gown resplendent in Birmingham City colours. He was forced to weather an early onslaught as Kadaria attacked from the bell and though he responded with some good body shots - and was largely in control - he was caught with the best punch of the round when the Georgian landed a good right hand. It was more of the same in the second round with Gavin opting to box and Kadaria reduced to swinging wildly. Gavin attacked with more fury in the third - perhaps mindful of the friendly rivalry between the three debutants. A series of body shots weakened Kadaria, setting up a nice three-punch combination to the head. Moments later Kadaria was on the floor - twice - but both times it was ruled a slip by referee Keane. Gavin also suffered a nasty cut on the bridge of his nose, possibly from a clash of heads. In the final round, Gavin anxiously pursued the early end by constantly walking his opponent down and ceaselessly throwing shots. And his wish came true when Keane saw little point in allowing the fight to continue, handing him the technical knockout with a minute and 21 seconds of the fight remaining. Earlier, Don Broadhurst made a successful first defence of his Commonwealth super-flyweight title with an 11th-round stoppage of the Ghanaian Isaac Owusu. Broadhurst was not afraid to trade shots with the challenger and floored his man in the first round. Broadhurst - whose record now stands at 10-0 with two stoppages - continued to plug away and when he put Owusu down again in the 11th, the stoppage soon followed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
