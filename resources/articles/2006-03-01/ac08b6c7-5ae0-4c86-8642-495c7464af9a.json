He pledged his support for the lecturers who plan an official strike over pay next Tuesday, after he attended a debate on the future of top-up fees as part of a parliamentary lobby organised by the National Union of Students (NUS). Mr Johnson said: \"I have some sympathy with the current proposed strike by the lecturers and why they feel so hard done by when you consider in real terms their academic pay has fallen by 40% in the last 20 years. \"Their pay has failed to keep pace with other groups in the public sector such as headteachers and doctors.\" The MP was, however, reluctant to back the current campaign by the NUS which is calling on MPs to block the proposed removal of the \u00a33,000 cap on tuition fees. The NUS is worried that if the cap is lifted student debt will soar and will it deter students from going into higher education. But Mr Johnson said it was too early to say whether the cap should be lifted before it was clear how the new system of top up fees, which is being introduced in September, worked. Earlier this afternoon the Liberal Democrats shadow education spokesman, Edward Davey, said ministers were \"complacent\" about the impact tuition fees and top-up fees would have on students and their families. Speaking at the student lobby debate, he said: \"The truth is getting saddled with thousands of pounds worth of debt won't just discourage people from going to university but will change their choice of career, when they get married and when they can afford to buy a house. \"Deciding to study for a degree should be based on someone's academic ability, not his or her ability to manage debt.\" But the minister for higher education, Bill Rammell, said in a statement ahead of today's lobby that the government was standing firm on its higher education funding reforms. He said there would be an independent review of the effect of top up fees in 2009 before any decision was taken on the future of the financial cap. Any changes in the cash ceiling would require the support of both MPs and peers in the House of Lords, he said earlier this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
