August 2015, to be precise, for Spurs in the Audi Cup at the Allianz Arena, Munich. Alli was 19, a \u00a35m signing from Milton Keynes Dons thrown into the deep end against Real Madrid, and at least he was courteous enough not to ruffle Modric\u2019s hair, Gazza-style, as he slipped the ball through his opponent\u2019s legs. Modric, he recalls, collared him in the tunnel and called him a \u201clittle bugger\u201d. Though the suspicion remains that he might have toned down the language. OK, in the grand scheme of things, it will not count for a lot, nearly three years on, when England meet Croatia in Moscow on Wednesday for a place in a World Cup final. All the same, there was something strangely reassuring, from an English perspective, to hear Alli regaling this story. \u201cI always enjoy a good nutmeg,\u201d was his take. Especially when the person who has just let the ball go through his legs is one of the world\u2019s category-A footballers. To clarify, Alli was not being controversial here or disrespectful in the slightest. Indeed, he also made the point that if England were to win this semi-final a lot would depend on how they managed to deal with Modric\u2019s intelligence on the ball. A nutmeg is a nutmeg. It is not a goal, or a game-defining moment, or a killer pass, or a Champions League medal (of which Modric has four). But it is a reminder, in its own small way, that Alli is not the kind of footballer to suffer any sense of inferiority complex. Another comes when he is asked if he the slightest bit nervous \u2013 \u201cexcited, not nervous,\u201d he responds \u2013 and, again, when it is pointed out to him that he has a pretty impressive record when it comes to scoring on the big occasions. Since 2016, he has scored twice against Manchester United, twice against Manchester City, five times against Chelsea, once against Arsenal and once against Liverpool. Yet Alli wants to make a point of his own. \u201cI score against other teams as well,\u201d he says. England will need this confidence, one imagines, if they are to win their first World Cup semi-final since 1990, six years before Alli was even born, and then return to the Luzhniki Stadium on Sunday to see off France or Belgium in the final. Yet it would be a mistake to think that Alli cannot assess himself with a critical eye, too, and by his own admission he is not entirely satisfied with his own World Cup performances. Gareth Southgate identified him for special acclaim after the opening win against Tunisia but that was also the match when the Tottenham Hotspur player damaged a thigh. Alli did not play again in the group stages. He returned for the Colombia game and, though he scored in the 2-0 win over Sweden, he sounded almost apologetic for the way he had performed in England\u2019s quarter-final victory. \u201cI said to my family afterwards that it was weird because I didn\u2019t feel nervous or anything like that. I don\u2019t really ever get nervous anyway. But you know sometimes that you can have games where your control isn\u2019t as good as it should be, or your decision-making isn\u2019t as sharp as normal. I felt like it was one of those games. I\u2019ve spoken to the manager about it and some of my team-mates. I didn\u2019t feel like I was playing as well as I should have been, especially in the first half. \u201cDefensively, I did my job, and did what I needed to do, but I wanted to be on the ball, creating chances and being a threat. I felt like my movement was good but I just wasn\u2019t sharp enough. I didn\u2019t keep the ball as much as I should have. To score ... it gives you a lift. But I\u2019m my own biggest critic. I know I can play better than that.\u201d In keeping with a lot of Southgate\u2019s players, Alli\u2019s air of self-confidence is tinged with the humility that comes from starting in the lower leagues. Here, for example, he has been joking with Danny Welbeck about the night in 2014 when Milton Keynes Dons played Manchester United in the League Cup and won 4-0. The young Alli \u2013 to his embarrassment now \u2013 asked for Welbeck\u2019s shirt that night and was politely turned down. \u201cI\u2019ve still got my shirt,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to give him mine, I just wanted his.\u201d As for the least glamorous surroundings from those days, Alli recalls one night in League One, in February 2015, when Milton Keynes Dons were playing Bradford City on a \u201chorrible pitch\u201d at Valley Parade and \u201ca horrible, aggressive game ... every time I got the ball people would be kicking, swearing.\u201d Bradford won 2-1 and Alli scored the visitors\u2019 goal. What he seems to have forgotten is that the goalkeeper he beat that night was a 20-year-old rookie by the name of Jordan Pickford, on loan from Sunderland. Three years on, they are England teammates, attempting to win the biggest competition of all, and Alli says he will be going through his usual \u2013 or unusual, depending on your views \u2013 superstitions in the hope they bring the team luck. That includes an eight-minute ice bath the night before the match \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s just a superstition\u201d \u2013 and saying a prayer before he goes on to the pitch in Moscow. He gets his right leg ready first and has tape on his left knee. \u201cThat\u2019s a superstition as well,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe first game [against Tunisia] was the first in ages I haven\u2019t had it on and I got injured, so I\u2019m going to be keeping it on again.\u201d The prayer is simple: \u201cThat I score and we win.\u201d And would he dare try the same again with Modric? \u201cNutmeg him? Hopefully. I\u2019m not going to focus on that. But it would be nice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
