That\u2019s why they love the Premier League. It\u2019s the buzz around the game. It\u2019s the emotion in each tackle and each header, each goal. You\u2019re not only celebrating that goal for yourself and the team but also celebrating with all these thousands of people around you.\u201d Germany\u2019s visit to Wembley on Saturday is set to smash England\u2019s record home attendance of 45,619 and possibly break the 2012 Olympic final record for a women\u2019s game in England, set by the 80,203 fans who watched USA beat Japan. The mood is high. Sitting in St George\u2019s Park, Bronze laughs at the memory of her first cap. \u201cBurton? When did I play in Burton?\u201d she asks with a grin, when reminded of the then impressive 5,327 fans who watched her debut in 2013. \u201cIt must have been Japan,\u201d she says, correctly. \u201cJust before the Euros in 2013. I was a younger player, inexperienced, but I still remember going to that tournament and it was just like playing on the weekend. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really this big, kind of, moment. Now we\u2019re not even playing in a tournament; we\u2019re playing at Wembley, it\u2019s what everyone\u2019s talking about, it\u2019s on TV in France, TV around the world, England against Germany, and it\u2019s a friendly. \u201cI think it\u2019s funny when people ask me where the game\u2019s going to be in five years\u2019 time. I always think I just don\u2019t know because I would never have expected it to be here now today. It\u2019s come on so much in the six years since I made my debut. Everything that you think it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s just more.\u201d The growth mirrors Bronze\u2019s rise. There is some symmetry to England filling Wembley in the year the right-back was crowned the European player of the year. It is something Bronze has been thinking about. \u201cPeople ask me how the media or the profile of the game is now and I\u2019m like: \u2018I have literally grown with the profile of the game.\u2019 \u201cMy age group \u2013 Toni Duggan, Jordan Nobbs \u2013 we\u2019ve all grown in the game and in the England squad at the same time and as the profile has grown so it\u2019s probably an easier transition for us compared to the likes of Jill Scott, who has been around a lot longer. \u201cSomeone said to me that we\u2019re the last generation of the ones who kind of stuck it in the mud in the beginning but it\u2019s nice to have been at both ends of the spectrum. \u201cWe\u2019ve come from paying to play. I had to pay for my kit to play on a Sunday and things like that. It definitely makes you appreciate things more and you see things from a different perspective.\u201d For Bronze, at international level at least, the argument of not playing in big stadiums for fear of rattling around is long gone. \u201cWe are getting above-average crowds at every single game now. And you know what? The England men don\u2019t sell out every single game. That\u2019s normal, it\u2019s football. The Premier League\u2019s the same. I think we know we\u2019re on that level now but it\u2019s kind of our responsibility to keep that going by playing the football that people want to see.\u201d Five years ago England\u2019s 3-0 defeat by Germany at Wembley pulled in that record home crowd, but the state of the nation\u2019s football was very different. \u201cI\u2019m not playing centre-half any more,\u201d Bronze, says laughing, when asked how much things have changed. \u201cI\u2019m not playing on the left side either with my dodgy left foot! \u201cEverything\u2019s changed,\u201d she says more seriously. \u201cSince then we\u2019ve beaten Germany for a start \u2013 we still hadn\u2019t recorded a win against them at that time, it was only later on when we beat them at the 2015 World Cup. \u201cThe last time it was the excitement of Wembley and Germany, then even a draw against them was an amazing achievement. Now it\u2019s like: \u2018We\u2019re playing at Wembley? Yeah,\u2019\u201d she shrugs. \u201cA lot of us do on a regular basis now. And playing against Germany? Fine, we\u2019re used to playing against these teams, these players, whether it\u2019s in our team at club level or against them at club level. It was a bit of a spectacle and a bit of an event for us to play Germany then, whereas now we\u2019re England and we\u2019re a top team and we know that.\u201d One Germany player in particular is well known to Bronze. The Budapest-born playmaker Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n is more than a teammate at Lyon. Bronze counts her as a friend and speaks with awe of the way Marozs\u00e1n plays. \u201cSome of the girls at Lyon said they\u2019d hate to play against Maro. People ask whether I\u2019ll play in midfield but do you know what? I would prefer to play against her in midfield than as a full-back. She literally has no time on the ball and she just picks these passes out of nowhere. So as a full-back, I\u2019m going: \u2018OK, the midfielder\u2019s there\u2019 and she just pings it behind to the player that I\u2019m supposed to be marking and it just makes me look like an idiot. \u201cI see it because I play with her every single day. I\u2019ve learned to appreciate that she sees things and is capable of things I don\u2019t think any other women\u2019s player really is capable of right now. And I\u2019m excited she\u2019s part of this German team playing in England. The England fans get to come and watch us but they\u2019ve got this player on the other team that \u2026 I hope has a good game so they can see how amazing she is as a player. And if she\u2019s playing well it means we have to play better than her. It makes for a good game of football, which is what I\u2019m looking forward to most: having a good game of football \u2026 and winning.\u201d Winning will be tough because the Lionesses have struggled since the World Cup but Bronze is unconcerned. \u201cWe know that we\u2019ve put on good performances but we haven\u2019t got results. Then we got a result against Portugal but we didn\u2019t necessarily put on the best performance, so it\u2019s swings and roundabouts; you get that a lot in football. \u201cWe know that as an England team planning for Euro 2021 is what the goal is. We\u2019re not quite perfect yet but we know the results will come eventually. If it takes until 2021 for us to go unbeaten all year I\u2019ll take that.\u201d Stepping out in front of a potential 90,000 crowd does not disturb Bronze. \u201cI\u2019m not a player to get choked up,\u201d she says, grinning. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s nice to have people come to watch, I love playing in front of the big crowds; I want them to be there but it\u2019s not an emotional thing for me. It\u2019s more an excitement thing. It just makes me happy. \u201cEven when I\u2019ve played for Lyon at PSG, and there\u2019s been 15-20,000 PSG fans there? Boom. When you come on the pitch it makes me smile because even though they\u2019re against me I\u2019m just like: \u2018This is fun, this is exciting.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling, the energy that it gives you. It\u2019s gonna bring out the best in us because it\u2019s what it does to the best teams.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
