Having surrendered a 2-0 lead late on at Ninian Park to hand the Welsh club a replay, goals from the Cardiff-born teenager Lee Fowler, the thirty-something Dean Holdsworth and Jay Bothroyd ensured Gary McAllister's team were not so charitable as they had been 11 days earlier. Yet Coventry's tentative start suggested they were still coming to terms with events of the first meeting. Judging by his first goal-kick, Coventry's goalkeeper Morten Hylgaard was more nervous than most. It resulted in a perfect pass for Robert Earnshaw before Richard Shaw spared Hyldgaard further embarassment with a superbly timed sliding tackle. The Sky Blues appeared equally twitchy at the other end, not least when Fowler's lofted ball down the inside-right channel set up a tussle between Bothroyd and Gary Croft. There was a strong suspicion of handball by the Cardiff player but any illegality only aided Bothroyd as he advanced on Neil Alexander before shooting wastefully into the side-netting. The same player followed suit from a corner shortly afterwards, although this time the former Arsenal striker showed rather more composure. And that was mirrored in the 21st minute when Bothroyd provided the assist for Fowler to put Coventry in front. Having collected a throw-out from Hyldgaard, Bothroyd turned neatly before chipping the ball over Cardiff's back three to leave Fowler one on one with Alexander. This time there was no reprieve for the goalkeeper as the Cardiff-born midfielder coolly lofted the ball past him. Fowler made another entry into Graham Poll's notebook after taking umbrage after an over-zealous challenge by the former Coventry midfielder Willie Boland. Cardiff's response was equally spirited and they came within a crossbar's width of equalising in the 33rd minute when Earnshaw fired against it, his close-range shot taking a deflection off Mo Konjic, after Jason Bowen had done the spadework. Coventry began the second half clearly looking to add a second goal and were rewarded when Dean Holdsworth obliged with his first goal for the club. Like Fowler, Holdsworth's strike, a curling right-foot shot that left Alexander helpless to intervene. Cardiff refused to submit and came within inches of scoring when Peter Thorne headed a prodigious throw from Andy Legg against the crossbar. Thorne caused Hyldergaard another anxious moment shortly afterwards, this time his header forcing the goal keeper to scramble along his goal line to make the save.
