Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna, who oversaw the creation of Mexico\u2019s federal police, was arrested in Texas on Monday. He helped oversee the militarized crackdown on organized crime which was launched in 2006 by the then president, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, and has continued with slight modifications ever since. But according to the indictment against him unsealed on Tuesday, Garc\u00eda Luna \u201creceived millions of dollars in bribes from the Sinaloa cartel in exchange for providing protection for its drug trafficking activities\u201d. \u201cGarc\u00eda Luna stands accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes from \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa cartel while he controlled Mexico\u2019s federal police force and was responsible for ensuring public safety in Mexico,\u201d said US attorney Richard P Donoghue. \u201cToday\u2019s arrest demonstrates our resolve to bring to justice those who help cartels inflict devastating harm on the United States and Mexico, regardless of the positions they held while committing their crimes.\u201d Garc\u00eda Luna led Mexico\u2019s federal investigation agency from 2001 to 2005, and from 2006 to 2012, he served under Calder\u00f3n as secretary of public security. Calder\u00f3n deployed troops against the cartels in December 2006, but the crackdown unleashed a wave of violence which has claimed more than 200,000 lives, left more than 35,000 missing and continues today. The arrest of Calder\u00f3n\u2019s right-hand man delivers a serious blow to the former leader, a prominent critic of the current president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has promised a \u201chugs not bullets\u201d strategy of tackling the social roots of crime. \u201cThis is a bombshell,\u201d said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a commentator in Mexico City. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a detention of such a high-ranking Mexican official.\u201d Calder\u00f3n stood steadfastly by Garc\u00eda Luna despite growing allegations of impropriety and accusations that security forces concentrated their efforts against the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s rivals. A 2010 analysis of crime figures by NPR found that only 12% of people arrested, prosecuted or sentenced for drug, organised crime and weapons offences had ties to the Sinaloa cartel. \u201cThis guy probably knows where all the bodies are buried and all other kinds of secrets involving political figures \u2013 the most important aspect of drug trafficking together with the money trail,\u201d said Jorge Kawas, a security analyst in the northern city of Monterrey. On Tuesday Calder\u00f3n tweeted that he only learned of the arrest through social media. \u201cMy position will always be in favour of justice and the law,\u201d he said. According to the indictment, cartel bagmen twice delivered briefcases containing millions of dollars to Garc\u00eda Luna. In 2018, former cartel member Jes\u00fas Zambada testified at the trial of the Sinaloa kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n that he personally made at least $6m in hidden payments to Garc\u00eda Luna, on behalf of his older brother, cartel boss Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada. In exchange for the bribes, the Sinaloa cartel obtained safe passage for its drug shipments, inside details of police investigations, and information about rival drug cartels, the indictment said. Garc\u00eda Luna departed Mexico after Calder\u00f3n left office in December 2012. Prosecutors allege Garc\u00eda Luna lied to US authorities about his activities for the cartel when he applied for naturalisation in 2018. \u201cAccording to financial records obtained by the government, by the time Garc\u00eda Luna relocated to the United States in 2012, he had amassed a personal fortune of millions of dollars,\u201d the indictment said. Mike Vigil, a former DEA chief of international operations, said he and other US anti-narcotics agents had worked closely with Garc\u00eda Luna. \u201cI never saw any issue of corruption, any issue which compromised any of our operations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever we needed, he provided without question. We probably worked better with him than any other Mexican official.\u201d Garc\u00eda Luna is charged with drug-trafficking conspiracy and making false statements. If convicted on the drug-trafficking charges, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and could receive a life sentence. \ufeff"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
