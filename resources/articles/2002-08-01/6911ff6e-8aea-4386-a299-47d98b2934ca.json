The latest delay follows promises from project officials to MPs on the culture committee that the funding would be in place by the end of July. WestLB insisted last night it would be able to hand over the money to build a new 90,000-seat stadium on the site \"within August\". Large loans for such ambitious projects do not usually come from one bank but are split up into smaller pieces to spread the weight of the loan - and the risk. While WestLB has agreed to make a loan - thought to be at least \u00a3400m - for Wembley it has still been asking rival banks to take part in a syndicate so that it can reduce its exposure. Financial sources indicated last night that a number of banks had recently told WestLB's Robin Saunders, the high-profile US financier who is leading the fund-raising exercise, that they did not want to participate in the syndicate after taking six weeks to scrutinise the business plan. \"It looks very doubtful,\" one senior City source said last night. However, WestLB insisted that it had signed up enough banks to join the syndicate and that it hoped to hand over the money this month. Wembley National Stadium Limited, the company set up by the Football Association to run the project, was even more upbeat. A spokesman said: \"We're a few days from tying up our side of the financing. We feel we are almost there.\" WNSL said it was confident that demolition work would begin on the twin-towered stadium in September- after two years of political and financial problems that caused the first attempt to redevelop the north London site to be scaled back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
