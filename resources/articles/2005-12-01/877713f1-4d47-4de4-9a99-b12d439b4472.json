She made the request of Bradley Murdoch, 47, shortly after he was convicted of murdering the 28-year-old British backpacker in the Australian outback. After the drug runner's conviction following an eight-week trial, Ms Lees, 32, spoke to the media on the steps of the Northern Territory supreme court in Darwin, standing alongside Mr Falconio's parents Joan and Luciano and his brother Paul. Ms Lees, of Brighton, who burst into tears and buried her head in her hands when the guilty verdict was read out, said they were \"obviously delighted\" at the \"unanimous verdict\". But she added: \"I would like Bradley John Murdoch to seriously consider telling me, Joan and Luciano what he has done with Pete.\" All attempts by police and aboriginal trackers to find the body have failed. Authorities believe Murdoch, a mechanic from the north-west resort town of Broome, hid the corpse somewhere in the outback, and the trial heard that he had told an associate that he knew \"how to hide a body\". Luciano Falconio, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, told reporters: \"We wish that we could find Peter. We don't get any closure until we find Peter. We know it's extremely difficult, as you know, with the Northern Territory what it is. We cannot put a closure.\" Ms Lees told the trial she had not seen her boyfriend since Murdoch flagged down the couple's camper van in July 2001 on the Stuart Highway and lured Mr Falconio round the back of it, where the prosecution said he killed him with a single gunshot. Today, Ms Lees, who Murdoch attempted to abduct but who managed to escape and hide in the bush, said the verdict had followed a \"traumatic\" four years. She said the verdict \"eased the burden\" she and the family had faced. \"It's the conclusion of an intense period of stress for myself and the Falconio family. This will enable us to take another step in the grieving process for Pete,\" Ms Lees said. She went on: \"Over the past four years I have received a great deal of help and support from friends and family both here and at home. Those concerned, they know who they are and I'd like to say thank you. \"I'd also like to acknowledge the two truck drivers, Vince Millar and Rodney Adams, who took me to safety on that night.\" Ms Lees also said that she had not cooperated with any of the upcoming books that have been written about the case. She said: \"There are several books about these events due for publishing after the verdict. I want to say for the record that the authors of these books have not spoken to me.\" Asked about the verdict, Luciano Falconio said: \"I was very, very happy indeed. It's upsetting but I'm happy for myself.\" Joan Falconio said: \"Everything I say will be said on Thursday in court in my victim impact statement, and I will say everything to everybody.\" Murdoch receives a mandatory life sentence but the terms of that sentence - and any minimum tariff - will be determined on Thursday. On the steps of the court, Murdoch's lawyer, Grant Algie, said he had been instructed to appeal. \"Obviously we are disappointed with the result,\" he said. \"In the circumstances, there's nothing more I can properly say.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
