Standards, which were already too low, had fallen, the regulator\u2019s inspectors reported. The Big Four firms were told to \u201cact swiftly to reverse the decline\u201d. KMPG (famous audit: Carillion) was the worst of the bunch and was put in the equivalent of special measures. After such public shaming, and with the Competition and Markets Authority on the prowl, you would expect the well-paid partners at all the professional firms to put their houses in order, right? Wrong. The FRC\u2019s latest report has landed and it describes more of the same. One in four audits across the industry was below standard, so performance was not even close to the watchdog\u2019s acceptability target of 90%. None of the firms reached that par score. PwC (famous audit: BHS) has replaced KMPG as the laggard within the Big Four with only 65% of its audits deemed acceptable. PwC scored 90% as recently as two years ago. The news is worse for anyone who fondly believes salvation lies in empowering the next tier of auditors to disrupt the comfortable lives of the big firms. The worst performer was Grant Thornton (famous audit: Patisserie Valerie) where four out of eight inspected audits were not up to scratch, which goes some way to explaining why the firm itself has volunteered not to pitch for auditing work at FTSE 350 companies. Grant Thornton\u2019s quality was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201ca matter of deep concern,\u201d said the FRC. Naturally everyone can display an action plan showing how more money will be invested in technology, people and training. Year after year, though, the FRC\u2019s study points to the same deep cultural failure: auditors\u2019 inability to deploy professional scepticism and to challenge management\u2019s assumptions. Familiarity, the regulator suggests, is a factor. An auditor can come to see the company, rather than the investors, as \u201cthe client\u201d. Until this mindset shifts, it\u2019s questionable whether any level of investment will move the dial meaningfully. The CMA\u2019s proposed remedy is an \u201coperational split\u201d between professional firms\u2019 audit and consulting divisions. The two halves would have separate management teams, accounts and bonus pools. The policy would represent a start. Yet this situation surely also demands fines that actually hurt. In especially gruesome cases, the FRC can stir itself to impose penalties of \u00a310m on auditors. Such a sum may sound chunky but it barely counts as small change in this industry. PwC\u2019s profits in the UK last year were \u00a3935m, which allowed the 915 partners to earn an average of \u00a3712,000 each, an increase of 9% on the year. The numbers are similar at other big firms. It is a point to remember as the auditors tweak and update their statements of good intentions. Nobody\u2019s livelihood properly depends on ensuring self-improvement happens. Sky-high optimism at Virgin Galactic? Sir Richard Branson reckons $1bn of capital has been ploughed into Virgin Galactic since 2004, so valuing the space tourism venture at $1.5bn \u2013 as implied by the public listing \u2013 is not a case of exploring new frontiers. In the broadly-defined \u201ctech\u201d sector, you can find wilder valuations. All the same, there\u2019s an overdose of optimism in the assertion that Virgin Galactic will generate revenues of $600m and top-line operating profits of $270m in 2023. Where are all these customers supposedly willing to pay $250,000 for a 90-minute flight? A few celebrities have put down deposits but the business will require 2,400 full-price customers to sell $600m-worth of tickets. And it will need to achieve those sales every year to justify the valuation, which could be the biggest problem since repeat custom may be thin. And it\u2019s all supposed to happen within four years. As an investment, Ryanair looks the better bet. GDPR has become a nice little earner Here comes the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), causing terror again. On Monday, it whacked British Airways with a proposed \u00a3183m fine for data breaches. Now it\u2019s the turn of hotel chain Marriott International to take a \u00a399m hit for data offences at its Starwood business. So the ICO\u2019s tally this week has reached a quarter of billion quid and it\u2019s not even Friday. The penalties have to withstand inevitable legal challenges, it should be said. But one assumes the ICO has done its homework and understands the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules better than the miscreant companies. If so, this is becoming a nice little earner for the Treasury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
