This time last year Fulham were 19th in the Premier League, four points from safety and staring down the barrel of potentially ruinous relegation. Salvation came in the form of four wins in their final five matches and, having carried some form into this season, they now stand in eighth place as they chase a spot in the inaugural Europa League. The fact that Fulham have used only 24 players in the league this season \u2013 fewer than all but three teams \u2013 attests to how much Hodgson has extracted from relatively meagre resources. It also indicates the strain his squad would feel if required to contest an extra 21 matches, which is the number it would take to win the Uefa Cup's replacement competition. \"We've had a cursory meeting with the chairman about it, and myself, [the chief executive] Alistair Macintosh and [assistant manager] Mike Kelly have been working on some ideas. Once we've finalised them we'll put our suggestions to the chairman in a more serious way.\" Perhaps the most important signing Fulham could make is that of the current centre-back Brede Hangeland, whose performances since a \u00a32.5m move from FC Copenhagen in January 2007 have been key in why Fulham boast the best defensive record outside the top four. The downside of Hangeland's displaysis that they have reputedly attracted interest from Europe's aristocrats, though Hodgson denied reports that the Norwegian has rejected a new contract offer and expressed his confidence that he will soon commit his medium-term future to Craven Cottage. \"We're in the throes of preparing a contract suggestion that he's more than happy to receive,\" said Hodgson. \"He certainly hasn't turned anything down because as yet we haven't made a new offer.\" Qualifying for Europe may influence Hangeland's decision and those of other targets of eventual Fulham offers. Any summer spending spree will, however, be in keeping with the club's modest resources, though Hodgson, emboldened by his own record, knows that this does not preclude continued high achievement. \"Our squad is likely to remain quite small next season but no smaller than the ones I had at Malmo when we used to knock out teams such as Inter and Ajax. So we're not fearful of Europe. If we get there we'll be very happy to participate and we'll do our best.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
