Ticketek released a statement on Wednesday morning announcing the American singer\u2019s cancellation. Brown was told by the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, in late September that his visa application would be denied unless he could show cause why it should not be within 28 days. It is not known whether he did so \u2013 or even if he applied for a visa in the first instance. A spokeswoman for the Department of Border Control and Immigration said it would not discuss any material provided to the minister by either Brown or his representative for reasons of privacy. Brown had applied for a work visa to perform in New Zealand last week. Tickets were still on sale for the Australian leg of the One Hell of a Nite tour, due to start at the Perth Arena on 9 December, as recently as Tuesday. Brown was also due to perform at Melbourne\u2019s Rod Laver Arena on 12 December, Allphones Arena in Sydney on 14 December and Brisbane Entertainment Centre on 16 December, before a show in Auckland on 18 December. \u201cMr Brown and the promoters both remain positive that the tour will take place in the near future,\u201d the statement posted to Ticketek\u2019s website said. \u201cMr Brown wishes to express his deepest gratitude to the fans for their support and looks forward to a successful tour in the near future.\u201d Refunds were offered to those who had bought tickets. Advance ticket sale numbers for the tour are not known. The tour\u2019s viability was thrown into doubt in September, when the advocacy group GetUp! petitioned for Brown to be refused entry to Australia over his conviction for domestic violence. Brown pleaded guilty to attacking his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. But GetUp! later retracted its campaign after it was criticised for hypocrisy in failing to target other artists convicted of similar offences. GetUp! acknowledged it had \u201csupported a racist narrative that sees men of colour unfairly targeted, and stereotyped as more violent than their white counterparts\u201d. In late September Brown tweeted that he would be \u201cmore than grateful to come to Australia to raise awareness about domestic violence\u201d. The immigration minister has ultimate discretion on whether people with convictions can be granted a visa. Brown has toured in Australia twice since his conviction, in 2011 and 2012. Ticketek and Brown\u2019s promoter have been contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
