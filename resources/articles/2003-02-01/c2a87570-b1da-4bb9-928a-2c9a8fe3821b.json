Those three little words have such an impact: worldwide media coverage, the ongoing questioning of why those attacks against America happened, and now the threat of war. Even as members of the public mean, we have a greater understanding of the impact terrorism has on each of us, personally. The IRA bombings of London and Manchester in 1996 highlighted the vulnerability of corporations. To learn actively from how other organisations handle incidents, business continuity practitioners all over the United Kingdom have made and refined their business resiliency plans, procedures and protocols. But pre-planning for disasters has gone on, mainly unnoticed by the public, for decades so that most large organisations now have some form of business continuity in place, whether it be sophisticated alternative site arrangements, to just call-out chains with staff telephone numbers. No one in his or her teenage years would think of aspiring to be a business continuity manager. It's not a sexy profession. Mainly it's just common sense. You don't need to be rocket scientist, just analytical and good at asking why? But there is a backbone of dedicated professionals, who are entrusted with ensuring that should the worst happen, the organisation can continue functioning. Indeed, that they could service their customers whilst in the midst of chaos, and still meet their customers' demands in terms of speed of response, accuracy and contactability. If an organisation cannot answer its customers' calls (especially if in the private sectors), then its competitors will only be too happy to! Normally, business continuity hits the headlines when things go wrong. If an organisation can't get up and running after a major fire, or if the launch of a new website doesn't go according to plan, the media inevitably ask: \"What planning did they have in place, why weren't procedures documented, or even why wasn't the site fully tested?\" This can do more damage to an organisation's reputation than anything else. If everything goes well, on the other hand, another question is often asked internally: \"Was it really necessary to spend all that money on testing and contingencies, when we knew it would go smoothly all along?\" So what is business continuity? First, it should be pointed out that business continuity isn't just about planning. BC professionals prefer the term business continuity management (BCM) or service continuity, as this shows it takes more than a piece of paper to ensure business resiliency. Many people think that it's all about ensuring you have back-up systems in place, in case of an IT outage. This is part of the process, but only part. Business continuity management is an umbrella term used to describe measures such as planning, testing/exercising, maintenance and awareness protocols than an organisation institutes to ensure it can continue servicing it's customers in the event of an unforeseen incident. BCM takes different formats in different industrial sectors and indeed even organisations within the same sector have different measures and procedures in place. Each organisation tailors the process to suit its needs, risks and controls. Most large organisations have some form of business continuity plans which have been written based upon the risks inherent to them, taking into account the likelihood, frequency and severity of those risks. Plans are normally written based on a business impact analysis, which allows the organisation involved to understand and quantify the risks it faces. Based on this groundwork, plans and procedures can then be written. In many instances, the plans themselves become redundant, as the process of planning is far more important than the plans themselves. To ensure the plans work, they must be exercised. In most organisations this is done in three main ways: Scenario-based walkthrough: This is where a facilitator presents a scenario to key staff and asks them to use their plans to resolve the incident. Physical/relocation testing: This involves moving staff from one location to another, by using the information contained in their plans to make the move and initiate their processes and functions at their new location. Call chain testing: This is an unannounced call to key staff outwith office hours to ensure information contained in the plans can be verified. Obviously, there are many other ways of validating plans and each organisation tailors exercising to suit its needs, based on the organisation's size and complexity of planning mechanisms. Business continuity management is part of an overall risk management approach, which allows an organisation to identify, evaluate or assess its risks and then implement measures to minimise or control them. Risk management itself has become increasingly important to organisations over recent years with the advent of the Turnbull report on responsibilities within financial services, and the concept of legal culpability known as corporate manslaughter. It is unfortunate, however, that it is still mainly medium to large organisations that are the main \"users\" of business continuity and risk management. In today's economic climate, with the increased perception of risks generally, small companies are failing to bring these ideas fully on board. As either an employer or employee, ask yourself this question: \"What do we have in place in terms of business continuity? What would we do in the event of a disaster?\" If the answer is nothing, what can you do about it? Something as simple as arranging for vital information to be backed up off-site and ensuring key staff contact details are held outwith the office, can mean the difference between business survival and business demise. In encouraging small businesses to implement business continuity, we can help build a resilient community, where everyone can respond effectively, rather than leaving it to the big boys! In taking these small steps, we can secure not only our economy and our jobs but we can also help protect our ways of life. - Lorna Anderson is full-time group continuity services relationship manager with Standard Life in Edinburgh.
