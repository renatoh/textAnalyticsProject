After examining the teeth of 17th-century skulls, researchers from Queen Mary University of London found fewer missing teeth and less decay than today, blaming widespread sugar consumption and lack of basic hygiene for the sorry state of our teeth. Here, then, is an ultimate guide to optimum dental care. How should you clean your teeth? The steadfast rule of brushing is to stick to the two-minute rule using a good fluoride toothpaste. \u201cThe optimum level of fluoride for anyone aged three and over is between 1,350ppm and 1,500ppm, so it doesn\u2019t matter too much which brand you\u2019re using as long as it has that level of fluoride,\u201d says Karen Coates, a dental adviser at the Oral Health Foundation. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to wet the brush. With a pea-sized amount of toothpaste \u2013 you don\u2019t have to fill the whole brush \u2013 use small, circular movements concentrating on every area of the teeth.\u201d Coates adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between brushing effectively and overbrushing. There is evidence that electric brushes give a better clean than a manual, and also have the benefit of a timer (so you\u2019re more likely to brush for two minutes) and a pressure sensor (so you can\u2019t press too hard). Overbrushing can damage the teeth and gums, and can cause recession.\u201d Spit or rinse? The consensus is: spit, don\u2019t rinse. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve brushed your teeth, just spit out the excess, but don\u2019t rinse your mouth, as you\u2019d just be rinsing out all that fluoride you\u2019ve just put on,\u201d says Coates. \u201cThe residual bits of fluoride will stay on the teeth for about 30 minutes after brushing.\u201d What should you use? Damien Walmsley, a scientific adviser for the British Dental Association, recommends using a medium-sized toothbrush that can get to hard-to-reach places at the back of the mouth. Coates adds that brushing can clean the sides, the inside and the biting surface, but a toothbrush alone will not clean all the surfaces of the teeth, so it\u2019s best to use interdental brushes or floss to clean in between your teeth once a day. What about mouthwash? \u201cMouthwash is not a substitute for brushing your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste,\u201d says Walmsley. \u201cIt only has a small effect in terms of freshening your breath and having a nice taste.\u201d Coates adds that rinsing with mouthwash straight after brushing the teeth is counterproductive as it removes the fluoride. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to use mouthwash, do this at a different time to brushing your teeth because one will counteract the other,\u201d she says. \u201cRinse after lunch, maybe, as that will neutralise the acid produced when you eat or drink anything. Mouthwash isn\u2019t necessary unless it\u2019s been prescribed by your dentist, but most people use it for cosmetic reasons.\u201d When should you clean your teeth? Teeth are most vulnerable straight after food or drink. \u201cWhen we eat or drink, any sugars lower the pH level in the mouth, making it acidic. This is what causes dental decay,\u201d says Coates. \u201cIf you brush your teeth too soon [after eating], you could loosen microscopic amounts of loosened enamel from the acid attack. It takes about an hour for that to neutralise.\u201d So, you shouldn\u2019t brush your teeth for at least an hour after eating or drinking anything. \u201cIt\u2019s recommended to brush your teeth last thing at night and at least one other time during the day,\u201d says Coates. \u201cMost people will do this in the morning, although this should be at least 30 minutes before having food or drink or about an hour after.\u201d Should you get braces? \u201cThe NHS criteria for orthodontics is tight so only the worst cases tend to be corrected \u2013 it comes down to function rather than appearance,\u201d says Coates. \u201cThis means you may reach adulthood and become unhappy with the position of the teeth. The option then is to go private, if you can afford it. You can also go private to get braces for your child if they don\u2019t meet the criteria.\u201d How do you counter staining? Highly coloured food that contains tannins such as tea, coffee, red wine, and some curries (not to mention smoking) can stain the teeth. \u201cIf you are going to have something sugary or acidic, it\u2019s better to have it as part of mealtime, as it\u2019s not the amount you have; it\u2019s the frequency,\u201d says Coates. \u201cIf you\u2019re snacking or sipping something sugary, for example, throughout the day, your teeth will potentially be under an acid attack all day. So if you do need to eat or drink between meals, you\u2019re better off drinking water or milk and snacking on nuts, seeds, rice cakes, breadsticks, cheese, vegetables, etc, which are a much safer pH for the teeth.\u201d As well as regular visits to the dentist, a whitening toothpaste can help to keep the staining down. Should you whiten your teeth? Coates explains that at home, you are not going to be able to do much other than removing staining by using a whitening toothpaste, for instance. \u201cThe legal limit for hydrogen peroxide in a product is 0.1%, which isn\u2019t high enough to make a difference to the shade of your teeth. Professional treatment with a dentist is the only legal and reliable route to safe, lasting teeth whitening.\u201d Walmsley also warns that \u201cfad\u201d whitening treatments can sometimes be abrasive and actually damage the teeth. How often should you see your dentist? We\u2019re often told to go to the dentist twice a year, but is this really necessary for everyone? \u201cIt\u2019s only by going to see your dentist that you can determine how often you need to see them,\u201d says Walmsley. \u201cDepending on the state of your teeth, they will decide if you need to see them on a regular basis or have a more personalised plan.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
