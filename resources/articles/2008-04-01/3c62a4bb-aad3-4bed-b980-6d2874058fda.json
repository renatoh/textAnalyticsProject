Sunderland's manager is to monitor the All Blacks in training during the days leading up to their test match against Ireland as part of his Pro Licence coaching qualification. Before completing the blue riband badge now mandatory for Premier League managers, every pro licence candidate must spend some time observing a professional sports team. Most elect to link up with football clubs, frequently in Italy or Spain but, never afraid to be different, Keane has opted to study New Zealand's rugby union side and, in particular, the Haka, or traditional Maori dance, which serves as the famous preamble to their matches. It so intrigues him that Keane has set aside his dislike of long flights - \"I've been booking them this week and I've got about 10 bloody connections,\" he said, only half exaggerating - in order to absorb the All Black mystique. \"Part of the course is to study teams and some of the others on it go to football clubs but I've been at big football clubs at the highest level and played under the best managers for a long time,\" said Keane. \"And I've always been intrigued by watching the All Blacks and by their history and culture - if the Haka doesn't scare you nothing will. \"I will be plugging into their training and the Haka is part of that, I'm intrigued by the whole package, by their fantastic history. I've seen videos and documentaries about the All Blacks but you can't beat being over there yourself. The Haka is a great spectactle and it will be great to see it against Ireland - it's a coincidence that they're playing Ireland, of course.\" Keane is unsure if he will be allowed into the All Blacks' inner sanctums. \"I've been done a big favour by being allowed to go and I'm going to be keeping my head down,\" he said. \"I don't know if I'll be able to be in on team talks and meals but I want to plug into what they're all about.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
