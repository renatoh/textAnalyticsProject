Britain\u2019s No 1 woman, Johanna Konta, brought up on the northern beaches of Sydney but vulnerable to extreme heat in the past, was one of the non-medical casualties, while four others quit through exhaustion, cramping or injury. Konta lost to the sixth seed, Carolina Garcia, 6-2, 6-2 in an hour and a quarter as the afternoon sun battered the exposed Grandstand Court, where Marius Copil had earlier retired against Marin Cilic. He said a \u201cleft-arm strain\u201d caused his withdrawal, although he was limping heavily and appeared spent and distressed. Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, remains the chief threat to the defending champion, Rafael Nadal, after looking out on his feet playing Marton Fucsovics. Against expectations the Serb recovered to see off the determined challenge of the unseeded Hungarian 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-0 in just under three hours on the main court, winning the last 10 games on the spin. He plainly benefited from the 10-minute break the tournament organisers introduced here on Tuesday for the first time, after the third set. \u201cWe both struggled,\u201d Djokovic said immediately afterwards. \u201cTowards the end of three sets I started hitting the ball. Before that it was survival mode.\u201d To the amusement of the crowd and perhaps the bemusement of his wife, he added, \u201cWe both needed that break at the end of the third set. We had two ice baths. We were naked next to each other. It was quite a magnificent feeling, I must say.\u201d Looking ahead to his second-round match against his compatriot Viktor Troicki on Thursday \u2013 expected to be another sweltering day \u2013 he said: \u201cI\u2019m praying to feel better. But you have these kind of days. A lot of players struggled today.\u201d Having reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year and climbed to No 4 in the world, Konta has failed to get past the second round of any of this season\u2019s four majors, tumbling 42 places in the world rankings. She did not blame the conditions, acknowledging her downfall was due solely to her opponent. \u201cIt was bloody hot,\u201d she said. \u201cMy eyes are still burning \u2013 and I wasn\u2019t even out there for very long.\u201d Konta batted aside doubts about her American coach, Michael Joyce. \u201cI feel happy with the relationship that we have. Coming into this year I was in a very unhappy place. The number one job was to get me into a happy place. I feel definitely that we\u2019ve achieved that. We\u2019ll work together as long as we feel it\u2019s mutually beneficial.\u201d The rest of her season reads: Tokyo, Wuhan, Beijing and Moscow. Garcia said courtside: \u201cToday I served very well and I was able to read her serve better than usual but there were a lot of tough games.\u201d Konta, unseeded in a major for the first time since Melbourne in 2016, when she made the semi-finals, hung on as best she could but Garcia was too savvy and sharp. She struck seven aces in a superb serving display that Konta could not match. Konta had reason to be concerned about the conditions, having collapsed here twice, most recently in the second round two years ago when she experienced a spike in her heart rate before recovering to beat the Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova in three sets. Earlier Caroline Wozniacki, one of the fittest players in tennis, found unique inspiration to beat the heat and Sam Stosur: alcohol. \u201cI had the ice towels and used the shade a little bit,\u201d the 28-year-old second seed said standing in the frying pan that is the Arthur Ashe stadium after a 6-3, 6-2 win sent her into the shelter of the locker room and on to round two. \u201cIt helped. But, to be honest with you, I imagine I\u2019m on the beach with a margarita in hand. It was just about trying to think cool thoughts.\u201d Pointing to her fianc\u00e9 in the stands \u2013 the NBA star David Lee, hatless and dressed in a black T-shirt \u2013 Wozniacki observed, \u201cHe should buy a hat.\u201d Stosur said later: \u201cEveryone always talks about how hot Melbourne is, and, \u2018Oh my god, it\u2019s so bad and everything,\u2019 but the US Open\u2019s way worse than Melbourne. \u201cThere are more retirements here but, for some reason, we get the bad rap in Australia.\u201d Kiki Bertens, who beat Kristyna Pliskova 6-0, 7-5, said: \u201cIt\u2019s really warm and it\u2019s tough to play, but I guess that\u2019s the same for everyone.\u201d Latvia\u2019s Jelena Ostapenko, who beat Andrea Petkovic in three sets, agreed. \u201cIt was very humid and also very hot but it was the same for both of us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to deal with it. The 10-minute break [after two sets for women] helped a lot. I went back on court and I broke her serve straight away.\u201d Naomi Osaka, the Japanese 20th seed who grew up in Florida and beat Germany\u2019s Laura Siegemund, 6-3, 6-2 in an hour and 18 minutes, saw it differently. \u201cEveryone was complaining about it. I thought it was pretty decent. Florida summers are way worse,\u201d Osaka said. Petra Kvitova, who beat Yanina Wickmayer in two quick sets, observed: \u201cI tried really hard not to play the third one in this kind of heat. I was pretty lucky to play first. I couldn\u2019t imagine how horrible the heat was [later].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
