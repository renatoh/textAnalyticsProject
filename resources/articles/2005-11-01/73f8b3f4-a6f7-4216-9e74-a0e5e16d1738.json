The company, which was spun out of the former state-owned British Gas, said that its Interconnector pipeline to the continent, which had been almost exclusively used for exports, had from today doubled its import capacity. The exploration and production company dismissed dire warnings from the International Energy Agency that oil prices could soar because of a lack of investment. It said industry predictions of the value of crude had invariably been wrong. The company yesterday announced an extra \u00a3500m of capital spending on its own energy projects this year but also announced plans to hand back \u00a31bn to shareholders. It denied this could be a \"red rag to a bull\" at a time of mounting speculation that the chancellor will impose a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. The group also insisted it was making \"modest\" wholesale gas price increases and should not be blamed for soaring retail prices. Reporting a 44% increase in third quarter profits to \u00a3308m, Frank Chapman, the BG chief executive, said further North Sea taxes would destabilise the sector and result in lower production, tax revenues and employment opportunities. \"Compared to last year the chancellor is receiving \u00a36bn in additional income, so the case for further increases in tax has not been made,\" he said. He also pointed out that it was only six years ago that the oil price was below $10 per barrel. \"Some of our ventures span over 40 years and we will see several cycles of high and low prices,\" he said. Finance director Ashley Almanza said the decision to hand back \u00a31bn to investors was connected with the \u00a3800m of cash after tax it received from the sale of its stake in the Kashagan field, plus other successes. \"It is not red rag to a bull at all,\" he said. He argued that BG would be spending more than \u00a33bn overall on various schemes - although a relatively small amount of that seems to be destined for the North Sea. The company also defended its move to raise wholesale gas prices from last month saying the increase was from 20p to 23p per therm which was both modest and substantially below current spot prices. The company denied it was making \"extravagant profits\" out of gas deliveries in Britain, where it holds 7% of the wholesale market. Much of the increases were driven by the fact that it was having to bring in supplies from further afield as UK supplies dwindled. But Britain's winter supply fears, highlighted recently in CBI warnings to the government, should be eased by an expanded Interconnector pipeline. The link, 25% owned by BG, is now ready to import 16.5bn cubic metres of gas a year, compared with 8.5bn previously. BG and its partners are planning to increase capacity further to 23.5bcm a year by the end of next year. The company also points out it is pressing ahead with schemes to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) to ease British supply fears. The BG boss also questioned the recent statements from the International Energy Agency about looming oil and gas shortages. BG accepted it was right to suggest that companies should invest more but said future demand and supply situations were \"hard to predict.\" The \u00a3308m third-quarter net profit before recurring items was at the bottom range of City forecasts and shares in the firm dipped slightly to 526p. BG's operating profit, excluding one-off items, came in at \u00a3548m while revenues rose 24% to \u00a31.4bn. Oil and gas production rose 4% over the three months to 41.2m barrels of oil equivalents, which was slightly below expectations due to North Sea maintenance programmes. Bruce Evers, oil analyst at Investec Securities, said the figures overall were \"a little disappointing\" although there was a good comeback from the LNG and foreign transmission businesses. As for the \u00a31bn payout to shareholders in the next 12 to 18 months, Mr Evers added: \"It's worrying that they have not got enough projects to invest in.\" Tony Shepard, analyst at Charles Stanley, described the figures as \"strong\" and said the group's market value of \u00a318bn and freedom from debt made it the inevitable focus of takeover speculation. A change of control was dismissed by Frank Chapman. He said questions about takeovers had been made during \"every (financial results) conference call since 1996.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
