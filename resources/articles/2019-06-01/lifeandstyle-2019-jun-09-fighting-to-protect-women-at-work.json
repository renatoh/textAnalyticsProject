This week, world leaders have a crucial chance to answer this call, and turn the wave of global outrage following #MeToo into systemic change for women in the workplace. We call on the UK government not to waste this opportunity to champion a strong global law that protects all women. Governments, employers and workers are meeting in Geneva for the International Labour Conference to negotiate a new global convention to end violence and harassment in the world of work. We urge them to remember the 235 million women around the world who work without any legal protection because one in three countries have no laws against sexual harassment at work. It is the poorest women who are the most vulnerable \u2013 domestic workers, factory workers, those women living hand-to-mouth who cannot afford to risk their jobs by standing up for themselves and for each other. An international law is urgently needed. The UK government must be bold, and use its influence to ensure the convention is not watered down or negotiations derailed. Just as it did in the fight to end modern slavery, it needs to be at the forefront of those calling for the most robust legislation possible. We must end this conference with a strong and inclusive convention that provides protection for every woman, everywhere, from the Hollywood studios to the factory floors of Cambodia and serviced households of Latin America. Because abuse isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s job description.
