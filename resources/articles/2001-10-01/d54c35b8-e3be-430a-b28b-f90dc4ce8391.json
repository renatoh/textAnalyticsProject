Some Tories and even Labour backbenchers were demanding their resignations and it is likely that at least one select committee will mount an inquiry. Downing Street again expressed support for Mr Byers, who, as the Guardian revealed yesterday, forced out his department's director of communications for refusing to take part in a dirty tricks spinning campaign against Bob Kiley, the London transport commissioner. A career civil servant, Alun Evans, was removed when he refused an order from Ms Moore to brief against Mr Kiley. Ms Moore was reprimanded this week for sending an email urging colleagues to rush out embarrassing news within an hour of the second plane crashing into the World Trade Centre. Last night Jonathan Baume, general secretary of the First Division Association, said: \"Whitehall sources tell me this is true. If so, it was wrong and makes it harder for other civil servants to say no. He was treated badly. Special advisers should respect the judgment of civil servants.\" Another Whitehall source said: \"Jo Moore is a goner. It is only a matter of days. The next person to go will be Byers. There is little doubt that they ran the department together. If she is guilty of an error of judgment, he is guilty of fostering the atmosphere in which this horrendous memo was written.\" Mr Kiley, who is at loggerheads with the government over its plans to part-privatise London Underground, said: \"Personal vilification is the last resort of people unable to defend their position or win the argument.\" In August stories suggesting Mr Kiley had surrounded himself with cronies from America, and had exaggerated his success in reviving the New York subway, appeared in national newspapers. Mr Kiley said yesterday: \"I was aware of such stories circulating during the summer. They were inaccurate. It was an attempt to discredit me.\" But Tony Blair's official spokesman insisted that nothing irregular had happened. He said the policy differences between the government and Mr Kiley were well known, and it was perfectly legitimate to point them out. He said: \"Pointing out where we disagree with someone ... does not amount to personal vilification. It is expressing disagreement at a policy level.\" But he pointedly refused to comment on the claim that Alun Evans, communications director of the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions, had been forced out. \"It is on the public record that Alun Evans came from a policy background and has gone back to a very important policy job, after two years at the strategic communications unit in Downing Street and two years at the department,\" he said. Mr Evans is now running the secretariat of the inquiry into the lessons of the foot and mouth crisis. Tam Dalyell, the most senior backbencher in the Commons, said Mr Byers should resign or be sacked by Mr Blair. Tory spokesman Tim Collins attacked the \"politicisation\" of the civil service, pointing out that 17 heads of information had left since 1997. \"The repeated pattern of sidelining those who refuse to carry out inappropriate or partisan instructions remains a very serious matter. It is well past time that Mr Byers appeared in public to justify his behaviour.\" For the Liberal Democrats, Don Foster demanded a Commons inquiry. \"It is outrageous that an experienced civil servant should be removed because he wouldn't dance to a political tune,\" he said. Ms Moore received a further blow when Nick Raynsford, the local government minister, pointedly failed to defend her. His office released the news Ms Moore had suggested be \"buried\" by the tragedy in New York - a humdrum announcement of consultation on changes to councillors' allowances. \"I don't know why she thought it needed to be buried,\" he said, insisting it had been cleared for publication on September 10."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
