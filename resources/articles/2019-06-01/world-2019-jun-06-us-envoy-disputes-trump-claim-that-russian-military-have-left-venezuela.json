Donald Trump tweeted earlier this week that \u201cRussia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from Venezuela\u201d, but the claim was quickly disputed by the Kremlin. Elliott Abrams, who was appointed as special envoy in January, said on Thursday that the Russian role was not as vital to Maduro\u2019s survival as the Cuban military presence, but remained important. And while some specialist forces may have left the country, he said \u201cthe Russians have not abandoned the regime\u201d. \u201cThe Russians are the second greatest outside influence after Cuba. There were, I\u2019d say, a year or two ago, a thousand Russians. Then it was down closer to zero. Then it ticked up again a couple of months ago when about 125 Russians arrived,\u201d Abrams told the Guardian. \u201cSome of them I assume have left because [they] had specific tasks to conduct and would have completed those tasks and left,\u201d Abrams added. \u201cWe believe that one of the things they were doing was repairing air defence systems which had become damaged by the series of blackouts in February. And I think once you do that you don\u2019t need to stay \u2013 you\u2019ve completed the task. So the fact that they would leave does not suggest that the Russians are not helping Maduro.\u201d Russian military advisers flew into Caracas in late March in what has widely seen as a gesture of Kremlin support for the embattled leader in the face of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s challenge to his authority. Guaid\u00f3 is recognised as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim leader by more than 50 countries, including the US, most of Europe and much of Latin America. On 30 April, he declared an uprising to remove Maduro and received emphatic verbal support from the Trump administration, but Guaid\u00f3\u2019s appeal failed to convince the Venezuelan military to switch sides. It is unclear what prompted Trump to claim that \u201cmost\u201d Russians had left Venezuela. The Guardian has learned that the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told his US counterpart that there were 96 Russian military personnel left in Venezuela, but US officials believe there may be up to 150 still in the country. Abrams would not comment on precise numbers but stressed that the Russian presence was considerably smaller than Cuba\u2019s, which he estimated as 2,500, including Maduro\u2019s personal bodyguards. On Tuesday, the US further tightened restrictions on travel to Cuba by US citizens, and Trump has threatened a \u201cfull and complete embargo\u201d on the island if it does not end support for Maduro. Abrams, a veteran hawk on Latin America, argued that, as US sanctions tighten, Cuba may become more dependent on the flow of Venezuelan oil. \u201cThis is not existential for Russia in any way,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cI think Putin is taking advantage of an opportunity that he saw in the western hemisphere. That opportunity may diminish. It may disappear. It\u2019s not that big a deal for Russia. I think they\u2019re much more flexible about the future of Maduro than the Cubans are.\u201d Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, said on Thursday said the west was \u201ccrazy\u201d for supporting Guaid\u00f3. He described the national assembly leader as \u201clikable\u201d but he warned that the world would plunge into chaos if there were no rules. \u201cIf we adopt this way of coming to power \u2013 a man walks into a square, lifts up his eyes to heaven and declares himself president before God \u2013 would this be normal or not?\u201d Putin asked news agencies at an economic forum in St Petersburg. After the failure of the April uprising, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that Maduro had a plane ready to fly him to Cuba, but had been persuaded to stay in power by the Kremlin. In retrospect, Abrams said: \u201cWe will never know whether he would have gone because, on and off, over time, he has very often had a plane fuelled and ready to go.\u201d In off-the-record remarks last week that were leaked to the Washington Post, Pompeo conceded that it was \u201cdevilishly difficult\u201d to keep the Venezuelan opposition factions united. \u201cThe moment Maduro leaves, everybody\u2019s going to raise their hands and [say]: \u2018Take me, I\u2019m the next president of Venezuela.\u2019 It would be forty-plus people who believe they\u2019re the rightful heir to Maduro,\u201d the secretary of state is quoted as saying. Asked about the remarks, Abrams said: \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with a lot of democratic oppositions and they\u2019re all fractious. And the reason they\u2019re fractious is that they\u2019re democratic. \u201cIn my experience, the degree of democracy within a movement or party when it is in opposition is predictive of the degree of democracy when it takes power.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
