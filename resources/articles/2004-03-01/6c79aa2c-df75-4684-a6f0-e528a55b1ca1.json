There, I have said it. Conventional wisdom is that ITV's highlights programme never really recovered from its gimmick-laden beginnings, when it was disastrously scheduled as a kind of football-lite show for the Saturday tea-time Blind Date crowd; but my view is that after emergency surgery the patient was sitting up taking nourishment remarkably quickly, and is currently in the rudest possible health. This, of course, is ironic because there are only 11 matches to go before The Premiership is discreetly carried out of the back door in a box to make way for the return of Match of the Day. Only then will we find out if the general rejoicing - stopping short of church bells, but only just - when the BBC outbid ITV for the rights was justified. At least the current mania for makeovers ensures MOTD will be given something more radical than the usual shampoo and set for next season. Alongside ITV's interloper, MOTD has usually been cast as a much-loved and respected old uncle; but even revered relatives begin to whiff a little if the tweed jacket is not taken to the cleaners once in a while, something I am sure the producers will consider. There are a number of promising younger commentators on BBC radio - Simon Brotherton, John Murray, Ian Dennis and others - who could usefully replenish the old guard, but other changes would be welcome too, if only to refresh the jaded palates of those of us who have been watching soccer highlights since Bobby Charlton had hair. It is true that ITV probably went too far at first in the way of refreshment, but the result has been a pretty enjoyable show. The theme music, for instance, I shall definitely miss. I have greatly enjoyed playing U2 karaoke over the opening titles, and shall lament the passing of It's A Beautiful Day before I have quite managed to capture successfully the soaring vocals on the \"Touch me, Take me to that other place\" bit. I have also been enjoying the florid commentaries of Peter Drury, who sometimes appears to have ingested more back issues of the old Reader's Digest feature Towards More Colourful Speech than can possibly be good for you, but at least is having a go. On Saturday, with the news that Arsenal's new stadium has got the go-ahead, Drury made the famous Highbury clock his leading player, which turned out to be something of a masterstroke when Arsenal scored twice before the iconic timepiece had really got going. \"The clock can't catch up with the team it has watched at this ground for close on a century,\" said Drury in a memorable piece of phrase-making. Later, when Charlton pegged a goal back, Drury announced: \"Down and out at five past three, Charlton are back in it at 20 past four.\" The clock is such a defining feature of the famous old ground Arsenal are shortly to leave that it was almost elegiac to give it such prominence in the commentary. I shall actually miss the adverts as well, which in my region on Saturday included one for something called BABE text. Apparently - and this was information of which I was previously unaware - there were \"red hot women in your area waiting to get raunchy on the phone\". By sending a text to the number specified, I could, the advert assured me, \"have fun with a sexy babe right now\", an offer I might very well have considered had I not been waiting for the highlights of Blackburn against Southampton. I suspect that under the terms of its charter the BBC is not permitted to advertise red-hot babes of its own, so will have to find something else to create a similar frisson. I have no idea what that might be, but I am pretty sure it is not Garth Crooks interviewing David Pleat. I realise there are some weeks to go before The Premiership disappears from our screens so this could be considered a slightly premature tribute, but I wanted to make sure I said something before the programme goes, and I always feel it is such a shame you have to be dead before you get to read your obituaries. One thing I shall not miss from The Premiership, nor from Football Focus, Five Live, Talksport and every other programme on which football is featured, is further discussion of the offside law. To put this endless carping in perspective, consider the case of the Swedish referee Ivan Eklind, who took charge of the semi-final between Austria and the hosts Italy in the 1934 World Cup. Josef Bican, who played for Austria in the match, appeared on an excellent BBC4 documentary, Fascism and Football, repeated on BBC2, and told how he knocked a cracking ball out to his mate Franz Cisar on the right wing, only to see the referee rise and head the ball back to the Italians, one of many outrages contributing to Italy's narrow victory. Turned out the ref had been dining with Mussolini the night before. Il Duce personally selected the same referee for the final, and Italy duly won the tournament. Mussolini, like Hitler and Franco, none of whom was at all interested in football, nevertheless knew the game was the opium of the masses (except in pre-revolutionary China, where opium was, in fact, the opium of the masses) and used it shamelessly. The message is clear. If Europe ever again finds itself in the grip of fascist dictators, serious thought is going to have to be given to refereeing standards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
