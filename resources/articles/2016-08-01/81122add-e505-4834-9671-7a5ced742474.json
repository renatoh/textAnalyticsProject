The study by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) found that professional employment rates of students graduating in 2011 were as much as nine percentage points lower for black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani graduates than for white graduates. The analysis found smaller but persistent gaps between male and female graduates, with 79% of men in professional occupations or study, compared with 74% of women, even though more women were in jobs overall. Substantial gaps were also seen among graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds compared with those from better-off areas, suggesting that an effort to widen access to professional occupations such as law and accounting still has a long way to go. The single minority ethnic group that saw its prospects brighten was that of ethnic Chinese graduates, whose professional employment rates improved compared with a similar survey in 2009, and whose 2011 cohort enjoyed employment rates similar to those of their white peers. Prof Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education watchdog, said the Hefce report \u201chighlights the shocking gaps in outcomes for various groups of students \u2026 We know that students from most black and minority ethnic groups and those from disadvantaged areas face [the] worst outcomes,\u201d Ebdon said. \u201cThis remains the case even when accounting for factors such as entry qualifications, which might affect your future prospects.\u201d Forty months after graduation, the total proportion of graduates who were employed or in further study was more than 95%, and for both cohorts 69% were in white-collar professional roles. While the differences in overall employment rates between white graduates and those from minority groups narrowed between 2009 and 2011, the gaps in rates of professional employment did not improve. Hefce\u2019s analysis also made predictions of professional employment based on qualifications, and found that black and ethnic Pakistani graduates had the biggest gap between forecast employment rates and outcome. \u201cThe report supports previous Hefce analysis in demonstrating that there continues to be serious challenges to achieving equality of outcomes for graduates from ethnic minority groups, graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds and women, particularly in terms of securing professional employment,\u201d said Christopher Millward, Hefce\u2019s director of policy. \u201cHigher education can be a powerful force for social mobility but this requires not just access to and success within university. It also requires successful transition into rewarding careers. This report demonstrates the imperative for higher education providers to work with employers to address this.\u201d Hefce\u2019s new report updates previous analysis by examining the employment outcomes of UK-based students who qualified from a full-time first degree course at an English university in 2011. Ebdon said universities were trying to address what he described as \u201cunexplained outcomes gaps,\u201d with universities pledged to use \u00a355m from tuition fee income next year to support disadvantaged students for life after graduation. \u201cUniversities, government and employers should continue to work together to tackle these problems,\u201d Ebdon said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
