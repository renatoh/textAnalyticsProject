Views beyond were fleeting and blurred, and walking anywhere was more of an internal journey - a myopia of misty forms and blunted sound. So it was the small, unexpected things that rose from the immediate, half- imagined ground that became significant: a mixed group of blue-tits and coal-tits working through elder trees; a green and black caterpillar with pale tufts like toothbrushes under a lime; the disembodied call of owls lost in fog. Walking across a field, greening already with a winter cereal crop, I startled a bird which rose with rapid wingbeats a few yards ahead. It was a peregrine falcon and it zoomed past me silently in the mist, ready to seek out its next quarries. The spot it flew from was a puddle of cloud-grey feathers and the gory remains of a pigeon the peregrine had been feeding on. The intensity of fresh blood held a magical red in the grey-green monochrome of the landscape. A few yards away was another circle of feathers, and another beyond that. The peregrine had developed a successful system of intercepting pigeons as they flew from trees into the open field - at least, it had until I came blundering through the fog and messed it up. Although I love these foggy autumn days, when they clear it makes the landscape even more vibrant. From a distance, on a fine bright morning, the grove of cherry trees in steep woods has a fiery intensity - the sacrificial signal of fresh blood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
