It brings together numerous accounts of the last voyages of Thomas Cavendish in 1591-13, Henry Hudson in 1610-11 and Sir Walter Raleigh in 1617-18. As Edwards points out, this sort of material (as collected by Hakluyt and Purchas) used to be part of \"English Literature\", but fell from fav-our as the empire broke up, and under the influence of the New Criticism. Most of it is hardly to be called literature in any exalted sense of the word. But it takes its character from its function. Just as a secret journal, such as Pepys's, written in shorthand, and therefore illegible to most of his contemporaries, differs from Evelyn's, which was aimed at his family and descendants, so Raleigh's journal of his last voyage differs from his letter to key members of court, or his letter to his wife, or his general \"Apology\" justifying his actions, or his final plea to the king. The same events are covered. The rhetoric changes, until finally all hope is lost. The condemned man is only concerned to make a good and honourable end. He asks for the axe, saying \"I pray thee let me see it; dost thou think that I am afraid of it?\" He lets his hand run along the edge of the blade, and remarks to the sheriff with a smile, \"This is a sharp medicine, but it is a physician for all diseases.\" Placing his head on the block, he continues, \"So the heart be right, it is no matter which way the head lieth.\" Then he forgives the headsman and is killed. These early explorers, according to Edwards, considered the act of writing to be an indispensable part of making voyages. Hudson, seeking a northern route to China, took with him Henry Greene, a man who \"by his lewd life and conversation ... had lost the good will of all his friends\" but was valued \"because he could write well\". This same Greene organised the mutiny whereby Hudson and several sick men were put into a shallop and set loose, when hunger and a fear of Hudson's obsessive nature provoked a rebellion. The main account of this voyage is by Abacuck Pricket, and it is awesome material, as the men realise to their terror that they are going to get stuck in the Arctic winter, and as they try hunting polar bears among the ice-floes, \"there hung upon the easternmost point many islands of floating ice, and a bear on one of them which from one to another came towards us till she was ready to come aboard. But when she saw us look at her, she cast her head between her hinder legs and then dived under the ice; and so from one piece to another till she was out of our reach.\" Even when they find signs of human habitation on land, the effect is unsettling: \"We saw some round hills of stone like grass-cocks, which at the first I took to be the work of some Christian ... And being night then, I turned off the uppermost stone and found them hollow within, and full of fowls hanged by their necks.\" Something about this Inuit cold storage system (in the absence of any humans) comes as a horrible surprise. The account of the mutiny is a mixture of the informative and the frustrating. We are told exactly where on the ship, the Discovery, all the men are sleeping, and how the mutiny unfolds: clearly a part of the interest is in apportioning blame, when the case came to court (which it finally did, though Pricket was acquitted). But the editor warns the reader about the useless and deadening amount of detail regarding changes of course. He says: \"These confused and confusing details should be borne with because in their way they are quite eloquent of the bewilderment, anxiety and frustration of the company as the ship twisted and turned in uncharted waters, trying to free herself from ice, looking for the opening that would lead to warm seas and the spice islands.\" It is an important point. Fiction would have seen to it that we understood it more clearly. The mutineers are in Hudson Bay, but, when an Inuit with a knife attacks Pricket, he thinks the man's weapon is of a type they use in Java. He must have believed the Spice Islands to be not so far away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
