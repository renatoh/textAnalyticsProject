Mr Livingstone announced he was pressing ahead with the increase on July 4, despite overwhelming opposition in a consultation. He admitted that 75% of public respondents opposed the rise, as did \"the great majority\" of organisations, businesses and stakeholders - including many of his staunchest allies in introducing the charge two years ago. But he claimed that the increase would \"build upon success, cutting congestion even further and raising more revenue to be invested in London's transport system\". Critics suggested that Mr Livingstone was losing sight of the charge's original purpose of cutting traffic jams in favour of using it as a device to boost his coffers. Mr Livingstone pointed out that fares for buses, trains and tubes were also rising faster than the rate of inflation. He said improvements to London's public transport network were \"dependent on the availability of sufficient funding\". In an attempt to make life easier for those who have no choice but to drive into the city centre, there will be a 15% discount for paying annually or monthly. Freight operators with fleets of vehicles will only pay \u00a37. Jo Valentine, the chief executive of the business lobbying group London First, said a rise was unacceptable without measures to ease the \"hassle\" of paying, which deterred many shoppers. She pointed out that traffic had fallen by 15% in the two years since the charge's introduction and said most of those still driving into the city regularly were \"people who haven't got any option\". The Conservatives accused the mayor of showing \"contempt\" for the legally required process of public consultation. Angie Bray, the Tories' spokeswoman in the London assembly, said: \"The mayor has shed almost all of his friends on this. It's very noticeable that his cheerleaders have swapped camps very publicly.\" Mr Livingstone has indicated that he is also likely to override negative consultations and press ahead with a tram scheme through west London and a widening of the congestion charging zone to Kensington and Chelsea. The congestion charge was originally seen as a blueprint for other cities to follow. But Edinburgh voters have turned down a similar charge in a referendum and few other local authorities appear willing to take the risk. Tony Travers, the head of the London group at the London School of Economics, said: \"It's becoming more and more obvious that the charge will be an oddity unique to London. \"Clearly, Ken feels hugely wedded to it - he's very comfortable with it and at the end of the day, he needs the money.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
