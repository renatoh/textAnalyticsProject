They are among four constructions built between the 1950s and 1980s \u2013 the last is a slightly less forbidding Mies van der Rohe-inspired steel and glass home \u2013 given Grade II or II* status on Friday by the government. The news coincides with Brutal and Beautiful, a new exhibition by English Heritage, which advised on the listings, examining the nation's attitude to our recent architectural past. The earliest of the buildings is the 1954-built Gravesend Civil Defence Bunker in Kent. It was in use until 1968 and its 35 staff would have formed a command centre in the event of a Soviet air attack. Now restored and open to the public, it has been protected at Grade II more for its rarity as a surviving artefact of the era than for any particular aesthetic merit. In contrast, the unforgiving concrete slats and battleship-prowed austere grandeur of the substation on Moore Street in central Sheffield, while ugly to some, was the reason for its Grade II listing rather than the building's utility. English Heritage argued that its brutalist lines were a key symbol of the city's postwar reconstruction. Another example, the vast, newly revamped Park Hill housing estate, was listed in 1998 in an early, highly controversial mark of official approval for the genre. And while it might sound anomalous for a warehouse in Swindon to be handed the even more cherished II* listing, this one has the rare mark of being designed by Sir Norman Foster. Built in 1980 for Renault, the glass walls and exposed lattice of supporting poles and cables were distinctive enough to feature five years later in the James Bond film A View to a Kill. In contrast, the final new listing, also given a II* rating, is by modernist standards almost soothingly familiar. Capel Manor House in Horsmonden, Kent, designed by Michael Manser in 1971, is a particularly elegant example of the sort of glass-fronted rectangular box currently preferred by high-end criminals in BBC1 crime series. The final decision of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport was to push up from Grade II to II* the Catholic Church of English Martyrs in Wallasey, near Birkenhead, built in 1952 in a distinctive modern-meets-traditional style. While the listing of postwar buildings is fairly long-established \u2013 the first was the Bracken House office block in London in 1987 \u2013 only 690 have thus far been chosen, less than 0.2% of the entire register. It remains a controversial area, said Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage: \"Few areas of English Heritage's work are as disputed or as intriguing as the listing of modern heritage and these striking buildings listed today exemplify our rigorous and highly selective approach. Some still view the buildings of the era as concrete monstrosities; others as fine landmarks in the history of building design.\" \u2022 Brutal and Beautiful is on at English Heritage's Quadriga gallery in Wellington Arch, central London, from 25 September to 3 November \u2022 This article was amended on 24 September 2013 to clarify the location of Wallasey."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
