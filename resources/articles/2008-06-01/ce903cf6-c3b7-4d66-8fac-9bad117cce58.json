Of course, cabernet sauvignon is bought all the time as a varietal (that is, a wine made principally from that grape and with its name on the label), mostly at the budget end of things - wine as fuel - where it packs flavour and fight into a bottle in equal quantities. It's a thick-skinned grape (literally, not metaphorically, which means it's quite tannic) that ripens relatively late. In cooler climates, or if picked before fully ripe, the wine it makes will often take on crunchy, green flavours likened to the smell of green capsicums or dubbed \"herbaceous\". At the other end of the scale, if the grapes are over-ripe, the wine can taste like stewed berries, fluid and pungent and denuded of structure. And even when it is right, unblended, there's something about the structure of its taste that subconsciously puts me off: it makes me think of a Lego brick, all overly-neat corners, just sitting around waiting to be bolted on to a bit of something else to make it seem more interesting (as it is in classic bordeaux). Probably this is the effect of having drunk too many budget cabernet sauvignons that were all right but not that great. Well, it's time to get over that. There are some very good examples around. Apart from those below, look out for ones from Margaret River in Western Australia, where the style is super-powered cru bourgeois, and for cab sav ros\u00e9s, which are crunchy, bright and fabulous with barbecued burgers. Vi\u00f1a Ulmo Cabernet Sauvignon 2007, Chile \u00a33.79, Marks &amp; Spencer; 13.5% abv Extraordinary to pull off such a good wine for the price, if you remove the duty, of a carton of Tropicana. This is rounded, juicy, bouncy and could be served either slightly chilled or at room temperature. Drink with Good for barbecues because it straddles the need for high-impact flavour and gluggability Domino de Plata Cabernet Sauvignon 2006, Argentina \u00a37.49, Marks &amp; Spencer; 14% abv A beautiful, soft but not saggy wine that makes the most of cabernet's classic 'blackcurrant smeared with eucalyptus' character. Imagine putting a pan of blackcurrants on the stove and, as they begin to warm, you get a lovely, intense, smell - well, here that's woven in with oak, plus a dash of malbec and merlot to fill it out. Drink with Beef rubbed with fragrant herbs - bay, rosemary, thyme Taste The Difference Coonawarra Cabernet 2005, Australia \u00a37.99, Sainsbury's; 14% abv This famous strip of 'terra rossa' in South Australia produces superb cabernet sauvignon. This one, made for Sainsbury's by Katnook, is quite an arid style, closely-knit, with a profound sense of place, gravelly authority and intellectual mas. Drink with Rib-eye steak with black pepper Ch\u00e2teau Cambon La Pelouse 2005 Haut M\u00e9doc Cru Bourgeois Sup\u00e9rieur, France \u00a317.99, Waitrose; 13.5% abv A single sniff of this wine from the much-lauded 2005 vintage presses all the 'ah, bordeaux' buttons - and sadly you can't say that often. I've included it here as an example of how cabernet sauvignon can work in a blend (this is 50% merlot, 30% cabernet sauvignon, with cabernet franc and petit verdot, too). And it will improve for another handful of years. Drink with Roast rib of beef"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
