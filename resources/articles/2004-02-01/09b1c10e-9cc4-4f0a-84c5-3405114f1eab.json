Hearts might have won it but for a fine save by Daniel Andersson, who touched a Paul Hartley free-kick on to the post after 70 minutes. Scott Brown, Jarkko Wiss and Murdock of Hibs were booked after 13, 16 and 51 minutes with the first and last lucky not to be sent off for nasty fouls. The same could also have been said of Hearts' Patrick Kisnorbo and Hartley, who were fortunate to have been shown merely yellow cards. Alan Maybury escaped all punishment for an apparent off-the-ball punch at Brown but may find Levein, or even the SFA's video review panel, dispensing justice later. \"I'm disappointed that none of the three officials saw the incident between Maybury and Brown,\" the Hibernian manager Bobby Williamson said. \"But it's not up to me what happens next.\" Levein best summed up an entertaining if seldom vintage match when he added: \"No one expected a classic - and we didn't get one.\" Man of the match : Steven Pressley (Hearts)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
