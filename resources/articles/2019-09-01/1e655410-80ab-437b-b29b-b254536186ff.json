The manager, who had wanted to strengthen in Laporte\u2019s position before the start of the season, described the loss of his defensive linchpin as hard. \u201cIt will be long \u2013 five or six months, January or February maybe \u2013 next year for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cMy advice to you is not to write too many names about the winter window, because you are going to make a mistake. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. I heard already we are interested in this player or the other player. I would like to say to all the clubs in the world: \u2018Don\u2019t be nervous, because we are not interested in any players or central defenders in Europe.\u2019 \u201cWe are going to survive with the players we have. Maybe in December we are going to start to think about it \u2013 maybe. But we could not invest in this situation in the summer, we cannot do it in winter. That\u2019s why we are going to wait with the players we have, with the two central defenders [John Stones and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi], with Fernandinho, with Eric Garc\u00eda and Taylor Harwood-Bellis, even some players in different positions we can use there. We\u2019re going to move forward.\u201d Of what City will miss because of Laporte\u2019s absence, Guardiola said: \u201cIt is hard, the same as Leroy [San\u00e9, also out until the new year]. We are disappointed for him, for both of them. Leroy is important. Aymeric in that position is important too, for his left foot and his personality. \u201cUnfortunately he is injured. So we\u2019re going to live without him for a long time, and we have enough resources to move forward and see what we can do.\u201d Stones has not always impressed under the manager, yet Guardiola said: \u201cHe\u2019s going to play incredible this period, while Laporte is not with us. I don\u2019t have any doubts about his quality. The same case like Nico [Otamendi]. And I\u2019m pretty sure the [same regarding the] young players, from what I know from pre-season with Taylor and especially Eric. I know him a little bit more; he played the Carabao Cup last season. Fernandinho with his quality can play there. \u201cThe personality [of Stones] is always there. So there\u2019s a guy who in the first season made some mistakes and always tries again. The only problem is sometimes I decide for Nico and sometimes Vinnie [Kompany, last season]. They have to compete with each other but the quality is there. I know the qualities [of all my players] after three seasons or a little bit more. So I don\u2019t have any doubts \u2013 John included.\u201d Guardiola is confident Stones and Otamendi can be a successful partnership. \u201cBefore Aymeric came they were a partnership and they played many games,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
