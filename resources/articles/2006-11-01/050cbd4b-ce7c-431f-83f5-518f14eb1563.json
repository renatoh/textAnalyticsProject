My schoolfriend Paula and I used to travel in her orange bug. The only thing that worked on the dashboard was the stereo (lucky, because you had to turn the volume right up before Morrissey's wailing drowned out that of the engine), the suspension was so bad that it felt like your intestines had pins and needles after a lengthy drive, and the intense smell of petrol meant that we only ever smoked with our heads stuck out the windows. It was cold, uncomfortable and daft, but then being committed to style rather than content often is. So I felt oddly miffed when Beetle production started again in 1998. It was cheating, surely, to rework that cute little design icon for drivers who wanted the look without any of the misery of repair bills. Luckily, when I was faced with a charcoal grey Beetle Cabriolet, my principles went out of the window (well, the windows are so easy to operate, you see, with that central one-touch mechanism; and it's brilliant the way you can make all four wind down into the doorframe when you put the roof down ...). Yes, the car's more rounded, more comfortable and a little smug, but these days, frankly, so am I. My weekend with the car was my first wedding anniversary. My husband, Johnny, and I were off to a friend's wedding in Stroud and a stay in a posh hotel. On the drive down we found the car's design as tricky as the original's: the curved bonnet and extended dashboard are bad enough, but the Cabriolet's rear screen (which may be glass and heated, but is still tiny) makes it feel as if you're driving a rubber dingy while wearing a balaclava; it did little for my motoring confidence. But it was reassuring that my first row of my second year of marriage was over a CD player rather than anything more existential. The Cabriolet has a rather unnecessary two, one of them an armrest-mounted six CD autochanger. We couldn't make either of them work. Other than that, there was little to bicker about. For such a dinky machine it had real power. My eyes had glazed when Johnny tried to explain what turbo meant, but the idea of fuel injection acting like MSG in a Chinese meal suddenly made sense on the M4. And the Beetle wasn't just nippy, it was also pretty. So pretty, in fact, that it was spontaneously admired by my 70-year-old father-in-law, a four-year-old bridesmaid and a teenage hotel porter in just one day. Back in London, we took our friend Niru out for a drive with the top down (the roof mechanism required some grappling). Niru leant forward from the back seat and muttered in my ear, 'Everyone's watching, they think you're a tosser in this car.' He was right: pedestrians' gazes slid enviously down the Cabriolet's shape. Did they think we were tossers? Probably. But just as I was prepared to suffer for its predecessor, I'm prepared to suffer now, in a different way, for the new, smug, but rather marvellous VW Beetle. \u00b7 Martin Love returns next week"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
