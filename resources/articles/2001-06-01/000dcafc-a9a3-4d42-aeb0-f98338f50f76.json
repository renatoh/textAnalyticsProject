Ginger Snaps is a Canadian feature about two intensely close teenage sisters, Brigitte and Ginger, played by Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle. They are bored as hell in their dull suburban town, which starts being threatened by a werewolf just as their slightly weird mom - Mimi Rogers - is worrying about them not getting their periods yet. In the end, it pans out as a stock teen scary movie. But it's worth seeing for the first reel, which is brilliant, as Brigitte and Ginger prepare a grotesque installation-style series of photos showing their own violent death for a class project. It's all downhill from there, but there is something efficiently creepy about the enclosed world of two alienated young women in suburbia, and it whets your appetite for the similar riff in Terry Zwigoff's forthcoming Ghost World."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
