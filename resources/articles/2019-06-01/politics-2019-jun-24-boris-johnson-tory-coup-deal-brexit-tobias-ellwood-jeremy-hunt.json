Tobias Ellwood, the junior defence minister, said it was possible that the decision by Johnson actively to seek no deal could push some Conservatives to support a no-confidence motion against his government. \u201cI believe that absolutely is the case,\u201d Ellwood told the BBC. \u201cI think a dozen or so members of parliament would be on our side, would be voting against supporting a no deal and that would include ministers as well as backbenchers.\u201d Following a hugely difficult weekend for the Johnson campaign, dominated by questions about why police were called to his home after an argument with his partner, Carrie Symonds, allies of the former foreign secretary sought to fight his corner. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who supported Johnson after abandoning his own leadership bid, said it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to accuse the frontrunner of avoiding scrutiny, saying he was taking part in dozens of Conservative hustings events. Priti Patel, the former international development secretary and another leading Johnson supporter, told the BBC that Johnson was facing \u201ca very clear, politically motivated series of attacks\u201d over the incident on Thursday night at the London home he shares with Symonds. Johnson has refused to comment on the circumstances of a furious row that led one neighbour to record some of the shouting from inside his flat, and informed the Guardian about the incident. Other neighbours said they had considered calling police. \u201cThe very prospect of someone taping someone in their private home, frankly, tells me that is politically motivated,\u201d Patel said. \u201cAnd that is not the type of behaviour that you would expect in our country. It\u2019s the type of behaviour associated with the old Eastern Bloc.\u201d Patel said such incidents were \u201cvery much there to deflect upon the fact he is a Brexit candidate\u201d. She said: \u201cQuite frankly this has now become very much, I think, remain versus leave, and a personal attack and campaign against Boris.\u201d Speaking earlier to Sky News, Hunt declined to comment on the incident with Symonds, saying only: \u201cHe\u2019s got to decide what he says about his private life.\u201d But Hunt was scathing about Johnson\u2019s decision to avoid almost all media interviews and debates, calling it \u201cvery disrespectful to Conservative party members\u201d. Johnson has agreed to take part in an ITV event on 9 July, by which point party members will have received their ballots. But he is avoiding a planned Sky debate on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m saying that it is cowardice, frankly, not to appear in head-to-head debates against me,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cYou can\u2019t become prime minister without answering questions about the decisions you\u2019re going to have to take almost immediately you get through the door of No 10. My worry is that Boris has got a coalition of people like Matt Hancock, who want no deal taken off the table, and Mark Francois, who wants no deal \u2013 that coalition will dissolve very, very quickly indeed when he has to take some actual decisions. \u201cSometimes in politics you can fudge, but on Brexit you can\u2019t. There are going to have to be decisions, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s very important that the new prime minister has a mandate from having spelled out exactly what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d Hunt also accused Johnson of appearing willing to \u201cslink through the back door\u201d of No 10 by \u201cpathetically\u201d evading questioning. \u201cDon\u2019t be a coward, Boris, man up,\u201d he wrote in Monday\u2019s edition of the Times. Warnings such as those from Ellwood about no-confidence motions made proper scrutiny all the more necessary, Hunt argued: \u201cIn that situation, is he going to have an election in order to get a majority in parliament for a no-deal Brexit? I think Conservative party members need to know the answer to those questions.\u201d Defending Johnson on BBC1\u2019s Breakfast, Hancock said the dozen-plus party hustings and other events amounted to \u201cendless and constant scrutiny\u201d. Hancock added: \u201cOf course, the question of whether Boris\u2019s private life is private is, perfectly reasonably, up to him. I don\u2019t think anybody would like their conversations late at night to be listened in to and snooped on by a neighbour.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
