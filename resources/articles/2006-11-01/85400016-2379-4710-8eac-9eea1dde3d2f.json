A portable DVD player, no less. Why in the age of downloads would I want one of those? Yes, YouTube might have 40% of the video-sharing market, 35 trillion page impressions a month, be beating rivals such as Revver, Metacafe, Break.com and Guba hands down, with plans for a mobile service blah blah blah. But, just occasionally, it's good to step back from the digital hurly-burly. It can bring its own rewards. Like being instantly ostracised by your mates? Why do I bother? Bear in mind that there are big pitfalls with a lot of digital must-haves. They're either thrown together so that they can be sold at an affordable price - and therefore fall apart after about a month - or they become so ubiquitous, like the iPod or Motorola Razr, that sooner or later nobody wants to be seen dead with one. So the VP-110 might be a bit old-school but what's wrong with that? Go on then. Forget, for just a minute, your Zune or - pricey - PS3 and instead marvel at this Japanese wonder - a stylish and svelte DVD player that looks good enough to eat. And so it should at a typical price of \u00a3600. What's so good? It has a stylish, bamboo cover, a 10-inch display, Dolby Digital sound, touch-screen operation and a built-in SD card; it plays almost anything from bog-standard DVDs and MP3s to Divx; it's PAL and NTSC-compliant, you can also download your pictures to show off to your friends. What's the catch? Stuck on a 14-hour flight to Johannesburg, you'll only have hit Cannes before the battery runs out. But then, if you can afford one, you'll most likely be turning left rather than right when you board so seat-side power should keep you going. When can I get one? Got an Osaka postcode or live in the foothills of the Tateyama mountains? Then you can get one about now. Live anywhere else and it's wait and see I'm afraid. Should give you time to save up though."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
