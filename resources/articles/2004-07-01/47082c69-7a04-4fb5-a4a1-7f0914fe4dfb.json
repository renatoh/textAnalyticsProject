The Blues have already played Celtic as part of the Champions World Series, and also face Roma and then AC Milan before returning to England ahead of their kick-off to the new domestic season at Stamford Bridge on August 15. Chelsea's summer signings seem to be settling in well under new manager Jose Mourinho, as he looks to make his mark at the Stamford Bridge club. With the capture of Portugal centre-back Ricardo Carvalho earlier this week, the west London club's close season spending was brought to an end. Mourinho is now content with his 24-strong party as he prepares for a sustained assault on both domestic and European honours. Lampard, given extra time off following Euro 2004, believes the signs are all positive ahead of the new campaign. The ex-Porto manager certainly seems to have brought varied techniques and idea to the club. \"The training has changed, the organisation off the pitch has changed, the personnel has changed too, it has a freshness about it,\" reflected Lampard on Chelsea TV. \"Last year with so many different players it was hard to adjust in a way. This year it seems to have been more comfortable. \"There is a good team spirit and a core of young, hungry players that want to train hard and want to win things. You can feel that even though I have only been back a week or so. \"We did a lot of running last season, and it got us fit, but this is a different style and I think everyone is enjoying it, working very hard and without doubt we will be ready come Manchester United.\" Record signing Didier Drogba is set for his first run out in a Chelsea shirt against Roma tonight in Pittsburgh, where Republic of Ireland winger Damien Duff could feature following his absence with a shoulder problem. Goalkeeper Petr Cech is pencilled in for a full 90 minutes, while defender Robert Huth is missing through a minor injury. Carvalho now linked up with the rest of the Chelsea squad after being accompanied to the United States by chief executive Peter Kenyon following the completion of his \u00a319.85million transfer on a three-year deal from Porto. The 26-year-old has already spelt out his desire to win further trophies having been reunited with his former manager at Stamford Bridge, and Mourinho is delighted to have secured the capture of another top-class international. \"We thought about many, many solutions, we analysed many players,\" Mourinho said on the club's official website. \"We arrived at the conclusion that Ricardo was a perfect choice in terms of football qualities, perfect age, perfect experience, a lot of ambition, and I would say a cheap player in terms of salaries, an expensive player for the transfer fee. Mourinho is confident that his side has developed in the right areas and believes, as Lampard does that Chelsea is ready for the new season. \"I'm really happy with John Terry, [William] Gallas and Robert [Huth] - Robert's development over the last few weeks is very good, I can help him I think to do better day after day - and now we're ready to play 50, 60 matches.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
