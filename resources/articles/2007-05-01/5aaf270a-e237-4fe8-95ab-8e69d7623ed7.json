This is a hugely important season for British athletics. I have to use that term to avoid confusion with the governing body, UK Athletics, although the same applies to it. Under new management it will be hoping that this season provides more than just a sprinkling of promising names for the future. It needs medals even more than the athletes. To a young developing athlete, he or she may view Beijing next year as a stepping stone to great things beyond but for UK Athletics and the sport there is a pressing need for one or two names to emerge quickly as genuine medal hopes for this season and 2008. Glasgow hosts the first televised domestic meet this Sunday with many of our top names on show against tough overseas opposition. Three weeks later men's and women's teams compete in separate European Cup competitions. The women are looking to regain top-flight status by winning promotion in Finland while the men could be fighting off relegation in Munich. By the end of June it will be reasonably clear what sort of season we are likely to have. The early signs have been mixed with the scales tipping slightly towards the negative. Marilyn Okoro gained a great opening win in Hengelo at the weekend over 800 metres which is an event where our strength and depth is so good that you would not bet against one of them repeating Becky Lyne's medal-winning performance of last year. Goldie Sayers produced an eye-catching British record in the javelin of 65.05m which puts her into medal contention if that performance can be repeated. It is a pity though that she cannot pass on some help to Kelly Sotherton who embarrassed herself and her javelin coach, Mick Hill, once again this weekend. While Carolina Kluft continues to dominate the heptathlon at every turn Sotherton once again produced a lame throw in her sixth event at G\u00f6tzis in Austria on Sunday. Jessica Ennis now appears to have the upper hand as the two of them prepare for the world championships in Osaka in August. But one of them needs to find a way to gain respectable points in the javelin otherwise they will both remain empty-handed. Injury clouds hang over other contenders from Paula Radcliffe down. Tim Benjamin's comeback was excitedly awaited by his new coach, Colin Jackson, and the rest of us. By all accounts the man who looked genuinely progressive in 2005 was revelling under the charge of Colin but a complication from treatment to a persistent back problem has ruled him out of his season's opener in Belgrade tonight. We had hoped to see him race Xavier Carter in Glasgow on Sunday but that now too looks doubtful. Add long-jump medallist Greg Rutherford to the list and interrupted training for Becky Lyne along with pretty average early-season runs from some of our sprinters and it would be easy to start letting a general feeling of malaise creep into the whole atmosphere around the team. That is why I think the next two or three weeks are highly significant. Nicola Sanders, Mo Farah, Philips Idowu, Jo Pavey are established stars who would help lift the whole sport if one or two strong early season performances can be found. There are encouraging signs from the younger ranks also that someone somewhere can take the big step that Sayers took two weeks ago. In the same meet Abbey Westley shattered her personal best in the 1500m. She won't be 20 until July and by running 4min 8.74sec she may not have set the world alight but such was the margin of improvement that at the age of 19 she can only look forward to more of the same. Individually the athletes can only do what they can but collectively the sport needs lots of performances like Westley's and sooner rather than later. A little bit of sunshine in Glasgow on Sunday would be the order of the day both literally and metaphorically otherwise the storm clouds will continue to gather over athletics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
