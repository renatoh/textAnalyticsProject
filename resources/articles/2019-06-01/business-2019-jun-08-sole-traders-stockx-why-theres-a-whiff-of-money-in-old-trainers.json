Mercifully, the shoe has never been worn. Miller is getting notes of leather and suede but can probably smell money too. The sought-after Nike Jordan 1s \u2013 designed by the rapper Travis Scott - are among the most coveted on StockX, a fast-growing stock exchange-style trading platform for \u201csneakerheads\u201d, who collect or trade trainers and are willing to pay in excess of \u00a31,000 for a pair. \u201cI blindfold test all the time,\u201d says Miller, who is one of the site\u2019s London-based staff tasked with weeding out fakes in the global trainer (or sneaker, for the Americans) resale market, which is now estimated to be worth as much as $7bn (\u00a35.5bn) a year. \u201cYou look for general quality of sneaker, the stitching, the smell. I tell my best authenticators to close their eyes and tell me what shoe it is. Every sneaker has a unique smell.\u201d At a time when many traditional fashion retailers are struggling to appeal to fickle young shoppers, the major sports brands have struck gold by teaming up with tastemakers such as Pharrell Williams and Kanye West to release limited-edition footwear collections. West\u2019s latest Yeezy shoes are so sought after that British shoppers were queuing in the early hours of Friday to get their hands on the latest iteration, which cost \u00a3180. With demand outstripping supply for these highly prized products, StockX bills itself as a \u201cstock market for things\u201d, enabling individuals to speculate on the most sought after shoes \u2013 and hoodies too \u2013 as if they are shares in a quoted company. The site\u2019s users, who are predominantly male and in their teens and twenties, have traded $1bn worth of unworn gear in the past year. The UK market is worth \u00a3200m. \u201cA stock market is the most efficient way to create a market price for any asset,\u201d says Josh Luber, a former IBM consultant who co-founded StockX with US billionaire Dan Gilbert four years ago. \u201cWe have brought the efficiency and transparency [of that model] to make it easier to buy products where supply and demand is constrained.\u201d The sneakerhead scene used to be a subculture but the internet and sites such as Instagram have forced it into the mainstream as the fashion and music worlds collide with huge social media audiences online. At the same time there has been a shift towards casual dressing across generations, with the athleisure trend last week helping to propel JD Sports Fashion into the FTSE 100 index of top UK companies. \u201cThe growth that we see today is down to the arrival of Instagram,\u201d says Luber. \u201cAll sneakerheads ever wanted to do was show off their shoes and see what other people are wearing. Brands are bringing in fashion designers and artists to make shoes: Kaws [the American artist and designer Brian Donnelly] does shoes with Nike so it crosses many different parts of culture.\u201d There are no profit warnings on StockX but market forces still apply as celebrity stock rises and fall. Justin Timberlake gave the price of Air Jordan 3s a boost when he wore them to the Superbowl but the personal travails of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo made his Nikes hard to shift for a while. Detroit-based StockX\u2019s financial backers include Gilbert, owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, and GV, the venture capital arm of Google owner Alphabet. It also has a string of celebrity investors including Marshall Mathers, better-known as Eminem, Mark Wahlberg and the supermodel Karlie Kloss. So far it has raked in $50m to fund expansion \u2013 Luber says more fundraising rounds will follow. StockX is currently focused on expansion in Europe; it recently opened an office in London as well as the region\u2019s first authentication centre, to ensure the products being sold are genuine, on a west London industrial estate. \u201cLondon is the centre of the European sneaker world \u2026 as a marketplace we have to make it a local experience and get the product to people fast,\u201d says Luber, who with his combat trousers and orange-soled trainers looks dressed for a rap battle rather than meetings with City suits. The 41-year-old owns 400 pairs of trainers but says it is a tally that in the \u201cpantheon of big sneaker collections doesn\u2019t even register\u201d. The London depot \u2013 another site four times its size will open soon in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands \u2013 is the focal point for trade in the region. Each day several lorry loads of shoes and clothing are dropped at the back door for staff to vet, with the mountain of stock gradually sifted through the hands of an expert such as Miller before it can be okayed and sent on to the buyer. The average seller is a sole trader \u2013 literally \u2013 who has queued for new shoe releases or taken a punt on styles they think will increase in value. Sales attract a 3% payment processing charge and a transaction fee of 9.5%. But the shopper base is increasingly mainstream. \u201cIt started with core sneakerheads,\u201d says Luber. \u201cBut now it\u2019s about people who may have just bought their last pair of shoes at JD Sports or Footlocker but would never wade through eBay listings. The retail and resale market has started to blur together.\u201d In the London depot there are boxes of trainers piled to the ceiling but the reality is few of the trainers will ever be worn, as traders speculate that their value will increase. Miller, a collector with hundreds of pairs, confesses he has bought eight pairs of the Travis Scott Nikes \u2013 which stand out thanks to the reversal of Nike\u2019s famous swoosh on the side \u2013 but he wouldn\u2019t even contemplate trying them on. \u201cI\u2019m saving them for when they go up in price. I wear cheap sneakers myself, $200 max. For me to put $1,000 sneakers on my feet \u2013 I can\u2019t do it.\u201d Hot shoes on StockX Jordan 1 Retro High Travis Scott One of the most hyped and anticipated releases of the year. Travis released around 5,000 early pairs in to the market on the day of the Super Bowl and a similar amount on his birthday. Early pairs spiked at almost \u00a32,100 on StockX because they weren\u2019t released to the general public, making them extremely sought after. The market has now settled down with smaller sizes reaching around \u00a3900-\u00a31,300 with bigger sizes from \u00a3550-\u00a3800. Nike LD Waffle Sacai Blue Multi Sacai, a luxury Japanese fashion brand, collaborated with Nike to release the Waffle. Early pairs traded for \u00a3800-\u00a31,500 on StockX, which people were prepared to pay because they loved the shoe and weren\u2019t sure if it was ever going to be released more widely. The sneaker has now settled in price from \u00a3240 to \u00a3350 depending on size as they were eventually released in quantity. Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 v2 TRFRM Kanye West has been a huge influence in the sneaker industry for a long time now and his Yeezy True Form was particularly sought after as it was an EU only release \u2013 driving demand for them in Asia and North America. On release day the Yeezy 350 true form traded for around \u00a3250-300 on StockX but climbed to around \u00a3400 for some sizes in the days after the release. The market has been very steady now for a while and \u00a3300-\u00a3400 will be enough to secure a pair in your size, but smaller size Yeezys (UK 3.5-6.5) command a higher resell because there were fewer produced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
