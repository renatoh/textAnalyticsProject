Yorkshire joined Surrey in expressing horror at a bowl-out to decide who reaches the final at Lord's on August 31 but were clearly nowhere near horrified enough. Talks between the county and an ECB panel including the chief executive Tim Lamb failed to bring a solution. Yorkshire's chief executive Chris Hassell suggested waiting until lunchtime today before considering switching to a suitable ground within an hour's reach. The region's forecast was for heavy rain, so that appeared a miserable recourse to wishful thinking when a perfectly logical solution had been shunned. In Taunton, where a capacity crowd enjoyed a glorious semi-final yesterday, the forecast was encouraging. But Yorkshire have a Norwich Union one-day match against Nottinghamshire at Headingley tomorrow and resisted all talk of a 500-mile round trip. If no play is possible today, five nominated bowlers from each side will deliver two balls each at an unguarded set of stumps. If the sides are level after 10 deliveries the same bowlers will compete on a sudden-death basis. Hampshire have lost their appeal against an eight-point deduction for a poor pitch at the Rose Bowl for last week's championship match against Lancashire and must pay \u00a3500 costs. They remain second bottom. \u00b7 John Major, the former Conservative prime minister who is president of Surrey and serves on the MCC committee, has indicated he will not respond to grass-roots pleas to take over from Lord MacLaurin as chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
