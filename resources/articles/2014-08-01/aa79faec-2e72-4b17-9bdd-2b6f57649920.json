On a wet but wonderful Wednesday in Zurich Jo Pavey also received her women\u2019s 10,000m gold, while there was a silver medal for Andy Vernon in the men\u2019s 10,000m with bronzes for Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Ashleigh Nelson in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s 100m respectively. As Porter put it afterwards: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done so far is really special. On Tuesday what Jo did spurred us on and Mo\u2019s victory before I raced also gave me a boost.\u201d Britain has never finished top of the medal table at the European Championships but Porter cited the pre-event talk given by the team\u2019s captain, Goldie Sayers, who urged every athlete competing to go out and compete as if it was their last championships, as inspiring them to greater heights. Farah\u2019s victory got the evening off to the perfect start and, while it was not a vintage performance from Britain\u2019s most successful middle-distance athlete, he was delighted to claim gold after a wretched six months during which he has collapsed twice and disappointed at the London marathon. \u201cTo come out here and win it meant a lot to me, more than anything else in the world in terms of medals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably close to the Olympics because only three weeks ago I had to pull out of the Commonwealth Games and things weren\u2019t going so well.\u201d Afterwards Farah hugged his friend Usain Bolt, who had a front-row seat as Dasaolu won the 100m in a modest 10.06sec into a slight headwind. \u201cThis is a lovely feeling,\u201d admitted the 26-year-old from south London. \u201cIf I roll the clock back to February, I pulled my hamstring and didn\u2019t know if I was going to have a season. Fast-forward to Zurich and now I\u2019m European champion. It\u2019s been a dream end to my season and I just hope to use it as a platform to achieve better things in the future.\u201d Meanwhile Porter, who came under criticism from some quarters when she switched allegiance from America to Britain before the London 2012 Olympics, was also delighted with her first gold medal. \u201cThat was my aim at the beginning of the season, so I\u2019m very happy,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
