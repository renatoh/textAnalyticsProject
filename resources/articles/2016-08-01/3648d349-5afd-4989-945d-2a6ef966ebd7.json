Mourinho\u2019s United side secured their third successive victory of the new Premier League season at Hull City on Saturday evening \u2013 Marcus Rashford scoring an injury-time winner \u2013 and go into the international break joint top of the fledgling table. The ill feeling that was evident around Old Trafford during much of Louis van Gaal\u2019s reign as manager appears to have lifted before the derby against Manchester City on 10 September. Rooney, who created Rashford\u2019s late goal with a fine run and pass from the byline, praised the impact that Mourinho had made in such a short space of time and said it had been crucial for United to start the season well after their struggles in the years since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement. \u201cYou look at the years when Jos\u00e9 won the title at Chelsea, they always started well, but I think the way it\u2019s been for us the last two or three seasons, it was important for us as a team,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cJos\u00e9 has brought that experience in, that winning mentality again. That\u2019s showing in the players and it\u2019s maybe lacked over the last couple of years. \u201cIt\u2019s early but you want to try to build momentum and especially going into the international break. To go there with three wins is important and with the next game being Man City it was a big win for us, even though it\u2019s so early in the season. We know whatever happens against City isn\u2019t going to define the season but it\u2019s always nice to go into that break with the three wins. \u201cIt\u2019s a game players, staff, media, fans, everyone will be looking forward to. It\u2019s a Manchester derby but also with Jos\u00e9 and Pep Guardiola at Man City. It\u2019s exciting for everyone and exciting to play in.\u201d Rooney\u2019s position in the United team has come under question this season. The 30-year-old had not enjoyed the best of games at Hull before producing a telling piece of play in the dying moments to set up Rashford for a tap-in. Mourinho praised the England captain\u2019s display, insisting Rooney is not immune to being substituted but that his presence on the pitch until injury time was a tactical decision. \u201cI can take him out. It\u2019s no problem for me to take him out, no problem for him to be out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was just reading the game and feeling that playing with the two strikers, Marcus and Zlatan [Ibrahimovic], I needed [Henrikh] Mkhitaryan and Rooney just inside because the full-backs were the ones playing really wide on the touchline. \u201cI didn\u2019t need wingers because at this moment the wingers were [Antonio] Valencia and Luke Shaw, so instead of wingers I needed people to play inside in that position and I know that he\u2019s the guy with the vision for an assist and a feeling for the ball, and that he could perfectly be important, like he was.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
