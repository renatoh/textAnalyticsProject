Sites deemed threatened include the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the Pantanal in Brazil and the Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 and 111 others. But what about the Manu national park in Peru\u2019s Amazon, which Unesco calls the most biodiverse place on Earth and was declared part of a biosphere reserve in the 1970s? In south-east Peru and stretching for 1.7 million hectares from the tropical Andes to the lowland forest, Manu is home to extraordinary biodiversity and Harakbut, Matsigenka, \u201cMatsigenka-Nanti\u201d, \u201cMashco-Piro\u201d, Nahua, Quechua and Yine indigenous peoples. The WWF told the Guardian that Manu did not make its threatened list because \u201cat the time of the analysis it did not have any large-scale commercial mining, oil or gas concessions within or overlapping with the park\u2019s borders, and was not listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as at \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d threat from any non-extractive industrial activities.\u201d However, as the Guardian has reported over the last few years, Manu and its inhabitants do face numerous threats \u2013 including from mining, oil and gas. Here is a quick rundown: 1 A highway through the park Peru\u2019s government is planning to build a national highway along the course of the Manu river right through the middle of the park, effectively extending a route called the PE-5S. According to transport ministry maps, the highway will run all the way to the border with Bolivia, for 700 miles (1,130km). This would also mean entering the Bahuaja Sonene national park and the Tambopata national reserve, as well as linking up with the Inter-Oceanica highway which ultimately connects Peru\u2019s Pacific coast to Brazil\u2019s Atlantic coast. 2 Oil/gas operations in the park A Guardian expos\u00e9 in 2013 revealed how oil and gas company Pluspetrol was planning \u201cgeological fieldwork\u201d in \u2013 and \u201cthe development of\u201d \u2013 the far west of Manu, and how it had applied to enter the park in 2011 but was denied by the environment ministry agency, SERNANP, which manages it. Pluspetrol responded to the Guardian by saying it had no interest in exploring in Manu, but reports and rumours have emerged from the region suggesting that one company or other has operated there in recent years. In 2015 the Guardian published a leaked Pluspetrol map again showing its interest in Manu. The oil and gas industry has long eyed the park, and companies \u2013 including Shell \u2013 have conducted seismic tests there in the past. 3 Gas operations in the buffer zone Pluspetrol heads a consortium, including the US\u2019s Hunt Oil, Spain\u2019s Repsol and South Korea\u2019s SK Innovation, extracting and exploring for gas in the Kugapakori-Nahua-Nanti and Others Reserve (KNNOR), which is part of Manu\u2019s western buffer zone. The concession, called Lot 88, forms part of what is known as the Camisea gas project. It is almost immediately to the west of the very same area in Manu in which the Guardian, in 2013 and 2015, argued that Pluspetrol was interested. Over the years, operations in Lot 88 are reported to have had devastating impacts on the indigenous peoples in the KNNOR, which was established specifically for those living in \u201cisolation\u201d and \u201cinitial contact.\u201d In 2013 the culture ministry warned that expansion eastwards, towards Manu, could \u201cdevastate\u201d the Nahuas and make the \u201cMatsigenka-Nantis\u201d and Kirineris \u201cextinct\u201d, while SERNANP expressed concern it would lead to new settlements being established in Manu, increase pressure on natural resources, and potentially generate conflict among communities living there. But expansion was permitted, with plans to explore so far east that some seismic tests would be approximately 7.5km from Manu\u2019s western border and one well would be approximately 10km away. According to Perupetro, Pluspetrol drilled that well in 2015. 4 Coca cultivation and narco-trafficking in the park and buffer zone The UN\u2019s Office on Drugs and Crime\u2019s 2016 report on coca cultivation in Peru states that coca has been growing in Manu\u2019s buffer zone \u201cfor various years.\u201d In 2015 there were 809 hectares of coca in the buffer zone, the UN reports, although none in the park itself. The official management plan for Manu acknowledges the threat posed by coca cultivation to the buffer zone, as well as the recent \u201cappearance of maceration pits\u201d which it fears that \u201cat any given moment \u2026 will be dug inside the park\u201d too. In 2016 Peruvian media outlet Ojo Publico reported that an anti-drugs prosecutor based in Cusco had \u201cdetected various maceration pits even within the jurisdiction of the Manu national park, one of the Amazon\u2019s last natural paradises\u201d. 5 Illegal logging in the park and buffer zone The management plan calls illegal logging in Manu\u2019s buffer zone, particularly on the eastern side, \u201cthe real problem.\u201d Some indigenous communities have permission to extract wood from that area, but SERNANP holds no authority there and the environment ministry argues that the communities\u2019 operations are not properly supervised by the regional government. Loggers are sometimes reported to enter the park itself. 6 Mercury contamination from goldmining outside the park Goldmining has been estimated to have destroyed over 150,000 hectares in Peru\u2019s southern Amazon, mostly in the Madre de Dios region, and involved dumping 100s of tons of mercury into the rivers. In May 2016 the government \u2013 pathetically \u2013 announced a declaration of emergency across all Madre de Dios because of mercury contamination. According to a map based on preliminary research by scientists at the Duke Global Health Institute in the US, the most contaminated area in Madre de Dios is upriver from the mining along the stretch of the Madre de Dios river between towns called Boca Colorado and Boca Manu, a significant part of which is in Manu\u2019s buffer zone. The map suggests the second worst-hit area is inside the park, immediately upriver from Boca Manu, along the Manu\u2019 rivers left bank. The right bank is reported to be affected too. 7 A road through the buffer zone A road has been cleared along the right bank of the Madre de Dios river in the buffer zone of the supposedly \u201cprotected\u201d Amarakaeri communal reserve, just across the river from Manu. Members of two local indigenous communities, Shipetiari and Diamante, are reported to be in favour and detained approximately 40 people in 2015 to make themselves heard on the issue, but the road has provoked vigorous concern and/or opposition \u2013 from regional indigenous federation FENAMAD, local indigenous organisation COHARYIMA, a Cusco judge, the culture ministry, the environment ministry and even Unesco. According to SERNANP, which set in motion an official complaint about the road made by the environment ministry to a prosecutor in Madre de Dios against the regional governor and two others, it is \u201cclearly related to goldmining and illegal logging interests\u201d. Ultimately, it is slated to run to Boca Manu and then along the Manu river to Boca Colorado through Manu\u2019s buffer zone \u2013 effectively the same route identified for the PE-5S extension. 8 Deforestation in the park and buffer zone Between 2010 and 2014, Manu had more forest cleared than any other national park in Peru\u2019s Amazon with the exception of the Rio Abiseo national park in the San Martin region, according to a 2015 report by the environment ministry. That same report states that in its buffer zone 583 hectares were cleared. No possible causes were suggested, but the management plan cites coca and other agriculture as reasons for the deforestation in the buffer zone. 9 \u2018Human safaris\u2019 The appearance of a group of indigenous people living in \u201cisolation\u201d along the left bank of the upper Madre de Dios river in 2011 has led some tourist operators to offer trips to \u201cspot\u201d and photograph or film them. Such \u201chuman safaris\u201d have been vigorously condemned by FENAMAD and others \u2013 not only for the obvious ethical reasons, but because of the danger that contact poses to the \u201cMashco-Piros\u201d, as they are widely-known, because of their lack of immunological defences which means potentially fatal diseases can be easily transmitted to them. These \u201chuman safaris\u201d are arguably the most obvious indication of how the \u201cMashco-Piros\u201d and other indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d in Manu are being increasingly boxed in by what is going on around them \u2013 by the oil/gas operations, the road, the logging, the goldmining, coca, colonisation and even some tourism. Severe tension and conflict between them and their most immediate neighbours \u2013 Diamante and Shipetiari \u2013 has resulted in two men from those communities being killed in recent years. 10 Oil/gas operations to the park\u2019s east Hunt Oil, partnered by Pluspetrol and Repsol, runs an oil and gas concession immediately to Manu\u2019s east and overlapping most of the Amarakaeri communal reserve. The concession, Lot 76, includes parts of Manu\u2019s buffer zone, Shipetiari and another indigenous community bordering the park, although the area where Hunt has explored until now is to the east and on the other side of the Madre de Dios river. The prospective deposits \u2013 marked on the map above \u2013 appear to be part of the same trend as those in Lot 88 and Manu."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
