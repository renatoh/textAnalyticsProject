When I took my beloved elderly and frail dog to be euthanised, she (unusually) showed no reluctance to enter the vet\u2019s surgery, and died peacefully while I stroked her and talked to her.

Dr Brigid Purcell Norwich \u2022 You seem to carry a lot of Royal Opera House ballet pictures these days (Light-footed, 5 June). Could you perhaps venture out into the regions a bit more?

Jennifer Henley London \u2022 An attempt to cheer up Jane Marsh, who shares Nigel Farage\u2019s birthday (Letters, 5 June): 3 April is also the birthday of the wonderful guitarist and songwriter Richard Thompson and the late Tony Benn. I know because it is also my birthday. Michael Cunningham Wolverhampton \u2022 Surprised there was no mention of Peter May\u2019s excellent Lewis Trilogy in your piece about the Lewis chessman to be sold at auction (4 June).
