But the minor diplomatic coup was offset by Israel's relentless assault on the Palestinian towns of the West Bank. A day after President George Bush called on the forces to withdraw, at least 24 Palestinians were killed as the Israeli army increased its hold on the city of Nablus and moved into the nearby town of Tubas. Yesterday also delivered the greatest success to date of the army's eight-day offensive: the killing of the West Bank commander of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a military offshoot of Mr Arafat's Fatah movement which in recent months has taken the lead in attacks on Israel. The bodies of another seven Palestinians - suspected collaborators killed by their own - were discovered in Bethlehem. Mr Arafat could find small consolation in the visit of the US envoy, General Anthony Zinni, to his compound, now reduced to barbed wire-ringed mounds of rubble. However, the visit amounted to a defeat for Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who barred a European Union delegation from meeting Mr Arafat on Thursday, and has been vocal at his displeasure with America's diplomatic re-engagement in the Middle East. Israel did not receive Gen Zinni's visit in good humour. Troops threw stun grenades, fired rubber bullets and rammed the vehicles of journalists trying to cover the envoy's arrival, and Ranaan Gissin, Mr Sharon's spokesman said Israel wanted little attention drawn to the event. \"Zinni is not going there for a photo opportunity for hugging and kissing like the European Union, and that is precisely the point,\" Mr Gissin added. \"He is going to lay down a message about a ceasefire, and that is, take it or leave it.\" Gen Zinni emerged smiling from the 90-minute meeting. Officials said it would be followed by talks between US and Palestinian officials on America's ceasefire proposals. But Mr Sharon threw up an obstacle here too, barring Palestinian officials from meeting Mr Arafat ahead of the talks. In a meeting with Gen Zinni on Thursday, the prime minister was outspoken about his unhappiness with Washington's diplomatic efforts, saying the Israeli army must continue its occupation of Palestinian towns. Though international public opinion is against the sweeping military onslaught, Mr Sharon is on firm ground domestically. Yesterday, opinion polls showed 72% of Israelis supported a \"wide-scale war\" in the West Bank. About a quarter wanted Mr Arafat killed. Until last night Israel was claiming it would have a free hand to pursue the offensive until the arrival of the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, but Mr Powell yesterday demanded a withdrawal \"without delay\", saying Israel should not use the days before his visit to continue incursions. Until then, the international community remains concerned about the dangers of a widening conflagration. Yesterday, Israeli soldiers exchanged fire with Hizbullah guerrillas in Lebanon for the fourth successive day. Meanwhile, Israel advanced into the northern town of Tubas, killing six suspected members of the Islamist organisation, Hamas, and a 13- year-old girl. The Israeli army identified one of the Hamas men as a leading bombmaker, Qais Adwan. They said he was the mastermind of the Passover bombing in the coastal city of Netanya, which killed 26 Israelis - the deadliest attack in the 18-month uprising. However, the army's greatest success and fiercest battles came in Nablus. Last night, Palestinians gathered in mourning at the home of Nasser Awais, a founder of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, which has launched waves of suicide and shooting attacks against Israel since the start of the year. Despite the killing of Awais, the Israeli forces encountered fierce resistance in the city, slowing down the army's advance into three refugee camps. The army also failed to breach the old city, or casbah, whose narrow lanes are difficult terrain for Israeli tanks. Palestinian police said 15 people were killed as Israeli armour and Apache helicopters shelled and rocketed the refugee camps and the casbah, where most of the Palestinian fighters are concentrated. Three women and a teenage boy were among the dead, and 24 were injured but unable to reach hospitals because of a strict Israeli army curfew barring the movement of ambulances. Three Israeli soldiers were wounded in the gun battles. Inside the town, Israeli soldiers began rounding up Palestinian men, taking 80 away to a camp on the edge of town, and razing the homes of four wanted militants. According to Samar Halloush, whose husband was detained, the men were stripped naked and cursed at, but some were released after five hours. In northern Jenin, Israeli troops faced a second day of hand-to-hand combat, with a Palestinian policeman shot dead, and a soldier seriously wounded. \u00b7Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Arab countries yesterday, defying rubber bullets and tear gas, to vent their anger against Israel's military offensive. Protests turned violent in Bahrain, where demonstrators attacked the US embassy, in Jordan where riot police used water cannon and in Tunisia where police beat demonstrators with truncheons and clubs. Rallies in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon passed off more peacefully."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
