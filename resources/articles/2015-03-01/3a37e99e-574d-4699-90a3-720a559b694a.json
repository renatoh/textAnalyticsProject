The song then continues with a chord progression pretty much directly lifted from Donovan\u2019s Hurdy Gurdy Man. Russell Morris\u2019s hit is a song that in its nods to many of the most recognisable hallmarks of 60s psychedelia, from its use of \u201cphasing\u201d to the Hammond organ and sitar, has its roots firmly in San Francisco\u2019s Haight-Ashbury or London\u2019s Carnaby Street. But it was sung by a man from Melbourne and written by a Dutch immigrant who grew up in Perth. Though heavily derivative in nearly every aspect, singer Russell Morris and composer Johnny Young, along with producer Ian \u201cMolly\u201d Meldrum, are responsible for a single that sits as a seismic release in the history of recorded music in Australia. It reached No 1 in May 1969, dislodging Peter Sarstedt\u2019s nauseating Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)? and was itself replaced by the Beatles\u2019 Get Back/Don\u2019t Let Me Down. There is one ingredient, however, that does distinguish the track from the imported rock of the era. After 37 seconds Morris launches into his iconic \u201cooh mama mow mow\u201d refrain, an odd but zeitgeisty piece of nonsense \u2013 Meldrum, after all, wanted the song to sound like I Am The Walrus. In fact, the line was originally meant to be a guitar part, with Morris\u2019s improvised singing a mere guide for the guitarist. Meldrum had the nous to keep it. The Real Thing was written by Johnny Young upon returning to Australia in 1968, fresh from hanging out with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees in London. Meldrum overheard Young playing it in a TV studio one day, and saw it as the perfect fit for Morris, the producer\u2019s great new pop hope. The song\u2019s recording was an elaborate affair, with Meldrum gathering up a coterie of musicians from Melbourne\u2019s finest bands in a hell-bent quest to forge an all-encompassing sound in the vein of Strawberry Fields Forever (the Beatles) or Good Vibrations (the Beach Boys). It was a noble but wrongheaded mission: though passionate and with a keen ear, Meldrum was no George Martin or Brian Wilson. Over several months Meldrum\u2019s team toiled, and they did indeed make history. As far as Australian pop went, nothing had been quite this ambitious. As well as the sitars and the phasing (something those children of The Real Thing, Tame Impala, are so beholden to) the track is a patchwork of overdubs and, of course, runs for over six minutes (a shorter version was released for radio) thanks to the extended, multi-layered outro which today sounds somewhat thin. It was nevertheless a landmark sequence that proved that Australian studios could also create the new-fangled sounds floating down from the north. Such a complex piece was, somehow, recorded on a mere eight-track device by engineer John Sayers. Lyrically, the song is not as meaningless as it might seem. Young was apparently less than impressed by Coca Cola\u2019s advertising slogan proclaiming the drink \u201cthe real thing\u201d; the song was his retort, a celebration of authenticity amid the growing strength of such hollow rhetoric (which is ironic, when you consider that The Real Thing was recorded in many different parts and tracks using a myriad of studio techniques and effects, a method that would have been regarded as far from authentic by some purists in the 60s). Such is the stature of The Real Thing that both Midnight Oil and Kylie Minogue have recorded cover versions. And, the song made up part of the opening credits to the 90s children\u2019s TV program, The Afternoon Show. The Real Thing\u2019s biggest exposure in recent times, however, came when it and a Morris original, Wings Of An Eagle, were included on the soundtrack to Rob Sitch\u2019s 2000 film The Dish. Morris, who has often expressed some bewilderment at the fuss made over the song, kept up a successful solo career though failed to really penetrate beyond Australia. His 1973 album Wings Of An Eagle remains, perhaps, his critical highpoint, while at 66 he is still performing regularly and in fine voice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
