He\u2019s slim and stoic, with sad, almost haunted, eyes. The first thing he asks is if I\u2019d like to see \u201cthe dungeon\u201d. Who wouldn\u2019t? Lucke pulls on a Steeler\u2019s jacket and a baseball cap over brown hair that falls halfway down his back, and leads me across the five-acre yard. Out here, 90 miles east of Tucson, the desert is a long sweep of brush the color of beach sand. Lucke seems to slip through the rainy day like a ghost. The radio station, whose call letters are KHIL, has long been the daily soundtrack for this frontier town (population 3,500) that prides itself on its cowboy culture and quiet pace of life. But six decades after the founding of the station, the property is in foreclosure, with utility disconnect notices coming nearly every month. Small-town radio is fizzling nationwide, as stations struggle to attract advertisement dollars. And as station owners are forced to sell, media conglomerates snap up rural frequencies for rock-bottom prices, for the sole purpose of relocating them to urban areas. In a more affluent market, they can be flipped for a higher price. With limited frequencies available, larger broadcasters purchase as many as possible \u2013 especially those higher on the dial \u2013 in a race not dissimilar to a real estate grab. The \u201cdungeon\u201d turns out to be benign \u2013 just the original radio station building. Lucke explains that country music star Tanya Tucker \u201cused to hang out here with the jocks\u201d. This was before she recorded Delta Dawn at the age of 13 and left Willcox to produce a slew of hits, which landed her in the Country Music Hall of Fame. Her familiar drawl can still be heard at the top of every hour on KHIL, saying, \u201cHello, Willcox. This is Tanya Tucker, and you\u2019re listening to the station I always listened to when I was a kid.\u201d Except for a washing machine and stacking radio conductors, the dungeon is empty. From here, in a feat of electrical wiring, several radio stations (four of which are run by Lucke) are connected to the 5,000-watt radio tower behind the dungeon, and pushed out into the sky. KHIL was founded in 1958 by Rex Allen, who gained notoriety as the last of the singing cowboys. On the silver screen, The Arizona Cowboy could be seen strumming a guitar from the back of his horse, until the genre came to a close in 1954. He would go on to narrate a plethora of Disney movies, including Charlotte\u2019s Web, and for years was the voice behind Ford truck and Purina Dog Chow commercials. Allen \u2013 who died in 1999 \u2013 is now immortalized by a statue in the historic downtown. Born 31 December 1920 to Horace and Faye Allen in Willcox, Rex Elvie Allen was cross-eyed at birth, reads the plaque below the statue. At a time when local newspapers are vanishing at an alarming rate, the loss of a radio station leaves a community with another cultural and informational deficit. Communities are diminished when they lose their local radio stations, says Dennis Deninger, a communications professor at Syracuse University\u2019s Newhouse School. His first media job was working at an AM station in Hornell, New York, where obituaries were read on air along with board of education updates. \u201cWe connected with people,\u201d he remembers. \u201cWe told them stories about a fender bender that happened down on Main Street, or a local parade coming up, or the success of a youngster at the local science fair.\u201d The 1996 Telecommunications Act changed the radio landscape dramatically, allowing for deregulation, which led to the rapid consolidation of the industry. In the months after the act\u2019s passage, Reed Hundt, then the FCC Chair, spoke before Congress about \u201cfostering innovation and competition in radio\u201d and \u201c[promoting] diversity in programming and diversity in the viewpoints expressed on this powerful medium that so shapes our culture\u201d. And yet the act did not deliver on these ideals. Instead, for the first time, large media companies were allowed to buy up multiple stations without restriction. By 2002, the radio industry was essentially an oligopoly \u2013 just 10 parent companies controlled two-thirds of the listeners and revenue. \u201cConsolidation has, in a lot of ways, killed the radio business,\u201d says Barry Cohen, a former rural radio host and managing member of AdLab Media Communications, LLC. \u201cWith consolidation comes scale, and then you end up with an 800lb gorilla that has hold of resources, licenses and the market. You can have one entity owning six of the top stations in a single area.\u201d Those large operators \u201cbuy up the best stations and signals, sucking all the money out of the marketplace\u201d, says Cohen. As advertisers flock to larger stations, small independent radio operators like KHIL end up with fewer listeners, fewer sponsors, and far less revenue to get by. Today, the industry centers on remote service agreements \u2013 a shift driven by economics that has profound consequences for radio listeners. It\u2019s common now for a single automated center to feed content to a slew of stations across the country. Deninger sees this as particularly problematic for small communities. \u201cIf local radio stations are getting their content fed in from some distant studio in another state, you have less information about your home,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving less information about where you live and the people you live with \u2026\u201d He trails off. \u201cI can\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d But it\u2019s not just information on the chopping block \u2013 it\u2019s also identity, something that music uniquely reflects to a listener. Willcox rancher Dennis Williams explains that his agricultural community \u201cis struggling to hold on to its identity\u201d, and he regards KHIL as a critical touchstone, especially for the ageing population. Currently, 21% of Willcox is over the age of 60. When old-timers call the KHIL station to request a song, Lucke will scour eBay for records. When the vinyl arrives, sometimes from overseas, he\u2019ll hand-repair any scratches and spend hours adding them to his 11,000-song digital music library, which he\u2019s built over 14 years with personal funds. One elderly woman, who lived in the assisted living facility behind the station, sang a particular song at the county fair when she was 14 and hadn\u2019t heard the song since \u2013 until Lucke found it online and played it on KHIL for her. Dale Allen, who lives in the nearby community of Sunsites, Arizona, says the music on KHIL reminds him of growing up in Iowa and hanging out with his friends at a local hamburger joint. He doesn\u2019t have a computer or the internet, but listens to KHIL from a radio in his bedroom. \u201cI play it all night long,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I sleep, but I turn it on and listen to it, and then I go to sleep \u2026 It reminds me of the good old days.\u201d On a few occasions, he\u2019s wanted to find a specific song from his youth, and so he\u2019s developed a relationship with Lucke by phone. Lucke always comes through. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a man more knowledgable about music,\u201d he says. Years ago in Fort Worth, Texas, Lucke went to a honky tonk bar called Billy Bob\u2019s and had an experience that would transform the way he thought about curating music. \u201cYou can imagine me in a redneck bar,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019m the first one to get killed. I do not fit, especially when I have on my Van Halen T-shirt.\u201d He\u2019s also not a drinker because of childhood trauma \u2013 his parents both struggled with addiction \u2013 so Lucke says he people-watched, studying their reactions to the music. \u201cYou have your typical George Strait po-dunky songs, and there are people out there, but it\u2019s boring. No one\u2019s alive. And then all of a sudden, they put on Michael Jackson. And that dance floor was packed, like sardines. And then they went back to po-dunk, and it died.\u201d For Lucke, the lesson from Billy Bob\u2019s was clear as day. \u201cThere are no genres,\u201d he says, \u201cThese people may be mostly urban cowboys, but they want to hear Michael Jackson. The construction worker who listens to George Jones and Merle Haggard, I can have him listen to Van Halen if I trick him. If I package it.\u201d He likens packaging it to painting. He boldly mixes formats and weaves genres; his library is 75% female artists, even though he knows the old-timers will complain about too many women on the radio. And he\u2019s forever on a search for what he calls \u201cnuggets\u201d to add to his library \u2013 those songs with such emotional heft that the listener is entirely consumed by the story or the feeling and is transported to a different world. \u201cSometimes the songs talk to me, sometimes they don\u2019t. If they talk to me, I\u2019ll find a song and put it on my station. If they don\u2019t talk to me, I keep looking.\u201d \u201cWhat does it sound like when they talk to you?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d He pauses. He points to the very center of his chest. \u201cIt makes this terrible pain in here go away.\u201d The main station building is crisscrossed with wires, soundboards and computer monitors. Several household fans keep the equipment from burning up since the AC went out. The rest of the building is virtually empty, with the exception of two offices turned bedrooms where Lucke and his 21-year-old son, Tristan, sleep on cots. They\u2019ve lived here together since 2008, when they began sleeping on the floor of the lobby to deter vandalism and watch over the equipment. When Lucke began working at the station in 2003, KHIL and its sister station KWCX (then the only FM station in Willcox) were owned by Lakeshore Media, a national conglomerate. Then, the station employed a staff of 10 people. But over the next several years, there were multiple failed attempts to relocate KWCX to Tucson, which spooked advertising companies into pulling their ads. And because advertisements were sold for the two stations as a package, the financial damage spilled over on to KHIL. In 2007, a North Carolina based company purchased the sister stations and attempted to relocate KWCX to Tucson again. Again, the deal fell through. By 2008, Lucke says he was \u201cthe only employee here doing the job of three or four people, alone\u201d. In 2017, KHIL was sold again, this time to a local resident who gave Lucke minority ownership of the business and promised him a $1,500-a-month stipend to manage the station. But in May 2018, Lucke says that the man ordered him to divert ad revenue from KWCX (which was still owned by the North Carolina media company). Lucke says he refused and that he hasn\u2019t been paid since; according to a Department of Economic Security form signed by the owner, the non-payment was attributed to a lack of funds. The new owner did not respond to requests for comment. Lucke says he can\u2019t remember the last time he had a day off, and the homepage of his personal website now proclaims: \u201cKHIL has not paid Mark Lucke since April 2018! HVAC has been broken since December 2017! And he has still kept it on air!\u201d Mark and Tristan rely on Snap and Medicaid. He also hosts an online shop for his self-published horror novels and poetry collections, as well as KHIL coffee mugs and other merchandise. Both say that the only thing that makes them feel \u201cnormal\u201d is going to the Pizza Hut a few blocks away and sitting in the sunny window. It is there at the Willcox Pizza Hut, over a bowl of pasta and marinara sauce (which will last Lucke two meals), when he tells me that the pain in his chest feels like it\u2019s bursting out of him. Some of his earliest memories involve being taken to the honky tonk bar by his parents, and watching them get drunk. \u201cI saw horrible things as a child,\u201d he says. Ironically, many of those memories are set to the soundtrack of classic country music \u2013 Conway Twitty, Jim Reeves, Mel Tillis singing Send Me To Tucson \u2013 and can trigger his post-traumatic stress disorder. Lucke has a complicated relationship with Willcox, perceiving that much of the town thinks of him as a \u201chippie\u201d or an \u201coutsider\u201d, or assumes he\u2019s a drug dealer because of his long hair. Still, Lucke has continued playing music for Willcox. For rural radio stations to survive, Barry Cohen says \u201cthey must become embedded in the community to the point that they are considered a necessary utility. In turn, the community must support them with both listenership and ad dollars.\u201d \u201cMost people don\u2019t know that KHIL is in trouble,\u201d says Dennis Williams. \u201cBut if they did know, I think they would step up for Lucke. I really do.\u201d And if the station were to have more support, Williams says he can imagine an expansion of programming \u2013 early morning weather reports or community bulletins, and more interaction with the community. But for now, he says, \u201cLucke\u2019s whole focus is keeping that radio station alive. He asks nothing else from the world. And if it didn\u2019t exist, it would be a big hole in the community.\u201d This article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project and the Puffin Foundation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
