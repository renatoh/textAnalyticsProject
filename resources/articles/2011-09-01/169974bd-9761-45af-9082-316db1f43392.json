The injury-troubled midfielder is preparing to make his Manchester City debut. The England player will play in the Carling Cup against Birmingham City on Wednesday, three weeks before Mancini and his coaching staff had thought he would be ready when they took advantage of his release from Manchester United to sign him on a free transfer. Three years since he last completed a game, Hargreaves is expected to play for 45 minutes. He has not required any time with the club's physiotherapists, barring massages, since passing a medical examination on 30 August. He has also come through a series of specially arranged 60-minute practice matches. Mancini said: \"He has been very unlucky for the last years but he is still only 30, which is not old in football, and I don't think it's going to be a problem. He needs more time for his confidence but when he starts playing again I think he will always be available after that.\" Kolo Tour\u00e9 will also play, making his first appearance since the end of his six-month ban for testing positive for a banned substance. Tour\u00e9 inadvertently took bendroflumethiazide in some water tablets that were packaged as dieting pills; the Football Association hearing into his case heard evidence of a man who had been diagnosed with a medical condition that made him \"obsessed\" with a \"misplaced perception that he was fat\". There are no apparent concerns at Eastlands about Tour\u00e9's state of mind. \"It has been a really difficult time for him but hopefully that is behind him now and he can get back to doing what he loves, which is playing football,\" said Patrick Vieira, City's football development executive. \"The people who remain at the top have a strong mind but they are also hard workers, like Kolo. It has been hard for him. He has been through one of the most difficult periods of his career but now he has the opportunity to look forward.\" Carlos Tevez, who is now Mancini's third\u2011choice striker, will lead the attack and Mario Balotelli has been told he will start for the first time this season. The Spanish forward David Silva believes that playing in England is not helping his ambitions with his national team. He feels that his decision to sign for City and not Barcelona or Real Madrid has hurt his chances. \"Analysing my situation, I'm not happy but I don't foresee my prospects changing,\" he said. \"A lot of times I think about it that, yes, not ending up at Barcelona or Madrid hurt my chances.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
