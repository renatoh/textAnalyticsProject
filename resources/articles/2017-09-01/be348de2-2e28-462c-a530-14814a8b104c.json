She took two hours and 28 minutes on a frenzied Arthur Ashe court to quell the high-class challenge of Sevastova, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (4) and was the first of a strong American quartet to reach the semi-finals. After taking 11 months to recover from foot surgery, Stephens only began hitting a ball again in May and reappeared on the Tour at Wimbledon. Since then she has won 13 of 15 matches, this one the most significant by a margin. \u201cOh, man, this is just incredible,\u201d she said with the cheers of the crowd still ringing in her ears. \u201cWhen I started my comeback at Wimbledon I could never even have dreamed that this could happen: making the semi-finals of my home slam. It\u2019s indescribable. \u201cI just told myself to keep fighting. I have been staying so calm on the court. I knew I would get my opportunity. I had doubts, like a month ago, because I was worried about my protected ranking [83]. But once I realised my life is good, I play tennis, I have fun, I was able to release a lot of tension.\u201d Stephens was as commanding in the first set, which lasted 45 minutes, as she had been in the first week, but Sevastova\u2019s thoughtful tennis wore her down in the second. The Latvian world No17 - who put out Johanna Konta in the fourth round last year and Maria Sharapova at the same stage two days ago - is a throwback in the Justin Henin mould, a touch player with a sharp tennis brain and excellent anticipation, much like Agnieszka Radwanska. And she wins without big weapons; she had just the one ace in four matches before this quarter-final, and managed to double the tally. Both had to fight off fatigue under pressure in the deciding set, as service speeds dipped and groundstrokes went awry. Sevastova looked set to coast home at 3-1 up but three breaks in a row for four-all told the story of their shared tiredness. Nerves kicked in as they took extra care over their groundstrokes, waiting for mistakes on the other side of the net. Sevastova, who wins 53% of her points from deep, was loath to be tempted forward, but not so Stephens who prowled the net to good effect; a dumped Latvian forehand put the American four points from a place in the semi-finals, but Sevastova held to love. The pressure held to love again to force the tie-break, a first in the tournament for both of them. Stephens, whose serve had fallen as low as 66mph and had not managed an ace, looked to be at a disadvantage in the shootout, but she hit hard and sharply off the ground to cross at three-all. A netted forehand handed Stephens two match points, and she sealed it with a backhand down the line to wrap up a match of the highest quality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
