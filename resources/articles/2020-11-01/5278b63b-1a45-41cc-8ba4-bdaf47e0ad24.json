During the pandemic, I\u2019ve made sure to keep the right physical distance. I\u2019ve donned a cute reusable face mask and got myself tested at the first sign of mild symptoms. Like you, I\u2019ve been part of working together to benefit everyone. It\u2019s made me wonder what else I could be doing. I\u2019m across all the usual things \u2013 sorting my recycling, taking green bags to the supermarket, gifting my Mum a goat for Christmas \u2013 but Covid-19 really drove home this idea that by working together, we could make an actual difference. Not just to infectious diseases, but to making the planet a better place. So I did some research. Maybe I typed in how to do something positive for everyone \u2013 and I found out about B Corp certified. They\u2019re companies that are certifiably working towards a more sustainable world, socially and environmentally. They exist across all kinds of industries, from health to travel to finance, and sell products from luxury bedding to organic juice to tree saplings. And they all use their businesses to do good. Because I know how to have a good time during a pandemic, I made myself a spreadsheet. My task? Switch five of my lifestyle habits to a more sustainable B Corp option and start being the change I want to see in the world. Revamping a sustainable wardrobe When it comes to getting dressed, I\u2019ve always put comfort and convenience before longevity. I\u2019ve bought the $5 T-shirts and cheap kicks without really thinking too hard about where they came from or how many washes they might last (spoiler: not many). So my first stop on the B Corps trail was a more sustainable fashion choice. I found Allbirds Shoes, a totally carbon neutral footwear label. As well as using carbon offsets, they track emissions on the whole lifecycle of their shoes, and incorporate natural and recycled materials. Very cool. Finding a friendlier morning caffeine hit Next step in my routine: get my brain moving. Coffee is a tricky one for sustainability: big corporations take advantage of poor working conditions in many bean-growing countries, which lack the infrastructure to support fair working conditions and stable incomes. There are all sorts of factors to consider in placing a socially conscious order, from the milk you choose to the cup you drink from. I was excited to learn about Sample Coffee, one of only a few B Corp certified coffee roasters in Australia, which is transparent about ethical sourcing (and makes a great brew). Plus, I can have it in my favourite KeepCup \u2013 another B Corp certified business I love. Making the most of private moments When I\u2019m at work I mostly think of the bathroom as a place to scroll through social media and read recaps of terrible TV shows. But toilets play a big role in sustainability, too. Having a safe loo is an important part of access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene, all of which save lives. A great B Corp certified option is Who Gives A Crap, which donates 50% of its profits to help build toilets in countries such as Papua New Guinea and Kenya, and whose bog roll is plastic free. Putting my money where my sustainability is Maybe you already know this, but banks don\u2019t always have everyone else\u2019s interests at heart. Actually, I found out many of the world\u2019s big banks invest billions of dollars in industries that actively harm people, animals and the environment. I don\u2019t want to undo the good choices I\u2019m making, Luckily, there are \u201cclean money\u201d options such as Bank Australia. Switching my accounts means choosing a bank that\u2019s carbon neutral and runs a strict responsible banking policy that includes never funding industries such as fossil fuels, gambling and live animal export. Plus, it\u2019s the only bank in the world that actually runs its own conservation reserve. Planning a responsible post-Covid trip You\u2019re probably doing this too: daydreaming about finally taking a holiday. Stretching out on the beach, learning about local culture, trying new foods, weaving through incredible markets. Intrepid runs these fab small-group tours with local leaders, and it turns out it\u2019s committed to sustainability, too. It has been a certified B Corp since 2018, with a commitment to carbon neutrality, gender balance, child protection and animal welfare. Making better choices from the start Finding these sustainable alternatives was easy: there\u2019s a whole directory of B Corp certified businesses in Australia. But it\u2019s only the start. The next step for me is to keep making good choices. Now, when I need something new, I\u2019ll be thinking about the impact I\u2019m having. I\u2019ll research and reflect, and be part of the change for good.
