Nonetheless, all seemed well on day one of the congestion charge: TV and press pictures of near empty streets at rush hour - never mind that it is half-term. There were endless media interviews with people rediscovering the joys of cycling and ample opportunities for cheeky PR stunts and one-off ads from the likes of Carling. Only the Smithfield meat market workers, marching in protest at the toll, marred what appeared to be a surprisingly smooth introduction to Ken Livingstone's charge. But, hold on there Mr Mayor, was publicly claiming you were \"waiting for something to go wrong\" on day one really such a good idea? Wouldn't it have been better just to hold your breath? Until Thursday, day four, for instance, when Mr Livingstone was wading back in to his running battle with the London Evening Standard. The Standard claimed thousands of motorists had been fined by mistake, and London's mayor immediately filed an official complaint with the press complaints commission about what he claims is the Standard's \"negative\" coverage of the scheme. In a letter to the Standard's editor, Veronica Wadley, the mayor of London said the paper's front page splash was a \"bare-faced lie\". \"The Evening Standard is bad for London. It is a 'knocking paper' that constantly attacks anything that is good for this city,\" he said. Whatever the merits of his case - the tense of the Standard's headline, which claims \"thousands are charged by mistake\", is certainly questionable when fines are only being sent out now - Mr Livingstone's problem is that he has given the paper even more ammunition. How will the paper play it when the proof comes of the inevitable mistakes? It will be front page news again, and the spin on the headline will be just as bad. Surely the mayor's most senior PR advisor, ex-Labour party communications chief Joy Johnson, and her team could have foreseen the Standard's tack? Johnson and co must try harder to avoid this storm in a C-zone escalating and obscuring the real issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
