The comedian appeared as a guest on Victoria Coren Mitchell\u2019s Heresy talkshow on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday where she made a comment about throwing the substance at \u201cunpleasant characters\u201d instead of milkshakes. It prompted the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage \u2013 who had a milkshake thrown on him while campaigning in Newcastle during the EU elections \u2013 to accuse her of inciting violence and urge the police to act. On Wednesday, he shared an article on Twitter about Brand\u2019s controversial comments, adding: \u201cThis is incitement of violence and the police need to act.\u201d On Thursday Scotland Yard said it had received an allegation of incitement to violence and that it was being assessed. It said inquiries were continuing but no arrests had yet been made. It is understood the complaint to police was not made by Farage or the Brexit party. A spokeswoman for the comedian declined to comment but, after questioning from Sky News earlier in the day, Brand told reporters that freedom of speech in comedy was \u201cextremely important\u201d. Responding to a question about the \u201cterrible time\u201d in politics that the country was going through, Brand said on the Heresy show: \u201cWell, yes, I would say that but that\u2019s because certain unpleasant characters are being thrown to the fore and they\u2019re very, very easy to hate and I\u2019m kind of thinking: \u2018Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?\u2019\u201d Her remarks prompted roars of laughter from the audience. The 61-year-old comedian went on to clarify she was joking and not a fan of milkshake stunts. \u201cThat\u2019s just me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it, it\u2019s purely a fantasy, but I think milkshakes are pathetic, I honestly do, sorry.\u201d Coren Mitchell said at the end of the show that she hoped Brand\u2019s comments had not caused offence, adding that the series had been established to \u201ctest the boundaries of what it\u2019s OK to say and not say\u201d. Coren Mitchell responded to Farage\u2019s tweet on Wednesday, writing: \u201cNigel! I\u2019m genuinely disappointed; we don\u2019t agree on everything, but I would totally have had you down as a free speech man. Especially when it comes to jokes.\u201d Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, has received 65 complaints about the episode of Heresy. On Thursday, Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman called on the BBC to explain why it broadcast Brand\u2019s comments. He said: \u201cThe prime minister has been repeatedly clear that politicians should be able to go about their work and campaign without harassment, intimidation or abuse. \u201cI note that Brendan Cox has said that violence and intimidation should not be normalised and we should consistently stand against it. \u201cThe prime minister shares this view. It is for the BBC to explain why it considers this to have been appropriate content for broadcast.\u201d On Wednesday the BBC defended Brand\u2019s remarks, then announced on Thursday that it would be editing the programme to remove Brand\u2019s joke from the corporation\u2019s online streaming service and any future airings. A spokeswoman said: \u201cWe carefully considered the programme before broadcast. It was never intended to encourage or condone violence, and it does not do so, but we have noted the strong reaction to it. Comedy will always push boundaries and will continue to do so, but on this occasion we have decided to edit the programme. We regret any offence we have caused.\u201d Former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, twice had milkshakes thrown over him last month during his failed campaign to become an MEP."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
