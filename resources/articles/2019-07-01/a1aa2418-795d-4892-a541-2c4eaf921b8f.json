Grant Thornton was the worst performer in the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s annual review of audits by the UK\u2019s big accountants. The FRC said half of the eight Grant Thornton audits it inspected for 2017/18 required significant improvement. Across the industry, one in four audits failed to reach required standards, a finding that will intensify pressure on the firms, which are all already under scrutiny by the Competition and Markets Authority. The audit of Patisserie Valerie was among those looked at by the FRC. Other Grant Thornton audits inspected by the regulator included the outsourcing company Interserve, which was sold in March after administrators were appointed, and Woodford Patient Capital Trust, the embattled investment trust run by the former star investor Neil Woodford. The FRC also reviewed Grant Thornton\u2019s audit of Sports Direct. Over the last five years Grant Thornton scored by far the worst of the accounting firms with 26% of inspected audits deemed to require improvement. The FRC ordered Grant Thornton, the UK\u2019s sixth biggest accountant, to come up with a plan to overhaul its audit work and said it would inspect more of its work this year. \u201cThis level of audit quality is unacceptable,\u201d the FRC said. \u201cThe quality of the audits inspected in the year, and indeed the overall lack of improvement in quality over the past five years, is a matter of deep concern.\u201d Grant Thornton\u2019s chief executive, David Dunckley, exasperated MPs in January when he said it was not his firm\u2019s job to uncover fraud or judge that a company\u2019s books were correct. The FRC also criticised PwC, one of the big four accountants, for an unsatisfactory drop in the results for its audits. Only 65% of the firm\u2019s audits of FTSE 350 companies required no more than limited improvements, down from 84% a year earlier and well short of the FRC\u2019s 90% target. No auditor achieved the 90% target despite pressure on the sector to improve after a series of scandals including the collapses of BHS, audited by PwC, and Carillion, audited by KPMG. Audits carried out by PwC that the FRC inspected included Kier Group, the construction and services company whose recent profit warning prompted comparisons with Carillion, and the struggling department store chain Debenhams. The FRC did not disclose which audits were substandard from the list of companies it reviewed. The regulator said its review showed no improvement from the year before and all seven firms inspected had failed to challenge companies\u2019 management properly on matters of judgment. It increased its target for acceptable audits of FTSE 350 companies to 100% from next year and extended the 90% target to smaller companies. Grant Thornton said it had published details of planned improvements to its audit practice and was working with the FRC to implement its plan. \u201cSome of our past audits for large listed firms have fallen short of the standards we expect,\u201d the firm said. Stephen Haddrill, the FRC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAt a time when the future of the audit sector is under the microscope, the latest audit quality results are not acceptable. Audit firms must identify the causes of their audit shortcomings and take rapid and appropriate action to improve quality.\u201d Hemione Hudson, PwC\u2019s head of audit, said: \u201cWe are disappointed that the results of the inspection are below the high standards we are committed to achieving on all of our audits.\u201d The big accountants have faced criticism from MPs for lax audit checks that put companies, jobs and taxpayers at risk when large companies such as Carillion collapse. The industry\u2019s critics have accused the firms of not standing up to big clients and the FRC of being too cosy with the firms it is meant to hold to account."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
