Nominated for the Brits critics\u2019 choice award and BBC Sound of 2016 poll, the singer-pianist didn\u2019t get here by upsetting applecarts: her occasional brushes with synthpop \u2013 the lovably clattery No Matter could have done duty as an Ellie Goulding single \u2013 only highlight the deep traditionalism elsewhere. Someone has to do it, though, and for fans of mainstream balladry, Frances has much to offer in the way of warmth and craft. Generally, the sparser, the better; when it\u2019s just her keyboard, wistful voice and an unassailable melody (Don\u2019t Worry About Me, say), she\u2019s rawer than you might expect. Dabbling with high-sheen pop, on the other hand (eg, the Greg Kurstin-produced Say It Again), rinses away the vulnerability that\u2019s her strong suit. As an overall introduction, though, the album portends a future bookended by the Radio 2 playlist and not undeserved comparisons to Adele."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
