The 30-year-old striker, who has resumed light training after tendinitis in his left knee and two operations, is due in Paris on August 7 for a consultation with his American surgeon Dr Richard Steadman, the man who appears to have saved Ronaldo's career. \"I think Dr Steadman's quite happy to see Alan [in Paris],\" said Newcastle's manager Bobby Robson, who added of Shearer: \"He started at nothing because he hasn't played for a long, long time, so his fitness level dropped to zero. He's now up to 75% and well on the way.\" Fabrizio Ravanelli has chosen not to join Derby County. \"I'm staying at Lazio; it's my wish,\" said the 32-year-old, a reserve striker at the Italian club. Real Oviedo have told Wolves they will not release Stan Collymore on loan, though they are prepared to sell the striker, who retired five weeks into an 18-month contract. \"We are still awaiting a response for the offer to sell we made last week,\" a club spokesman said. Eyal Berkovic, 29, was at Manchester City for a medical yesterday and is expected to sign a four-year deal. City have already applied for a work permit for the Israeli, who will cost \u00a31.5m from Celtic. \"Even if [the manager Martin] O'Neill was to come back to me now and say that I would be in his team every week, I would tell him to forget it,\" Berkovic said. Ipswich are interested in Real Mallorca's Finidi George. The 30-year-old Nigeria midfielder would cost about \u00a34m. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
