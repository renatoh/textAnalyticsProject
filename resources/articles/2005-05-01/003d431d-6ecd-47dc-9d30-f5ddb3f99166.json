The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health is concerned that its members increasingly fear the consequences for their careers if they report suspicions that a child's injuries could have been inflicted deliberately. Many paediatricians have been the subject of complaints to the General Medical Council, often by parents who have had their children taken into care. These complaints can take a year or sometimes more to investigate and resolve, which is traumatic for any doctor who has reported the injuries in good faith. The furore around medical evidence in high-profile cases such as those of Sally Clark, Trupti Patel and Angela Cannings has made paediatricians even more anxious. In an informal poll during the recent annual meeting of the Royal College, 60% of trainees said they would not be prepared to do child protection work. \"We find that extremely concerning,\" said Sir Alan Craft, college president. \"We have been worried for two or three years about the reluctance of all paediatricians to get involved.\" If the new recruits felt this way too, the future for child protection looked grim. \"It is seeing people who were leaders of the profession being pilloried in the press and discredited,\" he said. \"They didn't come into medicine for that, they came in to help children.\" While recognising that the public must have a way to log a complaint against a doctor who is incompetent, the college is exploring ways to protect paediatricians from unjustified or malicious complaints. One option is to make reporting of suspected child abuse mandatory, so that doctors who did not report would be breaking the law. Another possibility is to give paediatricians mandatory protection. It would absolve from fault a doctor who had reported the suspected abuse in good faith. As things stand, neither route would prevent a paediatrician from being brought before the GMC, which has a duty to investigate any complaint against a registered practitioner. A further possibility would be to ensure complaints against doctors in legal proceedings are handled by the judge. \"The vast majority of parents who have been disgruntled have come through some sort of legal process,\" said Professor Craft. \"Their child has been taken away. The time to complain is at the legal hearing in evidence to the judge.\" Vast numbers of complaints have been laid before the GMC in relation to two paediatricians in particular - David Southall and Sir Roy Meadow. Professor Southall has been banned from child protection work, while Professor Meadow's case is yet to be heard. But GMC complaints have become a professional hazard for all doctors working in child protection and appear to be becoming a deterrent. Sir Alan said: \"People in modern society do not like authority, particularly when things go wrong. It is not just in child protection. Aggrieved people complain about anything.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
