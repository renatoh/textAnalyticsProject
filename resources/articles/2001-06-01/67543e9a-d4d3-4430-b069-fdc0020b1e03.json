As it expanded, it added ethical dimensions, promising to link efficiency with social conscience and profitability with good business ethics. But green credentials are not enough. Ethical investors such as Rathbones have sold following a disastrous expansion. It had done everything right from cancelling an order for Norwegian prawns as a protest against Norway's whale fishing, involvement in local communities, the \"Food You Can Trust\" label as a response to the BSE crisis, espousing organics, and its refusal to stock genetically modified (GM) food. But then came the turning point. In May 2000, Iceland announced it was merging with Booker, Britain's largest cash and carry operation. Despite its commercial potential, the deal was not universally welcomed by the City. An additional dilemma for ethical investors was the fact that over 25% of group turnover would come from tobacco sales. It cut back on cigarette sales - but not far enough. Then executives were in and out on revolving doors, leading to a backtrack on the green stance which had not anyway chimed with the firm's often downmarket customer base. But the right company at the right time may still manage to deliver the dream of food retailing with a conscience. And that company may yet prove to be Iceland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
