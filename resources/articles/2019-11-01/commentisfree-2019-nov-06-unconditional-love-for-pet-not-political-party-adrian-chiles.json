It is called The Unheard Third. In the UK, there are about 52 million people of voting age. In the last general election, about 20 million of them didn\u2019t vote. That gives you a turnout figure much lower than the official 68.8% because that is a percentage of registered voters. The number of unregistered potential voters runs into millions. So I have been going around the country asking those people why they don\u2019t vote. I was expecting to get a lot of stuff along the lines of \u201cI just don\u2019t care\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered\u201d \u201cPoliticians are all useless/dishonest\u201d, \u201cThey\u2019re all the same\u201d, \u201cThey let us down over Brexit\u201d and so on. And I got a fair amount of that, but a couple of other major things, too. On West Bromwich High Street, the main problem seemed to be the weakening of tribal loyalties. They are still there, of course; I got more than one person telling me: \u201cI always vote Labour, Ade. It\u2019s like supporting the Albion, isn\u2019t it?\u201d But I don\u2019t think it should be like supporting a football team; it\u2019s more important than that. My heart sinks whenever I hear anyone say they always, no matter what, vote Labour or Conservative or SNP or whatever, because that kind of political loyalty is often just an easy alternative to even the most casual intellectual inquiry into the complexities of policies. I suppose if you are going to vote for A Particular Party, come rain or shine, there\u2019s not much point taking that much interest in the detail anyway. No, unconditional love is all very well for children, football teams and pets, but not for politics. Yet there is less of it about. Very often in West Bromwich I was told something along the lines of: \u201cMy family were always Labour/Conservative/whatever, so that\u2019s what I always voted for, but now I just don\u2019t know who to choose.\u201d In other words, in the absence of a strong family policy, they have to give actual thought to who to vote for. This would be a good thing, as long as the electors felt equipped to make a decision; but very many of the people I have spoken to do not. At a food bank in Hastings this week, a typical answer to my \u201cWhy don\u2019t you vote?\u201d question was, rather sweetly: \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to, but I really don\u2019t understand any of it.\u201d On the one hand, this isn\u2019t surprising, as the rudiments of our political system are not really taught in schools. And then there is the challenge of picking some truth out of the skipfuls of claims, counter-claims, obfuscation, fake news, downright lies and general waste matter emanating from politicians everywhere. On the other hand, my interviewees\u2019 pleas of ignorance were a nonsense. As I barked at many clients of that food bank: \u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t understand it? That implies you think there are people out there who do understand it! There aren\u2019t. I definitely don\u2019t. And anyone \u2013 not least MPs themselves \u2013 who claims to be fully across everything simply doesn\u2019t know enough about it. Not voting, or even registering, might be your political decision. Fair enough. But, please, don\u2019t decide not to vote because you think you don\u2019t know enough; your vote is as valid as anybody else\u2019s, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d Rant over. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
