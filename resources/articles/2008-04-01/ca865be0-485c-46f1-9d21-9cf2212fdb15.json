Instead of an analysis of his side's achievements in reaching the Champions League semi-finals, Liverpool's manager was dismayed to read that Parry had attended a meeting in California with J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann late last year at which Hicks and Gillett were also present. \"I was surprised to hear of meetings and surprised who the people in those meetings were,\" admitted Ben\u00edtez. \"I'm really calm but I want answers. I am surprised at things I have read.\" When details of such talks were first leaked, Hicks and Gillett claimed they had met the former Germany coach to discuss a potential vacancy at Anfield because they had doubted Ben\u00edtez's \"commitment\" but it was not known until yesterday that Parry - a man Hicks now wants to replace - also flew to America's west coast. Moreover Ben\u00edtez seemed deeply perturbed by claims that Hicks - with whom he has recently been described as having negotiated an \"uneasy truce\" - remains in touch with Klinsmann and has even reportedly asked the German coach what he thinks of the current Liverpool manager's proposed summer signings. Ben\u00edtez had apparently believed that Gillett - a man he is seemingly no longer on speaking terms with - was the Liverpool co-owner closer to Klinsmann but last night he sounded deeply mistrustful of both Americans. His relations with Parry have long been strained but Ben\u00edtez never dreamed Liverpool's chief executive had apparently been so involved in the courting of Klinsmann. \"I need clarification about a meeting with a lot of people I did not know about,\" reiterated a manager persistently linked with a possible move to Real Madrid. \"I was surprised to read about a meeting with another manager. What concerned me was the people who were in the meeting. I will talk to the board about this as soon as possible, today or tomorrow.\" Ben\u00edtez said his players were unaffected by the boardroom war and he was pleased to see them establish a five-point advantage over fifth-placed Everton on a day when Fernando Torres scored his 30th goal of the season. \"We are professionals,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"We know when to be focused and we will try to stay focused.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
