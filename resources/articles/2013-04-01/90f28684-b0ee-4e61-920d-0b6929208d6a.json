Woods lies four adrift of the joint leaders, Brandt Snedeker and Angel Cabrera, but the most significant drama of day three arose before anyone had even hit a ball. Woods was handed a two-stroke penalty after meeting with Masters rules officials at eight o'clock on Saturday morning. Woods said: \"The day started off obviously different but I'm right there in the ball game. As of right now I'm four back with a great shot to win this championship. Under the rules of golf I can play. I was able to go out there and compete and play. I got all activated and ready to go, and once I came to the course I was ready to play.\" Woods's third shot to the 15th during round two on Friday hit halfway up the flagstick and spun back into the creek. At that point, the 37-year-old had three options for his next shot: play it from a designated drop area; play from in line with where the ball last crossed the water hazard; or play from the original spot. Woods took the final option but his post-round comments highlighted an advantage from moving the ball placement by two yards. Woods avoided disqualification on the basis the rules committee had earlier been made aware of the incident, studied it and decided no infringement had occurred while he was still on the course. Yet the choice of penalty triggered a fierce reaction; Sir Nick Faldo was among those who called on Woods to withdraw from the tournament. Butch Harmon, Woods's former coach, stressed his former pupil should have suffered disqualification. When asked if he had considered withdrawing, Woods said: \"No, because they already made the determination prior to me finishing the 18th hole. The rules committee had already made that determination that everything was fine.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
