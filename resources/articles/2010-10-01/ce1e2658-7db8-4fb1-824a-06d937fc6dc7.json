Anglo-French co-operation on nuclear patrols and the kicking of Trident into the long grass of after the next election (Report, 19 October) are to be welcomed on political and economic grounds. The only question is whether or not the senior military figures who told the last Labour government it couldn't be done will be rightly among the first to get their P45s when the defence cuts bite. Glyn Ford (Labour MEP 1984-2009), Cinderford, Gloucestershire \u2022 Britain may well punch above its weight after these cuts, but it would serve the country better if it thought more in terms of how its forces knit into the EU. Somehow or other, I believe there should be a Nato without the presence of the US and that Europe should pursue its own interests. It appears that the US supplies much of the rapid transport needed by Nato forces and this problem needs to be planned for and shared by the EU alone. From my knowledge of the Royal Navy, it seems to be heavy in top brass, and I hope cuts are made in this sector as the navy is reduced in strength. Donald T Hart Baltimore, USA \u2022 There's been a lot of criticism of the management of defence by the last government, no doubt some of it true. But what a way to manage a withdrawal from Germany: the mind boggles at the thought of taking 10 years to withdraw from a friendly country. Withdrawal should have taken place years ago. Germany can defend itself without us having to pay for it. Derek Emsley Kingussie, Inverness-shire. \u2022 I find it difficult to understand how we need two new aircraft carriers and a replacement for Trident if we can do without the present Ark Royal's strike capability for 10 years, the Queen Elizabeth is to then be in service for just three years, and there will be a gap of five years before a Trident replacement becomes available. Either we need these capabilities or we do not. I think we do not \u2013 and we do not yet have a rational presentation as to what these very expensive pieces of hardware are to do to enhance national security. John Chubb Cheltenham, Gloucestershire \u2022 No naval jets, only one aircraft carrier for the next 10 years \u2013 one has to assume that the government has also ceded the Falkland Islands to Argentina, as there is now no way we can defend them.
