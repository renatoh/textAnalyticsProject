Mark McGwire, aka Big Mac, has announced his retirement, bringing down a sudden if not entirely unexpected curtain on the career of the man whose aptitude for swatting balls over fences reignited North America's passion for baseball. McGwire, as the St Louis Cardinals' first baseman, made an indelible name for himself by hitting 70 home runs in the 1998 season, improving the previous record by a margin unseen since the heroics of Babe Ruth 78 years earlier, and reviving a moribund sport. In a statement full of modesty one might not have expected of a man often harangued for considering himself bigger than the game, McGwire said he had turned down a two-year contract extension because he felt \"unable to perform at a level equal to the salary the organisation would be paying me\". Blighted by injury over the past two seasons, McGwire, 38 last month, had stated more than once that he was contemplating retirement, although the timing and means (a statement to the sports network ESPN) took the Cardinals by surprise. \"The guy is a first-class guy,\" stressed the manager, Tony La Russa. \"I find it hard to believe he wouldn't call the owners or [general manager Walt] Jocketty first.\" A match-winning grand slam - a home run hit with all the bases loaded - in the second game of the 1988 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers apart, McGwire's record when it counted was very modest. The Oakland A's reached three successive Series from 1988 to 1990, but their failure to win more than one was due in no small part to McGwire's limp form. In his five seasons on the banks of the Missouri, the Cardinals failed to qualify for the final stage. Set against that are 583 homers, fifth on the all-time list, compiled at a rate that, three or four more seasons at peak fitness permitting, would have seen him overhaul Hank Aaron's 755. A member of the 1984 US Olympic baseball team, the 6ft 5in Californian slammed 49 home runs for Oakland in 1987, a record for a slugger in his maiden full season which earned him the American League Rookie of the Year award. Not until 1995, though, did \"McGee Whiz\" suggest he was more than a one-off, but by then an intense liaison with the weights room had trebled his triceps. Cue 91 homers in two seasons at an unprecedented average of one every 8.12 at-bats - and inevitably mutterings of chemical assistance. He admitted taking androstenedione, a muscle booster banned in many sports but not baseball. In 1998, the year of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, the major leagues were still suffering the bitter fallout from the 1994-95 players' strike. Fortunately McGwire and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs began swiping balls with such abandon that the single-season home run record of 61, set by Roger Maris 37 years earlier, was not so much beaten as demolished. Time magazine anointed McGwire \"Hero of the Year\". \"He couldn't banish the stain of sleaze nor could he restore civility to our discourse or turn the media's attention to rotten schools or Serbian brutality,\" it proclaimed. \"He is, after all, only a baseball player. But what a baseball player he is, and what balm he brought to a nation that seemed to spend the year flaying its flesh.\" For that alone, memories of \"Big Mac\" will long be consumed with all-American relish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
