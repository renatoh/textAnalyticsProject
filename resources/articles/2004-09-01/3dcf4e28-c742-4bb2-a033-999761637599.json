Either way, there's a wealth of inspiration to be had at next weekend's Open House London - from white rendered Bauhaus semis in Ruislip, to multicoloured metal shipping containers- turned-artists' studios at Tower Hamlets. Back for its twelfth year, the event will be the biggest ever, with nearly 600 buildings open free of charge. Forget makeover shows on TV - this weekend offers a rare first-hand glimpse of some of our finest architecture and interiors. New this year is 30 St Mary Axe (aka the 'Gherkin') in the City; a U-shaped house with cascading glass atrium in Highgate; and the wooden-clad new-build 'Big House' in Mortlake. Old favourites include Erno Goldfinger's monumental Trellick Tower, the Foreign Office, and - for the last time before its refurbishment - Sir George Gilbert Scott's St Pancras Chambers at the former Midland Grand Hotel. Further afield you can visit a golden-domed Sikh temple in Southall, or go on a tour of the Becontree Estate in Dagenham, built in the 1920s and 1930s and once the largest estate in Europe, with 25,000 houses. For something more unusual, visit the disused Kingsway Tram Subway, built in 1906 as the link between the northern and southern sections of the tram network. 'It's not a static exhibition - there are always new buildings being added,' says Victoria Thornton, founding director of Open House London, who admits that choice can be overwhelming. 'It's like when you go to a big art exhibition - you don't know where to start.' The advice is to plan ahead (get a list of buildings from local libraries or the website) and be prepared to queue. The owners of more than 70 private residential houses are taking part in the event. 'They're sharing their home with strangers for the day - that openness is incredible,' says Thornton. 'It's not a very British thing to do - in some countries you can knock on someone's door and they'll let you in and show you around.' One of Thornton's favourites is 'Glass House One' in Forest Hill. Built by architect-owner Chris Firth, it is one of two live-work units on the cobbled mews and artists' enclave Havelock Walk. The three-storey steel and glass house has an innovative curved glass roof to provide light (the building is attached on three sides). 'We got so many requests from people wanting to have a look around,' says Firth. Columbian architect-designer Lucho Brieva is also partaking in Open House for the first time. His Kensal Rise live-work space, a former Victorian stables and railway depot, has a metal workshop and gallery on the ground floor, with a living space above. On the second floor is a recording studio in which Brieva, who was formerly married to Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde, is recording an album in collaboration with former Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera. Brieva's living space is a lesson in minimalism. 'It's important to have a place that is sacred, where you can recharge,' he says. He has a very emotional connection with his living space - although he doesn't mind opening it to the public. 'I thought, why not? It is a way of promoting my work and I like to see people's faces when they walk into the house.' Fans of Grand Designs should visit 'Seven-and-a-half Trouville Road' in Clapham. The show documented Anjana and David Devoy's brave attempt at a self build with - in presenter Kevin McCloud's words - a 'tight schedule, a tight budget, and no experience'. Designed to curve around a protected chestnut tree, and turning its back on the surrounding housing estates, the build was problematic and unfinished when the programme was broadcast in February. Next year, five new residential buildings inspired by Open House will themselves be open for the weekend. 'It directly encouraged [these self-builders] to have a better dialogue with their architects,' says Thornton. 'That's the main aim: to help people understand and enjoy their environment. Once you do that, you can demand better buildings.' The President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, George Ferguson, praised Open House and its associated event for children: 'We're visually illiterate as a nation, compared with other European countries... If one can get the young interested in architecture, the parents get involved too.' Open House has sparked similar events across the country. This weekend's national Heritage Open Days scheme, co-ordinated by the Civic Trust and largely funded by English Heritage, has highlights including Elizabeth Gaskell's regency-style house in Manchester and - open for the first time in 20 years - the Small Concert Room at St George's Hall, Liverpool, where Charles Dickens read extracts from his works."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
