Only 24 hours after Barwick had questioned the wisdom of Alan Smith's decision to turn down Eriksson's late invitation to join the squad for tonight's friendly against Denmark, the England manager insisted he would not hold a grudge against the United forward. \"The important thing is that I have nothing against Alan Smith,\" said the England coach. \"To say he will be out of my plans in the future . . . absolutely not.\" His stance should reassure Smith and has partially succeeded in pacifying Sir Alex Ferguson, who had given serious consideration to speaking out in defence of his player. Having waited to see Eriksson's comments, United made do with releasing a statement to re-iterate that his motive for turning out in a reserve match against Bolton Wanderers was to improve his condition and \"by no means due to a lack of desire to play for England\". Ferguson is understood to be disturbed that Barwick has questioned the attitude of one of his players so clumsily. United maintain the FA had been told of Smith's intentions on Friday. This information was apparently not relayed to Eriksson, who named Smith on Saturday evening as a replacement for Andy Johnson. Smith was bemused and United officials contacted Eriksson's aides on his behalf. Eriksson even offered to take personal responsibility to defuse the row. \"I blame myself,\" he said. \"But if there is any player who could do well for England then, yes, of course I would pick him in the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
