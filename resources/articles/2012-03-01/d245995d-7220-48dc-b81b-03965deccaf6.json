He works as an arts officer for a medium-sized charity. He runs an entire section and, as an experienced professional and a writer in his own right, has brought a wealth of development, contacts and credibility to the organisation. When he took up the post three years ago he negotiated a slightly higher salary than was offered. There has been no further increase, despite him developing the role and receiving a lot of acclaim for his work, both in the organisation and outside. Six months ago he approached the director to discuss whether he could be upgraded to be part of the management team along with a modest increase in salary. Historically, his post is not part of the management team, although he manages the entire literature section and is responsible for staff and interns. The director took three weeks to think about it, and then turned down my partner's request on both counts. His reasons were that, while he recognises my partner's excellent work, he doesn't want to add to the management group, and nor does he feel that he can increase one staff member's salary without offering the same to others, and the organisation can't afford it. My partner feels that this is just an excuse for maintaining the status quo, as there is a history within the organisation of hiring people by word-of-mouth from backgrounds where they do not really need the salary. My partner was the first person to be hired through open recruiting, due to pressure from funders, and was selected for his experience rather than his connections. On the plus side the organisation is supportive of my partner attending professional development events and taking time off when he needs to for his own writing and readings, although he generally takes this as annual leave, or unpaid. There are very few jobs in this field and my partner feels that he is working to the maximum of what is possible in his role, and to the limit of what he can earn with his own writing. We desperately need the increase in salary, as we are struggling to afford to live in what is an expensive part of the country. Jeremy says Behind almost every salary negotiation of this kind, there's an unspoken game of blind man's bluff going on. And it's all to do with the hard realities of the market place. This director clearly values your partner's work and would be sorry to lose him. At the same time, he'll be well aware, as your partner is, that there are very few other jobs in this field of work. So, to be brutal about it, he knows that, by turning down your partner's application for an increase in salary, he's risking little. Your partner is extremely unlikely to hand in his resignation without, at the very least, another conversation. The director will also, and understandably, be concerned about the knock-on effect that any increase in salary might entail. He will assume, probably rightly, that if your partner were granted an increase, however confidentially, others would soon get to know about it. So your partner's hand (as you both already know) is not a strong one \u2013 but I think he can strengthen it by doing two things. First, he needs to make the case that his situation is different from that of others. I can't know what that case could be, but it needs to be based, as much as possible, on fact rather than claim: anything quantifiable, such as length of service, time since last increase, revenue contribution. This will greatly help the director to justify, both to himself and, if necessary, to others, an increase for your partner without opening the floodgates. Second, your partner should tell the director that he accepts his decision for the moment, but would like to raise the matter again formally in, say, six months. This means that the director doesn't have to lose face by changing his mind under immediate pressure and gives him time to make the necessary adjustment. In all respects other than salary, the job seems a good one; too good, perhaps, to jeopardise. Readers say \u2022 I'm not convinced that what your partner has is, in fact, a work problem. Or that he is the one finding it difficult to deal with. He does his job well for the agreed salary. His director doesn't want to favour him with a pay rise, and the organisation can't afford to pay him more. You say your partner feels this is an excuse for maintaining the status quo \u2013 the status quo being that he does the job asked of him for the agreed salary. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but it's not his employer's fault that you need more money. AnneWollenberg \u2022 He's not going to get the pay rise unless the company's organisation changes. He has to try and get on the management team (maybe if someone leaves?), and build alliances with other workers. Many charities are crazy with office politics. What's that saying about academic politics being so bitter because the stakes are so small \u2013 it's the same in the charitable sector. So it should be possible to play the games and reap the rewards. How badly do you want the money? ollienorthern \u2022 Blaming this employee, and their partner, for their own poverty isn't sensible. There is a real problem here that affects many people, so don't kick someone when they are down. The director and trustees must make sure that they are keeping up-to-date with national pay rates and seeking extra funds for increases. artsyfartsy Voluntary redundancy was my only way out. But what do I do next? I have just entered \"voluntary\" redundancy, having spent most of the previous two years working on a part-time basis. Unfortunately, although I was part-time, the work wasn't, resulting in me either working my other hours for nothing (which I did for a while) or not doing my job properly. As a result of the latter option, I ended up stressed to the point that I thought I was heading for a nervous breakdown. My previous manager left and the new one, seeing my obvious distress and the state of the work I had been doing, offered me a way out, so long as I applied for voluntary redundancy. I could see no option other than to agree with him, and took up the offer. Ironically, they have now appointed two people (one full-time, one agency) to do my work. I don't know what to do next. My confidence is shattered and I'm seriously considering taking on an easy job to avoid any repeat of the stress I encountered before. It feels as though I am throwing away over 30 years of experience. Jeremy says You must completely rid yourself of any residual feeling of failure. Hang on to the fact that your last employer has now appointed two people to do the work that you were expected to do \u2013 on your own, and on a part-time basis. This is incontrovertible evidence to yourself, and to others if necessary, that no incompetence or inadequacy on your part was involved; you were simply asked to do the impossible. No one could have done it. This must be the absolutely essential first step you take in rebuilding your confidence. Don't make any irrevocable decisions until that confidence is at least partly back. Perhaps a temporary, low-stress job might be a wise first move. But those 30 years of experience haven't been thrown away: they've just been put on hold for a bit until you're ready to make use of them again. Readers say \u2022 A lot of us have wide swings in confidence over our careers. It's probably a good idea to go back to something you can handle, and that is, ideally, enjoyable. I work with a lot of people who have this \"30 years and now my job's gone\" phase. I always suggest they cut themselves some slack. After that long, you can firmly say your work life has been a success \u2013 whatever happens now \u2013 and you more than deserve a pat on the back for what you achieved. That's how you need to frame it. A rocky patch does not render decades valueless. oommph \u2022 I have taken voluntary redundancy twice, although the second time it was more a case of jumping before I was pushed. Both times it has proved, long term, to be a wholly positive thing. The key is not to dwell on the job you have left, which you didn't enjoy and had probably done for too long. Feel sorry for the those still working for a firm that doesn't appreciate or support them. Think of the time and redundancy money as the opportunity to look for, or train for, something you will really enjoy doing. It may take a while and you may not end up with such a well-paid job at first, but your life will definitely be happier and less stressful than if you had clung to that job. keefo \u2022 For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com.
