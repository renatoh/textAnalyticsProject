Norman Lamb, parliamentary adviser to Nick Clegg, said: \"We listen to the concerns and take them back to government. This is the chance for the party to have its say. We are determined they will have their say.\" Strong support has emerged for an amendment to a motion at this weekend's conference, demanding that the NHS, rather than the private sector, should be the preferred provider in the health service. The amendment also calls for commissioning to remain a public function, \"using the skills and expertise of existing NHS staff rather than subcontracting of commissioning to private companies\". It says commissioning should be made democratically accountable, and not conducted in private by GP commissioners, as proposed in the health bill. The amendment was tabled by Charles West, a health expert in the party, and the former MP Evan Harris, a doctor. It has the support of 133 conference representatives, as well as Graham Winyard, former deputy chief medical officer for England and medical director of the NHS. Winyard is the chair of Winchester Lib Dems. Lady Williams, the former leader of the Lib Dems in the Lords, is also supporting the amendment. An additional amendment has been tabled by the party's policy committee vice-chair, Jeremy Hargreaves, calling for all local health bodies, including foundation trusts and GP commissioners, to be made accountable to local elected authorities. It calls for half of commissioning boards to include local councillors, a change that would deter some private sector firms. Party conference officials will decide tomorrow how to manage what is looking to be a controversial debate on Saturday. The Lib Dem health minister, Paul Burstow, is defending the reforms, saying they are designed to improve standards, increase choice and take clinical decisions closer to patients. He insists he will listen to the party's concerns and take them back to his department. It is not yet clear whether a defeat for the party leadership at the weekend would result in Clegg asking Cameron to rethink or delay the reforms. Speaking at a pre-conference briefing, Lamb said: \"As a party we are totally committed to the NHS. We want to ensure that we protect it. It does need to be reformed, the case for reforms is strong, but we will listen to the concerns and take them back into government. They [activists] now have the chance to influence \u2013 not dictate, but influence.\" Ministers last week moved to address some concerns by making it clear that the government will not allow competition in the NHS based purely on price. It is understood that Clegg is concerned by the revolt, and even his allies admit there are few people in favour of the reforms as a whole. Burstow has been holding a series of telephone conferences with party members to explain the thinking behind the changes. David Cameron has conceded that the public does not yet understand the motives for the shakeup, which includes the abolition of primary care trusts and the handover of the commissioning of \u00a380bn of services to GP consortiums. There have been hints emerging from the NHS commissioning board that the phasing in of GP commissioning could be delayed. There are concerns across the government that the reforms, due to start in April 2013, are being brought in at the same time as massive efficiency savings \u2013 \u00a320bn over four years \u2013 are being sought.Some senior Liberal Democrats argue also added that the coalition tensions on the issue are manageable since the policy was not in the coalition agreement, so no coalition code of honour would be being broken by slowing the policies down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
