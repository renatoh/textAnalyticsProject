The David Arbuthnot-trained gelding looked primed for a major sprint handicap win when an unlucky fourth to Marsad at Newmarket on 2,000 Guineas day in May. Lisianski then had a setback and was off the track until 10 days ago, but though only fifth to Penny Ha'Penny at Newcastle he was reported by paddock judges to be just in need of the run. The selection loves fast ground and is well handicapped on his best form, being a stone better off with the well-fancied Peruvian Chief for a length beating in the Newmarket race. YORK 2.05: This is completely wide open and Malarkey, who may have found his latest run coming just too quickly after a cheeky win at Sandown, gets a very tentative vote. BANGOR 2.15: Martin Pipe has campaigned Dream With Me in typically clever fashion and even though his runner is on a four-timer he still looks very fairly treated on his handicap debut. ASCOT 2.20: Sir Michael Stoute's two-year-olds invariably improve for their first run and Adekshan, the subject of good gallops reports and an entrant in both the Dewhust Stakes and Racing Post Trophy, could beat opponents with the more proven form. YORK 2.35: Tim Easterby firmly believes that his Cumbrian Venture would surely have gone close to winning the Doncaster St Leger meeting sales race won by Somnus with a better draw and the form of that contest could not have worked out better. ASCOT 2.50: This is very tight, but the lightning fast Speed Cop, who was a good third to Wunders Dream in the Flying Childers at Doncaster last month from a poor draw, may prove hard to catch on this ground and turn the tables on Revenue this time. YORK 3.05: The in-form Blue Velve t, an excellent second in the Ayr Silver Cup, rates a decent bet in a sprint handicap that is far less competitive than most of its kind. BANGOR 3.20: Not a race to get too heavily involved in but Maxie McDonald stays the trip, acts on the ground and ran a promising race first time out this term. ASCOT 3.25: Lady's Secret may be found out by the firm ground again leaving the way clear for Love Everlasting, who has two ways of running but is clearly the best of the rest on form. YORK 3.40: Magic Glade, from the in-form Roger Charlton yard, has more scope than most of these and met a useful sort when second to Greenslades at Ascot last time. YORK 4.10: Those drawn low have an advantage on the round course here and Satyr should go well. However, Kieren Fallon has deserted that one for Blue Star, who proved he stays this trip when third over an extended 10 furlongs last time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
