The Scot has backed away from making provocative comments before tonight's match but it is clear that he will lead his team to Highbury believing they can take the moral high ground. Subtlety has never been Ferguson's strongest point and his intentions were clear as he spoke at length about United's impressive disciplinary record. By implication the point he was trying to make is that Arsenal have been to blame for many of the unsavoury incidents that have tarnished the fixture over the past decade. \"I've no fears about there being any problems and that's because my players behave themselves properly,\" he said. \"They always do. They have a good discipline record and that requires good discipline within themselves and from the management of the club.\" Though recognising that there is \"something unusual\" about the build-up to this fixture, Ferguson rejected any notion that the caustic atmosphere would unsettle his players. This is a side who attract hostility wherever they go and the Scot does not regard Highbury as one of the more voluble grounds in the country. \"In terms of hostility our boys have faced far more hostile atmospheres,\" he said. \"When you go to Anfield, Liverpool versus Manchester United, and they play that song [You'll Never Walk Alone] the hairs on the back of your neck stand up and it really gets you motivated. And as for Leeds United at Elland Road ... deary me!\" Ferguson's primary concern is the 11-point gap with Chelsea at the top. \"They will be praying it's a draw,\" he said. \"They look as if they have an unassailable lead but you keep thinking about football being the game that can suddenly change. \"There have been disasters time and time again. I had it as a player at Rangers when we went unbeaten to the last day of the season, only to lose the final game 3-2 to Aberdeen and then concede the title to Celtic. Can you imagine how the Rangers fans felt that day? \"Football is a game which can defy all your optimism and we will keep on chasing Chelsea until we can't catch them. You have to hope that the disaster of all disasters happens and they collapse. I'm not managing the right club if I don't think like that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
