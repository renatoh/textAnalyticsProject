The Secret Intelligence Service, which has traditionally scoured the country's elite universities for recruits, launched a series of online adverts this month as part of its attempts to attract people from a variety of backgrounds. \"A number of public channels are used to promote job opportunities in the organisation and Facebook is a recent example of this,\" said a Foreign Office spokeswoman. MI6 runs agents in foreign countries and says it wants its officers to \"reflect the society\" they serve. Before 2006 most recruits joined after getting a tap on the shoulder while studying at a leading university. But since then the organisation has run newspaper and radio adverts. Those on Facebook have already generated a lot of interest. \"There has been a very good response so far,\" said a spokeswoman. The three adverts pop up as users of the social networking site contact each other. One, aimed at those with a university background, reads: \"Graduates of all ages can develop long-term careers as operational officers, collecting and analysing global intelligence.\" Another is targeted at those who are bored with their jobs. \"Time for a career change? MI6 can use your skills. Join us as an operational officer collecting and analysing global intelligence to protect the UK.\" The final advert offers potential applicants an influential place in global history. It says: \"A career in world events? Help influence world events, protect the UK. Operational officer roles collecting and analysing global intelligence.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
