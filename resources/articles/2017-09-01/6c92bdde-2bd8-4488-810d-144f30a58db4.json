With speculation in Canberra mounting that the Labor premier will shortly call an election in Queensland, the prime minister will head to the state on Wednesday, missing his rival Bill Shorten by just hours. The opposition leader just wrapped up a two-day visit to the sunshine state selling Labor\u2019s $1bn tourism plan, flying out as Turnbull flies in. But where the opposition leader sought to better promote one of the state\u2019s best features \u2013 its endless sunshine \u2013 Turnbull is focused on energy, vowing north Queensland will receive a new power station under his government, if the LNP leader, Tim Nicholls, pulls off an election win. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to Tim Nicholls, who I hope will be the next premier of Queensland, about the potential for a new advanced high-efficient low-emission power station,\u201d Turnbull told 4BC radio on Tuesday. \u201cIf Tim becomes premier, and the state decides to build one. \u201cObviously there is a substantial amount of funds in our northern Australia infrastructure fund, that is available for infrastructure. A power station ticks that box. It is definitely infrastructure. \u201cIt would be completely depend on an LNP state government, because Annastacia Palaszczuk, for reasons she could perhaps explain, is absolutely opposed to any further investment in coal-fired energy in Queensland, despite the fact Queensland has enormous coal resources it is exporting to the world.\u201d The NAIF, the jewel in Tony Abbott\u2019s plan to see northern Australia become an \u201ceconomic powerhouse\u201d, is administered by an independent body which has access to $5bn in concessional loans. The structure of the fund keeps the $5bn off the government\u2019s books, with the government only accountable for monies lent. So far, the fund has approved no projects, prompting a rethink on how it is used. The focus on Queensland by both federal leaders underscores the importance of the state where at least 11 federal electorates are considered to be in play. Turnbull, making sure to mention it was his 11th visit to the state this year, plans on spending his time with some of his more popular MPs, including Brisbane\u2019s Trevor Evans, who bucked the trend in the last election and increased the party\u2019s margin, despite replacing a retiring member. Shorten, who has made more than 15 visits to the state this year, headed north, where he discussed infrastructure, jobs and investment in new industries, concentrating on areas that continue to exceed the nation\u2019s unemployment average as the resources slowdown continues to bite. Pauline Hanson also took advantage of the break in Canberra proceedings to head straight to her home state, selling her message in the south-east before a $995 a-head fundraiser \u2013 which lands just under the state\u2019s $1,000 donation disclosure law. All eyes are on George Street, where Palaszczuk will make the decision on when to hold the election, widely tipped for either November or February. But a boundary redistribution, an additional four seats, the introduction of compulsory preferential voting and the resurgence of One Nation have complicated matters. Neither major party is seen as guaranteed to win the now-necessary 47 seats needed for power in the unicameral parliament. Queensland is considered the state to win at the next federal election. Both major parties are convinced a victory in the north will pave the way to Canberra."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
