Not bad as excuses go. The thing is, Valencia had been kept waiting by his majesty in their request to have an audience to celebrate their Spanish Cup (called the King's Cup) win of 1999. A merry old king is Juan Carlos of Spain, generally having the life of Riley dashing from one sporting event to another, and invariably there on the scene at the venue of any Spanish sporting success story. Back at the palace, the king met every player and engaged in a long conversation with coach Hector Cuper. Perhaps the king was keen to know if there would be a return to a double holding role in midfield for the away leg in Leeds - maybe he even got the parlance right: Mister - (Spain's coaches are always referred to as El Mister in homage to football's English roots) how about double pivots? - with Angulo suspended and Mendieta moving back to the right from his link-up duties, or are 'we' dispensing with the back-four? Valencia have made great strides and the locals are hopeful that their team can follow where Deportivo have led, and open a third front to challenge the hegemony of Spain's big two clubs, Barcelona and Real. Unbelievably, Cuper, who guided their team to its first ever final in Europe's biggest competition last year, is leaving at the end of the season, just because of the fans, alleging that he cannot even come off the bench to issue instructions as he is jeered so much. Think about it, in your first season you take your side to a European Cup final and though the club president wants you to stay, you decide to go, bemoaning the lack of love from fans. I was warned about Cuper's prickly nature, but I found him generous in the time and details he gave to answers, knowledgeable about English football, lyrical about Leeds and only blunt about the difficulty of the task ahead. He laughed about the ignorance of the Argentine immigration officer who spelled the surname of his English great-grandfather wrong, could not recall the name of the city the previous Mr Cooper had left, despite having traced his family roots, and enjoyed discovering the origin of his family name. He shrugged off the fans' disenchantment with him as 'Things that happen in the world of football, I take it on board', claiming that he stayed within the confines of the dugout to avoid the reception affecting the team. 'But I'd like to be liked,' he admitted. Cuper has watched Leeds on video and made a virtue of their youth and dynamism. How they keep their shape and always play the same pattern, much as Valencia do, and emphasised how their belief and experience will have grown along with their progress. 'Perhaps they don't have the quality, talented individuals of Arsenal, but they have more talent as a team. Leeds will be thinking, \"We're now one of the best four or five teams in Europe\". It's as up front as that.' Wasn't it time he actually won a cup final, having lost three in succession since moving to Europe with Mallorca? 'I wouldn't say exactly I've got something to prove,' Cuper said. 'Not many even get the chance of finals. Then, something big like the Champions League comes along and winning it is a very significant inner satisfaction, and not just because it looks good on the CV but because it's personally satisfying.' valencia are desperate to make it to the final again. Last season's defeat, particularly at the hands of a domestic rival, Real Madrid, has left a sour taste.The players, unlike Cuper, see the away leg as key, and highlight Leeds' organisation - what Didier Deschamps calls a 'good collective' - and admit that another 3-0 result in the home leg would deliver a knockout blow. Very visible from a distance is the louche figure of Santi Ca\u00f1izares - a Spanish version of David Beckham, albeit between the sticks - complete with Day-Glo blond hair and flash, up-to-the-minute, jazzy gear. Is the recently restored Spain No1, ready for all that Kewell, Viduka, Smith et al are ready to throw at him? 'No problem,' he swaggers, 'they won't cause us any more problems than the other two English sides.' During this week's audience at the palace, it emerged that the club had not invited the king to a league game as they would 'prefer him to come to Milan' for the Champions League final. It is up to Leeds to put his nibs in a position where the monarch might have to put country before club, and cheer on the other Madrid team in May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
