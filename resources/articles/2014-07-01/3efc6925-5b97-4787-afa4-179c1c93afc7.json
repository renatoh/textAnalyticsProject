It went back to Lineker\u2019s days at Barcelona when he was asked to play alongside Maradona in a Rest of the World team against a Football League XI. \u201cEvery player was in awe,\u201d Lineker recalled. \u201cHe just had this unbelievable presence. \u201cHe got bored and walked out on to the pitch for the warm-up, juggling the ball all the way to the halfway line, and then he just booted the ball about 50 yards into the sky and it came straight down on his foot. Then he booted it again into the air. He did it about 12 times and never had to do anything other than walk. It was unbelievable. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound that great but, when we got back to Barcelona, all the players tried it and the best anyone could do was three. He was unbelievable, by a million miles the best player I played with or against. It\u2019s not meant as a pun but his left foot could manipulate the ball as if it were a hand.\u201d And Messi? Lineker, the golden boot winner of the 1986 tournament, was effusive about the Barcelona player in the early games of this tournament. Now, however, he believes there might be something troubling him before Sunday\u2019s final. \u201cI love Messi and he is the most wonderfully gifted player I have seen since Maradona,\u201d Lineker said. \u201cBut I have been marginally disappointed. There is something not right. He has become very static. I went to the semi-final [against Holland] in S\u00e3o Paulo and watched him closely and there is so little movement now. \u201cI saw a quote from his father saying that he\u2019s exhausted and his legs weigh 100kg and it looks a bit like that.\u201d Lineker continued: \u201cHe has done magical things at this World Cup and he is largely responsible for them being in the final but he looks jaded to me.\u201d Lineker does, however, have sympathy for Messi. \u201cMaradona is a huge personality. He must be a tough act to follow.\u201d Gary Lineker presents the World Cup final, live from 7pm on Sunday on BBC1"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
