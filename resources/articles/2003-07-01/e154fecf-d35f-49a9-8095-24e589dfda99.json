Where, they ask, is the guile, the willingness to risk being hit for the chance to embarrass? Giles, who does what he is asked to do as well as anyone, has tailored his trajectory and line to the requirements of his team, his captain and his central contract, which is admirable - but it has robbed him of a large part of his craft. Writing 14 years ago, Phil Edmonds confessed in looking back on an uneven career: 'In retrospect I wish I had used more frequently the classical method of slow left-arm bowling, spreading out the fielders and tempting the batsman to drive. But I became stereotyped, as one often does in county cricket, and pushed the ball through.' Not a lot has changed. Elsewhere, though, the traditions of slow bowling are valued more highly and, from India last week, came encouraging news from an unlikely source. Jagmohan Dalmiya, president of the Board of Cricket Control of India, announced in that magisterial way of his, 'There will be no more one-day competitions for junior players in India.' The thinking behind the decision is to prevent the very problem that besets English cricket: slow bowlers turning into one-day machines, dart-merchants who have forgotten how to flight the ball. Dalmiya went on the advice of the most distinguished panel of slow bowlers you could wish to assemble: Bishan Bedi, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Erapalli Prasanna and Srinivas Venkataraghavan. Anyone who saw this quartet operating as a unit will not easily forget the alchemy of art and magic they brought to their discipline. Ian Chappell cites Prasanna as the best off-spinner he faced; Gary Sobers thought Chandra, the finest purveyor of top-spinners and googlies despite his bowling arm being shrivelled by polio since the age of nine, the most dangerous he played against; Bedi, by common consent, was the cleverest and most attacking of all modern left-armers and Venkat was always there to push Prasanna for the off-spinner's job (he still squeezed in 57 Tests between 1965 and 1983). By any reckoning that is a group of slow bowlers worth listening to. It was their view that limited-overs cricket was robbing young Indian spinners of the traditional ways, it was turning them into automatons scared for their place in the team rather than looking to impose themselves on a match. 'We've accepted the spin panel's advice that one-dayers tend to push young bowlers into a defensive shell,' Dalmiya said. Not that they will be loop-obsessed tricksters. The game has moved on. There have been many good changes in spin bowling, most obviously those subtleties used by Saqlain Mushtaq for Pakistan (when the selectors are not leaving him out for who knows what reason) and Surrey, and Muttiah Muralitharan, the Sri Lankan genius in pursuit of Shane Warne's records. All of them swap tricks, as Warne revealed a while ago. There are now more variations in delivery than ever, balls shooting out from under the palm, zooters and flippers, the traditional wrong'un and several others that defy easy analysis. Very few of these modern geniuses, though, trust the ball to be in the air for too long. The attacking line now is invariably flat, wobbling a little sometimes, and usually on or about middle and off stump. Otherwise, as in Giles's case in the one-day internationals, they are slanted sharply across from over the wicket, tight, defensive bowling that relies on the batsman getting bored with milking the bowler for three or four an over. It is easy to forget the beauty of attacking slow bowling and how many good ones there were. Edmonds, in his book 100 Greatest Bowlers, says of the Bedi era, for instance: 'India in the 1960s and 1970s had left-arm spinners every bit as good as Bedi on helpful pitches, although names like Goel and Shivalkar mean little to followers outside India. Where Bedi was superb was in his ability to attack and take wickets - four per Test on average - when everything was in the batsman's favour.' And the medium he used was the air. Releasing the ball from a variety of points above his strong left shoulder, he planted doubt, then confusion, in the batsman's mind. When he had him set up, he would then get his killer ball to bite harder and faster than the others, either going with the arm into his pads or spitting past him towards slip and likely to catch the edge of a nervously-held bat. It was a joy to watch. While Bedi seemed to float to the bowling crease, he had to spend long hours in the nets to hit a natural rhythm on command and used yoga for suppleness. That is not to say modern spinners don't work as hard. They do. But they work on containment and grinding down batsmen, not to mention laps and diets. There is no recorded instance in the history of cricket of a batsman being dismissed by a calorie chart. During the winter, I watched Ashley Mallett working with Jim Troughton on his occasional left-arm spin at the Adelaide nets of the England academy. The emphasis was in ensuring the ball went above the horizontal sightline of the batsman's eye. This guaranteed a simple result: the batsman had no choice but to adjust his focus up and down as well as long or short. It takes courage to bowl spin at the highest level against quality batsmen. It takes even more to do it slowly. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
