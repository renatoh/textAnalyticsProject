But users who fail to understand what their service offers could end up out of pocket - and even without access to the internet. Website uSwitch.com, which runs a broadband price comparison and switching service, says that large numbers of users are failing to shop around for packages, with 43 per cent taking up an offer from their existing telecoms provider. It's not surprising people take the easy option. With more than 100 internet service providers (ISPs) offering a variety of differently structured packages at various prices, broadband is as complicated to get to grips with as mobile phone tariffs. Essentially, you can sign up to two main types of tariff: the more common unmetered version - for which you pay a flat monthly fee - or choose from a growing variety of metered, 'pay as you go' packages. Metered packages vary greatly but usually allow you a certain bandwidth (or amount of usage, expressed in gigabytes) for your monthly fee. Using more can be costly, with providers tending to take one of three tactics. Some will charge you for the additional bandwidth you have used at, typically, \u00a31.50 or \u00a32 per extra gigabyte used. Others will contact you to warn you or force you to upgrade your package, while a few will reduce your speed and put you on a restricted bandwidth or even stop your service. Andy Dewhurst, chief executive of Tesco Telecoms, which offers an unmetered package with no download limit, says that it is important people check whether they are in fact signing up for unlimited access when they opt for a flat-fee package. 'Many internet users are continuing to use broadband with the expectation that there is a one-off monthly charge, but once limits are reached the bills start racking up,' he says. According to uSwitch, the cheapest package from its panel of 40 ISPs for a package without download restrictions would cost \u00a312.99 a month for a light user - or around \u00a325 for a heavy user. Working out whether you are a light, medium or heavy user might not be as easy as you think. Downloading music or photographs tends to bump up your usage considerably. Virgin recommends its \u00a317.99 Broadband Two package (3gb per month plus \u00a32 for every additional gb) for people who download a few photos and listen to music online, but its unlimited \u00a324.99 per month Broadband One package for those downloading large music or video files. Jon Miller, director at uSwitch.com, says users should also consider speed of connection. Some users may not benefit from the fastest speeds because of the quality of the lines and the distance between the customer and the exchange. You can check your connection speed for free online at independent broadband ISP review site www.adslguide.org.uk. Sebastien Lahtinen, co-founder of ADSLguide, says that the cost of the newer metered packages has come down over the last year, making them particularly attractive for lighter users. If you end up choosing a service that involves a contract, Lahtinen urges caution over signing up for a long period just in case you are not happy with the package. 'Many providers do have a 12-month contract but many others offer a three- or even one-month contract.' On top of the usage fee, for any service, you will also need to pay an installation fee - typically between \u00a350 and \u00a375 - and you may have to buy the necessary hardware. Some ISPs provide this, which works out cheaper and you should also get help with installation. Switching between broadband providers is still in its infancy, but in theory if your contract is coming to an end this should be straightforward. As of last August, a number of broadband suppliers signed up to a voluntary code of practice designed to eliminate delays in 'migrating' to another provider. The new system works in much the same way as changing a mobile phone provider, in this case using a number known as a migration authority code (MAC). Once this number has been passed between providers, transfer should resume without interruption to your service. Big names such as BT, AOL, Virgin and Wanadoo have signed up to this agreement, but a number of other providers - including Tiscali - have not. If you want to swap from one of these other providers you will have to cancel your connection with your current provider and register with the new one. This can take longer than you think - up to two months is not unheard-of - and will cost you more in installation fees; migration costs as little as \u00a311. If you remain confused, find out about other people's experiences by talking to friends who have broadband and checking out the chat forums on sites such as adslguide.org.uk. And talk to the providers. This is particularly important if you have a Mac rather than a PC, because not all providers offer support services for Mac users."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
