The flamboyant performer tells us why he'll sacrifice anything to get it back. Why is the cape so special? It was the first piece of costume I commissioned for my album The Bachelor \u2013 from a designer called Aida Zanditon. For the track \"Vulture\" I wanted to become a human vulture, quite cadaverous. That single's about being so deep in your depression that you're waiting for a vulture to come and take the dead parts, which is quite hard to channel, so the cape is like a ritual piece. I normally wear it with a bondage-style headpiece, leather shirt and trousers \u2013 not in a YMCA way, but in a primeval, warrior sense. Put together, it feels like I'm fighting a war. Even if you're drinking a Pimm's in the sunshine this outfit makes you feel like roaring. Where do you think it is? It went missing with a pair of size 12 black patent stilettos from backstage at the Underage festival. Someone must've tea-leafed those two things. It's funny to think there's a 12 year-old somewhere in stilettos and a \u00a32,000 couture cape but it's broken my heart because it's irreplaceable. What would you like to say to whoever's got it? I'll swap it for anything! A bit of vintage Vivienne Westwood or one of my homemade outfits. I'll cook you dinner or play you a song. What else are you up to? I'm touring and finishing my fifth album. I've worked through my dark folk energy and I'm writing pop songs again. Watching all these young pop upstarts on their first single I think, \"Wait until you see what Granddad can do.\" \u2022 Patrick Wolf plays the London Palladium on 15 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
