There is a clear answer: we can thank/blame California. In 1990, the town of San Luis Obispo became the first place in the world to ban smoking in all public buildings. Now Calabasas - population 23,000, \"gateway to the Santa Monica Mountains\", \"proud to be a smoke-free city\" - has stepped things up: as of Friday, visitors and residents can no longer light up \"where anyone might be exposed to second-hand smoke\". So, it's goodbye to most of tobacco's last redoubts: al fresco restaurant tables, parks, bus stops ... even the balconies of smokers' own homes or cars (unless the windows are tightly closed). This is all thanks to Calabasas's five-member city council, whose pioneering zeal is embodied by one Barry Groveman, an environmental lawyer who also serves as mayor. \"This is the right time and the right place to take this step,\" he says.\"We hope it will be the way things are done all over the country and all over the world.\" So could such a draconian ramping up eventually happen here? \"In some outdoor environments, like football grounds and railway stations, there is genuine cause for concern,\" says Deborah Arnott, of the anti-smoking group Action on Smoking and Health. \"But in other places, there are pretty obvious facts about air circulation which mean the potential for harm is far less. Certainly, stopping people smoking in their homes is taking things a bit far.\" OK, but let us briefly adopt the Californian position. What if someone sparks up on their balcony, there's a big gust of wind and some hapless person 50 yards away is hit by a very diluted puff of smoke? You may as well put in a call to the undertakers there and then, eh? \"You've got to get this issue down to what's reasonable and sensible,\" Arnott says, with a very British kind of pragmatism. \"That's an extreme, fundamentalist position. And I don't think we're that kind of country, are we?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
