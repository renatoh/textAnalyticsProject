David Cameron has secured obvious credit for settling early on a policy of legal, multilateral intervention and sticking to it. \"Loose talk,\" people said when he first broached it. In the Commons last Friday MPs lathered him in bilious praise. They will do so again on Monday. But no one can be sure where the policy will lead. Inside government, determination \u2013 not optimism \u2013 is the watchword. It applies to Libya and even more so to the domestic event of the week: the budget. There is steady certainty at the top, if not below, that the government is either doing the right thing or anyway has no alternative, and that either way it must not change course. However immediately challenging the struggle, the two parties really are all in it together. \"On Libya, the most ardent and the most sceptical ministers in the cabinet are both Conservatives,\" a Tory minister points out \u2013 with Liberal Democrats as persuaded as anyone. \"The cabinet is more united around more issues of principle than any under Tony Blair.\" An exaggeration perhaps, but not absurd. Talking to ministers and backbenchers from both parties over the last few days, I have been struck by their bloody-minded resolve. While opinion polls and the May elections are alarming, they are not an internal obsession. The coalition is holding firm on its five-year march to redemption or perdition. It is true that cuts only start properly this spring; that the political and economic consequences are incalculable; and that everyone thinks the polls will get worse. Nor do you even need to scratch the surface to find Lib Dem unease: a search for what even Nick Clegg has called \"positive differentiation\". But Ed Balls's empty and stumbling performance on the BBC on Sunday suggests the government needs to be less immediately afraid than recent commentary suggests. \"Balls doesn't have the power to blow your house down unless you let him,\" says one Tory. \"Stop now on deficit reduction and people will think you are cruel, arbitrary and flaky.\" Among Lib Dems there is no serious thought of changing course on cuts. \"Breaking the spending envelope would make you look feeble and make the markets say you are not serious,\" says one. \"The spending trajectory is partly science, but it is a pretty imperfect science,\" says another, in the cabinet. \"If we changed plans now, in the face of a downgrade, but a fairly modest downgrade, the spiral effect would be considerable: political turmoil, economic uncertainty, almost certainly a spike in the bond market. Attention would refocus on the gargantuan size of the structural deficit. It would pull the veil away.\" So the budget was all but settled last Thursday, in a co-operative process that leaves officials who remember Gordon Brown gasping. George Osborne wants to move his focus from rescue to reform and may yet end up at ruin and regret \u2013 but there is no desperation, and an expectation that the worst news has been announced. The budget will neither give nor take more away, restricting the chancellor's ability to compensate people hit by the cost of living \u2013 politically more toxic than cuts to the public sector. It will push for growth by simplifying regulation, but that is as economically effective as it is unmarketable. Popular or not, the budget will not break the government. The event that matters least to the public is the one that will test the coalition the most: the AV referendum. Whatever happens, one part of the government will soon feel defeated and trapped. Leading Lib Dems say with some glee that Cameron is now \"panicking\" about the chances of a positive vote \u2013 and the mutinous Tory response that might follow, piling on top of boundary changes that few welcome and that will force all MPs to reapply for their seats. On the Tory side, fear of AV varies, one minister saying he supports the intellectual case and had considered backing it. But he is an exception. It is impossible to be overly hyperbolic about the transforming consequences of a yes vote for the Lib Dems. In a stroke it would redeem Clegg, which is why before 5 May he intends to go all out as a public supporter of the campaign. He judges silence more damaging than the jeers that follow him everywhere. All three leaders expected to stand back from the campaign. All three are being dragged in. The chance of success only hardens the knock the Lib Dems will take if the vote is lost. Plans are being made: Cameron and Clegg are said to be \"attuned to what they need to do for each other\", whatever the outcome. If defeated, Lib Dems will be offered Lords reform and will speak up sharply on the NHS. But the disappointment would be immense, and in that lies the possibility of an explosion (however self-defeating) of hostility between the two parties \u2013 if not at the top of government, then a little lower down. In recent months it has been easy to imagine the coalition has lost its way. It hasn't. So far, the resolve is undimmed. The lid is firmly on, but from beneath the pressure has built. A premature loss of nerve \u2013 and only a premature loss of nerve \u2013 could blow things apart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
