The former South Africa captain, who has been at the club for more than five years, announced his decision yesterday in the wake of defeats in their past three matches, all at home. \"As a club, Saracens is growing in many areas but this is not being matched by results on the field,\" said Pienaar. \"I have to take full responsibility: it has become apparent to me that the team needs a fresh face and a new voice to take it forward. It has been a difficult decision, all the more so because I have developed a deep commitment to the club.\" Pienaar this week hired the assistant Springbok coach Tim Lane on a temporary basis. The South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) agreed to loan Lane to Saracens for two weeks but he will now become a candidate to succeed Pienaar. Lane is contracted to Sarfu until the end of next year's World Cup but with South Africa interviewing for a national coach to succeed Harry Viljoen, Lane could find himself surplus to requirements. Pienaar did not apply for the South Africa job and he was not headhunted. Dissenting voices on Sarfu are angry that only candidates who applied for the post were interviewed and there is speculation that the selection process could be overhauled, which would put Pienaar back in the frame. \"I am committed to the Springboks for the duration of my contract,\" Lane said. \"But whether I stay on is not really my decision: it will depend on the new coach and I have to look at other options.\" His immediate task will be to help Saracens, who have lost seven of their last 10 league matches, to ease their relegation worries with a win over Leeds at Vicarage Road tomorrow week. Saracens' owner, Nigel Wray, said: \"It is immensely frustrating for Francois and for the club that his great efforts have not been rewarded by more success on the field. He has been instrumental in our transformation from what was essentially an amateur park team into a model, innovative and professional rugby club. He will help co-ordinate the search for a new coach to ensure a smooth and seamless transition.\" Bridgend are also looking for a head coach following the resignation of Dennis John. Like Saracens, they have invested heavily on the playing side without seeing any significant improvement in terms of results and they are also well adrift of Heineken Cup qualification for next season. The former Newport director of rugby and assistant Wales coach Allan Lewis will take charge at the Brewery Field until the end of the season and Bridgend have asked the Welsh Rugby Union's rugby director Terry Cobner to help them find John's successor. \"We will be advertising the post globally but we would ideally like a Welshman to take charge,\" said the Bridgend chief executive Adrian Hadley. \"We will be asking Terry Cobner for his advice and given the players we have at the Brewery Field, coupled with the improvement in our facilities, we expect a big response.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
