Her husband's military ward-mate insinuates himself into the Cooks' home and offers Pearlie an unusual bargain. The book offers a dark view of America's awkward interregnum between the end of the Second World War and the full-scale escalation of the cold war and Greer's eye for period detail is acute: descriptions of corsets, cabinets and soda cans provide a refreshing change from the usual procession of sleek black Chevies. Less convincing is the high-register rendering of Pearlie's voice and Greer's irritating habit of reserving revelations for the last sentence of a chapter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
