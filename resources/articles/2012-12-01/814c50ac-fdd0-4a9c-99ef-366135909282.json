Newstribune.com said: \"A 23-year-old man was shot dead and three others injured early Sunday morning, according to Sumner Police. Police say the men, construction workers from California, were smoking in the parking lot of the Sumner Motor Inn on Main Street at 12:30am Sunday. Two men drove up, opened fire and sped off. Three men are being treated for gunshot wounds at Tacoma General Hospital. Two of the men are in stable condition. The third required surgery. His condition is unknown at this time. Police say the victims did not know the suspects.\" \u2022 On Saturday, east of Birmingham, Alabama, police shot and killed a man \u2013 later identified as 33-year-old Romero Roberto Moya \u2013 who was armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, at the end of a pursuit that began with a triple killing in Cleburne County, authorities said. Neighbors reported hearing gunshots at a mobile home park in Heflin and summoned police around 10am. Investigator Dennis Green of the Cleburne County Sheriff's Office said the three gunshot victims were males but that authorities were uncertain of their ages. Green said a child younger than age 2 had been injured, and taken to a Georgia hospital. A police pursuit ensued and wound into Oxford, where the man crashed a car. A spokesman said the suspect fired at police with an AK-47, wounding one officer. That officer was reported to be in critical condition Saturday night. Authorities said the suspect then carjacked a vehicle, though the occupants were able to escape. Police caught up with the suspect in nearby Coldwater, where he crashed his car into another vehicle. The suspect then reached for the assault rifle as he exited the car. Two members of an Oxford police Swat team fatally shot him at around 12:40pm, authorities said. \u2022 Also in Birmingham, Alabama on Saturday, authorities said Jason Letts, 38, of Jemison opened fire at a hospital, wounding a police officer and two employees before he was shot and killed by another officer. Letts was later reported to have been upset regarding his wife's treatment at the St Vincent's Hospital, where police were sent around 4am. Two officers who arrived separately converged on the suspect on the hospital's fifth floor. \"When the officer encountered the suspect, there was immediate gunfire from the suspect,\" Birmingham Police sergeant Johnny Williams said. He said detectives were still trying to establish a motive. Hospital spokeswoman Liz Moore said the hospital was secure and stable, and patient care had not been interrupted. \u2022 Authorities in Indiana said Sunday that a man who had 47 guns and ammunition in his Cedar Lake home had been arrested after allegedly threatening to kill people at a local elementary school. Police were called to the home of 60-year-old Von I Meyer early Friday, after he allegedly threatened to set his wife on fire. A police statement says Meyer also said he would enter Jane Ball Elementary School and \"kill as many people as he could\". Authorities found 47 guns and ammunition worth more than $100,000. Prosecutors filed felony intimidation charges against Meyer on Saturday. He is being held without bond. \u2022 A man was arrested after firing about 50 shots in the parking lot of a Southern California shopping mall, prompting a lockdown of stores crowded with holiday shoppers. Marcos Gurrola, 42, of Garden Grove was taken into custody by bicycle police officers patrolling the open-air Fashion Island mall around 4.30pm Saturday, a police spokeswoman said. She said he fired into the air and onto the ground in the parking lot near a Macy's department store. No one was injured, but the gunfire caused panic. Gurrola was arrested for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon, authorities said. \u2022 In Missouri, Gary Sancegrow, 30, was charged with first-degree murder over the shooting on Saturday of Christopher R Parsons, a 31-year-old Washington County deputy sheriff. Parsons was shot and killed while responding to an emergency call early about an unconscious person near Mineral Point, a community of about 350 residents southwest of St Louis. Parsons was shot with a rifle as emergency crews loaded the unconscious person into an ambulance. Sancegrow was subsequently arrested without a struggle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
