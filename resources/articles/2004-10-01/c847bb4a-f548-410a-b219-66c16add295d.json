The three-year-old was one of Channon's two winners at Newcastle on Sunday when Bibury Flyer completed the stable's treble with a victory at the Curragh. Seneschal (2.00) carries a 6lb penalty but that looks far from harsh for his easy Newcastle win and the trainer is striking quickly before his gelding is reassessed by the handicapper. The selection ran only twice as a two-year-old, winning his final race of that term by six lengths at Windsor. He was then off for nearly a year with the view of allowing him to mature. Seneschal gave a hint of returning to top form when fifth at Newbury last month and then confirmed that effort with his win at Newcastle on Sunday. Alrafidain (2.30) showed plenty of promise on his debut at Newmarket last month when fourth to Pevensey an any further improvement should see him home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
