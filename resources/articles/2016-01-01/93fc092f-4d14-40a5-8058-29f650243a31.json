The US defence secretary Ash Carter will meet in Paris with counterparts from the UK, Australia, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands on Wednesday to discuss broadening the campaign against Isis. Conservatives have seized on Canada\u2019s exclusion from the list to accuse the Liberal government \u2013 and in particular the prime minister, foreign minister Stephane Dion and defence minister Harjit Sajjan \u2013 of sidelining Canada from the fight against Isis. \u201cBecause of the weak response that we\u2019re seeing from Prime Minister Trudeau and mixed messages and incoherence coming from Stephane Dion and Harjit Sajjan, the allies aren\u2019t taking us seriously anymore,\u201d said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. In his first news conference after a sweeping election victory in October, Trudeau pledged to withdraw the country\u2019s fighter jets from operations against Isis in Iraq and Syria while increasing contributions to the campaign\u2019s training and humanitarian efforts. But the government has yet to elaborate on the details of their plan. \u201cThe decision to withdraw Canada\u2019s CF-18s is seen by our allies as stepping back, rather than standing shoulder-to-shoulder with them,\u201d said Bezan. Earlier this week, Sajjan downplayed the fact he would not attend the meeting, noting that he had multiple upcoming meetings with Nato allies, including in Brussels in February. A State Department official said on Tuesday the talks were not a formal coalition gathering but a one-time meeting of defence ministers. Asked about Canada\u2019s exclusion, the official said: \u201cThe United States and Canada are great friends and allies, and together with coalition partners, we will continue to work to degrade and destroy Isil.\u201d Speaking last at Kentucky\u2019s Fort Campbell military base, Carter said the six nations invited to the talks are \u201cplaying a significant role in both the ground and air components\u201d of the campaign and have a \u201csignificant stake in the destruction of Isis\u201d. Carter also noted he would push for greater involvement from current and prospective members in the fight. On Tuesday, the Washington Post story quoted a senior US administration defence official describing the talks as a meeting of nations with \u201cthe most skin in the game together\u201d. The US is seeking more military contributions from its allies in the wake of deadly terror attacks linked to the extremist group in Paris in November and San Bernardino in December. For the moment, six Canadian CF-18 fighter jets are still conducting sorties in Iraq and Syria. Canada is also contributing two surveillance craft and one refuelling tanker to coalition efforts, along with 600 military personnel and 69 special forces who are advising and assisting local forces. Of the countries attending the Paris meeting, only Germany is not involved in airstrikes in Iraq or Syria, although it is flying reconnaissance missions in support of the coalition in the region. In July, under the former Conservative government, Canada hosted an anti-Isis coalition conference co-chaired by the US and Iraq."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
