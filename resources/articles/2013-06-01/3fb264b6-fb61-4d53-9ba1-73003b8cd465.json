In a move that runs counter to efforts to cut borrowing, the prime minister is to sanction a small increase in the \u00a3200m reinvestment and reform initiative that supports community relations. The extra spending, to be announced by Cameron at a meeting in Downing Street with Northern Ireland's first and deputy first minister Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness, will be allowed if the executive delivers on its commitment to bring down the walls over the next 10 years. The prime minister, who has summoned Robinson and McGuinness to Downing Street ahead of the G8 summit in Co Fermanagh next week, said: \"Next week in Fermanagh, we will show the world an increasingly outward-looking Northern Ireland, that is open for business and focusing on the steps it needs to take to succeed in the global race. \"This agreement is a symbol of our ambitious vision for Northern Ireland \u2013 a genuinely shared society that is fulfilling its economic potential and strengthening the foundations for peace, stability and prosperity.\" The peace walls were built in response to calls from locals who feel threatened by sectarian attacks. In a sign of how the Good Friday agreement brought peace, but not harmony, to Northern Ireland there are more peace walls now than there were in 2006. They play a particularly important role in north Belfast where the two communities live close to each other."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
