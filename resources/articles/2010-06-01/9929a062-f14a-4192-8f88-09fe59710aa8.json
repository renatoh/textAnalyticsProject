The landscape of the levels feels mysterious and foreign to us dwellers in homely, hilly south Somerset, and the feeling of otherness intensified when winding lanes brought us to the lonely settlement of Ham, on the river Tone. A name on a gate \u2013 Coal Harbour House \u2013 signified something of the place's history as a port on an inland waterway. Over centuries, men sought to widen, straighten and improve the Tone as a commercial navigation. It flows out across the moors to Burrowbridge, where it joins the Parrett and so links with the port of Bridgwater and the sea. There were mills on the island at Ham in the middle ages, and the last barge went from Ham to Burrowbridge in 1929. But the high rise and fall of the tidal reaches of Somerset's rivers has limited their navigability and usefulness. Getting in to Bridgwater harbour was notoriously tricky. The village of Creech St Michael, a little closer into Taunton, demonstrates the progressive attempts to shift goods more efficiently across Somerset. Towards the village centre we went first over two bridges that cross divided arms of the Tone. At the top of the village, another bridge crosses the Taunton and Bridgwater canal, which was opened in 1827 to offer a more direct route and supersede the Tone as a navigable river. But in between we had crossed an ugly metal bridge over the line which the Bristol and Exeter Railway company constructed to make both river and canal redundant. The Tone now pursues its relatively untroubled way across the moors, while the canal is adapted for leisure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
