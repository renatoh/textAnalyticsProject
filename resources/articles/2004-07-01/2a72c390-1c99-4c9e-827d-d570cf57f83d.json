Unlike residents of the White House, who are limited to two terms, winners of the claret jug are allowed to keep coming back for another tilt until they reach pensionable age. For seven former champions the thought of next year was all the comfort they could find as they joined the traditional Friday afternoon of the living dead, the parade of players who know they are doomed to watch the business end of the tournament on the television after missing the cut. Ben Curtis, last year's champion, was among the first of the former winners to acknowledge his fate after a three-over-par 74 left him seven over, three shots outside the cut. Golf does not embrace unlikely winners in the manner of other sports, preferring its champions to be genuinely worthy, and nothing the American has done in the year since he stunned the game by winning at Royal St George's has dispelled the suspicion that he got lucky. As he trudged off the final green, head down and shoulders slumped, there was little more than token applause to mark the end of his reign, and when he returned to the small locker room reserved for former champions there was one final disappointment; it dawned on him that the replica claret jug he bought to fill the space on the mantelpiece occupied by the real one this week would be staying put for at least another 12 months. To his credit, the phlegmatic champion of 2003 acknowledged that he has much to prove if he is not to be remembered only as the exception that proves the rule that Opens produce deserving champions. \"I'm really disappointed. I just wanted to come here and play really well and get myself back into contention,\" he said. \"I know I've got to prove myself in the next couple of years and it's not going to happen overnight. Even if I win next week [at the Irish Open] it's not going to be enough. I've got to do it over a sustained period of time. \"I didn't treat the tournament any differently than last year. I felt better about my game than last year but it's a different golf course, it's a different week and things happen. Unfortunately for me they didn't happen as I would have liked them too.\" While Curtis contemplated an unwanted weekend off with his wife, parents and cousins - all were in Ayrshire to watch his defence - a hugely disappointed Nick Faldo was seeking a drink followed closely by some remedial work on his game. Playing in the same group as Curtis, the three-times champion recorded a six-over-par 77 to finish 11 over and afterwards proved that familiarity with disappointment does nothing to lessen the blow. \"Does it get easier to take? Are you kidding? It's eating me up,\" he said. \" I wasn't comfortable out there. I was driving badly, putting badly, hit a couple of lousy wedge shots . . . my swing was not good. \"There's a lot of changes needed before the next time I tee it up [also in Ireland]. I've got to do something different next time because it's too frustrating doing it the other way. I need, well, I need a drink.\" Paul Lawrie, the champion of 1999 whose victory also lacks credibility, coming as it did after a play-off at a fiendishly difficult Carnoustie set-up, was also on his way after a 77. He started the day seven over and an outward nine of 40 sealed his fate, and as he dragged himself home he looked as if he would have rather been anywhere other than Ayrshire. Greg Norman, champion in 1986 and 1993, at least had the means to get out rapidly after signing for a 76 to finish seven over, the first time he has missed the cut in an Open since 1980. The Australian has the largest private jet at Prestwick airport, a Gulfstream V, and if his mood on the 18th green was anything to go by its engines would have been running as he left the recorders' tent: \"From my perspective my putting was pathetic and so was everything else. I just couldn't get anything going, end of story.\" John Daly (78 for six over), Tom Lehman (78 for nine over) and Tom Weiskopf (80 for plus 18) completed the roll of former champions who will not see the 1st tee today, and they were joined by the man who should have been defending the title this week. Thomas Bjorn lost the chance of winning last year's Open in a bunker at the 16th, and yesterday he blew his chances of making the weekend when he started double bogey, triple bogey. He finished on 79 for a 153. The look on his face suggested he might need persuading to come back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
