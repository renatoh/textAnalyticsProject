The Welshman joined Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry in lifting the UK, Masters and world titles in the same season as he eventually triumphed 18-16 over Doherty, who had trailed 10-2 at one stage. Doherty enhanced his reputation as the game's comeback kid here in the afternoon as he rapidly reduced a six-frame overnight deficit to revive this final as a meaningful contest. The Irishman clearly responds best when the chips are down and he needed to on Sunday after allowing Williams to build up that 10-2 lead. At that point it seemed as though the Welshman would cruise to his second world title. But Doherty won three of the remaining four frames on Sunday and seven out of eight yesterday afternoon to threaten the finest final day recovery in the history of the Championship. Although Dennis Taylor was 7-0 down to Steve Davis after the opening session of their 1985 final, he trailed only by three overnight before winning 18-17 on the final black. Jimmy White pushed Davis to 18-16 on the second day of their 1984 final after being 12-4 behind but for a reversal of this magnitude only the 1992 final in which Stephen Hendry trailed 14-8 only to surge the title 18-14 on a 10-frame winning streak could be compared to Doherty's sequence of 10 out of 12 to level this match with a session to go. The 13th frame had been a turning point. Williams led 69-0 but lost position through a lapse of concentration leaving Doherty requiring a snooker. He made a break of 32 and then managed to extract the necessary penalty points before eventually taking the frame on the black. At first, this seemed to make no difference. Williams comprehensively shut his opponent out of the next frame and even though Doherty claimed the last frame of the day on the pink with a 50 clearance, he appeared out of contention. The overnight break had clearly benefited Doherty more than Williams and when the Welsh left-hander missed a black from its spot, from his first chance yesterday, it was not an encouraging portent. Doherty, who in every session except one in this Championship has been very sharply away, clinched the opening frame with a 52 break, the second from 28-0 down and closed to only three behind with a break of 128. Williams then sank two outstanding pots at the start of the next but undermined their value by sending a straight pink wide from point-blank range. The mistakes continued as the afternoon wore on. Doherty has never been as sharp as he is here and the tactical game which was his bedrock saw him inch his way to 11-11, the last two frames of this sequence occupying an hour between them. Williams, who has never had to withstand a recovery like this, was being engulfed by a tide no less deadly for being gradual but he managed to win the penultimate frame of the afternoon before Doherty's total clearance of 115 took him into the final session level with a possible 11 frames to play. Doherty has had to draw upon his huge reserves of mental stamina on an arduous path to the final with wins of 10-9 on the final black over Shaun Murphy, 13-12 against Graeme Dott, 13-8 over John Higgins and his extraordinary 17-16 triumph over Hunter. No player has ever had to play so many frames to get so near to winning the title in the modern era. As for Williams, he had a mere couple of hours to absorb the impact of an apparently certain second world title turning into the most traumatic defeat of his career. His coach Terry Griffiths once said of his own career: \"The worst time is when you've almost won or when you've got the chance to get so far in front, that barring a miracle, you can't be caught. It's so difficult to stop your mind running on ahead.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
