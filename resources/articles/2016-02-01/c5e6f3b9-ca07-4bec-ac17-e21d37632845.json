Looking towards a crucial week in Zurich, when the Asian Football Confederation president, Bahrain\u2019s Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, will go head to head with Uefa\u2019s general secretary, Gianni Infantino, to replace the disgraced Sepp Blatter, Glenn said: \u201cI feel very confident about the future of football. Football is massively popular, it\u2019s growing, it is really in a healthy state. In a way I\u2019d hold on to that and say, yes, if there\u2019s another major scandal permeating Fifa, it may not withstand it. \u201cBut there are a lot of good things that Fifa does, so even if it was wound up and called something else, it would still be doing a lot of good things it\u2019s doing today. I hope we get Gianni winning it and I hope we get the reforms through.\u201d A host of changes will be considered by Fifa\u2019s 207 voting members before they decide on the next president. Fifa was pitched into chaos in May when Swiss police arrested a number of senior Fifa executives at the behest of the US Department of Justice and Blatter was forced to stand down. Along with Michel Platini, who was favourite to replace him, Blatter was, in December, banned for eight years over a \u00a31.35m payment to the French Uefa president. The FA was embarrassed by its early backing for Platini and waited until last week to pledge its formal support for Infantino. \u201cWe\u2019ve backed the right guy, so from what we can tell based on track record, he knows football the best,\u201d said Glenn, who joined the FA in May. \u201cBut there\u2019s probably still a lot of things to play out in Fifa. There are other players in this. The US Department of Justice and whatever else.\u201d Fifa insiders suspect that there could be further arrests in Zurich next week. Glenn chose Infantino from a list of five candidates that includes the former Fifa executive J\u00e9r\u00f4me Champagne, the Jordanian former Fifa executive committee member Prince Ali bin al-Hussein and the South African Tokyo Sexwale. \u201cDoes it need a new broom? Well, it\u2019s not getting one,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cOut of all the people that we\u2019ve got, Gianni stands the best chance of modernising it and giving it the transparency that we think it all deserves.\u201d Glenn said that even if Fifa imploded, another organisation would emerge to run the World Cup. \u201cPeople love the World Cup, so we want the World Cup to be run well. And how would it be run well?\u201d he said. \u201cYou can speculate, if there was another car crash at Fifa, football would survive, and it will survive by people organising it differently.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
