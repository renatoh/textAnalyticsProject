He was floored by the experience. He was even more floored when the 5 (pictured) insisted he see their \"baby brother\" band, a strange improvisatory troupe called the Psychedelic Stooges. \"We weren't interested in anything like writing a song or making a chord change,\" Iggy Pop later told the writer Clinton Heylin. A fortnight later, Fields dragged out his boss, Jac Holzman, to see the two bands, who were both signed to the label. They made Elektra no money, but between them they set the twin and oppositional poles of punk culture for decades to come: the 5 were the politically committed, musically experimental revolutionaries; the Stooges were the three-chord nihilists, living out their basest instincts. Both templates continue to thrive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
