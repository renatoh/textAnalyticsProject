Fair to say it\u2019s been a few weeks of squiffy, high-concept episodes. Now, we get something more traditional \u2013 a good old-fashioned \u2018celebrity historical\u2019. The Doctor wants to take Team Tardis somewhere fun, opting for the night Lord Byron challenged a nascent Mary Shelley to write what would become Frankenstein. Everything unfolds pleasingly; there\u2019s even dancing. Writer Maxine Alderton clearly knows her stuff, from Mary and Percy\u2019s unconventional matrimonial arrangements to 1816 being \u2018the year without a summer\u2019. A classic ghost story unfolds in a classic haunted house, and we get the sort of history lesson that should always form part of Doctor Who\u2019s MO. And then ... things get squiffy again. Captain Jack\u2019s warning \u201cbeware the Lone Cyberman\u201d comes frighteningly true, as a half-finished version of the classic enemy is revealed to be the clear and present danger, responsible for both the possession of Percy and the Doctor\u2019s reckless actions in step one of her big plan. By beaming it far into the future, she is only setting up the cataclysmic events of the imminent finale, which are sure to bite her in the knee-length jacket. Fixing this mess is not going to be easy. We now build to a finale which, in all hope, will smash everything that\u2019s come before it out of the park. We are also promised a look at the epic Cyberwar \u2013 an episode of unseen continuity teased for decades. Well, it has to be better than the last finale, right? Life aboard the Tardis The japes of Team Tardis are under threat again, and the Doctor has a warning for Graham, Yaz and Ryan. \u201cSometimes this team structure isn\u2019t flat,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s mountainous, with me at the summit, left to choose.\u201d Still, there are certain things we can rely on: Graham favours food over pretty much everything else, and Yaz is realising she\u2019s the only one apart from the Doctor with any sense. Fear factor Ever since Doctor Who returned in 2005, I have said that the second biggest enemies in the lore have been underserved. I\u2019d go so far as to say that the first iconic Cyber story was Peter Capaldi\u2019s chilling finale World Enough and Time \u2013 which brought back the 1960s Mondasian Cybermen. We can only hope for a continuation of that as the finale approaches. But things look promising with the body horror of this week\u2019s Lone Cyberman. The very sight of a half-exposed human face and a half-human voice provided exactly the required chills. The Doctor also gave one of the most potent descriptions of the Cybermen to the assembled intelligentsia of the villa: \u201cOrgans, flesh, surgically removed without consent. It drives them insane, so they turn off the brain too, [remove] all emotion.\u201d Mysteries and questions With the two-part closer looming, there are still huge question marks over what became of Hot Camp Master and Doctor Ruth, but it seems impossible they won\u2019t feature. We do at least know more about the Lone Cyberman, and Chris Chibnall\u2019s most recent comments confirm that the Cyber threat will only escalate. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the most epic space opera stories we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s a big, big Cyberman story, that last two-parter. There are a lot of Cybermen coming in this series. It might start with one Cyberman, but you\u2019ll see a lot. It\u2019s as epic and emotional as the opening two-parter.\u201d Deeper into the vortex \u2022 \u201cSave the poet, save the universe.\u201d Has somebody been watching a Heroes boxset? \u2022 The Doctor is distressed enough to take this personally \u2013 she won\u2019t lose anyone else to Cybernisation. Remember, it\u2019s not so long since s/he lost Bill Potts to a similar fate. \u2022 Some intriguing controversy followed last week\u2019s episode, Can You Hear Me? The BBC was forced to issue a statement following complaints about Graham\u2019s anxiety over his cancer returning, and the Doctor blaming \u2018social anxiety\u2019 for her inability to comfort him. The BBC said: \u201cWe never set out to upset our viewers with what we show and this episode tackled some sensitive themes \u2026 When Graham opened up to the Doctor about his fear of his cancer returning, her response was never meant to be dismissive. The Doctor\u2019s friend was scared, and we see her struggling to deal with the severity of the situation.\u201d \u2022 In the latest in an occasional series of related pop songs, T\u2019Pau\u2019s power ballad China In Your Hand was inspired by the events of Villa Diodati. Next time Though it feels like we\u2019ve barely got going, the two-part finale kicks off next week with the thrillingly titled Ascension of the Cybermen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
