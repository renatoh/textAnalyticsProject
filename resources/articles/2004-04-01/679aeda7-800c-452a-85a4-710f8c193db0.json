So that the radiant photograph tells the viewer: this is what your daffodils would look like at dawn, if you yourself were a daffodil. The sun picks out the stems, and everything is to a greater or lesser extent translucent, down there among the new growth. There is nothing twiggy or wooden. And it obsesses us, those of us who embarked, years ago, upon this artifice of a garden without artifice: this seeking out of new shoots, this identification of species where there are as yet no obvious identifying marks. Here are the seedlings. Which is the parent plant? What is it, among all the competing candidates, that has succeeded with this abundance of fine emerald shoots? Or what is that single plant, surely a young bulb? Was it planted? Did it seed itself? Or is it something that has dwindled over the years, something that should never have been introduced in the first place - it stood no chance. The books, the catalogues tell us of some flower: this naturalises well. And they often forget to explain what they mean by naturalisation. Do they simply mean that this variety will sit well, and look well, in its matrix of turf? Is it supposed to \"clump up\"? Or do they mean, what we want them to mean, that it will cast around an abundance of seed, and that in next to no time we shall be wading through meadows full of it? \"Next to no time\" - that was the illusion. Of all the forms of gardening, this pursuit of the flowery mead is the most prone to disappoint, and I've come across several people - not flibbertigibbets either - who have been through that phase, that project, and moved on to something else. A professional gardener or designer will perhaps take a balanced view of his client and say there is enthusiasm here but no realism to balance it, no sense of the time involved; they would understand, if they were planting an arboretum, that it takes decades, but they expect a meadow to perform at their command. The sacred plants, in the sect to which I belong, are the fritillary and the orchid. But the orchids come and go, for us, unpredictably. Rabbits and deer have a lot to do with it. In a short while, a roundabout on the Oxford ring-road, at the foot of Boar's Hill, will be stiff with orchids - it is a rabbit-free, deer-free zone. Yet one of the experts who came to view the fields here told me of a friend of hers on Boar's Hill who decided to leave her lawn unmown and see what happened. What happened immediately was that she had a lawn full of orchids. For how many years I thought: well, I am lucky with many things but not so lucky with fritillaries - they tolerate this place but will not make it their home. But all those years I lacked the skill (I don't say I have it now) to look closely at a piece of turf, and detect the seedlings of one, two, three or four years old. Then came the year of the fritillary epiphany, when we realised not only that we had many more fritillaries but that there were immature shoots all around them, which in years to come would make their own dense turf. A meadow, properly so called, is a creation of agriculture, since its ecology depends on when the grass is cut and when the animals are put out on it. The whole thing is a product of system and routine. But this garden version of a meadow (which sits alongside a real meadow) is a botanical fiction. Every year plants are introduced to it by hand, and given the chance to make the most of the system, or to dwindle. On the principle that, when you find a garden long overgrown, the cottage-garden peony will be one of the survivors in the long grass, such peonies have been introduced and asked to behave naturally, to behave as if neglected, although they are watched incessantly. No cattle tread this turf down, so they do not press the innumerable seeds into the soil. The cracks that form in summer are never stamped over by hooves, and the rain itself is not enough to fill back the rift valleys that appear over the years. Yet I find that certain camassias, the ones that only seem to increase by the bulbs clumping up, have a way of increasing along these old canyons, as if the bulbs in the heavy clay can take the line of least resistance. Some things take immediately to the regime - the cowslips (another lover of the roundabout and the motorway verge) have long since proved their point. Others, like the orchids, will suddenly explain themselves: you can have orchids, they say, but in the cracks between the paving-stones, not on your turf."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
