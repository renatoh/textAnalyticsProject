The fifth and final episode is no different. It opens with a slow, ambient montage of sunny Pripyat. Couples stroll in the gardens or swim in the communal pool. Children cavort in the playground. Lyudmilla Ignatenko smiles as her husband, Vasily, plays with their neighbour\u2019s children. We have been taken back in time, 12 hours before the disaster at reactor No 4. As Pripyat blissfully goes about its day, a safety test is planned at Chernobyl HQ. Promotions are promised if everything goes to plan. There is some concern over productivity quotas; Kiev has called to warn there might not be enough power to run the reactor safely. A delay is mooted, but Moscow is expectant. The test will go ahead. Hours later, Vasily will be one of the first responders at the explosion. In Vienna, months after the explosion, Jared Harris\u2019s Valery Legasov \u2013 who keeps finding tufts of his hair falling from his scalp \u2013 meets with the KGB\u2019s Chairman Charkov. Valery has dutifully engaged in \u201cstatecraft\u201d and lied to the gathered scientists. \u201cI think you made an excellent impression at the conference,\u201d Charkov says. Valery, we learn, has entered into a faustian pact. He has told the world what the KGB wanted him to say in return for \u201cassurances\u201d that the remaining reactors will be quietly dealt with. Nothing has been done. But Charkov makes his priorities clear; first, a show trial of Chernobyl\u2019s directors, where Valery must lie again. \u201cWe will have our heroes, we will have our villains, we will have our truth,\u201d Charkov says. \u201cAfter that, we can deal with our reactors.\u201d Chernobyl was the disaster of a state built on the cult of obedience. The final episode, and indeed the series as a whole, has hinged on a single question: can Valery bring himself to tell the truth, even if doing so would be futile and suicidal? When the toxic dust settles on this show, director Johan Renck and screenwriter Craig Mazin will be remembered for crafting a remarkably cogent and multivalent drama, one aided by impeccable performances; Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Emily Watson have each never been better. The verisimilitude of the show is exemplary. Many of the characters, such as Lyudmilla and Vasily Ignatenko, are based on testimony given to Svetlana Alexievich for her Nobel prize-winning 1997 book Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster. But Chernobyl has also defined itself by its ability to use genre tropes from other dystopias \u2013 which, in turn, were influenced by the event itself. The series has exhibited usages of body horror that David Cronenberg would be proud of. Or there are the slow, foreboding scenes of wind shivering through the trees that feel familiar to George A Romero and the countless zombie horror films he spawned. In this episode, Chernobyl shows itself a dab hand as a courtroom drama, as we switch between the hermetic environs of the trial and the stress of the control room in the hours leading up to the explosion. In doing so, the show allows a wider philosophical question to play out - should the true always be told, regardless of its cost? Is the truth worth it? As London rolls out the red carpet for Donald Trump, it is worth noting Chernobyl\u2019s active focus on the power of the \u201cofficial truth\u201d. The largest release of nuclear fall-out in the history of humanity was made possible by the lies perpetuated at the highest levels of government, abetted by a media that wilfully engaged in propaganda and the dissemination of false information. It happened because scientific research was dismissed or suppressed when it didn\u2019t fit with the agenda of the authorities. The series rams this point home, and is all the better for it. Is this relevant today? Well, 54 nuclear power plants are currently under construction in 16 countries, with 454 active plants across the world. This is in a time of resurgent nationalist authoritarianism the world over, not to mention the unpredictable weather events and seismic shifts that, thanks to our rapid warming of the climate, are increasing in regularity and scale. Lest we forget, in the course of this decade, Fukushima \u2013 a plant in one of most advanced and internationally compliant states in the world \u2013 went into meltdown because of a consequence of a freak geological event. Yet the series is also hopeful. It pays homage to the 600,000 people, many of whom, without ever being named or recognised, can legitimately be credited for saving the lives of millions of people. As Tarkovsky did in Stalker, the iconic Russian film that seemed to foretell the disaster, Renck and Mazin have heightened their characters\u2019 stories through the sudden, forensic focus on seemingly happenstance details. In one moment in this final episode, Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s Boris Shcherbina pauses to watch a tiny green caterpillar climb up his thumb. It is like a prophecy in itself \u2013 amid unimaginable horror, tragedy and decay, nature always has the power to rejuvenate. \u201cAhhh,\u201d he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I quite agree. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 June 2019 because an earlier version referred to the tsunami as a weather event. It was due to a consequence of a geological event. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
