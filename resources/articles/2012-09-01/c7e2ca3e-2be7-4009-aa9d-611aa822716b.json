Fifteen tries from their first three games and 15 points out of 15 are trends unlikely to continue with a trip to Welford Road in the offing this weekend. The fact that the frolics are about to end, though, is something they, like any self-respecting champions, are relishing at The Stoop. \"We can't wait for the next few weeks,\" said Conor O'Shea, their director of rugby. \"It's lovely to have the start we have had but now we've got Leicester away, Saracens at home, Exeter away, Biarritz at home, Connacht away. It's just a treadmill.\" What equips them all the better for such assignments these days, apart from the belief that comes with being champions, is a set piece to reckon with. \"That's been a very big factor in this team in the past six, seven months,\" said O'Shea. \"People always say, when it gets wet and dirty, can we scrummage? Yes. Can we maul? Yes. We're very comfortable we have other strings to our bow.\" The last time they went to Connacht, in January, they lost in a storm, which cost them a place in the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup. On Saturday, apart from running rings round Sale at times, they comprehensively dominated a front five containing Effion Lewis-Roberts, the mountainous loosehead fresh from the rigours of the French league, and Richie Gray, some people's tip as a Lions lock. They look well placed to fare better under such circumstances in future. Much credit is being heaped upon the two Joes in their front row, Marler and Gray. The lesser known of the two is Gray, the hooker who hides his barnet under a scrum cap, unlike Marler. He did not miss a lineout and was at the heart of that scrum effort. O'Shea thinks an England call-up is imminent. \"I don't think there's a better line-out thrower in the game and he has a work ethic like Chris Robshaw's.\" Less needs to be said of the other Joe, but still time was taken to pay tribute to him. \"He's the ripe old age of 22. He's going to get bigger and stronger, and that's a scary thought for anyone. He'll be an exceptional player. England are very lucky to have him. His grandmother's from Crossmaglen, isn't she?\" Sale couldn't cope with the mix, despite manning the floodgates credibly, until they gave way for two tries in the last six minutes. Harlequins scored their first try from their first attack in the second minute, which, as O'Shea conceded, is often more of a curse, as players get it into their heads that the ensuing match is going to be easy. Harlequins are making things look easy at the moment but it will not always be like this. Other champion teams are lining up to take a shot. \"There'll be times when we're written up as great,\" said O'Shea of the next few months, \"and times when we're written off as poor. But we just want to be somewhere at the end of the season where we can do something.\" If the start is anything to go by, they should be that.
