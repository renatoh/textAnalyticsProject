Denied a chance to interview the chancellor of the exchequer, they could only photograph or film him as he opened Belfast's new science park, shook hands with a fresh batch of police recruits or paid a visit to army HQ. \"It's like a bloody royal visit,\" fumed one television reporter. And so, in a way, it was. Lots of chit-chat - \"And where do you come from?\" - and plenty of rictus smiles for the cameras as Gordon Brown took his ongoing UK tour to Northern Ireland on Monday. All that was missing were the flag-waving children and a few bouquets. Officially it was simply a visit by a government minister. Several of those who met Brown tried to play along with that fiction, framing their remarks in terms of costs and budgets. But they all knew what it was really about: they were there, Northern Ireland's chief constable as much as the leaders of the main political parties, to meet the next prime minister. Such a dynamic is entirely new in British politics. The US might have its three-month transitions between presidents, but Britain has had no equivalent. Until now. For Brown has emerged as that most novel entity: a prime minister designate. Following him for the day gave a glimpse of how, should he inherit - and I am one of those who believe that nothing in politics is certain - he will be seen. How a Prime Minister Brown, no longer chained either to the dispatch box on budget day or the inner corridors of the Treasury, might look. And we should brace ourselves: it will be very different. He has little of the slickness that marks out his presumed predecessor, Tony Blair, and imminent rival, David Cameron. When he spoke at the science park he made no spontaneous reference to his hosts or warm-up joke - as Blair and Cameron do everywhere and always - but went straight into his prepared text. He told one gag, but it fell flat. When he unveiled a plaque he stood in the wrong place as he pulled back the curtain, ruining the shot for television. Blair wears TV make-up for public appearances, to give him colour. Brown was pale, his jacket rumpled, and he had a visible shaving cut on his left cheek. None of this seems to bother the chancellor unduly. He does not share the pessimism of the Brownite MP Michael Wills, who made what the camp insist was an unauthorised prediction at the weekend that Labour will be out of office for 15 years. Brown believes the doomsayers are underestimating the British public; that, in the end, voters will react to substance, not style, deciding what's best for themselves and the country, not which candidate is more likable. People liked Jim Callaghan in 1979 and actively disliked Margaret Thatcher - but they voted for her because they thought she was right. Brown will have another advantage too: a stint in power before taking on Cameron, a chance to remake the political weather. The chancellor is a keen student of US politics, where the notion of the magical 100 days was born. So what will he do in his first 100 days in power? His opening move will, of course, be the appointment of a team. Watch for promotions for those who aim for quiet competence rather than headline-grabbing prominence: the top rank of the Brown administration will be more Alistair Darling than John Reid. Aware that the public has lost confidence in Labour's basic ability to manage things properly, Brown will favour ministers who keep out of the papers and get on with running departments well, restoring essential confidence. He will also seize on new blood, to signal that this is a new government. Stand by for promotions for the Miliband brothers, his confidant Ed Balls and the rising stars James Purnell and Andy Burnham. It's a fair bet that he will make at least one radical move very early. The precedent here is the independence of the Bank of England, granted by the new chancellor 24 hours after the 1997 election. That was planned for years in advance, but still had the power of surprise; Brown clearly wants to repeat the trick if he moves next door. What does he have in mind? No one will let on. It's a racing certainty, too, that Brown will move fast to secure both his flanks, left and right. To reassure the Sun and others bent on casting him as Red Gordon, the new PM is bound to announce some unambiguously New Labour initiative. So far this government has privatised anything not bolted down: my hunch is that Prime Minister Brown will get out his spanner, unbolt the rest and sell much of it off. The bosses of Channel 4, for example, should prepare for the worst. Brown will not abandon the Guardian-reading tribe; he's always had more respect for that part of the core Labour vote than the current incumbent. They can look forward to House of Lords reform that will make it \"fully accountable\" while still respecting the supremacy of the Commons. Translation: a fully elected Lords, its role explicitly confined to that of a revising chamber. There will also be more constitutional change, again modelled on Bank of England independence. Brown will transfer the power to make war from the executive to parliament, and shed Downing Street's patronage over honours and the appointment of bishops. In 1997 he denied himself the right to set interest rates; now he wants to tie his hands once more, again to boost public trust. It's not impossible that he'll propose all this be set down in a new, written constitution. Sometimes there will be simultaneous straddling of left and right. I expect a Brown government to crack down just as hard on terror suspects, perhaps extending again the period of detention without charge from the current 28 days, but sweetening the pill with safeguards that civil liberties campaigners would struggle to reject: regular judicial oversight, a formal report-back to parliament to check on potential police abuses. On antisocial behaviour there could be a similar blend, with no rowing back from Blair's Asbo agenda, but a new emphasis on helping delinquent kids as much as on punishing them. It could be night football games or pirate-style radio stations - schemes that give disadvantaged teenagers something to do. Or, to revive a slogan coined by Brown: tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime. Perhaps the trickiest question the coming man will face is the one that destroyed trust in the incumbent: Iraq. The most straightforward option would be to ape Romano Prodi in Italy: declare the war a \"grave mistake\" and announce imminent troop withdrawals. But that option is not open to Brown. He voted for the Iraq war and did not resign over it: he cannot possibly claim now to be against it. Yet he has to do something to win back those whose faith in Labour was broken by the invasion. The likely solution is some kind of admission that terrible mistakes were made in the conduct of the war and afterwards, and a strong signal that nothing like it will ever happen again. Will it work? Gordon Brown does not look like a man preparing for failure. He may not have the glad-handing skills of a PR professional, but as a big-picture strategist he has few rivals. So long as he gets to ask the question - who best prepares Britain to face the threat and opportunity of globalisation? - he's sure voters will see him as the answer. He believes his moment is finally coming, and he is nothing if not prepared. freedland@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
