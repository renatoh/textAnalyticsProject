The 36-year-old Italian forward has asked Charlton to cancel the contract he signed just two months ago in order to return to Lazio, the team he has supported since he was a child and where he once played as a teenager. \"There has been much speculation about his possible return to Lazio in the past but the truth is that only yesterday he received a concrete offer from his former club,\" said Di Canio's agent Moreno Roggi. \"Today he went to speak with the directors of Charlton because for him playing again with the Lazio shirt would be a dream coming true.\" According to reports from Italy, Di Canio has already agreed a contract with Claudio Lotito, the Rome club's new president, and is prepared to take a 60% salary cut. \"The English club want time to think about it because losing a player like Di Canio just a few days before the start of the season is not easy,\" said Roggi. \"At this stage it's up to them. Di Canio is really happy at Charlton and I'm sure that he would not have considered any other offer. With Lazio, however, is a completely dif ferent story. He loves his former club.\" Di Canio arrived in Britain in May 1996, joining Celtic from Milan for \u00a31m. In Italy he had also played for Juventus and Napoli. In 1997 he switched to the Premiership when he was signed by Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a33m. Di Canio's career was rescued by West Ham after he served a ban for pushing over the referee Paul Alcock and the forward repaid the Hammers' trust by becoming a cult hero at Upton Park, before moving to Charlton last summer. Leicester's manager Micky Adams has signed the 33-year-old midfielder Scot Gemmill on a three-month deal. Released by Everton at the end of last season, Gemmill impressed while on trial with the Foxes during pre-season. Gemmill said: \"I was given the chance to go on tour to Scotland because the manager felt the team was a bit short in midfield. It was up to me to show I was up to the job and even though I was not 100% fit then, I will be soon. \"Initially the deal was only going to be one month, which was not really long enough to make an impression, but now I have got three months. I would still have preferred longer but I am not really in a position to argue.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
