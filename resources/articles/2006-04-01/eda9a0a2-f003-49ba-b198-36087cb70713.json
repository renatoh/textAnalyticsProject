Policy with regard to Aer Lingus, cuts in Belfast youth-service provision, unacceptable unionist flag-flying in Lisburn, secret CIA rendition flights, Derry city's long-overdue name change, rural planning, the EU services directive: eight topics of burning importance for the province and eight urgent press releases (most before lunchtime too). Oddly, nary a word about a former senior Sinn F\u00e9in official who spied for Britain for 20 years and has just been found shot in the back of the head, plunging the stalled peace process into etc. But then they did have such a lot else on their plate. Unlike New Labour's media monitoring unit, of course, which, despite having to deal with all those horrid articles about what is apparently known in Victoria Street as the \"TeeBee-GeeBees\", still somehow finds time to enjoy its brief moment in the sun. This morning's thrill-a-minute media briefing, we learn from the inevitable reliable source, went to the trouble of roundly rejecting our item roundly rejecting its earlier round rejection of our initial claim that it fell for this paper's splendid \"Coldplay backs Cameron\" April fool. We may soon, we fear, be forced to conclude that they have nothing better to do. But at least they don't have to deal with the off-the-cuff utterances of the president of the United States, who, addressing a meeting at - where else? - Freedom House in Washington last week, remarked, apropos of the urgent imperative to keep blasting those goddam Iraqis to blazes: \"One of the great things about America, one of the beauties of our country, is that when we see a young, innocent child blown up by an IED [improvised explosive device], we cry.\" Smile; it's what makes America great. But back to our very own foot-in-mouth expert, the member for Bethnal Green and Bow, who following his recent run-in with News of the World undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, has generously written to his fellow MPs warning them of the threat the fake sheikh poses to our democracy. Oddly, however, Gorgeous George is not getting quite the warm and sympathetic response his selfless and public-spirited gesture deserves. \"You may have read of my encounter with this man,\" the Respect MP writes in an email of which we have, unaccountably, obtained a copy. \"I am enclosing a copy of two photographs ... in order that you may be on your guard.\" His colleagues were quick to express their gratitude. \"This just goes to show it takes one impostor to spot another,\" hisses Ian Austin (Lab, Dudley North). \"After all, you managed to persuade the people of Bethnal Green and Bow you would be a hard-working local MP.\" Gisela Stuart (Lab, Birmingham Edgbaston) is even sweeter. \"George,\" she inquires, \"how about working for the people who elected you, rather than ... your overinflated ego?\" And so, logically, to Barbi with Style, the website of Britain's 10th National BBQ 2006, containing (and we quote) \"everything you need to know about barbecue recipes, food, trends, grilling, hardware, tips, music, fashion and much, much more, to make sure you chill 'n' grill all summer!\" Alarmingly, the top Breaking BBQ News headline of the day is the chillin' 'n' grillin' \"Killing Will Not Derail N Ireland Peace Process\". These guys are hot. Talk to Sinn F\u00e9in. Or to the BBC, where the demise of the unit that prepared the hourly scripted news summary for local radio stations has not been without consequence. Recent bulletins have featured culture secretary Tessa Dowell, President Mustafa of Pakistan, and Italian prime minister Silvia Binoculars. Blame the computer spellchecker, we're inevitably told. And finally, the Oban Times reports that a man was \"charged with possession of controlled substances in Glenshellach Terrace following a joint operation between uniformed and CID officers\".
