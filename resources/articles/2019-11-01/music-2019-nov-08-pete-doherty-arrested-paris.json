The Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said the 40-year-old Libertines and Babyshambles frontman was placed in detention on Thursday night after being stopped by police during a drugs transaction. The office would not comment on French media reports that Doherty was carrying two grams of cocaine and was arrested in Pigalle, an area known for its late-night bars. The Guardian has contacted representatives of Doherty for comment. Since rising to fame in the 2000s, Doherty, the former boyfriend of model Kate Moss, has been repeatedly arrested for drug offences. The reunited Libertines are preparing for a tour of Europe that starts on 18 November in Brussels. The band has not yet issued information as to whether Doherty\u2019s arrest will affect the forthcoming concerts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
