Speaking during an end-of-year press conference just one day after Republicans promised fresh legislation designed to force the project\u2019s approval, the president departed from official White House neutrality on an upcoming review by the State Department to deliver a withering assessment of its merits, claiming his opponents were wrong to insist the pipeline was a \u201cmagic formula\u201d for economic growth. \u201cAt issue in Keystone is not American oil; it is Canadian oil that is drawn out of tar sands in Canada,\u201d he said when asked if he was minimising the benefits. \u201cThat oil currently is being shipped out through rail or trucks, and it would save Canadian oil companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pipe it all the way through the United States down to the Gulf.\u201d Seemingly aware of the impact his unusually blunt language may have on the politically-charged debate over whether environmental or economic arguments should prevail, Obama checked himself briefly but left reporters in little doubt of his strong feelings on the issue. \u201cSo there\u2019s no \u2013 I won\u2019t say no \u2013 there is very little impact, nominal impact, on US gas prices, what the average American consumer cares about, by having this pipeline come through,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the way this gets sold is, you know, \u2018Let\u2019s get this oil, and it\u2019s going to come here,\u2019 and the implication is that that\u2019s going to lower gas prices here in the United States. It\u2019s not.\u201d Despite pressure from US producers who claim the Keystone XL extension would benefit them too, Obama added: \u201cThere\u2019s a global oil market. It\u2019s very good for Canadian oil companies, and it\u2019s good for the Canadian oil industry, but it\u2019s not going to be a huge benefit to US consumers. It\u2019s not even going to be a nominal benefit to US consumers.\u201d Republicans, who argue the pipeline would create large numbers of jobs, announced this week that they plan to pass legislation authorising the extension when they take control of the Senate next month. Obama refused to say whether he would definitely block such a bill \u2013 a presidential veto which would need two-thirds of Congress to override \u2013 but insisted the employment benefits had been \u201chyped\u201d out of proportion. \u201cThe construction of the pipeline itself will create probably a couple thousand jobs. Those are temporary jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s probably some additional jobs that can be created in the refining process down in the Gulf. Those aren\u2019t, you know, completely insignificant. But when you consider what we could be doing if we were rebuilding our roads and bridges around the country, something that Congress could authorise, we could probably create hundreds of thousands of jobs or a million jobs.\u201d The pipeline\u2019s backers are currently waiting for a court verdict from Nebraska on whether their route is permissible, and it is unclear whether a Senate vote on the matter would come before or after a planned State Department environmental review. Nevertheless, the White House has shown growing willingness to defy energy interests in the weeks since November\u2019s midterm elections, and Obama echoed some of the environmental arguments he used when agreeing to major new climate change targets with China. \u201cI want to make sure that if in fact this project goes forward, that it\u2019s not adding to the problem of climate change, which I think is very serious and does impose serious costs on the American people, some of them long term,\u201d he told the press conference. \u201cIf we got more flooding, more wildfires, more droughts, there are direct economic impacts in that and as we\u2019re now rebuilding after Sandy, for example, we\u2019re having to consider how do we increase preparedness \u2013 that\u2019s an example of the kind of costs that are imposed and you can put a dollar figure on it.\u201d Yet despite Obama\u2019s growing scepticism over what has been a symbolic decision for environmentalists and industrialists alike, the president also used his opening remarks to praise America\u2019s newfound energy self-sufficiency. \u201cAmerica is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas,\u201d he said in opening remarks designed to emphasise a recent recovery in the job market. \u201cWe\u2019re saving drivers about 70 cents a gallon at the pump over last Christmas.\u201d Otherwise, the shorter-than-usual press conference focused mainly on North Korea\u2019s alleged role in attacking Sony and a reaffirming of recent comments on Cuba and US race relations.
