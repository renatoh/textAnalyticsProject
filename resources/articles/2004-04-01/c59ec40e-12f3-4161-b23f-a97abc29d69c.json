Britons all sit down at 4pm to take afternoon tea, along with cucumber sandwiches and perhaps scones and jam. 2. When we're not lazing around drinking tea, we're probably enjoying other traditional items such as cockles or Welsh laverbread. 3. While we consume our cockles we will most likely be clad in tweed or possibly waxed cotton, whatever that is. 4. After tea we like to watch men dancing around with bells on their legs waving hankies, an ancient British tradition visitors to these shores are unlikely to see on London's Oxford Street. 5. To see this ritual visitors would have to travel to the countryside, probably by railway, which according to the guidebook are \"efficient and reliable\". Visitors should perhaps see David Hare's play The Permanent Way first before buying a train ticket. 6. Which, when they do, will undoubtedly involve another great British tradition, queueing. 7. While queueing patiently, visitors can partake in the great British obsession, discussing the weather, although according to the guidebook we hardly ever experience \"long periods of adverse weather or extreme temperatures\". 8. The British, the guidebook says, are devoted to hoarding seemingly useless objects. Now that's no way to speak about the royal family. 9. Beneath our tweed and waxed cotton, however, all may not be what it seems - Britain is an international centre of cross dressing. And while we may still have Pearly kings and queens, bowler hats are no longer required dress. 10. So there you have it. An accurate picture of Britain in the 21st century. If you've spent your life in a cave, that is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
