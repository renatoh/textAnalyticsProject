Picking out themes to describe the anonymous characters of Nimrod or Dorabella, he dedicated it to \"my friends pictured within\". On Monday the leading British composer Jonathan Dove, acclaimed for operas such as Flight and Tobias and the Angel, will offer BBC Radio 3 listeners the chance to commission a similar short orchestral portrait \u2013 this time of a public figure \u2013 to be composed by him by the end of the year. As the station's \"composer in residence\" for the day, Dove is to ask his audience for suggestions to inspire him and will announce his decision on Tuesday. \"I am being given the chance to write a 10-minute piece that could be one extended movement or several shorter movements looking at different angles or aspects of the subject,\" said Dove. \"I would like to be surprised by the suggestions and it would be nice to pick someone unsung. In fact, Unsung Hero might not be a bad title.\" Other highlights of Radio 3's Portraits Day will include Elgar's Variations, Eric Coates's The Three Elizabeths Suite and Jerome Kern's Portrait for Orchestra: Mark Twain. Dove's subject does not have to be contemporary, but must have been alive during the last century. \"It might be inhibiting to actually meet them though,\" he said. \"As someone who composes operas, I spend a lot of time thinking about how human characteristics can be represented in music.\" The musical challenge is more than a ruse, Dove promises. \"I have a reasonable amount of time to do the work, so I am not going to be saying: 'Can you hear what it is yet?' or 'Here is one I prepared earlier'.\" The composer's own favourite musical portrait is of Verdi's Falstaff in the opera of that name. \"You can really see him,\" he said. The Radio 3 day will also feature Janacek's String Quartet No 2, Intimate Letters, inspired by his friendship with a woman 38 years his junior, and Debussy's Prelude General Lavine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
