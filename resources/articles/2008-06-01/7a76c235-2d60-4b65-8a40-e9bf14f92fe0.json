The phrase crops up umpteen times in the document published by the government when it launched a public consultation on the subject six months ago. \"Informal Adult Learning: Shaping The Way Ahead\" was an invitation to the public to chip in with its views, and an attempt to broaden the debate beyond publicly funded adult education. Perhaps it also aimed to limit the political damage caused by the loss of 1.4m publicly funded adult education places. From his earliest days in post, John Denham, the secretary for innovation, universities and skills, made it plain he was not going on the back foot over the drastic shrinkage of publicly funded adult education - the result of the government's decision to refocus funding on improving \"skills and qualification levels across the workforce\". Denham said he was \"not defensive about acknowledging that our decision to prioritise formal education is one of the drivers for the current debate on informal adult learning\". The consultation period has just ended and we must wait for the results. In the meantime, Education Guardian has had a taste of public opinion. Two months ago, I invited anyone who thought they were one of the 1.4 million to share their experiences of cutting ties with evening classes. I put the same request in the University of the Third Age newsletter. The response was vigorous. And among the scores of emails from up and down the country there were few, if any, references to \"informal\" learning. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary says informal means \"not done or made according to a regular or prescribed form; not observing forms; not according to order; irregular; unofficial; disorderly\". Those who wrote would clearly not have seen their courses and activities that way. \"I live in Warwickshire ... a county which has practically given up totally on adult education,\" says Maureen Hirsch. \"Older people, such as myself, can greatly benefit from adult education - not for employment but to help us with personal development, including feelings of mastery of something new, which can help to combat depression, which large numbers of older people suffer from. \"It can also assist people to be more active citizens, which was supposed to be one of the aims of this government with the Better Government for Older People Programme. It also assists in keeping people in touch with other human beings, and again this prevents isolation and mental distress.\" Scores of emails share this anger at the drying up of adult education and the loss of health and social benefits. Some writers stopped evening classes because of the expense, some because they would have had to start sitting exams if the classes were going to continue - and others have stopped for both reasons. Some classes were discontinued because people dropped out or, more often, because colleges anticipated a loss of funding. \"Given that the government has decreed that to save them money for our later care we must keep ourselves mentally and physically active, they seem to have no idea that evening classes offer just that - including sociability, learning a new skill, and getting out of the 'couch potato' syndrome,\" writes Anita Laird. Anna Vaught had to give up classes because she is \"one of millions of pensioners just above the breadline, so not entitled to support with college fees. The deprivation for single pensioners is appalling, as it leads to isolation, loneliness and ill health, resulting in greater expenditure for the NHS and social services. How short-sighted New Labour has become.\" Madeleine Hurst says that when she retired she had planned to join \"the previously excellent selection of courses offered by Leicestershire county council\". But most of these \"disappeared or became too expensive to be viable, some teachers even opting to rent rooms from a college to run a course independently\". Many who responded have discovered the University of the Third Age (U3A), and are delighted with it. Many prefer daytime to evening events, particularly if must travel to get there. One man says concentration is better earlier in the day. And the cost is much lower than for evening classes. But some people, while grateful for the U3A, say it cannot replace evening classes. U3A classes can be monthly and can have drawbacks: \"U3A provides a most useful educational programme very cheaply - of course, it uses volunteers,\" says Gwyn Jones. \"But the range of 'subjects' can be very limited: for instance, three Scrabble groups in one branch!\" Some people have set up their own classes, either taking their college tutor with them or hiring a new one. Occasionally, this has been done with the assistance of the college that has cut their course. \"I have attended a French class for many years and the fees were reduced when I reached 60,\" says Barry Malin. \"As East Riding council scrapped the scheme we set up our own class. We rented a village hall and paid the tutor the amount we would have normally paid for the over-60s. She was better off, the under-60s were delighted. The tutor and students haven't got endless, waste-of-time, form filling. I just went to improve and keep up my French - what's wrong with that?\" When Lesley Curbishley retired from full-time work, she wanted a class to \"keep me thinking\". Salisbury College, her local, offered only one course that wasn't either a craft or directed at a qualification. \"The course was a weekly two-hour session, Philosophy in Our Time. I really loved it and have been going regularly since.\" Two years ago, the college doubled the fees to \u00a3120 a term, at the behest of the government via the Learning and Skills Council - \"it didn't fit their rules of 'progression' or offer a qualification\". The course continued when the tutor rented a room and charged just \u00a347 per term. Now the course is at risk again, because the building is due to be made into flats: \"You certainly have to be determined if you want to study just for the sake of it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
