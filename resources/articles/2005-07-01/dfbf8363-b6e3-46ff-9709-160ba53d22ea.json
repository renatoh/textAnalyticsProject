The rail, coach and bus company, which runs 30% of UK passenger trains, said its rail division had seen operating profits rise to \u00a327.1m in the six months to June 30 from \u00a315m at the same time last year. The company attributed the rise to a 4% increase in the number of passengers using their services, attracted, it said, by improved punctuality and reliability. Services had been hit by the London bombings on July 7 but the company said it was too early to speculate on the long-term impact. The firm said overall pre-tax profits rose 47.5% to \u00a358.1m from \u00a339.4m a year earlier and said it expected to deliver full-year pre-tax earnings of more than \u00a3130m. Its share price dropped 15.5p to 878.5p following the announcement. Phil White, the chief executive of National Express, said: \"The important thing is that those earnings are based on really good operational performances. What our customers want more than anything else are buses and trains that turn up on time time.\" But Bob Crow, general secretary of the Rail Maritime and Transport union, said the profit increases were \"nothing short of obscene\" and showed the \"great rail rip-off\" in full steam. He said: \"More money than ever is now being siphoned out of the industry by privateers whose primary aim is not to provide a service but to make money for their shareholders.\" All but one of National Express' eight train franchises - Great Northern, c2c, one, Central Trains, Gatwick Express, Midland Mainline, Silverlink and Wessex Trains - featured in the top nine of the UK's best performing train companies last month. The company's coach division also performed well, with operating profits rising to \u00a34.1m from \u00a32.1m a year ago but the bus division, which operates in the West Midlands, Dundee and London, saw a fall in profits to \u00a318.2m from \u00a319.6m. Mr White said bus operations had been hit by a number of factors, including a one-off \u00a32.1m charge resulting from accounting changes, amendments to concessionary bus travel and the closure of Rover's plant at Longbridge, which led to a fall in passenger numbers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
