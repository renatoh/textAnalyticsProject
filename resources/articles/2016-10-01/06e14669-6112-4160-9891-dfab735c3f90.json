In a new report, published on Monday, the CBI will highlight the economic and social challenges facing the UK that have been \u201cthrown into sharp relief by Brexit\u201d and focus on issues of productivity and inclusion. \u201cWith UK productivity second from bottom of the G7, employee engagement is now more than ever crucial to driving productivity. But here too there\u2019s a problem. Of the world\u2019s 12 largest economies the UK ranks ninth for levels of engagement,\u201d said Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI. \u201cRaising engagement isn\u2019t about slapping another zero on the budget for the staff Christmas party. It\u2019s a complex process which takes time and hard work,\u201d he said. Philip Hammond, appointed chancellor after the Brexit vote, has vowed to improve Britain\u2019s lacklustre productivity. Data from earlier this month showed UK productivity was 27, 30 and 35 percentage points lower than in France, the US and Germany respectively. In a speech, Drechsler will highlight the importance of the recruitment process to get people with the correct skills into jobs to increase productivity and make the workplace inclusive. He described \u201cunconscious bias\u201d as a big challenge. \u201cThe first time many come into contact with this in the workplace is during job applications. One of the ways of tackling this is name-blind applications, removing criteria that could unintentionally bias managers and give under-represented groups confidence that their application will be fairly considered,\u201d he said. The CBI is looking at introducing such a practice and its report comes after a move a year ago by employers such as banking group HSBC, the BBC and accountants KPMG \u2013 and the university application scheme Ucas \u2013 to commit to disregard an employee\u2019 name. The CBI also cited statistics from the CIPD showing that one in five female jobseekers from an ethnic minority have changed their name on a job application. \u201cFlexible working can be a vital enabler too. It\u2019s time we stopped seeing flexible working as a \u2018bonus for staff\u2019 and started seeing it as something which has clear benefits for employers and employees alike. It helps everyone balance their working lives not just with their responsibilities as parents or carers but also with their wellbeing and interests outside of work,\u201d said Drechsler."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
