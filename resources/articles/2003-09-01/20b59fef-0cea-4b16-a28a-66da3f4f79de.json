It commemorates the death 13 years ago of Jackie Moore in the Sheraton Heliopolis Hotel fire in Egypt. During her 30 years in fashion journalism, Moore demonstrated great generosity of spirit in encouraging newcomers, both writers and designers. As an experienced commentator, she was highly regarded for her knowledge and fair, balanced outlook on fashion. One aspiring fashion journalist will win an all-expenses-paid visit to the Paris haute couture collections in January 2004 and the opportunity to write a report on the shows, which will be published on the Guardian style pages. To enter, answer both the following questions, in not more than 500 words each. The judges are looking for observation, originality and wit. 1. When money is short, what would it take for you to buy a luxury fashion item? 2. What makes you think you are fashionable? \u00b7 Entries must be submitted to the Jackie Moore Award for Fashion Journalism, PO Box 31397, London SW11 5YR by Friday November 14 2003. The winner will be announced in the Guardian on Friday December 12. Applicants should state their name, age, sex, occupation, address and telephone number. Entries should be typewritten. Entry is open to anyone with no more than one year's experience in fashion writing. There is no age limit. The judges are Jess Cartner-Morley, fashion editor, the Guardian; Iain R Webb, fashion director, Elle; Sarah Mower, contributing editor, American Vogue; Francesca Fearon, fashion editor, Hello!; and Harriet Quick, fashion features editor, Vogue, who is a previous winner of the award. Last year's winner, Simon Chilvers, writes: \"A trip to Paris haute couture is a guaranteed week of eye-dazzling fashion antics, dramatic frocks and eccentricities galore. It is a prize packed with drama from beginning to end. But the spectacle of couture, while breathtaking, isn't what is at the heart of the Jackie Moore award. Beneath all the glamour there is an article to write and, for me, this was the biggest buzz of all. For anyone desperate to carve a role for themselves in this highly competitive industry, the thrill of producing a feature for the Guardian style pages, on a laptop from your hotel room, cannot be underestimated. Along the way, I picked up loads of tips about writing while gaining insider knowledge about how the fashion system works, and still had time to slug a few glasses of champagne and check out Isabella Blow's outfits on a daily basis. What more could a fledging fashion writer dream of?\" Overexposed Von Dutch Arsenal's gallic super striker Thierry Henry has clearly been watching too much MTV this summer. This must be why he thinks it acceptable to wear the same red and grey Von Dutch trucker cap in each and every interview since the football season started. Thierry, you look a fool! The Danish utilitywear label Von Dutch, named after the American artist who died in 1992, is hot property in the US, with celebrity aficionados including Gwen Stefani (left), Britney, Justin, P Diddy and, er, Tom Green all sporting the collectable caps. But in the English Premiership, the look just doesn't quite work. According to Gunners insiders, the cap is part of Thierry's \"warming down\" process and he won't remove the offending headwear until he is safely on the team coach. So what's the French for va va voom? Von Dutch, I guess. Alice Leeburn Overheard \"Dressing down\" The ability to make expensive designer clothes look like cheap market tat. Eg, \"Lordy, Catherine Zeta-Jones gave her frock a real dressing down at the premiere.\" See also: Penelope Cruz or any member of the royal family"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
