Icstis says it is expecting a big rise in calls from rogue telephone companies using illegal automated calling equipment (ACE) to leave tempting messages over this weekend. Callers who ring the number listed at the end of the message dial a premium rate number usually costing \u00a31.50 a minute. In most cases the prizes are non-existent or not as promised. Icstis says it has seen the number of complaints about ACE-linked premium lines jump from 110 in 2003 to more than 2,200 in 2004. \"We are concerned that lots of people - particularly children - will be at home at Easter and might be tempted to call the number in the mistaken belief that they have won a prize. Companies are not allowed to use automated calling equipment - the message should be deleted and ignored,\" said an Icstis spokeswoman. Many of the companies using ACE to entice callers are based outside the UK. Icstis operates a free helpline 0800 500 212 or go to www.icstis.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
