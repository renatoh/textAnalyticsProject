Eight players made four or less as Simon Harmer, brought on in the fourth over after an injury to Sam Cook, finished with seven for 38, and 12 for 61 in the match, to become the leading wicket-taker in Division One with 42. Essex themselves had been bowled out before lunch thanks to tireless efforts from Kyle Abbott, but that was but a bean compared with what was to come. Yorkshire\u2019s middle order suffered against Warwickshire at the first County Championship match at York since 1890, losing five for eight in 10 overs. There were ducks for Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Jack Leaning and Jordan Thompson, as Gary Ballance yet again propped up the batting with 54. Craig Miles took four for 32, Oliver Hannon-Dalby three for 60. Zak Crawley\u2019s 111 was the shining light around which Kent\u2019s tail were drawn, after five of their top six were out in single figures against Nottinghamshire. Four days after being bowled out for 59 by Somerset, Kent were 119 for six at Tunbridge Wells. But Crawley found backup from Grant Stewart and Harry Podmore, and they cobbled together a third batting point. James Pattinson did the damage with six for 73. Notts were 30 for 0 at the close. In Division Two, Sam Robson and Paul Stirling made hundreds as Middlesex passed 400. In reply, Glamorgan recovered from a second-ball run-out, with a Marnus Labuschagne 50. At Derby play did not start until after lunch, but that was plenty of time for Lancashire\u2019s Jimmy Anderson (five for 18), and Graham Onions (three for 19) to take a scythe to Derbyshire\u2019s batting. From 24 for five, the tail wagged to 153 all out. Keaton Jennings was out lbw for a duck before the close. A partnership of 320 between Neil Dexter and Hasan Azad, a first-class record for Leicestershire\u2019s second wicket, put them firmly on top against Gloucestershire. Worcestershire\u2019s scheduled game against Sussex was moved to Kidderminster and now starts today after flood water swamped New Road. A ridiculous day\u2019s cricket at Chelmsford, and plenty more collapses from York to Canterbury, with a bit of Derby on the side. Thanks for all your comments, looking forward to reading about Lancashire\u2019s batting tomorrow - Graham\u2019s classy and knowledgeable hands take over from the front row of the probably very cold press tent in York. Have a lovely evening, good night! A few final thoughts before I write up - Glamorgan recovering, as we\u2019ve now come to expect, 78 for one. And Notts starting well - four for 0. Hampshire\u2019s head coach Adi Birrell is still shaking his head at Chelmsford. \u201cWe had four overs to bat before lunch and lost a wicket straight away, Ajinkya got a first baller, so we were on the back foot right from the start. \u201cHarmer bowls fairly well but the ball wasn\u2019t turning square, it wasn\u2019t impossible to bat. \u201cJoe Weatherley batted through. He applied himself and needed someone to bat through with him. \u201cIt is a painful and hurtful result. We have had a talk in the dressing room and we have to take it on the chin. Hopefully it is a defeat in isolation. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to let this affect us. It was a very bad two days. \u201cWe had three wins and a couple of draws and it had been okay up until now. We need to get back onto the horse. \u201cWe are not proud of what happened but we can\u2019t fall in a heap. We need to get off the floor and dust ourselves down.\u201d Derbyshire 96 for 8 - If Anderson (5-14) don\u2019t get you Onions (3-17) must. Has anyone else seen the big bus advert with Rashid Khan advertising money exchange or some such? A career-best at Grace Road and I see that a Notts-up is imminent at Tunbridge Wells with Kent 288 for nine. Just checked out the Nottinghamshire team - Peter Moores has stuck with Joe Clarke, though his place must be hanging by a thread. Canterbury last week, Chelmsford this week. That little corner of south-east England is a bowlers\u2019 paradise. Two hundreds at Grace Road! Neil Dexter 159 not out and Hasan Azad 110 not out. Record breaking too -comfortably beating Leicestershire\u2019s previous highest second-wicket partnership against Gloucestershire, 153 by Barry Dudleston and Chris Balderstone at Bristol in 1979. I just hope there\u2019s a few people there to see it. David Willey having fun at York - six fours in his 35 not out. Yorks 169 for seven. James Pattinson\u2019s marvellous day getting better after he bowls Zak Crawley for 111. He now has 6 for 73. Crawley catching the eye again with runs while the others fall about him. I\u2019m not sure quite how they managed it but Glamorgan are 0-1. Selman run out. Right, back now till write-up time. Daniel\u2019s done an amazing job! Killed off Essex and overseen a resurgent Yorkshire. Derbyshire must be happyish with 86 for five from the ruins of their start. Glamorgan are nearly through Middlesex, De Lange having Sowter caught by Cullen for 24. The last pair are together with the score 409-9. Leicestershire are piling them on at Grace Road and Hasan Azad is nearing a century, 93 not out; his team are 243-1. After a flurry of wickets up and down the country, we\u2019re now consolidating. At 82-5, Derbyshire are literally flying. At Taunton, Sheldon Cottrell has just nailed a ludicrous run out, off his own bowling, to send Tamim Iqbal back to the pavilion. Make sure to look it up. Derbyshire are fighting back against Lancashire, now 72-5. Hughes and Critchley have made 22 and 26 respectively, their partnership 48. It\u2019s on. They\u2019re taking tea at Canterbury with Kent at 236-8. Notts will be the happier side, I\u2019d say. Uge wicket at haitch cue! Labuschagne has bowled Stirling for 138, and Middlesex are 394-8. Yorkshire have taken tea on 139-6. At the crease are Ballance and Willey, 52 not out and 22 not out respectively, so Warwickshire still have plenty of work to do. At Grace Road, Leicestershire have taken tea in a pleasant spot; they\u2019re 210-1 against Gloucestershire, with Azad 73 not out and Dexter unbeaten on 128. At Canterbury, Kent have lost a couple of wickets, Pattinson knocking over both Stewart and Rayner for 59 and 0 respectively. Crawley is still there but, 100 not out, and the score now is 226-8. That win for Essex puts them third in the division one table, on 85 points. They\u2019re six ahead of Yorkshire, seven behind Hants and 30 off Somerset. Test cricket\u2019s lowest bat-carrying score is 26* \u2013 recorded at Newlands by Bernard Tancred of South Africa, against England in 1889, What am I saying! Crane has gone for 20 and Edwards for a duck, both to Harmer who finishes with 7-38! Weatherley carries his bat for the aforementioned 29. Hants, 88-8 in their second innings, now trail Essex, who have batted only once, by eight runs. Weatherley, who opened is 29 not out, and I\u2019m guessing that people have carried bats for less but nonetheless that\u2019s a decently meagre total. Derbyshire 28 for five... Onions 3-9, Anderson 2-9...while Yorkshire recover to 111 for six, thanks once again to Gary Ballance (45 and counting) At Lord\u2019s, Middlesex are 362-7 against Glamorgan; Labuschagne has just trapped Helm for 8. All this must be great preparation for the flat tracks you find in Test cricket. Yorkshire have also lost a wicket against Warwickshire, Hannon-Dalby getting his third to see Thompson away for a duck. The score is now 107-6. When you\u2019re 21-4 what you really need is England\u2019s greatest-ever bowler running in, and that\u2019s exactly what Derby have got. And guess what? James Anderson has bowled Harvey Hosein, whose boys are now 26-5. Wicket! Graham Onions has a third, trapping Tom Lace leg before. He made 4, and his team are now 21-4. Hants are in all sorts, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ve seen the shine off now and have arrived at the shining uplands. Derbyshire are rebuilding, now 15-3. Where\u2019s Kim Barnett when you need him? Hi everyone - Daniel Harris stepping in until Tanya\u2019s return. I\u2019m going to be slightly distracted for the next hour, and oh my , Derbyshire are 14 for 3. .. Yorkies, Yorkies! 94 for four as they lose three for one. Ducks for Kohler-Cadmore and Leaning. Weatherley hanging on, 19 not out at the top of the Hampshire order and Abbott\u2019s thwacked three fours and a six in his 18 - not surprised he\u2019s a little mad with his batsmen... Harmer 5-11.... Hampshire 32 for 6 and looking likely to be all out, game over, before a three o\u2019clock old-school ciggie break. Harmer now 4 for 11. A third for Pattinson at Tunbridge Wells, Kent 151 for 6. Yorkshire off to a flyer, Fraine and Ballance whipping them along to 81 for one. And Paul Stirling 94 not out at Radlett. Derbyshire currently 0-0, it could be as good as it gets. Soap on a rope Hampshire! Porter 2-11, Harmer 2-7, Hampshire 26 for four. Derby will bat first when the teams finally get out - nasty line up for the batsman to contemplate over hot-pot. Arjun Tendulkar, 19 year old son of Sachin, in action against that powerful Surrey second XI this morning. Interesting things afoot at Chelmsford - it looks like the game will be over in two days. Hampshire now 5-2 in their second innings -those 91 runs for parity seem a long, long, way away. Good news! They\u2019ll be able to start the match at 2.30 at Derby, where a South African batting great has appeared. And some of KP\u2019s best work tonight on National Geographic at 9pm. Division One day two Chelmsford: Essex 214 (Bopara 59, Lawrence 57; Abbott 4-54) v Hampshire 118 all out (Harmer 5-23) &amp; 5-1. Tunbridge Wells: Kent 105-5 (Crawley 54 not out) v Nottinghamshire lunch will be taken at 1.30 -York: Yorkshire 47-1 v Warwickshire Division Two Radlett: Middlesex 272-4 (Robson 107) v Glamorgan Derby: Derby v Lancashire. No play yet today. Grace Road: Leicestershire 89-1 (Dexter 63 not out) v Gloucestershire A cat picture from Taunton before lunch - scores to follow. Bit of news: Sussex have signed former Warwickshire all-rounder Aaron Thomason. And a fourth has just fallen at Tunbridge Wells - Kent 89 for four. Fletcher now has two for 27. Robson out for 107 at Radlett, Middx 259/4 and Neil Dexter - 62 off 72 balls - making batting look easy at Grace Road, Leicestershire 86/1. Oh, Essex have had rather a collapse. They\u2019ve just lost five for 18 - Abbot a spell of three in nine balls, Edwards two in two. Essex 212/9. It\u2019s always lovely to get an email. Finbar writes from Milan: \u201cMorning Tanya, just reflecting on what a great moment it is to be a Somerset fan; The Royal London already under our belt, a 26 point lead in the championship and no stress today as we\u2019re not even playing but our nearest rivals are (and they\u2019re struggling). Feels a bit weird for things to be going so well ...... a bit like England going into the World Cup as favourites. By the way sounds like quite an atmosphere at Old Trafford yesterday.\u201d It all is looking rather fabulous for Somerset. I\u2019ve glanced at their fixture list. The last three games are v Yorkshire at Taunton, v Hampshire at the Ageas and v Essex at Taunton. Would it be terrible jinxing to hope they don\u2019t clinch it at Southampton? And it was an amazing atmosphere at Old Trafford - just a joy to see so many people totally in love with the game, or even with that game - it didn\u2019t matter. Great stat from Nick Hoult, and I may have fallen off the biscuit wagon. They were a lot better than custard creams though - big fat shortbreads in whacking great fingers and tetrahedrons. They\u2019re due to restart at 12.45 at York, with 13 overs lost to the rain; and at Derby the day is slipping away - a further inspection at 1.30. Lyth didn\u2019t last long at York, and nor did play. Off for rain, with Yorkshire 9 for one. And congratulations to Sam Robson, 101 not out, his first first-class hundred this season - against Glamorgan. Delving into cricinfo\u2019s archive of goodies, he made 37 in the last of his seven Tests, against India in 2014. Since then England have tried Adam Lyth, Keaton Jennings, Haseeb Hameed, Rory Burns and Mark Stoneman up the order alongside Alastair Cook. Have I missed anyone? Sensational picture from York - squint hard and look at all those hardy souls in the stand. Defiance in the face of the elements. Wishing you seasonable warmth. Bit of a nasty shock for the MCC Young Cricketers: Ravi Bopara has been dismissed for 59 at Chelmsford, Essex 174-4; a second for Pattinson at Tunbridge Wells, Denly lbw; Yorkshire are batting at York - so far, so good. And in division two, Sam Robson is on the brink - 98 not out. One thing: here they come at York for the time since Vincent van Gogh died and the Forth bridge was opened to trains. Enough now before I fall down a wormhole. Second thing: look, LOOK!, at these shadows at Radlett. An excellent round-up of the current Championship situation by Gary Naylor. Ball six is slam in the slot - and I learnt a new word: \u201dautochthonous.\u201d At Derby, there will be no play before lunch, with a further inspection at 12.20, and at York the pitter patter of raindrops has ended and play will start in five minutes. Thanks for the kick BTL. Here is Moeen Ali\u2019s latest column, and rather lovely it is too. World Cup news update: Jason Roy will miss England\u2019s next two World Cup matches, but Eoin Morgan might be fit for England\u2019s game against Afghanistan tomorrow. And Chadd Sayers makes a breakthrough at Grace Road, having Paul Horton caught behind for nothing at all . Leicestershire 6/1. And Kent lose a wicket to the third ball of the match: Sean Dickson caught behind off James Pattinson for four. Kent 4 for one. Alas poor York, where it has just started raining again. Wise, kind and measured words from Nasser Hussain. And at Taunton for Bangladesh v West Indies, it is not raining and no rain is forecast! It\u2019s a must win game for both sides - follow it here with John Ashdown and later Geoff Lemon. Rain watch: things are looking up. All certainly more cheery than for my 13 year old, who was delighted to be missing school today with a game, only for the match to be called off and him to have to go to school unprepared for a geography exam. I want it on record that I had pointed out that this was a possibility. Anyway: Division One Chelmsford: no word yet. Tunbridge Wells: play due to start on time. No rain expected today York: play due to start on time. Grey. Division Two Radlett: I see sunshine via twitter. Play will start on time. Derby: delayed start with an inspection at 11am. Wet outfield. Grace Road: play is due to start at 11am. Cloudy. The last time first-class cricket was played in York was 1890, when Lord Hawke ruled the roost. At York, where the skies look, um, slate Duanne Olivier is rested after the hip strain he picked up at Guildford. Tim Bresnan, Matthew Waite and Jared Warner are also injured, but David Willey returns. Henry Brookes and Ryan Sidebottom miss out for Warwickshire. Kent are strengthened by Wiaan Mulder but Sam Billings (shoulder), Calum Haggett (elbow) and Ivan Thomas (knee) are all out with injury. Notts are resting Stuart Broad at the ECB\u2019s request , as Notts return to Tunbridge Wells for the first time since they won the title in 2010. Division Two Derbyshire have named an unchanged squad to face the leaders. Richard Gleeson makes the Lancashire squad after being rested last week but there is no space for leg-spinner Matt Parkinson . Wicketkeeper Lewis Hill returns for Leicestershire and Will Davis and Callum Parkinson are also included in a 13-man squad. Gloucestershire are unchanged. And a New Road update - there was supposed to be a game there - Worcestershire v Sussex starting today. But because of the flooding, the game has been switched to Kidderminster and will start tomorrow. Just been reading up on yesterday. Essex rested Peter Siddle who is suffering from a twinge and brought back Adam Wheater, who has missed ten weeks with a thumb injury. Simon Harmer\u2019s five wicket haul was his fourth in five CC games. He now has 35 first-class wickets at 19.4 -the same number as Lewis Gregory and Jeetan Patel, annointed kings of the Div One ball. And Radlett is a happy hunting ground for Sam Robson. His 85 is his highest first-class score of the season, his only century of the season came in a RL Cup game there against Somerset. Welcome back to the county circuit, where life goes on behind the bombast and brilliance, and rain, relentless rain, of the World Cup. Here is the soggy scene at New Road, where Worcester were due to play Sussex. Lots of counties have scheduled this week for festival games - Radlett is holding its first ever Championship game, Kent entertain at Tunbridge Wells and York holds its first game of first-class cricket for 129 years. Four games start today, two - Middlesex v Glamorgan and Essex v Hampshire -started yesterday. At Chelmsford Simon Harmer decimated Hampshire and Sam Robson batted out two soggy sessions against Glamorgan. Division One day two Chelmsford: Essex 147-3 (Bopara 50 not out) v Hampshire 118 all out (Harmer 5-23) Tunbridge Wells: Kent v Nottinghamshire York: Yorkshire v Warwickshire Division Two Radlett: Middlesex 151-3 (Robson 85 not out) v Glamorgan Derby: Derby v Lancashire Grace Road: Leicestershire v Gloucestershire"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
