His trip down cinematic memory lane, though, is surprisingly short on laughs and long on entertaining biographical anecdotes and blow-by-blow commentaries on the pratfalls of the era's surviving films. Merton trawls through the lives of Chaplin, Keaton and the rest, but concedes he's not covering new ground. For all his passion , it's hard not to keep thinking that the best way to enjoy these fi lms is to watch them. To that end, Merton is touring the UK showing excerpts of his favourites and screening a print of Keaton's Steamboat Bill Jr."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
