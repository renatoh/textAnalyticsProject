It's the noughties equivalent of a twinset and pearls: the grown woman's default, people-pleasing choice when she doesn't want her outfit to make a lot of noise. Frankly, if you want to look edgy, these days you are better off wearing peach. But many stylish people stick doggedly to the palette favoured by Darth Vader. After all, black has a lot going for it: it makes you look thinner, doesn't get grubby, and bridges the day-to-night divide better than any colour. The only thing it no longer does is give you an edge. To combat this, I have noticed a trend among people in the fashion industry (many of whom are oddly literal-minded for a supposedly creative bunch) towards wearing black with lots of edges. This is how it works. To make black cool again, the look has to be a bit jagged. So you might wear narrow trousers with high, strappy platforms or pancake-flat ballerina pumps, either of which creates a dramatic silhouette that is tough rather than elegant. The move towards sharp angles can be seen in winter knitwear. A few years ago, most women's black sweaters were round or scoop-necked, all soft lines and bosoms. Then the V-neck took over, a more masculine shape. In the past two winters, the trend towards sweaters-with-attitude has continued apace: we now have mega-knits, with loops so big that slipping through the eye of a needle suddenly seems a distinct possibility; or cardigan-blazers, with smart, shiny buttons. And then, on top of your black knit, you wear a black jacket with crisp shoulders and lapels sharp as shards of glass. And there you have it: black is back on the dark side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
