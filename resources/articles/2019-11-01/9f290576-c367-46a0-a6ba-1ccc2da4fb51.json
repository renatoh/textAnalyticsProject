That was great. We\u2019re disappointed we didn\u2019t win at the end. The boys will have learnt a lesson but they had the character to stay in the game.\u201d Manchester United\u2019s manager set more store by such spirit than the critical tactical switch he made at half time when he withdrew the struggling defender Phil Jones and switched from a malfunctioning 3-4-3 formation to a flat back four. \u201cWe had to change the system and go for it second half,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to put another attacker on. But today wasn\u2019t about tactics you\u2019ve got to earn the game and we didn\u2019t have any right to win it after 70 minutes. Today was about fighting back and getting first to the ball. The way we turned the bad 70 minutes into a positive is good.\u201dWilder was sanguine after seeing his side shine while leading through goals from John Fleck and the excellent Lys Mousset. \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s a 90-minute rather than 71-minute game,\u201d said Sheffield United\u2019s manager. \u201cWe just dropped our energy levels at the wrong time; 2-0 is a dangerous score-line. And you\u2019ve got understand the quality you\u2019re up against in this division.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
