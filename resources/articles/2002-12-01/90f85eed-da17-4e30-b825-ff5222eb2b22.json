European football's governing body hit him with the news he had been dreading after he was sent to the stand by French referee Claude Colombo against Celta Vigo last week. But Hoops chief executive Ian McLeod has jumped to the defence of his manager by announcing that he would be launching an appeal against the \"unreasonable\" punishment. \"We believe that the punishment does not fit the supposed crime and that the decision of UEFA's disciplinary committee against Martin O'Neill is both draconian and unreasonable. We will definitely be appealing,\" he fumed. O'Neill's dismissal means he will be absent from the dugout for the second leg in Spain on Thursday when the UEFA Cup third-round tie is decided. It is the animated Celtic manager's second run-in with UEFA having been sent to the stand following the Hoops' controversial defeat to Juventus in Turin last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
