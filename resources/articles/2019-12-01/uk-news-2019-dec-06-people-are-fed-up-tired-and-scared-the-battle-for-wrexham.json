I never thought I\u2019d say that. We\u2019ve had so many governments over the last 300 years and nobody\u2019s got it right. We\u2019re still all arguing about how to run the country. We need to rip it all up and start again.\u201d Hopwood is not your archetypal rebel. After his mining career ended, he worked as a carer and then devoted himself to looking after his wife, Theresa, until she died three years ago. Now he is searching for something different for his country, a fresh start, and his way of making a point seems to be to cast his vote for something that goes against what he has believed in all his life. When the coal mines thrived Wrexham was indubitably Labour. The party has held the seat since 1935 and in the mid-1970s had a majority of more than 16,000. In 2017 this fell to a little over 1,800 and the Tories strongly believe they can cause a huge shock next week by winning in Wrexham and other longtime Labour strongholds. Hopwood lives on the edge of the Caia Park estate, a key battleground in the campaign. One part of the estate is in the top 10 of the poorest in Wales and is the most educationally deprived spot in the country. Eirian Hughes, 50, was on her doorstep of her house in Caia Park smoking a cigarette before heading off for the 3pm-midnight shift cleaning at the Eagles Meadow shopping centre. She and her partner both work to enjoy the nights out and the holidays that two wages pay for. \u201cWe work hard for the life we want,\u201d Hughes said. She doesn\u2019t see herself as particularly rich or poor. \u201cWe\u2019re somewhere in the middle.\u201d In the past Hughes has voted for both Labour and Tory but plumped for Ukip in 2015 when Nigel Farage\u2019s party came a solid third in Wrexham. \u201cThe Conservatives and Labour say they\u2019ll fight for us but we\u2019re nothing to them.\u201d Hughes was among the 59% of the electorate in Wrexham who backed leave in the referendum. She insists she is not racist but rages against the town\u2019s Polish and Portuguese residents, who she claims take jobs from local people. She also complains about the town\u2019s hospital, Wrexham Maelor, and was horrified by the story of a 70-year-old man who died after waiting in an ambulance outside the hospital for eight hours. \u201cIs that going to happen to me in the end?\u201d asked Hughes. \u201cYou pay national insurance from the day you leave school. And it comes to that.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even think she\u2019ll bother to vote this time. On the face of it, Wrexham should be a straight fight between Labour and Tory but it is complex. Though the parliamentary seat has been Labour for more than 80 years, Wrexham council is run by a Tory/independent coalition. One council officer, who asked not to be named, summed up the ruling group as an \u201causterity masochist Conservative coalition\u201d \u2013 but added that there was no life in the Labour opposition. Another complicating factor is that policy areas like health and education are the responsibility of the Welsh Labour government. With many different parties to blame, it is no surprise allegiances have become so fluid. When the Guardian asked residents which issues were most important to them, Brexit was by no means at the top of everyone\u2019s list. Respondents expressed concerns about the state of the hospital, the impact of austerity, homelessness, the struggles of AFC Wrexham (the third oldest professional football team in the world but currently floundering in the fifth tier of the English pyramid) and, perhaps most strikingly, the number of people for whom hunger is a pressing concern. \u201cSix months ago I think it was all about Brexit,\u201d said 30-year-old Bill Long, who was born and bred in Wrexham. \u201cI think people are now realising, hang on, we\u2019ve had three prime ministers under the Conservatives since Brexit and things are getting worse. People are very fed up, tired and scared.\u201d As a teacher at St Christopher\u2019s in Wrexham, the largest special school in Wales, Long sees the pressure on the most vulnerable. Some pupils come into school hungry and he says teachers dip into their own pockets to feed them. Long has sometimes brought in a toaster and bread to make sure there\u2019s a snack on the go at break-times. Teachers and teaching assistants don\u2019t like to talk about the hand-outs. \u201cIt\u2019s an unspoken thing but it goes on,\u201d said Long. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that should happen.\u201d At the Trussell Trust food bank on a Wrexham industrial estate, Sally Ellinson was supervising the preparation of emergency Christmas food boxes. Two years ago the agencies who refer people to the food bank asked for 200 boxes. Now the number is 500. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure we can fulfil all those referrals but we\u2019ll do our best,\u201d she said. It is not that there are no jobs in Wrexham. Most people agree that if you want work, you will find it. But more than half the people who use the food bank have jobs. \u201cPeople coming in are embarrassed and ashamed,\u201d said Ellinson. \u201cBut most haven\u2019t eaten for a couple of days and are hungry.\u201d There are many good people trying to help. In the town centre, carer and Salvation Army volunteer Dawn was on her way to a shift at a food bank distribution centre. She stopped to buy the rough sleepers outside McDonald\u2019s porridge and cheesy bacon flatbreads. Dawn said she was a long-term Labour voter but she too was going to vote for the Brexit party this time. \u201cI want Brexit done. Let\u2019s leave and then we can focus on other things \u2013 the disgrace that is universal credit, the humiliation people face when applying for PIP (personal independence payment), the problems in schools, the long waiting lists in hospitals.\u201d A number of people who contacted the Guardian flagged up the decline of the town centre and the drug-takers on the streets. There are many empty shops in the town centre and drug users are a common sight but dig deeper and there are inspiring things happening too. The building that occupies numbers 9-11 on Regent Street used to be a JJB Sports but is now an art space called UnDegUn (eleven in Welsh). It hosts exhibitions, poetry readings, debates and the Wrexham bands Baby Brave and Neck Deep rehearse here. Dave Gray, 44, the founder of UnDegUn, is one of the few people the Guardian spoke to in Wrexham who was voting for the party he had always supported \u2013 Labour. \u201cI feel I have to vote Labour. Its manifesto is optimistic, l like that, it\u2019s brave. They seem to want to make a difference.\u201d Across town in the politics department of the further and higher education college, Coleg Cambria, a teacher predicted most of the 18-year-olds voting for the first time would back Labour. It turned out not be so. Of five students interviewed only one was definitely voting for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party. Two were opting for the Tories, one for the Welsh nationalists, Plaid Cymru. They were interested in the environment, university fees, the economy. Cait Williams said she was \u201ccompletely conflicted\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think the politicians in London get north Wales,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re in their Westminster bubble. I want to vote in a passionate way for someone I genuinely believe in. But I\u2019m not sure who that is at the moment. I\u2019ll have to do some more research.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
