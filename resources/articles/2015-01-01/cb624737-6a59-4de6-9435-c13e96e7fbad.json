The former enshrines the Irish language as the national and first official language of Ireland and the latter acknowledges the right to life of the unborn (Pregnant woman\u2019s life support can be switched off, 27 December, page 17). \u2022 In a feature article on Ed Sheeran, a quote about the singer\u2019s boy-next-door image being a potent attribute for an artist in 2014 was mistakenly attributed to Keith Negus, professor of musicology at Goldsmiths, University of London. In fact, it was a professor of music at Oxford University, Eric Clarke, who was both interviewed and quoted (From boy next door to king of the world, 1 January, page 3). \u2022 King\u2019s Cross, the station worst affected by disruption to train services over the Christmas period, is not overseen by David Ward, Network Rail\u2019s route managing director for the south-east, contrary to what we suggested (OBE for Christmas travel chaos boss, 31 December, page 2). We have also been asked to clarify that the departure and severance package of Network Rail\u2019s managing director of network operations, Robin Gisby, was agreed in November, and did not relate to the problems at Christmas. \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Calais\u2019 desperate migrants are dying \u2013 politicians must intervene urgently Londoners miss out as homes built as \u2018safe deposit boxes\u2019 for foreign buyers Abandon all Hope?
