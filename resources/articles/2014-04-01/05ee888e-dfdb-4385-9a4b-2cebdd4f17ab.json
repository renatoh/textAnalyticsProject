The Globe is popular, the National updating, the Donmar intense. So RSC artistic director Gregory Doran and his deputy, Erica Whyman, have a cunning plan. Two, in fact. All 36 of Shakespeare's plays are being performed over six years, which is welcome, though not much of a surprise. More enterprisingly, in the Swan \u2013 originally intended as a stage for the work of Shakespeare's contemporaries \u2013 Whyman is stewarding a season of Jacobethan dramas which feature tremendous female parts. The \"roaring girl\" of Thomas Dekker and Thomas Middleton's 1611 play was based on a real-life cross-dresser, Moll Cutpurse. This \"notorious baggage\", accused of thieving, drunkenness and \"displaying herself at the theatre'', asked at her death to be buried in Fleet Street bum-upwards. Her swagger, independence and sheer unexpectedness should be enough to galvanise a play. Yet it's hard to rejoice in the spurts of vigour here. Director Jo Davies and RSC literary manager Pippa Hill have edited the text of the two Thomases, cutting out characters and simplifying some phrases, but they have not subdued the straggle of the plot. This never quite throws up a theme, though every now and then it asserts an argument about the uselessness of men and the fickleness of women. A tale of young lovers thwarted by a dominating father sits beside the extramarital shenanigans of a young wife and her fussy hubby. The antics are made harder to follow by the interventions of a lowlife called Ralph Trapdoor (the names are good but not up to the standards of Restoration comedy). They are loosely bound together by the figure of Moll, who has a purer moral profile than her real-life counterpart, and who makes a bold stand against all this marrying malarkey. Lisa Dillon, one of the most chameleon-like of actresses, skips nimbly through a range of ambi-gendered costumes. She could pass for a dapper fellow with her spivvy thin moustache and three-piece suit; she is more sexually provoking in tight jeans and tattoos. She delivers her sceptical speeches and vows of independence with an easy conviction. Still, she is undermined by the director's decision to update this city comedy, so explicit about London, to the late Victorian age. Davies hopes to emphasise the sexual political debate and make evident the \"exuberant materialism\" that drives part of the plot. It's a wretched decision, and a muddled one. The stage may be inhabited by men in check suits and bowlers, and women in silken flounces, but the language remains Jacobean while a band (all women) plays 21st-century music on sax, trumpet bass and drums; Dillon herself performs a rap. The sloppiness of this \u2013 let's put anything female together \u2013 would matter less if the play were funny. But the wan language (very apparent to an audience used to Shakespeare) is compounded by clumsy stage business and an exaggerated, jokey acting style. Time and again a speech is delivered as if it were building up to a \"boom boom\" punchline. Not so much a roar as a strangled mew. Doran's productions of Henry IV Parts I and II exemplifies what the feminist Swan season is up against. Battles, brown scenery and big boots. The two plays are not the most raucous or bloody of Shakespeare's dramas, but as dynastic dramas they are among the most thoroughly male. The first part, before the later scenes of mellow melancholy, is particularly testosterone-drenched: it's a long time before women make their way on to the stage, and when they do so they are mainly there to lull or to be laid. Doran's staging \u2013 traditional, robust, lots of running, heavy-handed with the overrated pranks played by the Prince (Alex Hassell) and his roisterers \u2013 makes the complications of inheritance and feuding very clear. At the opening of Part I, when the stage is lit by candlelight and rings to the music of a bass chorus, the figure of Richard II appears on high, looking down on the proceedings. The undertow that gives a personal dimension to dynasty is also apparent. The claims of the men who are in different ways fathers to the Prince \u2013 the official and the emotional, Henry IV and Falstaff \u2013 are unusually evenly balanced. In a production marked by alarming hair (Pistol looks like Eraserhead), Antony Sher's huge grey mane makes his head look enormous, and increases the illusion of fatness. His first words, spoken when drunk, loll out of his mouth as if they could hardly be bothered to make the exit. He continues with only slight acceleration, deliberate and plummy-voiced. Sher does not overflow: he constructs. This makes him very good at Falstaff's tricks and tales and fabrications, but less than mighty in emotional confrontation. Hal's denial of him (\"I know thee not, old man\") is not as terrible as it should be. Unusually, this King Henry is an old man who does become known. Jasper Britton comes close to overdoing it in his often agitated and finally choke-voiced performance, but he does succeed in making the king look like the main man in his own play. Paola Dionisotti \u2013 wrung out as if she were a string of dirty rags blown in from a Hogarth drawing \u2013 makes a distinguished, lugubrious Mistress Quickly. The most inflected performance comes from Oliver Ford Davies as Justice Shallow. True, it's not so hard to make Shallow deep: he has some of the most resonant lines in the play. Yet Davies gives precise comic life to his tremulous, rose-tinted memories, his leg juddering with excitement as he looks back 60 years. There are some unusual decisions. Trevor White plays Hotspur, intelligently but unalluringly, as if his fieriness were a symptom of emotional arrest. He's like an eight-year-old with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, always running, jumping, his limbs wagging while his face is fixed in eagerness: he skips to war. As Hotspur's wife, a character of few lines but considerable piquancy, Jennifer Kirby is stricken with overactive arms, delivering each phrase with a new gesture. One of the most appealing of Shakespearean couples are robbed of charm, if not of conviction.
