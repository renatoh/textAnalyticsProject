I can\u2019t look at him,\u201d said Avilez, a 27-year-old undocumented student. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve fought for, all the victories we\u2019ve had, in one day are basically taken away.\u201d Avilez gathered with other immigrant student activists at the University of California, Berkeley, on Friday to prepare for a morning of \u201cteach-ins\u201d aimed at organizing against Trump and his \u201charmful\u201d agenda. Crowded inside a diversity office at the school of public health, the students, including some who are undocumented and have relied on the protections of Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) policy, were near tears after Trump\u2019s speech ended. \u201cI felt like he wasn\u2019t talking me, he wasn\u2019t talking about my family, he wasn\u2019t talking about my community,\u201d said Johanna Figueroa, 25. \u201cWho are you talking to? Who are you representing?\u201d At Trump Cafe in Bellville, Texas, a self-described American-born Hispanic woman took a different view of Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric. \u201cI feel for all [immigrants], but there\u2019s a right way and a wrong way and that\u2019s what I feel he\u2019s trying to make Americans understand,\u201d said Linda Myers, 66, a small-business owner. Myers, wearing a stars and stripes flag as a scarf, said Trump\u2019s speech was \u201cvery, very moving. If it doesn\u2019t bring our country together, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that can be done. It was moving, it hit where it needed to hit.\u201d Myers sat with other patrons who piled in to eat lunch, watch the inauguration on television and buy Trump-themed merchandise at the establishment owned by Muslim immigrants. Tables in the function room were laid out ready for two large parties of celebrating Trump supporters. The owners, from Jerusalem, emigrated separately to the US and met in Chicago. About two weeks before the presidential election in November, they renamed their small-town Texas cafe in honor of Donald Trump. After the change, Eddie Hawa, 46, said he had some critical, even threatening, phone calls from people from outside Texas \u2013 but the locals in this county of fewer than 30,000 people, an hour\u2019s drive west of Houston, were overwhelmingly supportive. Trump won here with 79% of the vote. \u201cHe\u2019s a businessman and we need businessmen,\u201d said Su Hawa, 28. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart man, he\u2019s very smart. I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s right now our president, I\u2019m so excited.\u201d But as Muslims, are they not worried by talk that Trump may institute a registry or travel ban? \u201cHe was talking in general, not individual people. I think what he\u2019s saying, any president would say it \u2013 anybody who comes to the United States, you have to go through the system to become a citizen or resident,\u201d Eddie Hawa said. \u201cHe was talking about Isis, he wasn\u2019t talking about people living here.\u201d Many opponents made it a point to boycott watching the inauguration altogether, whether because they were outside protesting or just watching another channel, hoping to drive down Trump\u2019s television ratings. \u201cI for one am actively not watching it. And what I mean by actively not watching it, I\u2019m going to be turning on something else,\u201d said Floyd Rumohr, who heads of the Brooklyn Community Pride Center in New York. Janson Wu, the executive director of GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders (Glad), was at the Creating Change Conference in Philadelphia during the inauguration ceremony. The conference is held at a hotel, and Wu said the inauguration was nearly impossible to avoid on the televisions there, but he was choosing not to watch. \u201cBeing among such a diverse group of activists and advocates reminds me of why we do this work and gives me energy to go forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anywhere else I\u2019d rather be on inauguration day.\u201d In Atlanta, Georgia, protestors said they would rely on news reports to learn about what Trump said, but would stop short of watching the man talk. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t watch it,\u201d said Patricia Cofie, unemployed. \u201cI\u2019ll watch the news. That\u2019s about as much as I can take.\u201d In Berkeley, Sofia Villagomez, 23, said it was a struggle to force herself to even watch the event. \u201cGod help us all,\u201d said the public health student, part of a group called Borders and Bodies Collective. \u201cI\u2019m just feeling like I need to be informed about what\u2019s going as much as what\u2019s happening just pains me. We\u2019re headed for a fight, for sure.\u201d Gladis Chavez, a 26-year-old undocumented student, said the reports that Trump may immediately repeal Daca, which could put students like her at risk of deportation, were heavily weighing on her. \u201cIt really scares me. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do if I lose everything I\u2019ve been working for.\u201d. Since the election, activists at the University of California\u2019s progressive Berkeley campus \u2013 famous for its 1960s civil rights protests known as the free speech movement \u2013 have pressured the university to be a \u201csanctuary\u201d for undocumented people. \u201cOur lives were just used for political gain,\u201d said Chavez, who was born in Mexico and came to the US aged two. \u201cOur lives are just not valued. We\u2019re all under attack. I feel like I\u2019ve done everything I can do to show I belong here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
