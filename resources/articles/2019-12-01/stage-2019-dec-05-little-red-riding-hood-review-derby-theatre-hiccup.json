It\u2019s this element of surprise that makes their productions so much fun \u2013 and not just for the kids. This year, Hiccup and co-producer Derby theatre are taking us into the deepest, darkest depths of the Big Bad Wolf\u2019s belly, where Grandma lies after being swallowed whole. But this madcap show is such a winner that, as the end approaches, I can\u2019t help hoping Grandma stays down there a little longer. The same creative team behind last year\u2019s Goldilocks and the Three Bears have reunited, and they bounce off each other with ease and skill. Sarah Brigham\u2019s script is full of clever twists (is that Little Red Riding Hood climbing inside the Wolf\u2019s mouth?) and witty dialogue, with some particularly great gags for Bethan Morgan\u2019s channel-swimming, circus-joining Grandma. Ivan Stott\u2019s songs have a glowing energy to them, his lyrics are as sharp as ever, and dramaturg Sarah Argent makes sure the storytelling is crystal clear. There\u2019s a slapdash charm to the small ensemble of actors, who function as storytellers, puppeteers, musicians, comics and anything else you might fancy. Half the time they look as though they\u2019re making things up on the spot \u2013 and just happen to be very, very good. Sam Wilde\u2019s set initially looks a bit cobbled together but, like Red Riding Hood herself, is much cleverer than first appears. There are countless visuals to savour but the image that will stay with me is a puppet-sized Grandma trapped in the Wolf\u2019s stomach (a wardrobe swung wide open), swinging from some tonsils fashioned out of a red bra. At Derby theatre until 4 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
