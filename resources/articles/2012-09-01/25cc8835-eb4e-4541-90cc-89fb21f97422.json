Provisional figures from last year's census circulating among East London's town halls strongly suggest that the six Olympic host boroughs - Hackney, Greenwich, Waltham Forest, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Barking and Dagenham - had a lot more people living in them than had been estimated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which also conducted the census, only as recently as the middle of 2010. In the case of Barking and Dagenham the difference is relatively small - 3.3%, or 6,159 people - but in the others it is substantial, especially Newham's. The ONS estimate of Newham's population in the middle of 2010 was 240,124. But its measurement on census night - 27 March 2011 - produced a figure of 308,000, higher by a rather startling 22%. The comparison figures for the other four host boroughs are: Tower Hamlets higher by 16,204 people, or 6.4%; Greenwich higher by 26,091, or 10.2%; Hackney higher by 27,072 or 11%; Waltham Forest higher by 31,055, or 12%. In total, the six host boroughs were found to contain nearly 175,000 more people than has been estimated less than a year earlier. What's going on? I've yet to call the ONS to find out what they think the figures mean - it's top of my list - but they are already being seized on to the reinforce complaints among East End local authorities that they haven't been receiving the levels of grant support from central government for health, policing and everything else that their population sizes merit. It has not gone unnoticed that the same data analysis shows that leafy Richmond, Kingston, Sutton and Bromley, mostly affluent Kensington and Chelsea and, by comfortably the largest margin of 15.4%, Westminster, appear to have fewer people than had been thought. It's not all about possible under-measuring in the East - Brent's census figure, for example, is 17.6% higher than its mid-2010 estimate, while Lambeth's and Hounslow's are both over 6% higher - but that won't stop the Games boroughs' administrations pointing out that if a glorious social and economic legacy is to materialise, a larger slice of the taxpayer cake would not only be helpful but also numerically justified."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
