Forget it, Ed", "bodyText": "\u2712At the risk of offending at least half of Guardian readers, I do think Ed Miliband has been a bit of a wuss about taking all his paternity leave. Obviously it's meant as a gesture \u2013 if he didn't take it, other employers might try to ignore it. But if he were the CEO of a big company, nothing \u2013 not even the need to mix formula and do his cuddling duty \u2013 would keep him from at least looking in for crucial meetings, in this case prime minister's questions. He could have slotted that, with preparation, into a couple of hours and been home to change many nappies. As David Cameron said, during a thinly-coded attack on Boris Johnson at the Spectator/Threadneedle parliamentarian awards this week, \"shit happens\". This is not a line that you might have heard from, say, Anthony Eden, though he might have had a lot more cause to say it. \u2712The awards were huge fun. Alan Johnson said that the patter of tiny feet could be heard again in Downing Street \u2013 \"but that's what happens when you make [the famously small] Sarah Teather a minister\". I sat next to an MP who told me the sad story of Wayne David, who is the Labour member for Caerphilly. This town had been named the \"dogging\" capital of Britain. The local paper rang to ask him his thoughts. He was all in favour. \"There are family dogs, companion dogs, working dogs \u2013 it's just what we want in Caerphilly!\" The paper had to explain the demotic to him, and he was crushed. \u2712They even had dancing after the event, though by then the prime minister had left. Otherwise he might have joined us, if only to get away from dirty nappies. I bopped with my colleagues Polly Curtis and Allegra Stratton, who thoughtfully placed their handbags on the floor for us to dance around. My opposite number on the Times, Ann Treneman, jived with her beautiful daughter Vanessa. And our own Julian Glover dragged his civil partner Matthew Parris on to the floor, where they jitterbugged, like American teenagers in the 50s. Only in suits and black tie. It must have made a bizarre sight, but a refreshing change \u2013 the press making idiots of themselves in front of the politicians. \u2712There is no privacy left in our electronic world. Fleeing the bash in time to catch the last train home, I blagged my way into a taxi with Rod Liddle of the Spectator and the ineffable Nadine Dorries MP. Moments later, I am told, she was tweeting about her \"interesting ride\" with \"Rod Liddle (funny) and Simon Hoggart (nice).\" It has come to something that you can't even be courteous to Nadine Dorries in the closed space of a London cab without the whole world knowing your shame. \u2712While we are on Tory women, may I say how much I hope Ann Widdecombe succeeds on Strictly Come Dancing again this weekend. I have limitless admiration for that lady, a woman who probably never said in her life a single thing she didn't mean. Her plea for shorter prison terms at a Tory conference was magnificent and bold. Her speech against foxhunting was brave and funny. (\"Some people say the fox enjoys the hunt. I should like to drop them near a herd of hungry lions in the Masai Mara and see how much they enjoy the hunt.\") She does a remarkable amount of unrecorded charity work. She has had men friends in the past \u2013 not that you have heard of them \u2013 but that only adds to her allure. We are always moaning on about how we want our politicians to be open, candid and not care what anyone thinks. Now we have got one, and thank goodness we are cherishing her. \u2712More daft labelling: Elsie McCutcheon emails the label from a pack of Waitrose Christmas gift wrap and tags, \"suitable for those avoiding nuts\". She asks: \"Do I brandish it when answering the door to unwanted religious callers?\" Jim Lindsay sent in the leaflet from a packet of quinine tablets from Actavis: \"Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following side effects \u2026 confusion, loss of consciousness, coma, death.\" \u2712I'm delighted to report a pleasing uptick of interest in the great GK Chesterton, a writer half forgotten now apart from his Father Brown stories. Everyman's Library is publishing a selection of his work shortly, and the indefatigable Bevis Hillier has just produced The Wit and Wisdom of GK Chesterton (Continuum Books) which is, as you would imagine, both wise and witty. It all sent me to re-read his wonderful set of short stories, The Club of Queer Trades: the man who arranges artificial adventures to spice up dull lives, the treehouse agent \u2013 lovely, warm, funny tales, and marked with Chesterton's extraordinary ability to paint a dull suburban street with as much life and light as a majestic sun-covered landscape. \u2712A number of people have written in to tell tales about what a kind and generous man Gordon Ramsay really is. I am slightly anxious about reprinting these because he could sue me for helping to destroy his well-burnished image. But Caroline Coombes, who worked for a market research company, recalls how Ramsay catered a client lunch at the offices, and on hearing they got to eat the leftovers, sent a tray of delicious food in to the phone interviewers, marked specially for them. Francis Whitebloom, a British filmmaker working in LA, sometimes turns out for an expat soccer team, which frequently includes visiting British stars, some of whom are, apparently, well up themselves. Not Ramsay. The best player on the pitch, he always has help, advice and encouragement for all the players and is, in Francis's words, \"a joy to play with\". I hope Ramsay's lawyers will back off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
