Fulham travel to Liverpool on Sunday, having lost their past five Premier League games, the most recent being Monday\u2019s 1-0 reverse at relegation rivals Huddersfield. It is a woeful run underpinned by consistently poor defending and has put Jokanovic under mounting pressure less than six months after he led Fulham to promotion via the play-offs. The club\u2019s former captain and current first-team coach, Scott Parker, has been linked with the manager\u2019s job should Jokanovic, as has been reported, be sacked during the international break that follows Fulham\u2019s trip to Anfield. The Serb dismissed such talk as \u201cgossip\u201d on Friday before going on the offensive. \u201cAfter the Huddersfield game, I told them [the players]: \u2018Listen, I am a fantastic coach. I did a fantastic job with my staff and the analysts because everything we expected, we found it during the game,\u2019\u201d said Jokanovic. \u201cBut we did not stay with any ball, we did not run the space, we were not available for second phase. So the message is clear: we must make effort to fight for the result. We must show the spirit, we must push all together. This is the way to be positive and find the solution. \u201cMy job is to organise the team, it\u2019s not screaming at people to make them run and sprint and attack the space. I know they feel a little hurt after my words but they must be adult people and take responsibility. We cannot sell our skin so cheap.\u201d Fulham go to Anfield without Kevin McDonald and Joe Bryan, both of whom have hamstring injuries, and with the worst defensive record in the Premier League having conceded 29 goals in 11 games. That is hardly ideal for what is sure to be a testing afternoon against players such as Mohamed Salah, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Roberto Firmino. But Jokanovic, having seen Liverpool lose to Red Star Belgrade in midweek, insists Fulham can also overcome them and secure Fulham\u2019s first victory at Anfield since May 2012. The 50-year-old also delivered a somewhat pointed message to the club\u2019s hierarchy, led by the owner Shahid Khan, should they be considering dismissing him. \u201cI am working many years with this team, the board of the club know how I am working and they know I never surrender and that I am never scared about speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not happy about going to any place, any stadium and being a victim and not having an opportunity to win the game. To the players I say: \u2018Give me an opportunity to win by being brave and pushing hard, and independent of the result you will make me proud and make yourself and your family proud.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
