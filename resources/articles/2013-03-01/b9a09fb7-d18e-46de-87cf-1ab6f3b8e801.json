After two tries apiece in the first half everything seemed to be going Bath's way when Dawidiuk tip-tackled Dave Attwood and the referee, Tim Wigglesworth, had no choice but to wave a red card. Left to play the last 30 minutes with 14 men Gloucester went 13 points behind when fast thinking from Peter Stringer and fast hands from Nick Abendanon put Tom Biggs over in the corner. However, Rob Cook put Jonny May in for his second try of the night and suddenly the match was up for grabs again, especially when Cook squeezed over his touchline conversion. Bath, though, held on. Gloucester once went decades without a league win at the Rec but on Friday night they were looking for their third consecutive double. They also had Freddie Burns back after missing five matches \u2013 and the chance of making his mark with the England Six Nations squad. Against that Bath had their two Test props, Davy Wilson of England and Paul James of Wales, back and a pack that has been getting up a decent head of steam, although the initial threat came from Kyle Eastmond, the centre winning the penalty which Tom Heathcote converted to open the scoring. If that got the Bath fans going they soon had a 10-0 lead to shout about. Matt Banahan, unwanted by England, started the ball rolling \u2013 literally \u2013 with a perfect chip ahead. Abendanon seemed odds-on favourite to touch down until he was hit from behind by yet another England man, Charlie Sharples, and Wigglesworth went to the TMO before awarding a penalty try and a yellow card. However, 10 minutes later it was the travelling Gloucester fans making the noise as Abendanon went from hero to zero and Gloucester came close to scoring twice in two minutes. First the full-back's kick was charged down by Henry Trinder, the centre running in the ricochet before Burns and May zipped down the left, only for the inside pass to Mike Tindall to be ruled forward by the TMO. Nevertheless the lead had been cut by half and 10 minutes before half-time the TMO was in action again as Gloucester pulled level. Again Burns and Trinder got things going but this time it was May who got over the line with Geoff Warren ruling there had been no obstruction. Even with a Gloucester conversion and a Bath penalty, that was not the end of a remarkable first half as Heathcote, on Scotland's radar, carved Gloucester's midfield open and added the conversion once he had put the try on a plate for Eastmond. All that remained was for Rob Cook \u2013 replacing Burns, who hobbled off with cramp after one success from five kicks \u2013 to bounce a penalty in off the crossbar to make 35 points in the first 40 minutes.
