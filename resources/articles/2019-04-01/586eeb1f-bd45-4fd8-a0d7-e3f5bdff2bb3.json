The supporters will certainly cherish Son Heung-min\u2019s contribution if it is the platform for Spurs to eliminate the Premier League champions when the sides renew acquaintances in Manchester next Wednesday. Son\u2019s goal dramatically changed the complexion of this two-leg tie, but that told only part of the story from a game that also featured a moment of redemption for Hugo Lloris. The Spurs goalkeeper has been under intense scrutiny since his erratic performance in the defeat at Liverpool 10 days ago but his penalty save from Sergio Ag\u00fcero, 12 minutes in, was a reminder of his qualities. More importantly for Spurs, it spared his team the possibility of their night quickly turning into an ordeal. These were moments Spurs will hold precious even if their victory was tempered by the grievous setback of losing Harry Kane to his latest ankle injury. Kane needed six weeks to get over the last one and as he hobbled down the tunnel there was a celebratory cheer from the corner housing Manchester City supporters. They, like the home fans, knew the potential importance of the England captain having no more involvement. It just turned out to be a mistake for anyone to believe that Spurs without Kane were a flower without water. Instead, Son struck the winner in the 78th minute, cutting inside Fabian Delph before letting fly with his left foot and getting lucky when Ederson, City\u2019s goalkeeper, let the ball go beneath his body. Nobody should think City are incapable of saving themselves but, to put it into context, if Spurs can get one goal in the second leg, their opponents will need three. No wonder the Spurs fans gave the impression after the final whistle they did not really want to leave. Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, is left to ruminate on a strangely disjointed performance from his team and perhaps one of the few occasions when he may have come up short. His team selection was certainly perplexing, featuring a new-look 4\u20112\u20113\u20111 system with David Silva in a more advanced role and, most intriguingly, Delph doubling up as a left-back and holding midfielder, flitting between the positions depending on the whereabouts of the ball. City were missing the injured Bernardo Silva, but who would have imagined Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan would be selected ahead of Leroy San\u00e9 and Kevin De Bruyne? Guardiola gets more of these decisions right than wrong but this was not an occasion, ultimately, to disprove the theory that City are a better team when De Bruyne plays. Perhaps it would have worked out very differently if Ag\u00fcero had scored from the VAR-assisted penalty that threatened to shroud the night in controversy. Instead, it was difficult to understand why a routinely successful side would experiment with a new formation and tactics for such a key assignment. City have, after all, beaten everyone in the Premier League by playing the way they know best. They also came up against a side who were quick to the ball, strong in the tackle and determined to unsettle their opponents. Kane, in particular, chased down everything during his time on the pitch. He took several whacks for his troubles, particularly when Fernandinho clattered him with an elbow then repeated the trick while they were on the floor. Kane\u2019s final act was a robust tackle on Delph directly in front of the Spurs dugout. Delph\u2019s reaction was to give his England teammate a mouthful for what he thought was a dangerous challenge. Kane, however, had no interest in prolonging the argument. Delph\u2019s studs had landed on Kane\u2019s left ankle and as soon as the striker rose to his feet, he never looked back at the pitch again, making his way down the tunnel with the aid of one of the club\u2019s medics. For a 15-minute period after his departure it seemed as though City were gradually getting on top. What they could never find was the decisive pass and, by their usual standards, that was unusual even if the speed of the game was tremendous. So quick, indeed, that very few people seemed to notice Raheem Sterling\u2019s shot had ricocheted off Danny Rose\u2019s elbow in the first half that led to the Dutch referee, Bj\u00f6rn Kuipers, making that now-familiar rectangle motion with his fingers to signal the decision had gone to VAR. In fairness to the officials, the penalty decision was a justifiable one. To describe it as a shock, however, would be an understatement. City\u2019s players were getting into position for a corner when the news flashed up on the large screens. Not even Sterling had appealed for a penalty and suddenly the referee was running back from the VAR monitor to point to the penalty spot, with the vast majority of the crowd having no idea what it was for. Ag\u00fcero\u2019s penalty was aimed to the left of Lloris but the shot lacked power and precision and Guardiola, who chose not to watch, would have known from the noise of the crowd that the opportunity had been missed. Ag\u00fcero, who found it difficult on his return from injury, was substituted during the second half. De Bruyne and San\u00e9 were brought on later and City were also given six minutes of stoppages time to conjure up an equaliser. It was beyond them and Spurs finished with the clean sheet that could be so vital in the return leg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
