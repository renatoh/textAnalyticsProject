Here\u2019s a glance at today\u2019s major news items: Trump claims Anthony Fauci \u2018wrong\u2019 about cause of Covid-19 surge. The US president launched an extraordinary attack on his own top infectious disease expert, arguing against the doctor\u2019s claim that high rates of infection in the US stem from a less aggressive reaction to the virus in terms of economic shutdowns and stay-at-home orders. Florida closes beaches as Hurricane Isaias barrels through Bahamas. Hurricane Isaias ripped shingles off roofs and blew over trees as it carved its way through the Bahamas early on Saturday and headed toward the Florida coast, where officials in Miami said they were closing beaches, marinas and parks. Democratic congressman issues blistering attack on Republicans after Covid-19 diagnosis. Arizona Democrat Ra\u00fal Grijalva, who revealed Saturday he tested positive for the coronavirus, has condemned Republican politicians for their carelessness around Congress and blamed them for spreading the virus. Trump heads to his own golf club as Covid-19 surges and jobless benefits expire. The US president prompted a familiar barrage of criticism on Saturday by visiting one of his own golf clubs as the country remains caught in numerous intensifying crises from the raging coronavirus epidemic to anti-racism protests to the failure to extend benefits to tens of millions of jobless Americans. UK lobbies US to support controversial new nuclear warheads. The UK has been lobbying Congress in support of a controversial new warhead for Trident missiles, claiming it is critical for \u201cthe future of Nato as a nuclear alliance\u201d. Portland: 1,000 peacefully protest amid withdrawal of federal agents. More than a thousand people showed up in downtown Portland early on Saturday to peacefully protest, about three days after the announcement that the presence of US agents there would be reduced. Texas \u2018wide open for business\u2019 despite surge in Covid-19 cases. Four months into the pandemic a mandatory mask order is finally in place in the Lone Star state, but some express concern that it\u2019s too little, too late. Trump impeachment witness says nation\u2019s values under threat. Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the 21-year US army veteran who reported concerns about Trump\u2019s 2019 phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to fellow members of the National Security Council, has written an op-ed in the Washington Post condemning the US president. The coronavirus forced baseball\u2019s 17th postponement in 10 days on Saturday, prompting at least two more players to opt out of the season entirely and casting doubt on whether the league can complete a truncated 2020 season. A game between the Cardinals and Brewers in Milwaukee was postponed for the second straight day after one more player and three staff members with St Louis tested positive for the coronavirus. Friday\u2019s series opener between the midwestern rivals had been scuttled only hours before the first pitch due to two Cardinals players testing positive. Major League Baseball said Thursday it was updating its coronavirus safety measures after a 17th player on the Miami Marlins tested positive for Covid-19, a mere seven days after all 30 clubs opened a shortened, delayed season in empty stadiums. The Marlins outbreak, which first came to light on Monday after the team played a three-game series on the road against the Philadelphia Phillies, prompted MLB to postpone all of the team\u2019s games through at least Sunday amid doubts the team will be able to reopen its season as planned Tuesday at home. Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has reportedly ordered all teams to use surgical masks instead of cloth ones, encouraged players not to leave hotels in road cities except for games and mandated every club to travel with a virus protocol compliance officer to ensure rules are followed. According to an ESPN report, Manfred has warned players union\u2019 executive director Tony Clark that baseball could shut down for the season if it doesn\u2019t do a better job of managing the spread. Dr Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the US\u2019s top infectious disease expert, expressed concern over the outbreak when asked about it during an appearance on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America on Tuesday morning. \u201cThis could put [the season] in danger,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they need to stop, but we just need to follow this and see what happens with other teams on a day-by-day basis.\u201d The pandemic had already forced MLB to delay and truncate the familiar 162-game, six-month season to a 60-game, 67-day sprint with a number of rule changes designed to speed up the game and protect the players and umpires. On Saturday, Miami second baseman Isan Diaz and two-time All-Star center fielder Lorenzo Cain of the Brewers became the latest of the more than a dozen major leaguers to opt out of the season entirely, citing the health risks stemming from Covid-19. Others who are playing, like Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle, have expressed ambivalence over baseball\u2019s return as case numbers continue to surge throughout the country. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring baseball back during a pandemic that\u2019s killed 130,000 people,\u201d Doolittle said on 5 July. \u201cWe\u2019re way worse off as a country than we were in March when we shut this thing down. And, like, look where the other developed countries are in their response to this. We haven\u2019t done any of the things that other countries have done to bring sports back. \u201cSports are like the reward of a functioning society. And we\u2019re trying to just bring it back, even though we\u2019ve taken none of the steps to flatten the curve.\u201d At least 14 members of the House of Representatives and Senate \u2013 seven Republicans and seven Democrats \u2013 have tested positive or are presumed to have had Covid-19 since the start of the coronavirus pandemic after Arizona\u2019s Ra\u00fal Grijalva and Texas\u2019s Louie Gohmert became the latest this week, Reuters reports. Representative Morgan Griffith, 62, a Virginia Republican and member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said in mid-July that he had tested positive. His office said he did not have significant symptoms. The South Carolina Republican representative Tom Rice, 62, said on Facebook in mid-June that he, his wife and his son had all tested positive for the coronavirus but that all were \u201con the mend\u201d. The Utah Democratic representative Ben McAdams caught the virus in March, was hospitalized and needed oxygen. After his release, he warned others to take the virus seriously. \u201cI\u2019m young, I\u2019m 45 years old, I\u2019m healthy, I exercise every day and it hit me really hard,\u201d he told ABC. Other affected lawmakers include Nydia Velazquez, 67, a Democrat from New York, the Massachusetts Democrat Seth Moulton, 41, the Republican Florida representative Mario D\u00edaz-Balart, 58, and the Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul, 57, who had said on 22 March that he had tested positive and was in quarantine. Arizona congressman Ra\u00fal Grijalva, who said Saturday he tested positive for the coronavirus, has condemned Republican politicians for their carelessness around Congress and blamed them for spreading the virus. The Democratic representative issued the fiery condemnation from self-quarantine at his residence in the Washington area. \u201cWhile I cannot blame anyone directly for this, this week has shown that there are some members of Congress who fail to take this crisis seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cNumerous Republican members routinely strut around the Capitol without a mask to selfishly make a political statement at the expense of their colleagues, staff, and their families.\u201d The attack comes after Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican who has frequently refused to wear a mask, tested positive for coronavirus last week. In shunning a mask, Gohmert is following the lead of Donald Trump, who is rarely seen wearing one either in the White House or on presidential visits. Grijalva had presided over a hearing of the House Natural Resources Committee which Gohmert attended on Tuesday. In a TV interview after the diagnosis, Gohmert even suggested he may have contracted coronavirus by incorrectly wearing his mask. \u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder if by keeping a mask on and keeping it in place, that if I might have put some germs or some of the virus on to the mask and breathed it in,\u201d Gohmert said. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Saturday the coronavirus pandemic was likely to be \u201clengthy\u201d after its emergency committee met to evaluate the crisis six months after sounding the international alarm. The committee \u201chighlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 pandemic\u201d, the WHO said in a statement, and warned of the risk of \u201cresponse fatigue\u201d given the socio-economic pressures on countries. The panel gathered on Friday for the fourth time since the coronavirus crisis began, half a year on from its 30 January declaration of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) \u2013 the WHO\u2019s highest level of alarm. \u201cWHO continues to assess the global risk level of Covid-19 to be very high,\u201d said its latest statement. \u201cThe committee highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 pandemic, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts.\u201d The coronavirus has killed at least 680,000 people and infected at least 17.6 million since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. Mexico also overtook Britain to became the third hardest hit country for virus deaths after Brazil and the US with over 46,600 fatal cases. Going into the meeting, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the pandemic\u2019s effects would be long-lasting. \u201cIt\u2019s sobering to think that six months ago, when you recommended I declare a PHEIC, there were less than 100 cases and no deaths outside China,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cThe pandemic is a once-in-a-century health crisis, the effects of which will be felt for decades to come.\u201d Donald Trump has again publicly contradicted Dr Anthony Fauci, claiming the US\u2019s top infectious disease expert is \u201cwrong\u201d to attribute the surge in US coronavirus cases to the country\u2019s failure to sufficiently shut down its economy. The US president came in hot on Saturday after a lengthy-for-him 15-hour hiatus from Twitter, responding to a clip of Fauci\u2019s testimony before Congress from Friday with the largely debunked claim that Covid-19 cases in the US are surging exclusively due to increased testing. \u201cWrong!\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. If we tested less, there would be less cases. How did Italy, France &amp; Spain do? Now Europe sadly has flare ups. Most of our governors worked hard &amp; smart. We will come back STRONG!\u201d Fauci, a key member of the White House coronavirus task force, had made the claim before the House\u2019s special select committee investigating the Trump administration\u2019s response to the pandemic. \u201cWhen they shut down, they shut down to the tune of about 95%, getting their baseline down to tens or hundreds of cases a day,\u201d he told the House panel, adding that only about 50% of the United States shut down against a much higher baseline of daily cases. The idea that case numbers are high only because diagnostic testing has expended has been continually shot down by Trump\u2019s own top public health officials, as the increase has also revealed the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is climbing across nearly the entire country. \u201cA high rate of positive tests indicates a government is only testing the sickest patients who seek out medical attention and is not casting a wide enough net,\u201d according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, a primary source of updated information on the pandemic. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is removing its top intelligence official from his post after it was revealed the office has been surveilling the work of American journalists reporting on the unrest in Portland, circulating \u201cintelligence reports\u201d on them to other federal agencies in a move that has been decried as a clear violation of the constitutional right to a free press. Brian Murphy, who has been the acting chief of a unit known as the \u201coffice of intelligence and analysis\u201d, is being removed from that role at the behest of acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf, Politco reported on Saturday. The department has faced criticism since the Washington Post revealed on Thursday that the intelligence reports, which referred specifically to two prominent US journalists whose reporting had revealed the disarray within the Trump administration\u2019s contentious deployment of federal agents to Portland, were distributed in the past week to law enforcement and other agencies. One of the journalists, Mike Baker of the New York Times, had disclosed a leaked DHS memo that discussed the confusion prevalent among the federal agents sent to Portland. The memo showed that the camouflaged officers had little understanding of the nature of the demonstrations they were being asked to police. As our Washington bureau chief David Smith has written, members of the media have become targets for both police and protesters in cities across the country amid this summer\u2019s national uprising. Donald Trump departed his golf club in Virginia at 1.57pm, according to the White House press pool. Demonstrators gathered outside the Loudoun county property in what\u2019s become a regular occurrence as the president\u2019s twice-weekly visits have continued over the past several months. A much larger crowd was assembled as the motorcade departed en route to the White House compared to when the US president arrived. A number of Trump supporters holding \u201cTrump-Pence\u201d placards stood one side of the street, while protesters with \u201cBiden for President\u201d signs gathered on the opposite side. Nearer to the protesters\u2019 side, \u201cTRUMP KILLED HERMAN CAIN\u201d was written on the ground in chalk. CNN, which tallies Trump trips to his golf clubs, reported that the visit was Trump\u2019s 283th trip to a golf course while in office and his 376th day at a Trump property. The motorcade arrived back at the White House at 2.36pm. The president has no public events scheduled for the rest of the day (or Sunday). More than a thousand people showed up in downtown Portland early Saturday to peacefully protest in the wake of an announcement that the presence of federal agents in Oregon\u2019s largest city would be reduced. The Associated Press reports: Friday\u2019s overnight protest mimicked that of Thursday, which was the first time in weeks that demonstrations ended without any major confrontations, violence or arrests. The change in tone outside a federal courthouse that\u2019s become ground zero in clashes between demonstrators and federal agents came after the US government began drawing down its forces in the liberal city under a deal between Democratic governor Kate Brown and the Trump administration. As of midnight on Saturday, no federal agents had emerged from the courthouse, which has been the center of protests for weeks, and there was no noticeable law enforcement presence surrounding the area. The fence that has separated protesters and U.S. agents stationed at the courthouse was decorated with balloons and upside down American flags sewn together with \u201cBLM\u201d painted across, an apparent reference to the Black Lives Matter movement. At one point in the night a small firework was shot over the fence. As it sizzled out on its own, protesters pleaded with others to remain peaceful. Later, a few small fires were occasionally started outside the courthouse, with at least one put out by other protesters. Unlike previous weeks, protesters were not centered mainly outside the courthouse, but scattered throughout downtown. Trump, who has largely hitched his political fate to his image as the \u201claw and order president\u201d, downplayed the withdrawal in a tweet on Friday night, insisting the Department of Homeland Security \u201cis not leaving Portland until local police complete cleanup of Anarchists and Agitators!\u201d Protests have roiled Portland for more than two months following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Florida reported more than 9,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, and hospitals in the state are making preparations as Hurricane Isaias beats down on the US coast. Cape Canaveral Hospital, which is located on a barrier island, said it had made plans before the storm hits and had moved its Covid-19 patients to other facilities before the storm hits. \u201c[S]hould there have been an evacuation, we wanted to make sure we took every necessary precaution,\u201d a statement from the hospital said. \u201cAs we have prepared for the storm, we have contingency plans in place to care for all of our patients during this public health crisis, keeping them as safe as possible from not only the virus but the storm.\u201d Meanwhile, the storm is passing over the Bahamas and the winds are picking up: Our senior political reporter Daniel Strauss has news on why a Silicon Valley billionaire trying to get an immigration hawk elected to the US Senate: In usually deep-red Kansas, Democrats have the luxury of a sleepy primary contest for US Senate. Republicans do not. That\u2019s because in the Democratic primary the Kansas state senator Barbara Bollier is the heavy favorite to win her party\u2019s nomination and then run a competitive general election campaign fueled by a large war chest of cash. That prospect is sharpened because Republicans are having to go through a bloody primary between the Kansas congressman Roger Marshall and former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, the immigration hardliner and former Republican nominee for governor whose unpopularity \u2013 should he win the nod \u2013 could hand the Democrats a vital Senate seat they would never normally hope to win. Kobach\u2019s candidacy is notable for its support from the billionaire Peter Thiel, the libertarian venture capitalist who has at times expressed the same type of hardline immigration stances as Kobach. You can read the full story below: There have been fears that large outdoor gatherings will spark a resurgence of Covid-19 in New York City, where thousands of people died during the early stages of the pandemic. On Saturday, Andrew Cuomo said 34 establishments in the city were given Covid-19 related violations on Friday night, and seven had their liquor licenses revoked. \u201cWe need the NYPD to step up and do enforcement,\u201d Cuomo said. There were four reported deaths from Covid-19 in New York state on Friday. More than 82,000 tests were conducted and 753 of those came back positive for the virus. Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the 21-year US army veteran who reported concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s 2019 phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to fellow members of the National Security Council, has written an op-ed in the Washington Post condemning Donald Trump. Vindman went on to become a key figure in the president\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Vindman, whose family fled from the Soviet Union when he was a child said he was alarmed by Trump\u2019s rise and tactics. He described Trump\u2019s administration as \u201creminiscent of the authoritarian regime my family fled,\u201d adding that: \u201cAt no point in my career or life have I felt our nation\u2019s values under greater threat and in more peril than at this moment.\u201d He did however, say that he still has faith in American institutions: \u201cDuring my testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, I reassured my father, who experienced Soviet authoritarianism firsthand, saying, \u2018Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\u2019 Despite Trump\u2019s retaliation, I stand by that conviction,\u201d he wrote. Vindman is retiring from the army and said he would now spend his time looking to \u201cissue a mandate to reject hate and bigotry and a return to the ideals that set the United States apart from the rest of the world.\u201d \u2022 This entry was amended on 2 August 2020 because Vindman\u2019s family fled from the Soviet Union, not to the Soviet Union as an earlier version said. Donald Trump has approved a declaration of emergency in Florida as Hurricane Isaias approaches. Officials in Miami have already closed beaches, marinas and parks in the city to prepare for the storm, which has emerged from the Bahamas. \u201cThe President\u2019s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population,\u201d the White House said in a press release. Florida\u2019s Division of Emergency Management is also sending 10,000 items of personal protective equipment to shelters as the potential for people crowding together as the storm peaks grows. Miami hospitals, already stretched by the Covid-19 pandemic, say they have four days of emergency power should the grid go down. ESPN reported on Friday night that Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred fears the season may be in jeopardy if baseball and, by extension, Manfred himself, does not do a better job of containing Covid-19. A host of games have been wiped out in a season that has already been shortened and intensified by the pandemic. An outbreak in the Miami Marlins camp led to the postponement of their games as well as ones involving the Yankees, Phillies and Nationals. With few spare dates in the shortened calendar to make up the missed games, the future does not look bright. Now news is emerging of an outbreak among the St Louis Cardinals. Their game against the Brewers was called off on Friday night after a number of positive tests, and ESPN reports Saturday\u2019s game has been postponed after four more positive tests in the team. MLB has chosen not to play its season in an \u201cisolated bubble\u201d as other leagues, such as MLS and the NBA have done. Those leagues are playing at Disney World in Florida, meaning teams do not have to travel as much as their counterparts in baseball do. Amid all the noise of an election involving Donald Trump \u2013 all the inflammatory tweets and shadowy Facebook posts \u2013 one set of ads has somehow managed to break through. There\u2019s the one of the US president shuffling down a ramp that declares that the president \u201cis not well\u201d. There\u2019s the whispering one about Trump\u2019s \u201cloyalty problem\u201d inside his White House, campaign and family. There\u2019s the epic Mourning in America that remakes Reagan\u2019s election-defining 1984 ad, turning the sun-bathed suburbs into a dark national portrait of pandemic and recession. On Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, those three ads alone have racked up more than 35m views. The Lincoln Project, run by a group of renegade Republican political consultants, has crystallized one of the core narratives of the 2020 campaign in ways that few other political commercials have in past cycles. Its work on brutal attack ads sits alongside the swift boat veterans against John Kerry in 2004, the Willie Horton ad against Michael Dukakis in 1988, and the daisy ad against Barry Goldwater in 1964. Their reward? Disdain from independent media, distrust across the political spectrum and a recent series of harshly negative coverage from pro-Trump media outlets. You can read the full article below: Coronavirus cases remain high in Florida, one of the US hotspots for the virus. On Saturday, the state\u2019s health department reported 9,591 new cases of the disease and 179 new deaths. It is the fifth day in a row the state has reported more than 9,000 new cases, although it is down from the recent period when more than 10,000 new daily cases were regularly reported. Florida\u2019s Agency for Health Care Administration says 7,942 people are currently in hospital with the virus, down from the just over 8,000 people last weekend. Florida\u2019s department of health says 7,022 people have now died from Covid-19 in the state. A record-setting quarterly fall in US economic growth was announced earlier this week. The news came as another 1.43 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans are far from reaching agreement about how to implement support for the unemployed. An extra $600 in benefits a week was initially given to the unemployed during the pandemic but that aid officially expired on Friday night. Around 20 million people qualified for the payments and they accounted for 15% of the nation\u2019s wages. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer met with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday in Pelosi\u2019s office to discuss the next stage in benefits. Pelosi said she hopes \u201cthat we make progress on a long-term deal\u201d, while Mnuchin told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re just hopeful that they\u2019re willing really to negotiate today, if they are, we\u2019re prepared to make a deal on behalf of the American people.\u201d Democrats want the $600 payments to continue until January, while Republicans want to cut the installments to $200 until states set up a system that sees the unemployed get 70% of their wages before they were laid off. The two parties are still far apart. Democrats see the $600 payments as vital for keeping families and individuals fed and housed during the pandemic, while Republicans believe they discourage people from seeking work. On Friday, Meadows said Democrats are \u201cplaying politics at a critical time\u201d, while Pelosi countered that Republicans are \u201cdisrespectful of the needs of America\u2019s working families.\u201d Erum Salam in Houston has news of the surge in Covid-19 cases in Texas: An older man in an orange apron greets customers at the Home Depot in College Station, Texas. Signs serving as a reminder they are living through a pandemic are plastered on the sliding glass doors: \u201cFace covering required.\u201d The reminder is much needed because to an outsider, Texas looked almost the same in July 2019 as it does in July 2020, despite Covid-19 having claimed more than 6,000 lives in the state and more than 150,000 lives in the US since March. Customers at the home improvement store walk in wearing masks, which have become highly politicized, only to lower them below their chins to speak or remove them altogether. In the upscale neighborhood of Montrose in Houston, the multi-story Agora coffee house is full of people hungry for coffee, pastries and conversation. It\u2019s difficult to spot an open seat inside or outside on the patio. It\u2019s also difficult to spot anyone wearing anything resembling a face covering. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, a Republican, caught flak for allowing the reopening of bars, restaurants, movie theaters and shopping malls back in early May. In June, he said that Texas was \u201cwide open for business\u201d. Now in late July, more than four months into the Covid-19 pandemic, a mandatory mask order is in place across the state \u2013 a reversal from Abbott\u2019s initial position that the government should not infringe on personal rights by telling citizens what to do. But, with little enforcement except by some businesses, some worry Abbott\u2019s reversals are too little, too late. As hospitals struggle and cases mount, much of ordinary life in Texas still appears to continue as normal. You can read the full story below: Donald Trump has arrived at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. It\u2019s the 12th day he has spent golfing out of the last 36. His motorcade was booed by a group of dogwalkers, while another person held a sign up reading \u201cWe are good trouble\u201d, a reference to congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis who died last month. A man in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap saluted the motorcade as it passed. The president fired off a few tweets last night, repeating his familiar line that Covid-19 cases in the US are surging due to increased testing (which doesn\u2019t explain the sharp rise in deaths). He also turned his attention to a familiar enemy: protesters in Portland. \u201cHomeland Security is not leaving Portland until local police complete cleanup of Anarchists and Agitators!\u201d he tweeted on Friday night. And no sooner has Karen Bass emerged as a frontrunner for Biden\u2019s vice-presidential pick than stories, probably not discouraged by her rivals, bubble to the surface. Rightwing website the Daily Caller reports that Bass praised Scientology for its \u201ccommitment\u2026to make a difference\u201d during the opening of a Scientology building in California in 2010. During the ceremony Bass also praised Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard for his belief that \u201call people of whatever race, color or creed, are created with equal rights\u201d. Scientology has come under intense scrutiny after claims of physical, psychological and sexual abuse against its followers, accusations detailed in documentaries such as Going Clear by Alex Gibney, which focused on former members of the church. The Church of Scientology denies the allegations of abuse and mistreatment among its ranks. Good morning. As November\u2019s election approaches speculation over who Joe Biden will pick as his running mate mounts. The presumptive Democratic candidate for president has promised he will pick a woman as his running mate and his list of candidates is beginning to narrow. CNN reports that 11 candidates are in the running. Kamala Harris remains the oddsmakers\u2019 favourite, and Biden was seen holding a list with her name and handwritten notes about the California senator on it. However, in recent days, Karen Bass, congresswoman and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, has emerged as a frontrunner, and Politico reports that members of Harris\u2019s team requested a meeting with Biden after learning their candidate was not a shoo-in for the VP slot. Harris is reported to have suffered after not showing contrition for remarks she made last year that appeared to depict Biden as racially insensitive. Biden was supposed to name his running mate next week, but Politico reports the selection is now more likely to be announced in mid-August. Other names in the running who have been vetted by Biden\u2019s team include Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth; Florida congresswoman Val Demings; Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms; and governors Gretchen Whitmer and Michelle Lujan Grisham. Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a Biden supporter, told CNN that Bass is seen as a safer choice than Harris. \u201cKamala can rub some people the wrong way. Karen Bass is not likely to do that,\u201d Rendell said. \u201cThe number one rule for picking the VP? Do no harm.\u201d One outside candidate gaining some momentum is Susan Rice, Barack Obama\u2019s former national security adviser. Although she lacks the campaigning experience of Bass and Harris, she worked with Biden during his own time as vice-president and has vast experience in global relations, which could prove invaluable during a time of turmoil around the world. \u201cIf there ever was a time to pick someone without campaign experience, this would be the year,\u201d a former member of Obama\u2019s administration who has worked closely with Rice told CNN. \u201cSusan would be the best governing partner.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
