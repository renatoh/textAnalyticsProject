At Sauber, the announcement from BMW that the Formula One team had found a \"strong investor\" has apparently been undermined. The Swiss newspaper Sonntags Zeitung tracked down Oswald Gr\u00fcbel, the chief executive of UBS and on the BMW Sauber board, who called the transaction a \"possible sale\". There has not been a BMW Sauber board meeting in the three weeks since the deal was announced. A spokesman for Notts County said Gr\u00fcbel had not been party to talks with Qadbak and \"so his comments are not of any relevance\". County also dispute the significance of the denial by Moeen Qureshi that he knows anything of Qadbak. The former prime minister of Pakistan was named by the League Two club as \"a member of the trust which financed the purchase of the club\". Qadbak points out that this means he \"is a member of the family, not one of the investors\". Then there is Swiss Commodity Holding, which purports to have built \u00a3100bn in assets under management since its inception earlier this year and of whom Sven-Goran Eriksson, County's director of football, is a significant shareholder. Sonntags Zeitung says only Nathan and Peter Willett, both Qadbak directors, are left as members of Swiss Commodity Holding's board since the resignation of its Swiss nominee. Under Swiss company law, that means a new Swiss citizen must be found or the company will be dissolved. The Willetts would not comment, but it would be a careless way to lose \u00a3100bn. Icelanders feel chill West Ham United's ultimate owner, Straumur, has admitted it will have only one shot at survival before the Icelandic courts initiate a forced sale of assets after 11 December. The former bank had hoped to persuade its creditors that turning itself into an asset management company would be best for everyone but minor creditors have thrown a spanner in those works. The matter will not be put to the vote until the end of November. In the meantime, offers for West Ham are invited at Straumur's Reykjavik headquarters. Premier party time The surest sign yet that the political wind is blowing in a new direction comes with the Premier League decamping to the Tory party conference. The league's head of public affairs, Bill Bush, was a chief of staff to \"Red\" Ken Livingstone at the Greater London Council in the 1980s. Bush was also Tony Blair's head of research at No 10. Other senior Premier League figures, also staunch Labourites, have headed up to Manchester. They point out that after years of absence the Premier League attended the conference last year too but that just demonstrates how Bush's knowledge of the lay of the political land has not gone to waste. A fit and proper mess What a weird world is that inhabited by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile. In between writing coercive letters to key FIA figures its president, Max Mosley, revealed last week that 20 people recently turned up to the World Motorsport Council to find Bernie Ecclestone at the table. Nothing wrong with that, until you consider that they were there to discuss the punishment due to Flavio Briatore for his part in race-fixing in Singapore last year. Briatore and Ecclestone are partners in Queens Park Rangers. A ban from the WMSC could entail Briatore being ordered out by the Football League, under its \"fit-and-proper\" protocols. That presents a clear conflict of interest, affecting Ecclestone's financial interests outside motor sport. But as far as FIA corporate governance \"processes\" are concerned, that is no bar to participating in discussion about Briatore's sanction, and apparently still less to voting on it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
