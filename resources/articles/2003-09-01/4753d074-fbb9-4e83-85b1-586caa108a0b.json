Police described the explosion as a terrorist attack, and early reports said that emergency workers had found a body believed to be that of the suicide bomber. Officers believe that the bomber may have been female. Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reported that Israeli police had chased a vehicle spotted fleeing the site of the bombing. The paper said that the car was supposedly heading towards Netanya. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said the blast occurred at a bus stop at an entrance to the Tzrifin camp, one of the largest in central Israel. The camp is adjacent to a major hospital. The explosion occurred near the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Letzion. Reports said that many soldiers were waiting at the post. Israeli authorities had been on high alert for terror attacks in the wake of Saturday's botched attempt to kill Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder and spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas. Security was especially tight in Jerusalem. \"The attack today is further indication that the Palestinian Authority is doing absolutely nothing whatsoever to rein in terrorists or to dismantle the terror infrastructure in their areas,\" said David Baker, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. Mr Sharon is on a visit to India."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
