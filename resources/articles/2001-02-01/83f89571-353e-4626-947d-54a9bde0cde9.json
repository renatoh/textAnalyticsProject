You can quickly assume responsibilities that in other careers would not come your way for years. It is intellectually stimulating, creative and endlessly varied, and gives you the opportunity to influence young minds, to shape lives for the better. There has never been a better time to enter teaching. New training salaries worth \u00a36,000 a year and other financial incentives pay you to train, and salaries and rewards for extra skills and responsibilities have been greatly improved. The pay scale goes well beyond \u00a330,000 for a leading classroom teacher and to \u00a380,000 or more for a headteacher. Training is no longer restricted to years of study at university or college. Around 10% of would-be teachers train through programmes tailored to their individual needs and circum stances and taking account of previous experience. This route can involve part-time study fitted around a full-time job, or short intensive study. All routes include classroom experience. New teachers are in demand. For your first job, your options are wide open, with over 20,000 maintained schools and nearly half a million teaching posts in England and Wales. For graduates, the most popular route to gaining Qualified Teacher Status is by taking a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE). These are usually full-time and last a year, but some part-time and distance learning courses, normally over two years, are available. The courses combine subject and professional studies with teaching experience, and are offered by higher education institutions in partnership with local schools. Some schools, or groups of schools, are also accredited to offer training. Ideally, your degree - or equivalent - should reflect the subject you're planning to specialise in. If it doesn't quite fit, your course provider may feel your degree contains enough subject-based knowledge and take you on. If not, you will be advised how to get the knowledge you need. There are also employment-based routes. The Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) offers people of 24 and over the security of working in a school as a teacher, on a salary of up to \u00a313,000, while training. Top priority, in England, goes to high-quality trainees in good schools teaching specified subjects or to those from under-represented groups. Eligible postgraduate trainee teachers in England, who are resident in the UK, receive a \u00a36,000 training salary - the equivalent of \u00a3150 a week - while they are training. Anyone following flexible training can claim \u00a33,000 during their training and another \u00a33,000 on achieving QTS. An additional \u00a34,000 - popularly known as a golden hello - is available for eligible postgraduates teaching mathematics, science, modern foreign languages, design and technology or ICT in England. You can claim this when you have successfully completed your induction and embark on your second year of teaching in a maintained school, provided this is within five years of the start of the first academic year after you achieve QTS. This money is not a loan and there are no fees to pay back. People training to teach certain subjects in secondary schools - maths, science, modern foreign languages, design and technology, ICT, religious education, music or geography - may be eligible for awards based on financial need. Some arrangements are different in Wales. An incentive payment of \u00a36,000 is available to postgraduates beginning primary or secondary initial teacher training from September 2001. Trainees who go on to teach in maths, science, technology, modern foreign languages or Welsh will also be entitled to a \u00a34,000 incentive payment after completing their first year of teaching successfully. Ralph Tabberer is head of the Teacher Training Agency The Teacher Information Line (0845 6000 991 or, for Welsh speakers, 0845 6000 992) is a free information service.

Applications to most postgraduate courses are through the Graduate Teacher Training Registry (GTTR 01242 223 707) or its website (www.gttr.ac.uk)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
