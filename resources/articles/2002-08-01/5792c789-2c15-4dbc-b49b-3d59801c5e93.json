But Schofield's unorthodoxy at once unsettled Sussex and his 36 from 50 balls was the top score of the Lancashire innings, although he did not finish the job and it needed a lusty boundary from John Wood off the first ball of the last over from Kevin Innes to complete a win which retains Lancashire's mathematical chance of promotion Sussex, however, remain rock bottom of the Second Division, their players continuing to show ingratitude for their committee's boldness in installing permanent floodlights four years ago They slumped to 79 for six after Chris Adams chose to bat first and, even after Matt Prior and Innes had steadied the ship with a seventh-wicket stand of 45, they both threw their wickets away Glen Chapple did the early damage with the wickets of Adams, Richard Montgomerie and Tony Cottey, the last two both caught behind by Jamie Haynes, who was deputising behind the stumps for the injured Warren Hegg Kyle Hogg then confirmed what Lancashire have been missing during his lengthy absence with England's under-19s by having Robin Martin-Jenkins and Murray Goodwin caught by Haynes. Martin-Jenkins walked but Goodwin was reluctant to go even when given out. The Zimbabwean had struck five fours in his 40, his best score in a lean League season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
