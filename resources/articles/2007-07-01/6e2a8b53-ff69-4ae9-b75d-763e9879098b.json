Such an incident occurred to me on Saturday. I was sitting on the sofa around nine o'clock, busily weighing up whether Amir Khan's lack of a nickname was a positive or negative thing. On the downside, the absence of a nom de guerre is clearly a hindrance to the Lancastrian when it comes to the ring announcer's introduction. Boxing MCs need a name they can really wrap their chops around and frankly \"Amir Khan\" just isn't long enough to get the full treatment (or \"Ffffffull-ah trrrrrreat-ah-ment-ah\", as the late Jimmy Lennon might have put it). This is where a good soubriquet comes in. Not only does a nickname give the MC a fistful of extra consonants to chew on, it also affords him the chance to engage in that weird nomenclature echo in which the men in the tuxedos specialise: \"Introducing Tim 'Terrible Tim' Witherspoon\" or \"In the blue corner, Donald 'The Lone Star Cobra Curry' Curry\". At the moment the lad from Bolton simply does not have sufficient syllables to bring the best out of the likes of Michael \"Let's get ready to rrrrrrrrrrrrumble Buffer\" Buffer. On the other hand, a fistic nickname can be a sign of misdirected energy. Some boxers, like teenagers who spend so much time making lists of brilliant names for bands that they don't have any left for guitar practice, expend far too much effort on polishing their names and not enough in the gym. It is a useful rule of thumb that the more elaborate a boxer's nickname, the more likely he is to find himself watching his gumshield bounce off the bonce of that bloke in the third row, the one who used to be in Dynasty. Amir Khan may just be a fighter so good they named him once. As I reached this happy conclusion, thought up a catchy slogan for Michael Sprott - \"Floats like a buttertub, stings like a bidet\" - and prepared to embark on an internal debate about why boxers' shorts have got so long, my 10-year-old daughter walked into the room and asked what I was doing. Had I replied truthfully - \"I am thinking of Sharmba Mitchell's trunks, a set of nether garments which give the impression the former world champ had somehow lost his pants in a lightshade shop and been forced to improvise with what was at hand\" - then all would have been well. Instead I fibbed slightly and told her I was watching the Amir Khan fight. \"Oh great,\" she said. \"Can I watch it too?\" Many might have considered her too young. I didn't. I was eight when I was taken to my first boxing match, a schoolboy international, England v Scotland. The venue was the assembly hall of a Teesside school. The fighters walked to the ring down a corridor plastered with French verbs and posters charting the journey of the cocoa bean from West Africa to the corner shop. The great excitement of the evening was that Kevin Barlow, a boy from my village, was fighting at welterweight. In obeisance to tradition, every village in England has one family that selflessly volunteers to handle all criminal activity in the parish. In our village the Barlows were that family. Kevin Barlow did not have a boxing nickname but the prevailing view was that, if he had, the ring announcer would have introduced him as Kevin \"A thoroughly bad lot Barlow\" Barlow. Kevin Barlow was widely regarded as a dangerous reprobate. Unfortunately, on the night in question he found himself in the ring with a boy from Glasgow. I have no wish to engage in regional stereotyping here, but I think it is fair to say that in a fight between the hardest boy in Glasgow and the hardest boy from a North Riding village there will generally only be one winner. Kevin Barlow took a right pasting. And though it may not have done him much good, it certainly did me no harm. And so I readily agreed to my daughter watching Amir Khan in action. I soon regretted my decision. Right from the bell she took no interest in the finer points of the pugilistic arts - hand speed, footwork, ability to spit right into the bucket even when very, very tired - and instead peppered me with irrelevant questions such as \"Are they allowed to bash each other on the head like that?\" and \"Doesn't it hurt?\". Finally, in round seven, she asked: \"Why is the Scottish man's mouth bleeding?\" \"Because,\" I replied, \"Amir Khan keeps punching him in it.\" No sooner had these words passed my lips than I was overcome with revulsion. I have watched boxing for close to 40 years and it was not until that moment that the full barbaric awfulness of it all came home to me. As so often is the case, it took an innocent child to open an adult's eyes to the truth. My daughter had taught me an important life lesson. I will never watch boxing again. Well, not unless she's in another room with a Lindsay Lohan DVD, anyway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
