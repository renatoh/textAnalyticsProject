England blame game begins", "bodyText": "If there is a small corner of a foreign field that remains forever England, you won't find it inside the Maksymir Stadium in Zagreb. A calamitous 2-0 defeat at the hands of Croatia last night, achieved thanks to a disastrous divot and an ill-conceived tactical approach, left England's chances of qualification for Euro 2008 in jeopardy and Steve McClaren's reign as coach looking shaky after just five games. Perhaps only one man will remember this chastening defeat less fondly than McClaren. Goalkeeper Paul Robinson was left looking like a Sunday morning scuffler by a cruel bobble as he attempted to clear an innocuous looking back-pass from Gary Neville. As the Spurs keeper drew back his leg to belt a clearance downfield the ball bounced up over his boot and rolled into the net. Robinson looked distraught at the final whistle but he was not the only one. For McClaren this defeat, four days after a dismal 0-0 draw against Macedonia, leaves his predictions of a bold new era for the national side looking hollow. The decision to deploy his side in a 3-5-2 formation they had practised just four times in 10 days looked deeply misguided against opponents who have never lost a qualifying game at home. Designed to prevent the opposition scoring, it made England's defence look as vulnerable as at any time in the last five years and left accomplished players such as Rio Ferdinand and Ashley Cole looking uncomfortable. McClaren's appointment was greeted with scepticism even inside the FA where he was second choice behind Brazilian Luiz Felipe Scolari. Comfortable wins over Greece and Andorra followed by a 1-0 win in Macedonia kept the doubters at bay, but after gaining one point from the six available in the last week McClaren faces an uncomfortable five months until England's next competitive match. For the record, the shortest tenure of a full-time England coach was that of Kevin Keegan who lasted 19 months and 21 days. McClaren has clocked up two months and 10 days, and while the panic button will not be pushed yet the odds on him out lasting Keegan have shortened dramatically."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
