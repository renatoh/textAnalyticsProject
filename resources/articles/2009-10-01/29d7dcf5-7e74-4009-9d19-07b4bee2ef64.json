Employing deadpan one-liners (\"I think the worst time to have a heart attack is during a game of charades\"); crude drawings (his Pie Chart Of Procrastination featured a blank circle); animation (he lists Far Side cartoonist Gary Larson as a major inspiration); music of a distinctly uncomplicated variety and natural nerdy awkward charm, US viewers have made Martin the acceptable face of the modern male geek. Demetri Martin is also one of the funniest-looking men on American TV. He has the kind of face where a cartoon version would look more or less identical to the real him. On top of his perfectly oval face, he wears what he calls \"a gay Beatles haircut\" but it is equally probable that he asked his barber to go all out for the Lego Minifig look. He has puppy dog eyes (specifically, a beagle in need of a hug); while his nose is of the variety small children draw on witches \u2013 triangular and of magical proportions. He's un-starry and bashful about his fame. He won't go on Twitter because little of what he does passes his own \"who gives a shit?\" test (although 50,000 followers of a fake Demetri Martin may beg to differ) and he describes much of his writing process as \"sifting through crap, then polishing some of it\". Now, thanks to E4's wise decision to start showing his brilliantly smart and likably silly series Important Things With Demetri Martin, he is the funniest man on British TV, too. Which is only right, because, after all, we did discover him. Sort of. Way back in the mists of time (AKA 2003) Martin wrote a stand-up show entitled If I which he performed at the Edinburgh festival fringe. He won the Perrier Award and a BBC one-off followed. Then, rather than become a mainstay of the panel show circuit he returned to his day job as writer on Conan O'Brien's chatshow. Quite why Martin didn't capitalise fully on his Edinburgh success remains a mystery, though a well-paid but disastrous corporate after-dinner show at a London hotel shortly afterwards for the elderly employees of a mutual fund may have played some part. \"It was a really old-school function. There were old men wearing tuxedos, and some of them even had medals, and I was just some unknown kid from America,\" he recalls. \"So, this guy hits this gavel and says, 'Gentlemen! I suggest you turn your chairs around to enjoy the entertainment!' I go out there with my little guitar and my jokes and I just died. \"The worst part was they had these large, flat-panel televisions simultaneously broadcasting my performance around the room, so as well as dying on stage I got to see what my failure looked like.\" 'I find it more enjoyable to watch comedy that references something very basic, that doesn't need specialised knowledge' As well as his TV series and stand-up shows Demetri is also making inroads as an actor (he stars as accidental festival organiser Elliot Tiber in Taking Woodstock), and screenwriter (he successfully pitched his own screenplay, Will \u2013 about our actions being controlled by a team of writers in heaven \u2013 to Steven Spielberg). Martin grew up in New Jersey, the son of a Greek Orthodox priest and a nutritionist, and worked part-time in the family diner, The Sand Castle. When he wasn't waiting on tables he would practise his skateboarding skills or brush up on his hobbies of solving word puzzles or writing palindromes; check out his 224-word palindrome poem Dammit I'm Mad. By his own admission he partook in a selection of pastimes that were \"the very opposite of things that would get you laid\". In early adulthood he would add unicycling and juggling to his uncool repertoire. During his brief time at law school (\"At the age of 11, I decided that I would be a lawyer, not knowing particularly anything about it, I just liked the sound of it\"), he wore a gorilla suit for comic effect. Followers of The Daily Show may remember Martin as the occasional youth correspondent between 2005 and 2007, charged with keeping viewers abreast of current trends such as the Xbox 360 (Demetri presented a flowchart of must-have Christmas items starting with frankincense), video r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, wine and hookahs. Demetri is still puzzled as to why he was given this role, although the fact that he looks like a teenager but is in his mid-30s and favours sensible slacks over low-slung jeans may have been a factor in him being charged with a role where he would forever attempt to get his interviewees to say things that were \"a bit more youthy\". You may also remember Demetri as the keytar-playing half of The Crazy Dogggz, in his rare but momentous appearance in a Flight Of The Conchords episode from season one that featured worldwide novelty hit The Doggy Bounce. A similarly absurdist sense of humour informs Important Things, which finds Demetri focusing jokes and sketches each week around a single topic (Time, Power, Chairs, \"I may do the colour green in the next series\"). But, unlike Flight Of The Conchords and virtually every comedy show of the moment, one thing that's refreshing is that it's doesn't rely on pastiches or parodies of something else. \"I see it as a challenge to make things which are more primary source, rather than secondary,\" he says scientifically. \"I find it more enjoyable when I watch comedy that references something that's very basic so I don't have to have specialised knowledge to get the joke.\" Important Things has the air of a TV show made by someone who doesn't watch much TV; he claims to have watched DVDs of Brass Eye and I'm Alan Partridge but little else over the past decade. Many of the jokes in Important Things are succinct, but still layered with more than one punchline, a technique he learned from Woody Allen. 'The absence of snark makes such a delightful change. I'm a fan of non-snarky things' \"A lot of the things I liked comedically when I was growing up, like Steven Wright, shared the trait of brevity,\" he says. \"They didn't take long getting to the punchline. When I heard Woody Allen's stand-up I thought that was kind of similar. It was more anecdotal but, within each story, there's a lot of punchlines. There's not many wasted words.\" He's also happy to acknowledge that his comedy is deliberately devoid of the curse of our age \u2013 snark, the snide sarcasm that first infected the internet but has now spread across pop culture. \"My friends and I talk about it all the time. It's weird. I watched a bunch of movies from the 70s with my girlfriend recently and I felt so sort of sweet after each movie. And it was like, 'What is that?', and she said, 'None of the movies were snarky.' The absence of snark was such a delightful change. So, I don't know, I'm a fan of non-snarky things.\" Girls love him. Men love him. Old ladies love him and even those snarky young kids love him. You will too. Old men hate his guts, though. Must be the juggling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
