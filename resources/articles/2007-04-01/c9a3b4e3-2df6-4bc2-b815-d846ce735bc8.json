As Brown acknowledges today that he has been damaged by his neighbour's determination to notch up 10 years in Downing Street, the Prime Minister is telling friends that the time is fast approaching to heal wounds. Blair's decision to offer his support to his former political soulmate is outlined by Tessa Jowell, one of Blair's closest cabinet allies. 'I am sure he will endorse Gordon,' the Culture Secretary told The Observer, and indicated that Blair would make an announcement no later than mid-May, when nominations for the Labour leadership are expected to close. Blair is expected to announce on 10 May - a week after this week's local and devolved elections - his intention to leave Downing Street in early July. His decision will please the Chancellor who gives a hint today in a television interview of his frustration at his long wait to move into Number 10. The Chancellor, who had once hoped to succeed Blair at the end of Labour's second term, is asked by The Observer's Andrew Rawnsley on ITV1's Sunday Edition whether the Prime Minister has hung around too long and whether that has damaged him. 'Yes, well, that, you have, you have to establish,' a stumbling Brown replies as he indicates that Labour is bracing itself for poor results in this week's elections across Britain. He also says that blame for any poor results on Thursday should not be simply laid at Blair's door. The Prime Minister's decision to offer an early endorsement of Brown all but guarantees a coronation of the Chancellor, who may face a challenge from the left but is highly unlikely to face a serious challenge from a Blairite such as Charles Clarke. The Blair move also shows that Labour knows it has to close ranks as David Cameron leads in the polls, which will be reinforced on Thursday when Labour is likely to take a drubbing in the English local elections. David Blunkett, the former Home Secretary, yesterday gave a blunt assessment of Labour's chances: 'While there will be undoubtedly a big hit on morale, we've really got to pull ourselves together and ride that and recognise that we do have time to pull it round.' Friends of Blair, who will celebrate his 10th anniversary as Prime Minister on Tuesday, say he is delaying his resignation announcement to 'take the hit' on the poor election results. Labour could find itself wiped out from many councils in southern England. A new opinion poll shows that Labour's long domination of Scottish politics appears to be entering its final days. The YouGov opinion poll gives the Scottish National Party its most convincing lead yet with an eight-point gap in the first-past-the-post constituency vote and a five-point margin in the 'top-up' section. The SNP is on track to win 47 seats in the 129-seat Scottish Parliament, seven more than Labour. The Liberal Democrats would have 18 MSPs, the Conservatives 18, the Greens five and other parties one. A separate British-wide poll shows Labour slumping to its lowest level since 1987. The Ipsos MORI poll places the Tories on 38 per cent, with Labour on 31 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 20 per cent. Ben Page, of Ipsos MORI, described the figures as Labour's 'lowest sustained' position in the opinion polls since 1987 - a full 10 years before it regained power. The poll also makes unhappy reading for the Chancellor. His net satisfaction rating is at minus 13 per cent - the lowest since the fuel protests in September 2000 - while his Budget was poorly received. When asked whether the Budget was good for the country, it received a net rating of minus 16 per cent, the lowest rating for a budget since the Tories were in power. Brown today indicates that he is fully aware of the challenge facing both him and the Labour party. 'All governments go through phases,' the Chancellor tells Sunday Edition. But he adds that he expects to pull through. 'I think you've got to remember that before 1987 people thought the Conservatives would lose, before 1992 people thought the Conservatives would lose, but they actually won.' In a sign of his growing confidence, Brown flatly rules out calling a snap general election when he enters Number 10, quashing a Tory campaign to capitalise on Cameron's high poll ratings. 'Well, I didn't hear Cameron or the Conservatives calling for a general election the minute that John Major took over in 1990,' he says. Cameron will today pile the pressure on Brown by honing in on what Tories hope will be his main weak spot - the challenge to present himself as a fresh face. In a campaign speech in Swindon, Wiltshire, the Tory leader will say: 'On Tuesday, we'll have had 10 years of Blair and Brown. On Thursday, you can tell them what you think of their 10 years. It's your last chance to vote against Tony Blair. It's your first chance to vote against Gordon Brown.' Brown will receive a boost tomorrow when Jowell, who said she would be supporting him as leader, uses a major policy speech to call for an end to Labour's 'tribalism' in order to concentrate on reconnecting with ordinary voters. 'We have to bring an end to tribalism in New Labour. No more Blairites and Brownites,' she will tell the New Labour think-tank Progress. 'It is time to open up a wider conservation with the people of Britain.' Jowell reached her decision to vote for the Chancellor some time ago, but friends said she had held off until the eve of the Progress speech in order to drive home her view that inward-looking personality battles were far less important than focusing on policies. The party's challenge, she will say in her speech, is to unite around a radical new vision of 'OurSpace' government - applying the social and political changes reflected in network sites such as MySpace to changing the way government relates to people. 'This is a generation looking for a \"show me\" rather than a \"tell me\" government,' she will say. 'People want more control today... to be players, not just spectators. People want to feel they are the agents of change, rather than its victims.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
