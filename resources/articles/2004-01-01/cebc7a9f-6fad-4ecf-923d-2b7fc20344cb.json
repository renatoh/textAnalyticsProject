Speaking after her meeting with Geoff Hoon, Mrs Roberts' said she still believed the defence secretary should \"consider his position\". \"Mr Hoon has not accepted responsibility ... however he has given assurances that the lessons will be examined closely,\" she told a news conference. She insisted there was a lot that he could do to satisfy her concerns in the wake of her husband's death. \"He could say who is responsible for Steve's death and apologise for the fact Steve did not have the enhanced body armour.\" Sergeant Steven Roberts, 33, was shot dead by \"friendly fire\" while trying to quell a riot just days after being told to hand back his flak jacket because there were not enough to go round. Samantha Roberts, 32, has called on Mr Hoon to quit his cabinet job over failures to get vital kit to soldiers. It will be the second time the pair have met, but Mrs Roberts has recently gone on a media offensive by releasing audio tapes of her husband's diary, calling on Mr Hoon to resign \"for the good of the country\" and saying he has \"blood on his hands\". Her cause has been taken up by several newspapers, while Mr Hoon is also facing a fight for his political life with the publication next week of the Hutton report into the death of Ministry of Defence scientist David Kelly. Mrs Roberts' cause has also been championed by Liberal Democrat MP Paul Tyler, who this morning said the defence secretary has to \"take responsibility for his ministry\". At a Commons select committee last May, Mr Hoon \"dared to suggest the only failures of supply related to wrong-sized boots and unappetising rations\", Mr Tyler told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"Those have been blown to smithereens by the revelations not just of his own army commanders later to the committee but also by the National Audit Office,\" he said. \"Unless ministers are prepared to take responsibility for hugely important strategic issues of this sort, what is the point of having a minister in charge?\" Mr Tyler added he did not want to prejudge the outcome of the meeting. \"When we have seen an explanation then we can decide whether a resignation should follow,\" he said. \"But the critical issue is the extent to which Mr Hoon is prepared to take responsibility. \"I think that the Roberts family are absolutely right to be outraged at the extent to which lawyer-speak has been there rather than the truth.\" Sgt Roberts, from Shipley, near Bradford, West Yorkshire, was serving with the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment when he was killed by his own side in Zubayr, near Basra, on March 24 last year. Mr Hoon has said he was \"extremely sorry\" for the death of Sgt Roberts and \"extremely sorry\" the soldier did not have enhanced body armour. But Mrs Roberts, who had a first private meeting with Mr Hoon in October last year, has said the minister should resign \"for the good of the country\". Mrs Roberts said she was looking forward to speaking to Mr Hoon at his Whitehall office this afternoon but she declined to give details of what she was planning to say at the meeting. \"Hopefully it will be worthwhile but we will see,\" she said. Also due to attend the meeting were Sgt Roberts's mother, Marion Chapman, his brother, Tristan Tancock, and Mr Tyler, who represents north Cornwall, where the soldier grew up. Last week, Mrs Roberts released a taped audio diary recorded by her husband while he was in Iraq. In the tapes, Sgt Roberts described his worries about being sent into battle without proper equipment and body armour - a situation he described as \"a joke\". A MoD investigation into Sgt Roberts' death is still ongoing. Meanwhile Downing Street today refused to be drawn into a row over whether or not Mr Hoon may said that Dr Kelly was not a \"martyr\". Pressed about Mr Hoon's reported comment, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"I believe this report is speculation in the run-up to the publication of the Hutton report and I'm not going to do anything to encourage speculation. \"We will let Lord Hutton's report speak for itself and Lord Hutton speak for himself and then we will be in a better position to answer your question. \"I'm not going to comment on what's a third-hand account in a Sunday newspaper.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
