Ever since our first edition, 25 years ago, which contained 300 hotels, Continental hotels have outnumbered British hotels in the Guide, a clear indication of our readers' preferences. In 1978, 55 of the entries were French, 43 Italian. The Guide is now published in two volumes, one covering Great Britain and Ireland, the other Continental Europe, with a combined total of 1,600 hotels. One thousand are on the Continent with 18 countries represented. France remains the favourite with 400 hotels. Italy still comes second with 131. Correspondents regularly write to tell us of the good value, delicious food and child-friendliness they find on the Continent. Since no hotel pays for its entry, and the Guide takes no hospitality or advertising, we can, unlike many others, tell it as it is. Romantic hotels With its castles, monasteries, mountains and lakes, the Continent is full of romantic hotels, some grand and expensive, others quite modest.
