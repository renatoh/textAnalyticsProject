This was an exceptional Saturday. For a start, it was my father's birthday, so that accounts for some of my spend: two books I knew he wanted, plus the bunch of flowers. I like buying flowers, especially for men. These were beautiful flowers - sparkling lilies and vivid roses, they smelt like the garden of Eden and I knew they'd last at least a week. No guilt there then: this was money well and properly spent. Which leaves just the decontextualised \u00a3583.15 to beat myself up about. That's a lot of money. I didn't know I'd spent that much. I have, somehow, over the years, evolved a mental trick which involves treating each separate purchase on any one day as the only purchase, therefore avoiding the bothersome, not to mention guilt-inducing business of tallying a running total. I don't know how I created this trick but it has always worked very well - until now, as I sit writing an article about shopping and attempting to articulate its attendant mysterious drives, its small miseries and joys (note the order: miseries first. Old Protestant habits die hard). I've always thought that my approach to shopping is essentially feminine, but this turns out not necessarily to be the case. 'I never feel guilty about \"need\" shopping, just about \"want shopping\",' observes branding consultant B J Cunningham. 'Nobody needs a CD, for example, but when I'm feeling low I'll purchase shit-loads of CDs. The logic is: \"These are cool, so they'll make me feel cool, too.\" But then I'll also buy them when I'm feeling fantastic, when they become a symbol of potency: \"I've just closed that deal and I feel great, so I deserve this.\" In fact, I've bought a lot of CDs lately because I've just become a father and I'm feeling very good about life.' Bob Tyrrell is chairman of Sociovision (trend-watchers whose clients have included the Conservative Party and the NHS, as well as retailers) and is currently working on research into the future of consumerism for the think-tank Demos. For him, this idea of 'becoming what you've bought' is a throwback to a time when consumer choices were largely based on a combination of economics (reflected by forward-planning and shopping lists as means of avoiding succumbing to temptation) and on knowing our social place. 'Since the 60s and subsequently, post-Thatcherism, we don't \"know our place\" anymore. We don't necessarily keep up with the Joneses or worry about buying white wine to drink with red meat, for example. We are far more open to alternatives and so there is a shift away from the sense that who you are dictates what you buy - to the point where it is far more likely that what you buy expresses who you are.' If, 40 years ago, shopping was largely motivated by a combination of subsistence needs and status wants, now people are apparently buying 'experiences'. Tyrrell describes this as a much more self-referential, even existential way of consuming ('How long have you been yourself?'). In this environment, it is far tougher for retailers to predict shifts in the way we consume, given that consuming is now so intensely personal, even emotional. Tyrrell offers the example of a lifelong BMW owner suddenly shifting his allegiance to a different marque, despite being entirely happy with the BMW as a product. But, in this increasingly demand-led rather than supply-driven economy, when we're 'want' shopping, rather than 'need' shopping, what 'experience' is it that we're buying precisely? A simulacrum of happiness? A fleeting omnipotence? An advertising fantasy? An idealised self-image and all-areas access to a less mundane world? Are we shopping to celebrate, or pick ourselves up? (And is Selfridges my personal household-goods god?). Just like BJ, I'll be more likely to binge-shop when I'm either unhappy or elated. For example, a few years ago I was suffering from clinical depression and one of the ways this manifested was that I shrunk to a size eight (briefly) for the first time since my teens, so I filled many hours buying the kind of clothes I'd never wear (teenage clothes, to be frank) simply because I could - however, this brought me no joy at all because I wasn't really the person I was kidding myself I might be. On the other hand, when I'm happy I'll buy flowers and books and organic food. At these times, I don't feel as if I'm trying to plug any psychological or spiritual holes, just consuming freely and without guilt. But I have also occasionally shopped in a spirit of anger and defiance. I once impulse-bought a diamond eternity ring because, as I told the bemused shop assistant, 'nobody else is ever going to buy me one. That may not be a very healthy motivation but I still like the ring and wear it (on my right hand) every day. At the time, the female friend who accompanied me was enthusiastically supportive. 'I don't see it as an angry purchase, I think it's fantastically empowering for a woman to buy herself diamonds, as long as she doesn't feel guilty.' And, as it happens, on that occasion I didn't feel guilty at all, presumably because anger is a more powerful emotion than guilt. I do not feel the same emotions about every pound of that \u00a3647.18 I spent on 13 October, even though the process of breaking it down into individual items reveals that there are probably only two kinds of shops in which I can spend happily: supermarkets and bookshops. Department stores are the most difficult. In Selfridges, for example, I can work my way through the floors, layer by layer, focused on a speedy, greedy and exhausting cycle of expectancy (the thrill of the chase), desire (I've seen you, I want you), pleasure (I've seen you, I want you - and now, oh bliss, I've got you) and guilt (what did I want you for anyway?). At the end, I can emerge from all of this feeling as drained as if the entire arc of an emotional relationship had been compressed into a few hours. Which, in a way, it has. Interestingly, I had thought my father's present was an entirely guilt-free purchase, but now, seeing how much I spent that day in total, there is a fresh guilt: clearly I should have spent much more on the present (actually, there was something else I wanted to buy him but it wasn't in stock). While I was in the book department, I admit I did pick up something for myself, too, but I don't feel remotely guilty about that. Likewise, I don't feel guilty about the breakfast comestibles bought at my local Tesco Express, or the bottle of wine (a South Australian Cabernet Sauvignon) to accompany a post-binge TV dinner (though, oddly, I do feel slightly guilty about the bottle of Diet Coke, consumed on the hoof in Selfridges, because there's no need to spend one hundred and fifty pence on a bottle of brown fizzy water). No, the stuff that sends me wild with guilt, especially seeing it written down, are the clothes and shoes, because buying fuel, whether actual or intellectual, is 'good', while feeding personal vanity and label-hunger is, obviously, 'bad'. I am, presumably, not worthy. But why? It's my money. I earned it. In fact, these were very sensible and necessary purchases. I could have bought one pair of trousers but I'm a bit flush at the moment - I've recently sold my flat (to be honest, all that liquid cash is burning a hole in my pocket. I really must get it into a bank account I can't touch), so I bought three different pairs: good cut, nice fit, all from Joseph. Look, I needed them. I'll wear them for years. Really. Normally I'd only buy three pairs of trousers in a sale. And the boots? Well, I found the perfect pair of ankle boots in Prada, but they didn't have my size. Then I spotted some similar ones in Miu-Miu, but they didn't have my size either. That really pissed me off. You understand where I'm going with this, don't you? By then, I had to have boots, even if they weren't the boots I really wanted . The Prada boots would have cost \u00a3250 and the ones I ended up buying were \u00a3165, so in fact I saved myself \u00a385 (work with me on this). Ignoring the fact that I still want the Prada boots and that if I do find them in my size - no, I can't think about that right now. There's a war going on, there are people starving out there and I'm prepared to spend \u00a3250 on a pair of boots ? Confessions: some of things I bought on 13 October I've barely looked at since, so clearly it was the buying that was exciting - the wearing can wait. But I don't think I've got a big problem - there are no credit-card debts or piles of wrong-sized shoes gathering dust in the back of the wardrobe. I'm not a sad shopaholic, just an occasional binger. There are an awful lot of us. Though there may be similarities between men and women's motivation to shop impulsively, there is also a difference in the way we go about it: BJ invariably buys his CDs online ('I click Go and get my email confirmation of \"a successful purchase\" and it's over in seconds. I walk away and forget about it, until two or three days later when that package of guilt arrives right on my doorstep'), whereas I have never shopped online because there's not enough foreplay and it's over far too quickly. BJ understands this: 'Yeah, for men it's not the journey that's important, it's the destination, but for you I think the journey is the destination. Women are the true hunter-gatherers.' Georgina Goodman recently graduated from the RCA. She designs shoes. Beautiful, sensual, elegant, sophisticated, intelligent, modernist, architectural shoes - shoes that, when you see them, might just make you gasp. George's RCA thesis was about the psychology of shoes, about desire and sensuality, about need versus want. She even defined a woman's relationship to buying shoes as 'one-night stands' and 'long-term relationships' and wrote about what she describes as 'guilt-slippers': those shoes (invariably bought by women) that are never worn but never quite thrown away, either. George necessarily knows a thing or two about shopping, but admits, 'I would never buy something off the internet because that's not a sensual experience.' George, like me, is a consummate binger, though perhaps less guilty. 'Whether I've got \u00a31,000 or \u00a325 in the bank, I'll think nothing of spending it. I have a special bag which is used for visits to charity shops and street markets, and I won't stop buying until it's full. I'm also addicted to car-boot sales. In fact, I can go and buy things at a car-boot sale that are specifically to be sold at another car-boot sale.' I ask her about the adrenaline rush of the big spend. 'I went to a shop recently and bought two pairs of shoes, which I can always manage to justify as \"research\", even though I own maybe 400 pairs, and then while I was standing at the till waiting to pay I spotted this bag by Marc Jacobs. It was \u00a3650 and I bought it on the spot, which meant I'd spent about \u00a31,000 in total. The girls in the shop got very excited.' And did she? 'Yes, that time the \"rush\", the \"frisson\" of spending, lasted about 40 minutes, which is quite a long time. I was on a roll then. I went straight to a posh deli and bought madly expensive food.' But is there anything she finds difficult to buy? 'Bras.' she concedes. George's bras are, as it were, my trousers. I find it much harder to buy a pair of trousers than I do a jacket, because I dislike my legs and don't want to have to focus on them. Buying trousers effectively reminds me who I really am, rather than allowing me to pretend I'm someone else, and where's the idealistic, escapist joy in that? As a cutting-edge consumer, George has also instinctively grasped Bob Tyrrell's 'How long have you been yourself?' concept: 'My wardrobe is made up of clothes that express different \"me's\", bought in different phases. Choices about what to buy and what to wear are dictated by who I feel I am that day. In that respect, I have never grown out of dressing-up.' I decide that, inside a supermarket or a bookshop, I somehow know exactly who I am - despite all the choices on offer, but that in a clothes shop the possibilities for 'reinvention' are so daunting that I can lose sight of myself. Says Tyrrell: 'When we shop for an idealised self-image, the process of buying can be quite pleasant, right up to the act of consummation.' But surely it might follow that, after we've 'consummated' our relationship (whether it be with a pair of trousers or a Porsche), we'll pause to light the metaphorical cigarette and ask ourselves whether this was really the start of something big or merely a one-night stand. Still, things could be worse - we could be Brazilian. Demos's research reveals that the affirmative response to the proposition: 'I measure success by the things that I own' was 36 per cent in the UK and a terrifying 73 per cent in Brazil. And Versace is very, very popular in Brazil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
