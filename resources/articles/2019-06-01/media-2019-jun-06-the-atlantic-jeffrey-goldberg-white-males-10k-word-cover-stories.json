Jeffrey Goldberg, who has edited the magazine since 2016, made the controversial comments in a Nieman Lab article on how the organization, which is owned by investor Laurene Powell Jobs, has shaken things up and placed more women in editorial positions. Goldberg ran into trouble in a Q&amp;A \u2013 alongside his own executive editor, Adrienne LaFrance \u2013 when he intimated that assigning cover stories to women and minorities on gender and race issues is problematic. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard to write a 10,000-word cover story. There are not a lot of journalists in America who can do it. The journalists in America who do it are almost exclusively white males,\u201d he said. Goldberg\u2019s remarks drew immediate criticism on social media. Writer Lisa Goldman offered on Twitter: \u201cIf Jeffrey Goldberg thinks there\u2019s a lack of women who can write 10k word features, then he\u2019s astonishingly ignorant about his peers &amp; he should step aside for a woman to replace him. Immediately. I\u2019m gobsmacked by this interview. Stunned. What an insult.\u201d Journalist Erik Hinton subsequently rejoined: \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard to suck as bad at your job as Jeffrey Goldberg and the journalists in America who do it are almost exclusively white males.\u201d Goldberg later offered clarification on Twitter, saying he was \u201ctrying to explain (and obviously failed to explain) that white males dominate cover-story writing because they\u2019ve had all the opportunities\u201d. He followed that with an apology: \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make myself clear in this interview, and I\u2019m sorry that I hurt anyone.\u201d The fracas comes on the heels of other embarrassing scandals and missteps at some of America\u2019s prestige journals. Last September, Ian Buruma, editor of the New York Review of Books, exited his position amid an uproar over the publication of an essay by a disgraced Canadian radio broadcaster who had been accused of sexually assaulting women. In December 2016, Lorin Stein, editor of the Paris Review, resigned after an internal investigation into his behavior toward female employees and writers. Stein later apologized for his behavior. In contrast, Goldberg\u2019s job appears safe for now. Goldberg\u2019s Nieman Lab interviewer, Laura Hazard Owen, backed him up (\u201csucks if a stray comment distracts\u201d), as did LaFrance. While journalists assigned to write cover stories in national magazines are disproportionately white men, LaFrance acknowledged, \u201cwe know there are numerous talented women out there who could write our most ambitious stories. Many in our newsroom already are. This is exactly what we\u2019re working on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
