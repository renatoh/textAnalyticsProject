It is not often neither of the Old Firm are involved in the weekend's live TV game but this pair put a resounding case for the best of the rest. The home team, 2-0 behind to goals from Dirk Lehmann and James McFadden, were apparently down and out. Then they stirred from their slumbers to get back in the game through Mark de Vries, equalised with an Andy Kirk header and then remarkably edged ahead with a Steven Boyack strike before completing a fine victory through another from Kirk. \"Both teams tried to play and it made for great entertainment although it wasn't necessarily good for the blood pressure of the two managers,\" said Hearts' Craig Levein. \"We needed to sort out a few things at half-time and I was much happier with our performance after that.\" Before Levein's team had secured the points and gone to the head of the Old Firm-less top 10, Rangers and Celtic had already recorded their own wins to stay well clear of the rest. The Ibrox team, who ousted the champions as pacesetters in midweek, won 2-0 at Livingston through Maurice Ross and a Barry Ferguson penalty although only after the Almondvale midfielder Cherif Toure Maman had been sent off for a second bookable offence. Celtic's John Hartson scored the only goal of their game against Hibernian but the Parkhead talk is of Henrik Larsson's continuing struggle to recapture the goalscoring form which made him such a threat in recent years. His manager Martin O'Neill was moved to defend his prolific striker by saying: \"Henrik will score goals anywhere and will be back in business soon.\" There were no such problems for the Scotland hopeful Stevie Crawford who maintained his good form with a goal in Dunfermline's impressive 2-1 victory at Dundee United. He is front-runner for an international strike role in the next European Championship tie against Iceland. Barry McLaughlin hit an injury-time equaliser for Kilmarnock to earn a 2-2 draw with Aberdeen and there was a 1-1 draw between Partick Thistle and Dundee at Firhill with the home team giving the 39-year-old Chic Charnley the last minute of the action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
