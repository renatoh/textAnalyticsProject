OK. That\u2019s it then. All over. Back to work, boys. Not sure what all the fuss was about. Move on. Unless of course the World Anti-Doping Agency decides in 21 days time to refer it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne. But for that to happen Wada would need to find evidence that has escaped investigators here for the past two plus years. Let\u2019s remind ourselves of the many threats and allegations we\u2019ve heard thus far. First, there was the press conference that became known as the \u201cblackest day in Australian sport\u201d. \u201cCome forward before you get a knock at the door,\u201d Jason Clare, Federal (Labor) Justice Minister, said on that day in February, 2013, while the Federal (Labor) Sports Minister, Kate Lundy, said, \u201cWe are well on the way to seeking out and hunting down those who will dope and cheat.\u201d Much of the media were more than willing to play along. Rumour, innuendo, suspicion was accepted as fact. Here is the ABC\u2019S 7:30 program from 7 February, 2013: \u201cA 12-month investigation by Australia\u2019s top crime body has found performance-enhancing drug use is widespread in the major sporting codes, a habit fed by organised crime. Sports scientists, high-performance coaches and other staff are running the illicit programs.\u201d So how does that description stack up with the facts? The biggest target was the Essendon Football Club in the AFL. Coaches and support staff were demonised and had their reputations trashed publicly. Players were named and also dragged through the mud. All before a single charge had been laid \u2013 or as it turns out, enough evidence gathered to force a single charge. On 31 March of this year, the AFL Anti-Doping Tribunal found 34 past and present Essendon players not guilty of taking banned substances. Not a single one. The findings prompted McDevitt to claim what happened at Essendon was \u201ca disgrace\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s make this clear, this was not a supplements program, this was an injections regime,\u201d he declared, bringing back to life another out-of-context statement made somewhere in the turmoil of this saga, that of, \u201ca pharmacologically experimental regime\u201d. This was a direct reference to the Switkowski report, an internal study into governance at Essendon carried out by leading business figure Dr Ziggy Switkowski. Rarely cited is another part of that report, where Switkowski himself concedes knowledge of supplements was way outside his sphere of knowledge and that\u2019s not what he was reporting on anyway. Then, on Friday just gone, the same Anti-Doping Tribunal released its findings into the sports scientist Dank, the alleged mastermind of this \u201cdoping regime\u201d. Of 34 charges levelled against Dank, 24 were dismissed. The remaining 10 upheld are an interesting mish-mash of also-rans: two relate to baseball (which I, like many, wasn\u2019t aware the AFL had jurisdiction over); one relates to the Medical Rejuvenation Clinic \u2013 a legal business Mr Dank had ties to (again, something I was unaware the AFL had jurisdiction over); three concern support personnel at clubs that were not Essendon or NRL club Cronulla (and involved the individuals being given a supplement they were legally allowed to take); two of them involve \u201cattempting to traffic\u201d and \u201cassisting with trafficking\u201d supplements to a support person at Essendon (again, that legally, they were entitled to have). And, then, these two \u2013 which do relate to Essendon and potentially the players: attempting to traffic and assisting in trafficking to Essendon FC \u2018Humanofort\u2019 \u2013 a supplement alleged, by Asada, to contain a cocktail of banned substances. The only problem is this \u2013 the Therapeutics Good Administration conducted testing on the Humanofort product and found there to be no banned substances, from a human consumption perspective. You and I can visit a number of supplement stores or health food shops and buy it in either powder or tablet form. While that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is a permitted substance for athletes (as the rules are different to the general public and are even different between sports), in my view it\u2019s a good indicator that there isn\u2019t anything nefarious in Humanofort. Needless to say, Dank is appealing the findings. Asada is not. Monday\u2019s events are telling. The then sports minister Lundy declared at the \u201cblackest day\u201d press conference, \u201ctoday is about the integrity of Australian sport\u201d. She was right. It was the day federal government politicians, a crime authority and the anti-doping authority blackened the reputations of Australian athletes. Who pays for that? Who rights the wrongs? Who gives back the two years of trauma and allegations dished out to players and coaches? Asada? No, its role in this whole saga is now over. Just ask Ben McDevitt\u2026oh sorry , he\u2019s not taking any more questions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
