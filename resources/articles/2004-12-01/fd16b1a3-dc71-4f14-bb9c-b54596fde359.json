The National League One leaders will take Wasps' place in the quarter-final tie at Gloucester next month after the Rugby Football Union found that Wasps' replacement hooker Jonny Barrett had been cup-tied. Barrett came on 12 minutes from the end of normal time when his side were trailing by three points but he had already appeared in the competition for Henley in an earlier round when out on loan. Wasps won 43-33 after extra-time. \"We input into out database all the information after a round of the Powergen Cup and found that Jonny Barrett was ineligible to play for Wasps,\" said the RFU's operations' director Terry Burwell. \"The rules are specific: a player may appear for only one club in the tournament during a season and expulsion for a side in breach is automatic. It is unfortunate to lose a team of the calibre of Wasps in this way but North Walsham were expelled earlier in the season for fielding a cup-tied player during their victory at Stourbridge and we have to be consistent. Wasps have acted honourably by accepting the decision and not appealing but the message is clear for all Premiership clubs who send players out on loan: insist they do not play in the Powergen Cup to avoid mistakes like last Sunday.\" \"We admit our mistake and at a busy time of the year a quick decision was in everyone's interests,\" said the Wasps chief executive David Davies. \"By not appealing we are allowing Gloucester and Bristol time to make the arrangements for their quarter-final.\" \"Mistakes happen,\" said Burwell. \"I suspect there will be a number of volunteers at junior clubs all over the country smiling to themselves that a professional club has fallen foul of the regulations but this episode shows that the RFU will detect breaches of the rules and apply sanctions in an even-handed manner. \"I rang Warren Gatland [Wasps' director of rugby] and said it was a horrible way to go out of the competition,\" said Bristol's head coach Richard Hill. \"I just wanted to tell him it had nothing to do with us, it was just one of those nightmare administrative errors we all dread. Wasps have our sympathy and we owe it to them to make a decent fist of it at Kingsholm.\" Wasps will lose around \u00a310,000 from the gate at Gloucester but they have big games next month against Calvisano and Biarritz in Europe and Bath at home. In Wales the Newport-Gwent Dragons yesterday ended their season-long feud with the Welsh Rugby Union and signed the regional participation agreement. The Dragons had held out because they were paid \u00a3200,000 a year less than the Neath-Swansea Ospreys."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
