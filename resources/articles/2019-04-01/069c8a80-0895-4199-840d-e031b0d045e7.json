Liverpool lead the champions by two points with six games remaining, albeit with City having a game in hand, after producing another dramatic late winner to defeat Tottenham on Sunday. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team visit Southampton on Friday with a belief they can overcome every test, according to Man\u00e9, who says the leaders require a flawless finish to the campaign to hold off Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. The Senegal striker said: \u201cThat [belief] is what makes you more motivated and makes everyone say: \u2018Let\u2019s go, we can do it\u2019, so I think it\u2019s important. This is a very, very good sign and I think everything is possible, so let\u2019s do it and win it. To be honest I think we need to win all of the games, even if it will not be easy. We still can win every game because we are a good team and we play very well.\u201d Man\u00e9 admits Liverpool must improve on their second-half display against Spurs to maintain pressure on City. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s difficult after the international break because we only had two or three sessions together. Now we are back and we start with a win, I think it\u2019s very important. We have three or four more days to train together so be like before and go again.\u201d Andy Robertson, meanwhile, believes the defeat of Spurs demonstrated the heart and attitude that has propelled Liverpool throughout the title race and will push them on for the final games of the campaign. Liverpool replaced Manchester City at the top of the table on Sunday courtesy of Toby Alderweireld\u2019s late own goal at Anfield. It was the third time this season that Klopp\u2019s team have claimed victory in the 90th minute \u2013more than any other Premier League side \u2013 and cleared arguably their toughest remaining assignment in pursuit of a first league title since 1990. Robertson admitted that luck was on Liverpool\u2019s side against Spurs, who were the stronger team in the second half at Anfield. But he says the leaders\u2019 habit of winning late is evidence of the indefatigable spirit within Klopp\u2019s squad and no fluke. The Liverpool left-back, once again outstanding on Sunday, said: \u201cI think it comes from the whole squad having the right attitude and belief that we are good enough to win any game. We knew Tottenham were playing well in the second half but we still believed we were better and could go on and win the game. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got the energy and we know we\u2019ve got the heart to go right until the end in every single game. Our fitness levels are the best they should be at this point of the season so we know we can go right to the end. But sometimes you just need that wee bit of luck and we got it. \u201cEven when we were going through the tough times in the second half, we still believed we were going to win the game and that\u2019s the mentality we have. It maybe didn\u2019t look likely at times but three points and looking at the league table is all that matters. Performances don\u2019t really matter at this point of the season as long as we win.\u201d Klopp admitted the manner of Liverpool\u2019s dramatic victory on Sunday would have a greater impact on his players than a 5-0 stroll, and Robertson said: \u201cOf course we\u2019re all buzzing but only time will tell if it can give us that. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re lacking a spark but it can give us a real good push right to the end of this season now for six games. But we need to keep going like that and we need to play better than we probably did, especially in the second half.\u201d Robertson\u2019s peach of a cross for Roberto Firmino\u2019s opening goal was his ninth assist of the Premier League season, the most by any Liverpool defender this term. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice feeling,\u201d the Scotland captain said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t enjoy that until the end of the season because I want nine to become 10, 10 to become 11, and that\u2019s the attitude I want to keep producing and hopefully get more assists and maybe pitch in with a goal or two \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t look likely! I\u2019m just happy to help create goals or score goals and this season I\u2019ve put in some good crosses and the quality has been there but I just need more and six games to go hopefully I can get a couple more.\u201d Virgil van Dijk, meanwhile, is expected to be fit to face former club Southampton at St Mary\u2019s Stadium on Friday. The influential defender hurt his ankle when defending Moussa Sissoko\u2019s late charge at Anfield and required an ice pack after the game. He is not believed to have suffered serious damage, however, and should be back in training before the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
