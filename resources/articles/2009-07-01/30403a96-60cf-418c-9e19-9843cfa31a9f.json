Remember that bit where Gary Cooper is desperately scouting round town, imploring the men to fight with him against the bandits who are on their way, but they're all too chicken and won't look him in the eye? Here in The Street (BBC1), Bob Hoskins paces around his little corner of Manchester, trying to get the guys to stand with him against Miller, the local gangster and bully played by Liam Cunningham. (Miller! It was Miller in High Noon, too, I think I'm on to something here.) Gary Cooper tried the Sunday church service, Bob Hoskins tries the pub football team, both without success. It's easier not to look someone in the eye these days; you can just put your mobile phone on voicemail. So Hoskins, too, is left to face the bad dude on his own, to wait as the clock ticks down, not until the arrival of the noon stream train but to the 3 o'clock kick-off of the televised match at the Greyhound. Liam Cunningham has said he'll bring his son who Hoskins banned for smoking in the toilet, and if he doesn't serve them, he'll get a battering. The cowards who normally pack the pub for the game stay away. The clock ticks down, the time comes, Cunningham and his son head for the pub, just like High Noon. Miller and one of his shooters stroll down the middle of the empty street while the curtains twitch on either side. The only difference is that the Greyhound doesn't have swinging saloon doors \u2013 this is Manchester, it's too cold for them. A pint of bitter and a pint of lager for the boy, says Cunningham. But Hoskins stands tall \u2013 well, as tall as Hoskins can, which isn't very, to be honest. He can't serve the boy, he says, he's banned. For which he gets his battering, and very unpleasant it is, too \u2013 he's straight off to A&amp;E. But he's out of hospital in time to open the pub up that same evening. He humiliates Cunningham and his boy in front of everyone, because now the pub is full. And then he sends everyone else home too; it's the moment Gary Cooper pulls off his sheriff's badge and throws it into the dust: thanks for nothing. Oh, and there's just time to give Tommy the drunk a little lecture about drinking before closing up. The performance by Hoskins is very fine. And by Cunningham, too. By everyone, in fact, and everything \u2013 even the pile driver that bangs away in the street, adding to the feeling of tension and impending doom, hammering the message home. Clang, this is serious drama, written by Jimmy McGovern . . . Clang, the subject matter will be the British working classes and there will be messages about morality . . . Clang, fine actors will queue up to deliver fine performances . . . Clang, get your Baftas ready . . . Clang, the misery will be relentless . . . That's not meant as a complaint, The Street is serious, proper drama. OK, so I suppose I wouldn't mind some respite from the grit and grime, the odd moment of tenderness, a laugh even, a Butch-and-Sundance moment. Obviously I've never met anyone from the working classes, but I can't believe they don't occasionally find something to smile about, even for just a moment. No? Oh well. Ah, here's some respite: Monday Monday (ITV1), a new comedy drama. I do love a comedy drama. The head office of a supermarket chain has moved from London to Leeds, which gives some of the characters the chance to leave messy lives behind and start again. We're talking the office environment as a source of comedy here. So the head of HR is a hopeless alcoholic. The boss is a bumbling fool. A new hotshot manager is parachuted in, complete with tarty bimbo secretary, whose job description includes sleeping with hotshot manager boss . . . No, you're the sexist, for thinking that she's a he, and he's a she. Unless you saw it, of course, in which case you're an idiot for not switching over to The Street. Because Monday Monday is hopeless \u2013 lame and laboured, tired and predictable, it's as if The Office never happened. It's my fault, I'm the idiot, for wanting respite from the misery. Come back Jimmy McGovern, banging home the messages with your big pile driver, all is forgiven."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
