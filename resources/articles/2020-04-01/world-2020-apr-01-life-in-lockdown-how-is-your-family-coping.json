Please keep sending us video and information about how you\u2019re experiencing any aspect of the coronavirus crisis: it\u2019s essential to how we are portraying the condition of the country. The next film will focus on family life during the crisis \u2013 the issues, pressures, problems (and comforts) people are experiencing as they live through this time alongside their nearest and dearest. We\u2019re asking for video footage, as well as any information about people, places and issues we should cover. How does everyday family life work in the absence of school? What\u2019s it like self-isolating with your parents, or grandparents? How do a range of things, from special educational needs to visiting rights, work in these strange times? Are you separated from close family members, and how do you keep in touch? How are teenagers coping? And what of play, leisure, and time out from each other\u2019s company? How to shoot video If you fancy sending some video, please shoot landscape rather than portrait. And it\u2019s hugely important that you observe the physical distancing rules. Record a video diary of what\u2019s happening to you, but also turn your phone or camera the other way round, and give us a sense of your immediate surroundings and what\u2019s happening in them. Any flavour of people\u2019s family lives is great: what you\u2019re having to do, things that are now challenging, how your domestic life has been transformed. If you can send us video, you can email it or use a transfer service, such as WeTransfer. If there are things we should know about, for this or future episodes, send us an email. Thanks again for everyone\u2019s work and help. We\u2019re thrilled that the idea is working.
