Mr Straw yesterday made plain he was prepared to see prison numbers rise to tackle the hardcore of persistent criminals who, he claimed, were responsible for nearly half of all crime. He said there might come a time when fewer prison places were needed \"but that is a long way off\". Within hours the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, marking the 10th anniversary of the day he handed his influential report on prison reform to the then home secretary, described jail overcrowding as the \"Aids virus of the prison system\" and called on courts to pass shorter sentences. He said: \"The judiciary must play their part in reducing the use of custody to what is the acceptable and appropriate minimum. When a custodial sentence is necessary the shortest sentence should be imposed. \"Frequently one month will achieve everything that can be achieved by three months and three months will achieve everything that can be by six months and so on.\" Lord Woolf made clear last night in his Prison Reform Trust lecture that the best way of cutting crime was a higher detection rate rather than an increase in the prison population of 62,000, which is already forecast to rise to more than 78,000 by 2007. \"What has to be realised, and I include the government here, is that a short custodial sentence is a very poor alternative to a sentence to be served in the community. It is far more expensive. It will do nothing to tackle the offender's behavioural problems. It should be regarded as being no more than a necessary evil whose primary purpose is to obtain compliance with court orders.\" His views were in sharp contrast to those of Mr Straw, who declared that community penalties did nothing for 80% of the 100,000 hardcore of the most persistent offenders. \"Almost without exception, every persistent offender sentenced to custody has been through the mill of community sentences and has still reoffended,\" Mr Straw said in a lecture to the Social Market Foundation. \"If we are to get on top of this problem of persistent criminality and are to process more through the system prison numbers may well have to rise. We have factored that into our spending plans. In time, and it will take time, once the system has got on top of this problem, then there may be a need for fewer places, but that is a long way off.\" Mr Straw's decision to target the \"100,000 most persistent offenders\" is one of the first fruits of work by the former BBC director general, Lord Birt, as the home secretary's special adviser on crime. Initial findings of Home Office research commissioned by Lord Birt suggest that this hardcore accounts for about 10% of all active criminals and yet has a much greater impact on the crime rate than was previously thought. \"Half are under 21. Nearly two-thirds are hard drug users. More than a third were in care as children. Half have no qualifications at all. And three quarters have no work and little or no legal income,\" Mr Straw said. He added that although they were convicted again and again by the courts there was little appreciable increase in the length of sentence they received each time. Tony Blair told the cabinet this week that the \"war on crime\" would be a central part of Labour's election manifesto and at the heart of it would be a radical reform of sentencing to ensure that the persistent offenders received longer sentences each time they were convicted by the courts. Mr Straw said he wanted to end the \"just deserts\" philosophy contained in the 1991 Criminal Justice Act - the piece of legislation that had incorporated most of the reforms Lord Woolf recom mended in his report. The 1991 act had ensured that the courts did not hand out prison sentences out of all proportion to the crime, and contained a \"milk bottle clause\" which was quietly dropped. This ensured that a judge did not sentence a thief to six months in prison for stealing a bottle of milk even if it was the 12th time he had been convicted of the offence. Mr Straw said yesterday it was time to make the sentence fit the offender rather than the offence. He acknowledged that the clause in question had been dropped, but said the courts still sentenced within its spirit and few persistent offenders got longer sentences every time they appeared in court."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
