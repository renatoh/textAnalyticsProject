The Freiburg-based Ensemble Recherche were giving the work its UK premiere, along with Murmurs, by Britain's Rebecca Saunders, composer in residence at this year's festival. The concert was a quiet affair, somewhat inevitably, as both pieces privilege the contemplative and static over the assertive and dynamic. Schnee (meaning snow) explores the idea that our perception of nearly identical patterns causes the imagination to project new forms by itself. Along with the piano, the paper and some other instruments, there's a gong that resonates passively. It is struck only once, effectively holding a kind of mirror up to the whole work. The listener's awareness fluctuates between following all the intricate processes and letting them go \u2013 and slipping into a pleasurable trance which, I suspect, only fails to overtake the performers because of their need to count frantically for an hour. The processes in Murmurs are more elusive still, with individual performers exploring fragmentary material, sometimes finding dialogue, more often not. Some help for the listener is afforded by the programme, which contains a passage by Jacques Derrida about language and erasure; this sounds pretentious but isn't, although you need to be in the mood \u2013 and if you aren't, you're probably at the wrong festival. In a separate concert, cellist Jakob Kullberg and violinist Chouchane Siranossian gave a beautiful performance of Telara\u00f1as (Spanish for cobwebs), a new work by Simon Holt. Although the music was more orthodox, Holt shares Abrahamsen's interest in the intricate patterns found in nature. The piece makes much of the timbral overlap between cello and violin, and relates to a wider \"web\" of chamber pieces. I, for one, can't wait for their completion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
