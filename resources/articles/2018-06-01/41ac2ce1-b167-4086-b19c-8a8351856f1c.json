It wants to split its infrastructure assets into a new wholly owned business unit in preparation for a potential demerger, or the entry of a strategic investor, in a post-national broadband network rollout world. The new business unit will be called Telstra InfraCo. The company says it will abolish one in four executive and middle management roles to flatten its structure. Andrew Penn, Telstra\u2019s chief executive, says customers will start to benefit from its new plans as quickly as July when the company launches \u201cpeace of mind data\u201d across a range of new post-paid plans, making excess data charges a thing of the past. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The stock market was informed of Telstra\u2019s plans on Wednesday morning and its share price fell 7% in early trade. It has recovered dslightly but is still down 5.5% at $2.75. Telstra has roughly 32,000 employees so the plan could affect one quarter of its workforce. Penn said he understood the plan would affect thousands of staff but Telstra needed to remain an industry leader. About $50m will be set aside for a transition program for affected staff. \u201cThe rate and pace of change in our industry is increasingly driven by technological innovation and competition,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this environment traditional companies that do not respond are most at risk. We have worked hard preparing Telstra for this market dynamic while ensuring we did not act precipitously. \u201cHowever, we are now at a tipping point where we must act more boldly if we are to continue to be the nation\u2019s leading telecommunications company. \u201cIn the future our workforce will be a smaller, knowledge-based one with a structure and way of working that is agile enough to deal with rapid change. \u201cWe understand the impact this will have on our employees and once we make decisions on specific changes, we are committed to talking to impacted staff first and ensuring we support them through this period.\u201d The Communications Workers Union reacted angrily to the announcement, accusing Penn of putting short-term profits above long-term services for the community. \u201cTelstra\u2019s decision to slash 8,000 job will devastate thousands of Australian families and have a significant impact on Telstra\u2019s ability to deliver for consumers,\u201d the union\u2019s national president, Shane Murphy, said. \u201cToday\u2019s jobs purge is the low-point of 20 years of privatisation, which has consistently taken the low road of cutting jobs rather than investing in vital community infrastructure. \u201cThis is a recipe for reduced services, with Telstra\u2019s highly skilled workforce of employees and contractors replaced by casuals and piece-workers.\u201d The union is currently bargaining for a new enterprise agreement to cover the Telstra workforce. It will meet Telstra executives on Wednesday afternoon. Scott Morrison, the treasurer,has also expressed concern at Telstra\u2019s decision. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed to learn that news,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I can say in response, it\u2019s that the government has been working hard to ensure that the economy they will go back into now, to find another job, [has] more jobs ... today than there were before.\u201d Mitch Fifield, the communications minister, says his thoughts are with Telstra\u2019s staff and he has spoken to Penn about the company\u2019s $50m transition program. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognise that our telecommunications companies operate in a highly competitive environment that is constantly evolving,\u201d Fifield said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to each telco business to make judgements as to the best way to meet the needs of their customers and the best way to satisfy their shareholders. Telstra have determined that this is the program that they will pursue to provide the service that their customers expect.\u201d Telstra has named its strategy Telstra2022, because it is a three-year plan. It includes $2bn of asset sales and 8,000 job losses, and is expected to save $2.5bn annually. Telstra InfraCo will have its own chief executive, reporting to Penn. It will comprise Telstra\u2019s fixed network infrastructure including data centres, non mobiles-related domestic fibre, copper, hybrid fibre-coaxial, international subsea cables, exchanges, poles, ducts and pipes. Its services will be sold to Telstra, wholesale customers and NBN Co. Labor leader Bill Shorten says it is a \u201cvery tough time\u201d for Telstra staff and the company must pay them their entitlements. \u201cEverything that people have earned and deserved has got to be paid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure people aren\u2019t treated as being thrown on the scrapheap, there\u2019s a proper transition.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
