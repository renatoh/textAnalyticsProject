Last week, governments met in New York to draft the outcome document for the third international conference on financing for development (FFD), which will take place in Addis Ababa in mid-July. Negotiations are continuing as governments struggle to agree on key issues such as tax, a critical source of financing for development commitments, human rights and gender equality. The Addis Ababa conference is of crucial importance to women. Decisions made in the Ethiopian capital will determine how the SDGs will be financed. Although no specific costing for achieving gender equality and women\u2019s rights within the context of the SDGs has yet been calculated, in the case of the millennium development goals (MDGs), which expire this year, the gender equality financing gap in low income countries was projected at $83bn (\u00a353bn) in 2015. Because the new development agenda is universal \u2013 and far more ambitious than the MDGs \u2013 the costs are likely to be even greater. Yet it is not only the quantity of funds that matters but how funds are raised and who receives them. As women and men occupy different roles in society, different sources of money affect them differently. Across the world, women carry out at least twice as much unpaid care work as men, and this contribution is often invisible and unrecognised. At work, women are worse off too. According to recent research by ActionAid, if women were paid as much as men and had the same access to jobs, they could be $17tn better off. Governments need to value women and their unpaid work when thinking about economic policy. The FFD process can and should address major structural issues such as tax dodging, which deprives developing countries of far more than they receive in aid. Lack of revenue forces governments to spend less on essential public services. This can have a disproportionate effect on women in poverty if, for example, you consider childcare or support for survivors of gender-based violence \u2013 both services that are used mainly by women. Governments should take the opportunity offered by the Addis meeting to accelerate progress on global tax reform that works for developing countries. Aid will continue to be a critical source of finance for the SDGs, especially for the least developed countries, but the share of aid supporting women\u2019s needs is still too low. According to OECD GenderNet, in 2012-13 only 5% of aid had gender equality as a \u201cprincipal\u201d objective. Governments must recommit to meet the long-standing target of devoting 0.7% of GDP to aid, and increase the share of aid dedicated to gender equality, while investing more in supporting the crucial work done by women\u2019s rights organisations on the ground. To date, huge emphasis has been placed on the role of the private sector in financing development, especially multinational companies. While the private sector has a role to play in creating decent jobs and ensuring equal pay for women, the footprint of many companies has been harmful to women\u2019s rights at work. We need to move away from voluntary corporate social responsibility commitments towards a legally binding regulation to make sure companies are accountable. If businesses did this, and paid their taxes in full, it would send a strong signal that the private sector is serious about supporting sustainable development, gender equality and women\u2019s rights. The current draft of the Addis Ababa Accord starts well by stating a commitment towards gender equality and women\u2019s rights, but falls short on staying true to this vision throughout. Lack of recognition of the structural causes of gender inequality, such as the disproportionate responsibility of unpaid care borne by women and girls, means it risks focusing only on what women can do for the economy rather than on how the economy must work in a way that supports rights for all. As governments continue their discussions, they must reach a consensus on financing methods that can really make a difference for gender equality and women\u2019s rights for years to come. The vision for change is clear \u2013 now the money must follow.
