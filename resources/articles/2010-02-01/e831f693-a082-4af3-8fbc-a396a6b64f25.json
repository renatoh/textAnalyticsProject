Officers named Anthony Marsh, who has not been seen since yesterday morning, as a murder suspect in the deaths of Stephanie Bellinger, 24, and her daughter Lily. They were found dead by a relative who visited their home in Totton, near Southampton, yesterday. Bellinger's two-year-old son was found unharmed. Describing Marsh as \"dangerous\", a police spokesman said detectives wanted to speak to him as a \"matter of urgency\". Tonight it was revealed that a post-mortem had found Stephanie died of multiple stab wounds; a post-mortem will be carried out on Lily's body tomorrow. Wendy Marsh collapsed in tears at Southampton central police station as she tried to read out a statement addressed to her son, and was unable to continue. Detective Constable John Woodward addressed Marsh on behalf of his mother, saying: \"Anthony, if you are watching, or if you read or hear this, please understand that all your family are very concerned about you. They are here to support you in any way they can. It is pointless to run away or hide. \"Whatever has happened, you must now hand yourself into the police or phone them and tell them where you are. Please Anthony, for the sake of all the family.\" Marsh is known to have gone missing before, and to have visited Brighton and Portsmouth to the east and Weymouth, Plymouth and Bristol in the west. Police said they \"remain open as to his exact whereabouts\". He is described as white, 6ft 2ins, with short fair hair, brown eyes, of slim build and has a tattoo on his left forearm. He is known to travel by rail and frequently sleeps rough or in churches, police say. \"Mr Marsh is dangerous and should not be approached,\" the police said. Describing the case as a \"tragedy\" for the family, Detective Chief Inspector Colin Mathews warned the public that Marsh may be carrying a knife. Mathews added: \"Mr Marsh has also been known to take long walks within the New Forest national park and had a favourite spot he liked to visit. It is between Lyndhurst and Bournemouth and known locally as the Devil's Dyke near Burley. \"If you are a dog walker, a horse rider or someone else who has visited the New Forest during the past two days, have you seen someone matching Mr Marsh's description?\" Neighbours said they heard shouting coming from the semi-detached house on Friday but presumed it was rowdy teenagers playing in a nearby park. Leanne Rowe, 25, said: \"There was some noise about 8.30pm, a lot of shouting and then we heard a car driving up.\" A year and a half ago, Marsh, a former customer relations adviser for British Gas, sparked a police hunt after vanishing from the family home, according to the local paper, the Southern Daily Echo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
