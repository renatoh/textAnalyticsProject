Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, said all pupils at school would have to continue to study maths as part of Labour\u2019s proposals, including an estimated 250,000 each year who pass GCSE maths with a C grade or higher but did not go on study maths at A-level. Currently, only those who failed maths at GCSE or equivalent levels have to continue studying the subject after the age of 16 in order to resit the examinations, which Hunt criticised as \u201ca staggering degree of complacency\u201d. Recent research by the OECD found that a quarter of adults in England have the maths skills of a 10-year-old, meaning they are only able to manage one-step mathematical tasks such as sorting numbers or reading graphs. \u201cOur future success as a nation depends on all young people taking maths to 18, so we set the next generation up to succeed in life and work and deliver the skills employers are demanding,\u201d Hunt said, appearing at an event at Bletchley Park\u2019s national museum of computing alongside Marcus du Sautoy, the professor of mathematics at Oxford University known for his BBC television series popularising maths, including The Code. \u201cIt is essential that everyone is mathematically literate in this scientific age. That\u2019s why ensuring all young people study maths to 18 is so important,\u201d said du Sautoy, who also holds Oxford\u2019s Simonyi chair in the public understanding of science. \u201cWithout the language of maths you are disenfranchised from making critical decisions about risk, the direction of the economy, the future of climate and energy resources and so much more. It doesn\u2019t matter what you end up studying, a sustained mathematical education helps build a logical and analytical approach to solving whatever problem you are wrestling with.\u201d The move was given public support by Mike Ellicock, chief executive of National Numeracy, the charity formed to tackle poor maths skills in the UK. \u201cWe really need to challenge negative attitudes that assume that maths is a \u2018can do\u2019 or \u2018can\u2019t do\u2019 subject. It is not. Everyone can \u2013 with effort and persistence \u2013 learn the maths they need for everyday life and work. And it is vital that we all become numerate; international research from the OECD has shown that good numeracy is the best protection against unemployment, low wages and poor health,\u201d Ellicock said. Only about 20% of young people in England continue to study maths after taking GCSEs, compared with 90% of pupils in Germany and Hong Kong who continue after the age of 16. Similar moves are supported by the CBI and Royal Society, while compulsory post-16 maths was also recommended by a Carol Vorderman-led maths task force commissioned by David Cameron in 2011. Critics including the National Union of Teachers say that schools are already struggling to find qualified maths teachers, and Labour\u2019s policy would need to overcome the shortage to be effective."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
