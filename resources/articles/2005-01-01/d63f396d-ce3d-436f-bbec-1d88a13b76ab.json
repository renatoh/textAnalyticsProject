It's not just a case of having dazzling policies but of the public being fed up enough with the party in power to listen to your wonderful alternative. For the Conservatives, yesterday's labour market figures could hardly have been worse - a record number of people in work, a fall in those claiming benefit, a chunky rise in average earnings. All a far cry from the days of \"Labour isn't working\" in 1979, as ministers will not tire of telling us between now and the election. Give the Tories some credit: they sought to make the best of a bad hand by focusing on the fact that there are more than 1.1 million people under 25 who are not in work, full-time education or training. Number crunching by David Willetts showed that as a percentage of those unemployed, those under 25 make up 42.7% of the total compared with 32.8% in 1997. His conclusion - that the government's New Deal is a waste of money and should be scrapped - happily chimed with Oliver Letwin's message earlier in the week that there was money to be saved from a bit of ruthless pruning around Whitehall. At this stage of the electoral cycle, however, what counts is not the neatness of your argument but whether you can market it successfully to the public. Here, the Conservatives face two big problems. The first is that saying many of those who were placed in jobs by the New Deal would have found work anyway draws attention to the fact that demand for labour is strong. The second is that it allows ministers to contrast the two million people added to the workforce since 1997 with the two bouts of mass unemployment between 1979 and 1997. Powered up As heftier gas and electricity bills land on doormats, the impact of rising energy costs is already feeding through into the rate of inflation. Nothing immediately to set the alarm bells ringing as far as the Bank of England is concerned, though it may now be slower to call the peak of the interest rate cycle. But after a rash of increases from the utility companies early last year and then again in the autumn, what is the outlook for the coming 12 months? The answer is hardly comforting. Anyone expecting the power companies to suddenly push the price spiral into reverse is likely to be disappointed. Sentiment has been changed by the realisation that Britain's self-sufficiency in gas - courtesy of the North Sea - is over. That means greater winter depen dency on imports from Europe, where pricing is still closely tied to that of oil. Security of supply will remain an issue overhanging the wholesale gas market, source of much of the UK's energy, until planned new pipelines and increased storage facilities - not always popular with those who have to live next door - are in operation. Further on there is a need for additional spending on infrastructure for both generation and distribution to replace plant and equipment - some of which dates back to just after the second world war. The government is going to need a joined-up energy policy to replace North Sea self-sufficiency. The regulator may be forced to consider allowing utilities to sign up for longer term contracts to avoid spot-market volatility. But it will all have to be paid for and we know who will foot the bill. For most of us, there is still plenty of scope to limit the damage by shopping around. But those facing fuel poverty are going to need increasing help. Look at the books This is a make or break year for Marjorie Scardino and Pearson. For any company involved in the US education business, 2005 is going to be a big one, but more so for Pearson than probably any other. For this year will decide whether the media and education business Ms Scardino has fashioned from the disparate group she took over in 1997 really can deliver. Investors are growing weary of excuses for poor performance at Penguin - ranging in the past few months from warehousing mistakes to US elections to the American mass market in general. And although the \u00a332m loss made by the FT last year really does seem to be part of the past, several still question why a company which makes most of its money from the American education sector continues to own a global financial newspaper. Complaints are hardly flooding in but the drip, drip, drip of profit downgrades over the past year has added to the sense of time running out. So all eyes will be on the group's education business this year. The so-called adoption opportunity in the US, which dictates the number of schools ordering textbooks, will rise by 80% to $900m (\u00a3481m) with large states such as Texas opening their chequebooks. Pearson itself is upbeat about its prospects. The brightest spark in the group's lacklustre trading statement yesterday was its forecast of a \"significant acceleration\" in its finances this year because of the number of books it intends to sell to American pupils. If it does not, the media and education business, which once owned a waxworks and an investment bank, will face further calls for change, whether Ms Scardino agrees or not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
