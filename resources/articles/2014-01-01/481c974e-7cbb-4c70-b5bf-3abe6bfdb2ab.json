Australian batting coach Michael di Venuto was full of praise for Rogers, who he feels provides a decent template for others around him to bat tough when the runs aren\u2019t flowing freely. Di Venuto told Cricinfo\u2019s Dan Brettig: \u201cWhat Chris does, and what he has done his whole career, is that no matter what sort of form he is in he scores runs. That is the name of the game \u2026 There is no point scoring runs only when you are in top form and nothing when you\u2019re not hitting them that well.\u201d Rogers rarely looks like he\u2019s hitting them particularly well, but the stats don\u2019t lie. Di Venuto\u2019s pupils might not have always fired this summer, but England\u2019s batting coach Graham Gooch has far fewer positives to muse on at team breakfasts. Mike Selvey says he might have lost the ear of his players. Gooch has forgotten more about batting than most would ever know, so that is a great shame. Australia\u2019s ODI squad \u2013 the comings and goings Such is the state of contentment within Australian cricket these past few weeks, the only real teeth-gnashing after the announcement of Australia\u2019s 14-man squad for the upcoming one-day internationals would have come from the unlucky players who missed out. There was no spot for the in-form Cameron White, who couldn\u2019t dislodge any of the incumbent batsman after his player-of-the-series efforts in the Ryobi Cup. The perennially unlucky Adam Voges makes way for a fit-again Shaun Marsh, while Moises Henriques and Callum Ferguson were omitted from the squad that toured India. Phil Hughes must have broken a mirror at some point and must also bide his time for now. The main point of interest with respect to Australia\u2019s upcoming tour of South Africa will be the performances of James Pattinson, who returns for his first international action since September last year. If fit and firing, he suddenly becomes the handiest of back-up options for Johnson, Harris and Siddle. The Crock Show As is traditionally the case each summer, Nine\u2019s The Cricket Show allotted its standard six minutes of airtime to the women\u2019s game in the form of a discussion between hosts Michael Slater and Michael Vaughan, along with Southern Stars players Ellyse Perry and Meg Lanning. What followed was the nadir of a program that once actually offered something useful under the stewardship of Simon O\u2019Donnell, but now seems to exist solely to cross-promote Nine\u2019s commercial interests and provide a vehicle for its commentary team to talk about themselves a bit more. Based on this season\u2019s dross, they\u2019d be better off bringing back the 18 foot skiffs to fill the lunch break. If you can\u2019t watch the clip, this is a run-down of how that precious airtime to promote the women\u2019s game was spent: 0min 00sec Michael Slater starts in style: \u201cHello ladies, you\u2019re looking fantastic as always.\u201d So far, so bad. 30sec Attention turned to the men\u2019s team, which has clearly been starved of attention. 1min 00sec After 30 seconds of Perry talking about the women\u2019s game, Slats turns attention back to the men\u2019s team, obviously. 1min 20sec Finally Lanning gets some airtime before Michael Vaughan brings up the pressing matter of, you guessed it, the men\u2019s team. 1min 40sec Slats engages in some paternalistic nonsense, asking Perry \u201chow does your body get through the number of overs that you put into it?\u201d Wrong gender, Slats. It\u2019s the male bowlers that normally break down. Though to be fair, when Perry is injured she does just keep bowling until her team wins. Remember that? 2min 30sec Slats makes a joke, and I use that term loosely, that he \u201ckick-started\u201d Perry\u2019s career by \u201cletting her get me out\u201d in a charity match. This bon mot is followed by a similarly condescending statement about the improving skill levels of women\u2019s cricketers, as though they\u2019d previously been a bunch of rag-tag club cricketers. 3min 00sec Vaughan gets straight back to the important business of the men\u2019s team. I think he wants to marry the men\u2019s team, actually. 4min 30sec Slats launches a witless, unnecessary segue into modeling shots of Lanning and Perry, both of whom look like they want to either die or strangle Slats. In that respect they\u2019re like any viewer of The Cricket Show. Can this get any worse? 4min 45sec Oh yes, it can get much worse. \u201cI certainly never feel overly comfortable with it,\u201d says Perry with little subtlety as footage of her swimwear photo shoot continues to roll. \u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed,\u201d counters Slats creepily. By this point the entire nation is throwing any available objects at their TV screen. 5min 10sec In an appropriate end to this serious discussion of women\u2019s cricket, we get near-on a minute of Michael Vaughan\u2019s appearances on Strictly Come Dancing. Hats off guys, really. Around the grounds The Big Bash League is off and running for 2013-14 and what a glut of scoring we have seen so far. Totals in excess of 200 have been rare in the tournament\u2019s short history, with only one come from the first two installments. So far BBL03 has yielded four, two of them coming from the buoyant Melbourne Stars. They belted the Renegades for 208 in game one thanks to Luke Wright and Cameron White, and the hapless Sixers for an even 200 a week later thanks to the finishing work of David Hussey and Glenn Maxwell. Not weighed down by any of the three main threats to BBL success (missing internationals, underperforming imports, harboring too many grade cricketers), the Stars look a formidable side and as close to a finals lock as we\u2019ve seen this season. Elsewhere, the Adelaide Strikers have proven that low-key doesn\u2019t necessarily mean low-intensity, accounting for both the Thunder and the Scorchers with minimal fuss. Michael Klinger, English import Alex Hales and the returning ghost of Shaun Tait have been their most eye-catching performers so far. At the other end of the scale, surely there needs to be an Argus Report-style inquest into the shambles that has been the Sydney Thunder over the past 12 months? Winless after three games, not even Mike Hussey has been able to pull them to the heights of mediocrity, try as he might. Against the Sixers they were 121-1 after 12.4 overs and finished with 166. With four wickets in hand. If someone can explain that one I\u2019m all ears. The Sydney Thunder would lose to the 1998-99 Canberra Comets. Vic Marks thinks that the Big Bash could end up providing a decent platform for some of England\u2019s one-day international squad to launch into the upcoming round of internationals and he\u2019s probably right. It\u2019s also enabled Ten\u2019s impressive audiences for the first free-to-air Big Bash series to preview some of Australia\u2019s opposition in the ODIs. Jos Buttler, Luke Wright and Alex Hales have tuned up with some big-hitting and Ravi Bopara, Michael Lumb and Eoin Morgan have had more modest returns. Some think Morgan unlucky not to be in or around the Test setup. At the very least we\u2019ll get a good look at him this summer. Player of the Week Mitch Johnson might have claimed his third player-of-the-match nod in four Tests, but if it had been thrown to a viewer verdict, we\u2019re pretty sure that Rogers would have extended his moment in the spotlight. Tweet of the Week One of the best meets one of the worst with predictable results Weekend Warriors In the absence of club cricket over the Christmas break, attention was drawn to this fabulous restoration of Sir Donald Bradman\u2019s childhood home in Bowral by the owner\u2019s Twitter account, which publishes an array of Bradman-related photographs and information. Purchased by the present owners in 2008, 52 Sheppard Street, Bowral, is now a NSW National Heritage Trust Awards winner thanks to the meticulous work of architect Ian Stapleton in returning it to the period in which a young Bradman famously honed his skills against a water tank with the unconventional training aid of stump and golf ball."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
