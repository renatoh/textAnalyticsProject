The $5m lawsuit has been filed against Pacquiao and his management team over allegations they knew about the fighter\u2019s shoulder injury before the fight in Las Vegas but failed to report it to the Nevada Athletic Commission, something that is required by law. Pacquiao will undergo surgery on the injury and is expected to be out of action for up to a year. \u201cDefendants prior to and at the time the plaintiffs and the class decided to purchase tickets; purchase pay per view showings or wagered on the event the defendants knew and had full knowledge and information that defendant Pacquiao had been seriously injured and was suffering from a torn rotator cuff,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cDefendants further know that such injury would severely affect his performance.\u201d The Las Vegas residents who filed the lawsuit will presumably argue that they were misled over the bout as one of the fighters was not at peak fitness. The fight is estimated to have generated over $350m. Three million customers in America alone paid $100 to watch the fight on pay-per-view. \u201cThe allegations in this lawsuit are demonstrably false,\u201d said attorney Daniel Petrocelli, who represents Top Rank, Pacquiao\u2019s management company. \u201cThere are documents that explicitly show the medications that Manny was using to treat his shoulder and it was fully disclosed with Usada, which we contracted for this fight.\u201d \u201cAthletes always fight hurt,\u201d promoter Bob Arum said on the night of the fight. \u201cWe felt the work that was done on the shoulder during training would give him the opportunity to use the right hand. He deals with the injury and thinks he conquered it and it was reinjured again. Happens in football and every sport.\u201d The Nevada Athletic Commission, however, has already said it is not happy with how Pacquiao\u2019s team dealt with the injury. \u201cThe first I heard of this was at 6:08pm when he [Pacquiao] arrived in the locker room,\u201d the commission chairman, Francisco Aguilar, said. \u201cI have no proof of the injury. If he told us on Friday, we would have got the MRIs and there are a lot of things we could have done.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday, Mayweather said he would be willing to fight Pacquiao again once the Filipino recovers from surgery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
