The Return to Order campaign, an offshoot of the US Foundation for a Christian Civilization, initially directed its ire at Netflix, calling for the site to \u201cstop promoting evil\u201d and \u201cpull this series at once\u201d. The petition was updated on Thursday to reflect the \u201coversight by Return to Order staff\u201d and acknowledge that the \u201coffensive\u201d series had, in fact, been released by Amazon. \u201cWe regret the mistake, and the protests will be delivered to Amazon when the campaign is complete,\u201d said organisers. The correction did not come in time to prevent both Netflix and Amazon from getting in on the fun. \u201cOk we promise not to make any more,\u201d tweeted Netflix yesterday. \u201cHey @netflix, we\u2019ll cancel Stranger Things if you cancel Good Omens,\u201d tweeted Amazon Prime. More than 20,000 people have put their name to the petition condemning the BBC/Amazon co-production. Starring David Tennant as the devil Crowley and Michael Sheen as the angel Aziraphale as they try to prevent the apocalypse, the show, according to the petition, \u201cpresents devils and Satanists as normal and even good\u201d, \u201cmocks God\u2019s wisdom\u201d, and is \u201canother step to make Satanism appear normal, light and acceptable\u201d. Gaiman remains unbothered. \u201cYou can\u2019t actually make this stuff up ... Bless,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
