One of Britain's most famous and polarising pieces of modern art, My Bed was made in Emin's Waterloo council flat in 1998. Referred to by the artist as an unconventional and uncompromising self-portrait though objects, it features the artist's own bed covered in stained sheets, discarded condoms, blood-stained underwear and empty bottles of alcohol. The Turner-nominated artwork was first purchased by Charles Saatchi in 2000 for just \u00a3150,000. On the market for the first time, My Bed was put up for sale as part of Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art sale, which also included works by Francis Bacon, Peter Doig, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock. Hundreds crammed into the Christie's auction house in St James's in central London, including Emin herself, to watch and take part in the historic sale, with the auction house estimating her work would sell for up to \u00a31.2m. Overseen by auctioneer Jussi Pylkk\u00e4nen, the sale opened at \u00a3650,000 and, as the bids came in thick and fast, the tension in the auction room was palpable until Emin's seminal artwork eventually went for over double the estimate at \u00a32.54m to Jay Jopling, the art dealer and founder of the White Cube gallery. As the winning bid was announced, Emin smiled and applauded. Jopling is a leading figure in the art world and made his name in the 1990s as the main dealer of those in the Young British Artist (YBA) movement such as Damien Hirst, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Emin herself. In 2012 he opened his newest venture in S\u00e3o Paolo with a solo exhibition by Emin. Before the auction, Emin said the selling of the piece felt like \"the end of an era. Saatchi's had this 90s thing in his house like a time capsule. Now it's historical.\" The artist said her hope was that the piece would be bought by a benefactor who would donate it to a museum and keep it on public display. It is unclear what Jopling will do with the artwork. Emin's bed was first shown in Tokyo, where the Japanese customs attempted to destroy it as it arrived in the country, and then in New York. After being nominated for the 1999 Turner prize, and causing a subsequent media frenzy, it caused visitor numbers to Tate Britain to hit a record high and was the piece that put Emin at the heart of the YBAs. Describing her original inspiration for the work, Emin said: \"Well I spent four days in bed. And I was feeling at a very low ebb. And, for two of those four days I was asleep and I didn't wake up. \"It was about the breakup of a relationship with someone I was really in love with. And it was also about my own sort of desperation; it was very romantic in lots of ways. It was almost like a 19th-century bohemian, 'have you ever half-lived?'. \"It's very romantic, what I was feeling was the saddest kind of romanticism that anybody could ever imagine. I could have written a broken-hearted love story at the same time, and I did, with the bed.\" It was the work, she added, that had changed her life: \"I think about the bed almost every day when I make my own bed. I'll always be grateful for the bed. And if I could show the bed in my next show and my next show and my next show, I would. Because I think the bed will forever stand up to time.\" Emin's bed is one of 50 modern artworks and installations being sold by Saatchi this year, as part of a major clearout of his collection. In 2010, Saatchi offered 200 works from his collection, including My Bed, to the nation free of charge if his Chelsea gallery could be given museum status, but the offer was declined. Proceeds from the sale will go to support the Saatchi Gallery's policy of free entry to exhibitions and free education programme for school. Thanks to the Artists Resale Right, which enables artists and their beneficiaries to a royalty from the commercial resale of an original work of art, Emin will also make a small amount from the sale \u2013 around \u00a310,000 \u2013 which is the maximum an artist can receive under the legislation. Other works up for sale at the auction included Roy Lichtenstein's 1971 painting Mirror #8, which went for \u00a31.7m, Andy Warhol's Self Portrait (fright wig) which sold for \u00a35.6m and Francis Bacon's 1967 Study for Head of Lucian Freud, from the Roald Dahl estate, which began bidding at \u00a35m and eventually went for \u00a310.2m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
