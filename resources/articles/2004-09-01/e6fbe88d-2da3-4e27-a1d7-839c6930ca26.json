On average, Britons use up 5.4 hectares of the earth's natural resources every year, well above the global average of 3.4 hectares. According to Earthday, an environmental pressure group, the Earth can only sustain 1.8 hectares per person. So how do you know when you are consuming too much? Earthday has built a web application that calculates your \"global footprint\" from a multiple choice quiz. If you are serious about reducing your global footprint, it is not easy. Redefining Progress, a partner pressure group, recommends ditching the car, going vegetarian and flying a lot less often. www.myfootprint.org www.earthday.net www.rprogress.org Blogged off Blogging may be good for making friends, but is it worth losing your job over? Joyce Park, a former software engineer with the social networking site Friendster, is the latest to fall foul of her employers. She is not the first to get the sack for keeping a blog about her work but, as she points out, her case is \"especially ironic because Friendster, of course, is a company that is all about getting people to reveal information about themselves\". http://troutgirl.com/blog www.friendster.com Kill blog Writer/director Quentin Tarantino has apparently become the latest celebrity to join the legion of bloggers - or has he? It has long been documented that Tarantino is a lousy speller, so this grammatically competent blog has raised the suspicion that it could be a hoax. The \"blogging Tarantino\" has hit back, saying he hires an editor to clean up his stuff, but doubts remain. The site uses Blogger, and the accompanying email address points to a Yahoo account, and both are free and easy to forge. Seasoned Hollywood-watcher JoBlo and MSN have both suggested the blog is a hoax, but you can still enjoy the swipes at Lord of the Rings and gossip about his forthcoming WWII \"spaghetti western\", Inglorious Bastards. The real QT has remained tight-lipped. http://qtdiary.blogspot.com www.joblo.com/index.php?id=5093 Lost in space At the height of the space race, two Italian brothers set up a listening post in the hills above Turin and began probing the heavens for US and Soviet unmanned satellites. One day in early 1961, weeks before Yuri Gagarin's epic space flight, the Judica-Cordiglia brothers were startled by a sound that differed from the usual bleeps of the unmanned satellites they were used to tracking. According to the website Lostcosmonauts.com, the brothers clearly heard \"the beat of a failing heart and the last gasping breaths of a dying cosmonaut\". The incredible story of a failed Soviet mission unfolds on the site, and adds to the archive of unknown Soviet space missions. http://lostcosmonauts.com Word up Wordcount is a stylish \"interactive presentation of the 86,000 most frequently used words in the English language\". Making use of Macromedia's often-maligned Flash to create a refreshingly minimalist interface, the site extracts words from the British National Corpus of Oxford and ranks them in terms of popularity. The site, which you can search by word or word ranking, has attracted something of a cult following that delights in finding interesting sequences. For example, four adjacent words run: America, ensure, oil, opportunity. www.wordcount.org www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk www.number27.org/projects/ Mmmm nice A nice cup of tea and a sit down is a site dedicated to drinking tea, eating biscuits and cakes because \"if you eat biscuits then it's a fair bet you'll have some cake if it's on offer\". This is the work of an anonymous couple who wax lyrical on the idle pleasures of snacktime treats. It is worth a minute of anyone's tea break. www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
