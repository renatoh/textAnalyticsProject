And if the latter is true, is that just to stop themselves going mad? A survey, published last week, found that 42% of millennials \u2013 people reaching young adulthood in the early 21st century \u2013 wouldn\u2019t give up their seat for somebody elderly or pregnant on public transport, while almost one in three would ignore a queuing system. However, more than a third of those surveyed thought it impolite to ignore people on social media, while other objections included texts being read over people\u2019s shoulders and programme spoilers. So, Young People, let\u2019s get this straight (jabs accusing crone-like finger): sitting on a train or bus while a pregnant woman or elderly person stands is absolutely fine. But if someone accidentally mentions what happened in an episode of Stranger Things you haven\u2019t seen, that\u2019s downright rude? Sheesh, priorities\u2026 Not that stereotyping millennials as antisocial and selfish works. That recent cheering surge of last-minute electoral registering was said to mainly come from millennials. Moreover, in the Extinction Rebellion era, older people would have a damn nerve accusing the young of being disengaged. Still, it\u2019s intriguing that there\u2019s a tendency among millennials to prioritise online etiquette over real-life manners. It would seem to reverse what\u2019s generally presumed about online conduct \u2013 aren\u2019t people supposed to feel emboldened to behave worse online? Maybe that\u2019s tragic older types, who still haven\u2019t managed to get over the novelty of the internet\u2019s cloak of invisibility. In contrast, younger people take it so for granted they have developed a far greater sense of accountability for their online identities. Certainly, it\u2019s interesting to think that some younger humans prefer to exist in their most realised form in the online world, even developing better manners there. Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, they\u2019re barging through queues, not opening doors and ambling around semi-detached, almost as though other people are made of pixels in the real world. All of which is mystifying until you take a look at what comprises reality for many young folk. Millennials have plenty to feel disengaged about in a world where they\u2019re been shafted out of real-life futures at every turn (economic, professional, climate, home-ownership, affording to have children, everything). Had all this been our lot when we were young, maybe we\u2019d also have opted to be our better selves, living our best lives, in an online reality. While millennials should realise that they exist in the real, rather than virtual, world, older people need to realise that millennials are becoming dangerously detached from a world that keeps kicking them in the teeth. That said, have a heart, millennials \u2013 let the pregnant women sit down. A mea culpa via social media? Sorry, Timbers, but that\u2019s bad How wonderfully modern that Justin Timberlake took to Instagram to apologise to his wife, Jessica Biel. After being snapped looking inebriated on a balcony, holding hands with his Palmer co-star Alisha Wainwright, Timberlake began his Insta-soz post saying: \u201cI stay away from gossip as much as I can.\u201d Of course you do, you marvellous, honourable man! Timbers continued: \u201cA few weeks ago I displayed a strong lapse of judgment \u2013 but let me clear \u2013 nothing happened with my co-star\u2026 I drank way too much that night and I regret my behaviour\u2026 I apologise to my amazing wife and family\u2026 I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be\u2026\u201d Blah blah, yak yak. The post ends with a reference to Palmer \u2013 because, hey ladeez, nothing says \u201csorry\u201d more meaningfully than a film plug. There\u2019s nothing wrong with an apology, but why did it have to happen on social media? One presumes, as husband and wife, Timberlake and Biel have occasional face-time access to each other (schedules permitting). And aren\u2019t celebrities constantly gassing about media invasions of their privacy? Yet here\u2019s Timberlake invading his own privacy, blasting out an apology to Biel rather strangely in front of the world and humiliating Wainwright (the \u201cco-star\u201d; it would appear that no name is necessary) in the process. I\u2019d love to think that this was Biel\u2019s doing: \u201cOi, you messed up in public \u2013 you can apologise in public too.\u201d Sadly, one suspects that this wasn\u2019t so much an apology as a brand announcement to repair Timberlake\u2019s reputation. So it\u2019s technically more of an apology to his agent and marketing team. Next time Timberlake needs to apologise to his wife, maybe he should consider doing it with a big bunch of flowers and a box of Milk Tray \u2013 even better, some humility and sincerity behind firmly closed doors. Guys, you\u2019ll never win a girl by giving her a Peloton It\u2019s the Christmas gift of a woman\u2019s dreams \u2013 being told that you\u2019re out of shape by your significant other. Peloton, which produces \u00a32,000 exercise bikes that access virtual spin classes, has just wiped $1.5bn off its share value with a misguided festive advert featuring a man giving his partner a bike. Instead of the woman saying something realistic such as: \u201cGet out!\u201d, she has a gratitude orgasm, pedalling furiously and simpering: \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how much this would change me.\u201d Well, some of us didn\u2019t realise that feminism would be pronounced dead in late 2019. Meanwhile, the man sits on the sofa doing faff all, presumably becoming fit by osmosis. However, while this advert was reductive and sexist, the main problem is that a man (even a fictional one) dared to give a woman an exercise bike for Christmas, which is only marginally better timing than Valentine\u2019s Day. Yes, there is an obesity crisis, but no one has the right to comment on anyone else\u2019s fitness. Memo to men: unless requested, gym equipment beats even \u201cunspecified domestic appliance\u201d in the top 10 of dud gifts guaranteed to make a woman hate you. And, yes, I do mean forever. Astonishing as it may seem, women don\u2019t fantasise about being presented with the opportunity to strive to look hotter for you. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
