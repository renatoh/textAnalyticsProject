I was a 15-year-old girl!\u2019 I saw it seven times \u2013 all in its first run at cinemas. What can I say? I was a 15-year-old girl! I cried my heart out every time. I remember sitting in the first row on opening night because it was otherwise completely sold out. Then I watched it again with friends, and again and again I watched it alone. I went to see it so often the local cinema gave me a free ticket to watch the last showing: I just loved the experience. It was a movie so epic, and until then everyone thought they don\u2019t make them like that any more. I haven\u2019t seen it lately but when my daughters are old enough I will try to find a cinema showing. It won\u2019t be the same for them, of course, but it has to be seen and it is truly a movie that belongs on the big screen. Stephi, Austria Bill &amp; Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure \u2013 \u2018Seventeen trips into town for the sheer fun of it\u2019 My friend and I made 17 trips to Leeds city centre to revel in the greatness. Why? The sheer fun of the film, the soundtrack, everything encapsulated who we were at that moment in time. We even managed to collect a fair bit of memorabilia. We went so often that on our last visit we only noticed the rest of the audience\u2019s 3D glasses when the film began. It turned out after 16 viewings in the \u201cmain\u201d screen we had been relegated, and had to highfoot it to get to number 17 in time. Stu, Australia Grease \u2013 \u2018I spent 32 Saturday afternoons at the ABC cinema\u2019 I couldn\u2019t wait for Grease to be released in September 1978. You\u2019re the One That I Want had topped the charts all summer and every Thursday I\u2019d sit waiting to see the video on Top of the Pops. The world of Rydell High in the 50s was a world away from a 70s Edinburgh council estate. Then a rumour started that Grease would be classified AA, meaning nobody under 14 could see it. I was gutted. Luckily that was wrong, it was an A, and I spent the next 32 Saturday afternoons at the ABC cinema, Lothian Road, watching first a 20-minute short film about skateboarding that had Chris Montez\u2019s Let\u2019s Dance as its theme, then came Danny and Sandy at the beach, Love Is a Many Splendored Thing playing in the background, before the cartoon credits rolled. Sam, Edinburgh Roma \u2013 \u2018I felt like I was in the streets of Mexico City\u2019 After the whole debacle between Netflix and established cinema chains across the world, I was happy to see that the EYE Filmmuseum in Amsterdam was showing Alfonso Cu\u00e1ron\u2019s Roma. Not only that, but the screening was in their state-of-the-art Cinema 1, with 4K resolution and beautiful, crisp surround sound. This elevates the already profound experience of Roma to a whole new level: you can feel yourself in the busy streets of Mexico City. I went several times, and took different friends each time. We pretty much all agreed that Roma was meant to be seen on a big screen, with great sound, rather than a tiny computer screen and tinny speakers. This is the kind of film that asks for complete immersion into a time, setting and aesthetic \u2013 it is a shame that it couldn\u2019t be experienced that way by the majority of the public. J Medina, Amsterdam The Warriors \u2013 \u2018Police frogmarched us into waiting vans\u2019 I went to see this film six times in the two weeks it played at our local Unit 4. That first time, it took my breath away \u2013 I\u2019d never seen anything as captivating. Everything, from the premise to the music, the actors and the action itself (the fight scenes especially) was a revelation to this small-town 20-year-old. Thrilling. I also fell in love with one of the extras, which must\u2019ve been part of the draw (the young woman with the long blonde hair in the Lizzies scene). A week later, myself and a group of friends went to see it again in Rawtenstall: we were passing joints around when suddenly the lights came on and police streamed in and frogmarched us out, into waiting vans. Busted! Martin Peacock, Accrington Blade Runner \u2013 \u2018They could release a one-second edit tomorrow and I\u2019d be the first to buy a ticket\u2019 While I saw the 1982 theatrical cut on TV and really liked it, I fell in love with the director\u2019s cut and saw it four times in two weeks when it was released in cinemas in 1992. This doesn\u2019t sound like much, but if you consider the three different versions of Blade Runner to be \u201cone film\u201d, then I\u2019ve seen it over 20 times at the cinema. They could release a fourth version tomorrow with the only difference being a one-second cut to an incidental scene and I\u2019d be the first to buy a ticket. You really can\u2019t beat seeing those stunning visuals on the big screen and hearing Vangelis\u2019s gorgeous soundtrack in the theatre. I\u2019m lucky that the Astor in Melbourne screens it about once a year, although there\u2019s not one currently scheduled for 2019 (strange given that\u2019s the year the movie is set). Neill Brown, Melbourne Psycho \u2013 \u2018Seeing it with a new audience made me experience it differently\u2019 I see new details and nuances each time. Recently, for example, I noticed the wire rakes in the garden shop Marion\u2019s boyfriend works in, and their resemblance to skeletal claws. But why was such an image planted there, rather than in the Bates Motel? This kicked off a line of enquiry I will take into my next viewing. I also find seeing the film each time with a new audience helps me to experience it in its totality quite differently. Recent viewings have opened my eyes to its sly humour. Emotionally, I identify with those in the audience seeing the film for the first time and share with them the frisson of its unravelling. Alex, London Bunty Aur Babli \u2013 \u2018We never tired of it\u2019 My 16-year-old daughter and I completely fell in love with this film (we were seeing a lot of Bollywood films at the time), and returned at least six times over the course of a couple of weeks, taking with us various reluctant friends each time. We loved the adventurous characters (played by Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukerji) and their slow-burn romance, the high-spirited (but never mean-spirited) capers they ran, and their pursuit by a wily cop played by legendary superstar Amitabh Bachchan (Abhishek\u2019s father). We adored the music, lusted after the clothes, and never got tired of it, even after we knew the Hindi dialogue by heart. Laura Boyes, North Carolina Brokeback Mountain \u2013 \u2018The story really got under my skin\u2019 I stumbled on Annie Proulx\u2019s short story and it captivated me. I was in my mid 40s when the movie was released and I went to see it solo at a matinee here in San Francisco. I was so moved I was shaking when I left the cinema and, afraid I was going to burst into tears, had to hide behind a pillar to smoke a cigarette. My hand was trembling as I tried to light it. I went back seven times, sometimes alone and sometimes with friends. I became fixated on certain scenes and would watch them over and over again on YouTube \u2013 the story really got under my skin and I spent a year on IMDb discussing it with other fans. Trevor Martin, San Francisco Batman (1989) \u2013 \u2018I went seven times and thought I knew it inside out\u2019 I turned 20 in the summer of 1989 and went crazy for Tim Burton\u2019s first Batman film. Maybe because it was the first \u201cproper\u201d superhero film since Superman II \u2026 maybe it was because it had a great soundtrack by Prince and a moody score by Danny Elfman (I bought both albums on various formats) and maybe because I loved the sartorial choices on display (double-breasted suits and 40s fedoras), but I couldn\u2019t get enough of it. At the time I had a girlfriend in Venice, and when I went in October to visit her the movie had just been released there. Naturally, we went to see the film on a date (her first viewing, my eighth). When we came out she said she loved the moment when Bruce Wayne got shot through his jacket and didn\u2019t notice. My jaw dropped. I\u2019d seen the film so many times and hadn\u2019t noticed that detail. I saw it again recently and I felt no wave of nostalgia, just a sense of huge disappointment. \u201cIs that it?\u201d I thought.
