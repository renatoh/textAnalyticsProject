The prime minister continues to insist there is \"no ideological bar\" to the use of private companies. The health secretary insisted on Monday that the NHS was \"not up for sale\", that reform would be driven by NHS staff. But a day earlier he had listed four areas where the private sector would be involved including 24-hour fast-track surgery units. Rarely has a government so wilfully squandered a workforce's goodwill, which it desperately needs if its 10-year plans for the reform of education and health are to succeed. It is almost a year since its NHS plan, with its bold commitment to modernise the service and make it more patient-oriented, was published. It was an inspiring time, filled with hope. One year on those same names, who remain crucial if the troops are to be rallied behind the plan, have been kept in the dark as ministers blow hot and cold about the role of the private sector. This disillusion has only been made more acute by this week's report from the Institute for Public Policy Research, which expressed severe doubts that public-pri vate partnerships had provided value for money in education and health. It rejected the idea, pushed by ministers, that raising private cash for public buildings like hospitals created \"extra\" investment. Wednesday night's Downing Street dinner between union leaders and ministers has not resolved the issue because there is still no clear clarification of the extent to which the private sector will be drawn in. The biggest public service union, Unison, was far from satisfied. A bandwagon of opposition is rolling, ranging from Labour activists to Lord Hattersley's columns in the Guardian and Observer, all of which will divert ministers from where their focus should be: delivery. It was seriously wrong to introduce a private-sector debate. The challenge ministers were facing was daunting enough: reforming public services from within. Services are finally starting to get the resources so long denied: a one third real rise in spending within five years for education and health. If this does not raise standards, then other alternatives should be explored. But not yet. Public services have a right to demonstrate they can do it: the private sector's contribution can only be at the periphery. Tony Blair must spell this out unequivocally."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
