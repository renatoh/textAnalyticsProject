He was given a hard time by his former club's fans and, just to ensure he is under no illusions about the task ahead, his own supporters appeared apathetic, apart from periodically showing their displeasure at Rangers' faltering efforts. McLeish will effectively take over this morning when his priorities will be for a no-frills, no-nonsense central defender, to play alongside Craig Moore and Lorenzo Amoruso, plus an abrasive midfield man and two class acts up front. He will also need all the help he can get from the Rangers supporters, who have remained defiantly loyal in the past 18 months even if they have tended to sit on their hands. There has, though, been a marked lack of enthusiasm for the new man because of his previous success as a player at Aberdeen and he will have to win them over quickly. He will also have to work hard to ensure his \"partnership\" with his predecessor and now director of football Dick Advocaat works. The pair, on the surface at least, appear unlikely allies and the new set-up is doomed from the outset if they fail to find common ground. He will have to sort out the backroom staff into the bargain because a preponderance of Dutchmen causes dismay in some quarters. Last night's match proved an interesting introduction for McLeish. He watched in something approaching admiration as his new team produced some delightful early football - and then in horror as they went a goal down on 22 minutes. All seemed in order initially and within two minutes Nick Colgan was forced into a decent save to deny Shota Arveladze, then a Maurice Ross header was cleared off the line by David Zitelli. But then Hibs struck. Two days ago McLeish would have leapt in delight as Zitelli crossed from the left and Francisco Luna planted a firm header past Stefan Klos, but now it was all a bit different. Instead he had to sit and suffer alongside his loyal assistant Andy Watson in the row in front of the chairman David Murray in the directors' box as the pair took copious notes and listened to chants from the visiting fans of \"What's the score, Judas?\" Things improved for Rangers after the interval and, with Neil McCann and Stephen Hughes on for Tore Andre Flo and Scott Wilson, they equalised after 58 minutes when Arveladze set up Fernando Ricksen for a shot that took a wicked deflection off Paul Fenwick. Thereafter it was virtually one-way traffic but McCann and Arthur Numan missed great chances. Earlier McLeish made a low-key entrance. Circumstances dictated a degree of decorum and, together with Watson, he squirmed and fidgeted his way through the 90 minutes well away from the action. Quite what they made of it all is a mystery for the moment and they are unlikely to make their most private of thoughts known too publicly anyway, although they will share them with their players when they get together for the first time this morning. Since the appointment was confirmed on Tuesday evening McLeish has kept his distance and allowed Advocaat to take a final bow prior to his move upstairs. But he will be at the new training ground with Watson this morning to take control. Most of the players they will meet have been taken to Ibrox by Advocaat, and McLeish will have serious adjustments to make. He is unlikely to tolerate the kind of defensive mistakes that have so blighted Rangers in recent times, especially given his stature as a former central defender himself. He is equally unlikely to view with the kind of fatherly eye Advocaat appeared to adopt the continued underachieving of such players as Ronald de Boer and Flo. The Dutchman and the Norwegian cost Rangers something approaching \u00a317m, which is more than Hibernian FC, including its Easter Road stadium and players, is worth. The irony of that will not be lost on the former Hibs manager who has had to watch the pennies in the past. The pair, the club's highest earners, appear more often than not to lack a devotion to the cause. McLeish has vowed to give 100% effort himself to restore Rangers to what he believes is the club's rightful place at the top of the tree in Scotland and woe betide anyone who does not share that view. McLeish did not mess around as a player for Aberdeen and Scotland. He will not mess around now at Ibrox."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
