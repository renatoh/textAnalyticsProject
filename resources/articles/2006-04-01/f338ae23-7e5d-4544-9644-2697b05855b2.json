G Funk Era album, and has spent the last decade recreating itsinfluential fusion of west coast beats, mellow soul and supremely laid-back MCing. This is his fourth album since, and despite sounding a lot like its predecessors, it's a departure from the norm. Warren is pushing a new \"responsible\" agenda that aims to deglamorise the gangsta lifestyle he helped popularise. His advice, jauntily delivered on the irresistible, brassy Get U Down: \"Homey, don't you end up dead or in jail.\" Snoop is on hand, too, sleepily enthusing about football, while Walk These Streets is the ultimate string-laden feel-good moment. Sweet - but will aforesaid homeys relate to Warren the Dad?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
