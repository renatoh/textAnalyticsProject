Get in touch", "bodyText": "On 15 April 2019, thousands of protestors took to the streets of London to call on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025. After hosting several protests in previous months, Extinction Rebellion embarked on a \u201cclimate rebellion\u201d \u2013 its largest coordinated climate action to date. Demonstrators occupied five landmarks \u2013 Waterloo Bridge, Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus \u2013 while smaller protests took place in other cities around the world. Since then, the group has protested London Fashion Week, disrupted public transport, and blocked bridges around the country \u2013 often dividing public opinion. A year on from the group\u2019s major protests, we\u2019d like to hear from those involved in the movement about their experiences, and their hopes for the future. Share your thoughts How do you feel about Extinction Rebellion a year since the climate rebellion? Is the group still going strong, or has it lost momentum? How has the group\u2019s actions made an impact? And what are your hopes for the future of the movement? You can get in touch by filling in the form below.
