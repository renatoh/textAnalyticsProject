At the simplest level, Celtic is shoring up its balance sheet so that it can keep pace with the pay demands of players and the international transfer market, but the detail of the rights issue reveals a club that is determined to plan for a solid future in an industry that risks being littered with financial casualties. Dermot Desmond, the Irish financier who is now the club's largest shareholder and a non-executive director, says the club's priority is to match the on-field success of last season with a commercial rigour that delivers profit. 'There will not be annual subventions from the shareholders,' he says. 'Celtic has to be run as a business. The first priority was to get a manager who could deliver success on the field. The second was to find a chief executive to bring the financial disciplines. We have done that.' Martin O'Neill, lured from Leicester City at the end of last season after the brief and disastrous reigns of John Barnes and Kenny Dalglish, has already delivered beyond the club's wildest dreams in his first season by winning the League championship and both domestic cup competitions. A generous share options scheme will now try to tie him to the club's future. O'Neill was joined earlier this year by Ian McLeod, the chief executive charged with turning O'Neill's success into profit. Despite O'Neill's triumphs, it won't be easy. In its last financial year, as the team struggled on the pitch, it recorded losses of \u00a36.5m and its debts rose to \u00a330m. Celtic's fundamental problem is its location: Scotland and the Scottish league are too small and financially limited to sustain a club with its ambitions, its fan base and its cost base. Like its Glasgow rival Rangers, Celtic's priority is to play a part in a league that commands respect and cash from television. Last year, Desmond points out, Celtic received just \u00a33m from Sky television: O'Neill's former club, Leicester, a middle-ranking English premiership club that flirted with relegation, received \u00a315m. Desmond's preferred solutions are what he terms a North Atlantic league of small countries such as Holland, Portugal, Scotland and the Scandinavian nations. Pitching Celtic and Rangers into regular competition against Holland's Ajax or Portugal's Benfica would, he believes, create a league of a quality to rival Italy's Serie A or Spain's Liga. And, of course, Desmond would like to see Celtic in the English premiership. O'Neill's significance to the club, and its future, is underlined in the rights issue by an award of options worth \u00a32m: a golden handcuff that Desmond and his board hope will keep O'Neill at Celtic Park for years to come. O'Neill has already turned down an offer of a directorship, but the offer remains open. 'If Martin wants to join the board, he can join the board,' says Desmond. The Celtic board, which includes former Bank of England director Brian Quinn and former BAT chief Sir Patrick Sheehy, is also seeking approval to almost treble its authorised share capital and wants to increase to nearly \u00a370m the amount that the directors can borrow without recourse to shareholders. But there is no prospect of a spending spree. O'Neill is likely to have about \u00a320m to invest in the transfer market, but Desmond says Celtic will not try to buy success. 'The key issue in the transfer market is value: Martin spends \u00a31 and gets \u00a33 of value. Previous managers have spent \u00a31 and delivered 10p of value. We are not about spending money to buy championships; we are building. The Manchester United team that won the champions league didn't cost a fortune, but it took time.' For Desmond, the biggest problem facing football is the financial difficulties threatening to cripple clubs across Europe. 'All the authorities are concerned: debt levels are rising, overheads are rising and losses are rising. But capital subventions are coming to an end because many clubs have already sold the family silver: they've pawned everything for the future. 'There has to be order imposed on the market. Clubs should only be allowed to spend a stipulated percentage of their revenues on the transfer market, and a stipulated percentage on their players' wages. The authorities will just have to impose restrictions,' he says. Celtic at present has to seek profit from its existing operations. On the positive side, the Scottish treble achieved by O'Neill's team has seen merchandising sales boom. In the longer term, Desmond believes that the club's decision to hold on to its own media rights will pay handsome dividends. 'Controlling the media rights means controlling the brand. Football is going to get bigger and bigger and it's an outlet for everybody - third-generation mobile phones, the internet, television. Football is getting more important, content is important and clubs that control their own content will be more and more valuable in the future,' he says. The rights issue also has a few peculiarities that should appeal to hardcore supporters with a minimum \u00a3550 to invest. As well as a fixed dividend of 4 per cent on the new stock, there will also be an extra 'participating dividend' tied to the club's success, or failure, in the European champions league which pays out a maximum 6 per cent if the club reaches the semi-finals, and nothing if it fails to qualify. Shareholders will also receive a special-edition certificate featuring the treble winning team. Desmond, who owns just under 20 per cent of the club, will take up his rights and could see his stake rise to the high twenties depending on how many other shareholders apply. But he is not planning to get more involved. 'The more successful the club, the more I can step back,' he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
