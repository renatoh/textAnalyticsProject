It\u2019s where my mum spends a lot of time, so I\u2019m here seeing her. I\u2019ve been coming since I was a kid. As a teenager, the place throbbed with romantic possibilities. The girls were all improbably beautiful and, what with my passable Croatian, replete with charming grammatical errors and Birmingham accent, I felt very sure they would find me irresistible. Girls at home found me to be very resistible indeed, but this would surely be different. I came with a couple of mates during the summer after our O-levels, and did the same with another couple of mates the summer of our A-levels. I also came before, during and after university, and have been many times thereafter. However, my success rate with the opposite sex in Croatia was, and remains, at absolute zero. Not even a sniff of success. In fact, to borrow a phrase from the legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly about a terrible performance, I was so bad I was lucky to get nil. To this day, the country knocks edges off me like nobody\u2019s business. At home, you see, I\u2019m quite well known. For many years I was on telly every day, appearing before many different audiences: Working Lunch on BBC Two, Match of the Day 2, The Apprentice, The One Show, the Olympics, ITV football, Daybreak and various documentaries. So people tend to recognise me. They either know who I am, or have a vague idea. They\u2019ll have a stab if they\u2019re not sure. Many times I\u2019ve been asked if I\u2019m Ray Mears; on more than one occasion, if I\u2019m John Motson. It\u2019s usually nice to be recognised \u2013 I happen to like talking to people. But it\u2019s also kind of oppressive to an extent I don\u2019t realise until I come to Croatia. Suddenly I can sit in a cafe without getting odd looks and stares. Nor do I catch people Googling away, showing each other their phones, and saying: \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s that guy who used to be on telly all the time.\u201d And I don\u2019t get asked about West Brom, or how much I\u2019m drinking these days. It\u2019s a blessed relief, for about a day. And then I go to the supermarket for my mum and take my place in the queue for the cashier. When I get to the front, I find myself half-raising my eyebrows as a means of conveying a modest: Yes, it\u2019s me. The look comes back with a clear: So what? Why are you looking at me like that? I don\u2019t know you at all. You\u2019re just a middle-aged guy in a queue in a shop. It turns out that recognition is more a gift than a curse \u2013 as long, I suppose, as you\u2019re not recognised for being a serial killer or some such. Recognition gets you off the mark. In golfing terms, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve already played one decent shot down the fairway. A Croatian friend over here tried to help me out in Zagreb once. It was mortifying. He told this statuesque Croatian princess that I was extremely famous and successful in the UK. \u201cKaj? On?\u201d she said. What? Him? Incredulous but unimpressed, she moved on. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
