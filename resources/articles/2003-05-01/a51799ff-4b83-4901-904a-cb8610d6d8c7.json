Mark Richards \u00b7 Bangkok Airways are the only airline who flies from Bangkok to Koh Samui, resulting in limited availability at peak holiday times. The best option to guarantee a flight is to book in advance direct from their website. Craig Schuler \u00b7 If you are travelling at a \"peak time\" I would strongly advise pre-booking as flights do fill up very quickly. You really don't want to have to sit around Bangkok Domestic on standby. Once we had our flights to Bangkok we rang Thai Domestic (in Bangkok) and booked from home. The phone call is not that expensive - even when they put you on hold! They booked us seats that allowed for our London - Bangkok arriving late. In the event, our flight was on time so that, when we arrived at the Domestic Terminal, they put us on the earlier flight (ahead of people on standby).
