Although Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has suggested that Manchester United might step in to sign the young Uruguayan, who was first capped by his country at 16 and is currently surplus to requirements at Juventus, Carini's wages will startle even the Old Trafford accountants. Sources in Turin report that the 21-year-old's current contract with the Italian club is worth $1.2m (\u00a3790,000) a year after tax - much more than Arsenal had been led to believe they would have to pay to secure his year-long loan. But while that figure in itself may have come as a surprise, Wenger and the Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein were astounded to discover that Carini's contract at Juventus specified that as soon as he had played 15 first-team games his wages would automatically double to $2.4m a season net of tax. Arsenal had believed that Carini would eventually succeed David Seaman, and he was likely to play at least 20 games this season, but his wage demands immediately threatened to derail negotiations. Carini's agent Paco Casal agreed that the goalkeeper's double-your-money clause could be dropped if Arsenal were prepared to pay a revised wage of $1.6m (\u00a31.05m) a year - considerably more than would normally be budgeted for a young player who is on loan and not a first choice. In addition, the player's agent demanded a minimum number of flights back to Uruguay during the season - first class, of course - adding several thousand pounds to the bill. However, the deal may not have collapsed completely. Carini has not been registered by Juventus for the new season after Luciano Moggi, the club's chief executive, promised to find him a new club. But unless he revises his wage demands, Carini could find himself without a team at all. The Arsenal and England left-back Ashley Cole yesterday denied accusations of cheating after his exaggerated reaction to the challenge from Birmingham's Aliou Ciss\u00e9 on Sunday that led to the Senegalese midfielder being sent off. \"I do not dive,\" he said. \"I am not a cheat and I have never tried to get another player sent off. Never. He did make contact with me even if it was only slight. I was hurt, but I got up again as soon as I could. I didn't stay down for a long time or anything.\" Ciss\u00e9 also backed Cole, saying: \"I made hardly any contact with him, if at all, and I certainly did not deserve to be sent off. But he did not try to get me sent off and I do not blame him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
