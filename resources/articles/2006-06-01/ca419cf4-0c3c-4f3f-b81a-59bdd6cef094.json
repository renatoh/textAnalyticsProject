The green room looked like one of those Victorian paintings in which all the leading artists, or politicians, or aristocrats of the day were gathered artificially together, as if they were all in the same place at once. Except they were actually there: Paul Merton, Barry Cryer, Jo Brand, Mark Steel, Jeremy Hardy, Andy Hamilton, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Sandi Toksvig, Graeme Garden, Liza Tarbuck, Mark Thomas, Hattie Heyridge, Phill Jupitus, with Humphrey Lyttelton sitting down, gazing with grandparental concern over the teeming throng. I was there to chair The News Quiz for the last time, a quick 10-minute slot in the first half. \u00b7 As at all charity events the timing went wildly awry. Things were running 10 minutes late by the end of the first turn. We got on stage 20 minutes after we were due to finish. But that was fine, because it gave me the chance to eavesdrop the backstage gossip and hear the gags comedians tell each other. There is good reason for this - many of them are far too filthy for not just a family audience, but for many unmarried persons too. One I can repeat came, once again, from Barry Cryer. He was apologetic because it's an Irish joke, and was well aware that we don't tell Irish jokes these days. But who can we tell similar gags about? Is there any social or ethnic group left we may draft for the purpose? Possibly not, in which case an entire genre of jokes is lost. Anyhow, here it is: Irishman goes for a job at a blacksmith's. The blacksmith asks, \"Have you ever shoed a horse?\" \"No, sorry,\" says the Irishman, \"but I once told a pig to fuck off.\" \u00b7 I'd come down that afternoon from the Hay festival, which gets five stars in my Good Literary Festival guide. In the sunshine Hay is a magical place, its 40-odd bookshops scattered among the hilly streets, some tiny places where you knock your head on oak beams, others huge like the Cinema Bookshop, which contains millions of books and where a half-hour browse can net you a dozen new volumes to cherish. I love the random nature of meetings in the artistes' lounge. This year I introduced David Lodge to the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, though I didn't notice them swapping email addresses afterwards. There are wonderful parties in country mansions where the booze flows freely and you can easily spill wine over someone truly famous, like Vikram Seth. (I just managed not to.) They don't pay, but they do send you away with lots of goodies, and it was fun to see how some writers, millionaires in a few cases, made absolutely certain that they got theirs. If you were pretty ruthless, as we were, you could legitimately walk away with a half dozen bottles of really good sparkling wine, fairtrade tea, coffee, cocoa and chocolate, a cafetiere, an Orla Kiely designer umbrella, and a single, long-stemmed white rose. All of which is probably worth less than \u00a3100, yet somehow seems much more gratifying than a cheque for that amount ever could. \u00b7 The new Oxford Dictionary of American Political Slang is just out, and it's a great read. Their language is so much more vigorous and exciting than ours, which is one reason why we adopt it: gerrymander, lame duck, and spin doctor, for example, are all American terms. Just look at, say, B, and you come up with \"bomfog\", short for \"the Brotherhood of Man under the Fatherhood of God\" used by Rockefeller in 1941, now used to mean any vapid platitude; or to \"bork\", meaning to conduct a ferocious media campaign against a nominee, after Robert Bork, a candidate for the supreme court who failed after being thoroughly borked in 1987. Teddy Roosevelt's \"bully pulpit\" is here, though in those days \"bully\" just meant \"terrific\", as in \"bully for you\". We have political slang, but not as much. There's \"clear blue water\", a real ideological gap; and \"singing from the same hymn sheet\", meaning getting the party to agree in public is, I think, British as well. I was sorry that the new dictionary misses two of my favourite American sayings. \"Clean his clock\" means to defeat utterly, and comes from the world of clock-cleaning by way of boxing. It means to completely disassemble an opponent, like someone laying out the clock's component parts. And \"the opera ain't over till the fat lady sings\", used when one result seems certain, but the opposite is still possible. It was used in 1978 by Dan Cook, a sports broadcaster in San Antonio, after the local basketball team had gone 3-1 down to the Washington Bullets. The Bullets coach picked up the phrase as an exhortation, and took it back to Washington where it passed into daily political parlance. Years later, when the Baltimore Orioles baseball team made a terrible start to the season, the club plastered the city with giant posters showing a massive, open-mouthed woman in a horned helmet, topped with the legend: \"She ain't sung yet.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
