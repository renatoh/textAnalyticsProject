The upper house MP wrote to Greens head office on Tuesday demanding a recount of the ballot, citing \u201cserious democratic flaws\u201d in the result following the party\u2019s decision to ask Jeremy Buckingham to vacate his spot on the ticket for the next state election in March. In a letter seen by Guardian Australia, Walker wrote that a recount was \u201cvital to ensure that the preferences of the almost one-third of Greens NSW members who voted for Jeremy Buckingham No 1 in the preselection ballot are not disenfranchised\u201d. She said the ticket put forward should reflect \u201cthe democratic intention of members and our key principle of grassroots democracy\u201d. It follows the decision on Saturday by the Greens state delegate council to pass a motion calling on Buckingham to remove himself from the party\u2019s ticket. Following the decision, Buckingham said the party processes had been \u201cabused and co-opted for factional purposes\u201d and said he was considering his legal options. A factional ally of Buckingham, Walker is hoping to secure a recount of the preselection ballot in the hope of having her position on the ballot bumped up from the unwinnable fourth position to second. In May, the NSW upper house MP David Shoebridge claimed top spot on the party\u2019s ticket ahead of Buckingham in the preselection ballot \u2013 1,161 primary votes to 780. It marked an important victory for the party\u2019s left faction and meant Buckingham was relegated to third spot on the ticket below Abigail Boyd because the party\u2019s rules stipulate that at least one of the top two spots must be held by a woman. Boyd secured second spot on preferences ahead of Walker, who entered the upper house last year, replacing retiring MP Jan Barham. But supporters of Walker hope if a recount were to occur, Walker could overtake Boyd off the back of Buckingham\u2019s preferences. \u201cIn the event that Jeremy Buckingham is not on the NSW Greens Legislative Council ticket for the 2019 NSW state election, the preselection ballot that determined the ticket will have serious democratic flaws and the make-up of the ticket will not reflect the democratic intention of the members of the NSW Greens,\u201d Walker wrote on Tuesday. \u201cIf Jeremy was excluded from the count and his 780 first-preference votes were distributed prior to the first count, the order of the ballot may have been different and would have directly elected a woman into the second position, as per the Greens NSW constitution.\u201d But the Greens\u2019 NSW co-convener Sylvia Hale said that while the party would give Walker\u2019s request \u201cdue consideration\u201d, a recount would \u201cbe a break from precedent and would involve establishing a new process\u201d. \u201cThe Greens NSW constitution and preselection rules do not currently provide for a recount,\u201d she said. Walker\u2019s demand marks the latest escalation of a factional war that has gripped the party since Greens state lower house MP Jenny Leong used the parliament to accuse Buckingham of committing an \u201cact of sexual violence\u201d against party aide Ella Buckland in 2011. An independent investigation was unable to substantiate Buckland\u2019s claims, and Buckingham has strenuously denied them. However, Leong\u2019s speech under parliamentary privilege caused a deep rift within the party and led to open hostilities within the NSW branch of the party, leading to Saturday\u2019s motion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
