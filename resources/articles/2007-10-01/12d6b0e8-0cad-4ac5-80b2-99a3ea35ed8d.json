The 21 year-old Cockney chanteuse, as she's been christened by the local press, patronised several pubs, including the Black Bear whose car park abuts the cottage where she was staying. Landlady Gill Smith said: \"I'd never really heard of her but it was thrilling for the kids,\" while pub chef John Downes chipped in: \"We could hear her singing. The window was pounding. She sounded quite good, but I prefer Echo and the Bunnymen.\" A singer from an altogether older generation, Graham McPherson, aka Suggs of Madness, returned to his old school yesterday to give singing lessons. The alma mater in question is Quintin Kynaston comprehensive in St John's Wood, north London, once notorious for the behaviour of its pupils but now under its head Jo Shuter apparently a model of decorum. Suggs said that in his day it was full of boys expelled from other schools. But Ms Shuter, who is in line for the Teaching Awards' Secondary Head of the Year for her work over the past five years, says that the admission of girls has added value. The school has become something of a showcase for passing politicians too - it's where Tony Blair announced his impending resignation last year. A PR marriage made in heaven has been announced between Colleen Harris, former press officer to Prince Charles, and Peter Dobbie, genial former political columnist of the Mail on Sunday who recently took early retirement. You might think two such pedigrees might not get on too well, but not a bit of it: the two are setting up a PR agency together. It will be called Dignity. John McDonnell, Labour MP for Hayes and Harlington, is tabling an unusual early day motion in the Commons today on behalf of one of his constituents, seeking to reopen a 56-year-old naval mystery. It surrounds the fate of HMS Affray, the last submarine lost by the Navy, off the Solent in 1951. The cause - possibly shoddy maintenance - was hushed up at the time, but is to be highlighted in a new book by author Alan Gallop. stephen.bates@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false}}}
