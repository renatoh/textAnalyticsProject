Killer gadget! [Update]", "bodyText": "Mitch Altman's TV-B-Gone is \"a new universal remote that turns off almost any television. The device, which looks like an automobile remote, has just one button. When activated, it spends over a minute flashing out 209 different codes to turn off televisions, the most popular brands first,\" reports Wired News. \"Altman said people who hear about TV-B-Gone start thinking about other nuisances.
