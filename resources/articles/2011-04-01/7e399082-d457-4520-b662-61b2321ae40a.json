Two hundred and sixty athletes (170 men and 90 women) will compete in this event with some of the strongest competitors lifting more than three times their own body weight. Who's hot The German Matthias Stainer will be hoping to add to the gold medal he won in the +105kg category in Beijing but he will have to beat Evgeny Chigishev of Russia and Behdad Salimikordasiabi of Iran. In the women's +75kg category Tatiana Kashirina of Russia is likely to be one of the favourites for gold.
