Harriet Harman, the constitutional affairs minister, kept the succession issue simmering by arguing that \"right at the top we need a team of women and men\". She told Sunday AM on BBC1: \"Tony Blair himself has got to make and he said he wants a stable and orderly transition. But in the meantime we're taking the opportunity of saying, let's not just assume that that stable and orderly transition is from one group of men to another group of men. \"Maternity pay and leave is a huge political issue, as is childcare. And I think that what's important for a party that believes in equality is that we are a team of women and men. And I don't think women in the country will believe that there will be a guarantee for further improvement on childcare and maternity leave and pay unless there's women up there pushing for it.\" Ms Harman, sacked as social security secretary in 1998 before being brought back to a ministerial job outside the cabinet in 2001, has argued that the party needs two deputies when John Prescott stands down. She has boosted her profile in recent weeks but can expect to face challenges from Alan Johnson, the education secretary, and the leader of the house, Jack Straw - both of whom have declared their intentions to run in the last 10 days - and probably Peter Hain, the Northern Ireland secretary. She will support Gordon Brown for the premiership, but Mr Brown is thought not to favour her as deputy. Lord Hattersley, deputy leader under Neil Kinnock, told Sunday AM that Mr Blair should quit at Labour's party conference in Manchester in September. \"Since we know he's going to go there's an illogical nonsense in saying let's start reinvigorating the party, however in six months' time, a year's time, two years' time there'll have to be this sea change, a new Labour, a new leader. I think in the party's interests and the government's interests, and the country's interests, Tony Blair should go very quickly indeed. And I think until that happens the real policy of reinvigoration can't be put in place in a way I want to see.\" Lord Hattersley said he was \"unequivocally in favour of Gordon Brown\", who would deliver \"more radical policies\" once he was able to take over as prime minister. \"The idea that Gordon is going to take us back to a 1945 Labour party is a canard put about by the Tory party and some of Tony Blair's more fanatical friends.\" Hazel Blears, the Labour chairman, reflected the dismay among Mr Blair's allies at the continuing speculation over his leadership, which she said was felt by party members and the public. \"People are angry. They are a bit annoyed with us that we appear to be taking our eye off the ball. They want us to get on with the job,\" she told the Politics Show on BBC1. \"Voters get very impatient with us when we talk to ourselves about our interests in particular jobs. They have given us a job to get on with and it's part of my job to make sure that everybody in our government focuses on doing just that.\" She added: \"They elected us just a year ago to carry on doing all the things we have been doing for the last eight or nine years. We have to focus relentlessly on that.\" But of the suggestions thatTony Blair's decision to confirm he would not fight the next general election had led to a \"furore\", she conceded: \"I cannot say that I can make that go away.\" Newspapers at the weekend reported that Mr Blair had been told by Albert Owen, MP for Ynys Mon, that his position was \"unsustainable\" and that he had \"got to go\", when he held a meeting with the Welsh parliamentary Labour party at Downing Street last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
