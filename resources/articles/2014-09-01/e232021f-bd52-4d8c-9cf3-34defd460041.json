Certain topics are de rigeur here, in the flash Madison Avenue branch of Belstaff where Beckham is promoting his new line of biker jackets- fashion, his life, his family, likes and dislikes. Wallpaper magazine wants to ask him about motorbikes. I have asked him the famous internet question: would you rather fight a hundred duck-sized horses, or one duck the size of a horse? In doing so, I have committed the faux pas of non-sequitur. Apart from everything else, I was only supposed to be allowed one question. But Beckham is charming about it nonetheless, taking as much time to mull it over as he has questions about the jackets \u2013 if anything, more. In a way, this is more Victoria\u2019s world than David\u2019s. She is the fashion designer in the family, he is clear about that, but when I ask if he feels in her shadow, he demurrs. \u201cObviously she\u2019s doing something far bigger than what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he says, his voice at once familiarly comical and at the same time deeper and more grown-up. He is, after all, going to be 40 next year. He is clearly very proud of his wife. \u201cMine\u2019s a capsule collection \u2013 and something that I\u2019ve been obviously 100% involved in with every detail,\u201d he says. \u201cBut obviously with Victoria\u2019s it\u2019s a whole different monster. She\u2019s done so well; over the years, what she\u2019s created, and how she\u2019s gained the respect of the fashion industry.\u201d Celebrity fashion launches like this are high-pressure scenarios. Journalists are herded into small groups of five or six by nationality, and Beckham is presented to each group for a brief allotted period of time. The journalists are told they are strictly allowed one question each, which naturally means almost everybody asks two or three. \u201cThis is a cruel question,\u201d one journalist from the Telegraph asks. \u201cI noticed you\u2019ve got a big birthday next year.\u201d It is his second question. \u201cIt\u2019s classic that when someone hit\u2019s a certain age they get a bike, don\u2019t they \u2013 how are you feeling about the arrival of 40?\u201d Incidentally, this is roughly when I decide to ask the question about the duck-sized horses. Beckham is equanimous. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those people that\u2019s not looking forward to getting old,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m happy where I am in my life at the moment. I\u2019ve had a pretty successful career, on the pitch obviously, and a year and a half ago it started off the pitch. There\u2019s many things I\u2019m working on; I have four amazing children, an amazing wife.\u201d \u201cI started riding about eight years ago,\u201d he goes on, \u201cso the mid-life started early. But no. I\u2019m happy with where I am in my life now, and I\u2019m looking forward to my birthday. Hopefully it\u2019ll be a low-key one,\u201d he adds with a chuckle. In fact, it is when he talks about motorbikes that he visibly comes alive. He had his own bike built, he tells the assembled journalists; a 93 Harley-Davidson Knucklehead, with 1920s and 1930s parts. \u201cIt took about a year to build the bike,\u201d he says. \u201cI was going in weekly, like, \u2018How\u2019s it coming along?\u2019 \u2018What are you doing?\u2019\u201d That was the motorbike on which he had an accident, just a week ago. Papers reported at the time that he lost control and fell off; but when asked about it, he is clear that\u2019s not what happened. \u201cI got hit off my bike,\u201d he says. \u201cMy first time. Not a great experience, but I was lucky. Riding bikes is dangerous at times, but so is walking down the street. It\u2019s not a nice experience, but it happened. Luckily I only suffered a few bruises and cuts, and a dislocated thumb.\u201d To everyone present\u2019s surprise, perhaps not least his own, he gives the horse-sized-duck question genuine thought. One or two of the assembled flacks glance around nervously as Beckham, for a brief moment, looks at the ceiling. \u201cDuck-sized horses. Yeah. That one, I think,\u201d he says. Someone \u2013 the reporter from Wallpaper, I think it is \u2013 suggests that perhaps he could kick them. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, uncertainly, then muses, \u201cmaybe I\u2019d let them win.\u201d Then, his handler calls time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
