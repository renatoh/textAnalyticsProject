This camp, the conditions are really harsh because people are really depressed. There\u2019s lots of pressure and they\u2019re trying to kill themselves. Some of my friends really did that.\u201d By the end of last week, Guardian Australia reported, there had been 26 cases of attempted suicide or self-harm since the 18 May election, when the Morrison government \u2013 with its hardline stance on asylum seekers \u2013 was returned to power. For Bandesh, who has been detained in Papua New Guinea for six years, music and art provide a means of spiritual escape. A musician and instrument maker in his native Kurdistan \u2013 he dabbled in punk and flamenco, as well as making his own guitars \u2013 Bandesh has been writing songs, painting and making jewellery in the time he has been detained. \u201cWhen I create something, I really want to share it with other people,\u201d he says. His latest release is The Big Exhale: the result of a collaboration with the Australian musicians David Bridie and Jenell Quinsee, who helped write and mix it half an ocean away. Imran Mohammed, an asylum seeker eventually resettled to the US, has called Manus Island as \u201can inescapable corner\u201d. The journalist Behrouz Boochani, also detained on Manus, describes in his multiple-award winning biography No Friend But the Mountains a system in which \u201cthe prison dictates that the prisoner accept, to some degree, that they are wretched and contemptible\u201d. The Big Exhale film clip, which was uploaded to YouTube last week, is shot through with those feelings of hopelessness and trauma. It was made in collaboration with the Melbourne-based production company Wendyhouse films and the Melbourne City Ballet, whose choreographer, Jasmine Kyle, worked with dancer Bilal Zeine to evoke the claustrophobia of a prison cage. \u201cHunted like a bird,\u201d Bandesh sings, \u201cLanguish in a cage, eyes full of tears / Holes in humanity too deep to fill.\u201d It ends with simple longing: \u201cWander around, just be free, just be free.\u201d Bridie\u2019s involvement stemmed from his deep engagement with the music of Papua New Guinea, which predates the arrival of a detention centre on Manus. Bridie\u2019s band Not Drowning, Waving had first travelled to the island to record an album in 1990. \u201cI wanted to collaborate with an Australian musician,\u201d Bandesh says, \u201cand my friend suggested that I contact David Bridie. When I messaged him he really loved the music.\u201d At first, Bridie just wanted to help. \u201cIt was just about getting him some music equipment \u2013 you know, a DAT recorder or a microphone, and then we worked on a song,\u201d Bridie tells Guardian Australia. That first collaboration was on Bandesh\u2019s 2018 release Flee from War, which Bridie calls \u201cmore of a Kurdish punk song\u201d. \u201cHe recorded the vocal on his phone, and the guitar track, and we ended up getting some musicians into my studio here in Melbourne, shooting that and then making a film clip [from it],\u201d Bridie says. The second song is a different offering altogether. \u201cThe Big Exhale is a wonderful title for a song, especially for somebody in his situation. This is very different, it is much more emotive,\u201d Bridie says. \u201cThere\u2019s that big push that happens halfway through the song, that really soars. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he does it, I don\u2019t know how he stays so strong \u2026 But the positive side of it is: if ever art really meant something to the artist, this is it, more so than anything. This is someone who is writing for their life.\u201d Quinsee connected with Bandesh a few years ago through the refugee writers\u2019 collective Writing Through Fences. Quinsee and Bandesh each wrote a poem, which they later combined to create The Big Exhale. \u201cWhen I wrote the lyrics [last year], it\u2019s come to me straight away,\u201d Bandesh said. \u201cStraight away I went and wrote the music, and I thought it\u2019s going to be a beautiful and sad song.\u201d After years of struggling to record music on his phone, Bandesh now has access to some rudimentary recording gear. After the guitar and vocal recordings made their way to Bridie in Melbourne, the Australian mixed the track in his studio, bringing in collaborators including his My Friend the Chocolate Cake bandmate, the violinist Hope Csutorus, whose haunting solo colours the song\u2019s emotional heft. Bandesh says his pain is shared by other detainees. \u201cBecause I am living with them, I am one of them. That\u2019s the hard thing: you think about yourself, and others, you care about yourself, what\u2019s happened to you, and others.\u201d The message of his song is simple, but powerful. \u201cThe things we really need is really simple things: just be free. Like other people, like everyone, that\u2019s our right.\u201d \u201cSix years is enough, it\u2019s too much.\u201d \u2022 The Big Exhale is released through Wantok Musik. The song can be purchased on Bandcamp, with all proceeds raised going to support Farhad Bandesh\u2019s future \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.
