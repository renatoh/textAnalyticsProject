It transpired that Pacenza had not been looking hot under the collar at work because he was charged with energy about his latest computer chip project, but because he had been regularly visiting internet sex sites and titillating chat rooms. But when IBM fired him, Pacenza decided to sue the company for \u00a32.5m. He claims that he is a sex addict and internet addict, who should have been shown sympathy rather than the door. As a Vietnam veteran, he says he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and that he visits internet sex sites as \"a form of self-medication\". At first glance, the case brings to mind three words - only in America. \"But a similar claim is entirely possible in the UK,\" says Richard Kenyon, a partner at the law firm Field Fisher Waterhouse. \"We recently dealt with a case that involved an individual claiming his disability was an obsessive compulsive disorder that compelled him to repeatedly access pornography at work. Ultimately the claim was withdrawn, but not before the parties had gone some way towards preparing the case for hearing and obtaining medical evidence.\" Counting on a get-out excuse for accessing porn is a risky business. \"Many employers are now savvy enough to have clear internet policies, which clearly state that accessing pornography will lead to instant dismissal,\" says Kenyon. \"And even where no written policy exists, tribunals will often adopt the attitude that 'it was bloody obvious you shouldn't have been looking at porn at work.'\" In fact, a harder line is being taken than ever before. So, next time you or your colleagues decide to send a vaguely sexually oriented email, visit a mildly pornographic website or enter a remotely dodgy chatroom, you could be risking your job, says Paul Scholey, head of employment law at Morrish &amp; Co. \"A lot has changed in the last five years and what might have been considered as fairly harmless back then - mild nudity, for instance - is now considered unacceptable.\" Ignoring arguments about whether or not pornography is acceptable, workplaces are now adopting a zero-tolerance approach - in part due to worries that they will face claims from disgruntled employees who say that they feel sexually harassed as a result of the images and words their colleagues view online. There are also issues around time-wasting, the reputation of the company and the fact that - depending on the nature of the material - accessing it may be a criminal offence. In the knowledge that employment tribunals are likely to back them up, many employers - particularly the larger ones - are bypassing a slap on the wrist wherever possible and going straight to sacking staff. Last June, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) dismissed 14 staff, who sent so many pornographic emails outside the office that it affected the agency's mainframe computer. A further 101 employees, who were involved in the emails being sent within the building, were given varying degrees of reprimand, including final warnings. Employment law experts believe such cases could prove to be the tip of the iceberg in coming years. Indeed, a survey last year by the law firm Betesh Fox found that 9 million men and 1.5 million women in the UK had visited pornographic websites, with many doing so from work. Figures from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) back up the extent of the problem, finding that 70% of UK organisations have disciplined staff over pornographic images. Workers at large companies are much more likely to take liberties with workplace internet and email services. More than half of large companies, surveyed by the Department of Trade and Industry last year, say employees misuse the internet at work and that almost half of the worst incidents involved staff accessing inappropriate websites. Little wonder then, that many employers now routinely block access to certain websites and keep tabs on their workers via CCTV and email monitoring. Some even use software packages specifically designed to spot, for example, when staff are accessing pictures of naked flesh. Although employers have a duty to inform you if they are monitoring you in any way, says Ben Willmott, an employee relations adviser at the CIPD, if you are caught out, do not expect to win any fight against them. \"It's back to the fact that tribunals are unlikely to be sympathetic about inappropriate material being viewed at work,\" he says. \"The message is clear - err on the side of caution, even if it seems like a harmless email.\" But what about employees who say they are genuinely addicted to sex? Lisa Matthewman, a chartered psychologist at the University of Westminster, says that sex addicts are particularly likely to have their temptation fuelled at work. \"We're at work more hours than ever before, and at work, the internet is a constantly available outlet.\" Matthewman believes employers should be more sympathetic. \"Since many employers offer to help employees who are addicted to drugs or alcohol, why not give the same treatment to those addicted to sex or the internet?\" she says. Stephen Tame argues that it was his workplace that turned him into a sex addict in the first place. He recently won a case against his employer after claiming that a head injury at work stripped him of his sexual inhibitions and is wrecking his marriage as a result of him having to use pornography and prostitutes. And where did that happen? Not in America, but in Suffolk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
