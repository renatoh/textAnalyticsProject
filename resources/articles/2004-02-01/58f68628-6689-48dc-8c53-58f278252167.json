Tour operators are now offering holidays to Pakistan following a change of FCO advice last month which has dissuaded travellers for the past three years. The change follows peace talks between India and Pakistan, which could quell civil unrest and reduce the risk of terrorism. However, there are still risks in many areas, and visitors are warned to be very careful about personal security. The FCO website states: 'There is a serious threat from terrorism throughout Pakistan. British nationals of Western origin are particularly likely to be targetted by terrorists including for kidnap.' It continues to advise against all non-essential travel to northern and western Baluchistan, western North-West Frontier Province, rural Sindh and border areas. But tour operators say that following the changed advice, Karakoram, a continuation of the 1,500-mile crescent of the Greater Himalaya, is among the regions remote enough to guarantee safe travel. Travellers are, though, told to be aware of the dangers; trekkers with KE Adventure Travel (0176 8773 966) are told not to venture out too much while in Islamabad, where they fly to. Glen Rowley, managing director of KE Adventure Travel, said: 'We've been holding out to go back in since 2000 which was our last year of sending trips there. We feel it's totally safe or we wouldn't send people.' His was the first company to operate tours to the region, back in 1984. Yasin Zargar, managing director of Indus (020 8901 7320) was equally positive: 'Two countries are talking peace for a 50-year ailment, so if it works it's a great thing.' The company can tailor-make holidays in Pakistan to customer demand, and offers combined India-Pakistan breaks now rail and air links between the countries have resumed. The change in advice means trekkers can celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first ascent of K2, the second highest mountain in the world at 28,256ft. It was first conquered by an Italian expedition in 1954. Himalayan Kingdoms (0845 330 8579) is to run two 25-day trips this year, following the same route the original explorers took across the Baltoro glacier, but taking in the Gondogoro La peak too. 'We are thrilled to bits, our insurance people are happy, so there's no reason not to go,' said managing director Steve Berry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
