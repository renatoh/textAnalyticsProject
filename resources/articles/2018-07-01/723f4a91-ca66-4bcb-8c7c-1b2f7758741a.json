The move by Hudson\u2019s Bay \u2013 a chain that describes itself as \u201cCanada\u2019s iconic department store\u201d \u2013 comes after more than a year of consumer pressure, including demonstrations organised by a group calling themselves the \u201cPeeved Beavers\u201d. In a statement to the Guardian, the retailer noted that the change would roll out gradually. \u201cHudson\u2019s Bay is phasing out this brand through the fall based on its performance,\u201d it said. \u201cAs part of our regular course of business, we review our merchandise offerings and make appropriate changes.\u201d A source familiar with the matter said the retailer, which has long offered everything from Ivanka Trump shoes to clothing and jewelry, notified the brand of their decision in the fall of 2017. News of the change was first announced by those behind a campaign to boycott companies with ties to the Trump family. Known as #GrabYourWallet, the movement was launched after the leak of the infamous Access Hollywood tape, in which Donald Trump talks about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy,\u201d in 2016. On Friday, Shannon Coulter, the co-founder of #GrabYourWallet, said the Bay had been removed from the boycott list and joining 39 other companies that have been taken off the list since the campaign was launched. The Canadian retailer\u2019s decision comes 18 months after Nordstrom announced they would no longer carry the Ivanka Trump line, citing poor sales. The Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, which also owns stores such as Lord &amp; Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue, noted the change would only affect Hudson\u2019s Bay stores in Canada. \u201cEach banner makes decisions on its individual merchandise assortment based on brand performance,\u201d it noted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
