He was asked about it after the Conservatives released a briefing saying that a Tory budget in February would \u201ccut taxes for hardworking families\u201d. When reporters put it to him that the overall tax burden was set to rise in the first Tory budget according to CCHQ\u2019s own figures (mostly because a corporation tax cut has been abandoned, and that counts as a tax rise), Johnson claimed not to be aware of this. He told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: \u201cWe\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes.\u201d It would have been reasonable to say there is a difference between personal taxes going down and the overall taxes going up. But he did not, and instead he implied the journalists were wrong. Later, the Conservative party had to issue what amounted to a clarification \u2013 always a sign that a media appearance has not gone smoothly. PM declines to do pre-election interviews Johnson has refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil. Asked about this at his Q&amp;A, he did not say he would refuse to do the interview, but he gave the strong impression that it is never going to happen. It later emerged that he won\u2019t do a sit-down interview with ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham either. Jeremy Corbyn has given interviews to both Neil and Etchingham \u2013 although both generated multiple negative headlines, which of course explains why Johnson is evading this level of scrutiny. Brexit party MEPs go rogue Four Brexit party MEPs said they are leaving the party and urged people to vote Conservative. They are Annunziata Rees-Mogg (whose brother Jacob is a Conservative cabinet minister), Lance Forman, Lucy Harris and John Longworth. They worry that by continuing to stand in Tory target seats, Nigel Farage\u2019s party could be helping Labour. In November, Farage said he would not put up candidates in the 317 Tory-held seats because he was worried about a minority Labour government cancelling Brexit, and the rebel \u201cgang of four\u201d argued that backing the Tories everywhere was the logical extension. Farage has rejected this, claiming there are seats where the Brexit party is helping the Tories by standing. Students of Farage\u2019s career will recall that the last party he led, Ukip, also ended up riven by splits. Meanwhile Johnson has insisted he will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year \u2013 but refused to give a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to that effect. In an interview on Thursday morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit happening at the end of 2020, although he said the prospect was \u201cextremely remote\u201d. Johnson has apologised \u201cfor any offence caused\u201d by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s investigation into the issue. Labour\u2019s Jon Ashworth has pulled out of the final pre-election episode of BBC Question Time, after the programme was criticised for featuring an all-male panel.
