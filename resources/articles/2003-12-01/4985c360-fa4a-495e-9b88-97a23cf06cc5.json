He had provided a written character reference for Rio Ferdinand, but the disciplinary commission might as well have been unaware of the England coach's existence as it handed the centre-back an eight-month ban. Eriksson should laugh in his dry manner at the supposition that he is a powerful figure. The FA had previously displayed no compunction about excising Ferdinand's name from the squad list for the match in Turkey and they were just as ready to reverse the call-up of Alan Smith to the party for the friendly with Denmark upon learning that he had been arrested, without being charged, earlier that day. The coach makes the most polite of rebels, but his antagonism is deepening all the same. The FA, setting a limit to their provocation of this valuable employee, tolerated the fact that he has positioned himself sympathetically close to an indignant England squad. Now, however, that understanding may no longer be sufficient to keep the peace between Eriksson and the ruling body. There are two interlocking areas of concern for the coach. His prospects on the field are being weakened because the confusions and delays of the FA's outmoded disciplinary system are undermining him. The plain football concerns are grave enough. Not so long ago, there was a popular belief that England could well do without Ferdinand. The sight of John Terry floundering miserably for Chelsea in this week's Carling Cup defeat by Aston Villa has, however, shaken the assumption that there is a ready-made replacement at hand. The continuing injury problems of Jonathan Woodagte at Newcastle United are conspiring to rule out another candidate. While Matthew Upson has made a number of appearances for Eriksson he is yet to prove that he is a defender of international calibre. England could turn again to the veteran Gareth Southgate, but even the pragmatic coach would be reluctant to repose his faith in a man who has characterised him as an uninspiring coach. Eriksson, in any case, has taken every opportunity to remind pundits that Ferdinand and Sol Campbell were rated the best defensive partnership at the 2002 World Cup finals. The Swede has always tempered his optimism over Euro 2004 with the observation that his strongest line-up is essential to making a real challenge for the trophy in Portugal. The resources are more slender than he would wish. That truth was underlined by the injuries that undermined England in Japan. Now a valuable performer is being taken from him in circumstances that will strike the coach as bizarre. He sees a player who, 36 hours late, passed a drugs test being made an example of, to a degree never experienced by footballers around the world who had indisputably taken illegal substances. Eriksson will feel ignored and isolated, even if he has a remote understanding of the factors weighing on the FA chief executive Mark Palios. The coach could conclude that his working environment is intolerable even if no one has made it so on purpose. The Swede has always heard the call of the club scene and now it is louder than ever in his ears. A salary of well over \u00a33m a year at Chelsea must assume even greater attractiveness. It would be wise of Palios not to ask the Swede this week what he thinks about the contract extension that the FA recently offered him. Four to fill Rio's shoes John Terry The man in possession, having been the only player to play every minute of England's competitive internationals this season. Matthew Upson The former Arsenal defender has contributed to a miserly defence at Birmingham but, despite his six England caps, doubts remain about him at the highest level. Jonathan Woodgate The Newcastle man is widely regarded as one of the country's best prospects but must overcome persistent injury problems. Anthony Gardner The outsider of the bunch but was picked for the last England squad despite featuring in Tottenham's unsteady rearguard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
