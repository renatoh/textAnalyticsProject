We endured them as children and, by golly, future generations shall endure them too. It's character-building. The same could be said of our tourist attractions. As a new book points out, Britain excels at crap days out. But if we eschew for a moment the national pastime of self-deprecation, it's easy to take pride in our island's astonishing variety and splendour. Castles on volcanic redoubts, petrified forests uncovered by the tides, wind-sculpted tors on haunted moorland, peregrines hunting from museum chimneys, bridges slung like webs across gorges, hillside orchards, wild deer glimpsed from railway carriages, otters in the becks, Roman walls and Bronze Age burial mounds, Tudor mullions and Victorian stained glass, barges on the Avon, wherries on the Fens, wattle and daub, half-timbers, flying buttresses, lakeland and heathland and lochs and dunes and dales and mountains. It's Britain and it's ours. And we can all be proud of that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
