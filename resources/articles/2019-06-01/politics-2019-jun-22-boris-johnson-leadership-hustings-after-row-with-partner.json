The Guardian revealed that an argument between Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, a former Conservative party head of press, was heard by a neighbour who called the police and recorded the row. They said they heard a woman screaming followed by slamming and banging. At one point Symonds could be heard telling Johnson to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d. As Johnson prepared to go head-to-head with Jeremy Hunt in Birmingham for the role of Conservative leader, in the first runoff hustings on Saturday, questions over his private life dominated the battle for Downing Street. Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he wasn\u2019t in a position to comment on the specifics of the story but when asked a more general question, said character mattered in the leadership race. \u201cIt will be relevant and it has to be relevant \u2026 but we have to be careful about what aspects of character really matter. Clearly reliability and honesty are important things.\u201d Speaking on the programme, Sonia Purnell, an author of a critical biography of the Tory politician called Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, who has worked by him, said knowing his character was important. She said: \u201cWe have a right to know what the character of our future prime minister is like, imagine that job\u2026 that is an unbelievably pressured job \u2026 You have to have an equilibrium, a clear head and stability to cope with that.\u201d Others, however, have sprung to the defence of the leadership hopeful. Daily Telegraph journalist Allison Pearson said: \u201cWhat right do we have to listen in to a private lovers\u2019 tiff?\u201d She told the Today programme: \u201cThe Tory members won\u2019t care about this. They\u2019ve been waiting since 2016 to vote for Boris Johnson.\u201d In a tweet, security minister Ben Wallace, who is a close ally of Johnson, said: \u201cWhat a non-story, \u2018couple have row\u2019. Lefty neighbours give recording to Guardian. Newspaper reaches new low is a better news story.\u201d The tweet was later deleted. Tim Sinclair, a member of the Stratford-on-Avon Conservatives and a candidate in recent local elections, said he expects the incident will \u201cpuff up and blow away\u201d. \u201cI suspect that this isn\u2019t going to be a good story for him, he wouldn\u2019t have ideally wanted it,\u201d he told BBC Newsnight. \u201cHowever, ironically despite his background, he\u2019s actually regarded as a man of the people purely because he acts normally \u2013 he speaks his mind, he does things and behaves in ways that normal people can look at.\u201d When contacted by the Guardian on Friday, police initially said they had no record of a domestic incident at the address. However, after they received the case number and reference number, as well as identification markings of the vehicles that were called out, they issued a statement saying: \u201cPolice attended and spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well. There were no offences or concerns apparent to the officers and there was no cause for police action,\u201d a spokesperson said. Johnson\u2019s office was contacted earlier on Friday for comment but had still not responded by the time of publication."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
