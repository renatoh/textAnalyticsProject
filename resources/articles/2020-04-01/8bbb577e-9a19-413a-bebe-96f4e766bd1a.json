His Great British Bake Off co-judge recently went to Cambodia to make Prue Leith: Journey With My Daughter, a deeply personal study of family bonds, requiring unsparing self-reflection. Paul\u2019s development meeting at Channel 4 HQ must have gone rather differently, because his own sabbatical was much more in the \u201cgo on a jolly, but bring a camera crew\u201d vein. This is Paul\u2019s first trip to Japan, we are told, but it certainly isn\u2019t the first one we have seen on television. Recent shows such as Japan With Sue Perkins and Joanna Lumley\u2019s Japan have ensured that we sofa-bound travellers are familiar with these \u201cexotic\u201d surroundings. Karaoke joints? Been there. Shibuya Crossing? Seen it. Novelty cat cafes? Over it. Paul swung by all of them in this first episode of three, but his food focus made it fresh \u2013 though not as fresh as the red sea bream sashimi caught direct from the tableside stream at Zauo Fishing restaurant. Japan\u2019s incredibly rich food culture and hugely varied regional cuisines are rarely done justice by British travelogues. Perhaps Paul was hoping to exemplify the resulting ignorance when he proclaimed: \u201cIt\u2019s all about rice and noodles, isn\u2019t it?\u201d If so, he took it a little far with his continued insistence that cake and bread simply doesn\u2019t exist east of India. How is it plausible that an internationally successful baking expert could believe that? I have never been to Japan either, but I have had a dorayaki pancake at Yo! Sushi. Someone else irked by Paul\u2019s apparent cluelessness was his guide, the local comedian Kilara Sen. She took him to a traditional tempura restaurant in Tokyo\u2019s Shinjuku neighbourhood, where they ordered omakase, or chef\u2019s choice, and she repeatedly chastised him for poor chopstick etiquette. So began Hollywood\u2019s most entertaining screen partnership to date. It\u2019s just fun to see him on the other end of a stern look for a change. If only Kilara had been lead presenter on the whole show. Paul could have sat slurping his noodles appreciatively, while she taught vocabulary from the \u201ceating out\u201d section of the phrasebook direct to camera, and explained the Japanese culinary tradition of specialisation. Chefs such as Kuwata San at Tempura Tsunahachi study for decades until they become a master, or shokunin, of their chosen discipline. That would have at least spared us Paul\u2019s \u201ceel-y good\u201d pun. \u201cOh! Is it a British joke?\u201d said Kilara by way of rimshot. She\u2019s deadly. All too soon, though, we had to wave goodbye to Kilara. She is only the first in a series of \u201ctravel companions\u201d whom Paul hooks up with over the series. That is in addition to the gently sarcastic voiceover narration provided by Rebecca Front (with an obvious debt to Maria McErlane\u2019s work on Eurotrash). Travel companions are necessary because \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 Paul is your classic TV straight man. Those brilliant blues don\u2019t just start twinkling on their own. In the absence of Noel Fielding in a novelty jumper, food can provide the necessary stimulus. There is lots here that is mind-boggling, mouthwatering or both, including the Japanese tradition of eating KFC on Christmas Day, a \u00a3350 strawberry and a fast-food chain that serves burger patties on sushi rice buns. Many of the episode\u2019s most interesting moments took place when Paul\u2019s mouth was stuffed full of some delicious delicacy, leaving someone else to do the talking. Even when it was his turn to be shokunin, in the familiar territory of a high-end bakery, he seemed confounded by Japanese diligence. As he adopted the judging stance and extended his little finger towards a perfectly positioned raisin in a perfectly shiny scone, he marvelled: \u201cI\u2019m in Tokyo, I\u2019m eating something that comes straight from the Queen\u2019s afternoon-tea menu! I mean, that is staggering!\u201d Is it though, Paul? Why wouldn\u2019t highly trained chefs be capable of seeking out and following a basic recipe? Even if they don\u2019t have a copy of Paul Hollywood\u2019s British Baking to reference, there is always the internet. Similarly, after hearing about the 10 hours a day that the chef at Nakiryu dedicates to his Michelin-starred ramen broth, was it not rather rude of Paul to subject him to a chicken and mushroom Pot Noodle? Sacrilegious, even. Such idiot-abroad antics might be absolved by Paul\u2019s honest love of the grub, but only if the show stayed on topic. Instead we were invited to stick around as his passion for motoring was indulged with Ninja Turtle-themed go-kart racing. That\u2019s one for the superfans only."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
