Clark and Kellogg have taken over as English national mixed-doubles champions from their great rivals Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms, and outdid the Olympic silver medallists again yesterday with a hard-fought 21-18 21-19 win over surprise survivors from Denmark, Carsten Mogensen and Helle Nielsen. Top-seeded Robertson and Emms, meanwhile, suffered a shock semi-final defeat, losing 14-21 21-10 21-6 to the fourth-seeded Poles Robert Mateusiak and Nadieszka Kostiuczyk in a match that increased doubts about their fitness. Clark, who hurried from his match to watch his room-mate, Robertson, and Emms, said: 'I didn't think they played too badly but the Poles played really well. I fear people are learning to play against them and they had a good strategy. 'Me and Donna have had some shocking draws but it's made us mentally strong.We've not played beautiful badminton but we've ground out results. ' Later Kellogg reached a second European final when she and Emms, the top-seeded women's doubles title holders, beat Sweden's Elin Bergblom and Johanna Persson 21-18 21-7."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
