Mr Grasso's pay is the subject of an unprecedented legal battle waged by New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who argues that his remuneration was far too high for an executive at a not-for-profit organisation. In an early victory for Mr Spitzer, state supreme court judge Charles Ramos published a summary ruling yesterday which requires Mr Grasso to pay back a sizeable chunk of the $100m he accumulated in a pension plan. The judge concluded that the size of the pension plan had not been clear to the stock exchange's board. Legal commentators say the extremely complex ruling requires Mr Grasso to return at least $36m. Judge Ramos's decision was in response to an effort by Mr Grasso to get the charges struck out. Mr Grasso immediately announced he would appeal and the issue is expected to go to a full trial. The prosecution of Mr Grasso is widely viewed as determining whether such a thing exists on Wall Street as excessive pay. A colourful and outspoken character, Mr Grasso joined the NYSE as an $80-a-week clerk in 1968 and worked his way to the top of the organisation, serving as chairman from 1995 to 2003. He steered the exchange through the trauma of the terrorists attacks of September 11 but, by the time of his ignominious departure, he was attracting porcine analogies - the Californian pension fund Calpers described securing his departure as \"trying to pull the pig from the trough\". Yesterday's 70-page court judgment describes the board's lack of knowledge of Mr Grasso's pay arrangements as \"shocking\". \"That a fiduciary of any institution, profit or not-for-profit, could honestly admit that he was unaware of a liability of over $100m, or even over $36m, is a clear violation of the duty of care,\" the judgement says. \"The fact that it was a liability to an insider (chairman and CEO) is even more shocking and a clear violation of the duty of loyalty.\" The ruling describes Mr Grasso's arguments as \"tortured\" in trying to square his pay with regulations surrounding non-profit entities. Critics of Mr Grasso say the stock exchange is more like a utility providing a public service than an investment bank. During Mr Grasso's tenure, it produced a surplus of little more than $28m annually."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
