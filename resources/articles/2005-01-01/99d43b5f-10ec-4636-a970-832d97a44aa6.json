One is to look over at the mountains - in this instance the Matterhorn, Europe's most photographed mountain and one so evocative of its adventurous and British-climbed history. Another is to look towards the future and wonder if the day will come when skiers have to reach higher and higher up the slopes to catch diminishing snows. At present it does not seem likely, but as each summer ends, ski operators, the resorts and skiers themselves surely wonder what the winter skies will bring. Politicians and sceptical scientists in the US may argue that predictions of global warming are based on dodgy maths, or that the temperature rises are part of a natural climatic cycle, but it is sometimes hard to argue with the facts on the ground. Last week in the Swiss resort of Zermatt, a town more than 2,000m lower at the foot of the Matterhorn, that ground was not as snowy as it could have been. With no fresh falls since Boxing Day the pistes were coping well - all 194km of the 70 runs were open - but there were too many exposed rocks to go off-piste and some of the lower slopes leading into the resort itself were becoming worn. Snow has fallen since across the Alps, but January is a knife-edge month if there is not enough cover for the later and busier part of the season. In Zermatt though, such grander climatic concerns can seem distant - this is a resort that boasts summer skiing. The town is cocooned by glaciers and its two big mountains, the Matterhorn and the Breithorn, and the outside world intrudes little. Cars are not allowed so the only way through is on the Zermatt-Davos-St Mortiz Glacier Express (with or without skis, it is a rail journey worth taking). Or you leave your car at the nearby town of T\u00e4sche and ride in on a shuttle train. The result is a remarkably clean and quiet resort. No traffic jams and no churned up slush in the parking bays. Even the air feels cleaner. With pedestrians only bothered by rare electric taxis that - to British eyes at least - look like milk carts, much of the town's history and old-fashioned charm are preserved. Centuries-old wooden huts on stilts, some still used for wintering animals, line narrow streets leading off the main square and classic alpine hotels such as the Zermatterhof and Monte Rosa dominate. It goes without saying that this resort, the kind you can only call a chocolate box, is somewhat moneyed. Shops on the main street look like they shift more watches than you would expect for a place of this size. It was not always this way. Zermatt has been settled for centuries (when the glacier retreats, it sometimes reveals Roman coins from the days imperial armies used the mountain pass) but spent most of its life as an animal grazing and crop growing valley community. Tourism started in the 19th century when the Matterhorn was the last great mountain left to climb in the Alps - it was finally conquered in 1865 when a British party led by Edward Whymper made it to the top. The Matterhorn is now big business in Zermatt, filling roughly the same role the Eiffel Tower plays for Paris. A certain type of Briton will tell you Whymper's climb gave the townspeople an enduring affection for the British. If a rival team from just over the border in Italy had succeeded it would instead be known to the world as Monte Cervino, the Italian name. Whether that still holds true 140 years later - especially when you factor in big-spending Russians - you can find concrete expressions in the Tartan bar in the Monte Rosa hotel where Whymper left from, and the British names in the climber's cemetery. Most of them died making the descent. Where to ski Beginners would be better advised to go elsewhere, but the choice for intermediate and advanced skiers is almost unrivalled. Zermatt's ski area is divided into three zones. First is the Klein Matterhorn towards the mountain, offering superb skiing from a 3,820m high point on a glacier and reliable year-round slopes. You can also leave from here for the Italian resort of Cervinia, which is just on the other side of the peak - just remember to call it Monte Cervino. It does not necessarily have better skiing but is worth a visit for a cheaper - and Italian - lunch. The only downside is that if you miss the last lift back, it is a six hour taxi ride back to Zermatt. It is that or an overnight stay. The combined Zermatt-Cervinia ski area has 129 pistes over 394km. Away from the mountain are the Gornergrat and Sunnegga slopes, accessible by either an underground funicular railway, or a surface-level mountain railway that winds to the top. There is good eating and drinking here too (see below). Worth a visit is the newly-opened igloo bar on Gornergrat, serving mulled wine by candle light in a snow dome lined with furs. Groups or couples can arrange to stay the night. Where to eat Finding a place to eat is not a problem: Zermatt has more than 100 restaurants in the main town and another 30 on the mountain sides. On the Sunnegga slopes, the Fluhalp restaurant, a four-storey chalet, offers traditional Swiss fare such as cold meats and r\u00f6sti from 15-25 francs. Views of the Matterhorn come for free. The Gandeggh\u00fctte is on the Matterhorn side of the slopes so views are less spectacular, but the small alpine cabin - also a mountain hut for those making a 4am start to the climb - makes up for it by feeling like a refuge for intrepid adventurers. You can always reserve a table if risk-taking is really not your thing. In the town itself, restaurants cater for cuisines from fondue to sushi. Recommendations include Mood's for a higher-end experience or Chez Heini for something more traditional. Where to go out If you are used to the average apr\u00e8s ski experience, the Vernissage bar and cinema complex will come as a shock. No snow-clumped boots and schnapps you never wanted here: a curved staircase instead leads down from street level to an arts cinema showing cult movies, mountain movies and world movies. There are also regular live music and club events. At the projectionist's level on the mezzanine floor there is a bar where you can sit back and chat, or just quietly worry that you might be asked to leave. With its dark wood and loft-style features (exposed girders and leather sofas) it is clearly convinced it could out-cool the pistes, but is nevertheless welcoming. More conventional apr\u00c0s ski can be found at the Paperla Pub (which leads downstairs to the Schneewitchen nightclub) and the P\u00f6stli bar in the Hotel Post complex. This is the kind of place where you can drink at the bar in a kilt and no one bats an eyelid. It is also the front - literally - for the four restaurants and four bars/discos that operate tardis-like up and down a series of stairs to its rear. The Pollux T-Bar is a popular nightclub if that is what you are after (though be warned, its motto is \"Let's dance\") and for a truly bank account shattering experience visit Elsie's cocktail bar, a wood-panelled historical hangout just off the main square. One drink should be enough before your wallet is begging you to move on. Where to stay Zermatt's population soars from 5,000 to more than 20,000 in the high season. I stayed with Simply Ski in the Chalet Victoria, a contemporary and stylish building built by the same architect who designed the Vernissage cinema complex.
