England to retain the Ashes but not win them outright unless Brisbane is heavily disrupted by weather And the score? 2-2 unless the first Test is badly affected in which case 2-1 to England Man of the series? Two of them to shine: Stuart Broad and Shane Watson Emerging star? England: Boyd Rankin; Australia: James Faulkner Most looking forward to The end of the tiresome pre-series phoney-war media posturing Least looking forward to Anything that does not involve a close, hard-fought but fair series, well umpired and devoid of DRS controversy or indeed any controversy Glenn McGrath Who will win? Australia. If they can keep Peter Siddle, Ryan Harris and Mitchell Johnson fit then I'm tipping them. If any of those three get injured then I think they'll find it pretty tough. But in terms of the players currently available I think Australia can do it. And the score? I always struggle to say Australia will lose a Test, so I'm not going to go for 2-1 or 3-2. All I'll say is that I think Australia will win at least one more Test than England Man of the series? David Warner has been in great form here, scoring a ton of runs for New South Wales, and I think he'll combine well with Chris Rogers at the top of the order. He could be in for a big series. He and Johnson are key for Australia Emerging star? You can't call Mitchell Johnson an emerging star \u2013 he's got 205 Test wickets after all \u2013 but this could be a re-emergence. It's a bit of a second coming. If England are expecting the old Mitchell Johnson to walk out onto the pitch they're in for a big shock Most looking forward to Seeing Johnson bowling at the England batsmen. And, of course, I'm looking forward to seeing order restored and the urn back in Australian hands Least looking forward to I still think DRS should be taken out of the players' hands \u2013 potentially you can win or lose a Test by how you use it and that's not right. It shouldn't be a weapon. But hopefully we won't see the same sort of controversy as we saw in England Vic Marks Who will win? England will retain the Ashes but it will be a damn close thing, hingeing on their ability to react and perform when the match is in the balance And the score? Was hoping to avoid that \u2026 2-1 to England Man of the series? Kevin Pietersen. The series could be remembered for his magnificent swansong or some crazy KP aberration. Who knows? He remains mesmerising. We had better watch carefully because he may not be around for much longer Emerging star? Most of them are far too old to be emerging stars. So it might be Joe Root. Or David Warner. For the right reasons Most looking forward to The SCG, a magnificent cricketing amphitheatre, jampacked on 7 January with the destination of the Ashes still undecided Least looking forward to The crazy pre\u2011Ashes phoney, full-of-baloney war, which continues right up until the first ball is propelled on Thursday morning. An empty Christmas stocking Andy Wilson Who will win? Dunno. Torn between England offering the most impressive display yet of their resilience, or age catching up with their thirtysomethings against a ferociously determined Australia team And the score? 3-1 either way Man of the series? Stuart Broad. Will relish the abuse and rise to the challenge Emerging stars? George Bailey and Real Time Snicko Most looking forward to Jimmy Anderson to David Warner, Graeme Swann to Michael Clarke Least looking forward to Boring Barmy Army chants, especially about Mitchell Johnson Andy Bull Who will win? England will retain the urn in the first drawn Ashes series in 40 years. Scarred by the experience of suggesting they would win in 2006-07, I'm loth to be any more optimistic than that And the score? 2-2, a scoreline which has occurred only once in Ashes history Man of the series? Kevin Pietersen, who, ahead of his 100th Test, looks and sounds happier and more at ease than he has seemed to be in a long time Emerging star? Joe Root might just find that Australian pitches suit his style of play, especially if he slots in at No6, where he will have a little more protection than he did at the top of the order Most looking forward to Watching Pietersen take on Australia's quicks. Judging by his tussles with assorted Australian journalists in the run-up, he's in the mood for a scrap Least looking forward to Interminable debates about the rights and wrongs of DRS between people who haven't read the playing conditions and so don't understand how it is supposed to work"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
