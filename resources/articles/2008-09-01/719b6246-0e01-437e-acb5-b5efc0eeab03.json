He is in charge of a national team for the first time and holds that position in a country where he had not worked before, while picking up a salary whose magnitude was presumably unfamiliar even to him. With a managerial CV hitherto confined to Milan, Real Madrid, Roma and Juventus, he now breaks new ground by guiding a side with good cause to be uncertain of its standing. His mission starts in earnest tonight. It would be nonsensical to suppose that defeat against Croatia will doom him as an England manager. In theory, after all, this is the most daunting fixture that will be presented to him until the 2010 World Cup, should the team get there. The result, however, must shape perceptions of him and, if the worst comes to the worst, a reputation constructed over decades will be defaced, temporarily at least. There is more at stake than his vanity. The squad needs reason to believe that they are in the hands of a manager who will lead them to an eminent place in international football. The negotiations over this fixture saw Croatia allowing England to have the away match first in return for it taking place in the opening days of the programme. Slaven Bilic's calculation is that Capello has not had sufficient time to re-engineer the team. The Fifa rankings look quite sensible, with Croatia, in fifth, squinting at England 10 places below them. This evening's match at the Maksimir Stadium may be a challenge, but it also invites Capello to confound Bilic. The country remembers all too well the defeats inflicted on Steve McClaren in this fixture and the first significant evaluation of his successor will be made through a comparison. Capello is sure to be lionised if he engineers a day of reckoning for Bilic. Croatia do hold that undefeated record in competitive matches in Zagreb reaching back to 1994. The statistic nudges a rival coach towards picking an iron-clad line-up and Capello, in any case, is never known to be fanciful, but it would be shallow to think solely of resistance. These opponents would best be deterred by making them worry about England now and again. A country of 4.5 million people does not furnish a coach with excellent players in peak form for every position. It is notable that the Kovac brothers and Josip Simunic are all expected to occupy their accustomed defensive roles tonight despite the fact that each is on the fringes of his squad at club level. The holding midfielder Niko Kovac, 37 next month, announced that he was stepping down from the national team after Euro 2008. So quickly did Bilic talk him out of it that the veteran's retirement felt almost subliminal. That change of heart confirmed the fellowship between a manager and squad who keep on bucking the odds. This adventure is highly charged and even volatile. At Euro 2008 Croatia went ahead against Turkey in the 29th minute of extra-time and Bilic was part of a pitch invasion by the coaching staff. Order was never quite restored in the minds of a side who then conceded an equaliser before losing the quarter-final in a shoot-out. There was an insight there both into how much Croatia invest in these occasions and how much it takes out of them. In Zagreb, with the help of a remarkable home crowd, they usually come out ahead. Capello has to make unease seep into those spectators and that probably cannot be achieved by resistance alone. He would best deter Croatia by surprising them. So loquacious was the manager on the topic of Theo Walcott that cynics concluded Capello must really have no intention of sending him out against Croatia. However, the youngster does have a destabilising pace that no one else offers for England. That consideration has brought a realistic prospect of Walcott playing from the start. Those who have followed Capello's career struggle to remember a key fixture in which he opted for an emerging player who had never started in a top-level occasion for club or county. Then again, there is a rational calculation that the opposition, at their core, have men who could dread being exposed to speed. It is feasible that Walcott and Joe Cole will be deployed in support of Wayne Rooney, even if the Manchester United player would then have the lone striker duties that do not suit him. Should Walcott be chosen, he will be obliged to track back and cover as, say, Danijel Pranjic and Ivan Rakitic spring into attack on his wing in a bid to exploit his callowness. David Beckham, should he be on the right of three in midfield, will have to be assiduous in his defensive work. The overall ambition must be to make Croatia pause and review their strategy. Like many modern sides who excite us, Bilic's line-up flourishes on the counter-attack. The Czech Republic, who deserved better than a 2-2 draw in last month's friendly at Wembley, disturbed Capello by undoing England repeatedly on the break. Judging by Luka Modric's exuberance in the 3-0 defeat of Kazakhstan at the weekend, Gareth Barry and others will need to have been schooled in stifling the Tottenham Hotspur player. There cannot be a flying start for Capello unless Croatia are brought to a standstill. Croatia decoded: how they triumphed before Croatia 2 England 0 October 11 2006 4-1-3-2 European Championship qualifier Niko Kovac was deployed as a defensive midfielder, allowing Luka Modric the freedom to drift forward. With Niko Kranjcar he was the outstanding player in Croatia's line-up. But Slaven Bilic was most delighted by England's decision to play five in midfield, which he took as an indication of their defensive outlook. They would, he said later, have been more comfortable in a familiar 4-4-2, to which they reverted when 2-0 down. England 2 Croatia 3 November 21 2007 4-4-2 European Championship qualifier A similar line-up again got the better of a much-changed England side. Steve McClaren's nervousness was evident in his selection, with only one striker in his starting XI. Again a more familiar formation was found when the match appeared lost. Luka Modric was the outstanding player - Gareth Barry, a lone shield in front of England's back four, was unable to contain Croatia's attacking midfielders and Dario Srna embarrassed Wayne Bridge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
