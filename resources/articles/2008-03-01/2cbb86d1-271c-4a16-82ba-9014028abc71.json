I can't help feeling that England's best moments in this series [insert your own gag here] have taken place after I've gone to bed: first Ryan Sidebottom's hat-trick at Hamilton, and now Tim Ambrose's joyous progress to 97 not out last night. So I'd just like to say that if things go belly-up for England in the first two sessions today, fear not: Andy Bull will be here from tea-time onwards to bring you news of their inevitable revival. In the meantime, the stage is set for England to post the kind of first-innings score that allows a team some precious breathing-space. If Paul Collingwood (48 not out) and Ambrose can extend a sixth-wicket partnership already worth 155 by another 50 or so, life really will look promising for Michael Vaughan. But - and didn't you just know there'd be a caveat - the tail remains vulnerable, for all the youthful promise of Stuart Broad at No8. A quick wicket and England could easily be all out for 330. And that might not be enough. Sky have just shown last night's final over from the magnificent Jacob Oram to Ambrose. The scorebook will record a maiden, but Ambrose was beaten four times outside off-stump and later explained that he wanted to reach his hundred before the close not just for himself but for the crowd too. Superb! England centuries have been few and far between of late. Alastair Cook got one at Galle - the only one during the Sri Lanka series - but they have managed just three in their last 10 Tests. Only Bangladesh and Zimbabwe have scored fewer over the same period. I can't help feeling that the malaise which seems to have gripped England's top six (too much blather about their 40-plus averages?) has not yet infected the newcomer. Yes, it's only three runs, but how symbolic those three runs might be. \"Beefy thinks England can win this game, which is no great surprise. If, he stresses, England bowl well. Hmm. An email! \"Two-one to England in sessions, yesterday and I trust that waking up to this news raised your spirits and lifted the fug of your cold this morning,\" says Mat Wrigley, pausing only to top up his rum punch. \"We should definitely be aiming for a similar result today, with one of those two ideally being the first session. Unfortunately, I feel it's a big ask, however...\" The cold's still here, Mat, but the Lemsips-per-day calculation is falling all the time. Weather update from the OBO's Wellington spies \"Am writing from the Terrace in Wellington,\" cackles Sally McKechnie. \"I'm looking towards the south and towards the Basin, the clouds are gathering. And it is suspiciously warm for Wellington. Might not stop Ambrose's hundred but Lord knows what it will do to the ball in flight. Bring it on.\" A prediction I like the taste of egg on my face, so I'll say now that England will be bowled out for 387. You read it here first. Hey, another email! \"I'm loving the Guardian's coverage of this series,\" says Edmund King in New Zealand. \"And well done to Tim Ambrose. Damn him. I guess what Ambrose's performance does is bring home a couple of enduring truths about NZ cricket, which England's lemming-like first-Test performance obscured. 1) NZ cannot perform consistently in any two Tests to save its life. 2) Mills and Martin aren't an international-quality opening partnership. And 3) NZ still can't seem to bowl properly to Australian wicketkeeper/batsman. There is absolutely no reason, based on the evidence of the last session, why England can't go on to 450 from here.\" You obviously haven't been watching England recently, Eddie... I wonder how nervous Tim Ambrose is feeling right now? We're two minutes away from bully-off. 91st over: England 291-5 (Collingwood 48, Ambrose 97) Right, here goes. It's Kyle Mills to Paul Collingwood, who needs two runs to bring up a hard-fought half-century and is squared by the first ball of the day, which he edges along the ground to second slip. He misses out on a couple of leg-stumpish deliveries, but he hasn't got where he is at the moment by worrying too much about things like dot balls. A maiden. \"Nice muggy atmosphere building up,\" says Peter Thornbury in Wellington. \"Should help swing (wonder if England will regret dropping Hoggard). Break this partnership and the rest will crumble. A cool southerly is building (I'm looking south too) that will drop the temp and bring a bit of rain by the looks of it. Should be a good day - thanks to all the Pom spectators who are making the match so much more interesting. Wish I was there...\" You and me both, Peter. You and me both. 92nd over: England 291-5 (Collingwood 48, Ambrose 97) Oram to Ambrose - wouldn't you know it? - and he's beaten by the third ball, much in the way he was beaten by a couple of Oram's bouncier deliveries last night. And then the fourth ball flies past the outside edge too. It looks as if Oram has not lost any sharpness overnight. The fifth ball brings an optimistic shout for lbw, but that was way too high and umpire Steve Davis is having none of it. Another maiden. \"Evening, Lawrence,\" says Ian Copestake. \"I can only imagine what sort of sleep one can have while contemplating such a landmark, but hopefully Ambrose, being a modern player, has been so distracted by Playstations and online role-playing games, that he has completely forgotten that he has to bat again.\" 93rd over: England 295-5 (Collingwood 52, Ambrose 97) And there's Collingwood's fifty, courtesy of an Ambrose-style slash for four behind point as Mills gives him a bit of width. It's taken him just over three hours and has been the quintessential second fiddle. Now, can Ambrose do it in this next over against Oram...? \"Good morning from Sydney, Lawrence,\" says a very chirpy-sounding Sean Boiling. \"I'll second your motion for 387 all out. Shall we put it to a vote?\" 94th over: England 300-5 (Collingwood 52, Ambrose 102) He can! OK, so it took an involuntary edge just wide of second slip, but he'll take that. He needed just 144 balls for his maiden Test hundred in only his second match and England's decision to pick him ahead of Phil Mustard, not to mention Matt Prior, is looking like a masterstroke. Oram retaliates with another bat-passing beauty, before Ambrose brings up the 300 with a single to third man, where Daniel Vettori has now posted a fielder. \"Is Oram the new Curtly?\" asks Gary Naylor. \"OK, not as quick and not as likely to take 7 for 11 or whatever, but the same probing on the line of the fourth stump, each delivery propelled from a great height. And a second-rate Curtly is still a first-class bowler.\" WICKET! Ambrose c Taylor b Mills 102 (300-6) Well, I guess his luck outside off-stump had to end sooner or later. Ambrose finally nicks one - but not off Oram - and Ross Taylor takes the catch at second slip. That's massive for New Zealand: England's long tail starts now. \"That was surely a more meaningful hundred than the joke one Prior got on debut against the Windies,\" suggests Andrew Stroud, although I don't remember anyone denigrating Prior's efforts at the time. \"He came in when we were in real trouble, rather than sitting pretty on a tasty lead. And he looks like a better keeper too. Whisper it gently, but could he be the one we've been looking for?\" 95th over: England 300-6 (Collingwood 52, Broad 0) That was a stand of 164 in just 44 overs between Collingwood and Ambrose: an innings-turning liaison if ever there was one. But England can still slip to 330 all out quite easily - there is movement in this 'ere pitch. A wicket maiden. Now Collingwood has to take control. 96th over: England 302-6 (Collingwood 54, Broad 0) Oram has done nothing to suggest he wasn't injected with Richard Hadlee's DNA before the start of this series, although Collingwood manages his second scoring shot of the day with a tuck through square-leg for two. \"Jesus!\" says a voice out in the middle, but I'm not sure who. Oram because Mark Gillespie allowed the batsmen a second? Broad because he had to scamper? Matthew Hayden because he fancied a quick prayer? Eh? Oh. \"Unlucky Ambers,\" says Andrew Stroud. \"And, while a tad harsh, he should surely now be dropped for failing to go on and make a big ton. That'll teach the upstart.\" 97th over: England 304-6 (Collingwood 55, Broad 1) Broad gets off the mark with a single off his hip as Mills drops slightly short. He has a big chance to impress himself on this No8 role now. England desperately need a bridge between the wicket-keeper and the rabbits and Broad might just be the man. Of course, he's going to have to bowl a few overs as well, but don't forget that he started life as a batsman. And it's in the genes too. Meanwhile, Collingwood keeps the strike with a nudge to long-leg for a single. \"So, this Ambrose chap, eh?\" says Ian Taylor. \"Commendably anonymous behind the stumps, a half-century in his first match and now a century (in the first innings!) of his second. Such a display of talent is ridiculous. Clearly he doesn't understand what's required to play Test-match cricket for England. Ship him out post haste, I say.\" WICKET! Broad b Oram 1 (305-7) That'll teach me. Broad is bowled round his legs in frankly unfortunate fashion after the ball gets caught in his thigh pad and dribbles onto leg-stump. The collapse is on. \"Does anyone else think that Michael Vaughan will sporting the combover in five years' time?\" asks Marv Quinn. \"There's something dodgy going on with that coif if I'm any judge...\" I worry every time I see him ruffle his hair on his way back to the pavilion, Marv. Each dismissal brings forward the onset of the combover by a week. 98th over: England 306-7 (Collingwood 56, Sidebottom 1) Perhaps 330 was optimistic. But this pitch is helping the seamers. Ryan Sidebottom opens his account with a quick single into the off-side off the superb Oram. 99th over: England 307-7 (Collingwood 56, Sidebottom 2) Mills forces evasive action from Sidebottom, who gets the shoulder of his bat in the way of one that was threatening to part his perm. (Note to Sidebottom's hairdresser: I know it's not a perm, and I know he's wearing a helmet, but the alliteration was just too tempting.) Beefy is still raging about \"that pathetic performance in Hamilton\" and Bumble has to calm him down. Sidebottom keeps the strike again with a push into the covers. \"So if you're out by tea, does that make Andy Bull the nightwatchman?\" asks Dennis O'Neill. \"And if you're out with such regularity and predictability, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in whites out there with the rest of them?\" I... er... 100th over: England 312-7 (Collingwood 59, Sidebottom 4) Sensible stuff from Sidebottom, who drops Oram's first ball into the covers and picks up another single. Collingwood returns the favour with a leg-side nudge for one more, before Sidebottom deflects a single to long-leg. I think he'll bowl well on this pitch. I think Hoggard would have bowled well on it too. Collingwood completes the over with a push through point for two. Always said Oram was a flash in the pan. \"Surely Vaughan will follow Warne and Gooch in promoting a revolutionary hair replacement service?\" says Dominic O'Reilly. \"I remember him saying he discussed hair gel with Trescothick at the crease. Which loss hurt him more - his opening partner and vice-captain or his thatch?\" 101st over: England 318-7 (Collingwood 59, Sidebottom 6) England collect four leg-byes as Sidebottom gets an unspecified part of his body on a loose one from Mills and watches it dribble to the fine-leg rope. He then hooks him for two, before missing a hook at the next ball. \"Do you think this is getting quicker?\" wonders Bumble. \"It might be,\" intones Beefy. \"Michael Vaughan is with evey passing day morphing into Brian Close, as you can see,\" chuckles Lee Calvert. 102nd over: England 324-7 (Collingwood 64, Sidebottom 7) Collingwood starts another Oram over with a characteristic work to wide mid-on for an easy single: he does bat well with the tail. Sidebottom responds with a single squirted behind point - surely there were two there? But then Collingwood reveals the reason for the dithering running with a coruscating pull for four. Shot! \"Hadlee's DNA would technically have to have been 'spliced' rather than merely 'injected',\" points out Victoria Brown. \"God, don't you just hate a biology pedant. I'll get me coat.\" 103rd over: England 330-7 (Collingwood 64, Sidebottom 13) The first bowling change of the morning and it's Mark Gillespie for Mills, who took one for nine in six overs. His first ball is short... and Sidebottom pulls for four! What a great shot! England look so much better when they attack. And then Sidebottom picks up two with a drive through extra-cover: that's the 330 I nominated earlier as the worst-case scenario. In between times, Gillespie passes the outside edge, but so he should: this is a No9 who'd be more at home batting at No10. And to back that up, Sidebottom is dropped at mid-on by Martin, whose forward dive was rather lame. \"So, the pitch is helping the seamers then?\" asks Tom Hopkins. \"That would be better news if we hadn't dropped our best one, don't you think?\" I do, yes. Very much. 104th over: England 335-7 (Collingwood 66, Sidebottom 13) Collingwood is ticking along nicely and works Oram for another leg-side single, and there's four more to the total as Oram loses his line and Sidebottom collects four leg-byes to long leg. At what stage will New Zealand begin to feel seriously agitated? They stuck England in, don't forget. And here comes the drinks. England will be happy with this after slipping to 305 for seven. But we end the over with a self-confessed \"bad gag\" from Ian Taylor. \"Ambrosia's cut shot: Devon knows how they make it so creamy...\" I apologise. WICKET! Collingwood lbw b Gillespie 66 (335-8) Uncanny. England have lost so many wickets in the first over after a break in this series and so it happens again as Gillespie's first ball traps Collingwood on the crease and Koertzen applies the slow death. 105th over: England 335-8 (Sidebottom 13, Panesar 0) Monty wins the toss to bat at No10 and gets hold of a nice cover-drive which, tragically, is intercepted by a tumbling mid-off. Suddenly, the \"330-worst-case-scenario\" scenario isn't looking too far from the truth. \"Broad failed with the bat this time, but if he bowls well it will show that recent selections (him, Sidebottom and Ambrose) have done their jobs,\" says John Starbuck. \"The longer-serving characters have mostly got themselves and the team into difficulties, so maybe we should be looking for a faster turnover?\" Hmm, not sure about that, John... 106th over: England 339-8 (Sidebottom 14, Panesar 3) Chris Martin replaces Oram (29-11-46-3) and is immediately dropped into the leg-side for a single by Sidebottom. Panesar was a little slow to respond. Would he prefer to stay at the other end? Not if that clip off his legs for three is anything to go by! Shot, Monty (and we didn't notice your stumble at the end of the second run, honest). \"Right that's it Lawrence,\" says Nic Gibbens, \"Reading your commentary has its benefits, and it got me through the morning, but I'm off down to the Basin to cheer the tail on. Have a good evening.\" WICKET! Sidebottom c Bell b Gillespie 14 (342-9) At last the pull shot fails Sidebottom. That was a huge top edge and Matthew Bell had time to consider his future as he circled under the ball at short midwicket. \"Help required from OBOers\" says Paul Bradford. \"Am off to the cricket on Saturday and Sunday and staying with a female friend of my wife on the Friday and Saturday night. My wife has just rang and informed me that I am being taken along to a hen night on saturday in Wellington. Anyone got any prior experience of this sort of event and what usual protocol is? I would point out that I am very happily married as this may help to weed out some of the more unsavoury/lascivious advice.\" WICKET! Panesar c McCullum b Gillespie 6 (342) Gillespie will begin England's second innings on a hat-trick after Panesar flinches at a leg-stump delivery and gloves one high to McCullum's right. So, New Zealand will have half an hour to bat before lunch, which could be tricky. England would have preferred another 40 runs and that tail is still a concern, but the way the ball moved around this morning makes you think their bowlers have got a great chance now to expose the frailities - I'm thinking of Bell and Sinclair rather than How and Fleming - in New Zealand's top four. We shall see. A quick email \"Am I the only person here who thinks dropping Hoggy was the right thing to do?\" asks Simon West. \"Indeed, I'll go a skip further and say that anyone - I don't care how many wickets they've got in how many Tests - who has the temerity after game one of a three-game series to say he's just one match away from getting in the groove should have been escorted forthwith to the airport and shoved on the first plane home. How can they ever to hope to compete on equal terms with the best with that kind of attitude?\" 1st over: New Zealand 4-0 (How 3, Bell 0) I like How and Bell. They have seven letters between them (has there ever been a shorter opening pair?) and I can type their names loads of times without getting RSI. How and Bell. How and Bell. How and Bell. How and... oh, How picks up two runs off the second ball of the innings with a thick inside edge through square-leg as Sidebottom finds a bit of inswing. He follows that up with a smart single into the leg-side after Ian Bell had dived at short-leg to intercept a firm push. Sidebottom goes up for lbw against Bell (Matthew), but that was leg-sidish: the result is a leg-bye. \"Tell Paul not to go on the hen do,\" implores Don Kavanagh. \"He'll end up carting a bevy of dolled-up, cackling, trolleyed sheilas around Courtenay Place, surely the most soul-destroying experience a man can have. Tell him to accompany them as far as Molly Malone's and then \"lose\" them. While they go off and shriek loudly at every bloke they see, he can have a few civilised pints and a bit of quiet time, in a manner befitting the gentleman he no doubt is.\" WICKET! Bell b Anderson 0 (4-1) Anderson is back! OK, so Bell played all round a full-length swinger, but the way the ball hammered into the base of off-stump will give Anderson all the confidence he needed. \"If you were Jimmy Anderson, would you be more embarrassed about being picked for this match instead of Hoggy, or of being made to bat below Monty?\" asks Richard O'Hagan. How do you know he wasn't picked instead of Steve Harmison? After all, Harmy was probably the first of the two to be dropped, and the fact that England sent Anderson off to bowl for Auckland suggests he was ahead of Broad in the pecking-order. 2nd over: New Zealand 4-1 (How 3, Fleming 0) I didn't think Bell would get many runs, but a duck is a real bonus for England. They needed to expose Fleming to the new ball as early as possible, and so it has come to pass. A wicket maiden to start with! 3rd over: New Zealand 5-1 (How 4, Fleming 0) Another wicket before lunch would really help England believe that they can get something out of this game. How pushes Sidebottom just past short leg for a single, but there is swing here and Fleming has an ambitious waft at one that leaves him before being beaten outside off by a pearler. England will want the cloud cover to remain beyond the lunch break. \"Is this a future Sidebottom?\" wonders Paul Shields. 4th over: New Zealand 6-1 (How 5, Fleming 0) The sun is poking its unwelcome head through the clouds, which is not part of England's script. Anderson is finding a bit of swing, but his line is too wide of off-stump to trouble How, who keeps the strike with a quick single to extra over. \"Many years ago I was dared to attend an Hen's party on the proviso that I wore a dress,\" says Mark Gilroy. \"Rather drunkingly I complied and spent most of the time working out how to sit on the floor without exposing everything!! My admiration for the feminine skill set went up a notch that night.\" 5th over: New Zealand 7-1 (How 6, Fleming 0) How looks uncertain against Sidebottom's inswing, and is lucky to get another single past short leg as the ball moves in and takes the inside edge. England have made good use of the new ball here, but a second pre-lunch wicket would really help their appetites. Fleming knows all about Sidebottom from their time together at Nottinghamshire, and he's coping pretty well. But England could really do with that pesky ball of fire in the sky disappearing from view. \"Thankfully for the hen-night industry, I have no first hand experience of these matters, but I'd imagine many male strippers are happily married?\" says Tom Hopkins. WICKET! How c Strauss b Anderson 7 (9-2) Great stuff from Anderson, who finds enough swing to locate How's outside edge and Strauss is waiting at first slip. Well, well! \"Paul Bradford should slip a few quid to a big and scary-looking bloke to stage a fight with him,\" says Robin Hazlehurst. \"Big bloke can hassle the ladies in the hen party and Mr Bradford can chase him off, but in the process receive an \"injury\" that means he has to be taken away to hostiple and abandon the hen party. He gets to look heroic and gentlemanly while gaining their endless sympathy and, best of all, has the perfect excuse for running away.\" It's brilliant! 6th over: New Zealand 9-2 (Fleming 1, Sinclair 0) I don't fancy Sinclair for many here. Famous last words... 7th over: New Zealand 11-2 (Fleming 3, Sinclair 0) Fleming pushes Sidebottom for two into the covers as the last over before lunch gets under way and England will be delighted with their half-hour's work. If their lower order capitulated in mind-numbingly predictable fashion, Anderson has bowled them into a position of strength. How angry will Gavin Larsen be now? He was furious that Auckland gave Anderson the chance to get through nearly 40 overs last week, and he must be shaking his head sadly as he watches this. That's lunch. See you at 12.10am GMT to see if England's bowlers can maintain the pressure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
