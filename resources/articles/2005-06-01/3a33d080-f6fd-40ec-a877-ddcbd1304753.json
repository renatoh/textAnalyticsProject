Analysts had been keenly awaiting the results of US firm TKT's drug I2S, for the treatment of the rare genetic disease Hunter syndrome. The results had been seen as a make or break for the $1.6bn (\u00a3877m) cash deal, which was strongly criticised when it was unveiled by Shire in April. Analysts said TKT was too expensive and didn't fit with the firm's strategy. However, Shire has argued that TKT's drugs are low-risk and it fits with its focus on specialist disease areas. The American firm develops drugs that replace missing enzymes in rare genetic disorders. After taking I2S for a year, patients could walk 44 metres in six minutes rather than seven metres for those taking a placebo sugar pill, results that were hailed by analysts and shares gained 32p to close at 627.5p. Shire shareholders will receive a circular containing details of the deal in the next 10 days. The rise in Shire's price helped buoy an otherwise lacklustre market with the rising oil price - pushing up towards $60 a barrel - spooking investors. While BP added 4p to 590.5p and BG closed up 6.75p at 455.75p on the back of the rising oil price, British Airways hit turbulence - down 4.5p at 273p - on fears that the soaring oil price will feed through quickly into fuel prices. Down among the second liners easyJet was also hurt, down 5.25p at 242.75p. ICI lost 7.5p to 266.5p as investors fretted that the rising crude price will increase raw material costs. With Wall Street also lower and adding to the downward pressure, the FTSE 100 closed down 5.6 points at 5072.0. SAB Miller bucked the trend, up 13p at 854.5p, on talk that it is close to winning the battle for Colombia's Grupo Empresarial Bavaria and a positive note from the beverages team at Bear Stearns released just before the weekend. Cadbury Schweppes was also higher, up 10p at 541.p, on talk among traders that it has received a bid for its beverage operations from US venture capital firm KKR. But Royal Bank of Scotland lost 9p to 1662p on German reports that it is considering trumping the bid tabled by Italy's Unicredito for HVB Group and Enterprise Inns dropped 10p to 815p as the government unveiled its plans to ban smoking in public places. Away from the blue chips the FTSE 250 closed down 19.2 points at 7335.7 with the small cap index up 1.3 at 2917.1 points. Talk of a possible bid for car dealership operator Pendragon saw shares in the company lodged at the top of the FTSE 250 leaderboard up 13.25p at 293.25p, while Matalan was also boosted by bid speculation to 179p, up 3p. Cobham lost 24p to 1434p as the aerospace engineer announced the departure of the managing director of its Chelton antenna and navigation unit, Geoff Cooper. The news led Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein to lower its recommendation on the stock to hold from add. Also heading lower was CSR - formerly Cambridge Silicon Radio - as the analyst team at Baird dropped their stance to neutral from buy owing to the fact that the stock has hit its 390p target price. The shares eased 0.5p to 390p. The decision by Carphone Warehouse to launch its cheap-rate Talktalk service in Ireland offset news that non-executive deputy chairman David Ross, who co-founded the business with chief executive Charles Dunstone, has sold 6m shares in the company, making himself \u00a310.3m. He retains a stake in the business of just over 22%. His sale of shares follows the disposal of a similarly sized chunk of stock by Mr Dunstone earlier this month. Mr Dunstone still has more than 34% of the business. Shares in Hardy Underwriting added 3.5p to 222.5p as the specialist insurance group turned down a second offer from rival Omega Underwriting but said it will remain in talks. The ongoing talks helped support other insurers including Wellington Underwriting, up 2.75p at 106p, and Jardine Lloyd Thompson, up 7.25p at 385p. Shares in Finnish-based technology group Inion closed up 7.5p at 115p after the company, which makes biodegradable medical implants, announced US regulatory clearance for a number of new products while mobile phone software group Ubiquity rose 3.5p to 42.5p as it signed a deal with Nokia. But Wichford shares remained unchanged at 184.5p despite news that the property investment group has successfully raised \u00a3100m, through a placing at 180p, to buy more property. The market welcomed a number of new entrants yesterday with restaurant group FishWorks debuting on AIM at 33p and closing at 44.5p and E-retail rising 20% to close at 4.25p. Laser treatment company Chromogenex had a slightly less dramatic first day, closing at 11.75p after being placed at 11p. Finally the market will play host to internet technology firm Z Group today as the company joins AIM at 108p in a flotation expected to value the business at about \u00a321m. Z Group, which raised \u00a32.5m in an over-subscribed offer, is the first listing by the combined Panmure Gordon/Durlacher stockbroking outfit. Stanley strike Stanley Leisure gave up 2.5p to 558.5p as the company announced plans to hand back \u00a3325m of the cash it is making through the sale of its licensed betting shops to William Hill - but what remains of the company ran into problems with staff. The return of cash was roughly in line with what the market had been expecting and leaves the company focused on its casino business. But the GMB union yesterday announced the results of the first consultative strike ballot of British casino workers, saying that 77% of the company's workers voted for industrial action over pay. The 2,000 staff who work in Stanley Leisure's 41 casinos have rejected the company's 3.2% pay offer and union leaders are due to meet management for the next round of talks on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
