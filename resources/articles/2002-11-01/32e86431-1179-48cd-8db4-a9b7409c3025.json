Bali is on the blacklist, there are government travel advisories out on more than 100 countries around the world, and every day you open the paper to yet another nasty surprise in yet another totally unexpected location, all of them seemingly designed to convince us to stay home. Except even that's a non-starter. We might think of Europe as a \"safe\" destination, but it's worth remembering that there have been plenty of terrorist operations in Europe over the years. In fact, travel patterns are constantly changing. Bali may have seemed safe until a few weeks ago, but in the 1950s and 60s travel around much of south-east Asia was still a pretty intrepid affair. Indonesia was a closed shop for most of the Sukarno era, Malaysia had problems internally and externally, Thailand was a frontline for the Vietnam war and also had its share of internal problems, while Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia stayed closed until the 1990s. It's easy to forget that a substantial slice of the world's population was still inaccessible until about 20 years ago when China opened up. There are countless places around the world that could attract plenty of visitors but instead have managed to scare most of them away. Take Australia's nearest neighbour, Papua New Guinea. It's only a 90-minute flight from Cairns in northern Australia to Port Moresby, the city which recently came in last in the Economist Intelligence Unit's ranking of the world's best (and worst) cities to live in, 129 places behind the city I live in, Melbourne, which came in at number one. I made two fairly extensive trips to PNG back in the safer 1970s and thoroughly enjoyed the Highlands, the Sepik river and the outlying islands. Yet political instability, corruption and gangs of violence-prone \"rascals\" have effectively down-sized the tourist business. Ditto in Zimbabwe. I've made some great trips to what was once one of the safest countries in Africa, but President Mugabe has not only kicked out most of the country's best farmers, nearly bankrupted his nation and brought one of Africa's breadbaskets to the brink of starvation, he's also closed the tap on the country's once healthy tourist flow. Government corruption and the resulting instability has also made serious inroads into Kenya's tourist flow, trans-Saharan tourist traffic has ground to a halt in violence-wracked Algeria (although that might be easing up), Congo/Zaire is the centre of a big no-go area in central Africa, and periodically there are other flare-ups which flick the lights off for the tourist business around Africa. Fortunately, it's not all doom and gloom in Africa. Libya, with the finest Roman ruins around the Mediterranean and plenty of desert for sand and camel enthusiasts, is cautiously reopening, and while Ethiopia and Eritrea may not be everyone's idea of secure, stable and sensible destinations, they are one of the most interesting regions in Africa. It wasn't long ago that they were completely shut off. In East Africa, Tanzania and Uganda have climbed steadily back up. In fact, Africa as a whole has an undeservedly poor reputation because of its scattering of bad lands. My own travels around the northern, eastern and southern regions of the continent have all been remarkably easy, enjoyable and untroubled. It's also a terrific place for travel with kids - African wildlife may be great on TV but there's nothing like seeing the real thing. In the Pacific, normally thought of as a quiet and safe destination, Fiji is not quite what it was following the coup a few years ago (street crime has jumped), but the tourists have returned and are likely to return in even greater numbers since many Australian and New Zealand holidaymakers seem to operate on the principle that anything bad for Bali is good for Fiji, and vice versa. One other Pacific destination has managed to shoot its tourist business in the foot by the process of lots of its citizens shooting each other: the Solomon Islands. It had some of the best scuba diving in the Pacific, but right now it's only a heartbeat or two away from being totally dead. In other parts of the Pacific, it's not fear that keeps visitor numbers down but the sheer difficulty of getting there. The arrival of long range 747-400s may have been great for travellers, able to fly from Europe to Asia non-stop or all the way to Australia with just one stop, but it was disastrous for many Pacific nations which simply disappeared from the stopover business once the US West Coast to New Zealand and Australia became a non-stop route. Then there are places you could easily get to and which would be very interesting to visit but where the government has resolutely closed the doors to outsiders. Take Saudi Arabia, which could be endlessly interesting with the added advantage that many of its most unusual attractions are absolutely deserted. \"Saudis don't come here,\" a local explained at Madain Salah - a close copy of Jordan's lost city of Petra, minus the crowds. \"If it's not connected with the prophet, they're simply not interested.\" Nevertheless, the Saudi princes complain about being misunderstood by the outside world but still keep the entrance firmly shut. So, there are destinations we might like to go to if it wasn't for safety concerns, and others we'd like to go to if we could only find a way of getting there or if we could only squeeze through the entry restrictions. Then, there are destinations we simply feel uncomfortable about visiting, such as Burma because of its military dictatorship. Right now, many countries around the world are lamenting that their visitor numbers are down, but it wasn't so long ago that the reverse complaint persisted - there were simply too many tourists. In fact, it's always been surprisingly easy to get away from the crowds, just take a few steps off the beaten track or travel a few kilometres further from the nearest airport, and suddenly you're all by yourself. At one extreme, I made a trek out to western Tibet a couple of years back - a one-week walk through the mountains of western Nepal just to get there, then a one-week drive to get back to Lhasa at the end. Remote? We went to one monastic village we couldn't even find in the guidebooks. At the other extreme, I was in Venice this summer, one of Europe's most over-touristed city. Yet just a few minutes' walk away from the hordes in St Mark's Square, you could spend half an hour studying the art in some gem of a medieval church and never once see another visitor. Some people may simply decide to stay at home, but most travellers are going to go somewhere, no matter what. So one country's misfortune may just turn out to be another's lucky break. Bali may lose out as a cheap beach break, but Fiji will pick up the slack. Countries in Europe or other first-world destinations, such as New Zealand, may get extra visitors simply because they're perceived as safe. Travellers looking for a big continent-wide trip may pass over Cairo to Cape Town if they think too many parts of the route through Africa are likely to be off limits and think, instead, about sampling the Pan American Highway through Latin America. Or at least until they ponder how they're going to get through Colombia. Of course some intrepid (or fearless or foolhardy) travellers are going to make their way to the most outrageous places, no matter how bad an idea it might seem. The allied powers may be unwilling to extend their peacekeeping mission beyond Kabul in Afghanistan but that certainly doesn't seem to be stopping travellers launching their own tourist missions. Check the Afghanistan discussions in the Thorn Tree area of Lonely Planet's website (lonelyplanet.com) or have a look at mojo.mephistoweb.de, a site specialising in travel to that region. Personally? Well I'm not going to stop travelling. I feel sorry for governments having to put out warnings to travellers - they smack of that old line about the economist who accurately predicted nine of the last five stockmarket downturns. For all of the warnings about \"weapons of mass destruction\" and efforts to stir up public sympathy for a war on Iraq, the real mass destroyer is far more likely to be a Boeing airliner or a local-made Indonesian minivan. Recently, I've been thinking seriously about organising a visit to Iraq before somebody really messes it up, and next week I'm off to the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. Not much chance of trouble there, apart from angry penguins. \u00b7 Tony Wheeler is the co-founder of Lonely Planet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
