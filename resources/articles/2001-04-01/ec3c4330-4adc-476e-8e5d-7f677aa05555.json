And if mortgage rates are excluded from the calculations - the index preferred by the government - then the figure comes down even lower, to just 1.9%. But with polling day delayed for a month there was no set-piece press conference attended by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, no tour of the TV and radio studios, no attacks on Tory \"boom and bust\". On May 15 - the date when the data for prices in April is released - it be a different story. Cheaper mortgages and the chancellor's tax changes in the Budget will mean the inflation rate comes down a lot further, and with June 7 then only three weeks away there will be no holding back. The message will be that Labour, for so long haunted by the curse of high inflation, has taken the tough decisions needed to keep price rises low. The figures released yesterday by the office for national statistics support the case that something fundamental has changed, despite the fluctuations caused by one-off events such as the foot and mouth epidemic and bad weather. The slaughter of livestock pushed up pork prices by 10%, bacon by 9.6% and imported lamb by 4.9%. Prices of cauliflowers, cucumbers, lettuces, tomatoes and cabbages have all been affected by the unusually wet weather this winter. But over the longer term all the government's many different measures of inflation point to the same conclusion: that Britain is now a low inflation country. Measured by the all-items retail prices index - a basket of 650 goods covering 147 areas across the UK - inflation is 2.3%, compared with 27% at its post-war peak in 1975. On an international basis, the picture is even better. The EU uses a different method to calculate prices across Europe, and on this basis Britain's inflation rate is 0.8%, the lowest in the union. Falling inflation has been accompanied by much lower interest rates, something else for the government to revel in during the election campaign. A return to the inflation levels last seen in the 1950s and early 1960s has meant a return to the borrowing costs of 30 or 40 years ago. Interest rates, raised to 15% when inflation was nudging 11% in 1990, are down to 5.5%. Some City analysts believe they could be cut to 4.5% over the coming months. Government figures show that this fall in inflation is not a flash in the pan. Inflation averaged 2.6% a year between 1993 and 2000, with no evidence that a prolonged period of economic growth, accompanied by a fall in unemployment from almost 3m to just under 1m, is leading to increased price pressure. Overall, prices have risen by 72.2% since the retail prices index was last re-based at 100 in January 1987. But that increase disguises large disparities between different categories of spending. The prices of goods, where international competition has been ferocious, have risen much more slowly than inflation as a whole, but in large chunks of the service sector consumers are still getting a raw deal. The most spectacular example of falling prices is in audio-visual equipment, which now costs less than 40% of its price in 1987, largely as a result of the impact of cheaper and more powerful computer equipment. Household electrical appliances such as washing machines are almost 10% cheaper than at the end of the 1980s, while women's clothing costs 88% of prices 14 years ago. Even those goods which have increased in price - such as toys, CDs and tapes, furniture, shoes and men's clothing - have tended to rise more slowly than inflation as a whole. Food is up by 46.7% since 1987. So where is the inflation coming from? The answer is that prices in those parts of the economy sheltered from international competition or where the government has added to costs through taxation have risen sharply. Above-inflation increases in tobacco duties have meant that cigarettes have risen by more than any other item in the RPI basket, by 190% since 1987. Personal services such as dental examinations, eye tests and hairdressing follow a close second with a 177% rise, while the cost of entertainment is up by 167.6% and the cost of alcoholic drinks up 89.8%. The cost of taxing and insuring a car is up 164.8%, while rail fares are up 112%. In some areas of the service sector, government involvement has been good. Strengthened regulatory control over the privatised utilities has led to a sharp reduction in prices. Gas is up by less than 15% since 1987, electricity by 27.7%, and telephone charges have fallen by more than 10%. Only water - up by more than 150% - has bucked the trend. Given that rising prices helped to remove Labour from power in the elections of 1970 and 1979, it is hardly surprising that the party will seek to reap the political benefit of low inflation. But Roger Bootle, the economist who wrote the book The Death of Inflation in the mid-1990s, believes that longer term factors have been at work and that governments everywhere could soon have to grapple with the Japanese problem - falling prices. Globalisation, technological advance, competition and a tougher approach to inflation have all contributed to a change in the inflationary climate, which has been under way for 20 years. \"If this is what happens after 10 years of economic growth, it makes you wonder what would happen in a downturn,\" Mr Bootle said. The spectre of deflation, when a whole economy suffers the equivalent of negative equity, is one thing that would certainly not be welcome to the government.
