We recognise the need for change, but must also remember the absolute necessity of maintaining the crucial investment in our transport system, the foundation upon which our success is dependent. London is the powerhouse of the UK, consistently generating a huge tax export for the nation, and contributing more to the Treasury than any other region. Our economy is bigger than those of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the East Midlands combined. Although we are upgrading our infrastructure, much more needs to be done. Our tube network, the oldest in the world, carries around the same number of people as the entire national rail network. The crucial tube upgrade work must continue to address the mistake of past underinvestment. Our vital bus network carries even more people again and needs to be maintained. To protect our future competitiveness we must deliver Crossrail \u2013 the country's most significant economic development project. It will bring up to \u00a336bn to the national economy and must proceed with value for money at its heart, but as planned and without delay. Our message to those now facing the responsibility of government is clear: London's transport settlement must be safeguarded, and any diminishing of it will be to the detriment of the entire country.
