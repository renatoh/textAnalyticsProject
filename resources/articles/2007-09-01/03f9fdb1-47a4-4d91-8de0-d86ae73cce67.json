Amateur golf's premier team event has a recent history of producing epic contests but perhaps none as dramatic as this. After losing all the morning foursomes to drop four points behind their opponents, the home players needed to produce some exceptional golf, if only to retain their dignity. They did more than that, winning five of the eight singles and halving another. Indeed, for long periods of the afternoon they threatened to pull off a victory for the ages, only to be denied by Jonathan Moore, a 22-year-old from Washington State who was playing in his first Walker Cup. Moore will have some story to tell the folks back home, especially when he reaches the part about his approach shot to the par-five 18th that ended up three feet from the pin. It was a shot good enough to win any tournament. The US, which has ceded its dominance in the amateur game in recent years, has now won the past two Walker Cup matches. Yet if the visitors' celebrations were joyous, they were also tinged with relief after their apparently impregnable position going into the final eight singles matches was swept away by a remarkable comeback from the GB and Ireland team. To the delight of home fans, the comeback was led by Rory McIlroy, who finally lived up to his pre-tournament reputation in beating Billy Horschel in the first singles match of the afternoon. The 18-year-old Irishman, who will join the professional ranks this week, had earlier won only half a point from a possible three - a miserable return which included two losses to his singles opponent. As if that was not enough incentive there was also the American's on-course demeanour, which was only a cowboy hat short of Clint Eastwood. Suffice to say, there appeared to be little rapport between the pair as they walked off the 1st tee. There was even less when they walked off the green with McIlroy having holed a putt for eagle, a brilliant effort that he celebrated extravagantly. To the American's credit he won the next hole and played well for a long stretch, but not well enough to open up a significant lead. Eventually, the Irishman's talent showed through and three birdies in five holes over the back nine was good enough to secure a 4&amp;2 victory. \"I just want to get back on the course and see the team win some more points,\" he said after shaking hands. He did not have far to look, as first the Welshman Rhys Davies and then Lloyd Saltman won their matches to reduce the match deficit to only one point. Danny Willett, the English amateur champion, managed to take half a point from Colt Knost, the world's No1 ranked amateur - a creditable performance in any circumstances but especially so after he almost hit his tee shot on the 18th into a bush. He recovered to make a birdie. Team golf is always about momentum and at this stage GB and Ireland looked irresistible, even more so after Jonny Caldwell beat Kyle Stanley on the last, two-up. Alas for home hopes, there was no accounting for individual moments of brilliance. When Moore stood on the 18th fairway, with a four-iron in his hand, 252 yards to the flag and the hopes of his country on his shoulders, he could have been forgiven for falling apart. Instead he hit the shot of his life. \"It came off perfectly but I never dreamed it would finish so close. \" he said afterwards. \"Unbelievable.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
