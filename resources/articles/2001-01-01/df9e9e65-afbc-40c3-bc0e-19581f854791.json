The so-called education \"reforms\" initiated by the Tories and continued by David Blunkett were carried out in the context of a concerted attack on teachers' competence and values. Why would anyone want to belong to a profession that is undervalued, over-scrutinised and simultaneously blamed for so many social problems? I feel particularly aggrieved about the current situation. My children were at primary school as the Tory underinvestment in schools began to bite and when staff were adjusting to the new demands of SATs. Their school was forced to make cuts. The first to volunteer for redundancy were the older, more experienced, \"instinctive\" teachers, adored by the children but who knew they couldn't cope with new bureaucratic demands. There was no money for building or repairs and extra activities such as swimming were abandoned. Now at secondary school they are hit by chronic staff shortages. Nationally, the number of unfilled posts in secondary schools rose this month to over 1,200. Anecdotally the situation is known to be far worse. Many teachers are taking subjects for which they are not qualified and there is heavy reliance on \"holiday\" teachers. Australians, New Zealanders and French are the dominant groups. Great. The outcome of all those feverish reforms is the au-pair-isation of education. The government blames low pay and spiralling housing costs, especially in the south-east. But why is teaching disproportionately affected? Many middle-aged teachers who would normally be settled in housing have left the profession. But pay has never been the only issue. Teaching has always been underpaid because it was possible to exploit other motivations - love of a particular subject, enthusiasm to communicate it to the next generation, and the enjoyment of being with young people as they learn. Satisfaction, as in any job, comes when those values are central to the profession as a whole. Self-esteem comes when pupils and society at large endorse those values. But these factors have been systematically marginalised in teaching. Admittedly, social factors played a part in destroying respect from parents. But these pale into insignificance compared with the huge gulf between teachers' core motivational values and what they are being asked to do. Time and again we hear how teachers feel drowned by bureaucracy, by hours spent on form filling, writing out lesson plans, submitting documents for assessments and focusing on endless new initiatives, from SATs, to league tables and performance-related pay. No satisfaction comes from reaching these new targets as most teachers don't think they are worth the paper they are written on. More students may get starred As but teachers think the exams are easier and that the skills required to get such results are to do with fulfilling narrow targets rather than true education. So throwing money at this crisis is not likely to solve it. High salaries won't necessarily tempt teachers back. A new report by the National Association of Head Teachers shows that even with London salaries nudging \u00a3100,000 there's still a dire recruitment crisis. Last year 65% of all jobs had to be re-advertised. Now we hear rumours that the government finally intends to spend money rebuilding and refurbishing old schools. Like Railtrack's overdue track renewals, this will only make things worse in the short term. Good teaching relies on a degree of predictability. Blair and Blunkett's enthusiastic adoption of the Conservatives' educational policies, still rankles with me, in particular their renewing Chris Woodhead's contract. Now that he has departed on his own terms, history is exposing what his critics knew all along: his judgments were as personally motivated and ideological as those of the \"Marxist\" bogeymen he liked to attack. Only last week research showed that media studies degrees are the fifth best for employment. So much for Woodhead's claim that such \"vacuous\" courses do not lead to jobs. Woodhead's values suited Blair and Blunkett's own grim view of education: Gradgrind with a contemporary twist for the classic dual-income working parents who want to weigh and measure their children's achievements as proof that they've done it all right as well as had it all. The only remedy is for this lot to go back to basics - and I don't mean the three Rs at age-appropriate levels. They need to open up a general debate about what we want children to know; about how to inspire affection, loyalty, morality, care for the environment while encouraging independent thought and self-reliance. It's only when the ideas are worth teaching that we'll get teachers worth having. ros@roscoward.demon.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
