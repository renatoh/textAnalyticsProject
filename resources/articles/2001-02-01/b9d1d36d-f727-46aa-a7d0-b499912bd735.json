Sunderland's Stanislav Varga escaped an automatic red card for preventing a scoring opportunity in the incident that led to Liverpool's equaliser from a controversial penalty. Varga was not even booked for checking Gary McAllister's run on goal and in the mayhem that erupted over the penalty decision, given for a challenge shown to be outside the box, Barber appeared to forget to take the appropriate action of sending the defender off. The FA's referees committee will write to Barber for an explanation. The committee has the power to suspend officials in such circumstances, as once happened to Dermot Gallagher, though a severe reprimand is more likely. Barber's Premier League colleague Paul Durkin was rebuked after a similar incident last season when he failed to send off Chelsea's goalkeeper Ed de Goey. Graham Rix, the former Chelsea coach, will be interviewed for the vacant coaching position at Portsmouth this week - and hopes to beat his old Stamford Bridge colleague Ray Wilkins to the job at Fratton Park. Rix will meet Portsmouth's chairman Milan Mandaric and player-manager Steve Claridge in the hope of returning to football. The 43-year-old Rix has been out of a job since he and Wilkins were sacked by the Chelsea coach Claudio Ranieri after the Italian was appointed as Gianluca Vialli's replacement. Birmingham have signed Peter Atherton on a three-month loan from Bradford City. The 30-year-old defender is expected to make his debut in Saturday's home derby with West Bromwich. But he is not eligible for the League Cup final against Liverpool in Cardiff because he is cup-tied. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
