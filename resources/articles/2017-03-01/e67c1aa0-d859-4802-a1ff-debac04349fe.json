There will be no winner-takes-all showdown at the Aviva Stadium between the two sides expected to dominate the Lions squad this summer as a season that started with the loudest of statements as the All Blacks were beaten in Chicago threatens to end in mute disappointment. \u201cEngland is still a really important match for us,\u201d said the Ireland full-back Rob Kearney after the 22-9 defeat to Wales. \u201cThere is still a huge amount to play for.\u201d It was what he was expected to say, but it is only the consolation prize the Irish are playing for, the suppression of someone else\u2019s joy, rather than concrete achievement. After title triumphs in 2014 and 2015, Ireland\u2019s dreams involve more than beating England. The visitors seemed surprised on Friday night by the sustained ferocity of Wales under the closed roof of the Principality Stadium. The mood of the home supporters outside the ground before was largely one of foreboding after defeats to England and Scotland, arming themselves with the consolation that at least Ireland would in victory be able to snatch the championship trophy from Twickenham. Wales have in the Warren Gatland era had the capacity to show strength in adversity. Players were made an example of after the defeat in Scotland, not least the wing George North, a key figure on the 2013 Lions tour to Australia who has appeared to shrivel in stature this season. \u201cIt was the hurt,\u201d said North, when asked to explain the difference from Murrayfield where Wales had lost to Scotland for the first time in a decade. North, together with his fellow 2013 Lions Leigh Halfpenny, Jonathan Davies and Jamie Roberts, had his name for the Lions tour written in pencil rather than ink before Friday and that should remain so until Wales have played their final match against France in Paris next Saturday. It is how Wales play then, when the anger and indignation have subsided, that will be instructive. For all their fervour and sense of purpose in front of their own supporters, they would have been staring at defeat but for a moment of stupidity from Ireland\u2019s centre Robbie Henshaw who, 11 minutes from time with his side trailing 15-9, joined from the side a maul that was heading for the home line without him and turned a certain try for Ireland into a penalty for Wales. Henshaw, majestic in Chicago, was vulnerable in Cardiff as Wales looked to disrupt the Ireland half-backs, Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton, from the outset, hustling their opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes. It was an adrenalin-fuelled defensive effort, sustained throughout by the fear of losing and having to answer afterwards to their defence coach, Shaun Edwards, who was in the stand in body but on the pitch in spirit. Ireland waited for the collapse that never came and after second-half capitulations to England and Scotland, Wales scored two tries after the interval, the first when Sexton was in the sin-bin \u2013 he had been off the field for a head injury assessment when the home side scored their opening try \u2013 and the second after Dan Biggar charged down Sexton\u2019s kick for Roberts to seal victory and steal Ireland\u2019s bonus point. \u201cWe knew we were much better than we had been showing,\u201d North said. \u201cWe have players of amazing quality and we have to carry this with us to France.\u201d He scored his side\u2019s first two tries, the first after a lineout move based on pace, the ball moved wide with alacrity when the excellent Rhys Webb and Scott Williams combined to create space on the right wing, and the second after Webb lulled Ireland into thinking a maul was heading for their line and smuggled the ball out for his wing to run into unguarded territory. Biggar had never stood flatter for Wales and if it led to some interceptions, it also took Wales over the gainline. They made 10 clean breaks, kicked more strategically and won the mental battle by some distance. Basic skills remain a weakness and, but for Henshaw\u2019s brain fade, they may have again been reflecting on wasted opportunities and a conservative selection policy. It is four years since Wales last won the title and they drop a bit further away each year. That should be focusing their minds as they prepare for a game when they will not be responding to stick. They still have it all to prove."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
