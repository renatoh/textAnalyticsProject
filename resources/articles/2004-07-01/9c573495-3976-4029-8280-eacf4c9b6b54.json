Our most recent work has found a genetic cause for diabetes that occurs in the first six months of life,\" he says. \"The importance of that is that it has given a new treatment option for these children, because they can take tablets instead of relying on insulin injections for the rest of their lives.\" This group of patients is only a small proportion of diabetes sufferers in the world - and that, says Hattersley, is the point. \"It has become apparent during our research that there are lots of different causes for diabetes. It's leading us to a point at which we can individualise treatment through unravelling the different causes. Rather than give a broad-based treatment, we can refine it for different types.\" It's obviously a lengthy job - \"and the more we look, the more we find,\" says Hattersley. \"If you think of the human genome as a library of books, one misspelled word in one of those books can cause diabetes, and it can be a different word for different people. But once you know what books to look at, it becomes easier.\" Does all this mean a cure for diabetes is in sight? \"I wish I could say that,\" he says. \"For type one diabetes in young children with no beta cells to produce insulin, I think that there's increasing work to suggest we'll be able to get to a point where they are effectively cured. But the vast majority of diabetes sufferers have type two\" - where the beta cells are not destroyed, they are simply not working properly - \"and that's much more complex. \"It's down to genetic predisposition, but also lifestyle factors, like the obesity problem we have. The numbers involved make it more difficult, but if we can at least begin to understand the process, that's a start.\" Hattersley's own interest in diabetes began at college. \"I had a friend with diabetes; it's odd how these things can affect you. I have enjoyed looking after patients with diabetes as a doctor as well as researching it.\" He believes, too, that the UK is an excellent place in which to carry out research. \"We have a very strong community of diabetes doctors here. Other doctors are happy to refer patients, which means we can be completely led by patients, who are enormously keen to help. \"In America, because of their ethos and health system, the majority of their work is done on animals and cells.\" Hattersley and his team are also committed to looking beyond the lab to people with diabetes. \"We talk about taking it from the bench to the bedside. We're not only interested in the genetic research but also in treatment. We look at a range of things, like the psychology of diabetes. What's it like to be on insulin for 20 years and then come off it? We have enormous strengths at the Peninsula Medical School that enables us to look at all these things.\" And Hattersley is clearly thrilled when his research pays off with increased options for patients, as with his most recently published research. \"As geneticists we're used to being able to find a cause, but it's unusual to be able to translate that into treatment. It's a very exciting combination when your research can affect treatment choices.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
