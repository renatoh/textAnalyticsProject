He announced an investigation into the affair after disclosing that no other elected party official knew about the deals until they were revealed a week ago in the wake of the \"loans for honours\" controversy. The Guardian was told earlier this week that the loans were agreed between millionaire donors, Lord Levy, the party's fundraiser, and Matt Carter, then general secretary of the party. Three of the donors were subsequently put on the prime minister's honours list. Mr Dromey, a prominent trade unionist, announced that he would work with the new general secretary, Peter Watt, and report to Labour's national executive committee next Tuesday. He also called for the Electoral Commission to investigate. The commission will be asked to advise on the wider public interest issues surrounding parties taking loans from non-commercial sources, including what the decision-making process should be to ensure a necessary democratic overview and transparency. \"I strongly believe in high standards in public life,\" said Mr Dromey. \"It was the Labour party that campaigned in opposition for action to ensure there was the necessary transparency as part of the clean-up of politics. I have, therefore, commenced an inquiry into the securing of loans in secret by the Labour party in 2005. I will report back to the national executive committee next Tuesday on what happened and what we need to do to ensure that never again are the elected officers of the Labour party kept in the dark. \"The Labour party needs to put its house in order to restore public and party members' confidence. There are wider public interest issues, however, for all political parties that require to be investigated properly by the independent electoral commission.\" The announcement came hours after one of the donors, property millionaire Sir David Garrard, asked Tony Blair to withdraw his nomination for a peerage. This meant all three donors have effectively said they do not want their names to go forward. Chai Patel, owner of the Priory Clinic, has already said he regretted lending money to Labour because of the row, and stockbroker Barry Townsley has also asked for his name to be withdrawn. The three are said to have loaned \u00a33.5m to Labour in the run-up to the last election. A spokeswoman for Sir David said yesterday: \"Sir David learned, for the first time, of his nomination in around October 2005, when he was informed that this came as a result of his lifelong commitment to and activities in the field of child welfare and education, and his vigorous support of the government's educational agenda, particularly the academy programme. Sir David confirms that he did make a loan on commercial terms prior to the last general election.\" The spokeswoman said Sir David was \"disappointed\" that in the months since the nominations list was leaked, \"the appointments commission has not once asked for clarification\" of any issues that could have been under investigation. Tony Wright, chairman of the Commons public administration committee, has already decided to hold an inquiry into the honours system, including the award of peerages to Labour donors. Yesterday the Liberal Democrats demanded a freeze on future nominations for peerages. Simon Hughes, the constitutional affairs spokesman, said: \"There should be no more nominations to the Lords until the situation is clarified.\" Big lenders Sir David Garrard, 65, property developer. Said to have made Labour a \u00a31m loan and donations of \u00a3220,000. Barry Townsley, 59, stockbroker, CEO of Dawnay Day Townsley. Said to have made Labour a loan of \u00a31m. Chai Patel, 69, chief executive of the Priory Group. He made Labour a \u00a31.5m loan and now regrets the controversy it caused."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
