The pair are both established above a 2640 rating, equal to a place in the world top 100 grandmasters, and have set their sights on the 2700 elite yardstick, the level of the world top 40-50, which gives chances of a place in invitation tournaments. Beyond 2700 is the UK No1, Michael Adams, securely established in the top 20 and who at 43 still has a steady rating around 2740, close to his all-time best mark. Adams rarely plays a bad tournament and it could be at least three to five years before Jones or Howell can hope to challenge him. Statistics show that the majority of GMs reach 2700 in their teens or early 20s, and it becomes progressively harder after that age to make the necessary improvement. Still, Howell has a real chance. Since leaving university and becoming a full-time professional he has advanced about 50 points and is approaching 2680. Last month he scored his best result yet when he finished runner-up to the US No1, Hikaru Nakamura, at Tradewise Gibraltar and collected a \u00a315,000 prize, the largest of his career and ensuring a financial base for an attempt at 2700. This month\u2019s European championship in Jerusalem was a setback, as Howell tied for the lead on 5.5/7 four rounds from the end but tailed off with 1/4, so missing out on a qualifying place in the lucrative 2015 World Cup knockout. There was extra pressure because he was the only Englishman in a powerful field dominated by east Europeans and ex-Soviets. Although he finished 54th overall, he was as high as fifth among the west Europeans. Jones reached his rating peak at 2671 early this year, then had a setback at Tradewise Gibraltar, and this week was joint second at Reykjavik with a round to go before a bad final game spoilt that, too. The Yorkshire GM\u2019s strength in the past has been his imaginative opening novelties and it could be that he needs a break to recharge his creative ideas. This week\u2019s game from Reykjavik is a rerun of one of the best-known shocks in chess history, Garry Kasparov\u2019s 1997 loss to the super-computer IBM Deep Blue. The Peruvian\u2019s 8...fxe6 is much better than the fatalistic 8...Qe7? chosen by Kasparov, and White soon lost the thread. 12 Rxe6 and 14 Be3 are possible improvements, since as played White was soon a piece down for nothing.

The reigning champion, Hou Yifan, is absent as a protest against the two-game knockout format, but will play a title match against the winner. Games begin on Saturday at midday, when Edinburgh\u2019s Keti Arakhamia-Grant, 46, whose CV includes the male GM title and the Scottish title against men, will be in action. Arakhamia-Grant knocked out a higher rated Hungarian in round one and now faces the No11 seed and fellow veteran Sweden\u2019s Pia Cramling, 51. Their first game on Friday was drawn, and if they halve again on Saturday it will go to speed tie\u2011breaks on Sunday. 3382 One and three quarter moves, wrote Purdy. The white king is off the board so must be in White\u2019s hand en route to 1 0-0-0 Ke3 2 Re1 mate. Castling is half a king move, half a rook move, hence White is a quarter of the way through the process. But arguably Purdy is wrong, and the answer should be 1.51 moves, with the king on the point of touchdown at c1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
