Contracts secured since the fall of Saddam Hussein range from the reconstruction of water utilities to the printing of new Iraqi currency and the supply of armed protection to companies and government clients. Corporate Watch estimated that the real gains made by British companies could be much higher than its estimate because the value of several large contracts is not known. The construction company Amec tops the list of British companies, with contracts in Iraq worth \u00a3500m. It has almost completed work on three joint contracts with Fluor to restore water and power infrastructures, and is providing environmental consulting for new facilities for the US airforce. The next most successful company is Aegis, the private security firm run by the retired British army officer Lieutenant Colonel Tim Spicer. The company has secured at least \u00a3246.5m in contracts. Missing from the list of 66 companies are major oil firms such as BP, which Corporate Watch claimed were holding back investment until a safe pro-corporate environment had been created. The contracts so far have been largely financed by an \u00a3890m investment from the US Agency for International Development and the Pentagon and a \u00a3166m investment from Iraq itself. British taxpayers' money accounts for \u00a379m of contracts awarded. Water and power contracts have delivered \u00a3501m of work to British companies, private security \u00a3383m; petroleum \u00a376m; financial \u00a362m and construction \u00a325m. Adam Smith International - a commercial off-shoot of the free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute, which was used by Margaret Thatcher - is providing technical support to the Iraqi prime minister's office, other government institutions and three ministries which are key for reconstruction: finance, municipalities and public works, and planning and development cooperation. Another favourite of the Thatcher governments, now involved in Iraq, is Tim Bell, who ran the Tories' election campaigns in 1979, 1983 and 1987. His PR firm, Bell-Pottinger, has been involved in \"a strategic campaign to promote bigger concepts such as the return of sovereignty, reconstruction, support for the army and police, minority rights and public probity\". Corporate Watch claimed that the awarding of large contracts to foreign businesses was an attempt to stimulate the fragile Iraqi economy, and that a free-market approach was being encouraged as ground work for a shift towards a corporate-dominated economy. It said this would have repercussions lasting decades after the end of the military occupation. The spokesman for Amec, Charles Reynolds, denied this was a motivation for his company's involvement. \"This doesn't sit well with the reason we went into Iraq. When the coalition provisional authority was awarding the majority of contracts to American firms we were proud to be the one major UK company helping to rebuild the country. We don't have any vested interest and much of our work is now complete and we don't anticipate any major orders this year and we anticipate our people being withdrawn over the course of 2006.\" Ric Nye, the director of international construction at the British Construction Consultants Bureau, said its members working in Iraq were increasingly signing contracts directly with Iraqi ministries and with Iraqi companies based in Jordan. \"The major concern is still security,\" he added. \"Up to 60% of project costs go on security and insurance.\" \"The entry of UK companies into Iraq has been based on links established with the US-led invasion and occupation forces,\" Loukas Christodoulou, of Corporate Watch, wrote. \"The coalition provisional authority itself included UK government figures, such as the UK special representative for Iraq, who sat on the 'programme review board', which made decisions on project spending.\" British contracts are lagging far behind the US. As a member of the \"coalition of the willing\" that invaded Iraq, the UK was expected to reap significant rewards in terms of reconstruction and oil contracts. Mr Christodoulou said: \"The hundreds of millions of dollars that UK companies have received is relatively small change when compared to the lion's share taken by the US.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
