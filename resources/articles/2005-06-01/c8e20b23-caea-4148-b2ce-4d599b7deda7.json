But low-cost rivals Ryanair and easyJet piled on the competitive pressure by continuing to refuse to introduce surcharges. BA said the surcharge on short-haul flights - those to destinations in Europe and to Tel Aviv - would rise from from \u00a36 to \u00a38 on Monday. On long-haul flights the surcharge is being raised from \u00a316 to \u00a324, making a \u00a348 surcharge for the return trip. Tickets which have already been purchased are not affected. Virgin said it was putting up its surcharge by the same amount as the increase on BA's long-haul flights. \"The continuing rise in global oil prices to almost $60 a barrel means a further surcharge increase is regrettably unavoidable,\" BA's commercial director Martin George said. BA now expects its fuel bill this year to be about \u00a31.6bn - some \u00a3450m higher than last year. \"This additional fuel surcharge will help to offset the recent sharp increases in the price of fuel,\" Mr George said. EasyJet expects its fuel bill to be \u00a360m up in the financial year to the end of September, but its spokesman Toby Nicol insisted: \"There will be no fuel surcharges at easyJet. \"We don't think they work. Passengers don't really care what the fare is made up of, they are only prepared to pay a certain amount to travel. The market sets the price, not the airlines.\" Ryanair attacked the BA decision and said it guaranteed it would never introduce them \"not now, not ever\". Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's head of communications, said: \"Why don't BA reduce other costs instead of gouging their passengers? BA's fuel surcharges are now higher than most of Ryanair's airfares.\" A BA spokesman said the airline had decided to show the impact of higher oil prices \"in a transparent manner so it is very clear what we are seeking for the fuel surcharge\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
