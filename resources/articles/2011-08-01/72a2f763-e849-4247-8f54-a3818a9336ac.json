Look, he's even said that's what he's doing. \"Apologies for raining on Sean Duffy's parade but my own team Chelsea are on something of an opening-day run themselves at the moment since they last lost on the opening day of the 1998-99 season,\" notes Nick. \"In the time since then we have chalked up 11 wins and one draw. 10-11: Chelsea 6-0 West Brom 09-10: Chelsea 2-1 Hull 08-09: Chelsea 4-0 Portsmouth 07-08: Chelsea 3-2 Birmingham 06-07: Chelsea 3-0 Manchester City 05-06: Wigan 0-1 Chelsea 04-05: Chelsea 1-0 Manchester United 03-04: Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea 02-03: Charlton 2-3 Chelsea 01-02: Chelsea 1-1 Newcastle 00-01: Chelsea 4-2 West Ham 99-00: Chelsea 4-0 Sunderland \"That is an aggregate opening day scoreline of 34-8. Stoke must be worried. Oh and incidentally, the last team we lost to on the opening day was Coventry.\" Some consolation for Sean, then. Mark Andrews is on hand as well. \"I give you Wimbledon,\" he says. \"Since losing 3-0 to Manchester United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season, Wimbledon have not been beaten on any opening day. They have won 11 of those 14 fixtures, drawing the other three.\" Alas, Bristol Rovers curtailed this run in their first match back in the League last Saturday. However Chelsea, Coventry and Wimbledon are all blown out of the water by Juventus, who incredibly did not lose on the opening day from 1982 to 2010, a whopping 28 years. That includes the year they spent in Serie B in 2006-07. On 12 September 1982, they were beaten 1-0 away to Sampdoria, Mauro Ferroni scoring the only goal of the game in the 67th minute. The following year, Juventus beat Ascoli 7-0, starting as they meant to go on until Bari's 1-0 home win last season. Do you know any team that can beat that? Let us know at the usual address. DE-FAULT: THE TWO SWEETEST WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE \"With Paraguay reaching the Copa Am\u00e9rica final despite not winning a single game, have any teams done any 'better' and won a championship without winning any games?\" asks Pablo Miguez. Pablo, let's not forget that Paraguay didn't even score a goal in the knock-out stages, winning their quarter-final and semi-final on penalties. Truly they are the Buzz Killington of football. And Jack Charlton's Republic of Ireland side in the 1990 World Cup, who got to the last eight by drawing all of their games. However their luck ran out against the hosts, Italy, who beat them 1-0. But they've got nothing on Russian side Alania Vladikavkaz, who crawled all the way to the final of the Russian Cup without even scoring a goal. For more details, here's Graham Hales: \" Alania Vladikavkaz qualified for Europe last season through the Russian Cup despite not winning a single game or even scoring a goal,\" writes Graham. \"They qualified for the final through three 0-0 draws (all won on penalties) plus a quarter-final walkover against Saturn, who went out of business just before the tie was due to take place. They met CSKA Moscow in the final, where they did finally score a goal, but lost 2-1. With CSKA already in a Champions League place, this stunningly tedious cup run means they started their barely-deserved Europa League campaign by beating Aktobe of Kazakhstan ... but only on penalties after two 1-1 draws.\" So they got to the final without scoring, only to lose faith in Plan A once they were there, score and lose. Kids, there's a lesson to be learnt here: never score. MATCHES IN WORKING HOURS \"On a recent trip to the US I noticed quite a few Major League baseball games are played during normal working hours,\" wrote Derek Brosnan. \"For example, the Chicago Cubs have games scheduled for Tuesday and Friday at 2.20pm. I was wondering when was the last time a football game on English soil has been played during normal working hours?\" \"I would suggest there are many reserve-team fixtures played in the afternoons particularly during school holidays,\" offers Michael Haughey. \"As for first-team games, Preston North End had two in the 1985-86 season when the floodlights had to be taken down and no money was available to replace them. Preston lost 1-0 on a Tuesday afternoon to Scunthorpe on 5 November, then three weeks later beat Wrexham 2-0 in a Freight Rover Trophy match also with at 2pm on a Tuesday. If normal working hours are 9am-5pm Monday to Friday, except bank holidays, we can discount Blackpool having to play midweek games at 5.30pm in the early 90s for the same reason. \"And there is another: Brighton v York, played on the morning of Thursday 9 May 1996. This occurred after the original match was abandoned when fans protesting the club's move from the Goldstone Ground invaded the pitch and broke both crossbars. There were 2,106 fans present at the rearranged fixture. As well a midweek morning kick-off time, it was an all-ticket match, with tickets only sold the day before the game.\" Jack King also has a long memory. \"I can remember an FA Cup fifth round replay between Arsenal and Derby County in the 1971-72 season played on a weekday afternoon due to the power strike going on at the time, which meant no floodlights could be used,\" he notes. \"I was there and it finished 0-0.\" It doesn't sound like it was worth it. FICTIONAL CLUB NAMES (2) Last week we covered clubs named after fictional characters. However one reader has emailed in to provide a correction about one of the answers. \"The Mexican club Atlante are not, as suggested last week, named after Atlanta (as the Italian club Atalanta is),\" points out Richard Ailes. \"Though it is an alternative name in Spanish for the character more commonly known as Atlas, according to the club's website, they were not named directly after him either, but after the Atlantic Ocean, and possibly the legend of Atlantis. The maritime motif seems a little out of place given that the club was formed over 12,000 feet above sea level in Mexico City, but they seem to have had a thing about water, and things that sink in water; they were previously named 'U-53' after the German submarine, and previous to that, 'Lusitania'. \"In any case, the name of the Titan was already taken by then. Atlas of Guadalajara were formed in 1915 by a group of young Mexicans who had learned the finer points of the game while schooling at Catholic Colleges of England such as Ampleforth in Yorkshire and St Aloysius in Highgate, and it was an old Aloysian, Juan Jos\u00e9 Cortina, who came up with the name, believing that with their youthful enthusiasm and a superior team game to their local rivals, the group would 'prop up the world of Mexican football'. Perhaps football practice at St Aloysius clashed with Classics; in Greek mythology, Atlas was the bearer of the heavens, not the earth.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE Michael McCarthy posed this sartorial head-scratcher in 2008: \"Tranmere Rovers have had the same shirt sponsor since 1989. Are there any teams who have had theirs longer?\" In response, Timothy Casson, Chris Clough and Steve Wilson all pointed to PSV Eindhoven, a club that began life as a works team for Philips. The brand name has adorned their shirts since 1982, when Dutch football first allowed top-flight shirt sponsorship, and it is unlikely to be taken off as long as the electrical-peddler remains in charge. Paul Haynes highlighted a similar set-up at Bayer Leverkusen whose badge \u2013 \"the Bayer cross\" \u2013 is the emblem of pharmaceutical company Friedrich Bayer and has adorned the club's shirt since 1904 but, crucially, not at the expense of other sponsors names. And Richard Henriksson wrotes in from Sweden with a potential winner. While IFK Gothenburg have had ICA - a Swedish grocery store \u2013 on their shirts since 1982 (the same as PSV), they began sporting ICA on their shorts in 1976. \u2022 For thousands more questions and answers, take a trip through the Knowledge archive, or treat yourself to copies of The Knowledge: Your Football Questions Answered and its thrilling sequel More Knowledge: More of Your Football Questions Answered.
