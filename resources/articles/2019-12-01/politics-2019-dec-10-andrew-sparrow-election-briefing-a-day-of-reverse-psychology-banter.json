In the 11-minute recording Ashworth said: Outside of the city seats, if you are in small-town Midlands and north, it\u2019s abysmal out there. They don\u2019t like [Boris] Johnson, but they can\u2019t stand Corbyn and they think Labour\u2019s blocked Brexit \u2026 The electoral map is going topsy-turvy because of Brexit, and because of Corbyn. The question is for Labour, if it gets itself a half-decent leader next time round, whether it can reverse and regain its traditional heartland seats \u2026 Johnson and CCHQ would have to massively fuck it up in the last week [to lose the election]. The recording was obtained by the anti-Labour website Guido Fawkes and posted online this morning. Ashworth immediately accepted that the tape, which seems to have been recorded early last week, was genuine. He was talking to a Tory activist he had known for years and whom he considered a friend, he said. Ashworth initially said his comments, which included a vague hint that Corbyn might be considered a security risk by officials in No 10, were \u201cbanter\u201d, and later he expanded on this, saying he was deliberately trying to lull the Tories into a false sense of security. He told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live (no relation to the original Guardian Politics Live): [My friend] was ringing me. I was talking to him. He was saying his sources at CCHQ say Labour\u2019s doing well. I\u2019m doing the old, what Alex Ferguson would do, football manager kind of thing, trying to psych him out, saying, \u2018No, you\u2019re going to win, don\u2019t worry about it\u2019, because I know he\u2019s an activist in Canterbury, I\u2019m trying to make him complacent. If Ashworth really was engaged in a cunning attempt to mislead CCHQ, he is a better actor than people have given him credit for and clearly has potential as a double agent. (You can listen to the recording here and decide for yourself what to think.) Notwithstanding, he apologised to Labour members. And Corbyn indicated that he accepted Ashworth\u2019s explanation, telling the BBC: Jon has my full support and I\u2019m cool with Jon, we get along great. He said to me it was all about reverse psychology banter as in football supporters, and the other person was saying the opposite about their party and it all got a bit out of hand. In politics, as in most walks of life, people do say disobliging things about their bosses in private from time to time and Ashworth\u2019s comments were relatively mild compared to some of the comments made about Corbyn by his MPs behind his back. In public at least, Ashworth\u2019s colleagues have been supportive. Most of them probably feel understandable sympathy for the way Ashworth appears to have been let down by a longstanding friend he thought he could trust. Stop Brexit party might stop Brexit, warns Johnson Boris Johnson has said it is \u201cvery hard\u201d to see Brexit happening if the Tories fail to get a majority. Speaking at a Q&amp;A at a JCB factory, he said: I don\u2019t see any alternative but a working majority to deliver [Brexit] \u2026 Nicola Sturgeon has just hired a bus with \u2018Stop Brexit\u2019 on it, so she\u2019s obviously not in favour of it. And she\u2019s the only way that Jeremy Corbyn can remain in office. So it is very hard to see how we do it without a working-majority Conservative government. That\u2019s what we need to go for. Meanwhile Johnson has given his strongest hint yet that he is not planning to scrap HS2. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claimed Johnson has changed his Brexit strategy within the last week, opting for a softer version. Farage said this explained why he would not be voting Tory in his own constituency, where the Brexit party aren\u2019t fielding a candidate. In truth, Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan has not changed, but Farage is right to say that on the campaign trail Johnson has increasingly been suggesting that the fact he has an \u201coven-ready\u201d withdrawal agreement ready to go (which is true) also means that his eventual UK-EU trade deal is also nearly complete (which is not true at all). Jo Swinson has accused Boris Johnson of showing \u201can empathy bypass\u201d, as the Liberal Democrats made a final push to persuade traditional Labour supporters to vote tactically and deny the Conservatives a majority. A medical secretary has claimed her Facebook account was hacked after it was used to post false information claiming that a photograph of an ill boy on the floor at Leeds general infirmary was staged for political purposes. The father of Jack Merritt, who was murdered in the London Bridge terrorist attack last month, has directly criticised the prime minister for treating his son\u2019s death as a political \u201copportunity\u201d.
