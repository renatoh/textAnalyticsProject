Essex police said the families of those found dead in the refrigerated lorry trailer in Grays last month had been informed. Caroline Beasley-Murray, the coroner, said: \u201cMay I take this opportunity to offer my deepest condolences to the victims\u2019 families.\u201d The senior officer in charge of the inquiry, Tim Smith, an assistant chief constable, said: \u201cThis is an important step in the investigation and enables us to work with our Vietnamese police colleagues to support the families of those victims. \u201cIt is only right that we provide an opportunity for family members to take in the news confirming the death of their loved ones before releasing any further information.\u201d Police in Vietnam have arrested eight people in relation to the case. Although local authorities did not reveal their identities, they are suspected of being part of a ring responsible for smuggling Vietnamese people to Britain. The Vietnamese government has strongly condemned human trafficking and described the deaths as a \u201cserious humanitarian tragedy\u201d. Nguyen Huu Cau, the Nghe An province police chief, said: \u201cBased on what we learn from the suspects, we will actively launch investigations to fight and eradicate these rings which bring people illegally to Britain. \u201cThe best thing to do now is to deal with the consequences of the incident and help family members receive the bodies.\u201d So far, two people have been charged in the UK. Essex police have started extradition proceedings to bring Eamonn Harrison, 22, from Ireland to the UK. Harrison, of Newry, Northern Ireland, appeared at Dublin high court last Friday charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, along with human trafficking and immigration offences, and was remanded in custody. The driver of the lorry, Mo Robinson, 25, appeared at Chelmsford magistrates court on 28 October charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. Detectives have urged Ronan Hughes, 40, and his brother Christopher, 34, said to have links with the road haulage and shipping industries, to hand themselves in. The pair, from Armagh in Northern Ireland, are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
