It is not in itself a particularly bad book, but it does quite well something that does not need doing at all. The book blends two recent publishing trends, and one that is as old as the invention of writing. The newest trend is the wacky science subject. If there is a market for books about cryptography, chronometry or even cod - and books on all these subjects have sold well in the last decade - then there is no reason why any subject should seem intrinsically boring. In fact, the secret of success would seem to be to choose something that no one has ever thought about for long enough to write a book proposal without dropping into a sudden narcolepsy. Once you have discovered a subject so obscure that no other publisher has come across it before, all that remains is to prove that it holds the key to universal understanding. Cod: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World is a pretty good example; but Universal Foam outdoes it, since it permeates the universe from the smallest to the largest scale. After all, there aren't any galaxies stretched on the skin of unimaginably vast cod. Nor do physicists speak of the world arising from fluctuation in the quantum codfish. So the Boys' Bumper Book of Froth might contain, as a bestseller should, everything you need to know about the universe. Then again, it might contain everything else. That's pretty frothy, too. In fact, Universal Foam runs into another current publishing style: the book of lists. First, list every-thing that might be frothy in the universe, from galaxies through cuckoo-spit to styrofoam. Among the subjects covered here are volcanoes, shaving cream, champagne, fire-fighting equipment and meringues. Then you list everything that you know about everything in the first list: 101 important facts about galaxies; 20 things you never knew about cappuccino; the seven principles of highly effective styrofoam, and so on. There is a trick missed here, since Universal Foam contains only 10 or 11 facts about styrofoam. Perhaps the most important one is that the stuff they put coffee into is actually a different sort of plastic. It contains even less information about how they put the bubbles into Coca-Cola. Finally, all this is wrapped up in the academic style, as old as exams, where you simply cram in all the knowledge that you can possibly get hold of and regurgitate it with the echoing solemnity of a TV anchorman on The Simpsons : \"That suggests a rhetorical question: 'Can everyday foams, like milk foam, ever be fully understood and controlled?' The answer seems to be, understood, yes; fully controlled, perhaps not.\" At this point, there was foam flecking the gibbering reviewer's lips. This style is - oh God, I can't help it - another example of packaging foam, or \"peanuts\" as Americans call them. This, we learn, comes in several colours, depending on whether it has been made from recycled foams, or specially treated to reduce static electricity. There are 45m pounds of this interesting substance created every year in the United States. You will even learn from this book the names of the three largest companies making the stuff and its characteristic shapes. Can this really be what one reviewer meant when he said, as the blurb proudly quotes, that Universal Foam would supply endless material for dinner-party conversations? Are these the materials of bubbling wit? You can't really blame the author, Sidney Perkowitz. He has worked hard; he writes clearly. It is not his fault that he has nothing particular to say after he has got through the bits that actually interest him, which are the fairly technical discussions of how to measure foams and describe them mathematically. This book has been not so much written as extruded, along with uncountable others. The phenomenon is hardly a new one, but there are times when it seems to choke off every other sort of book. \"Come hither, all you empty things, you bubbles raised by marketing\", as Swift so nearly wrote in an early literary reference to foam."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
