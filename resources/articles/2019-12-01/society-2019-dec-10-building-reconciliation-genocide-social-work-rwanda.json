During a visit coordinated by the National Organisation of Social Workers (NOSW), I saw the powerful contribution of social work to restoring a nation torn apart by genocide, working towards a reconciliatory and vibrant future. The social work profession in Rwanda was formed following the 1994 genocide, which had its roots in the colonialist divide-and-rule administration and systematic oppression of the Tutsi population. After the slaughter of more than 800,000 people, Rwanda\u2019s social fabric was in tatters. Economic institutions collapsed, there was widespread displacement and many women were pregnant as the result of rape. However, Consolee Uwihangana of the NOSW stresses: \u201cThe story of Rwanda is one of overcoming the history sown by the colonists. Ours is a story of reconciliation, repair and self-reliance, and as a nation we have made immense strides.\u201d Social work has been a key factor in making this progress, through homegrown solutions or indigenous models of development that address the many layers of social wounds. Uwihangana explains the role of social workers: \u201cWe are counsellors, community facilitators, advocates and policy influencers. We work both with individuals and whole communities as the nation needs to work together to overcome the challenges.\u201d Among other approaches, social workers have been deeply involved with programmes such as umuganda (community work), ubudehe (local collective action) and girinka (one cow per poor family). With girinka, social workers are using an indigenous tradition as a vehicle for community change. A cow is issued to every poor family and, according to Charles Kalinganire of NOSW: \u201cGiving the firstborn calf to your neighbour has been an enormous part of the reconciliation process, as neighbours and villagers to this day swap cows, reinforcing their connections and bonds.\u201d Another inspiring example of social change from Rwanda\u2019s capital city, Kigali, is Hope and Homes for Children, a community hub that prevents children from being abandoned. Emery Nduwimana, a social worker with the charity, explains that some of the factors that contribute to child abandonment include parental trauma resulting from rape, family isolation, drug abuse, vulnerability and stigma towards children with disabilities. As we drive into the mid-city community along the red earth road, Nduwimana points out the range of activity at the centre. In one classroom the walls are vibrating from loud drumming as young men practise traditional dance. \u201cOur traditional culture is a safe and vibrant setting for them,\u201d Nduwimana says before leading me to a classroom where adults are learning English as skills for employment. Outside, a group of women in patterned dresses and brightly coloured head scarves are holding a weekly meeting to administer their community finances. The programme offers loans to community members, supporting their entrepreneurial plans and providing relief when times are hard. Women\u2019s participation in decision-making has also been a principal focus for social workers, as the president of the National Women\u2019s Council, Jeannette Bayisenge, says: \u201cDevelopment needs to include gender equality, as under the old colonial systems, men had the right to make all decisions.\u201d She tells me that Rwanda has one of the world\u2019s highest proportions of women in power as 61% of members of parliament and 50% of the cabinet are female. There is still more work to be done to promote reconciliation in Rwanda \u2013 but as the fragrances of eucalyptus and pine drift through the air, I am hopeful. It\u2019s clear from the absence of street children and beggars, and the inclusive gatherings of men and women planning their collective futures, that innovative social work has made an impact. Rwandans are right to be proud: in a short timeframe, the nation has achieved unparalleled progress in reconciliation and development. Social work has played a vital role in this success. \u2022 Rory Truell is secretary-general of the International Federation of Social Workers"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
