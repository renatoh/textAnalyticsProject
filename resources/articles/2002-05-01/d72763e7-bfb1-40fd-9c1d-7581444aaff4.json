We are four days away from meeting Cameroon in our opening game in the World Cup finals. I believe it will be our most difficult and important group game. Get something out of Saturday and we can think positively about our chances of progress. We all must keep telling ourselves this. I do. Then I retreat to my room. I don't know about the others but, when I get there, I stare at the ceiling and think of Roy Keane. I can't help it. I try to combat it but I'd be lying if I said I haven't been dwelling on it all. I've known Roy a long time, as long as anyone in the Irish set-up, and while I wouldn't claim to know him well, we do go back, we have a shared experience. It feels like that has gone somehow. It scarcely needs saying that this has been an extremely difficult week and it's left me with a heavy heart. I'm sure I'm not alone. The whole of Ireland has become embroiled in this affair from the Taoiseach down because, no matter what you may hear elsewhere, no other country enjoys and celebrates a World Cup like Ireland. It's our national jubilee and now it has been tarnished. Thousands have been raising funds for the trip of a lifetime and now they have seen their team robbed of its best player. No wonder a nation has been split. Part of the difficulty for us is that we have been cocooned from the debate raging at home. We are getting snippets and, from what I've read and been told, there is a fair amount of inaccuracy. The hysteria that surrounded Roy's interview on RTE last night was another example of this. I will not tell you what was said in the meeting last Thursday night that ended with Roy's expulsion from the squad, because as a squad we have agreed that no one will reveal the intimate details. What I can do is clear up a few misconceptions that have been transformed into the perceived truth. First of all I would like to state categorically that the rest of the players did not want this, did not engineer it and most certainly did not clap when Roy was expelled. Furthermore Roy's apparent belief that \"senior players\" had held a meeting with Mick McCarthy prior to the fateful one is totally wrong. Steve Staunton, Alan Kelly and myself are dumbfounded by the suggestion of a conspiracy - or to use Roy's words \"a betrayal\". Roy's departure has left us in a catastrophic position and the idea that the players are somehow happy about that is absolute rubbish. No one here feels good about what has happened; in fact, on a human level we are all devastated for him. We know what Roy means, as a player, as a man and as a huge character in Irish life. All of us know and have shared the sense of Irish pride at seeing Roy become the most significant footballer at the biggest club in Britain. I've known Roy since his Nottingham Forest days and to watch him develop into a world-class player has filled me with the same pride as others. But Roy's tirade of abuse last Thursday was a step too far. I've been regretting ever since that I did not literally jump on him halfway through it and gag him. I know I will regret that forever. Once it had finished and Roy had left the room I was the first person to speak. I asked if the situation was retrievable but even the greatest optimist on the planet would have known it wasn't. We the players knew that we had to back Mick McCarthy 100% and that's what we are doing. It was political, it was human, it was personal and it was hugely painful, but Roy cannot say that he is the victim. He is one victim. There are others, many others and he will know that. Another thing that has been said is that Roy's non-appearance at my testimonial was at the root of it. It wasn't. I knew Roy was not coming to Sunderland the day before the game. (Thank you by the way, we've nearly reached the \u00a31m). Mick rang me to tell me that Roy was staying in Manchester to receive treatment on an injury. I was fine about it. It was only when we got to Dublin the next day and the papers there made a huge deal of it that things changed. Roy had a go at some reporters and I suppose you could sense then that things could become difficult; we were due to have a barbecue with the press when we got to Saipan. We still had it and Roy turned up but there was a mood brewing. The only time we escaped it was our visit to Suicide Cliff in Saipan, where the Japanese, women and children first, threw themselves into the sea backwards rather than recognise America's victory at the end of World War II. It should give all this some perspective. Roy went and I was still OK with him then, even though it had come out that he had also refused to write a piece for my testimonial programme. I was disappointed about that at the time but I hadn't realised the depth of his antipathy toward the journalist compiling the programme. Roy had apologised to me about that as soon as he got to Dublin airport the Wednesday after the match at Sunderland. He didn't even unpack before doing so and we had dinner together that night. I said no offence had been taken, I felt I was almost apologetic to him. So there was no plot, no scheme to oust him. It was when he erupted that it all started and, while I feel for him to a certain point, it is my duty to feel for and to concentrate more on the young players around me and Saturday's game. As of now we must lose the burden of this regretful atmosphere and look forward. We've had one practice match and won it, the facilities here are fantastic - if only he'd waited a day - and we watched videos of Cameroon yesterday. They are the African champions, the bookies' favourites for the group and we must concern ourselves with them now. It is time to move on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
