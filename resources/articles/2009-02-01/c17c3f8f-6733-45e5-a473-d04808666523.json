As more than 2,000 complaints poured in yesterday about the \"unprecedented technical error\" that led to almost seven million viewers missing the winning goal in Wednesday night's Merseyside derby two minutes from the end of extra-time, it was probably not quite the buzz for which he was hoping. Grade, who has made football a key plank of his plan to try to resuscitate the broadcaster and spent heavily on rights, has often claimed that it is hard to match the drama of sport. Yesterday he tried to minimise the damage. \"As a football fan I was as disappointed as anyone to miss the goal,\" he said. \"Last night's glitch was inexcusable and we are awaiting the results of our technical inquiry so we can put in place stringent and immediate procedures to address this.\" It is believed an automated playout system designed for use on nights when the schedule is fixed had not been updated to take into account the possibility of extra-time. The fact that the match was running 13 minutes late was also cited as a factor. It was \"bad luck\" that the incident happened during just about the only moment of note during two hours of football. Those watching in northern regions cut back to the match just in time to see the goal go in but those in the south missed it altogether. By the time pictures returned, they could see only a mass of Everton players celebrating on the ground. The damage to ITV could amount to more than having to placate disgruntled viewers. The Football Association yesterday demanded an explanation from its new broadcast partner, amid rising concern in some quarters about the potential long-term implications of its decision to hand the FA Cup rights to ITV and Setanta. An FA spokesman said it would be seeking a \"full explanation\" from ITV. \"It is obviously very disappointing that viewers and fans did not see the only goal of last night's FA Cup replay between Everton and Liverpool,\" he added. \"It is important that lessons are learned and that this does not happen again.\" ITV and Setanta paid \u00a3425m to win the rights to the FA Cup and England internationals from the BBC and Sky in 2007. The decision caused fury among BBC executives, who claim they were not given a fair chance to submit a new bid and accused the FA of overlooking the job it had done in rebuilding the reputation of the Cup by harnessing the power of its television channels, radio and websites. In response the FA chief executive, Brian Barwick, argued the deal was a good one financially and claimed it would benefit the FA Cup. But, after praise for its indepth treatment of early rounds, ITV's FA Cup coverage this season has at times appeared cursed. Its live match in the second round, Histon v Leeds, provided a shock but struggled for clear pictures through driving rain. Then ITV had to apologise after broadcasting swearing fans on the pitch and naked players in the dressing room.Worse was to come in the third round. Having gambled on sending its trucks to Forest Green, it showed extensive coverage of the non-league team's defeat by Derby County at the top of its highlights programme while the real stories of the day \u2013 Nottingham Forest humbling Manchester City and Southend's late equaliser at Stamford Bridge \u2013 were afforded the kind of coverage last seen on a regional news goals round-up in the mid-1970s. And while the fourth round was not quite as bad \u2013 until Wednesday night \u2013 the broadcaster played its part in a weekend of headlines that once again agonised over the death of the FA Cup. An attractive draw was undermined by weakened teams, talk of scrapping replays and a lack of shocks. While audiences remained healthy, several commentators said the decision to hand the rights to ITV and Setanta was looking less sensible as the competition's saliency drained away. ITV insiders yesterday said the run of bad luck was not a direct consequence of the departure of the former director of news and sport Mark Sharman, who left the broadcaster at Christmas. The job he did in restoring the reputation of ITV Sport, winning plaudits for its Champions League and formula one coverage, has been undermined by an unhappy cup run. Meanwhile, one Everton fan that Grade will be kicking himself for upsetting is the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, who will soon help decide ITV's future in a broadcasting review. Having returned from Zurich, where he was part of a delegation meeting Fifa to launch England's 2018 World Cup bid, he settled down to watch in Westminster and was among the millions who missed out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
