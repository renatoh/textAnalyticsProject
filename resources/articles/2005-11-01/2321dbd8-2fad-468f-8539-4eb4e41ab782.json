England have qualified for the World Cup but none of the other home nations has even made the play-offs. How different it would feel if Scotland, one of the Irelands or Wales had finished second in their group. Having been involved in three international play-offs, I can say that there is no week quite like it. People have equated these World Cup play-offs with FA Cup ties, in that it is win or bust. I can assure you, it is no FA Cup tie. When Switzerland host Turkey tomorrow, say, both teams will feel the weight of a nation on their shoulders. That is some burden. A classic FA Cup tie produces great drama, of course, the David and Goliath factor. But when countries meet in play-offs they have generally been satisfactory in the qualification group and are of a comparable level. What they have beyond the FA Cup is the enormous pressure of national expectation; every player enters the games knowing that a mistake or a goal will leave an indelible mark on their nation's sporting history. Somewhere like Turkey, the game transcends sport. These matches will be part of Turkey's daily life and conversation and the outcome will have an effect on how the country views itself. Streets will be emptied and, as Turkey know to their cost from 2003 when they lost to Latvia, failure brings angst. On these occasions football has a broader impact on national self-esteem. For the Republic of Ireland, our emergence as a country that qualified for major finals was part of our growing confidence as a modern European state. But there were losses along the way. I will not forget November 1999 when we took a 1-1 draw at Lansdowne Road to rural Turkey for the second leg, drew 0-0 and did not make it to Euro 2000. Rather than play the game in Istanbul, the Turks moved the second leg to Bursa. It took a plane, a bus, a rickety ferry and then another bus to get there. The training pitch was diabolical, the stadium at Bursa not much better. As the Turks say: welcome to hell. Turkey's confidence benefited greatly from that play-off and 21/2 years later they were in a World Cup semi-final against Brazil. Things have not gone to plan since Japan but the shock of the Latvia defeat should inspire them to overcome Switzerland. The Swiss finished above the Republic of Ireland in the group but I still believe that man for man we were superior to them. Were we hosting the Turks tomorrow I think we would stand a better chance of beating them than Switzerland because of that, but also because we triumphed in our last play-off. The pressure on these occasions is so intense that experience is a huge attribute. Without having lost to Turkey in 1999, to Belgium in 1997, and before that to Holland in 1995, we would not have known how to beat Iran in 2001. The importance of a clean sheet at home in the first leg was now the priority for us. Turkey and Belgium had left Dublin with a 1-1 draw. We beat Iran 2-0 at home, Ian Harte and Robbie Keane scoring and, though we travelled to Tehran for the return without our captain Roy Keane, we felt the clean sheet was protection enough. So it proved, but only just. Iran missed a few chances and eventually scored in the 90th minute. A goal in Dublin as well and Iran would have been through. Had that been our first taste of the play-offs I am sure we would have lost. Turkey was intimidating but nothing like Tehran. Having a street named after Bobby Sands shocked us but it was nothing compared to the atmosphere at the stadium. Our kit man, as usual, went to the stadium a few hours early to prepare the kit, medical supplies etc. He came back with the worrying information that the 110,000-capacity ground was already full. He noted that there were some fires lit on the concrete terraces. The noise was, I can confirm, extraordinary. Extraordinary is the best way to sum up these weeks. I wish we were involved again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
