But that's the uncommon position in which California songstress Katy Perry \u2013 nee Hudson, briefly Brand \u2013 finds herself. Back in August the two singers' new singles \u2013 Roar by Perry, Applause by Gaga \u2013 came out the same day. The clash was unscheduled, forced by leaks, but the victory was unambiguous. In that first week, Roar (an anthem of female empowerment throughout which Perry's breakup from Russell Brand throbs like a bassline) trounced Applause (a club-facing meditation on the fan-fame helix) by a factor of more than two to one. Perry's last album, 2010's Teenage Dream, sent five singles to the US No 1 spot, the first for a female artist in 53 years. Gaga's Born This Way didn't; but then her first album, The Fame, basically rebooted the entire music industry back in 2008/9. Now it's third album time and both singers are re-arming in block capitals. There may be a cordon sanitaire of three weeks between Prism, Perry's album, and Artpop, Gaga's, due out on 11 November, but battle is joined once more. Having only heard a handful of Gaga's new tracks live it would be wrong to start second-guessing Artpop here. But you suspect that Perry's Prism \u2013 a record so female it should be subtitled \"You go, girl\" \u2013 might soak up autumn-to-Christmas sales better than a concept album about pop itself. Musically, Prism remains the work of alpha male hit-makers Dr Luke and Max Martin, whose credits are literally too numerous to list. Lyrically, though, it's replete with the California new age lingua franca of self-help, mantras, third eyes, astrology and yogic navel-examining, all wrapped up in the woman-wronged aura of a girl dumped by text message. Divorce can do terrible things to people, even pop stars. By the Grace of God \u2013 a kind of vulnerable yin to Roar's righteous yang \u2013 is the album's closing confessional. It starts off with just piano, vocals and a line about Perry's Saturn returning. Ghastly mid-tempo beats find her on her bathroom floor, contemplating suicide. From the title on in the track is ridden with cliche, but one line sings out, casting Perry as Everywoman, blaming herself when cads go wrong: \"We were living on a fault line/ And I felt the fault was all mine.\" You can't quite hear the stampede for gin and chocolates, but this is where the readers of women's mags hop on board, empathising furiously. Many of these more, ahem, contemplative songs may be thin on Perry's former playfulness and long on the stuff of Eckhart Tolle, but a kind of girly simpatico sustains them and transfers easily to the stronger tracks, where Perry's back in the game. Leaving aside Unconditionally, the ungainly, adverbial power ballad in which Perry's fondness for musician John Mayer might be writ large, these are a hoot. Walking On Air is a hilarious 90s-house throwback (\"You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy,\" Perry sings). Birthday is another metaphor-happy period piece (70s funk, via 80s pop) in which coitus is confused with birthday cake. Legendary Lovers, meanwhile, has something of Bollywood in the production; a pounding anthem that flattens the jungle around it like a herd of elephants. This Is How We Do may be a half-rapped, faux-urban west coast pose, but it's a sequel of sorts to both California Gurls, and Last Friday Night (TGIF), Perry's previous party-hearty mega-hits. Eyes dried, shades back on, Perry is hanging with her homegirls. They're on the prowl for tacos and \"hotties\", \"sucking really bad at Mariah Carey-oke\". They understand her, and they're washing that man right out of her hair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
