Murrayfield is fast emerging as Hearts' favoured option as they step up their search for a new ground. Tynecastle, with a capacity of only 18,000 and a pitch not big enough to satisfy some Uefa requirements for international games, is considered to be past it by a club who like to think of themselves as the third force in football north of the border. The facilities are well past their best in most respects and, because of the pitch dimensions, Tynecastle cannot be considered for hosting events such as European Championship under-21 matches, the finals of which Scotland will bid to stage if Rainer Bonhof's side beat Croatia in next month's play-off. Those finals are in May and already the Scottish Football Association is taking the Croatia fixture to Easter Road, the Hibernian ground which has been earmarked for end-of-season games if Scotland are successful. Murrayfield, just a long conversion kick from Tynecastle, is an ideal alternative for Hearts although a green-field site in Straiton, on the outskirts of the capital, is another possibility. \"This will be the biggest decision the club has made in 100 years so we must get it right,\" said their chief executive Chris Robertson. \"Now it is time to move things along. I would like us to make a decision by the end of this season.\" Negotiations with the SRU are understood to be ongoing although right now those who matter with the oval-ball sport's governing body are all Down Under. That has brought talks to a temporary halt although it has not stopped Hearts from doing their homework. The Hearts manager Craig Levein has taken his squad to play a friendly at Murrayfield, and the reports were favourable. \"It was a good exercise and the surface was excellent,\" said Peter Houston, the club's assistant manager. \"Both Craig and the Dundee manager Jim Duffy were happy, and the facilities are magnificent. It is very like Hampden Park, with huge dressing rooms, and, in general terms, was quite special. We had no complaints whatsoever.\" Inevitably there will be tears when the move happens as Tynecastle is arguably the most atmospheric of Scottish grounds, particularly when Hibs or the Old Firm visit, for the crowd are virtually on top of the players. Moreover, it has been Hearts' home since 1886. For the rest of this season they will maintain a watching brief on the Straiton site, where it is conceivable they could share with Hibs, but Murrayfield, with its facilities and proximity to Tynecastle, is an obvious attraction although the new site would allow a purpose-built ground close to the Edinburgh bypass. The only certainty is that they will move somewhere. Aside from all else, Hearts could do with the estimated \u00a325m they would get from developers for a residential site on prime land only 10 minutes' drive from Princes Street in the capital, where prices are going through the roof. So Hearts know they can cash in, wipe off their sizeable debt and still have money to spend on an alternative. They would probably also be able to release funds to Levein, their impressive young manager, who has rebuilt his squad by getting rid of big earners while dabbling, with some success, in the free-transfer market. Saturday's 5-0 humiliation against Celtic aside, they have players such as Steven Pressley and Andy Webster in the full Scotland squad and are still in the Uefa Cup. Levein knows he must invest in the team if Hearts really want to go up to another level. It is a huge decision for the club but one they will not rush - though it is becoming a matter of increasing urgency."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
