Right here, right now.' Praise indeed from Aidan, 14, who usually enthuses only about computer games or the latest NME. 'You're not stressed about me emptying the dishwasher. Dad's not stressed ...' Dad chimes in: 'I'm not stressed because I'm not at work.' Never mind work, we're none of us doing anything that might be called a chore. We're sitting in warm sunshine by an infinity pool, because we're spending half term in northern Greece's only five-star all-inclusive hotel, the Oceania Club in Halkidiki. And it is so very different from our usual holidays. I spent much of my youth vagabonding around Europe - seasonal work, au pairing, Inter-Railing. Now, trying to prove I am still 22 at heart, I force my poor family on 'real', 'independent' holidays, dragging them from budget airport to dodgy campsite, via bus station and cheap back-street hotel. Not this time. 'The only way this holiday could be less effort would be if somebody else went on it for you,' says Aidan. It's a two-hour 45-minute flight to Thessaloniki, and a 30-minute complimentary taxi ride to the hotel. Then family and luggage are taken by buggy to our suite, where slippers and bathrobes, fresh fruit and wine await. This hits the spot perfectly. Some torrid weeks at our respective offices, GCSE coursework for one child and a piano exam for the other, plus having work done on the house, have left us all careworn and snappish. It's nice to realise, after a few days' pampered indolence, that I'm not a snarling harridan deep down, and as a family we actually quite like each other. And it is a relief to relinquish the mammoth task and expense of keeping a growing 14-year-old fed. The meals at Oceania Club are abundant and, for buffet food, of a generally high standard. The ever-ravenous lad thinks he's in heaven, but the rest of us tuck in too - as though we spent our days digging in the fields, rather than wandering from sun lounger to beach bar, sometimes taking the stairs rather than the lift to work up an appetite. It's late October, so mornings and evenings are cool, but the sun comes out most days. It's surreal but delightful to lie by a pool making plans for Halloween and Bonfire Night the following week. But though the sunshine is warm, the water isn't. On the first day Laura, 12, slides elegantly into the swimming pool - only to exit in shock as if she's on a spring. At the beach, the clear blue Aegean can't really be as cold as the North Sea of my Yorkshire childhood, but it feels that way. The hardy young folk soon get used to it, but when we all take out canoes one afternoon the children are under strict orders that Mum and Dad are not for capsizing. There is a lot to be said for an all-inclusive deal if you want a week of family harmony. So many things cease to be an issue. Pancakes for breakfast? Over there, being freshly cooked for you. Can we have a pedalo? Of course, ask the nice man. Another drink? Off you go to the bar. (Can one week of unlimited sugary drinks do too much damage?) My husband develops a taste for pina coladas, but finds the lurid green ouzo esquire (with blue curacao and orange juice) a cocktail too far. We spend our days reading and playing cards, are beaten at the pool bar quiz by a scary German family, and manage an occasional hour of table tennis. Aidan comes back weary but triumphant after a long game of beach volleyball. Oceania Club is so shiny, clean and new, we relish the contrast when we walk along the beach into the cheerfully scruffy town of Nea Moudania. It doesn't have a charming old quarter, it doesn't even have many intact pavements, but it does have a harbour front where old men in improbably large berets play cards and fiddle with worry beads, and a pretty church. At the sprawling market, we half-regret our all-inclusive status as we ogle stalls of fish, olives, bread, and borlotti beans so plump and fresh they would make Nigel Slater weep. Next to a vendor of cheap T-shirts, a Greek Orthodox priest snoozes behind a stall selling icons, incense and worry beads. Old women stagger home with cabbages fully 18 inches across. The hotel, when we go back, feels like some parallel universe: we've got an a la carte dinner in the Mahi Mahi Asian restaurant, followed by a comedy show (in English and German) at the nightclub or Spiderman 2 in the hotel cinema. We take a taxi to the fishing village of Afitos on the other side of the Kassandra peninsula. It is all charming stone houses and stunning views. But after we have settled into a clifftop taverna and ordered lunch for four, including prawns as big as your hand, we realise we have been cosseted too long. In the real world, people don't saunter up to bars, order what they like and waltz off. They pay for what they consume. 'Have you got your wallet?' 'No, have you?' 'Maybe they'll take a credit card.' 'The cards are all back at the hotel.' 'Is there a cashpoint?' 'What good will that do us with no cards?' But we are spared learning the Greek for washing up: the bill is so small we can pay with the cash in our back pockets and have enough for the taxi back. From the cliff top at Afitos you get a splendid view of the other two fingers of Halkidiki: Sithonia and, most intriguingly, the semi-autonomous theocratic state of Mount Athos. It is said the Virgin Mary was forced by bad weather to land here 2,000 years ago. Taken by its natural beauty, she called upon her son in heaven to make it hers. The entire peninsula is dedicated to Mary, and the Byzantine emperor Monomachos later decreed that no other woman should ever get to enjoy its wooded gorges and sparkling streams. So half the human race is banned from setting foot on Mount Athos. Female domestic animals are banned, too - except hens, whose eggs are needed for icon painting. Today gaining access to this world of 20 monasteries where, presumably, the toilet lids are never put down, is, well, Byzantine. Only 14 foreigners a day are allowed to land (access is by boat only) and they have to apply in writing to Greece's foreign ministry months in advance, confirm this two weeks ahead and present themselves at the Pilgrims' Bureau in Thessaloniki the day before travelling. Once through these hoops however, men and boys can stay on Mount Athos for up to four days, sleeping in guest houses, sharing the monks' food and attending services. We'll just have to take their word for it, girls. The Christian god is a latecomer in these parts, of course. Across the Thermaic Gulf from Oceania Club lies Mount Olympus, home of the Greek deities. We are told you can sometimes see its peak. That's another thing we'll have to take their word for - it's far too hazy. But these marbled halls are more than palatial, and with a little imagination the copious fare at the buffet restaurant could stand in for ambrosia. We may not have dancing nymphs, but there is a team of animateurs to entertain us each night. And yes, after a week's sun and relaxation my husband really is looking like a Greek god. Honest.
