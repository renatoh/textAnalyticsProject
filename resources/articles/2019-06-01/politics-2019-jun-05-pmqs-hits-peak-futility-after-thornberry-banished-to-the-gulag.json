It had been bad enough that she had completely outshone her leader every time she had deputised for him at prime minister\u2019s questions. But then she had compounded her crime by going freelance after the EU elections and rewriting Labour\u2019s policy on a second referendum. So exile it was. Not that the shadow foreign secretary was going to take being airbrushed out of history lightly. On Tuesday night, the Labour leader\u2019s office had insisted her axing from PMQs was due to her attending the D-day commemorations, but Thornberry was quick out of the blocks to point out she was not invited to Portsmouth and would be going to the ones in Normandy the day after instead. To underline the point, she took her seat halfway down the opposition frontbench for Wednesday\u2019s PMQs, her face and body language the model of disloyal loyalty. Or loyal disloyalty. Take your pick. A combination that Thornberry has managed to perfect over years of training. And one that will have done her leadership ambitions no harm at all among many Labour MPs and members. In her place was the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, a woman not noted for being that quick on her feet. Or off them, for that matter. OK, she would definitely be better than Jeremy Corbyn because you\u2019d need to be technically brain-dead not to be. But not that much better. A safe pair of hands. Someone who could be relied on to put in a solid, if uninspired performance and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 to stay on message. To stick to any script. However bad. Long-Bailey warmed up with an easy swipe at Theresa May\u2019s failure to contradict Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that the NHS would be up for grabs in any future trade deal between the US and the UK. Over the past two years, it has often felt that PMQs has been an exercise in pointlessness, with one party leader who doesn\u2019t know how to ask the right questions and another who can\u2019t answer them. But now we have hit peak futility. A flat-lining, absentee prime minister and a government whose only commitment is to do nothing until after the Tory leadership election is over. And after, if possible. All of which suited David Lidington, May\u2019s de facto deputy, just fine. Now he didn\u2019t even have to worry about getting things wrong, as there were no policies he could possibly contradict. He could literally make it up as he went along. For a brief moment, he knew what it meant to be inside Trump\u2019s mind. If Trump and mind weren\u2019t some kind of oxymoron. Lidington began by making fun of Thornberry\u2019s relegation. She affected to be outraged, but couldn\u2019t totally disguise her pleasure. If there\u2019s one thing worse than being talked about, it\u2019s not being talked about and at least her absence had been noted. And anything to embarrass Corbyn. It\u2019s not just May\u2019s job that is under threat. That done, Lidington started to play Just a Minute, where he could say any old bollocks provided there was no deviation, hesitation or repetition. People had badly misjudged Trump. The president had been totally preoccupied by D for Donald day and hadn\u2019t really understood that the National Health Service had anything to do with health. So when he said he wanted the NHS to be on the table for any future trade deals what he meant was the precise opposite. And in any case, even if the NHS was on the table, any future Tory leader would take it back off unless they chose to leave it on. Long-Bailey appeared doubtful but let it go and moved on to climate change. How could the Tories claim to be taking the emergency seriously when several of the leadership contenders had expressed doubts about the science and the government had lied about meeting its own targets? Lidington was outraged. What was this obsession with the truth? Surely Long-Bailey hadn\u2019t come in to politics expecting honesty? And in any case Labour were planning to reopen the coal mines. \u201cIt is not Labour policy to reopen coal mines,\u201d Long-Bailey declared firmly. Dennis Skinner and several other Labour MPs looked horrified. As did several old hands on the opposition frontbench. Hadn\u2019t she understood that the whole point of Corbyn\u2019s \u201chonest and straightforward\u201d politics was that it should be neither honest nor straightforward. The idea was to be as ambiguous as possible. The shadow business secretary had committed the same schoolgirl error as Thornberry and would now join her in the gulags. Angela Rayner\u2019s eyes lit up. Her time would come. And much sooner than she had imagined."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
