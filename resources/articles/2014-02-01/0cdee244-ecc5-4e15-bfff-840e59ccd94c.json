The former home secretary had told Sally Anderson in 2005 that he hoped whoever had leaked information about them would \"rot in hell\" after a story appeared in the Daily Mail about his \"close friendship with her\". He also expressed regret that the press had intruded into her life, Andrew Edis, prosecuting, told the phone-hacking trial. \"Unbeknownst to Mr Blunkett, it was Sally Anderson herself who had given the information to the Daily Mail about their relationship,\" Edis said. She had been in \"open contact\" with the newspaper, \"speaking to them about her relationship with Mr Blunkett\" and that three reports of what she said to them appeared in the paper. The revelation that she had been leaking information to the press was part of an admission agreed between the prosecution and the defence team for Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor who is accused of conspiring to intercept voicemails, a charge he denies. Two months ago, the jury were played a voicemail from Blunkett telling her \"someone very, very close has done a really phenomenal piece of work on destroying both our lives\". On Wednesday Edis told jurors: \"It was Sally Anderson who had orchestrated the media coverage of her relationship with Mr Blunkett.\" Anderson admitted lying to the Sunday People after she sold a story to the newspaper claiming she could have been pregnant by Blunkett, who sued the paper and Anderson for libel. She publically retracted what she said about him in 2006, the court heard. \"Contrary to what I said to the newspaper, Mr Blunkett was not my lover and could not have made me pregnant.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
