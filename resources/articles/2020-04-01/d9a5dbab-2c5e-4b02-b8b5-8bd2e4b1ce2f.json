The Australian university sector has been thrown into financial turmoil since the coronavirus pandemic began, with border closures and forced campus shutdowns crippling revenue and forcing some universities to make drastic budget cuts. Faced with the possibility of wide-scale job losses among its members, on 3 April the national leadership of the National Tertiary Education Union held talks to plan their strategy to respond to the crisis. The national executive made a series of resolutions that were to either be kept internal or for \u201cconfidential, limited sharing\u201d. The list of resolutions, obtained by Guardian Australia, show it ordered national officers to \u201ccommence a national level negotiation in response to the Covid-19 crisis\u201d with universities. The union resolved that \u201cconcessions may be made\u201d, including \u201cconcessions on pay\u201d, which could include a pay freeze, deferral of increments, or \u201cin extreme circumstances, temporary general reductions in Agreement rates\u201d. Such concessions would only be made if they were needed to prevent job losses, the union resolved, and would only be made as a \u201clast resort\u201d. Any cuts that were conceded would need to be made in a way that protected lower-paid workers and had \u201ca greater effect on higher salary earners\u201d. \u201cAny salary concessions should be accompanied by relatively larger cuts in VC/senior executive salary packages,\u201d the union resolved. But the decision has prompted furious backlash from within the union\u2019s membership. More than 500 members, many of them senior academics from universities across Australia, have now signed a petition rejecting the NTEU\u2019s position and attacking its leadership for not consulting with them before passing the resolution. \u201cWe reject concessions to our wages and conditions,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cThere is no guarantee that sacrificing hard won conditions will save a single job [and] many of us live in households with people who have already lost jobs or hours, and can\u2019t afford more sacrifice. [If] workers in some of the richest institutions in Australia decide to give up conditions, it sets a terrible precedent for workers everywhere.\u201d A meeting of about 150 member activists on Thursday, convened by the union\u2019s RMIT branch, censured the union for proposing that \u201cour members sacrifice pay and conditions to cover losses\u201d, while calling on the government to provide added assistance by covering all lost student revenue. The activists unanimously resolved to campaign against any loss of pay or conditions, and urged the union to convene state and federal meetings for members. \u201cWe commit to escalating actions to defend our pay, conditions and jobs \u2013 up to and including industrial action,\u201d the members said. The NTEU\u2019s general secretary, Matthew McGowan, said the union had been forced to move quickly to try to protect jobs in a rapidly evolving crisis. \u201cAs you\u2019ve seen \u2026 workers are actually finding themselves out of work almost overnight, and our fear is that this is going to happen in universities very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve moved very quickly to try and address that problem, and to try and do what we can to protect people\u2019s jobs and their income.\u201d McGowan said he welcomed the debate on the union\u2019s position and would ensure that members were consulted widely. No agreement would be finalised without member endorsement, he said. The union had communicated its plans with members in an email on 8 April, he said, less than a week after the national executive resolutions and initial talks with Universities Australia. But furious members say the email did not disclose the resolution to consider negotiating pay cuts. After the email from the union\u2019s leadership outlining parts of their position last week, branch members from the University of Sydney passed a motion censuring the leadership and opposing \u201cpunitive cost-save measures\u201d. The motion demanded that the NTEU \u201cnot make substantial offers to the government or employers\u201d without convening a vote of members. Nick Riemer, an academic at Sydney university, called the NTEU\u2019s position a \u201cvery serious breach of solidarity\u201d. \u201cNot only is the NTEU leadership signalling that pay losses are OK; it\u2019s also giving managements a green light to throw casualised staff under the bus,\u201d he said. Other branches have since followed. The University of Melbourne passed a motion censuring the NTEU leadership \u201cfor undercutting our industrial and political response by already offering wage and conditions concessions to our employers\u201d. Members at the Victoria University voted to express its deep concern about the position and demanded \u201cthe rescinding of any deal already negotiated\u201d. Fleur Taylor, a member of the Victoria University branch, said staff felt the union was entertaining concessions on pay and conditions before properly campaigning for federal government support. On Thursday RMIT staff said they would \u201cprepare a vigorous campaign to urge members to vote \u2018no\u2019 to concessions on conditions and pay\u201d and committed to \u201cescalating actions to defend our pay, conditions and jobs \u2013 up to and including industrial action\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
