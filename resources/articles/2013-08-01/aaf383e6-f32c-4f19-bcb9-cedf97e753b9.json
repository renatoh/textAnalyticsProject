They were actually renting from him. And the piece was incorrect when it said the MP owns three homes in the area: he owns two. \"The man who stood on O'Connell bridge\" (New Review, last week, pages 14-15), the illustrated story of Arthur Fields, the Dublin photographer, carried an incorrect caption. A 1950s image we said showed American film star Gene Tierney with an unknown man actually showed Movita (Marlon Brando's second wife) and the boxer/singer Jack Doyle. The headline \"The fruit fly: our ancestors of 800 million years\" (Discover, last week, page 22) was inaccurate. As the article explained, fruit flies are our very distant evolutionary cousins \u2013 the basic pattern of our bodies is dictated by the Hox genes we share. Those genes also patterned a common ancestor from 800 million years ago (actually not a fly but a very simple multicellular organism that lived in the sea).
