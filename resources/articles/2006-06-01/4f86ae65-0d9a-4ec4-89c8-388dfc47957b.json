It is an accolade that we appreciate. But if you live by league tables you should probably expect to perish by them. That is not a mistake Oxford can afford to make. A university with nine centuries of history and a worldwide reputation knows complacency can never be a friend. In fact from my experience as vice-chancellor, Oxford seems more inclined to be anxious than complacent. But is anxiety any more appropriate than complacency? There are certainly areas where it might be considered negligent not to feel some concern. The wilder threats from animal extremists, for instance. Informed debate on animal testing does not trouble us; the academic freedom we champion wouldn't count for much if it did. But those who want to use violence to short-circuit debate must surely worry us all. We also continue to work tirelessly at admissions and access issues, with the clear aim of admitting the most talented students, regardless of personal circumstance. Then there are the concerns about university finance. No university is immune from such anxieties. The scale of Oxford's income and endowments might lead some to retort that these are financial problems they would like to have. But perhaps the real issue here is about commanding the resources to meet your defining aspirations. Depending on what and where you are in higher education these may vary widely, but the basic challenge is one we all share. So when it comes to finance at Oxford Universitywe worry about the yawning gap between what undergraduate education costs and what (even with tuition fees) we are likely to receive; about how to attract and retain gifted teachers, researchers and lecturers (a challenge that will not be resolved by the current pay dispute); about remaining financially competitive (despite our relative wealth) with international competitors. Should Oxford's anxieties worry anyone else? Part of the answer points back to league tables. Whatever global, as opposed to national, rankings you take, only two universities in Europe consistently make the top 10: Oxford and Cambridge. Whatever these tables are measuring, the UK is clearly in a special position. And if knowledge is to be regarded as black gold for the global economy, the national interest surely requires some hard thinking about how to produce that most precious resource. It is, of course, a question both of quantity and quality. Oxford University can't have much impact on the former, but its strong international standing should speak powerfully to the latter. So Oxford's worries should be of more than local concern. But that does not mean others should resolve them all for us. If we cannot afford complacency, nor should we indulge in false modesty. Oxford's history and reputation, its research and teaching excellence, its huge academic potential are all legitimate sources of pride. An institution with these qualities must expect to take the lead in shaping its own destiny. For Oxford University a crucial part of meeting that challenge lies in its governance arrangements. These must rest securely on the fundamental principles of self-governing democracy and the primacy of scholarly activity. In practical terms, we need to be sure that major decisions made by the university - about the way it is organised and run, the way it attracts and uses resources and the way it supports its students, scholars, teachers and researchers - are of the highest standard, and are recognised as such internally and externally. In the last decade Oxford has devoted considerable time and effort to governance. It is no accident that this coincides with a time of rapid growth for a highly complex institution with more than 40 independent colleges and halls, and scores of academic departments, schools and institutes, as well the world's largest university press and internationally renowned libraries and collections. In the same period, income and expenditure have doubled, research revenues have tripled, student numbers have grown by 20%, and many new departments have opened. Governance is about setting the right framework for this dynamism and diversity. The recommendations newly published in our university's white paper seek to do that. They are designed to allow Oxford to take greater advantage of outside expertise without compromising academic self-government, to encourage effective planning and action without sacrificing democratic control, and to meet contemporary challenges and expectations without diluting Oxford's scholarly values and priorities. The white paper is the culmination a long process of consultation across university. The main principles have been welcomed by the university council and are expected to be considered Congregation, the university's parliament, this autumn. So will this settle all our worries? of course not. Will it keep Oxford at top of the Guardian tree? We shall see. Can it help the university to remain pre-eminent force for the pursuit of knowledge, the sharing of wisdom and the service of the common good? To that, a resounding yes. \u00b7 John Hood is the vice-chancellor of Oxford University mailto:Vice-Chancellor@admin.ox.ac.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
