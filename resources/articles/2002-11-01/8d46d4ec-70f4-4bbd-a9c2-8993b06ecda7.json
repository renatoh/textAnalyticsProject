Dr Chris Perring, director of policy and practice development at the mental health act commission (MHAC), today warned there was a risk that the rights of detained patients could be ignored if the government went ahead with its plans to abolish the inspectorate and absorbed its functions into the new commission for health care audit and inspection (Chai). Addressing the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health annual conference in Bristol, Dr Perring said: \"Our concern is that the MHAC specific focus on detained patients might get lost in a large inspectorate encompassing all mental health services. We are not sure that the new Chai will maintain the priority and profile of detained patients.\" Dr Perring pointed out that the MHAC's remit, monitoring NHS and local authority mental health services, would be split between Chai and the new commission for social care inspection (CSCI), both due to launch in 2004. She said: \"The monitoring of mental health services will not be as joined up, and we want to know how the two inspectorates will share information effectively without breaching confidentiality.\" Dr Perring also expressed concern that Chai would only inspect mental health services when there was a specific reason to, while the MHAC carried out regular routine visits. \"How will they find specific reasons to visit if they don't carry out routine inspections?\" she posed. Earlier, a Department of Health (DoH) official pledged that the draft mental health bill would be amended following the huge response to the consultation on the controversial proposed legislation. But the official would not reveal when the bill might be republished and brought before parliament. She said the DoH had received more than 2,000 responses over the consultation period, which ended on September 16. \"It won't be the same document as the draft bill,\" the official added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
