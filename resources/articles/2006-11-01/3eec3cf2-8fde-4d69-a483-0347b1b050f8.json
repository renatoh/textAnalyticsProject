It's a wonder, for this liberal anyway, to go to bed on election night in a state of confusion and wake up to a happier world. Again, I'm counting my blessings. (And so should you, rest of the world; if there's one thing the senate can do, it is prevent dumb stuff from happening; though I'm not sure, in the case of a planned-for attack on Iran, that its members will be willing to assume the political risk.) But if you take a look at the Virginia race for a moment, you have to wonder just how bad things have to get before America awakes to the catastrophe its current leadership has caused. If you read any of the profiles of Allen's history - even the one before he revealed to the nation what a nincompoop he was - it was clear that this boy had no business running anything larger than a bait-and-tackle shop. Take a look here, for instance. What was Allen, in real life, save the spoiled son of a famous football coach with a fixation for all things confederate? Later on, we saw how he handled himself; doling out racial epithets and following them up with \"ethnic rallies\". Upon discovering his Jewish heritage, he announces how much he loves ham. Now that it's over, we can admit it's kind of funny. But remember, this guy was the conservative Republicans' best hope to derail the McCain campaign - a juggernaut that looks all-but-unstoppable today, at least as far as the nomination goes. What does it say about American politics that this guy almost made it to the top - or even that he came so close to getting re-elected in a year when Republicans were swimming against a political tidal wave? Much the same can be said about Jack Abramoff's close friend and crony, Conrad Burns, who throws personal corruption and a certain characterological colorfulness into the mix. The good news, even if we must endure a McCain presidency after Bush's - and the mainstream US media continues to play patsy in his pocket - is that the Republican party will have to purge itself of a number of its crazies. The \"faith-based\" faction that has been in charge has been discredited on both the political and policy front. In any case, American politics will move towards the center in the next few years; just keep in mind it's an American center, not a sensible one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
