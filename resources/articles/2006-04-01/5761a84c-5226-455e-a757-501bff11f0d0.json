If the bubble bursts, the crash in housing prices would ruin many families, as well as end Gordon Brown's reputation for economic competence. A bubble is when market prices rise far above the levels indicated by economic conditions. For example, many economists have estimated the justified, or equilibrium, level of house prices by comparing them to personal incomes, the mortgage rate and rental charges, and have frequently found that the present level of prices is 25-33% too high. If this were true, then there would only be two ways out of the problem. Either prices would need to fall by that amount, or they would need to stagnate for long enough for incomes to catch up with the \"unaffordable\" house price level. If house prices froze completely for a decade, and incomes rise at their trend rate of 4.5% a year, the market would just about be restored to equilibrium. Anyone who believes these calculations should certainly not buy a house today. But the market is not acting in such a troublesome manner. House price inflation peaked at 28% in April 2004, and fell back to -1% as mortgage rates were increased in 2004-5. But since the bottom last June, house price inflation has rebounded to 8%, and mortgage applications are now running 51% higher than they were last spring. Why has the market defied the pessimists? Quite probably because there never was a bubble in prices in the first place. John Muellbauer and his colleagues at Oxford argue that standard equations for house prices are extremely misleading because they omit several key factors, including the availability of consumer credit, regional linkages (eg between the south-east and elsewhere), stock market effects, and demographics. If you include these variables, the level of house prices in 2004 was fully justified by fundamentals. For example, the increased availability of consumer credit, on its own, has increased the justified level of house prices by 28% since 1980. However, even if there is little need to fear the bursting of a bubble, house prices could still fall if the fundamental economic drivers of the market turn unpleasant. Muellbauer runs a simulation in which inflation rises to 3% this year, mortgage interest rates jump to 6.5%, and both the economy and the stockmarket stagnate. On these pessimistic assumptions, house prices would rise by 2% in the north and the midlands, by zero in the south, and would actually fall by about 2% for two successive years in Greater London. But even on this pessimistic case, there seems very little chance that prices could decline by 14%, as they did in 1991-92, when mortgage rates rose briefly to 15%. In that depressing period, mortgage interest payments absorbed 15% of household income, while today's low interest rates have kept that ratio down to only 9% Economists are still arguing over the correct way to model the housing market, and it is easy to find pessimists arguing that the inevitable collapse will still come. But, for the moment at least, the optimists appear to have the upper hand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
