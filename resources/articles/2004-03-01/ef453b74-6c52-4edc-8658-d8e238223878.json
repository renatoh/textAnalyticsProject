The conflict in Algeria puts us off crossing to Morocco and travelling over the roof of Africa. G.Gates, by email The only feasible way to get from London to Cairo overland is via the Middle East, heading first to Istanbul and then through Syria and Jordan into Egypt. Travelling through North Africa is impossible due to the instability in Algeria and closed borders. Feasible routes can change quickly and often, so keep your eye on the regional situation while planning your trip. Some travellers head through West Africa and cross into Sudan via Chad, but this is an uncertain route which it's hard to get reliable updates on. The north-south route you're proposing, which takes in Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia en route to southern Africa, is most commonly used. You can read about other overland expeditions to South Africa and pick up planning tips at www.africa-overland.net. Wedding in Italy Our friends marry near Pisa in August, and my partner and I want to combine that with a trip to Pompeii. We'd like to spend up to a week in Naples and Pompeii before the wedding, then return to London. What is the best way to travel between Naples and Pompeii, and can we fly into Naples and out of Pisa? Finally, what should we see in Naples? We are twentysomethings and on a medium budget! Heather Hutchings, London You can do much of this trip without a car, but hiring one would allow more flexibility. You can book a flight from Stansted to Naples with EasyJet then fly home from Pisa with Ryanair. Do also check with scheduled carriers, as at peak times there may not be a much difference in price. Try British Airways (0870 850 4850). In the Naples area don't miss the raucous, anarchic city itself, the excavations at Roman Herculaneum and Pompeii, beautiful Capri and the lovely Amalfi coast. Atmospheric double rooms can be had from about \u00a355 a night at the Hotel Napolit'amo (00 39 081 552 36 26), a former palace with stylish decor. If you take a train north, the site for times and fares is www.trenitalia.com. San Gimignano is a 75-minute bus ride from Florence. Stopover in Brunei We're flying to Darwin in Australia in November with Royal Brunei airlines, and want to make a stopover. The usual one is Dubai, but as we're spending most of the day in Brunei we wondered if it's worth a stopover there instead? Mike and Veronica Burningham, Keighley Oil-rich Brunei is underrated. Bandar Seri Begawan is the calm, prosperous capital, an orderly, not terribly exciting place. You can happily spend a few days exploring the town and surrounding areas, making it a perfect stopover. The water villages of Kampung Ayer are fascinating, the Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque is impressive and the Brunei Museum and Islamic Gallery are world class. For more, visit www.tourismbrunei.com. American visas I'd already booked a break in the US Canyonlands in September when the tour firm told me that new rules mean anyone who has ever been arrested must apply for a visa. I was arrested at a CND demo 19 years ago and on the Grunwick picket line eight years before that. What are my my chances of a visa and how do I apply? Dave Esbester, London Play this one by the book, and get cracking: processing visa applications can take four to 12 weeks, and sometimes even longer. The US embassy tells us that cases are handled individually so there are no hard rules on who gets in and who doesn't. First, phone its visa information line - 09055 444546; calls cost \u00a31.30 a minute - to confirm you need to apply. Then download the forms from www.usembassy.org.uk. After filling them in, you will need to attend an interview in London. Weather at the Grand Canyon We are going to the Grand Canyon area by motor home from 15 September to 6 October. What sort of weather might we expect? Tom Jefferson, by email There will still be plenty of visitors at the Grand Canyon during this time of year. By the middle of September the weather will be cooler than in previous months, though still comfortable. The South Rim will be warmer by a couple of degrees than the North Rim, but temperatures throughout the area should be between 20C and 24C during your stay, mostly dry and cooling off towards the end of your visit. Fall, starting in late September can bring erratic and unpredictable weather so make sure you keep in touch with local forecasts. The US National Parks website has lots of practical information. A week in Europe My girlfriend and I are looking to spend a week briefly travelling around an area of Europe. We were considering flying on a low-cost airline to Stockholm, and then by train/bus/boat make our way to Malmo, Copenhagen and finally Amsterdam, spending one or two nights in each place. How easy is it to travel a route like this, and would we need to book tickets before leaving England? Tim Millard, London This is a great example of how using budget airlines can open up an adventurous multi-stop European holiday. You can do this route by also using fast continental trains: Stockholm to Copenhagen via Malmo and the \u00d8resundsbron bridge takes four hours on the X2000 fast train. It's a day (or night) trip on to Amsterdam from there. That said, there's enough to see in all these cities to justify spending a little longer - visiting two of the three would still make for a varied week, and it might be more relaxing. Stockholm, in particular, shouldn't be underrated - it has excellent museums, parks and galleries and a day's boat excursion into the nearby archipelago is a must. Three days is the minimum to get a taste of the city. It's worth booking accommodation in advance as these cities are all popular with visitors, but except during public holidays you should be able to book train tickets when you're there. If you are sure of your plans you can book for any train that passes through Germany via Deutsche Bahn UK (0870 243 53 63), and most other trips can be booked through Rail Europe (08705 848848). Reserve your flights as soon as possible to get best deals. \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall from Lonely Planet addresses as many as possible here.
