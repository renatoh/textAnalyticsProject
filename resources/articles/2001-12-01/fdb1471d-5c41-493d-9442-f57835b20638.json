After the world No1 Lleyton Hewitt's baseline game had failed on \"foreign soil\" - namely grass specially laid down on Melbourne Park's showcase hardcourt - Rafter's retrieval of the tie against France helped vindicate the expensive decision to bring in the turf. The dual Wimbledon finalist utilised his grasscourt skills sublimely to level the final at 1-1 after Hewitt had succumbed, once more on grass, to Nicolas Escude. The home captain John Fitzgerald, looking to lead Australia to a 28th Davis Cup triumph, will demand a more complete performance from Adelaide's US Open champion in tomorrow's reverse singles. For this morning's doubles Fitzgerald had Todd Woodbridge and Wayne Arthurs pencilled in to play Cedric Pioline and Fabrice Santoro, but last night said he was considering pitching in Hewitt or Rafter in a late switch. But last night belonged to Rafter. A capacity crowd, which included the prime minister John Howard, acclaimed the Queenslander's return to form after a miserable three-match losing run at the recent season-ending Masters Cup in Sydney. He was beaten there by Grosjean but on a synthetic surface, and here the French No1 had no answer to Rafter's classic grasscourt game. Rafter defied the tendinitis pain from his chronically sore right arm to serve and volley his way to a 6-3, 7-6, 7-5 victory. There have been few players more dedicated to Australia's team than Rafter but, for all his efforts, the 28-year-old is still waiting to get his hands on the trophy. Injury forced him to miss the 1999 victory over France and he retired hurt in last year's defeat by Spain in Barcelona. \"It feels really good to contribute - to go out there one-nil down and give the team what it needed was really rewarding for me,\" Rafter said. Rafter took the opening set with a single break then recovered from a break down in the second to force a tiebreak. Grosjean held triple set point at 6-3 in the tiebreak but a rampant Rafter won the next five points in succession to steal the second set. The third set also looked to be heading towards a tiebreak when the first 11 games all went with serve but Rafter stepped up a gear at 6-5 to break Grosjean a third time and claim the straight-sets victory that suited his arm fine. \"Right now the adrenalin is pumping and it's hot,\" said Rafter of his arm afterwards. \"I've just iced it, so you don't know about these things until the morning.\" It was a consummate display which justified the elaborate lengths Tennis Australia went to in laying turf across the hardcourt where the Australian Open final is held. \"I serve and volley. I chip charge. I don't have any secrets in my game,\" Rafter said. \"You just have to play a lot of tough shots to beat me.\" The win was critical for the hosts after Escude had overcome Hewitt 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in 3 hours. That result was a repeat of this year's fourth-round meeting at Wimbledon and the Frenchman, ranked 27 in the world but boasting a cup singles record of seven wins and no defeats, showed he had the measure of Australia's in-form hero. Hewitt had won 22 of his last 24 matches, winning the Masters and topping the Champions Race in the process, and yesterday Escude was never in front until after squaring the match at two sets all. The fifth set's first three games all went against service as the nerves showed, but Escude eventually served out for a gutsy win. \"I used the same tactics today that I used at Wimbledon, to come to the net at every opportunity and put pressure on him,\" said Escude. The volatile world No1 kept his cool all match and was generous in defeat. \"He has been too good both times I've played him on grass this year,\" Hewitt said. \"When I look back on it, I played the way I wanted to but he just served well on the break points.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
