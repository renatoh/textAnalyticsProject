It was his for the duration. He was entitled to it under prime ministerial patronage, key-worker housing and the tied-cottage concept. He claims to have been evicted by the press. That is rubbish. Editors are not bailiffs. Prescott lost his nerve during that euphemism for office self-indulgence called an \"awayday\". These accidents in-waiting are always signs of an underemployed firm. Prescott then made the second mistake of playing croquet. This is not a game at all, but a dark and ruthless human confrontation. Small wonder the deputy prime minister needed two bodyguards present when bending over his mallet. He may have thought, with Wilde, that \"anybody can be good in the country\". But before taking up such a pseudo-genteel pursuit he should have read Auden: \"The croquet matches in summer, the handshake, the cough, the kiss, / There is always a wicked secret, a private reasoning for this.\" The private reasoning is no mystery. Dorneywood is one of a set of houses round London donated in the last century as a snare for naive Labour ministers. They were supposedly for the relaxation of those without \"places\" of their own. Both Chequers (1917) and Dorneywood (1942) were given during the tribulations of war and with socialism looming. Lord Stanhope gave the spectacular Chevening in 1967, obscurely for use by the Prince of Wales, the prime minister or another cabinet minister. Since 1980 this has tended to mean the foreign secretary. The gifts had a mixed reception. Lord Haldane considered Chequers \"a dangerous distraction\" for those \"unaccustomed to the charms of a country house\". Ministers would lose touch with government business and go native. Arthur Lee, Tory donor of Chequers, regarded this as precisely the point. A fine old house was architectural psychotherapy, to subvert whatever revolutionary instincts its occupant might harbour. The trust deed stated: \"It is not possible to foresee or foretell from what classes or conditions of life the future wielders of power will be drawn ... To the revolutionary statesman, the antique and calm tenacity of Chequers and its annals might suggest some saving virtues in the continuity of English history.\" Maurice Hankey put it more succinctly: \"Chequers should have a marvellous effect on these Labour people.\" Sure enough, the first Labour prime minister, Ramsay Macdonald, was soon purring with delight over his Chiltern retreat. In a broadcast from Chequers he eulogised a place where any prime minister would know that \"birds sing, flowers blossom and body and mind may rest\". Macdonald became besotted by Chequers (not least because it came free, while he had to pay living expenses on Downing Street). He stuffed it not with Labour stalwarts, but with rich and aristocratic ladies, and was mortified when eventually he had to vacate it. Dorneywood was given by a tycoon, Sir Courtauld Thomson, in 1943 for a \"prominent member of the government\". The house is hardly a \"mansion\" as described in the press. It is a modest mostly rebuilt Georgian residence outside Burnham in a style termed by Pevsner \"home counties picturesque\". It was meant to allow a lucky minister some Buckinghamshire peace and relaxation away from the bombs falling on the capital. It came to be used by the chancellor of the exchequer or sometimes the home secretary. These houses are not grace-and-favour residences, royal perquisites awarded to old and faithful servants in retirement. Dorneywood goes with a job, not after it. It is key-worker housing, a tied cottage. Like an embassy residence, it forms part of the prime minister's vast patronage. There are far more of these houses than is generally known, embracing not just home-counties retreats but sumptuous flats in the ministerial compound of Admiralty House, a mansion in Carlton Gardens, a safe house in Eaton Terrace and a scatter of defence properties in Knightsbridge and Kensington. All are justified not by the need for relaxation but by that top person's health-and-safety regime, \"national security\". While legislation has granted a measure of tenure to farm workers, the tied cottage is still alive and well in Whitehall. It rendered farmers little better than indentured labourers, locked into landowners' service for fear of losing the roofs over their families' heads. There are no more heart-rending scenes in Victorian novels than those of rural evictions from such cottages, women and children turned out to live in hedges and gutters until they can find poor relief. Rumour has it that Prescott presented Blair with just such a harrowing picture when he was sacked last month as a departmental minister. He and Pauline would have nowhere to go, he cried, to escape the horrors of the press. Blair could not be so heartless as to the Highland clearances to Burnham Beeches. Prescott loved Dorneywood and could surely keep it under the terms of the bequest as deputy prime minister. Where else could he entertain the entourage of aides and bodyguards so vital to his cabinet committee chairmanships? Blair could surely not force the Prescotts to spend their weekends homeless on the steps of High Wycombe social services. Had cool Britannia come to this? Ministerial houses are like company cars are to lesser mortals, with a status out of all proportion to their monetary worth. When Lord Howe was sacked from the Foreign Office and made deputy prime minister, he was heartbroken to give up his beloved Chevening. In politics, \"la maison, c'est moi\". Even Stalin allowed his fallen underlings to keep their Moscow dachas (until he shot them). As a result, letting Prescott keep his house after sacking him was a kindly gesture on Blair's part. After all, Dorneywood was intended for ministers wanting to escape from the blitz. What difference if the falling bombs are real or from a media blitz? To Blair, Dorneywood was key-worker housing. He needed a deputy prime minister near him, and you cannot find good ones these days for love nor money, not even from Poland. In contrast there is no shortage of chancellors, and home secretaries are falling out of trees. Perhaps Prescott should have held on by applying his own housing policy. He has been obsessional about meeting the \"need\" for more rural housing in the south-east, irrespective of price or income, and particularly for essential workers. A shortcoming of the keyworker policy is always the difficulty of evicting tenants once installed - even if they leave their \"essential\" jobs. Prescott should have served notice on the prime minister of his right to buy. He could have declared Dorneywood garden a brownfield site, built one of his multi-storey blocks of flats on it and registered as a social landlord of affordable housing, as needed by himself and Pauline. He could have dismissed all opposition as nimbyist. At the very least Prescott could have installed a Leylandii hedge, claiming that protection from Daily Mail photographers was a matter of national security. Instead he chucked in the towel. To keep his job he offered up his second home as what he allegedly called a \"slice of salami\" to the press. Dorneywood? Salami?
