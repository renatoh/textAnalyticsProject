In a time of three minutes and \u2026 \u201d Bannister had achieved what many thought was impossible by smashing the four-minute-mile barrier. Now, Eliud Kipchoge, four times a London marathon winner, the last of them only days ago, has announced his intention to shatter athletics\u2019 last great barrier \u2013 running a marathon in under two hours. \u201cThis will surpass everything I have achieved,\u201d says Kipchoge, 34, who intends to make the attempt in London in October. \u201cIt will be history for the human family.\u201d One idea under consideration is to hold it in Battersea Park in front of a 250,000 crowd. As things stand, the Guardian understands that preferred date is 13 October , a week after the World Championships end. Organisers also confirmed that Hugh Brasher, the son of Chris Brasher, who helped pace Bannister in 1954, is helping with their planning as part of his role as the event director of the London marathon. The attempt is bound to generate controversy, however, given it is financed by the richest man in Britain, Jim Ratcliffe, whose petrochemical company Ineos has faced protests from environmentalists for its business practices, use of plastics and links to fracking. However Ratcliffe, who recently took over the Team Sky cycling squad and is funding the Daily Mile in schools, denied he is engaging in sportswashing. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really good sporting endeavour,\u201d he said. \u201cFor athletics or endurance, this is the most extraordinary challenge that faces a human being. For any of us who do run, the concept of going for 42km at 2min 50sec a kilometre is unthinkable. Most people on the planet couldn\u2019t do that for one kilometre, so achieving this would be almost superhuman.\u201d When asked whether he really believes it is feasible, Ratcliffe nodded. \u201cI watched Eliud from the London Marathon pace car last Sunday,\u201d he said. \u201cThe roads were poor. It was a really hilly course. It was windy. And it didn\u2019t really have pacemakers who were effective as they weren\u2019t going fast enough. And he still ran two hours two minutes.\u201d If anyone can run a marathon in 1hr 59m it is surely Kipchoge, who is the reigning Olympic champion and holds the world record of 2:01:39. Two years ago at the Monza racetrack the Kenyan also became the fastest man over 26.2 miles, running 2:00:25, although it did not count as an official record as it did not comply with all the rules of athletics\u2019 governing body, the IAAF. Kipchoge confirmed that similar banned strategies, including using a pace car that acts as a giant wind-shield and having a phalanx of pacemakers who subbed in and out of the race, would be used in October. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the IAAF, it\u2019s about history,\u201d he explained. \u201cI really want to leave a big legacy.\u201d Organisers are hoping that the attempt will take place on a two-three kilometre circuit in London, either in a park or on closed roads. But they admit they will need the authorities to be flexible on dates as they need a two-week window in October to enable them to run on a day when it is around 12C, dry and with little wind. Whether the British weather will be so obliging, however, is another story. \u201cWe just hope the powers that be in London are sympathetic to the quest,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cIf it\u2019s a road circuit it needs to be a Sunday morning and we need to have optionality on three consecutive weekends. If there\u2019s too much rain, for instance, there\u2019s not enough adhesion and you\u2019re slipping around the corners. \u201cThe course also has to be flat, a good surface, and it can\u2019t have corners which are too sharp,\u201d he added. \u201cSecondly, we have to find pacers to keep up. Then, it is about having the right environment and a crowd to lift Eliud\u2019s spirits, as in Monza it got a bit lonely. A lot of this is about pain tolerance. What level of pain are you prepared to tolerate?\u201d The Kenyan, meanwhile, is convinced he has the experience and nous to succeed. \u201cRunning the fastest ever marathon time of 2:00:25 was the proudest moment of my career,\u201d said Kipchoge, who was speaking at the Iffley Road track where Bannister broke the four-minute mark. \u201cTo get another chance to break the magical two-hour mark is incredibly exciting. I always say that no human is limited, and I know that it is possible.\u201d Ratcliffe, moreover, insists he is unconcerned about the prospect of large protests during the record attempt \u2013 and insisted that his latest project is not about trying to soften his company\u2019s image. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get too deep about it really,\u201d he claimed. \u201cWe make US$6bn-7bn a year in profit. What\u2019s wrong with investing a bit of that into sport, good challenges and some good people? Eliud is the best marathon runner there has ever been. This will be very inspirational \u2013 and get kids putting running shoes on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
