Maybe it's the glasses, the hot talk about black holes or the Asperger's-like obsession with sci-fi, science or gadgets,\" says Wired's Underwired blog. To prove it, or not, it has launched its fourth annual Wired.com Sexiest Geeks contest. You can submit photos of your favourites and vote contestants up or down. Even a cursory glance shows there's an advantage to showing a lot of cleavage, so don't place your bets on Stephen Colbert, Shigeru Miyamoto or Richard Stallman. I notice Steve Jobs has 31 up votes and 92 down votes, at the moment. Surely the Apple Faithful are not going to sit around while that happens, are they? Note: several sexy geeks -- Veronica Belmont etc -- appear multiple times, perhaps because people can't be bothered to go through multiple pages: it's incredibly clunky. But if you can be bothered, remember to vote for Foxconn's most famous factory worker iPhone Girl!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
