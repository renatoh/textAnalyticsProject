As retail companies braced themselves for lacklustre business on the high street, their shares suffered on the stock market. GUS was down 1.5% and Marks &amp; Spencer was down 0.1%. The number of shoppers visiting malls and other retail outlets fell by 7.2% during the week beginning December 16, according to market analyst Footfall. So far, the pre-Christmas week was the worst in three years, Footfall said. Still retailers are banking on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve to boost sales and a survey gives them some hope. According to Egg, the financial services group, one in four people will be dashing to buy presents today. Shops in Wales and the west of England will be among the busiest on Christmas Eve, according to the poll, with 32% of those questioned planning a final spending spree. The most organised shoppers in the country live in the north west where 81% expect to have got all their presents in advance. The survey of 1,000 people predicted that shoppers will spend around \u00a34.3bn today - or \u00a3120,000 a second. Jerry Toher, managing director of Egg UK, said: \"Over \u00a320bn will be spent on debit and credit cards this December, which suggests that while people are happy to brave the crowds and queues in the shops, they are not willing to waste time by queuing at cash machines.\" Notwithstanding any final splurge, indications are that consumers are becoming more cautious amid growing concerns about a housing crash and possible war in Iraq. The consumer confidence barometer of research, conducted by Martin Hamblin GfK, tumbled to -4 in December, the lowest figure since October 2001, from +2 in November. GfK blamed increasing speculation about a crash in house prices and a war in Iraq for the loss of confidence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
