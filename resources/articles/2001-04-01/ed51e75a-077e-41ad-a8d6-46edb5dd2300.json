If Grimsby Town stay up this season, as they should, they will owe their goalkeeper a huge debt of gratitude - and, if Blackburn Rovers secure automatic promotion, as they should, they might be tempted to add a word of thanks of their own. The unfortunate Coyne, comfortably the Mariners' player of the year, gifted Rovers a crucial opening goal in a match in which up to that point they had looked second best. \"For the first half-hour they were the better team,\" acknowledged the Rovers manager Graeme Souness. \"That bit of luck got us on our way.\" Thereafter it was relatively plain sailing for Souness's expensively assembled outfit, now four points clear of Bolton Wanderers in third. With only three games to play and a superior goal difference, they should not falter now. A first-minute shot by Alan Pouton was evidence that Grimsby intended to stretch their visitors. It took a good block by Rovers' goalkeeper Brad Friedel to stop Steve Livingstone putting the home team ahead after 15 minutes and the American was called on again shortly afterwards, scrambling Tony Gallimore's free-kick unconvincingly round a post. When Paul Groves put a clean header from a corner into his arms Friedel let his defence know what he thought of them but Grimsby, for all their verve and intent, still had not scored and gradually Blackburn were playing their way into the game. Henning Berg shot high, Craig Hignett low and straight at Coyne but David Dunn was already turning away when his less than powerful curling effort from the edge of the area squirmed through Coyne's arms and into the net. It was a present Blackburn barely deserved and it changed the match. Minutes later the Grimsby defence was apparently still stunned when Damien Johnson crossed from the right and Eyal Berkovic rose unmarked to head in. With Grimsby forced to press forward in even greater numbers, Blackburn began to enjoy themselves, passing the ball around on a difficult pitch with an aplomb that bodes well for next season. Coyne saved well from Berkovic and did even better when Mark Hughes drove in a close-range shot but the writing was on the wall and cruelly underlined on the hour when Matt Jansen outpaced the defence and slipped the ball past Coyne. That should have been that but almost immediately Rovers dozily allowed Luke Cornwall, a pacy young striker on loan from Fulham, to poke the ball past Friedel from close range. It set up a distinctly awkward final quarter for Rovers, and it took a break from Marcus Bent and a lovely square pass to Jansen to underline the gulf in class. \"It was a harsh scoreline,\" said Lennie Lawrence. \"Poor Danny's won us at least half a dozen points on his own this season and if the first hadn't gone in the second wouldn't have done either.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
