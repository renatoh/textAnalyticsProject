When Philippe Coutinho \u2013 or Phil, as his new manager calls him \u2013 equalised for Liverpool on the stroke of half-time, Klopp turned to his substitutes and gave Ibe such a hearty high five that you almost expected him to produce a foaming jug of beer from behind his back. When he later admonished Ibe for not being stripped and ready to come on in the second half, moments later Klopp was cajoling the young winger and bromancing him into the state of mind that led to him playing a key part in Liverpool\u2019s third goal. And when the final whistle blew and Klopp strode on to the pitch to celebrate his first victory in the Premier League, he reserved a special hug for Ibe, whose pass inside from the right in the 83rd minute was cleverly dummied by Adam Lallana and left for Christian Benteke to finish off Chelsea with a low finish past Asmir Begovic. It is easy to see why players bounce off Klopp and indeed it was tempting to wonder if Chelsea\u2019s despondent players were casting the occasional envious glance at the German, whose energetic and engrossing touchline demeanour offered a welcome shade of light next to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s dark scowl. Chelsea are 15th because their defence is porous, their midfield is stodgy and their attack is struggling to create chances. Eden Hazard, last season\u2019s player of the year, was peripheral, and substituted in the 59th minute. The champions took the lead thanks to Ramires\u2019s header but their early intensity faded and Liverpool, who looked terrified in the opening 20 minutes, gradually asserted themselves. It would be disingenuous to say that Klopp accepted all of Mark Clattenburg\u2019s decisions with magnanimity. One boggle-eyed charge towards the fourth official, Lee Mason, left Mourinho justifiably asking what would have happened if he had done something similar. Yet Klopp still managed to be a breath of fresh air, a ball of pent-up fury when Liverpool were wayward in the early exchanges, a beaming, tracksuited, slightly messy creator of happiness and fun when they romped away with the points thanks to late goals from Coutinho and Benteke. While Liverpool were far from perfect, undoubtedly benefiting from a slice of luck when Lucas Leiva did not receive a second booking for fouling Ramires, there were the obvious signs of a plan, of a team that is slowly going in the right direction and adapting to Klopp\u2019s demands. Klopp slapped his head a few times when Roberto Firmino, who played at the tip of Liverpool\u2019s attack before Benteke came on to give them a more robust focal point, wasted a promising move with an overly ambitious shot from long range. Liverpool lacked conviction at times, not to mention the ability to play the correct final pass. Yet when they clicked, the effect was glorious, Coutinho bending in two sumptuous efforts, one with his left foot and one with his right, before Benteke wrapped up the win. This was the first time Liverpool have fought back from a goal down to win since the victory over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup in February. \u201cCool, hey!\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe have to see what it does. I don\u2019t know.\u201d He is not getting carried away. Liverpool must travel to Russia to face Rubin Kazan in the Europa League on Thursday and then rouse themselves for the visit of Palace on Sunday. Klopp does not possess an outstanding squad but he has enough raw materials to work with for now. \u201cPhil is a brilliant player and we don\u2019t have to talk about his qualities,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cSometimes you have to work really hard to make football look easy. That is what he did. It was not a perfect start for Phil. But he came back and he was cool enough in the right moment, to shoot at the right moment. \u201cThat is his quality of course. But not always is the sun shining. We have to work hard on days when it is raining for the team. Everyone asks me every day if I have seen the next step. When you come in and bring new ideas, new information, everything \u2026 My experience is that quality goes down a little bit.\u201d Klopp pointed to his chest. \u201cYou try to play from here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you lose your coolness, your flexibility and your fun for the game. You have to take the new information and develop.\u201d He needs time as he seeks to thrust Liverpool back into the elite and Klopp was exasperated when he was asked about finishing in the top four. They are only four points behind Manchester United. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that England is so impatient!\u201d He spotted Clattenburg walking past at that very moment. \u201cThey are asking me about the top four,\u201d Klopp said to the referee. \u201cWelcome to England,\u201d Clattenburg replied. Like Clattenburg, Klopp knows that Liverpool are not the finished article. \u201cI have been here three weeks,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI don\u2019t read newspapers but everyone tells me: \u2018You want to buy this player, this player, this player\u2019. But development is to work with the players you have. It\u2019s like if you have a problem with your wife, you don\u2019t want to change every day!\u201d That was followed by the loudest laugh that has echoed around Stamford Bridge for a long time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
