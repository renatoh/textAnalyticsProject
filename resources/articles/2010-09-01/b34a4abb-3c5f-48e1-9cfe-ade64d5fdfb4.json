On the same day, your front page caricatures his decision to undertake unpaid work promoting education and access to IT in poor countries as an \"attempt to rebrand himself\" as \"Saint Gordon\". What's the matter with you people? Can't you give credit where it is most certainly due without taking what Sister Gillian Price would call the p***s? Do you have zero emotional intelligence? Neil Kinnock London \u2022\u2008Funny that Morrissey describes Chinese people as a \"subspecies\" (Report, 4 September). Sounds like tit for tat a few centuries late. Way back, when the Han Chinese first encountered white Europeans, they called them \"[creatures with] red beards and green eyes\". All Han Chinese have uniform black hair and brown eyes, and according to their observations only animals had different hair and eye colours. Thus the only conclusion they could draw at the time was that the white Europeans must be \"subhuman\". Dr Suet Ying Ho Visiting fellow, Centre for East Asian Studies, University of Bristol \u2022\u2008\"Contrary to what you might read in some newspapers, falling [UK] house prices would be a blessing\" (Editorial, 3 September). \"Before [the] midterms, the [US] president must bring in big measures to \u2026 stop the freefall in the housing market\" (Editorial, 4 September). Discuss. Peter Fiddick Kew, Surrey \u2022\u2008It is good that the Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali opposes extremist ideologies based on religion (Face to faith, 4 September). Why then, does he follow the extremist ideology of opposing the ordination of gay people to the episcopate? Canon David Jennings Burbage, Leicestershire \u2022\u2008I worry that UK media give more attention to three Pakistani cricketers (Report, 4 September) than to the millions of their compatriots displaced from their homes as a result of catastrophic flooding.
