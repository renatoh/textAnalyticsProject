Guardiola suggested Man\u00e9 is \u201csometimes diving\u201d after the player was booked for simulation in Liverpool\u2019s last-ditch victory at Aston Villa on Saturday. This followed the forward having secured a penalty in the fourth minute of added time against Leicester and late on against Tottenham. The score was 1-1 in each match and Liverpool went on to win on both occasions. J\u00fcrgen Klopp had forcibly disagreed with Guardiola\u2019s view and he has been forced into a climbdown. \u201cIn the 94th minute it was against Leicester, it was a penalty and it was wow,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThat was the intention for my comment. Far away from my intention to say Sadio is this type of player because I admire him a lot. \u201cFor J\u00fcrgen it is a penalty, for the referee it was a penalty, for VAR it was a penalty, so I was the wrong guy,\u201d he added. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen said he knows Sadio better than me. And I have an incredible respect and the message in the football always try to be like this, always positive and attractive. My son and my daughter, when they win in the last minutes, they ask me how lucky they are. I say it\u2019s not lucky. \u201cWhat Liverpool have done last season and this season many times is because they have this incredible quality and this incredible talent to fight until the end. Hopefully I can clarify everything for J\u00fcrgen. \u201cThat\u2019s why I said to my players, not just my son and my daughter, that it is not lucky. It happens once or twice in a life then yes [it is], but this happens maybe 10 or 12 or 13 times.\u201d Klopp also suggested Guardiola is fixated with Liverpool. \u201cI didn\u2019t listen to what he said, so I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. Guardiola attempted to close down Klopp\u2019s claim regarding City and tactical fouls, a view also held by Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, his predecessor as the Manchester United manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, and the West Ham manager, Manuel Pellegrini. \u201cNo comment on that. I don\u2019t put oil in the fire,\u201d he said. If City beat Atalanta at San Siro on Wednesday they are guaranteed passage to the Champions League knockout stages. \u201cI\u2019m wanting to qualify as soon as possible,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking of rotating my squad. I go game by game, try to win tomorrow, then we are already there for one more year. \u201cBut if not we have Shakhtar Donetsk and Dinamo Zagreb still to play and we will see then. Wednesday is the most important to try to win and after go on to the next one.\u201d John Stones is in line to make a first start in the competition, his season having been hampered by injury. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult getting injured,\u201d the centre-back said. It was difficult not being able to be there for the team and manager, trying to stay as fit and healthy as I can, trying to get a run of games when called on. \u201cNow I feel good, feel fit and that\u2019s the main thing. I need to stay like this for the rest of the season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
