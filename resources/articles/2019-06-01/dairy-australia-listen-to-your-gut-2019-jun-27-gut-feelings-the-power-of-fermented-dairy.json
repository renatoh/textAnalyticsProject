Foods such as yoghurt, cheese and kefir, made by fermenting milk with bacterial starter culture, have long been a staple of healthy diets. Yoghurt has been traced back to Bulgaria and Central Asia, where nomads may have carried milk in animal skins, inadvertently discovering the process of fermentation as well as a powerful form of food preservation. Kefir, a tart fermented drink derived from the Turkish word for joy and pleasure, was conceived in the Caucasus Mountains as far back as 10,000BC. It\u2019s since been consumed everywhere from Russia to the Middle East, lauded for its ability to regulate digestion and boost flagging immune systems. And in Norway and Sweden, people have been enjoying filmj\u00f6lk, a sour fermented milk with a thick consistency, since the ninth century. The origins of fermented dairy products are as diverse as the cultures in which they were sparked. In many ways, fermented dairy is the original health elixir, predating milk alternatives such as almond milk, and wellness fads such as coconut water. Fermented dairy can be rich in probiotics: live bacteria that nourish your gut microbiome, made up of trillions of microorganisms that live in your intestinal tract and govern everything from how well you digest the food you eat, to the way your body absorbs nutrients. A 2017, a study from The Nutrition Society found the health benefits of fermented milk drinks such as kefir included improved digestion, anti-inflammatory effects and the stimulation of antioxidants, which can aid disease prevention. Yoghurt - which can contain probiotics such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus - may spur changes in colonic bacteria that can lower the risk of irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn\u2019s disease and type-2 diabetes. In many ways, fermented dairy is the original health elixir, predating milk alternatives such as almond milk, and wellness fads such as coconut water. Nicole Dynan, a dietitian with expertise in gut health, says the consumption of fermented dairy can add good bacteria to your gut microbiome. The living microorganisms present in fermented dairy can also lead to the production of healthy short chain fatty acids inside the colon. \u201cConsuming fermented dairy can [help] the digestive system because it actually adds more beneficial bacteria to the system,\u201d Dynan says. \u201cIf we put it in simple terms, most of our bacteria live in the large intestine and [fermented dairy] can assist that existing population of bacteria to balance out the good and bad. Fermented dairy can contain microbiota that make by-products called short-chain fatty acids that can help release anti-inflammatory benefits into the body.\u201d \u201cFermented dairy can also represent a precious source of other nutrients and vitamins such as C and E, while balancing out the \u2018bad\u2019 bacteria that can lead to common digestive problems such as bloating, diarrhoea, pain and gas,\u201d she says. But Dynan warns that not all yoghurt or kefirs are the same. \u201cSome people think that they just have to take a probiotic and they\u2019ll have good gut health or that all fermented food contains probiotics,\u201d she says. \u201cIt should specifically say on the packaging that [the product] contains live microbes. Often, the products on a shelf in a supermarket have been sterilised.\u201d \u201cConsuming fermented dairy can [help] the digestive system because it actually adds more beneficial bacteria to the system,\u201d Dynan says. For Dynan, the biggest misconceptions about dairy consumption revolve around the belief that dairy alternatives are nutritionally superior to milk and that lactose creates digestive problems. According to a 2019 survey by the Australian Doctor Group, perceived lactose intolerance and fear of gastrointestinal disorders are among the top fears shared by patients concerned about dairy. But fermented dairy can help ease some forms of insensitivity. A 2003 study by Steven Hertzler found that kefir and yoghurt improved lactose digestion and intolerance by 54-71% compared with milk. \u201cOne of the benefits of dairy milk is that it is high in protein,\u201d Dynan says. \u201cSome of the dairy alternatives are not necessarily better for you. They are like flavoured water and some of them have added sugars as well. \u201cMilk has the highest amount of lactose but not all dairy products contain lactose. Fermented dairy is particularly good because it helps the gut break lactose down. Generally speaking, most people could tolerate anywhere from about 4 to 12 grams of lactose per serve. The great thing about consuming small amounts of dairy is that you keep lactase, the enzyme that digests lactose, in your system.\u201d Dynan says it\u2019s worth remembering that the diversity of the microbiota in our gut is as individual as a fingerprint. It\u2019s important to take measures to feed the good microbiota and keep the balance of microorganisms in our bodies in check. \u201cIf we\u2019re eating a lot of junk or processed food, that actually feeds the bad bacteria, which can lead to inflammation and chronic disease,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at the Mediterranean diet, considered the healthiest diet in the world, includes fermented dairy. It contains cheese and yoghurt, with smaller amounts of other fermented dairy. I think fermented foods are pretty critical for most people,\u201d she says.
