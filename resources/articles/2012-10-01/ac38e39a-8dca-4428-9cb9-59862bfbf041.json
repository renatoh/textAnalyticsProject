Celebrating and drawing on the lives of Salford's multicultural population, and exploring communication, the show takes the form of a series of absurd encounters aiming to highlight what happens when language fails us but we still need to find ways to talk to each other. The show is produced in association with the Lowry and Walk The Plank, and director Mel Cook has worked with both Coney and Hide&amp;Seek as well as creating work for the Shunt Vaults, so he's well-versed in creating immersive theatre in a distinct setting. Book via The Lowry, Sat to 28 Oct Lyn Gardner The White House Murder Case, London In the run-up to the US election, the Orange Tree stages a dark American satirical thriller on politics, war and spin that was written in 1970 but set 40 years in the future (ie now). The author of The White House Murder Case was cartoonist, playwright and novelist Jules Feiffer, winner of an Oscar and the Pulitzer prize. His play deals with a nerve gas that's released by mistake, killing 750 soldiers. The most pressing question quickly becomes how to spin this to the voting public ahead of the poll when the country is at war and the president's wife is a goddamn peacenik; it's complicated further when a murder is committed. The production is directed by Christopher Morahan (best known for TV's The Jewel In The Crown), who also tackled Feiffer's play Little Murders for the RSC in 1967. Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, Wed to 10 Nov Mark Cook American Idiot, Southampton Green Day singer-guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong may have recently checked into rehab after an onstage strop but it won't make much difference here: the band were never slated to appear in this adaptation of their 2004 concept album which took its inspiration from the Who's Tommy and Jesus Christ Superstar. Heading off on a seven-week tour across the UK and Ireland, the show repackages the American punk band's songs and lyrics into the tale of three young men trying to discover themselves and the meaning of life. The musical has had a cult following in the US, although its success on Broadway was limited, despite a Tony nomination for Best Original Musical. The Mayflower, Tue to 13 Oct, then touring LG Elegy, London As Human Rights Watch publishes its annual report, a play inspired by interviews carried out by the organisation opens. Elegy is devised and directed by Douglas Rintoul and is based on the testimony of gay Iraqi refugees fleeing to Syria to escape homophobic persecution in their home country. Actor Jamie Bradley tells the story of a refugee crossing the no man's land of empty train stations and bomb-blasted towns; a man wanted neither by his own country or anyone else's. It's a compassionate study of a person enduring brutality, fear and exploitation, performed on a bed of more than 700 items of discarded men's clothes, representing the amount of homophobic murders by militia groups (plus family-perpetrated \"honour\" killings) in \"liberated\" Iraq. Theatre 503, SW11, Tue to 3 Nov MC Lighthearted Intercourse, Bolton Bolton's Bill Naughton was a great chronicler of everyday life and had huge success with plays including Spring And Port Wine and Alfie. Naughton's Annie And Fanny was the play that opened the Octagon in 1967 and now the Bolton theatre's artistic director David Thacker has been entrusted by Naughton's widow, Erna, with crafting a new play from the drafts and notes for a piece that the playwright was working on before he died. Set in Bolton in the 1920s, Lighthearted Intercourse is the tale of a young married couple with a small baby, living at a time of economic hardship, and both with secrets that they'd rather not share. Then, the arrival of a stranger changes their lives \u2026 The Octagon Theatre, to 3 Nov LG A Tender Thing, Stratford-upon-Avon Romeo And Juliet gets a makeover in Ben Power's rewrite which imagines what might have happened to the lovers had they escaped death. Would their passionate young love have deepened into something more mature? How would they have coped as old age, death and separation approached? Creating a brand-new play but using only Shakespeare's words \u2013 taken from Romeo And Juliet and sources including the sonnets \u2013 Power creates a meditative two-hander on love and memory. During its first run in 2009, Kathryn Hunter received great praise for her role as the dying Juliet; she repeats the part here under the direction of Helena Kaut-Howson. Royal Shakespeare Theatre: The Swan, Sat to 20 Oct LG Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet: Mixed Bill, London US dance has fewer repertory companies than the UK, so much of Cedar Lake's chosen work is more well known here than in its home city of New York. This UK debut brings together an interesting trio of pieces by anyone's standards: Hofesh Shechter's Violet Kid is a study of youthful angst; Alexander Ekman's Tuplet sees him on engaging form; while the London premiere of Crystal Pite's Grace Engine rounds off an ambitious bill. Sadler's Wells, EC1, Thu to 13 Oct Judith Mackrell The Royal Ballet: Swan Lake, London It's the start of the Royal's new season \u2013 the company's first under director Kevin O'Hare \u2013 and for its opening production it's playing box-office safe with a run of Swan Lake. This 1987 production, revived in 2000, is looking a tad ratty now, its gothic fussiness more than dated, though some stellar casting should bring it to life. Natalia Osipova makes her UK debut after exiting Bolshoi last year. Just as she created a fascinatingly individual interpretation of Giselle, her Odette/Odile promises to be no less distinctive, and she's partnered by Carlos Acosta. Aside from the big-name stars, look out for promising ballerina Akane Takada. Royal Opera House, WC2, Mon to 24 Nov JM"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
