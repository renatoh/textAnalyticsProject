Trevor Noah: \u2018He looks like Dobby got a job at KPMG\u2019 On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah introduced a section where he explained exactly who Johnson is to a US audience firstly by comparing him to the president. \u201cLook at them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey look like they were separated at birth, and I mean purposely.\u201d He explained that Johnson could be the next prime minister, a job that\u2019s now become \u201cabout as desirable as being Kanye West\u2019s social media manager\u201d before comparing him to a \u201cstunt double for Jeff Daniels in Dumb and Dumber\u201d. He then played footage of Johnson getting stuck on a zipline. \u201cI guess at the same time though it\u2019s probably good preparation for handling Brexit,\u201d he said. Noah recounted a selection of Johnson\u2019s most offensive statements and ended with him referring to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, as a Dobby lookalike, which he did say was accurate. \u201cHe looks like Dobby got a job at KPMG,\u201d he joked. Noah continued: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty ballsy for Boris to make fun of someone for looking like a Harry Potter character when he looks like a midlife crisis Malfoy.\u201d While the Daily Show host remains unsure of Johnson\u2019s suitability as a leader, he is sure of one thing. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019d be a good prime minister but I do know that he definitely deserves his own sitcom,\u201d Noah said. Stephen Colbert: \u2018That\u2019s what\u2019s horrible about war: the commute\u2019 On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about Trump\u2019s time in Britain. \u201cThroughout the trip, Trump has insisted that instead of protests, the people of London have been cheering. And today he was right, because he left,\u201d he said. Trump travelled from London to Dublin, where he said he knew most Irish Americans, with Colbert joking about some of his closest friends: the Lucky Charms leprechaun, Liam Neeson, Filet-O-Fish, etc. He also spoke about Trump\u2019s interview with \u201cchatshow chumbucket\u201d Piers Morgan, who started by telling him how well-behaved he was around the royal family. \u201cWe\u2019re complimenting the president like he\u2019s a dog?\u201d Colbert asked. Trump then said that the Queen walked at the same pace as he did, which Colbert said was either \u201can odd compliment or a strange confession\u201d. Trump went on to say that tornadoes have always been a problem and that 40 years ago there was a real binge of them. \u201cWho hasn\u2019t gone out for a tornado and had a few too many?\u201d Colbert joked. Morgan asked Trump if he regrets not being able to serve during the Vietnam war, and Trump said he didn\u2019t agree with it and it was so far away. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s horrible about war: the commute,\u201d Colbert said. Jimmy Kimmel: \u2018He thought the D stood for Donald\u2019 On Jimmy Kimmel Live, the host spoke about Trump\u2019s attendance at the D-day commemoration. \u201cHe initially agreed to attend because he thought the D stood for Donald,\u201d he joked. Kimmel continued: \u201cThe only beach Donald Trump would storm is spring break in Daytona.\u201d He also spoke about Trump\u2019s thought on the climate crisis and how reportedly Prince Charles spent time trying to convince him of the severity. \u201cIf Prince Charles was smart he would have talked exclusively about the impact climate change would have on the fried chicken industry,\u201d he joked."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
