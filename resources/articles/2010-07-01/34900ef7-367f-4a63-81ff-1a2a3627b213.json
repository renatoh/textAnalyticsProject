While more recent conflicts have attracted landmine clearance and victim assistance funding, the western desert and the Bedouin, who continue to pasture herds, have been largely ignored. The extended battlefield of El Alamein has, between Libya and Alexandria, an estimated 16.7 million explosive remnants of war. While the Egyptian state has been tardy in ratifying the mine ban treaty and ambiguous as to whether it continues to produce, sell or stockpile anti-personnel mines, nonetheless the 500,000 inhabitants of the western desert are every bit as entitled to their share of protection from the effects of unexploded ordnance as are communities affected by later conflicts. The prioritising of our sympathy according to who has the greater number of landmines has somehow managed to allow the western desert to slip through the net, even though it is a strong contender for the top three landmine-infested areas in the world. Clearance is expensive, but elsewhere, for example Pakistan, we are close on the heels of battle: prevention of injury to civilians is effected through mine risk education, to instil safe patterns of behaviour when returning to homes and land; and local paramedic services, with rehabilitation for traumatic amputees. Resources and the interest of major donors is sadly lacking in the western desert. Europe's war wounds have been largely healed and the allies have moved on to levels of security and affluence probably few in the 1940s could have imagined. Yet, to our great shame, the shepherds over whose heads Europe's mightiest conflict was fought continue to pick their precarious way through a remorseless garden of loss.
