Greek prosecutors formally charged the pair yesterday after a three-month investigation, along with their former coach and doctors who treated them after the mystery motorcycle crash on the eve of the opening ceremony of the games, where Kederis was due to light the Olympic flame. Kederis, the 2000 Olympic 200 metres champion, and Thanou, the Sydney 100m bronze medallist, are also to be suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations next week when its doping review panel meets in Monaco. It will almost certainly launch a formal investigation into a series of alleged missed drugs tests, which could lead to a two-year suspension for the two runners. The prosecutors Spyros Mouzakitis and Athina Theodoropoulou allege Kederis and Thanou had repeatedly obstructed doping officials after they failed to appear at scheduled tests in Chicago and Tel Aviv shortly before the games, and then again at the Olympic Village in Athens on August 12. The athletes' former coach Christos Tzekos was charged with obstructing tests and owning, storing and trading banned substances found at his nutrition supplements company. A witness to the midnight crash, in which Kederis said he was driving with Thanou as his passenger as they returned to the Olympic village to take drug tests, has been charged with perjury. Kederis and Thanou stayed in an Athens hospital for four days after the crash, claiming they were too ill to help Olympic officials with their inquiries. The injuries were officially blamed for their subsequent decision to scratch from their events. The pair are also involved in the FBI investigation in the United States into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative after it was alleged it had supplied them with the designer anabolic steroid THG (tetrahydrogestrinone). Kederis, 31, and Thanou, 29, have always denied taking banned drugs, deliberately evading a dope test or faking the motorcycle crash. \"I had never been notified of the test and suddenly people were saying I could be thrown out of the games,\" Kederis said last month in his only interview since the Olympics. \"The accident did occur.\" It is likely to be at least a year before the case comes to court. That will put pressure on the IAAF to act quickly to prevent Kederis or Thanou competing at next year's world championships in Helsinki in August. Since the Olympics, Kederis has sacked Tzekos and is now being trained by one of his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, Yorgas Panayiotopoulos. Panayiotopoulos also works with Fani Halkia, who rose from anonymity to win the Olympic 400m hurdles title in Athens. Kederis also won the world gold medal in Edmonton in 2001 but failed to defend his title in Paris last year because of injury, although there were persistent rumours at the time he had tested positive for a banned drug. These reports proved to be wrong. \"The IAAF investigation is totally independent of the Greek authorities and we don't have to wait for a conclusion to their proceedings,\" said Nick Davies, the spokesman for the international body. \"The important thing is that the IAAF get the chance to study all the evidence.\" Even if they are found guilty by the Greek legal system, it is unlikely Kederis or Thanou will be sent to jail. They will probably instead face a fine or a suspended prison sentence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
