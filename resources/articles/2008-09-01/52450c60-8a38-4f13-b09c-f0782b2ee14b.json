As it grows - at a rate of about a centimetre a month - it locks in information about your diet, environment and lifestyle. At Bradford university, archaeologist Andrew Wilson is using these \"biochemical signatures\" to find out what our ancestors ate and what sent them to the great barber's in the sky, while at Glamorgan, forensic scientist Richard Paul is getting disturbing insights into the living's drinking habits. They tell Quentin Cooper all about it in The Material World (4.30pm, Radio 4).
