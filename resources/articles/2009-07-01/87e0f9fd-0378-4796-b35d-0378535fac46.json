More than 160 cases of serious fraud costing \u00a3636m made the first six months of the year the highest fraud rate in the 21-year history of the consultants' report. Hitesh Patel, partner at KPMG Forensic, said: \"These figures are bad, but the worst is yet to come. Hard times mean more people driven to fraud by personal pressures, and more investors willing to believe in cooked up investment schemes. Companies too remain vulnerable to the threat within \u2013 their staff.\" Professional gangs were the most active perpetrators of fraud, with 70 cases worth \u00a3450m, and their main victims were investors, who suffered to the tune of \u00a3320m. Company managers were responsible for \u00a3150m of fraud against their own employers in 32 cases. The government suffered \u00a3150m of fraud, mostly in the form of tax and duty evasion and fraudulent benefit claims. The highest number of cases were in the financial sector, with a value of \u00a3111m. Property was also at the heart of much fraud. A large buy-to-let fraud in the north-east conned as many as 2,000 investors out of \u00a380m. investing in properties which often turned out to be little more than derelict shells. Mortgage fraud \u2013 either by individual customers or organised professionals - also continued its gradual but steady rise in the courts. There were 18 cases with a combined value of \u00a324m in the first half of the year, compared to 25 cases worth \u00a336m in the whole of 2008. KPMG's Fraud Barometer measures cases with charges in excess of \u00a3100,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
