The Liverpool captain was not on the scoresheet against West Bromwich Albion but he completed his third game in a week, confounding those who thought his 34-year-old legs might be in need of more rest this season. Gerrard said after his goal in the Merseyside derby last week it was nice to prove a point to people who had been prematurely writing him off, though that goal was from a set piece. He has been playing in a more withdrawn role as a defensive midfielder yet Brendan Rodgers believes he can still contribute in a more forward role if necessary, and could even be the key to producing the best from Mario Balotelli. The Liverpool manager encouraged his captain to do just that towards the end of the 2-1 victory at Anfield, and even suggested he might get a start in an attacking role before long. \u201cIf I thought it would help the team I could do that,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cYou could see his quality and his ability to combine with Balotelli straight away. Steven is a player who makes the game look simple and Mario knows he is playing with one of the greats of the game. Mario is a guy who needs certain type of passes and Steven is the sort of player who can provide them. \u201cHe definitely added something to our game in that position, though I feel he has been outstanding in the deeper position too. It was refreshing to see the cleverness and brightness he brought, and that was his third tough game in a week.\u201d There were two other members of the Gerrard fan club present on Merseyside on Saturday, his former manager G\u00e9rard Houllier and the West Bromwich manager Alan Irvine. \u201cI was chatting to G\u00e9rard after the game and we both found ourselves taking about Steven Gerrard,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cObviously he knows him very well but we both think he is still a terrific player. Wherever he plays he is still a key player for Liverpool, and anyone who thinks his legs have gone needs to have a look at the time he chased Cristian Gamboa down the wing and stayed with him. That took some doing, so I am not having it that he is finished. He has been a great player for many years and will continue to be for some time yet.\u201d Making his debut for West Brom at right-back in place of the ineligible Andre Wisdom, Gamboa was one of the small successes for West Brom. Saido Berahino was another, and West Brom could conceivably have taken something from the game had he converted one of his first-half chances to put them in front. \u201cEven at his very best he will still miss a few,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of being a striker. Saido knows he needs to improve on his heading too, but he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s got a fantastic approach and great enthusiasm and he\u2019ll get better as a finisher as time goes on.\u201d As it was Berahino scored from the penalty spot to equalise Adam Lallana\u2019s opening goal after Dejan Lovren had brought him down on the edge of the box \u2013 actually outside the area as both managers accepted when they saw the replays \u2013 but West Brom were level for only four minutes until Jordan Henderson sidefooted in with Raheem Sterling still appealing for a penalty for a shove by Craig Gardner. Only then was Balotelli introduced from the bench, curtailing a frustrating match for Rickie Lambert, who must have been envious at seeing Lallana get off the mark with his first Liverpool goal. Despite Gerrard\u2019s best efforts when Philippe Coutinho came off for Lucas Leiva, Liverpool could not add to their lead, though West Brom\u2019s organisation deserves some of the credit for that. Liverpool were not at their best, with Sterling and Coutinho only fitfully contributing, but the visitors were much improved on the side who struggled so badly towards the end of last season. \u201cRaheem will always give 100%,\u201d Rodgers said of his England forward. \u201cHe does his best, but from time to time he will have games where he doesn\u2019t set the world alight. His next contract is not a big issue for us. We know he is happy here, his agent understands that he is in the perfect place, so everything is calm. No one is thinking of anything other than Raheem continuing to play for Liverpool. Ian Ayre has spoken with his representatives and he is quite relaxed.\u201d Man of the match Jordan Henderson (Liverpool)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
