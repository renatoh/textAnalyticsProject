You might not appreciate the dating show\u2019s rowdiness; its relentlessness (nearly 50 episodes this season!); its raunch. But even if you\u2019re able to tolerate all that, you might draw a line at the language. I\u2019m not talking about swearing, because there\u2019s something even worse, apparently: Love Islanders\u2019 liberality with their discourse particles. This is not an innuendo. You can\u2019t catch discourse particles. No, they are little words we use to signpost and structure our speech. Sometimes they are just used to maintain fluency, or to generate rapport. In short, they oil the wheels of communication. One of the big players is \u201clike\u201d. According to the Sunday Times this week, it was used 76 times in under five minutes during one episode of the ITV reality show. The paper provided an example from Islander Amy: \u201cMolly was like \u2018oh he\u2019s my type\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018no sorry you\u2019ve already got two\u2019. It\u2019s like three out of seven boys.\u201d (Not all of these likes are discourse particles, but more of that later.) For some, this is simply too much. And since the Islanders, and their audience, are mostly young, there\u2019s concern at what the like-glut means for the future of the English language. How can we stop it taking over, until, like, there\u2019s nothing left? One primary school in Bradford is taking a hard line against the word, to the delight of the education minister, Nick Gibb, who suggested others follow suit. The headteacher, Christabel Shepherd, said: \u201cIt\u2019s when children are giving you an answer and they say \u2018is it, like, when you\u2019re, like \u2026\u2019 and they haven\u2019t actually made a sentence at all. They use the word all the time and we are trying to get rid of it.\u201d Good luck, Miss Shepherd. Linguistic edicts of this kind have a low-to-zero chance of success. I just had a conversation with an eminent professor of linguistics and \u201clike\u201d popped up several times. Why is it OK for us but not for children? Informal \u201clike\u201d is well established and it\u2019s too late \u2013 and potentially cruel \u2013 to attempt to stop them using it. The more interesting question is why it seems to generate such disapproval. But before we turn to that, it\u2019s worth charting like\u2019s long journey, from Old English to ITV. The word was once gelic, which meant \u201calike\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d. The -lic part derives from words meaning \u201cbody\u201d or \u201cform\u201d, so that we can think of it as meaning \u201chaving the form of\u201d (a lychgate is the gate a body passes through on its way to a Christian graveyard). This is already a highly significant word, then. The act of comparing two or more objects is fundamental. The related faculty of analogy making \u2013 between things, but also between ideas and feelings \u2013 is equally important. It wouldn\u2019t be at all surprising if a word linked to these basic aspects of human cognition were recruited to serve a wide range of related meanings, branching off in subtly different directions. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. The Oxford English Dictionary has three principal and nearly 50 sub-definitions of \u201clike\u201d used as an adjective, adverb, conjunction and preposition. They range from \u201cresembling\u201d to \u201ccharacteristic or typical of\u201d to \u201cshowing a likelihood or probability of\u201d and \u201csuggesting that [a] statement is approximate\u201d. The examples given stretch back many hundreds of years, covering a long period of gradual evolution. And as you would expect, some uses are more recent than others. For our purposes, it\u2019s worth focusing on two in particular. The first is \u201cas a marker, intensifier, or filler in conversation or spoken discourse to introduce or focus attention on a following statement or question\u201d. The earliest written examples are from the 1950s: \u201cLike wow \u2026 wonderful\u201d is a line from She magazine in 1959. This is \u201clike\u201d as a discourse particle. The second use is \u201cwith a verb, introducing reported speech\u201d, and the earliest example is from Time magazine in 1970: \u201cAfterward, a girl came up to me and said, \u2018You kinda look interested in this; did you know there are civil rights for women?\u2019 And I thought like wow, this is for me.\u201d This is so-called quotative \u201clike\u201d \u2013 although in this case the words being quoted are thoughts. In the Sunday Times example, you\u2019ll notice that two out of the three \u201clikes\u201d are quotative. In both these uses \u201clike\u201d appears to have inched away from its core territory. Rather than having to do with similarity, the word seems to mean less, and to have become more functional. Linguists refer to this process as grammaticalisation. It often happens to words that have elemental meanings and are used regularly. They become semantically \u201cbleached\u201d, and start to play a role in the organisation of the sentence, instead. Grammaticalisation is perfectly natural and has happened many times in the history of English. Take the word \u201cindeed\u201d. This once meant literally \u201cin action\u201d (as opposed to \u201cin thought\u201d), before undergoing bleaching. In an example from 1580, Thomas Wilson writes \u201cI trust that not onely all men will commende justice in worde, but also will live justly in deede.\u201d It\u2019s now much more of an organising word instead. Similarly, \u201clook\u201d, used at the beginning of a sentence, is merely a discourse marker. But this grew out of its use as a call to direct someone\u2019s (visual) attention to something. \u201cLike\u201d plays such a fundamental role in the lexicon that it\u2019s been recruited for grammaticalisation not once but twice: as both discourse particle and quotative. These two forms now have different functions, and it might be useful to think of them as homophones: words which have the same sound but signify different things. A sentence containing both versions can sound like a bit of a barrage \u2013 but you can\u2019t exactly blame Love Islanders like Amy for the way English has evolved. As so often in language, the prejudice seems to be against the informal, and the new, which is erroneously branded \u201csloppy\u201d or \u201cdumb\u201d. There\u2019s no evidence that it is. People probably once said that about the non-literal use of \u201cindeed\u201d \u2013 no one would now. And we shouldn\u2019t shame schoolchildren either. It\u2019s fine for teachers to point out that \u201clike\u201d is generally used in more informal contexts. But when it crops up in pupils\u2019 speech \u2013 well, that could be an opportunity to teach children about the history of English, and the amazing process of grammaticalisation, which is one that rolls on and on whatever our feelings about it, like the waves lapping at Canute\u2019s feet. \u2022 David Shariatmadari is a Guardian editor and writer.
