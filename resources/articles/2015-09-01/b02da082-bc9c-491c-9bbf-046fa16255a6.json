For the second debate on 16 September in California, CNN is asking $200,000 (\u00a3130,000), 40 times its normal rate, for a 30-second prime-time spot. TV advertising strategists say it is hard to quantify Trump\u2019s value to the media, or the value of non-stop free media attention to Trump\u2019s commanding lead over the Republican field, but CNN\u2019s ad price is a good indicator. \u201cCNN have put a huge price tag on the upcoming debate and they\u2019re selling it like a major sporting event,\u201d says David Campanelli of Horizon Media, a New York TV sales and research firm. \u201cThis early on in the political process we can be 100% certain it\u2019s related to Donald Trump.\u201d Some analysts have gone further in their assessment, calling the Celebrity Apprentice star \u201cthe Simon Cowell of politics\u201d owing to his habit of making blunt assessments. He described Jeb Bush, his closest rival polling at less than half Trump\u2019s 30%, as \u201clow-energy\u201d. Trump\u2019s ratings draw is reported to be behind the willingness of TV newscasters to interview the candidate at the Trump Tower, with its backdrop of Trump branding, rather than risk losing him by insisting he come to them. Even NBC, which ended its relationship with Trump in June after he disparaged Mexican immigrants, signalled its willingness to repair relations by inviting him on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon next Friday. TV producers say they consider Trump an \u201cexceptionally desirable\u201d guest. This convergence of politics and entertainment has left many uncertain how to handle the candidate. When Fox News\u2019s Megyn Kelly attempted to address Trump on issues of character and not policy, in the first debate, it resulted in a backlash against Fox, not Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor of California,\u201d says Billie Gold at the TV sales and research firm Carat. \u201cOnce you have a known figure, they take on a character. Trump is saying things you don\u2019t normally hear in politics and people are curious to know what his plans are.\u201d TV producers warn that, if Trump\u2019s ratings begin to fall, news producers will turn to him less. But Gold says she\u2019s not so sure the Trump phenomenon will die down. \u201cHe\u2019s great for the news media because he\u2019s so polarising, entertaining and different. That\u2019s why they\u2019re talking about him wall-to-wall. For the cable news outlets, this is huge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
