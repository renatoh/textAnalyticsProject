I really am. I know it\u2019s frustrating that any new young female writer must find themselves compared to Sally Rooney. But I\u2019m going to just get it out of the way, for Naoise Dolan is Irish, in her mid-20s, and her debut was previewed in literary magazine The Stinging Fly while Rooney edited it. But on this occasion, it\u2019s more than just a question of biography: Dolan\u2019s writing does genuinely occupy similar territory. There\u2019s a certain dry, almost deadpan quality in her observation of the lives of her twentysomething characters \u2013 the complications of attraction, and the gap between what\u2019s felt and what\u2019s spoken; calmly articulated self-loathing, and precise capturing of class differences \u2013 that both authors nail down dead. So lucky us, really. Exciting Times is a fun, snappy read \u2013 ordinarily, I\u2019d say its short chapters could be torn through on your commute, but it\u2019ll brighten lockdown too. Ava is a 21-year-old who leaves Ireland, where she\u2019s convinced everyone hates her, to become a teacher of English as a foreign language in Hong Kong. Despite the chip on her shoulder, she falls in with Julian, an Eton-educated English banker who she enjoys being with because they (supposedly) aren\u2019t that interested in each other: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like normal friendships where I worried if the other person still liked me.\u201d She moves into his swanky apartment, rent-free, and they have sex. \u201cI enjoyed his money and he enjoyed how easily impressed I was by it.\u201d If in part one, Ava feels held at a frustrating distance \u2013 why is she so hard on herself? What does she see in this man? \u2013 in part two, we watch her coming into the light. And also coming out: Ava slowly falls for Edith, a Hong Kong lawyer. Edith is curious and enthusiastic, and Ava can no longer maintain her detached, \u201cironical\u201d approach to life \u2013 feelings flower all over the place. Feelings for Edith but, confusingly, also for Julian. They trip her up and get in the way. Exciting Times is very funny in its cool observation and the way it takes us inside Ava\u2019s spirals of overthinking. Dolan\u2019s writing is extremely sharp \u2013 both cutting and tart \u2013 but there are places where it feels overly cynical. Ava eventually comes to recognise that her cynicism is the protective garb of youth, but it is something the book also struggles to shrug off. Dolan seasons the novel with insights about class, gender, race, colonialism, and language, though the result does not always bring depth of flavour. The most insightful \u2013 and raw \u2013 of these are the caustic observations about Ireland\u2019s repressive attitudes to homosexuality and abortionand how they damage individual lives. It all adds up to a bracing, refreshing first novel, with hints of greater things to come. \u2022 Exciting Times by Naoise Dolan is published by W&amp;N (\u00a314.99)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
