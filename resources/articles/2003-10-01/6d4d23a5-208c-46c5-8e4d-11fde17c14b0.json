The Portuguese holders of the Uefa Cup grabbed an early lead through Costinha but Madrid were back in control by half-time through the Spanish midfielder Ivan Helguera and Argentinian Santiago Solari. Zinedine Zidane scored Madrid's third. Marseille recovered from their opening defeat by Madrid when a second half hat-trick from Didier Drogba brought a 3-0 win over the 10 men of Partizan Belgrade. The Serbs had Andrija Delibasic sent off at the end of the first half. The European champions Milan hung on for a goalless draw away to Celta Vigo in Spain. Celta put their act together on the pitch despite a pay dispute which had seen their players storm out of the team hotel on Tuesday. The other group H tie saw Ajax recover from their opening defeat by Milan to beat Belgian champions Brugge 2-0 with a goal in each half from the Belgian international Wesley Sonck. Sparta Prague almost sprang another surprise in Chelsea's group G when they took a two-goal half-time lead over Lazio in Rome. Libor Sionko and skipper Karel Poborsky scored the Czech goals but Simone Inzaghi struck back after nine seconds and 15 minutes (penalty) of the second half to rescue Lazio's 2-2 draw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
