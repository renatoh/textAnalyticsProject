Giuliani also asserted he was \u201cmore of a Jew than Soros\u201d and repeated a claim that the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who testified in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry, was controlled by the financier. The Anti-Defamation League CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, furiously rebuked Giuliani, who is of Italian descent and was raised Roman Catholic, describing his comments as \u201cbaffling and offensive\u201d and a \u201cdog whistle to hardcore antisemites and white supremacists who believe this garbage\u201d. Greenblatt called on Giuliani to \u201capologize and retract his comments immediately\u201d. The central thrust and larger offense caused by Giuliani\u2019s comments, which were made during an interview with New York magazine, the group argued, was to repeat a trope about the financier controlling political appointments and events. Soros is widely recognized for funding progressive political and social causes. To those accusations Greenblatt tweeted: \u201cOpposing Soros isn\u2019t what\u2019s #antiSemitic. Saying that he controls ambassadors, employs FBI agents and isn\u2019t \u2018Jewish enough\u2019 to be demonized is.\u201d In an article published on its website in October, the ADL said: \u201cIn far-right circles worldwide, Soros\u2019 philanthropy often is recast as fodder for outsized conspiracy theories, including claims that he masterminds specific global plots or manipulates particular events to further his goals.\u201d The American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group, tweeted a stinging riposte to Giuliani, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your views, and to denouncing his [Soros\u2019s]. But it\u2019s offensive to deny anyone\u2019s faith, and worse to endorse classically antisemitic conspiracy theories.\u201d In an interview with the Guardian last month, Soros said repeated attacks against him from the right, both in their intensity and number, served to sustain him. \u201cIt challenges me and therefore it energises me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I look at the list of people, or movements, or countries who are attacking me, it makes me feel I must be doing something right. I\u2019m proud of the enemies I have.\u201d The 86-year-old Soros, who survived the Nazi occupation of his native Hungary, was said by Giuliani to be behind ambassadorial appointments and \u201cemploying the FBI agents\u201d, in an unexplained claim that the magazine described as him \u201cweaving one made-up talking point into another and another\u201d. Challenged on his views, Giuliani retorted: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m antisemitic if I oppose him.\u201d \u201cSoros is hardly a Jew,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m more of a Jew than Soros is. I probably know more about \u2013 he doesn\u2019t go to church, he doesn\u2019t go to religion \u2013 synagogue. He doesn\u2019t belong to a synagogue, he doesn\u2019t support Israel, he\u2019s an enemy of Israel.\u201d But Giuliani shows no sign of retracting or moderating his comments. Asked by NBC News if his remarks were seriously intended, the former mayor texted: \u201cI\u2019m more Jewish than half my friends.\u201d Soros, who emigrated to the UK in 1947 where he attended the London School of Economics is believed to have a net worth of around $8bn, having given around $32bn to his philanthropic agency, the Open Society Foundations, known for supporting global democratic causes. In the US alone, the group is reported to have given $33m in financial support to civil rights and social justice organizations, among them efforts to bring justice to bear in several high-profile killings of African American men by law enforcement. A spokeswoman for Soros\u2019s foundations, Laura Silber, on Tuesday called Giuliani\u2019s remarks \u201ccontemptible,\u201d tweeting that they \u201creflect his toxic campaign of misinformation and falsehoods aimed at distracting from the gravity of the charges facing the president\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
