The national manager will recall Joe Hart, Kyle Walker and Gary Cahill to his starting lineup for the friendly against Brazil on Tuesday night, but Ruben Loftus-Cheek is expected to retain a place in midfield after his hugely encouraging debut against Germany. Lewis Cook and Dominic Solanke, key performers in the under-20s\u2019 World Cup success over the summer but inexperienced at Premier League level, will hope for involvement from the bench, while Marcus Rashford, now 20, should start and Joe Gomez will gain a second cap at some stage after his substitute appearance last Friday. Loftus-Cheek, a player who has made only 12 top-flight starts and is on loan at Crystal Palace, would have been picked for the last two World Cup qualifiers in October had he been fit but the youngsters called up to the current squad are effectively making the most of the withdrawal of eight seniors with various knocks and niggles. The FA\u2019s medical staff were satisfied by the validity of those injuries, for all that the players would expect to feature for their clubs this weekend. Chelsea\u2019s Danny Drinkwater turned down the chance to join up after suffering a relapse of a calf problem. Southgate has already handed out 13 debuts in as many matches in charge. Asked if the praise heaped on new faces such as Loftus-Cheek and Jordan Pickford since Friday\u2019s draw with the World Cup holders might mean players consider the wider picture before dropping out, he said: \u201cYes, that\u2019s what you want to get to as a team, that the competition for places is so intense. [Philippe] Coutinho hasn\u2019t played for a few weeks for Liverpool but he is there for Brazil. I imagine part of that is because he is thinking: \u2018If I\u2019m not there and I\u2019m not playing and someone else goes in, do I get the shirt back?\u2019 Maybe we haven\u2019t had that but I think, moving forward, we will have, and I think that will affect people\u2019s approach definitely. \u201cSomeone said to me, \u2018[the emergence of young talent] is causing you selection headaches\u2019. No, because you want competition for places. The best way to get the maximum out of a player is competition for your place and no opportunity to take [your foot] off the gas in training or in any of the matches. And then you have to perform. You support people in difficult moments but, equally, when you have got that competition it drives the level of training. The energy in training has been high.\u201d England have beaten Brazil only once since 1990, with Southgate describing the team ranked No2 in the world as \u201ca juggernaut\u201d. While the hope is the home side build on the promise displayed against Germany, there is a realism among the management staff \u2013 and within the FA \u2013 that short-term results may be risked in favour of long\u2011term development. \u201cThe more you beat those top teams then, of course, you take that confidence with you, but I have to balance our desire to win games with some experimentation that does mean you do risk results,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe could set up to play a certain way to give ourselves a better chance of winning any individual game, with more experienced players. \u201cWe could take the short-term view regarding who might be more experienced going into a tournament and have more big-match experience, or we think outside the box and have a look at a few players we want to find out more about and see how they cope. There\u2019s something bigger I\u2019m working for than just getting results in the short-term and my own personal ambitions. If you\u2019re a coach your mindset has to be to help people improve and maximise what\u2019s possible. It is the right decision for England. \u201cWhen it comes to the World Cup, I will go with what I think is the best squad. At the moment, I believe the best would include a lot those young players. It\u2019s easy to be swayed at times by needing experience, but you can have 100 experiences of the same thing or 10 different experiences that make you a more rounded person. These young players have also had experience of winning youth tournaments, playing high-level matches, and challenges to get to where they are in their path. So they\u2019ve had to show some resilience of their own. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have a team full of players who have won the Champions League but we haven\u2019t got that. But I want players who will be fearless, prepared to have the ball and show what they are capable of on the biggest stage.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
