Wilko Johnson, the former Dr Feelgood guitarist and sometime member of the Blockheads, can often be spotted ambling the streets of his hometown but last night he took to the stage to play an emotional set with his band in front of thousands of fans. The gig at the Village Green Festival came a day after Johnson's 66th birthday and is likely to prove his final chance to play for those he has known and lived nearby all his life. Suffering with pancreatic cancer diagnosed in January, Johnson was pleased to top the bill since ill health had forced him to cancel a Canvey Island show this spring. \"You have got to book gigs fairly well in advance, and I don't know how well I am going to be in advance,\" he told the Observer before going on stage yesterday. \"I had a farewell tour in April and I retired after that. But I was feeling a bit better and so I thought I could take a bit more on.\" The festival in Chalkwell Park is close to his house and not far from the area known affectionately by Dr Feelgood fans as the Thames Delta, the place where pub rock took hold in the 1970s. It is where it all started for Johnson and a place that still takes up a big space in his head. \"I always imagine my songs somehow taking place around here,\" he said. \"When I was a teenager it seemed dreadfully mundane to me; not nearly exciting enough. Now I can see that there is a lot here that can be mythologised. I spend a lot of time thinking about this place.\" Johnson does not like sentiment and said he might feel the same way about anywhere else he had grown up: \"But I have spent more or less my whole life within spitting distance of the Thames estuary. I have been all around the world and I always come back here.\" These days he gets up early and, since the diagnosis, he has hit a productive songwriting patch. \"So I thought I should try to get an album out before I die. But this is a rather indeterminate time for me so sometimes I do wonder what the bloody point is. The last songs, strangely enough, contain a lot of metaphors for death. It is not too heavy though, don't worry.\" A fresh perspective has been gifted to him, he conceded, by his inconvenient, malevolent disease. \"You may not get wisdom but illness changes your perspective on everything, and it has been a wonderful year in many ways.\" It is a sensation he can only liken to an excitement remembered from youth. He described a feeling \"so strong and definite\" that it has altered his entire attitude. \"You are walking along with a different consciousness,\" he said. \"You look at other people and think they are all living under that terrible threat of mortality. For me though, it is sorted out, and that sets me apart.\" \"I am getting the sort of insights that cannot be obtained any other way, whether about the smallest action or the largest feelings that you may have for friends. Things are not exactly clear, because it is more complicated than that, but you see you have to live life as it comes and as it goes, and we don't realise that until we have to. Death for me now is not something in the indefinite future, it is in the immediate future. I am not going to come out with a book of sayings, though.\" After he founded Dr Feelgood on Canvey Island in the early 1970s, Johnson's odd, choppy guitar sound soon became identified with a musical movement. \"For me it was the 60s and the Rolling Stones that determined my music,\" he said. He insisted that his songs are simple to understand and don't need explaining anywhere. \"I am not trying to make any statements, and I don't see it in any context.\" He left the band in 1977. Performers, said Johnson, should want to create rather than to be famous: \"Somewhere inside, I think everybody wants to be a hero. I still feel like that when I walk on to a stage.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
