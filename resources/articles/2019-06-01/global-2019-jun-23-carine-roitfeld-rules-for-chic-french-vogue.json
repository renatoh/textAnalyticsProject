Naturally, what this means to me is that the thought of meeting her is absolutely terrifying, so I sit down in the Parisian hotel where we have arranged to do the interview and tell her this. She is dressed in black, of course, her slightly hunched posture making her look more like her 64 years. She is sipping a tiny coffee, and isn\u2019t remotely surprised I\u2019m terrified. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m judging, but I\u2019m not judging,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m watching. It\u2019s different. People sometimes say, \u2018My God her eyes will scan you,\u2019 but it\u2019s not to judge you. It\u2019s to get ideas. It\u2019s observation.\u201d Well that\u2019s all right then. French Vogue, under her tenure from 2001 to 2011, was a force to be reckoned with. It looked like nothing else. She believed in bold ideas and she loved boobs, even naked on the cover. She loved cigarettes dangling from models\u2019 mouths. She loved fur. And she loved curves. She used unskinny models Crystal Renn and Lara Stone, and did a cover with the blonde, mainstream-looking model Carolyn Murphy prancing around with Andre J, a black transgender model in a dress and a beard. \u201cWould Anna Wintour ever allow such a thing?\u201d asked the American website Jezebel at the time. I have brought the current issue of French Vogue with me and we flick through it together. All the models are the exact same skinniness. \u201cI do not like this,\u201d she says. \u201cI like older women. I like bigger girls. I like black women. I did everything first. But people forget, because people forget everything. I feel totally comfortable with everyone. It is my strength, to be open-minded, always.\u201d It does seem to be true \u2013 she is even interested in my red handbag, which is made of fake leather, cost about \u00a350 from a small animal-friendly brand she\u2019s never heard of, and is bursting at the seams \u201cbecause you put too much stuff in it,\u201d she says, as if she\u2019s my mum. After too many years spent reading all those books about how to be chic like a Frenchwoman and hating them so much I\u2019d feel compelled to go straight out and buy one about how to date like them, too, and then how to raise children who eat like French enfants, I feel I should be expert in how to be an insouciant yet glamorous Parisian \u2013 except it hasn\u2019t worked at all. I am not remotely chic. My love life is so English it\u2019s practically Chaucerian. My child subsists on potatoes. So I want to ask this most Parisienne of Parisiennes for her secrets \u2013 can she make me chic? I have this scarf, you see, and every time I tie it in a knot it doesn\u2019t look right. I ask her to tie it better on me, but she takes it off me and ties it better on herself \u2013 by not tying it at all. \u201cNever a knot,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I learned this from Tom Ford, not France.\u201d She shows me that you either wrap it around your neck once with two long ends dangling down either side of your chest, or you fold it so it\u2019s doubled over and half the length and then thread it through itself a little bit like a tie. Not a knot, you understand. I ask Roitfeld, when I look at a Parisian woman who doesn\u2019t have much makeup on and is in a simple navy sweater and jeans and yet looks stunning, what is she spending her money on. What has she paid for that I can\u2019t see? Is it a dermatologist? Roitfeld nods \u2013 I have hit the nail on the head. \u201cTo be beautiful costs so much money,\u201d she agrees. \u201cFor something you don\u2019t see.\u201d She favours the aesthetician Herv\u00e9 Herau for her own skin treatments, which she suggests are just a bit of cream, really. She is not keen on younger women getting Botox at all, while she thinks older women often overdo it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to name names but there are some who can\u2019t move their faces any more. Like Cher.\u201d Roitfeld also says that French style is quite conservative, so the chicness comes from a certain coolness in attitude, a lack of overt polishedness, as well as the cut of the trenchcoat, the quality of the shoe. But she insists she prefers English style \u201cbecause we are not good at fantasy, French people. In New York you see all this crazy nail art and I love that, too, but we French are more quiet, discreet.\u201d But how, how do I become chic? There must be a way. She looks at me sympathetically. \u201cChic,\u201d replies Carine Roitfeld, \u201cis innate.\u201d Ah. In the years after leaving Vogue in 2011, her son Vladimir worked on convincing her that her name was valuable and that rather than keep only working for other brands she could become one herself. She was surprised, but she trusted him, and gradually they went into business together, launching her bi-annual magazine CR Fashion Book, her creative talent agency CR Studio, and now her Carine Roitfeld Parfums, for which she has created her 7 Lovers range, sold exclusively at Net-a-Porter, each perfume is named after a different fantasy lover from her imagination. So there is the English lover, called George, like our royal prince, \u201cYes, like him, your future queen,\u201d she says, suggesting either a language barrier or that she knows something I don\u2019t about Prince William\u2019s son. George the perfume started off quite green, so she added a shot of cannabis and a shot of espresso to the mix, as you do. Then there\u2019s Sebastian, who comes from Buenos Aires and is as dark and troublesome as the tango, and smells spicy and woody and is \u201ca very selfish lover, the fight between life and death is what I want for him, he\u2019s very proud of himself\u201d. So he\u2019s the one you shouldn\u2019t marry, I suggest. \u201cOh maybe you should,\u201d she replies, quite seriously. My Englishness floats around me like virginity. Her daughter, Julia Restoin Roitfeld, has also been involved, having taken a nude photo of her mother a couple of years ago that they decided to use for her marketing, after checking with Vladimir. \u201cIf he say I can do it, I can do it.\u201d She says the French aren\u2019t hung up on nudity like we are, although when her own Russian father would parade naked around their French apartment during her childhood, the neighbours did sometimes call the police, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t like to see it in front of their windows. But he didn\u2019t care.\u201d Vladimir also encouraged her to put a Muslim model in a hijab on the cover of her own magazine. The model was Halima Aden, a Somali who was born in a refugee camp in Kenya before moving to America as a child, becoming her American school\u2019s homecoming queen and entering Miss Minnesota. Roitfeld saw those photographs, used her on the cover and Aden now has a high-profile modelling career, having now appeared on the cover of British Vogue, too. \u201cWhen I\u2019m thinking about something he say yes you can do this no you can not do this. He gives a balance to me, which I need, because I\u2019m a bit fearless, I can go too far. When I put this girl with the Muslim scarf I was not sure because no one did it before. But he say, \u2018I think it\u2019s you, do it. Even if some people kill you, it\u2019s you, do it. You open minds.\u2019\u201d At this point I realise this went beyond a cultural or fashion decision \u2013 she genuinely thought she might get murdered. \u201cAnd they do kill me, but it\u2019s OK.\u201d Wait, Carine, nobody killed you, you\u2019re still here. You mean you were\u2026 criticised? \u201cYes, but a lot. It\u2019s different in different countries. When you\u2019re doing something new, it\u2019s normal to have critics. Every time I did a new thing I get criticised, but funnily I do a new thing because it\u2019s my way of thinking, my way of loving people. I\u2019m very open-minded. This girl was so beautiful, and she wore her scarf, and there are a lot of girls in scarves in fashion now \u2013 you\u2019re not going to put them away from fashion, they\u2019re too big now.\u201d I mention how multicultural British Vogue has become under its new editor Edward Enninful. It\u2019s been a huge shift. \u201cYes, good! But he took my girl! He take my model! Halima become a huge voice now and great for her. I find other ones. It\u2019s part of the world today.\u201d On the one hand, CR is from a world of French chic that is, to me, impenetrable. On the other, she is really very funny and tells me that she likes makeup best when you only take half of it off at night \u201cso you\u2019ve got black smudged around your eyes the next day, and this is why people think French women are dirty,\u201d and that she doesn\u2019t follow the supermodel maxim about obsessively moisturising on aeroplanes, \u201cbecause I\u2019m always too cold, I just put my big sunglasses on when I land.\u201d Her high-powered morning health routine is composed of the two major nutrients, \u201cespresso and cigarettes\u201d, and she doesn\u2019t like seeing women doing their makeup in their cars, on their way to work. Because it\u2019s vulgar? \u201cBecause it\u2019s dangerous!\u201d As for her own relationship with the mirror, \u201cI\u2019m lucky because I\u2019m rather blind now so I don\u2019t see myself very well, it\u2019s much better. Although I have to do my makeup in one of those amplified mirrors. Horrifying.\u201d She did ask Tom Ford to show her how to take a good selfie, help her find her angle, \u201cbut he say to me: \u2018Oh, you do not have a good angle Carine.\u2019 I say: \u2018Thank you Tom, that is nice of you.\u2019 He say: \u2018No no it is better that someone else takes your picture.\u2019 I say: \u2018OK, nice, stop. Do not say that.\u2019 So I do not take selfies.\u201d She misses Karl Lagerfeld. \u201cI really lost someone very important for me. My father died 20 years ago and Karl was\u2026 not a new father for me, but a protector.\u201d Since he died in February, she has taken on the role of style adviser at his namesake brand. I ask if he used to phone her a lot, but no, he would just text her photos of his cat, Choupette. \u201cHe was the king of sending big bunches of flowers and handwritten letters. No one else does it like this.\u201d We meet just before French Mother\u2019s Day, and she has been thinking about this, the first one since his death. \u201cI know I will not get my flowers from him with the card saying you are a great stylist and a great mum. Mother\u2019s Day is different date in each country, how could he even know it was Mother\u2019s Day?\u201d She has become so tender at this bittersweet memory that I wonder, almost dreamily, what sort of mum she was. \u201cI was very tough with them. Screaming at them. Brush your teeth, go now to school, go and clean the car if you get a bad mark at school, make your bed, clean the kitchen even if the maid is coming. Say thank you to the taxi driver, say thank you to the waiter in the restaurant. My kids are well brought up because I was so tough with them. But I was very dedicated to them, too.\u201d Every Saturday she would take Vladimir to play football; Julia every Sunday to ride horses. She sent them to a bilingual school in Paris so they learned perfect English and now they both live in New York. She feels confident her parenting was a success, because, as adults, \u201cThey are very polite, they\u2019re working and they\u2019re not taking drugs. And my daughter would never leave her apartment without making her bed.\u201d So how does it feel to be the most glamorous grandma in the world, now that Julia has a daughter, Romy? \u201cOh, but on Instagram I see a lot of glamorous grandmothers. Andrea Dellal, who lives in Rio and used to be a model. She is very glamorous and she has seven grandchildren. Very funny and laughing all the time, which is what I love, and she has good bones. And she has this, which I don\u2019t have,\u201d she says, pointing at her lack of cleavage. \u201cBut grandmothers now are not like before. My own grandmother seemed so old with her white hair. I dye mine.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t ever let it all out and go fully grey yourself? \u201cNever say never but\u2026 certainly not.\u201d She says it\u2019s only younger people who could think the problem with ageing is wrinkles anyway, and that once you get old, you realise that the real trouble is your back, and your eyes going. Roitfeld tells me that six years ago, she had a bad fall, leading to seven operations on her back. \u201cI have very fragile bones. I got the ears of my dad and the backbones of my mum.\u201d I ask if she is in pain at all times, and for the first time she pauses before answering. I sense she doesn\u2019t feel able to admit it, or to complain. \u201cI have some good drugs,\u201d she says, slightly quietly. She then insists that she has to keep wearing heels because flat shoes are, according to her, not good for your back, at which point I realise that chicness is not so much innate as incurable. Even if she\u2019s not leaving the house, there are three things Carine Roitfeld never fails to apply every morning: \u201cA bit of cream, a bit of black, a bit of perfume.\u201d And there we have it: my new mantra. That night, I try her trick of leaving on my eyeliner and mascara and the next morning, oh my goodness, the transformation has actually worked. All right, so it\u2019s my transformation into a panda rather than a Parisian, but still. The 8th arrondissement wasn\u2019t built in a day.
