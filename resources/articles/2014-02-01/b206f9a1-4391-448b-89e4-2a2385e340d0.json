Over the course of a dozen years the 59-year-old has established a reputation as one of the most unapologetically efficient managers. It is no coincidence his teams have never been relegated from the top flight. While others flaunted possession-based football, Allardyce cut down errors and maximised opportunities. It made West Ham's slide this season all the more surprising. A side that invariably lost at home, that experimented with strikerless systems, that incurred needless red cards and kept conceding at set-pieces, were the antithesis of many an Allardyce group. Normal service has been restored. \"Now we are starting not only to keep clean sheets but we are scoring goals as well,\" said the Hammers' manager, outlining the basics of his formula. \"Really, it is about not making silly mistakes the opposition capitalise on.\" So, by Allardyce's definition, if matches are won and lost in and around either box, this almost amounted to a flawless performance by West Ham. Aston Villa's failings cost them, whether it was Nathan Baker's inability to clear George McCartney's long ball immediately after half-time or Fabian Delph's hesitancy as he dallied on the ball. \"You'd probably have rather seen the ball go into Row Z,\" said their manager, Paul Lambert. Instead, it went into the Villa goal as Kevin Nolan robbed Delph to score for the second time in three minutes. It left Lambert lamenting the follies of youth \u2013 \"You are only young for so long,\" he said \u2013 and a realist content to rely on the tried and trusted. \"Apart from [January signings] Marco [Borriello] and Antonio [Nocerino], every [outfield] player on that field has a huge amount of Premier League experience,\" said Allardyce. The safety-first, been-there-and-done-that method of management prevailed. History, whether Allardyce's track record or his players' past, provides United with reassurance. Nolan has tended to be a mid-table Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard, offering a guarantee of goals, and he took his career total to 97 in the league. Allardyce added: \"He is a top Premier League goalscorer as a midfield player. There are not too many about at the moment and he has continued to do that for the last 10 or 11 years.\" Allies are indelibly associated but perhaps, Nolan argued, the regularity of his output means he is taken for granted by others. He is damned with faint praise. \"It's easy saying: 'Oh, he gets 10 or 12 a season',\" he explained. \"My goals that matter are the ones that ensure we have got a point or three.\" A second successive pair allowed West Ham to pocket six points in the space of eight days. The captain is providing one half of Allardyce's match-winning equation. \"To have 12 clean sheets is the highest in the Premier League,\" Nolan said. \"It just shows it's been goals that we have been missing this season. Now I've started to chip in with a couple.\" Indeed, while West Ham only escaped the relegation zone on Saturday, they are league leaders in the shutout standings. Individually, the quartet of Guy Demel, James Collins, James Tomkins and George McCartney would garner few points in any poll to identify the division's best players in their respective positions. Collectively, the Hammers back four have proved to be remarkably resilient. If Norwich fail to score on Tuesday, West Ham will keep a fourth consecutive clean sheet in the top tier for the first time since 1985. While Jos\u00e9 Mourinho disparagingly deemed the Hammers guilty of playing \"19th century football\", this is 80s-style defending. Like much else Allardyce has done, it is proving hugely effective.
