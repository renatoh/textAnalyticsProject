The vote of 274 to 12, a majority of 262, on a backbench motion has no practical impact on British government policy and ministers were instructed not to vote. Labour decided to impose a one-line whip, and the Liberal Democrats, like the Conservatives, gave their backbenchers a free vote. In possibly the single most important contribution in an emotional debate, Richard Ottaway, the Conservative chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said the recent annexation of West Bank land by the Israeli government had angered him like nothing else in politics. The Conservative MP said he had been a supporter of the state of Israel before he became a Tory and had close family connections with the generation that formed the Israeli state. He explained: \u201cThe Holocaust had a deep impact on me growing up in the wake of the second world war,\u201d adding that he had been a strong supporter of Israel in the six day war and subsequent conflicts. He told MPs: \u201cLooking back over the past 20 years, I realise now Israel has slowly been drifting away from world public opinion. The annexation of the 950 acres of the West Bank just a few months ago has outraged me more than anything else in my political life. It has made me look a fool and that is something I deeply resent.\u201d He said he was not yet convinced that Palestine was fit to be a state due to its refusal to recognise Israel, adding that \u201cin normal circumstances\u201d he would have opposed the motion. But, he said, \u201csuch is my anger with the behaviour of Israel in recent months that I will not be opposing this motion. I have to say to the government of Israel: if it is losing people like me, it is going to be losing a lot of people.\u201d The former foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said the vote was not simply a gesture, because if it were, the Israeli government would not be as worried by the vote. The Israeli government, he said, wants the recognition of the Palestinian state only at the successful conclusion of any negotiations. But Straw said \u201csuch an approach would give the Israelis a veto over whether a Palestinian state should exist\u201d. A vote for recognition would add to the pressure on the Israeli government, he said. \u201cThe only thing that the Israeli government, in my view, in its present demeanour under Bibi Netanyahu understands is pressure.\u201d Straw moved an amendment to the motion setting out that the UK government should recognise Palestine \u201cas a contribution to securing a negotiated two-state solution\u201d. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former Conservative foreign secretary, said it had been British policy for generations that a state is recognised when the territory in question has a government, an army and a military capability. Conservative James Clappison spoke out against the motion, arguing it would do more harm than good. He said: \u201cI believe that international recognition of a Palestinian state in the terms of the motion would make a two-state solution less likely rather than more likely. \u201cI don\u2019t see Israel, having faced the challenges it has over the years, caving in to this backbench motion. It might be a gesture on behalf of this house, but it would take the process no further.\u201d He said Hamas had \u201cset its face against any peace deal with Israel\u201d and undertaken a \u201ccampaign of terror\u201d. The motion had been tabled by Labour\u2019s Grahame Morris, who said it was right to take the \u201csmall but symbolically important\u201d step of recognising the Palestinian right to statehood. Tobias Ellwood, the Middle East minister, said the UK government was a \u201cstaunch supporter\u201d of Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, but settlement-building made \u201cit hard for Israel\u2019s friends to make the case that Israel is committed to peace\u201d. Ellwood said Palestinian statehood could only become a reality when occupation ends and stressed that the UK believes \u201cthis will only come through negotiations\u201d. He added: \u201cThe UK will bilaterally recognise a Palestinian state when we judge that it can best help bring about peace.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
