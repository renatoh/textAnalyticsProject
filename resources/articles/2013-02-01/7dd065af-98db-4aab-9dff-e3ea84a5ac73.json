It didn't make for the most heartfelt drama, but Brooker has the knack of keeping his abrasive ideas \u2013 some satiric and baleful, others mischievously viable \u2013 spinning in the air. The opening scenes were impatient to get the preliminaries out of the way. Here was a tousled pair of twentysomethings moving into a new house, their repartee (familiar from Brooker's guide to comedic hyperbole) unreasonably witty as Martha made soup while her silver-tongued Irishman, Ash, glued himself to Facebook and Twitter. At night they snuggled down to a bout of comfortably misfiring sex, as must all ideally matched couples who have evolved from being wild things to being in love. With so groovy a relationship it was hard to muster any surprise when Ash killed himself driving the hire van back to its owners. There were tears, of course \u2013 and Martha (Hayley Atwell) shed them with convincing rawness \u2013 but now came Brooker's meat and potatoes. Imagine a commercially available suite of predictive software \u2013 perhaps not today but not inconceivably the day after tomorrow \u2013 that could knit together a dead boyfriend's personality from the strands of his uploaded life: every tweet and message, every picture, voicemail and video, every link, like and favourite \u2013 the whole online him. Ingenious! (Fans, though, may have detected faint echoes of Jesse Armstrong's The Entire History of You from the last series \u2013 whose film rights have just been bought by Robert Downey Jr.) \"It's sick,\" Martha snapped when a friend gave her the nod about this experimental \"service\", but that was before the first email pinged in with a jaunty greeting from the deceased. The system smartened, spread, and soon he was on the phone, or at least his voice was \u2013 a new Ash blown in from the ashes of old conversations. Martha, frowning with joy, marvelled at his authenticity, but there was another level of wonder as Ash \u2013 turning telesales agent for an ambiguous moment \u2013 schmoozed her into going for the deluxe package. A crate of loosely assembled body parts duly arrived. \"It's blank till you activate it,\" he said, still purring on the phone while Martha hoisted his synthetic corporeal second self into the bath and added a sachet of chemicals. Things were good until they weren't. While the new Ash could be a pleasure (instant erections came as standard), he didn't eat or sleep. He was too well-behaved and, as you might have predicted, predictable. Frankly he had become a bit of a creep, standing around like a spare part while Martha was trying to work. But what now? One sensed Brooker scratching his head. The wheeze was clever, but over before quite getting to grips with its moral dimension and dramatic possibilities, leaving us instead with a flurry of false notes (the final \"resolution\" looked like it had been arrived at with the toss of a coin) and the conclusion that some women are never satisfied. I expected something sweary and violent from Sky Atlantic's new crime drama Vegas \u2013 set in 1960 and co-created by Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote Goodfellas and Casino \u2013 but I didn't even see anyone smoking. Dennis Quaid (cowboy hat, lasso) punched a few noses as Ralph Lamb, a tough, laconic rancher turned detective investigating the case of a girl found dead in the desert, with Michael Chiklis (the meaty bald guy from The Shield) playing murderous-but-fair Vincent Savino, a new mobster in town. But it was a strangely old-fashioned entertainment, reminiscent of that golden era of 1970s American shows (O Rockford Files, where art thou?) before Hill Street Blues came along with its puzzling multiple plotlines and newfangled way of having more than one person talking at the same time. Ralph's inquiry proceeded by hunch and grabbing people by the lapels. He gave little thought to the legality of looking through someone's private papers or throwing a white-suited lawyer into a cell. Naturally, he had an Indian tracker with a pigtail who knew a tyre mark when he saw one, and it was only a matter of time before Ralph was pursuing a Hells Angel down the Strip on his horse. 'You don't look like the law,\" croaked the Hells Angel. \"I've been hearing that,\" drawled Ralph, in an exchange that gave a fair measure of the writing. It could do with a few more laughs, but it was the kind of show you could easily see yourself enjoying if Britain ever goes back to having only three channels. With their synchronised waddling and pratfalls, penguins are the perfect vehicle for wildlife film-makers who think that nature can be improved by turning it into a Disney comedy. Penguins: Spy in the Huddle accordingly bubbled with goofy music and David Tennant, who had been hired to describe the cute, maladroit creatures as \"daring\" or \"irrepressible\" or \"feisty\". I agree they did seem to go out of their way to make things look difficult \u2013 no sooner scrambling out of the sea on to a ledge than being swept off again by a 20ft wave. But are we really to believe that the so-called rockhoppers of the South Atlantic scale dangerous cliffs to impress human bystanders with their sense of adventure? You might as well argue that dogs are brave for urinating against pylons or chasing sticks into rivers. Anyway, he was at it again in the Antarctic, pointing up the \"challenge\" of ice and blizzards. \"One false move,\" warned David, \"and it could all go horribly wrong.\" Somewhere in a parallel universe I can imagine emperor penguins making a documentary about humans having to cross roads and sharpen pencils. I could go on. My favourite \"peril\" involved the Humboldt penguins of Peru, which had to run a \"gauntlet\" of fat sea lions that were no more equipped for pouncing than our flippered friends were for playing Buckaroo. As far as I could see, no animals were hurt during the making of this film, though one of the robot penguins did almost get shagged by a short-sighted male. You had to laugh at that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
