The resolution urges Iran \"to re-establish full suspension of all enrichment related activities\", indicating western fears that Iran could be intent on producing atomic weapons. Tehran has always maintained it was restarting the enrichment programme to produce fuel. The resolution, drawn up by Britain, France and Germany, says that \"outstanding issues relating to Iran's nuclear programme have yet to be resolved, and that the agency is not yet in a position to conclude that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran\". However, the resolution noted that, in 2004, the IAEA found that \"all the declared nuclear material in Iran had been accounted for, and that such material had not been diverted to prohibited activities\". Tehran rejected the EU resolution today as illegal. \"The EU's resolution is unacceptable and we reject it,\" said Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation. \"Iran does not accept the resolution as it is not legal and also it is against the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),\" he said. An emergency meeting of the IAEA's board of governors began on Tuesday after Iran began some uranium enrichment activities at its conversion plant in the southern city of Isfahan the previous day. Yesterday, IAEA inspectors in Isfahan confirmed that Iran had broken UN seals - which were put in place last November - and had begun full operations at the facility. The resolution asks Iran to resume the suspension of its uranium enrichment programme and to permit the director general of the UN's nuclear watchdog to reinstate the broken seals. It also asks the head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, \"to provide a comprehensive report on the implementation of Iran's NPT safeguards agreement and this resolution by September 3 2005\". But the resolution does not mention referring Iran to the UN security council, which has the power to impose sanctions, and adds that there is still a chance the situation could be resolved with further negotiations. Gregory Schulte, the US envoy to the IAEA, said the adoption of the resolution \"shows that the international community is united in its determination that Iran move off the dangerous course that it is on\". Tehran rejected the latest package of economic and political incentives offered by the three EU countries at the weekend, describing it as \"insulting and humiliating\". Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, called on Tehran to continue discussions with the three EU countries - known as the EU3 - urging all parties not to take any action that would result in a further escalation of tensions. EU diplomats told Reuters that if Tehran did not comply with the draft resolution, they would call for it to be referred to the security council in September. Iran suspended its uranium enrichment programme last November under an agreement with the EU3. The deal was intended to persuade Tehran to end its enrichment programme and instead use imported low-enriched nuclear fuel for its reactors. Iran's suspension of the programme followed pressure from western nations after it was revealed that the country had been secretly developing a nuclear programme over the past 20 years. Tehran says it has resumed enrichment to produce fuel for nuclear power stations needed to meet the growing demand for electricity. Low-level enriched uranium is used to produce energy, but uranium that has been further enriched can be used to produce atomic weapons. Mr ElBaradei has warned against a proliferation of enrichment processes, saying that it \"brings us very close to the capability to develop nuclear weapons\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
