The front pair were together for their first full game since Burchill's \u00a3600,000 move from Celtic last week. \"I've wanted to sign Mark for a while and was delighted to finally get him,\" said Rix. \"They are two very different players but they've shown what they can do against Grimsby and I'm looking forward to seeing them play together for the rest of the season.\" Burchill began with a diving near-post header and scored the crucial third seven minutes after the Grimsby midfielder Meno Willems had been dismissed for a second caution. Crouch converted a Prosinecki cross for his first after Danny Butterfield had equalised. The substitute Michael Jeffrey's goal saw Grimsby draw level again but Burchill and Crouch, the lanky former Tottenham trainee signed from Queens Park Rangers, struck with two goals in a minute to take all three points. Portsmouth: Tardif; Buxton, Hiley, Zamperini (Crowe, 57min), Pitt, Barrett (Bradbury, 89), Prosinecki, Quashie, Harper (O'Neil, 88), Burchill, Crouch.
