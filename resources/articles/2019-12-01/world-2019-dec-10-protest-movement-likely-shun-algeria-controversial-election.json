The Hirak opposition movement, which emerged this year from weekly demonstrations against the former French colony\u2019s political establishment, has said the poll cannot be considered free or fair while the ruling elite, including the military, stay in power. All five candidates have close links with the establishment, leading many Algerians to see Thursday\u2019s election as part of a strategy to avoid genuine change. \u201cThe elections have no legitimacy whatsoever, they seem more like a comedy show than anything else. We want a transition, a real one, with people who have no ties with the old regime,\u201d said Yasmine Bouchene, a 29-year-old protester and member of Les Jeunes Engag\u00e9s activist collective. A vast crowd rallied in Algiers, the capital, on Friday chanting \u201cNo to voting, we swear we will not stop!\u201d and \u201cNo retreat\u201d. Marches took place across the country, including in the major cities of Oran and Constantine. Two of the approved candidates served as prime ministers to the former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was forced to step down after 20 years in power following huge demonstrations in April. In a televised debate on Friday \u2013 the first such broadcast event in Algeria\u2019s history \u2013 the five faced 13 questions, mainly on the country\u2019s political, economic and social situation. The army and the National Liberation Front (FLN), the party that won independence from France in 1962 and has ruled ever since, have pledged the vote will be free. Hirak\u2019s opposition to the election means the turnout on Thursday will be crucial \u2013 with the army and ruling establishment hoping for enough participation to ensure the legitimacy of a new president who can move to end protest. Demonstrators say no vote should take place until after sweeping changes. Zellag Lamine, 33, who works for a national telecommunications company and has taken part in the protests since February, said he had yet to decide if he would cast his vote. \u201cLike every Algerian, I want a country that respects rights. We need to put pressure on those in charge to solve the real problems in this country,\u201d he said. Algeria began a high-profile corruption trial of senior officials last week. James McDougall, a history professor at Oxford University and author of a book on the history of Algeria, said the move was aimed at boosting the credibility of the government\u2019s pledges to tackle corruption. \u201cThere has been a bit of a shift. But [those in power] think they can win the war of attrition between the system and the movement \u2026 If they can pin these guys as the gang [responsible for corruption] then that will appease a certain amount of popular anger,\u201d he said. Endemic graft was one issue that prompted protesters on to the streets of Algerian cities and towns in late February when it became clear that Bouteflika, 82, would seek a fifth term in power. The youngest of the five candidates is 56, while the majority of Algeria\u2019s population are under 30 years old. The candidates have been described by western diplomats in Algiers as \u201cthe softest version of Bouteflika\u2019s system\u201d. \u201cThe central demand of protesters since the fall of Bouteflika has been for a change in the system, so as to ensure that the same people are not holding the ropes. However, the only reforms have been surface deep,\u201d said Chloe Teevan, an analyst at the Brussels-based European Centre for Development Policy Management. The candidates have struggled to campaign, with hostile crowds gathering outside poorly attended rallies in heavily guarded venues. Election posters have been torn down. Authorities have intensified pressure on the protest movement in recent months, prosecuting some prominent leaders and detaining more than 150, including journalists, labour activists and a critical cartoonist. \u201cThe regime put in jail any person from the Hirak who got too big, which proved that there was never going to be a real transition or transparency by doing things on their terms,\u201d Bouchene said. The international NGO Human Rights Watch said scores of protesters had been arrested since September, most detained on spurious charges such as \u201charming national unity\u201d. The authorities\u2019 rhetoric has hardened as the poll has neared. Since Bouteflika stepped down, the army chief, Ahmed Gaid Salah, has emerged as the country\u2019s de facto ruler. Salah has described opponents of the election as \u201ca criminal gang ... full of bitterness and visceral hate for this country\u201d, and said he had ordered security forces to stop any planned disturbances of the poll. \u201cWe once more warn \u2026 anyone tempted to \u2026 try to prevent citizens exercising their constitutional rights that they will face justice and every power of the state,\u201d Salah said in a speech last week. Tensions within the protest movement may help the authorities. McDougall said the nature of demonstrations had changed in recent months, becoming less festive and creative and attracting older protesters, including more Islamists. \u201cThere is some evidence of fragmentation. The [political establishment] hope to get through the next few months, or year, and wait for the protest movement to peter out,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
