The operation and its sister site, Onefootball.com, has closed with the loss of more than 30 jobs. The two companies were placed into liquidation on Friday afternoon by their parent company, Sportsio. All the staff were made redundant immediately. Umbro manufactures the England kit as well as dozens of others including those for the Republic of Ireland, Chelsea and Celtic. The company also sponsors several star players, such as Liverpool's Michael Owen and Celtic's Henrik Larsson. Umbro.com, which was launched in July 2000, supplied football news and features and acted as an e-commerce site for the manufacturer. Sportsio operated the website for Umbro under a revenue share agreement. Onefootball.com became part of the group in 2001 when Sportsio acquired its parent company, One Sport. Onefootball.com, one of a rash of sports sites to launch during the dotcom boom, was by then already over \u00a34m in debt, but the acquisition deal was structured so that Sportsio was not required to take on those liabilities. It prided itself on its in-depth statistics and worldwide news, written by a network of more than 100 correspondents around the globe. But the downturn in online advertising and sheer weight of competition appears to have sealed its fate. In the past year, almost every independently backed sports site has closed or run into financial difficulties. Sportal and Sports.com, which were once worth a combined total of over \u00a3300m and employed more than 300 people, have collapsed. The Chrysalis backed site Rivals.net and the 365 network of sites were forced to merge last year. Paul Mather, a partner at corporate recovery specialists Kroll Buchler Phillips, has been put in charge of Umbro.com and Onefootball.com while they are in liquidation. No one from Sportsio, which will continue to trade for the time being, was available for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
