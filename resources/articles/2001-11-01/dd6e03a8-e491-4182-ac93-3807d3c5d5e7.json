Emerging from the Long-Range Desert Group of the second world war, it is an elite of about 240 extraordinarily fit, resourceful, specialist soldiers whose skills range from speaking local dialects to explosives to midwifery. Recruits are drawn from other army units, but only one applicant in 20 passes the gruelling four-week selection process. Pay SAS soldiers' pay ranges from less than \u00a325,000 a year to around \u00a380,000, depending on their skills and rank. This compares with a basic \u00a313,000 for privates in other regiments. SAS troops received little more than other soldiers until 1980 when their pay was suddenly made the best in the army after a drain of troops to the private sector. Pension The armed forces' non-contributory pension scheme provides handsome returns: 32% of 'representative pay' for a soldier's rank on retirement after 22 years' service. This rises to 48.5% after 37 years. Perks The best financial perk is probably the level of salary on offer to former SAS men in the private sector. Experts in explosives, the arms trade and personal security can easily earn well over \u00a3100,000 a year. But SAS members are not particularly motivated by money. Far more important is the fact that they are allowed to think for themselves in a bottom-up management structure where the best man for the job takes control in any troop, even if he is the youngest and lowest in rank. Leadership passes to a team's specialist navigator in difficult terrain, for instance. 'You do feel you can make a difference,' says Ken Connor, author of Ghost Force: the Secret History of the SAS and a veteran of numerous campaigns. 'And you are working with some brilliant people.' Disadvantages If you want to live to be 90, the SAS is not the place for you. Even in the 50s campaign against rebels in the former Malaya and its first campaigns, members who survived the day-to-day perils often suffered the long-term effects of starvation diets, bad quality water and infectious diseases. Nowadays, the hazards may be different but SAS men (and they are all men) regularly die in combat or in practice. Parachuting is particularly dangerous. There is a large plot of graveyards in St Martin's church, near the regimental HQ in Hereford, for men who died in service. Family life is badly harmed because soldiers must be away from home for months on end. The future The Middle East may become the main sphere of operations now that Northern Ireland appears to be quietening down. The events of September 11 will lead to a greater emphasis on preventing terrorism, Connor believes. 'Counter-terrorist forces are going to have to be proactive, not reactive.' Instead of calling in the SAS to release hostages and end hijackings, the emphasis may move to spotting potential danger and preventing it. My view: Gaz Hunter 'A bit of a loner', the son of an SAS man, a boy who 'enjoyed fieldcraft [and] hunting animals or other boys', Gaz Hunter was an SAS natural. From his book The Shooting Gallery (Orion, \u00a36.99) it is clear his fascination for difficult situations far outweighs his sense of fear - even when, as a freelance, he became the first man to take Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan in 1985. If caught he would have been treated like captured Soviet soldiers he saw being hacked apart. Highlights of his 20-year SAS career include monitoring the 1993 Waco siege in Texas, training Colombian drugs police and stints in Northern Ireland. Hunter, who retired three years ago at 41, was part of a 'new wave' that made the SAS hi-tech and outward-looking. 'It still wasn't perfect. But it was the best in the world,' he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
