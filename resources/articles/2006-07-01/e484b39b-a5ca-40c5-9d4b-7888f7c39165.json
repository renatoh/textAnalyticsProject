While many players and caddies were settling down to watch England's World Cup quarter-final against Portugal, the 2005 US Open champion was still out on the course. Leading the tournament by three at 12 under with two to play, he carved his drive over the exhibition tents and out of bounds to the right. Playing three off the tee, Campbell was also wildly right, but this time it bounced back off the tents and onto a path - where a passing spectator kicked it twice. Campbell took another tee shot, his fifth, and pulled that into the rough. After discussion with officials, who wanted to review television footage before making a ruling about whether his ball would have gone out of bounds, it was decided he should play both balls. He was eventually credited with a triple-bogey seven but he recovered superbly with a 25-foot birdie at the last to post a round of 68 and a 10-under total. He had earlier driven out of bounds at the 450-yard seventh to make double bogey - the only other blip in a round of eight birdies. That put him a stroke ahead of England's John Bickerton, leader for the previous two days, who carded a level-par 71 to remain on nine under."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
