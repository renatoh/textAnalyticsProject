On Thursday the Law Enforcement and Conduct Commission released the findings from a series of investigations into individual officer conduct as well as wider systematic issues in the police force. They included finding that two officers engaged in serious misconduct after they racially abused and belittled two Afghan women at a traffic stop and the revelation that police had mismanaged the child sex offender register for almost two decades, resulting in more than 700 incorrect decisions. At the same time, the commissioner of the LECC, Michael Adams QC, has revealed that the state of the watchdog\u2019s budget means it was only able to fully investigate 2% of the more than 2,547 complaints it began an initial assessment of. \u201cWe are, so to speak, drinking from a firehose,\u201d Adams wrote in the forward of the commission\u2019s annual report. Adams revealed that the previous 3% cut to the organisation\u2019s budget had been increased to 5% for the next four years. It means the commission will be forced to find another $6m in budget cuts over the next four years. \u201cOur budget position is challenging,\u201d he wrote in the report. \u201cLike most other public service organisations, we are consistently required to do more with less.\u201d The report reveals that the LECC began an assessment into 2,547 complaints in 2018-19, compared to 1,464 complaints received by the former Police Integrity Commission in 2015-16. In total, it conducted only 49 full investigations in the last financial year. As of June, it had 103 \u201congoing investigations\u201d including allegations of money laundering against a senior NSW police officer with financial associations to a criminal entity, allegations of \u201cexcessive and invasive bail compliance checks\u201d and a number of potentially illegal strip searches. Last month, the LECC held public hearings for its investigation into the allegedly illegal search of a 16-year-old girl at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass music festival. During the inquiry, a senior constable admitted that all 19 strip searches he performed at the festival may have been illegal.

Another investigation involves allegations of the unlawful strip searching of protesters in police custody, and an allegation of a sexual assault during a strip search at a Sydney police station. While no evidence of a sexual assault was uncovered, \u201cnumerous breaches ... were indicated including the use of force to effect a strip search\u201d. It is not the first time Adams has spoken out about the NSW government\u2019s funding of the organisation. Last year, he wrote that since the LECC was established in 2017 to replace the Police Integrity Commission, the ombudsman and the NSW Crime Commission it had been forced to take on a \u201cfar broader\u201d jurisdiction than its predecessors while operating with a smaller budget and many fewer staff. At the time, Adams wrote the agency had been forced to make make \u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201carbitrary\u201d decisions about whether to investigate allegations of serious misconduct by police, and revealed the agency had ignored more than 50 integrity complaints that \u201cwarranted investigation\u201d. Adams, a former NSW supreme court judge, said the higher rate of required savings would \u201csadly\u201d hamper the commission\u2019s ability to do its job. \u201cThis will continue to impact the number of serious misconduct complaints we are able to investigate, research projects that we undertake and NSW police force misconduct investigations that we oversee,\u201d he wrote in the report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
