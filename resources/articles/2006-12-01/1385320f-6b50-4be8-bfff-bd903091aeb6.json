I'm pleased to report the Masson-esque formula - if formula isn't too strong a word for such anarchic proceedings - is thriving in a show of cartoon-like boldness and energy. Written by Fletcher Mathers and directed by Gordon Dougall, Wullie Whittington might lack the most dazzling of Masson's word games, but it manages to subvert and celebrate panto with as much elan as ever. Played out on Kenny Miller's sets of retro-punk pink and chequerboard Americana, the show takes us to the \"pantosphere\", where last year's understudy is making a bid for the leading role. The problem for Mark Prendergast's Wullie is that he can't hold a tune - unlike his second cousin twice removed, Dick Whittington, who is odds-on favourite to win the XY Factor talent show. Dick is that unfashionable thing, a principal boy - played by an excellent Claire Dargo - whose self-centredness turns him/her briefly into the baddie. Such flouting of convention is matched in a bizarre scene in which a sheep (also played by Dargo) comes out as a cat. It could be a recipe for postmodern disaster, but all the boy-meets-girl, good-versus-evil values are intact, give or take the odd unlikely turn of events. Alasdair McCrone's Fitzsporran is a bona fide baddie after an electric shock turns him into a rat-loving sewer monster. With Bob Carr as the most masculine of dames, lots of audience participation and good songs, the Tron continues to have its panto cake and eat it. \u00b7 Until January 7.
