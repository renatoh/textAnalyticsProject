But don't imagine this is going to be an easy political operation. Nicely Nicely Johnson talks human, not human resources, but he's up against voters' love of doctors and distrust of politicians. Gordon Brown puts reclaiming the NHS top of his emergency list. The 1.3 million rumbling and rebellious staff tell their patients the health service is doomed, strangled by red tape and going to the dogs. They always did, but it's got much worse. Doctors win trust from their patients with us-against-the-system grumbles about NHS \"bureaucracy\". GPs can be politically lethal: no other profession meets 600,000 voters one-to-one every day. So the doctors must be wooed. A succession of ideological and cavalier reforms from Blair's macho Labour health ministers, Milburn and Reid, has often thrown the NHS into needless and ill-thought-out turmoil over the last decade. At least four major structural \"reforms\" obliged staff to re-apply for their old jobs under new brassplates, losing some six months' productive work each time. Failure to listen to doctors' advice leads often to worse decisions. So they have justification for complaint, and Brown and Johnson know it. Recently, for the first time in history, voters told pollsters they thought the Tories would be better for the NHS than Labour. The Tory party website opens with a banner flashing \"Brown's Health Cuts\". In a Commons debate on Tuesday, a battery of Tory MPs from the shires led the charge against 60 threatened closures, or \"reconfigurations\", in their areas. Although the Brown bounce already has voters telling pollster ICM that they give the NHS back to Labour, and Mori finds pessimism about the future of the NHS halved in the last month, Labour has much to do yet. Johnson's opening spoonful of sugar went down well. He promised a review by a respected surgeon turned health minister, Ara Darzi, designed to prescribe remedies for staff discontent. Fewer targets from the top, and absolutely no more structural changes to primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities, brought sighs of relief all round. The perpetually \"rock-bottom morale\" BMA sends out politically hostile press releases on a daily basis, but its first grudging response was not too bad. Never forget, says Labour GP and MP Howard Stoate, that doctors are intrinsically Tory: they vote 70% Tory, 20% Lib Dem and only 10% Labour. None the less, Alan Johnson must pacify them as best he can. But here are the problems: he needs to win over both patients and doctors, but their interests are often in conflict. Patients want to make appointments easily and see GPs at weekends and evenings but GPs won't do it, or not without \u00a3350m more, although they are already the best paid in the world. Doctors' and patients' interests are not the same when the All Party Pharmacy Group suggests saving patients much trouble by letting chemists do routine repeat prescribing, and blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol screening, plus treatment of minor illnesses. GP magazine warns, \"GPs may be losing quality framework work worth \u00a38,000 to community pharmacists,\" while GP negotiators said it would \"fragment care and be damaging to patients\". The public wants clean hospitals with kind nurses to bathe, feed and comfort the frail - but nurses often want to raise their professional status and leave that stuff to untrained, underpaid, often non-English-speaking transient assistants. NHS staff feel oppressed by targets, but without them patients would see no dramatic drop in hospital and A&amp;E waiting, or in ambulance response times. Without monitoring ordered from on high, patients wouldn't know C difficile and MRSA rates. That one is high on the priority list and Johnson has announced \u00a350m more for germ warfare. Are we sure that's where doctors and nurses would allocate extra cash? Politicians are elected to represent the people, so they fear letting go of money and control to professional interests, even if the people sometimes wrongly trust professionals more. That's the paradox Johnson confronts. But by steering the NHS about so recklessly, Labour has for now forfeited the right to tell the professionals what to do. Listening to them has become mandatory. Lucky Johnson has inherited finances in a better state than ever before in a traditionally debt-riddled system. Patricia Hewitt paid the price for driving out all but small pockets of debt so painfully fast, well before the next election. She has left the NHS on course to hit that eye-watering 18-week maximum waiting time target. She was already cutting back sharply on the second wave of private treatment centres, so let no one call this an old Labour retreat. Competition from the first wave did sharpen up NHS practice and private clinic prices, but there will only be a few more where extra capacity is needed. This private market issue will be the major dividing line with the Tories. Their policy is for competition on price between unlimited private and state hospitals, a free-for-all supermarket of care. It may be superficially attractive to voters, but the Tories will struggle to explain how it can work. If private hospitals are free to undercut and skim off easy operations, then NHS hospitals crippled with the cost of expensive, difficult work will rapidly go bankrupt and shut. How do the Tories square that with campaigns to keep every local NHS unit open? Closures are a problem for Labour but the decisions will be local: Johnson plans to refer the most contentious to an independent clinical panel. There are a hundred dilemmas ahead. The purchaser-provider market is weak, with the PCT commissioners too feeble to stop all their money being drained away from the community into all-powerful hospitals. The market has perverse incentives that need fixing. Some hospitals keen to pull in patients are banning consultants from giving GPs advice about a patient over the phone, ordering them to summon in the patient to earn the extra cash. A&amp;Es are now greedy for patients, so wise PCTs should station a senior GP at the door of every A&amp;E to divert a third of patients with minor problems, and save paying for needless hospital episodes. There is a new financial incentive for over-treatment. A third of cataract operations done by fast-track private and NHS clinics made no difference to patients' eyesight. NHS insiders fear inertia in the face of these hard problems. Don't use the deadly word \"reform\" - but none of this can stand still. However, right now Johnson has a year to save the NHS for Labour before the next election. What patients want is easy - kind, fast, clean, friendly, respectful treatment from staff who smile. What doctors and nurses want is harder - they want to run the show themselves. The plan is for local senior NHS managers to bring doctors into all decision-making so they can see the evidence and decide on their local targets. If managers treat them better - no more warfare - then doctors may stop treating managers as some impertinent lower order. As for the polls, the irony is that fickle public attitudes towards the NHS rise and fall with opinions on the government. If Brown does well, Johnson will too, rather than the other way round. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
