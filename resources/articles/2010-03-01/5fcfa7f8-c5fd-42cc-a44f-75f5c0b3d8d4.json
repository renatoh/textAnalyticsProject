Eurofighter Typhoons took off from the quick reaction alert base at Coningsby in Lincolnshire \u2013 one of two such bases in the UK \u2013 minutes after warnings of suspected attempts to hijack American airliners. Procedures were triggered that could ultimately lead to a decision to destroy the aircraft, to avoid mass casualties. That decision would be taken \"at the highest levels of government\", officials say. Though a decision would be taken by the prime minister, if he could not be contacted or was incapacitated, it would be taken by two other designated members of the cabinet, believed to be the home secretary and the transport secretary. Last Monday British air traffic control picked up the words \"hostage\" and \"ransom\" from a United Airlines plane bound for Frankfurt in Germany. The plane suddenly dropped height south of Reading in Berkshire and a request for the airliner's auxiliary power unit to be activated \u2013 a very unusual occurrence \u2013 was heard. The Typhoons from Coningsby approached the airliner over Manston airfield in Thanet, east Kent, a matter of minutes \u2013 the exact time is classified \u2013 after the alert was first sounded, according to officials familiar with the incident. In the other incident earlier this month, on 2 March, the crew of an American Airlines plane put out an alert, picked up by the air defence control and reporting centre at Boulmer in Northumberland, warning that somebody was trying to get into the cockpit. Pilots of the Typhoons at Coningsby and RAF Tornado F3 fighters at Leuchars in Fife \u2013 the UK's other quick reaction alert base \u2013 were immediately briefed and ordered to intercept the airliner. The Tornados were soon stood down but the Typhoons flew on until they were close enough to identify the airliner, whose exact position had been unclear. Armed police from Scotland Yard's counterterrorism command were alerted, as was No 10. The airliner's crew soon radioed that the incident was not a credible attempt to hijack the plane and the passenger was under control and under guard. Both incidents were false alarms. However, they show how emergency procedures, set up after the 9/11 attacks on the US, and refined in 2007, are activated. Alerts are picked up by radar stations at Boulmer and Scampton in Lincolnshire. They are then passed to the RAF's national air and space operations centre in High Wycombe. From there, 10 Downing Street is alerted, where officials are ready to warn the prime minister that he may have order an RAF pilot to shoot down a civilian airliner. It is potentially one of the most difficult decisions of a prime minister's tenure, perhaps second only to ordering the commander of a Trident submarine to launch a nuclear missile. There is a terrorism alert involving civil airliners in British airspace about once a month \u2013 out of some three million which cross it every year \u2013 officials say. Under interrogation at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and secret prisons, terrorist suspects have claimed al-Qaida planned to attack Canary Wharf in London's docklands and other UK targets. Government officials are wary of discussing details of the emergency procedures, saying that the exact time it has taken an RAF jet to reach airliners and what maneouvres the pilot takes up are classified."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
