Kate Ashbrook, chairman of the Ramblers' Association's access committee, who led the fight to reopen the path, made the first cut through the barbed wire surrounding the East Sussex estate before a digger began removing obstructions including old fridges. Van Hoogstraten, who is serving a 10-year term for the manslaughter of an associate, had become a symbol of the ramblers' battles with landlords who blocked paths and got away with it because local authorities were unwilling to stand up to them. He set up a company, Rarebargain Ltd, which owned the land where the obstructions were placed, and offered to divert the path. Lewes magistrates backed the ramblers and imposed \u00a386,000 in fines which Van Hoogstraten refused to pay, leading to the company's bankruptcy and yesterday's clearing of the path."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
