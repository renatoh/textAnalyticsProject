The study was led by the University of Sydney\u2019s associate professor Adam Dunn, who said despite growing concern about the influence of bots in spreading misinformation, they appeared to be ineffective when it came to influencing discourse around vaccines. Dunn said while many previous studies into bots examined the number of bots, and who was behind them, it was much more important to measure their impact.

Recommended reads When we woke on the first day of 2020, we knew this year was going to be different, but not quite like this. \u201cIt\u2019s been commonly remarked that the pandemic has starkly exposed the existing inequities in our societies,\u201d writes Alison Croggan. \u201cIt seems that every problem that has rumbled beneath our feet for the past 60 years has hit crisis point, all at once \u2026 Where do I begin?\u201d Misbehaving private schoolboys, the entire council for the Order of Australia and a travel agent who said Tracy Grimshaw should be \u201cgiven a firm uppercut\u201d are among the latest winners of the infamous Ernie awards, handed out for sexist conduct. This year\u2019s list has been singled out for their ability to sally forth, even in such unprecedented times, with unusually misogynistic and sexist remarks. Whether it\u2019s a gentle pinch of the tip, or a full-handed feel of the base, touching an avocado before you buy it is a commonplace grocery store habit. But Suzie Delroy, a second-generation farmer based just outside of Pemberton in southern Western Australia, says this homespun test is in fact a leading cause of bruising.

That took them to 18 in a row, setting a new record in the women\u2019s game. Now with three games against New Zealand from this Saturday, they have a shot at levelling the record for all ODIs. For Matt White, chief sports director of Australian cycling team Mitchelton-Scott, the Giro d\u2019Italia is more than just a bike race.

After coming agonisingly close to overall success in 2016 and 2018, Mitchelton-Scott heads to Italy this weekend hoping it proves third time lucky.
