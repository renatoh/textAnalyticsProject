Adlington was nearly 5sec down on her Olympics world record of 8min 14.10sec here last night, but her assessment that her first competitive 800m since Beijing was a \"solid start\" should not disguise the fact that her Ponds Forge time would still have been fast enough for gold in Beijing and that only Janet Evans, Kate Ziegler and Laure Manaudou have ever swum faster. \"I haven't really raced since Beijing,\" Adlington said. \"It's been a good week and I just want to push on now.\" Adlington, briefly, has been a national celebrity; that she remains an inspiration to a new generation of British women swimmers is undeniable. Prominent among them was Ellen Gandy, the baby of the Beijing squad, who upstaged Adlington last night with the third fastest swim in history in the 200m butterfly final. Only the Chinese duo Lui Zige and Jiao Liuyang, in the Beijing Water Cube, have swum faster, leaving Gandy a definite medal prospect for London 2012 after she smashed European, Commonwealth and British records. Due to a scoreboard malfunction, which failed to show correct split times, that European record might not be ratified. No matter; she has done the time. Britain's head coach, Dennis Pursley, leading the squad for the first time since his appointment after Beijing, had predicted that the stunning race between Adlington and Jo Jackson on the opening night, won by Jackson as both swimmers surpassed the old world record, would \"increase the belief\" among other team members. Gandy, still only 17, still needed some convincing, her hand clamped across her mouth in astonishment. Her 2min 4.83sec swim was nearly 3sec inside her personal best and leaves her only 0.67sec adrift of Liu Zige's world record. She had begun the meet with a British record over 100m butterfly, but this was something special. She looked as if she had no idea how she had done it, and unless the computer can churn out some split times, she may never entirely know. Although she still swims out of the Beckenham club, Gandy emigrated to Australia two years ago when her father took a job at Melbourne airport. Her mother and brother made the trip to watch her and as for her coach, the Australian Rohan Taylor, he was unlikely to get much of a lie-in. \"I want to call my coach,\" Gandy said. \"He will be asleep but I want to call him right now. I just did the process. I didn't think it was that fast. I'm in a state of shock. All I wanted was to make the team.\" Mansfield responded to Beijing by renaming a pub the Adlington Arms. What chance of her native Bromley following up less than four years from now with the Gandy Tavern?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
