The move came as Tony Blair and the Irish premier, Bertie Ahern, met party leaders at Hillsborough Castle in an attempt to end the deadlock in the Northern Ireland political process. However there was little hope last night of a significant breakthrough. The IRA revealed their representative had been in touch with decommissioning head, General John de Chastelain, to pave the way for more discussions, the first since last June. But republicans want further moves on policing reform, security scaled down and an amnesty to prisoners on the run, and the IRA warned: \"For this engagement to be successful, the British government must deliver on its obligations.\" While the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, welcomed the initiative as creating space for movement, the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, dismissed it as a publicity stunt, insisting he wanted action not words on decommissioning. Yesterday's round table and bilateral negotiations were described as \"full and frank\", and sources claimed the prime minister admitted, with caveats, the government had not yet delivered on all commitments made last May. The talks came after eight weeks of behind-the-scenes efforts to broker a deal, but with election pressures retrenching all sides, few were holding out hope of an immediate settlement on policing, decommissioning and demilitarisation. The aim now seems to be an interim arrangement, which will tide the parties through to summer or even autumn, avoiding the need for suspension of the power-sharing Stormont assembly, but have the new IRA statements given Mr Blair and Mr Ahern the opening gambit they need? The Provisional IRA is as aware as any paramilitary organisation of how to use surprise tactics to best advantage, and on one reading, as Mr Trimble was quick to point out, the latest moves could be viewed as merely a \"pre-emptive strike\", shifting blame before a possible collapse of the process. The IRA has promised to do no more than it did last May, when it opened up several of its secret arms dumps to two international inspectors, but no weapons were decommissioned. But on another level, the statements are a welcome reminder of the Provisionals' commitment to peace, and an antidote to IRA veteran Brian Keenan's ominous words a fortnight ago that violence was still an option if politics failed. There was a feeling, however, that Mr Keenan's speech was for internal consumption, showing would-be defectors to dissidents like the Real IRA that he has not gone soft, and the fact that he is the Provisionals' representative to the de Chastelain commission is significant, given the latest move. London and Dublin's hope is that the IRA reopening serious discussions with de Chastelain would enable Mr Trimble to lift his ban on Sinn Fein ministers Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun attending north/south meetings. The government would undertake some security scaledown, perhaps shutting installations in Magherafelt, Co Derry, and Newtownhamilton, Co Armagh, with the prospect of further closures of some of the controversial watchtowers in south Armagh. It is also hoped the SDLP at least could be persuaded to take its seats on the new police board, with the door still open for Sinn Fein to do so later. The SDLP has up till now refused to break ranks with Sinn Fein on policing. The SDLP recently appeared to be nearing a deal to enable it to nominate representatives to the police board but their big fear is jumping first on to the board and Sinn Fein then negotiating some further concessions, which would then enable them to gain capital in the election. Downing Street has strongly denied Sunday's Real IRA bomb outside the London headquarters of the BBC has increased pressure to make progress. But there is no doubt the growing dissident republican threat has added urgency to proving politics work, while conversely making it more difficult for unionists and republicans to compromise. Mr Adams will argue that to make radical moves on decommissioning would drive new recruits into the arms of the dissidents, but, in this context, the IRA statement is important as an indication of final intent. Mr Trimble, meanwhile, insists such attacks make demilitarisation dangerous and disarmament all the more necessary. He has made it clear he will not lift his veto for something inconsequential. The anti-agreement Ulster Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson has said his party needs to see actual decommissioning very soon. But the expected Ulster Unionist Council showdown at the start of the year never materialised and the im mediate threat of the party's pullout from Stormont seems to have somewhat receded. An Ulster Unionist meeting is scheduled for March 24, although foot and mouth restrictions might lead to its postponement, given that many key members are farmers, which could ironically buy Mr Trimble time. But the crux of the issue remains exactly what IRA re-engagement with de Chastelain constitutes, which will no doubt be teased out in coming days, and whether it will be enough to keep unionists on board. Mr Trimble is reluctant to see Stormont put into cold storage, although another review of the process with no suspension is still possible. And while this election is expected to be tough for his party, there is a contrary argument that its pressures could force members to paper over bitter divisions, at least for the time being. He might feel he can now afford to wait it out to see exactly what the IRA does, while they, likewise, will carefully assess reciprocal moves. Keen as Mr Blair is to see some sort of deal, rather than no deal at all, he may well have to be content with work in progress.
