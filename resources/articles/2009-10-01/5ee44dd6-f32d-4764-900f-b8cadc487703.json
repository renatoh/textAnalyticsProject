Paul Dixon, chairman of the Racehorse Owners' Association, reminded the government that a pledge had been made to pass half of the proceeds of any sale to the sport. His words followed the news last night that the Tote, which has a monopoly on pool betting, is to be sold as part of \u00a316bn sale of government assets in an attempt to restore stability to public finances. Gordon Brown is expected to announce the measures tomorrow, when other assets expected to be marked for disposal will include the Channel tunnel rail link. The news came out of the blue for the Tote chief executive, Trevor Beaumont, who offered no comment last night. Dixon, too, was taken aback. \"This news comes as a real surprise,\" he said, \"because racing has been working closely with the Tote for months and the possibility of this happening has never ever been mentioned. \"There was a deal done through Gerry Sutcliffe [the sports minister] and it was reiterated at that time that 50% of the proceeds of any sale would be given to racing. So, if the Tote is sold to an outside venture, one would hope the government would honour that.\" The Labour party has twice made a manifesto pledge to ensure the transfer of the Tote to a trust managed by racing. The former sports minister, Richard Caborn, admitted during a parliamentary debate last year that he had \"dropped a clanger\" in failing to ensure this had happened. Dixon pointed out that the government had twice turned down offers from racing consortia to buy the Tote. \"The original bid was over \u00a3400m, which was declined, and then there was a second offer of \u00a3320m after the market collapsed, which was also rejected,\" he said. \"I would think the government would be very red-faced if they accepted anything less than that. \"It seems a strange time, in terms of the economic cycle, to liquidate an asset, if you want to get full value. It seems a very desperate thing to do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
