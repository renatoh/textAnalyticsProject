It depicted a woman who turned the tables on a violent would-be rapist, tied him up and gave him a dose of his own medicine. Maggie Nevill's girls'-night-out play is supposedly a comic variation of this scenario with a group of women paying a man back because he has two-timed one of them. It is not so much girls behaving badly as girls behaving very sadly indeed. They are not furies but harpies. It is New Year's Eve and in the ladies' loo, is trying to cheer up recently dumped Sal. Then the door opens and Matt is bundled into a cubicle by his former girlfriend G, who is outraged by his infidelity. The price of his freedom is \u00a350 and two hours of our time. I was quite tempted to leap on stage and offer him the \u00a350 myself so we could all leave. Twenty years ago the girls-together truth-telling that ensues would have had some kind of consciousness-raising subtext. But Nevill's characters have all the consciousness of tapeworms; I doubt they could find it to raise it. They struggle under the misapprehension that a few pairs of tights will easily restrain a 14-stone man, when in my experience a pair of tights can't even restrain my legs for more than half an hour without laddering. I suppose we are expected to suspend all disbelief in the interests of comedy, and you might if it was remotely funny. But the evening gives the impression that the jokes were written first and the rest of the script written round them. The piece isn't inlaid with heavy-handed humour but overlaid. Not only do these women show no sign of a brain between them, they have no discernible characters either. The cast of capable actors flounder about like fish on bicycles in a production that seems intent on emphasising rather than minimising the play's deficiencies. Why is it playing at this theatre that has produced so many brilliant, honest plays about women's experience? We should lock Soho Theatre staff in the loo until they tell us. \u0095 Until August 10.
