In a move which will be seen as an attempt to give credit across the parties, the former Olympic champion will thank Tony Blair, Tessa Jowell, Ken Livingstone and Richard Caborn as he addresses Labour's autumn conference for the first time. He will be joined by Paul Deighton, the chief executive of London 2012 who is due to take up an advisory role to George Osborne in the Treasury in January. The two main parties have tussled over the right to claim responsibility for the legacy of the hugely successful Games. Labour was in power when the bid was won, but the coalition drew international praise for first class facilities and organisation. Coe will say: \"I am delighted to be at the Labour party conference to put on record my personal thanks to Tessa Jowell, Tony Blair, Ken Livingstone, Richard Caborn and countless others that have made the Olympic and Paralympic Games the success they were. Their foresight and energy in supporting and driving forward the bid and the infrastructure budget was unparalleled.\" The morning session will be chaired by the former triple jump Olympic champion Jonathan Edwards and will include a number of Olympic and Paralympic medallists including the winner of the first ever women's Olympic boxing gold, Nicola Adams. Tessa Jowell, the former shadow Olympics minister, will say the government is damaging future Olympic hopes by selling off school sports fields. \"The dismantling by this education secretary of world class organisation for PE and sport in schools is beyond belief,\" she will say, before claiming that the summer has reawakened a form of progressive nationalism in the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
