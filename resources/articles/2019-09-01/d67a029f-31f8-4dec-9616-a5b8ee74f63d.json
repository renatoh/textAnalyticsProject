Another derby ended in another draw, allowing Real Madrid to remain top and Atl\u00e9tico to remain a solitary point behind them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have clear chances and nor did they: neither of us risked very much,\u201d Jan Oblak said at the final whistle, pretty much saying it all. Between them, these sides spent almost \u20ac600m in the summer but they produced a game of few clear-cut opportunities that came to a goalless conclusion. The last time these teams had met, it had finished 7-2 to Atl\u00e9tico in New Jersey. \u201cWhat happened, happened,\u201d Zidane had said then. Everyone knew it would be different this time and so it turned out. This was tighter, tenser, and meant more; a fact highlighted by the inclusion of Fede Valverde in Real\u2019s midfield in place of James Rodr\u00edguez. Afterwards Zidane suggested that defensive solidity was his priority. This was a battle for control which no one really won \u2013 at least not when it came to the ball \u2013 but no one lost either. If there was a broad first-half pattern it ran: Atl\u00e9tico, Real, Atl\u00e9tico. Joao Felix shot wide when Diego Costa sent him clear. Harmless shots from Karim Benzema, Nacho and Toni Kroos drew three corners in little over a minute. Kroos then took the ball beautifully on the bounce before bending a shot from 20 yards that Jan Oblak dived to push away. There was little, though, from the two biggest signings: Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix and Eden Hazard. Thomas Partey was the game\u2019s outstanding midfielder. Displaying a range of passing that was not always reciprocated by those around him, he sent a superb ball across the six-yard box which Costa couldn\u2019t reach. Kieran Trippier was another of the night\u2019s most impressive performers, sought early and often by his team-mates. Thomas teed up Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix to shoot wide from the edge of the area and then his superb pass found Trippier in the area. Options didn\u2019t open up for the Englishman with the speed he hoped and Thibaut Courtois stopped his low ball reaching Koke. Diego Simeone made his first change at the break, \u00c1ngel Correa replacing Vitolo and immediately dashing in to head over from Costa\u2019s chipped pass. Correa brought electricity but not much clarity and it was Real who had the clearest chance of the night when Hazard found Nacho overlapping. Nacho\u2019s cutback ran towards Gareth Bale, thundering into the area and the perfect shooting position. He opened his body and hit the ball high into the south end, the roar from the fans there speaking of relief. At the other end, Trippier\u2019s cross \u2013 his ninth \u2013 only just evaded Costa. Both sides made changes, albeit without running excessive risks. Lemar, Modri\u0107, Llorente and James were introduced but it had little affect on the direction of the game, something both teams seemed to accept and embrace as time ticked away. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to go mad, throwing everything forward,\u201d Courtois said. Sa\u00fal headed Koke\u2019s corner just past the post. Thomas, Correa and Trippier combined to reach the byline but Koke couldn\u2019t turn the shot goalwards at the near post. And that was just about that, Zidane not unjustly saying: \u201cWe didn\u2019t allow a single chance.\u201d The closest anyone came was Benzema, whose header from Nacho\u2019s cross found Oblak diving full length to make a sharp save."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
