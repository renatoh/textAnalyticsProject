Carl Jacobsen, the son of J.C. Jacobsen, the founder of the dynasty, was a voracious collector of art. His New Carlsberg Foundation funded the Glyptotek museum in Copenhagen that celebrates art down the centuries. The brewery he ran side by side with his father's plant not only has statues and art work in abundance but is a magnificent example of nineteenth-century industrial architecture. You enter the site through an imposing elephant gate modelled on the Minerva Square obelisk in Rome. A model of Thor, the god of thunder, rides his chariot on the roof while a second arched entrance beyond the elephant gate is surmounted by portraits of members of the Jacobsen family and key brewery employees. J.C. Jacobsen's original brewery - Gamle or Old Carlsberg - is now a brewery museum that offers a fascinating portrait of brewing during the industrial revolution when beer-making was transformed by steam power and refrigeration. Jacobsen's father was one of many small brewers in Copenhagen who made beers belonging to the ale family. When J.C. heard of the new style 'Bavarian beers' being made in Munich by cold fermentation and ageing (lagering) at low temperatures, he was determined to follow suit. He made the long and arduous journey by coach to Munich and returned with a pot of lager yeast in his hat box. At every stop, he doused the pot in cold water to keep the yeast cool. Back home, he used his mother's wash tub - on display in the brewery - to experiment with making the new style of beer. When his mother died, he used his inheritance to build a new brewery at Valby on the outskirts of Copenhagen. It had a constant supply of pure spring water and stood on a hill or berg in which he dug deep lager cellars. He named it after his son and Carl's brewery on a hill - Carlsberg - was born. The Bavarian beer appeared in November 1847 and was an instant success. J.C. encouraged Carl to tour the great breweries of Europe, including Britain, to learn brewing skills and eventually he opened his Ny or New Carlsberg brewery. In the manner of great dynasties, J.C. and Carl fell out spectacularly. Carl built a wall between the two sites and father and son did not speak for years, though they were reconciled shortly before J.C. died. J.C. Jacobsen pioneered a greater scientific understanding of brewing. While most other brewers worked empirically, judging temperatures by eye and the levels of steam rising from their vats, Jacobsen created the Carlsberg Laboratory. Inspired by the work of Pasteur, Jacobsen equipped the laboratory with microscopes and other instruments to enable him to understand the mysteries of fermentation. The work proved vital. As great industrial cities sprang up all over Europe and Scandinavia, workers demanded quality beer on a regular basis. Until the mid-nineteenth century, brewing was a seasonal affair, impossible to carry out in summer because of the risk of infection from heat and bacteria. When brewers attempted to make beer in summer they found their brews went sour. In the Carlsberg Laboratory, Jacobsen's chief scientist, Emil Hansen, used a microscope to discover that brewer's yeast was made up of dozens of different competing cells. Some were bad cells that lay dormant in cold weather but sprang to life in summer. Hansen managed to isolate one pure cell of yeast. By mixing it with a sugary solution, he produced more yeast that was then stored in a 'yeast bank'. It was offered to Jacobsen's main rival, Tuborg when its beer was infected, and even to his disaffected son's company. Eventually, Carlsberg's yeast was made available world-wide. It transformed brewing and was given the scien tific name of saccharomyces carlsbergensis , the basis of all lager brewing today. The story of Carlsberg comes to life in the museum. The original kilns where barley was turned into malt, and the tuns, coppers and lagering vessels that produced beer are all in place, along with primitive early bottling lines and the machine in which Hansen isolated his pure strain of yeast. The museum also illustrates the back-breaking and repetitive nature of work in the last century. Models show women on the bottling lines and men turning barley in kilns, digging used grain from tuns, drinking their daily ration of beer and reading socialist newspapers during their breaks. In the stables, horses are groomed in preparation for pulling ancient delivery carts. At the end of the tour visitors can enjoy a beer in a bar alongside the stables. This is arguably the most revealing aspect of the tour for Carlsberg (long ago merged with Tuborg) produces a large range of beers that have rather more character than the thin lager made in Britain in the group's Northampton brewery. It still produces a brown lager in the Bavarian style that encouraged Jacobsen to build his first brewery. Stronger Carlsberg and Tuborg beers, such as Carlsberg Elephant, have rich aromas and flavours, while Carlsberg Porter Stout is jet black and has a complex molasses and scorched malt character. In the warren of lagering cellars beneath the two breweries Carlsberg has launched a scheme to increase the appreciation of beer in Denmark. A small pilot brewery, capable of producing 1,000 litres of beer at a time, makes special beers under the label of Semper Ardens, the Latin for Always Burning, the brewery's motto that encourages constant innovation. To date, the Semper Ardens plant has produced an Abbey Ale modelled on the Belgian style first made by monks, a fruit beer made with cherries with Belgium again as the inspiration, and a rich and powerful Criollo Stout made with rye malt and the addition of two types of chocolate. A wheat beer will follow early this year. The beers are made available to 300 top restaurants in Denmark where the chefs are encouraged to design dishes to accompany the beer. The tart and slightly astringent Cerise cherry beer, for example, goes well with pickled herring dishes while Criollo Stout makes a marvellous dessert beer.
