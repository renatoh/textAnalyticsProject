But there will be no respite for the England players in training, with Eddie Jones demanding improvements. England\u2019s next match is at home to Italy in two weeks, and Jones said he will make changes against a side who have lost their opening two matches and conceded 63 points at home to Ireland on Saturday. \u201cIt was a great Test. I never thought we were going to lose but I think we have used up all our get out of jail free cards,\u201d said Jones, who the week before had seen his side come from behind to defeat France at Twickenham. \u201cI thought we were very good in the first 20 minutes and the last 20, but we were indifferent in the middle 40 and we need to improve our consistency. \u201cI have some ideas of how we want to play against Italy. We have never lost to Italy, and while we will need to prepare well it is a great chance to do something different so there could be changes. That said, I am happy with the guys today. They showed grit and we are becoming a side that is hard to beat. There were moments today when I thought we were going to fade out, but we kept hanging in there and making tackles. \u201cWe have a training camp in central London in the week and the players will be working hard. We had a young team against a Wales team that played as well as I have seen. It was a proper Test match and we will learn from it having been a bit over-eager in the first 20 minutes.\u201d The match was played with the roof open on a cold but dry evening in the Welsh capital because Jones had refused to agree to Wales\u2019s request for it to be closed. He strung them along all week, revealing after the match that he had no intention of playing under cover. \u201cI cannot believe the things that went on about the roof,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be open unless conditions are terrible because that is how rugby should be played. The crowd played its part in making it a great Test match, giving us stick the whole game, and the ground reminds me of Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.\u201d England\u2019s next two matches are at home to Italy and Scotland. If they win both they will equal New Zealand\u2019s record of 18 straight Test victories with a trip to Dublin to face Ireland to come at the end of the Six Nations. \u201cThis was the best win of the 16,\u201d said Daly, whose try with four minutes left was decisive. \u201cWe all came together in the final 10 minutes and knew what we needed to do. We were calm and direct and secured the victory. I just had to pin my ears back for the try and go for the corner, luckily sneaking in. \u201cEddie has given us belief and the players have responded, taking massive ownership this week, driving by Dylan Hartley and Owen Farrell. That showed by scoring a try in the 76th minute having defended a number of phases in our 22. Wales were on top of us for long periods, but we found a way to win.\u201d Robert Howley was left to reflect a failure to find touch at the end. \u201cWe made some errors and there was a momentum change in the final 15 minutes, but we played our part in a Test match full of quality,\u201d the Wales interim coach said. \u201cEngland have developed the knack of winning and they are a hard side to beat.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
