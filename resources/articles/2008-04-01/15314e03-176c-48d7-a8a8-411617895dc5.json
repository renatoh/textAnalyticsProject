The rapture with which Mahler's Fifth Symphony was received in this eve-of-departure concert bodes well for the tour. Meanwhile, the artistic audit that inevitably accompanies the end of an era must surely conclude that Oramo's time has been hugely successful. Here he elicited playing of the highest order, with the string section - ranged, unusually for the CBSO, with basses at the back and cellos and second violins swapping places - projecting the glorious tone that is arguably the greatest benefit of the Oramo legacy. Stephen Isserlis was soloist in Haydn's Cello Concerto at the start of the evening, with Oramo and Isserlis achieving a nicely understated interpretation and the kind of pianissimo that only Symphony Hall permits. But the evening belonged to Oramo and Mahler. The intensity of each moment was all-embracing, yet Oramo handled the vast architectural sweep of the work with integrity and rigour, ensuring an overall momentum that was totally convincing. The attention to detail was often heart-stopping, not least in the opening funeral march, where the timpani repeats the rhythm of the trumpet's opening fanfare. And, if time seemed as if it might stand still in the glowing adagietto, the urgency of the cello line presaged an altogether more volcanic core to this movement. At the end of a stunning final part, Oramo was quick to hail his musicians, but the feeling was mutual. \u00b7 Repeated on May 1.
