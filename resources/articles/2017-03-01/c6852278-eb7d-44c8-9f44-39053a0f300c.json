Eddie Jones\u2019s men aim to take another step towards a second successive grand slam with what would be a record 11th straight championship victory, equalling New Zealand\u2019s mark of 18 successive Test wins by a tier one team in the process. England have not lost to Scotland since 2008 and have won 15 out of 16 of their Twickenham contests \u2013 with one draw \u2013 since the Scots\u2019 last victory there, in 1983. But Visser, who played for Harlequins last weekend a week after scoring the clinching try for Scotland in their victory over Wales, senses a change in the usual Calcutta Cup mood music. \u201cThey are probably pretending to be more confident than they are,\u201d said the 29-year-old, who retains his place ahead of a fit-again Sean Maitland. \u201cSpeaking to the English public, they think Scotland have got a realistic chance. The players themselves are not as cocky as they normally are, which is a good sign. They have the track record and the results against us, so they probably have good reason to be like that. But they are not as loud as they normally are.\u201d Visser is one of a rare breed of Scottish players with happy memories of Twickenham, having won there several times with Harlequins, most recently against Gloucester in their annual festive fixture. While expecting a backlash from an England side that struggled to cope with Italy\u2019s left-field tactics, the Dutch-born flier insists Scotland\u2019s appetite has not been sated by their first win over Wales in a decade. Ending a 34-year winless run at Twickenham clearly has appeal. \u201cIt is amazing. I have been part of a few smaller victories, like the one against France last year [Scotland\u2019s first for 10 years], and the one against Wales. It makes you want to do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cI am so excited this week because you don\u2019t want to be the guy who isn\u2019t part of a big victory like that. \u201cI think we have been getting better and better as the tournament has gone on, culminating in the win over Wales. But we don\u2019t want that to be our end station. We want to be moving forward so we are trying to keep our feet on the ground.\u201d Their head coach, Vern Cotter, was unsurprisingly a little more circumspect about Scotland\u2019s prospects, insisting their long barren sequence at Twickenham has played no part in preparations. Despite impressive wins over Ireland and Wales, and a narrow defeat in Paris, Cotter believes Scotland have yet to produce a complete performance themselves. \u201cWe don\u2019t like the idea of hoping for a win,\u201d he said before his final away assignment in the role. \u201cWe would like to construct and build a victory.\u201d The Kiwi insisted there would be no attempt to replicate any of Italy\u2019s shock tactics \u2013 \u201cWe haven\u2019t got anything we are dragging out of the box, we are just trying to find points of access against a team that is strong all over\u201d \u2013 but is bullish about seeking to attack England where they are perceived to have an advantage. \u201cOur scrum has trained very well this week and we think we can challenge their scrum. And obviously we want to compete as hard as we can on the ground, as effectively as we can.\u201d To that end, Hamish Watson\u2019s return from the start \u2013 Scotland\u2019s only change \u2013 hardly weakens the visitors, the Edinburgh flanker having replaced the stricken John Hardie early on against Wales and added to the positive impression he made in Scotland\u2019s opening two matches. Watson and the captain, John Barclay, will be tasked with disrupting England\u2019s \u201cmomentum surges\u201d at source, while the abrasive South African-born No8 Cornell Du Preez, who qualified for Scotland on residency grounds after three years with Edinburgh, is set for his Test debut from the bench. Scotland are well aware that England, with both Vunipola brothers, Billy and Mako, now among their \u201cfinishers\u201d, have enjoyed a late power surge in all three games to date. \u201cI think their philosophy will be: \u2018Scotland will throw everything at it, but we have a stronger bench, and we will finish off the game,\u2019\u201d Cotter noted. \u201cWe know what is coming but we need to apply pressure for as long as we can and take the initiative, so we make their players adapt to us rather than us adapting to them.\u201d Scotland side to face England at Twickenham S Hogg; T Seymour, H Jones, A Dunbar, T Visser, F Russell, A Price; G Reid, F Brown, Z Fagerson, R Gray, J Gray, J Barclay (capt), H Watson, R Wilson.
