Unai Emery, Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s manager, has admitted on the eve of the Champions League getting under way that he feels a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to deliver success after a summer transfer splurge. Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 have joined Dani Alves in Paris, with finance as delivered from Qatar placing the club among Europe\u2019s elite. All three are expected to play at Celtic on Tuesday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s true that it\u2019s the most important competition,\u201d Emery said. \u201cSo I have a lot of responsibility, with so many good players at my disposal. \u201cWe go into the game with a lot of confidence. We have worked hard and we will have to work hard here. I feel that we look forward to good start. I know, obviously, that the Champions League is a big objective for the club. But I know it\u2019s going to be difficult against Celtic.\u201d Thiago Silva, PSG\u2019s captain and an international team-mate of Neymar, emphasised the confidence that exists within Emery\u2019s squad. Silva insisted events of last season \u2013 PSG lost 6-1 to Barcelona in the reversal of a 4-0 first leg win at the last 16 stage \u2013 are \u201calready forgotten\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we are the [Champions League] favourites,\u201d the defender said. \u201cWe should get close this year. There are a lot of players with a lot of quality across the Champions League. But we have a lot of talent in our team. We\u2019ve prepared hard for the Champions League and we are very motivated. \u201cWe know that Celtic are a very good team. We know how hard they are to beat at home. We expect a match with a lot of intensity. They will be very strong in closing us down, trying to stop us from playing. We analysed them this morning. \u201cBut with the players we\u2019ve got, we are aiming to go far. The atmosphere in the team is magnificent. We will try to handle the pressure as well as we can. If we stick together, we can handle the pressure of trying to go far in the Champions League.\u201d Silva smiled when asked whether training had become significantly more difficult for defenders given the arrival of Mbapp\u00e9 and Neymar. \u201cThe recruitment was very good,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are both experienced and they are both very motivated to improve this team. We have confidence in them as team-mates. Neymar has so much experience in the Champions League. He can maybe make the difference. The three players we have signed are incredible. \u201cIt\u2019s just normal that training is hard. When you\u2019ve got these guys in there with this technique and ability on the ball, it\u2019s an impossible task to stop them every time. They have their own individual quality. Neymar\u2019s speed is almost unstoppable. Marking him in training is improving me. \u201cBoth Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 are very intelligent footballers, as is Dani Alves. It\u2019s very easy for them. I spoke with Neymar a lot before he signed, about the positives and negatives of the club. He has settled very quickly. As I expected him to.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
