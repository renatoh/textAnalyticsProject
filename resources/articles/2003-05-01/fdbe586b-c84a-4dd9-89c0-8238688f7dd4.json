Next month the contracts of Europe's only female professional side end and the search for alternative employment begins. Hailed as pioneers three years ago, the Fulham team have been described by an FA spokesperson as \"an anachronism, something that maybe happened a little too soon\". The manager Gaute Haugenes and his No7 and wife Margunn have bought their new house in Norway. Astrid Johannessen, Katrine Pedersen and Kristy Moore, who volleyed in yesterday's opener from Haugenes's cross, will also leave. The Cup final has always been unique, the one day a year that the women's game can impress itself upon the nation at large. But this year it should also have marked another event. If the past three years had gone according to plan, today should have been the day on which the leading players handed in their notices and celebrated the end of amateurism. Charlton's valiant runners-up are due at a warm-down session tonight, which for many has to be fitted between an eight-hour shift and a long drive home. So where does the sport go from here? When the FA announced in February 2000 that women's football would have \"a professional league by 2003\", the game raised its eyebrows but rallied round. Doncaster Belles, who on a good day attract a crowd of 500, drew up plans to build their own stadium. Wolves gave the sport its first \"personality manager\" with the appointment of the former European Cup-winning captain Dennis Mortimer. Most importantly, Mohamed Al Fayed gave the game the best story of its recent history when he decided that \u00a33m was a small price to pay to ensure Fulham would have a place in the top tier when the new era dawned. For all the sniping and grumbling from within the women's game, the effect of Fayed's investment has been immense. Despite the fact that Charlton's Karen Hills and Fara Williams accounted for two of Fulham's three goals yesterday, the pace, strength and technique on show represented a considerable growth year on year. Arsenal, Leeds, Bristol Rovers, Southampton and Doncaster have all embraced semi-professionalism. Next season, of course, the knock-on effect will come full circle when Fulham join them. Nevertheless the final showed an amateur sport struggling to meet an ambition that was always beyond it. Charlton still play their home games in Bromley, next to a paddock where horses graze. Fulham play in whichever part of Surrey they can. Even at Arsenal all is not well. When the Danish champions Fortuna Hjorring played the Gunners in the semi-final of the Uefa Women's Cup two weekends ago, their manager complained that their dressing room was \"an old blue container with no bath\". Neither side trained at Barnet's Underhill Stadium the day before the match because it cost \u00a3200 a day to hire. \"There is a tightening of belts all around football,\" Arsenal's manager Vic Akers said, \"and the women will always be the first to suffer.\" \"We've come a long way in women's football,\" said the FA. \"But we're a participation sport, not a spectator sport. We have looked into the viability of a professional league but we have no date set against it. We have no clear direction from a permanent chief executive.\" For the third year running the final drew more than 10,000 to Selhurst Park. But a more important figure was announced: there are now 84,956 female players registered in England, an increase of more than 20,000 on last year. That the biggest rise was among under-16s, where applicants receive information leaflets along with tattoo kits featuring Rachel Yankey, yesterday's player of the match, suggests exceptional health at grass-roots level. Once the face painters, stilt-walkers, artificial smoke and wobbly cheerleaders had cleared, Charlton let themselves down by poor finishing and inadequate defence of set pieces. \"Some of the girls underperformed out there, but we'll be back next season,\" said Charlton's manager Keith Boanas. They will be returning to a game that is not so much pursuing professionalism as accepting ambitious amateurism.
