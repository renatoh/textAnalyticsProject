Everything he does seems designed to frustrate, taunt and confound his opponents. This is possibly why he has been overlooked for top fights over the years. It is certainly why he is now WBC title-holder after convincingly beating DeMarcus Corley at Alexandra Palace. From the first round Witter switched every 10 seconds and Corley found nothing to deal with his often brash style. By the time the American world champion found Witter's increasingly open chin in round six, the Briton was already five rounds ahead. Witter's tactics of confusion combined with relentless forward movement in the early rounds put him an unassailable distance ahead well before Corley was given the merest glimpzse of hope in a fight dominated by a boxer with a plan against a man without one. Only when Witter opted for a ridiculous stand-off in round seven did Corley look anything other than clueless and the shadow of a man supposedly at the top of his game. Witter repeatedly caught the American with right-hand blows to the head and body, without landing a shot capable of stopping him. The fight petered out towards the end, leaving the judges from Belgium, South Africa and Mexico to score unanimously in favour of Witter - 119-111, 118-112 and 117-113. This win increases the likelihood of the fight boxing fans want to see between Witter and Manchester's Ricky Hatton, if only politics allows it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
