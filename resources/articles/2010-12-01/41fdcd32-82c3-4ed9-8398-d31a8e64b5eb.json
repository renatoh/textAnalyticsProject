The latter was a deceptively simple but witty take on the JK Rowling oeuvre. This is not up to that standard, but as Dan Clarkson and Jefferson Turner work their way through titles featuring the letters P, at least we can take comfort from the fact that we have been spared Potted Pooh. Although, of course, being a Dan and Jeff show, we haven't. There are poo and vomit jokes galore, and men-in-dresses gags, as the pair desecrate some of the great panto titles and conventions, and get their Abanazar mixed up with their Ebenezer. It's one long wheeze, and if it sometimes feels overstretched at 95 minutes, the pair seize every opportunity to narrate their way out of trouble or blast the audience with water. There's even a bouncy giant pumpkin to bat around. Even so, Panto probably doesn't have quite the wide appeal of Potter and Pirates, and the endlessly bright Ant and Dec-style double act is a little wearing for anybody over the age of 10. Still it's the relationship \u2013 Jeff's attempts to take charge, and Dan's to scupper any order \u2013 that gives the show its strong skeleton and a genuine warmth. It's a bit hit and miss, but it gallops on so fast that the failures are soon forgotten, and unlike most genuine pantomimes there is a really great piece of audience participation featuring a 3D journey to nowhere but tear-inducing laughter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
