About this time of year, two years ago, our boy Max was finishing his last term at school. Since I had trundled up and down the M4 with the boot full of old tennis rackets, gym shoes, books, computers and so forth more times than I care to remember over a period of almost 30 years, I decided to give myself a day off. \"You've passed your driving test, haven't you?\" I said to Max. \"Why don't you borrow the car and bring your own things back for once. Don't bother about the ottoman. It has probably had it anyway.\" I should explain that at Max's school ottomans were compulsory. All the boys had to have them from day one. The rectangular padded chests were convenient to sit on and inside dirty games kit and half-eaten tins of baked beans could be safely stowed. Some Ottomans had been handed down from father to son or from brother to brother. In the event, Max dutifully left his ottoman behind in his third-floor room with its uplifting views of Windsor Castle. The rest of his gear he carried downstairs and stuffed in the car. When he returned to London in due course, I helped him unload. I couldn't help noticing that there was a large dent in the fuselage. Surprisingly, the damage was not to the body of the car. It was on the roof, just above the rear door on the passenger side. \"I'm afraid that was Teddy's ottoman,\" Max explained nonchalantly. \"He's in the next room to me. He tossed it out of the window aiming for a skip, but unfortunately it hit the car.\" Well, that was two years ago and since then the water, when it rains, has been seeping into the upholstery. The musty smell has become so bad that quite soon I shall have to do something about it though, as King Lear put it, what that is yet I know not. In the meantime we drive, rain or shine, with the windows wide open. Talking of King Lear reminds me of something Sara Crystal's mother, Licia, said the other day. I should explain that Sara is a good friend of my younger daughter, Julia, and is a loyal supporter of the band, Second Person, of which Julia is the lead singer. One evening, Sara was at a pub in south London where the band was performing. She knew that my wife Jenny and I would be coming along later to hear the band. Sara sent us a message: could we possibly stop by the house and bring her mum, too? Now Licia was, as it turned out, in a fragile state. She had just lost her own mum, Nancy, at a ripe old age. For some reason as we drove through Clapham in our ottoman-injured Subaru, windows down, we started talking about productions of King Lear we had seen. Licia told us, with a tremor in her voice, that the last play she had taken her mother to was Ian Holm's King Lear at the Cottesloe. \"Ian Holm was terrific. The Cottesloe is such a small, intimate theatre. It suited him beautifully. You remember when Lear says: \"How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child?'\" My wife nodded. I would have nodded too, but Jenny takes a tough line. She doesn't like me to nod and drive. \"My mother called out,\" Licia continued, \"so that everyone in that little theatre could hear: 'You know, he's so right!'\" Out of the corner of my eye, I could see her dab away a tear. I mentioned in last week's column that I was going to Paris for a Unesco meeting on great apes. We broke early for a longish lunch in a nearby restaurant. As we sat down, I checked my mobile for messages. There was one from Jenny. \"Julia and I are OK.\" I quickly sent one back. \"I am OK 2. Very decent Brouilly.\" Soon after that, the phone beeped with a message from my son, Jo, who works for the Financial Times in India. \"Are you all right?\" Jo wrote. Later, there were voicemails from another son, Leo, who was in Brazil on environmental business and a sister, Hilary, in Australia. By the time the dessert arrived I had begun to suspect that something might be amiss. We will all of us have our own stories to tell about how we heard the news. That's mine."}, "isHosted": false}}}
