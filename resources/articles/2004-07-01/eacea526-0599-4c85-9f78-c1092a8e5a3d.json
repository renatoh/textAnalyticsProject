In the sombre pit of the old stalls there is a 1950s feel: pale skin, beards and cigarette smoke, dark denim and leather. Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti lurk in the shadows. On screen are colliding moons and vivid neon streets, the soundtrack a sinister, nursery-rhyme kazoo. Blood-red tarmac and rock 'n' roll hammering away; fields and star bursts; William Blake goes disco and vanishes into a mausoleum. Then the whisper of suburban curtains swaying against a pale winter sky; a glistening cleaver against the soft flesh of someone's palm, and a claustrophobic, close-up drunk swigging from a litre of vodka. The Northampton College festival of short films gets under way. Julie Teckman, head of media at the college, introduces Russell, who runs the A-level film and video course. \"This is about learning to see the world,\" she tells me. \"It's not about blockbusters and gangster movies - it's a powerful medium, it exposes what people's lives are like. It makes people ingenious. These films are made for nothing, no-budget movies. You have to use what you've got around you.\" We turn and watch a howling rant against the war; dozens of still images hurled onto the screen. People in the audience start to boo. \"That's got them going,\" says Russell, clearly delighted. \"Well,\" says Teckman, \"there's a place for everyone. We don't just get the obvious students - we get people who have poor literacy skills, asylum seekers, some older people; they can show how things are for them.\" Or how things are for their toaster. Dan's film is a gentle, meandering piece about his toaster and how it deals with its lot. Dan, very 1950s Left Bank, explains it to me: \"We've had that toaster for a long time, holding it against its will. It's a passive/aggressive toaster, kind of regrets the role it's been given. The toaster's frustrated. It's kind of _ allegorical.\" Then up on the screen there is a film with chattering sheep, in a dithering dance routine of synchronised grazing. Dan sees me laughing and takes me off to meet its author. \"The sheep,\" she explains, \"are about America, where everything has to be fast and still all at once.\" \"Lauren made a porn film last year,\" says Dan, \"with Mitzi the Mouse.\" Lauren's next film tonight is about vindictive dolls arguing over tea, their dialogue magically typed on the table cloth. Above them the teddy bears register the agony and rage of something dying. \"I spend a lot of time thinking,\" says Lauren. Tom says: \"You can't degrade a duck, ducks are always gorgeous.\" His two-minute film is a rant against pornography. \"I made the images childish so that the childishness infects the porno.\" Matt Kelly used to manage the dispatch department at an engineering firm but quit to do an HND in media production (\"You can dispatch just so many ball bearings\"). His film creates a sinister pastel range of colours, rapid psychedelic close-ups of teeth, lips, skin. He looks anxious. \"Does it make sense?\" Ben Vavengo's film makes sense. Well, it does if you think Benny Hill and Norman Wisdom are coherent. His film is full of gags, a tragicomic, drunken burlesque with a smug, pudgy-faced stooge and a cartoon whore. \"All I said to her was 'dress up as a prostitute and come in'. She's obviously a natural.\" The panel of judges sits in the dark on a big leather sofa, taking notes and bickering. They go off into a corner to decide on the winners. They can't decide and the film-makers and their pals are getting impatient; drink is taking its toll on their goodwill. There is a bit of slow handclapping and then an outburst of lobbying through mobile phones. Julie Teckman is jumping up and down: \"Yes, yes, they've chosen.\" She turns to the crowd, exultant. \"They've made their decision. First prize is Ben Vavengo.\" Ben stands there, shy and delighted. There are speeches to make, people to thank, applause, humility, tears."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
