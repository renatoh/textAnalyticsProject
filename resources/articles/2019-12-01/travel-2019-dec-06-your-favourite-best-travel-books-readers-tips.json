She does so not \u2013 as the nature or personal narrative writers du jour might, by describing the landscape, which is surely biblical in places \u2013 but almost exclusively through encounters with fellow travellers in the now long-extinct smoking carriage. It\u2019s wonderful. \u2022 Little, Brown, \u00a39.99, available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a38.79 inc UK p&amp;p Cornelia Last unknown country, Kazakhstan In Search of Kazakhstan: The Land that Disappeared by Christopher Robbins was a massive eye-opener for me. In 2012 I took a three-month placement as an ELT teacher trainer in a small town in western Kazakhstan. It was a fascinating experience. I lived in a hotel-cum-wedding palace as virtually the only guest and learnt much from the friendly hotel staff as well as from my students and colleagues. However, this book was indispensable in filling me in about the horrors perpetrated on this land and its people during the Soviet era. The sadness is balanced by a plethora of quirky and endearing facts and anecdotes. It\u2019s a marvellous read for armchair travellers and intrepid adventurers alike. \u2022 Profile, \u00a310.99, available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a39.67 inc UK p&amp;p Felicity Harwood Parisian backstreet eats I guess it is only me who treats this as a travel book but I rarely visit Paris without a copy of Between Meals by AJ Liebling, a New York journalist who studied in Paris in the 1920s and described what he did between meals, which varied considerably in price and quality depending on how long it was since he\u2019d last received his allowance from his parents. He recalls the opening of my favourite Paris restaurant, La Coupole, in 1927. He takes you down back streets to eateries that still exist today, 90 years later, and you can sit in a cafe fantasising that the guy eating his cassoulet or his poached trout is AJ himself. \u2022 North Point, \u00a312.99 Greg Thesiger in southern Iraq The best travel book I have ever read is The Marsh Arabs by Wilfred Thesiger, published in 1964. Never before had I felt so envious of the freedom afforded to men or to have lived in an earlier time. To roam alone, widely and without borders, to live in far flung places, became my ideal \u2013 an ideal that I have for the most part lived up to \u2013 but not, I fear, with quite the same abandonment that Thesiger describes. For in all my travels one eye is on the road but the other looks to my physical safety. I have, however, travelled widely and lived voraciously on many continents, in no small part inspired by the words of those who have gone before me. \u2022 Penguin, \u00a312.99, available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a311.43 inc UK p&amp;p Victoria Bryson\u2019s European wanderings There are no gimmicks, just top travel writing in Neither Here Nor There by Bill Bryson. You feel like you\u2019re in these places with Bill, even if you have never been there. I feel I\u2019ve seen the northern lights in Hammerfest, I\u2019m convinced I\u2019ve been to Florence. I\u2019ve done neither. Describing idiosyncrasies of places I have visited, though, ring so true. Is there a better line in modern travel writing than: \u201cRomans park their cars the way I would park if I had just spilled a beaker of hydrochloric acid on my lap\u201d? Inspired me to do my own trip across this amazing place (Europe) right on our doorstep, albeit with more zorbing and fewer churches. \u2022 Transworld, \u00a38.99, available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a37.91 inc UK p&amp;p Antony T Chatwin down under I\u2019m about to leave for Australia, and Bruce Chatwin\u2019s The Songlines provides a great window into travel in the outback and indigenous Australians. I expect this book will massively impact my view of the original custodians of the land. It challenges the western view point of borders and territories. According to Chatwin, in the indigenous culture territories are lines and routes which overlap and interlock, not blocks of land. Australia can at times feel like Europe with kangaroos, so it\u2019s important to look at the cultural aspects which makes it different. \u2022 Vintage, \u00a310.99, available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a39.67 inc UK p&amp;p Daniel Atkinson Disaster-prone backpacking How Not to Travel the World by Lauren Juliff is an account of a shy, awkward and inexperienced traveller taking her first trip around the world. While the misadventures are amusing, the beauty of this book comes in the gradual change that comes about as she travels, discovers new places, new people, and herself. Anyone who has travelled will relate to parts of this book, and it\u2019s comforting to read that we all make mistakes, but can learn and grow from them. \u2022 Summersdale, \u00a39.99 Matthew Scott Teacher\u2019s epic In 1986, headmistress Anne Mustoe retired from her job and bought a bicycle, with the simple aim of cycling around the world. Her book, A Bike Ride \u2013 12,000 Miles Around the World, documents her journey but also traces the histories, people and places through which she travels. Mustoe\u2019s writing is intelligent, informed and civilised; she is clearly interested in everyone she meets and everything she sees on her epic trip. She is also an inspiration for anyone who thinks they may have left it too late in life for an adventure \u2013 her advice, reiterated throughout the book, is simple \u2013 just GO! \u2022 Ebury, \u00a312.99, available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a311.43 inc UK p&amp;p Jo Devine Motorbike diaries The most inspiring books for me have been those of Lois Pryce \u2013 such as Red Tape and White Knuckles and Revolutionary Ride \u2013 because travelling by motorbike has to be the best way of seeing and experiencing new places and people. As a woman approaching 60, I am looking forward to exploring South and North America, Australia and more of New Zealand. \u2022 Cornerstone, \u00a310.99, available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a311.43 inc UK p&amp;p Jacki Cole US on the backroads Before I, my wife and two teenagers set off on a coast-to-coast US road trip, we all read Blue Highways (published in 1982) and agreed to head down the backroads to discover real, off-the-beaten-track America. William Least Heat-Moon (what a name!) packed up his basic belongings into a battered old camper van in search of himself , individuals and communities in little villages with inspiring names like New Freedom and Simplicity, meeting tramps, mechanics, musicians and schoolteachers on the way. He wrote this great book as a celebration of carefree travelling, claiming: \u201cWhen you travel, you are what you are, there and then. There are no yesterdays on the road\u201d. How right he was. \u2022 Vintage, \u00a312.50, available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a311 inc UK p&amp;p Bill \u2018Race with the rains\u2019, India Chasing the Monsoon by Alexander Frater is the story of the astonishing phenomenon of the Indian summer monsoon. Frater captures the beauty of the monsoon from its arrival at Cape Comorin, at the tip of southern India, and its journey northwards through the subcontinent. It is \u201ca race with the rains\u201d as he describes the fluctuating fortunes and disasters of villages until his eventual arrival in Cherrapunju, Assam, the wettest place on Earth. It captures the beauty, the culture and unpredictable nature of India in what is an exuberant rollercoaster of a book. Travel writing at its best. \u2022 Pan Macmillan, \u00a39.99, available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a38.79 inc UK p&amp;p Neil Edwards Inspiration in \u2018Little Tibet\u2019 I have devoured most of Dervla Murphy\u2019s books but my favourite by far is Where the Indus is Young. Murphy recounts her trip in the Karakoram mountains with her six-year-old daughter, Rachel. The level of detail in her writing added to the sense of real adventure make it gripping. Will they find food or a place to rest? Is the pass passable with a young child? Murphy really is an intrepid traveller and a true inspiration. \u2022 Eland, \u00a312.99 Jennie O\u2019Hara Looking for a holiday with a difference?
