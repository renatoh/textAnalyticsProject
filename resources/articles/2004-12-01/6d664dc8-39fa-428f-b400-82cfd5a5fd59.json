Riot police were called after fighting broke out inside the stadium shortly after the final whistle and 10 arrests were made by West Yorkshire Police. There were also problems outside the ground, with reports of violence between rival supporters at Leeds railway station. \"We are making inquiries into what happened,\" confirmed an FA spokesman. \"We will speak to police about the incidents.\" \"Some of the incidents appear to have occurred outside the ground, in which case they would not fall under our jurisdiction.\" Leeds led for most of the game before the already tense atmosphere worsened when Millwalll were awarded a penalty in the 86th minute. Jody Morris, who had an unhappy eight-month spell at Leeds last season, stepped up to take the spot kick and ruin the home side's chance to take three points. Morris, who had been goaded by the Leeds fans throughout, responded to his goal by running 70 yards with one hand cupped over his ear in a mocking gesture to the home supporters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
