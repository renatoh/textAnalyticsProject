The diehard Republicans of Kansas caucused today and delivered a big victory for Mike Huckabee, McCain's remaining serious challenger. With all the ballots counted Huckabee won 60% of the votes in Kansas, with McCain well behind on 24% and Ron Paul on 11%. The Associated Press quotes the Kansas GOP state chairman as saying that Huckabee's performance \"sends a pretty significant signal to John McCain that he's got a lot of work to do to get significant factions of the Republican party solidly behind him.\" Huckabee insisted the result means the contest was far from over. It might be argued that with a McCain victory all but inevitable, only those opponents could be bothered to caucus today - even though both Republican senators out campaigning for McCain. With Louisiana and Washington state voting later today, so we'll know more then - especially from the Washington state result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
