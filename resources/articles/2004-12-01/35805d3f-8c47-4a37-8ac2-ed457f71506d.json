He knew he was a gifted player with a rock-solid technique and a set of career stats to delight the anoraks. But did he have the nous to adapt his game to circumstance? Was he able to move through the gears and destroy an attack? Yesterday we got our answer, and it has changed the whole complexion of this series. By the time Kallis pulled Matthew Hoggard into the hands of the substitute fielder Paul Collingwood for 162, he had played the most demoralising innings England have suffered all year. That includes Brian Lara's quadruple century in Antigua, where West Indies had already lost the series. For Kallis yesterday, context was everything. When South Africa stumbled to 118 for six, England might have been dreaming of first-innings parity. But the home side bats deep now, and there was plenty of time to forge the partnerships which Duncan Fletcher, once Kallis's coach at Western Province, has identified as the key to batting on this Kingsmead pitch. Kallis put on 87 with Shaun Pollock, 38 with Nicky Boje, 50 with Makhaya Ntini and 39 with Dale Steyn. In all the last four wickets added 214; suddenly England needed 193 just to avoid an innings defeat. \"They dished out a few bumpers,\" said Kallis, \"but it's nice to see the guys stay in line and show a bit of guts and determination.\" The Kallis of stereotype might have operated on cruise control, working the ones and twos and hitting the bad balls to the fence. But there was a more human side on display here, borne of a natural desire to dominate once he had got the measure of the pitch and the bowlers. One pull for four off Andrew Flintoff was followed two balls later by a rousing hook for six. The first fifty came up in 97 balls, the second in 89 and the third in 58. By the end he was unveiling his full repertoire: three fours in a Simon Jones over - a drive through extra cover, a tiptoe slash through point and an easy-as-you-like loft down the ground - brought the crowd to its feet. It is not often Kallis has done that. \"It's as good as I've seen him play,\" said Barry Richards, the former South African opener. \"He's listened to the criticism of not accelerating and hopefully this will take his career to a new level.\" England might regard that as a frightening thought. Kallis now averages 54.97 in Test cricket which, Bradman aside, places him in the highest class. Throw in 166 wickets at just over 30 and you wonder why he has never quite turned heads as he might have done. After all, the career figures of Garfield Sobers - 57.78 with the bat, 34.03 with the ball - are not a million miles away. The answer, perhaps, lies in his perceived approach to the game, a regimented bat-by-numbers method that seems to preclude innovation. Kallis has never had the flair of Brian Lara, the charisma of Sachin Tendulkar or the explosiveness of Matthew Hayden. But yesterday he did a decent impression of all three. \"I don't think he can play any better,\" said the former South Africa captain Kepler Wessels. Kallis was a little more circumspect, saying that he still rated his first Test century, against Australia, as his favourite innings. \"But then the first one is always special,\" he conceded. He deserved to be bracketed with the modern giants even before yesterday. Perhaps now he will take his place without the usual caveats about a lack of sparkle and brainpower. One story tells of the time he was feeling a little groggy after a jog along the beach. \"Must have been the altitude,\" he wheezed to a team-mate. But for now Kallis is touching new heights and no one is laughing. He has scored 1,278 Test runs in 2004, breaking Graeme Smith's South African record of 1,198 which he established mainly at England's expense last year. And seven of his 18 Test hundreds have now been 150 or more. He ascribes his run-laden year to a more rounded approach, both on and off the pitch. Kallis lost his father to cancer during South Africa's tour of England in 2003 and believes the experience changed him for the better. \"It was a difficult year for me, and it taught me a lot,\" he said. \"It made a me mature a bit and that was maybe what I needed.\" At 29, there is plenty of time to make the most of his new-found perspective. He could yet turn himself into South Africa's most revered cricketer of all time, eclipsing near-mythological figures such as Barry Richards, Graeme Pollock, Eddie Barlow and Mike Procter. Whatever happens, though, he will always have Durban."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
