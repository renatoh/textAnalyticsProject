Even in a country long used to violence, the 4 November massacre of three women and six children as they travelled a lonely road through the Sierra Madre mountains shocked many Mexicans \u2013 not least because there seemed no explanation for the bloodshed. Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Montes, nicknamed El Mudo (The Mute) or El 32, was detained late on Monday in an operation carried out by the federal prosecutor\u2019s office and members of the army and navy, according to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez newspaper El Diario de Ju\u00e1rez. Adri\u00e1n LeBar\u00f3n, whose daughter Rhonita Miller and her eight-month-old twins were murdered in the attack, confirmed the arrest on Twitter, where he described it as \u201ca step toward knowing the truth about who killed my children\u201d. He also identified Gonz\u00e1lez as \u201cleader of La L\u00ednea cartel section (Nuevo) Casas Grandes\u201d \u2013 a city in Chihuahua state near the US border with New Mexico. Two others were detained with El Mudo. La L\u00ednea is considered the armed wing of the Ju\u00e1rez cartel and is accused of running extortion rackets in the region, among other illegal activities. In a WhatsApp message, Julian LeBar\u00f3n, a relative of the victims, described El Mudo as \u201cthe highest-ranking cartel guy on site\u201d. \u201cThis guy is considered in our region, which is the north-west region [of Chihuahua], to be the top cartel dog, the top enforcer for the Ju\u00e1rez cartel,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a pretty big deal locally.\u201d The massacre prompted an angry response from Donald Trump, who threatend to designate Mexican drug cartels as terror organisations. It also cast a spotlight on the fundamentalist Mormon families of north-western Mexico, whose ancestors relocated in the late 19th century to avoid US polygamy laws. The tightly knit community has become well-known in Mexico for fighting back against attempts at kidnapping and extortion. All of the victims were dual US-Mexico citizens, a status which Juli\u00e1n LeBar\u00f3n has said allows them some ability to speak openly against organized crime in Mexico. Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has met with the family and travelled twice to Bavispe \u2013 the municipality in Sonora state where the crime was committed. The president inaugurated a national guard station there in October. US investigators, including the FBI, have been involved in the investigation, Julian LeBar\u00f3n said. \u201cOfficially, we\u2019ve been told that two cartels were duking it out and my cousins just happened to be driving by. But there are many unanswered questions, and hopefully we can get them answered eventually,\u201d Julian LeBar\u00f3n said. \u201cThey told us that over 100 people participated in that massacre and they\u2019re going after all of them. But one thing is to capture all these people, and another thing that is very distinct and different is for them to be tried, and have them go to prison for a long time. That almost never happens.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
