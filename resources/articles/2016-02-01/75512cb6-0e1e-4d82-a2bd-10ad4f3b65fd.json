The Everton chairman remains in talks over a possible \u00a3200m takeover with John Jay Moores and Charles Noell, the American investors whose exclusivity agreement with the club expired last month but who hope to conclude a deal before the end of the season. Moores, a former San Diego Padres owner, and Noell are not the only interested party and Mart\u00ednez believes whoever acquires Everton would be remiss not to utilise Kenwright\u2019s influence from 27 years on the Goodison board, the last 17 as the majority shareholder. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said the Everton manager regarding a proposed takeover. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always said what the chairman is for Everton and I wouldn\u2019t want Bill Kenwright to lose his association with Everton, ever. I think it would be a loss if we do that. Whatever the investment or whatever the situation is in the future, in 10 or 15 years I would love to see Everton benefit from our chairman for the rest of his life.\u201d Kenwright, 70, has said for several years he wants to sell Everton to the right investor. The need to relocate from or redevelop Goodison Park has proved one deterrent to potential buyers but despite net debt of \u00a331.3m in 2014-15, the manager insists the club\u2019s finances are strong before the record \u00a35.14bn broadcasting deal. Mart\u00ednez added: \u201cWe are not in a situation where we need to be rescued or we need some sort of financial boost to save the club. That\u2019s not the case. We are in a very strong position. We don\u2019t have to sell players for financial reasons, so new owners would need to understand the club, what Everton is and what it represents to thousands of families. From that point on I can say to every Evertonian that our chairman is the perfect person to make the final calls going forward. \u201cI don\u2019t think a takeover is going to be that drastic. If there is an investor there\u2019s not going to be a drastic change on day one or day two. If it happens it\u2019s going to be over three years or a period where everything is well controlled and introduced. I think new investors would bring the opportunity to fulfil the projects we have behind the scenes and help the ultimate dream, which is becoming one of the best teams domestically and in European football.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
