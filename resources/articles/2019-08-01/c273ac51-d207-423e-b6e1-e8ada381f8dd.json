Labour announced it would make it illegal to train or keep marmosets, capuchins, squirrel monkeys and lemurs, as the political parties begin to set out their policies ahead of a possible general election this autumn. Animal welfare issues harmed the Conservatives in the 2017 election, after the party pledged to hold a free vote on hunting and was criticised for failing to include a policy on banning the ivory trade in its manifesto. Ahead of a potential poll this autumn, Labour restated its commitment to banning the keeping of monkeys, as part of its animal welfare manifesto due to be published in the next few weeks. Luke Pollard, the shadow environment minister, said: \u201cIt is astonishing that it is still entirely legal to keep primates as pets, regardless of how endangered or dangerous the animal is. Anyone can browse the internet and buy a primate with little or no checks and inspections. \u201cWe know that primates are very intelligent, social animals with complex needs that simply cannot be met in a home environment. \u201cLabour will ban people from keeping pet primates as part of our plans to bring Britain\u2019s animal welfare laws into the 21st century.\u201d Labour said an estimated 5,000 primates are being kept as pets in the UK, but they are highly intelligent animals and not suitable to be kept in captivity. Current legislation states that animal owners must prevent \u201cunnecessary suffering\u201d and must take \u201call reasonable steps to meet their animal\u2019s needs\u201d, but Labour argued it is difficult to enforce and a breach of its provisions is not an offence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
