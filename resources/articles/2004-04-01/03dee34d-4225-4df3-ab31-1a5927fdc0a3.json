The earliest ever start to a first-class season saw the MCC take on the champion county for the first time since 1991. A fair number of spectators believed the optimistic weather forecast and celebrated the game's return, seeing first-time champions Sussex dismissed in time for an early tea. MCC's skipper Andy Flower was the only member of his team without higher ambitions - he was handed a list of England fringe players and hopefuls, although Lancashire's quick bowler Sajid Mahmood pulled out at the last minute to attend his sister's wedding in Islamabad. This gave Glamorgan's Adam Harrison his first-class debut, which he celebrated with the prestigious early wicket of the Surrey emigre Ian Ward, clipping off his toes to square leg. Sussex's skipper Chris Adams was missing, recovering from an operation on his elbow, but he is expected to be in place for the start of Sussex's defence of their title at The Oval next Friday. Murray Goodwin deputised. With Richard Montgomerie anchoring the innings at a sedate run per over, the steady Sussex subsidence seemed more due to rust that recklessness. But tribute should be paid to the MCC's fast-medium persistence on a true pitch. Their quartet - Martin Saggers, Harrison, Alex Gidman and Graham Napier - found a little swing in the crisp air, some movement from the wicket, and nagged away like fishwives for most of the innings. When Kent's James Tredwell was at last allowed to twirl his brisk off-breaks - plus a lovely wrong 'un to unstick the limpet Montgomerie - he celebrated with three wickets for eight runs in 13 deliveries, and Sussex were gone for a round 200. Warwickshire's Ian Bell took full advantage of the long final session. MCC set off at a one-day pace but three wickets brought Sussex back into the game. Bell, 70 not out, was settled by then and showing a firm touch and flourished with Flower, 40 not out, in a stand of 95 to put MCC in charge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
