At least 373 people were killed and many buildings were heavily damaged when the tsunami struck, almost without warning, along the rim of the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra islands late on Saturday. Anak Krakatau had been spewing ash and lava for months before a 64-hectare (158-acre) section of its south-west side collapsed, an Indonesian official said. \u201cThis caused an underwater landslide and eventually caused the tsunami,\u201d said Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of the meteorological agency. Images captured by the European Space Agency\u2019s Sentinel-1 satellite showed a large portion of the southern flank of the volcano had slid off into the ocean, scientists said. The fact that the tsunami was triggered by a volcano rather than an earthquake meant no tsunami warning was triggered, scientists said. Coastal residents reported not seeing or feeling any warning signs before waves of up to three metres high surged in. Hundreds of military personnel and volunteers spent Monday scouring beaches strewn with debris in search of survivors. At least 1,459 people were injured and more than 600 homes, 60 shops and 420 vessels damaged when the tsunami struck. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the chief spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, said the country had no early warning system for landslides or volcanic eruptions. \u201cThe current early warning system is for earthquake activity,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cIndonesia must build an early warning system for tsunamis that are generated by underwater landslides and volcanic eruptions \u2026 Landslides triggered the 1992 Maumere tsunami and the Palu 2018 tsunami.\u201d He also said Indonesia\u2019s tsunami buoy network had not been operational since 2012. \u201cVandalism, a limited budget and technical damage mean there were no tsunami buoys at this time,\u201d Sutopo said. \u201cThey need to be rebuilt to strengthen the Indonesian tsunami early warning system. \u201cAnak Krakatau has been erupting since June 2018 until now. Yesterday\u2019s eruption was not the biggest. The October-November 2018 period had a larger eruption.\u201d The death toll is expected to rise as 128 people were still missing on Monday. At least 1,600 people have also been displaced. Dody Ruswandi, a senior official at the disaster agency, added that the rescue effort was likely to last a week. Sutopo warned locals to stay away from the coast. \u201cPeople should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,\u201d he told reporters. The University of Queensland volcanologist Teresa Ubide said Anak Krakatau had been erupting for the past few months, which was not unusual. \u201cIt seems like the volcano is active at the moment and it may happen again,\u201d Ubide said. \u201cThe volcano is very close to the shoreline so \u2026 there wouldn\u2019t be much time to warn because it\u2019s close and the tsunamis can travel very fast.\u201d The lack of seismic activity that would accompany an earthquake was also significant, she added. Richard Teeuw of the University of Portsmouth said sonar surveys were needed to map the seafloor around the volcano, but that work usually took months. \u201cThe likelihood of further tsunamis in the Sunda Strait will remain high while Anak Krakatau volcano is going through its current active phase, because that might trigger further submarine landslides,\u201d he said. Kathy Mueller from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said aid workers were helping evacuate injured people, bring in clean water and tarpaulins, and provide shelter. She said the group was preparing for the possibility of diseases breaking out in the tsunami zone, adding: \u201cThe situation, and the death toll, will remain fluid over the next days and even weeks.\u201d The water washed away an outdoor stage where a local rock band, Seventeen, were performing, killing their bassist and manager. Other people who had been watching the band on the beach were missing. Azki Kurniawan, 16, said his first warning about the tsunami was when people burst into the lobby of the Patra Comfort hotel shouting: \u201cSea water rising.\u201d Kurniawan, who was undergoing vocational training with a group of 30 other students, said he was confused because he had not felt a big earthquake. He said he ran to the car park to try to reach his motorbike but discovered it was already flooded. \u201cSuddenly, a one-metre wave hit me,\u201d he said, his eyes red and swollen from crying. \u201cI was thrown into the fence of a building about 30 metres from the beach and held on to the fence as strong as I could, trying to resist the water, which felt like it would drag me back into the sea. I cried in fear ... \u2018This is a tsunami?\u2019 I was afraid I would die.\u201d Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
