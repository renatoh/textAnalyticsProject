Afonso Alves and Mateja Kezman, deadly in Holland but regarded with considerable amusement in England after their nightmares at Middlesbrough and Chelsea respectively, have a lot to answer for. Alves and Kezman are the reason why Ronald Koeman\u2019s decision to bring Graziano Pell\u00e8 with him to Southampton was seen as a gamble. The Italian striker was brilliant for Koeman at Feyenoord last season but the task of replacing Rickie Lambert in Southampton\u2019s attack seemed like a tall order for a 29-year-old who started scoring only once he had left Serie A to play against the weaker defences in the Eredivisie. Yet no one is questioning Pell\u00e8 now; not after his sensational overhead kick against Queens Park Rangers earned Southampton a sixth successive victory and kept them three points behind Chelsea in second place. Charlie Austin had just snatched a classy but undeserved equaliser for the visitors when Dusan Tadic\u2019s header fell to Pell\u00e8 in the 68th minute and, although Steven Caulker seemed to have the situation under control, Pell\u00e8\u2019s blend of skill and athleticism brought more delight to Koeman. \u201cHe is learning fast,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cIn the first two weeks I told him: \u2018It\u2019s not Holland.\u2019 In Holland if you bring 70% of your physical effort you will win the battle. In the Premier League you have to bring more than 100%, and he\u2019s doing that. Then you see how good he is as an attacker. \u201cHe did a lot for me at Feyenoord. He scored a lot of goals but this one was amazing, how he scored and the moment in the game. It was 2-1, not 3-0 or 1-3. But apart from how he scores goals, what is important is the player and he has shown his qualities and we are happy to have him at Saints.\u201d Pell\u00e8, who said he often tries that move in training, is a burly, intelligent leader of the line and he already has five goals for his new club. \u201cI\u2019ve got experience enough now to realise where I am,\u201d Pell\u00e8 said. \u201cI have to be honest, it was not so easy in the beginning, but I was lucky I came to England a month before the start of the season, then I had a big time to adapt myself. \u201cAfter one or two games I realised that I needed to do more than what usually I did before in the past. If in Holland I gave up to 80%, here you have to give 110. All the games are difficult, all the teams, from the lowest to the top, are always good, good organisation, strong and fit. I don\u2019t like to find an excuse. I\u2019m really positive and I\u2019m happy.\u201d Just like everyone else at Southampton, whose players will receive a day off this week. Poor finishing meant that they made heavier work of it than they should have done against an unimpressive QPR but Southampton were always the better side, with Sadio Man\u00e9 excelling on his first league start and setting up Ryan Bertrand for the opening goal with a deft backheel, and they could have made it a seriously embarrassing return to St Mary\u2019s for an unusually despondent Harry Redknapp. The QPR manager is trying to see the positives but he sounded like he was going through the motions after another away defeat. \u201cWe stayed in the game,\u201d Redknapp said. \u201cThat was important. There is a lot of work to be done but there were some positives.\u201d Namely that they did not collapse after Bertrand\u2019s goal, equalising through Austin\u2019s volley, but there must be concern over how ragged QPR\u2019s defence is looking. Next for Southampton? A trip to White Hart Lane and a reunion with Mauricio Pochettino.
