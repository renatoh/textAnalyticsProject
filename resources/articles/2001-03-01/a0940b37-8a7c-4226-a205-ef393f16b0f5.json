The Blair government's public-private partnership (PPP) for the tube has been promoted and managed from the heart of Whitehall but has not been made to work as envisaged. Surely the time has come for open-minded reconsideration of prudent, locally accountable revenue bonds. They have a proven track record and would facilitate devolution. Labour has steadfastly refused to discuss a fall-back should the temporary privatisation of the tube fail: a miserable piece of amateur administration. High annual payments by the Treasury (or, more to the point, by the taxpayer) are now inevitable - so they ought to consider how these payments can be most effectively used. It was always open to the government simply to carry on with state ownership and direct grants while improving on the present (government-appointed) management. Another option would have been a return to the situation when the Greater London Council ran the tube: to hand it over to Mayor Ken Livingstone and Bob Kiley as a job lot, together with some kind of promise (hard to believe and unenforcable in practice) of year-by-year cash grants. Neither of these is attractive. The best plan is - still - to follow through the logic of devolving London' s government: hand the underground over to Kiley and Livingstone and allow the capital's elected leaders to take responsibility for its financing by issuing revenue bonds. Bonds ought to have a great future, whatever now happens in London. A revenue bond can be issued with the security of a dedicated stream of user fees, fares, grants or taxes; it would be sold through the private capital market system and bought by the investing public, whether private or institutional. An agreed level of government grant guaranteed over specified intervals would be necessary but for most public sector investment projects it is a reasonable request. Grant guarantees were necessary in any case under the original PPP. There is now the precedent of the seven-year commitment of government grant to the train-operating companies following the privatisation of British Rail. There need be no further recourse to local or national government guarantees of repayment. The chart shows the role of bonds of this kind in paying for investment in the New York subway. London's underground and other British transport operations produce considerable net revenues. Therefore a cash flow already exists to support the issue of revenue bonds in London and elsewhere. Outside London they could be used by the regional development agencies in projects where a revenue flow is in prospect. Issuing a bond imposes a healthy discipline: a clearly defined and distinct legal structure which has separate accounts, transparent statements of assets and liabilities, clear and enforcable objectives, a long-term capital plan with long-term financing commitments and a degree of isolation from day to day politics for the directors. It separates good management and procurement from efficient financing. In the US, local authorities or state governments create \"public benefit corporations\", allowing the public sector to retain control while separating the financing source and responsibility from the general activities of government. In the UK, a similar structure could be a trust. There are many precedents. Trusts were common in the 18th century as a means of funding and procuring local services - indeed they were the very beginnings of local government. Trusts can be effectively scrutinised. New York state government retains a firm control of the governance and, through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) board, the operation of public transport. MTA bonds are rated by Wall Street credit agencies and are sold in the private capital markets. The governor of New York state appoints the chair and several board members of the MTA. The mayor of New York city and officials of the suburban county governments in the region make other appointments to the board. The MTA prepares a 20-year statement of capital needs and from this formulates a five-year plan. This must be approved by the New York state legislature which sets a cap on the maximum volume of bonds to be issued for each five-year period. On some occasions, there are state-wide referendums about issuing a bond. Some have claimed that there were problems with bonds issued for refurbishing the New York subway. They confuse two entirely separate issues. The MTA, as a New York state government entity, has issued and repaid bonds successfully since 1982. It was New York city - a different thing - which faced difficulties back in 1975 with bond repayments. In the UK, the Treasury would have to give general consent if this type of financing were to proceed. But the UK will need significant investment if crumbling infrastructure is to be rebuilt. Scrutiny arrange ments and the discipline demanded by bond-holders would assure the chancellor as he let go of the purse-strings. He would please the financial markets, which are hungry for good bond issues. The squabble over the tube is simply a visible manifestation of a struggle between central and local government over how best to re-invest in the nation's capital stock. It surely cannot be right to have a handful of civil servants and ministers in Whitehall making all the decisions for the whole country. Revenue bonds, possibly subject to local referendums, offer a responsible - and local - solution. Are any parties in the market for a good manifesto idea? \u0095 Stephen Glaister is professor of transport at Imperial College, London and Tony Travers is director of the Greater London Group at the London School of Economics s.glaister@ic.ac.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
