Her break-out hit was the Ballets Russes\u2019s Le Coq D\u2019Or in 1914. Dancers in appliqued cotton or velvet were complemented by her city backdrop, a modernist fantasy of ancient Azerbaijan. Design icon \u2026 Critics spilled as much ink on Goncharova\u2019s designs as principal ballerina Tamara Karsavina\u2019s barefoot performance. Double bill \u2026 The original costumes were only seen for one season as they belonged to the production\u2019s sponsor. This illustration is for a revival in 1937. Threads \u2026 The move into costumes and later fashion seemed a natural one for Goncharova, whose chief influences included both modernist ideas and Tula province textiles. Factory girl \u2026 Goncharova\u2019s creations were made largely alone. Dressed in her preferred working attire of men\u2019s clothes, she grafted in a factory on Moscow\u2019s outskirts. Natalia Goncharova, Tate Modern, SE1, to 8 September"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
