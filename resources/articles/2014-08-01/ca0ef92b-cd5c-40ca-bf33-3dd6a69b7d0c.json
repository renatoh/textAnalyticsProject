From this vantage point each player appears to move like a puck across an air-hockey table, all warp speed and fluid movements. Getting a late ticket to a big match recently, I had to change this routine. Watching from the upper concourse it was striking how the players take on an altogether different appearance from this elevated perspective. From high in the stands the sense of individual player movement was lost in the vast expanses of the ground, and was replaced by a greater awareness of the non-stop movement of each player\u2019s limbs in all directions, like an upended insect flailing trying to right itself. Everywhere, players were pointing at each other, gesturing where to run, indicating who to man up on, giving advice and signalling what team-mates were doing right and wrong. There were more people giving directions on the field than in the air traffic controllers\u2019 room during peak hour at Heathrow. It seemed that everyone out there thought they were running the show. And maybe that\u2019s fair enough. After all, that\u2019s what leadership is about in modern football, no matter what the code. From the grizzled veteran to the debutant teenager with acne and patchy facial hair, each and every player seems to have a leadership role of some description. Football playing lists being populated entirely by members of generations X and Y, famed for their need for constant positive reinforcements and affirmations of their value, has led to a growing number of players being given leadership titles at clubs. A decade ago football clubs appointed a captain, vice-captain, and maybe a deputy vice-captain if the coaching staff were feeling generous. This leadership coterie has now given way to the leadership group, along with all its attendant roles. There are the team captains, co-captains, deputies, third in charge, backline leaders, forwardline leaders, midfield leaders, community leaders, players\u2019 representatives, emerging leaders, person responsible for checking that players\u2019 hair has been satisfactorily coiffed ahead of highly televised matches, the bloke in charge of making sure players\u2019 iPods are fully charged, and so the list goes on. If a player can tie his laces without falling over, then he comes into reckoning for leadership calculations. If he can answer a journalist\u2019s question without sending the club\u2019s media manager into cardiac arrest, then he qualifies, no deserves, an Official Title at his football club. Besides keeping the makers of honour boards and gold paint in business, it\u2019s hard to identify the benefits to many of these accessory leadership positions. I prefer the old-school model where a captain is the primary leadership figure on a club\u2019s playing list and he retains that role until his retirement. A team follow one man into battle each week and everyone knows who the top dog is. Nowadays at many clubs we\u2019re left with a litter of pups, all barking discordantly at each other on game day, struggling for attention, gesticulating wildly like a group of hyperactive traffic cops. The problem with distributing leadership amongst a large group of players is that each extra slice of the leadership pie leaves less for everyone else, diminishing the very pretence of leadership. The corporate speak of empowering players and generating ownership misses this crucial point. Leadership has previously been associated with prestige and an elevation from the general playing group, but it is now possible for over half the players on the field at any one time to hold some form of leadership position at a club. The emphasis placed on leadership groups and the value placed on the collaborative input of all players diminishes the significance that was once associated with the role of captain. To my eye the on-field responsibilities of a football captain on match day have not become so onerous as to require multiple designated leadership positions. I wonder what the great captains of the past would make of current state of affairs. I dare say many would prefer to handle the reins in their own right, without having input from all and sundry. Certainly the on-field role of a captain in most football codes is comparatively easier than the tasks performed by the captains in some other sports. A cricket captain is responsible for important decisions that can determine the outcome of a match. By contrast, it can be argued that a football captain\u2019s greatest on-field responsibility is to toss the coin at the start of the match, and point in the direction the wind is blowing if it falls his way. The rise of the ever expanding leadership group leaves me wondering, if everyone is a leader on a team\u2019s playing list, who is left to do the following? Perhaps the only place football clubs want followers is on Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
