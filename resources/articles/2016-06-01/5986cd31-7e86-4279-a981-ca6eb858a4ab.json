Rosemary Rimmer-Clay, who was a 19-year-old student at Dundee University in 1975 at a time when he was rector of the university, said that a man who she had once viewed as a hero had abused his power to prey on young girls. After he had invited her to join him for a coffee following a meeting at a Burns Night supper, she said that he \u201clunged\u201d at her in her flat after cooking an omelette for her. \u201cI said to him \u2018this is not a good idea, my sister teaches your daughter\u2019,\u201d she told ITV News. \u201cHe was horrified and he kind of backed off and then he came in a little bit again and said \u2018at least give me a kiss\u2019, and I was thinking this is vile I don\u2019t want to give him a kiss but he had me in a corner. \u201cAnd then he gave me this horrible slobbery kiss with his tongue and literally I had never been kissed by anyone. And I thought it was a really horrible experience.\u201d Describing the incident as \u201cstraightforward abuse\u201d, Rimmer-Clay, 62, said that the incident had left her feeling \u201crepulsed and numb and shocked\u201d. \u201cI saw him as someone who was a representative of the university \u2026 he was a national wit and an author, but he was abusing his power to prey on young girls,\u201d she said in an interview, which was broadcast on Monday. She said that she did not report the incident to Dundee University or the police. The Metropolitan police have been examining a statement from one of the women who has alleged that Freud was a paedophile who preyed on her for 10 years. Sylvia Woosley said in the ITV documentary Exposure, which was broadcast last week, that Freud groomed and abused her from the age of 10 until she was 19. Woosley, now in her 70s, appears in the documentary in obvious distress to allege that Freud took away her childhood. Clement Freud\u2019s widow, Jill Freud, who is now 89, said in a statement after viewing the documentary that she was \u201cshocked, deeply saddened and profoundly sorry for what has happened to these women \u2026 I sincerely hope they will now have some peace\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
