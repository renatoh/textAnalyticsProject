Now it appears that it is the artistic community's turn to fuel the restless search for ever more ingenious products. More and more companies are sending their employees on courses to study the arts - both painterly and dramatic - in the hope that this will revitalise jaded but creative minds. The ICI-owned consultancy Quest International reckons that by studying the works of great artists, by undertaking \"artistic expeditions\" to monuments such as the Ice Hotel in Sweden or by immersing their sometimes-naked bodies in watery venues such as the thalassotherapy salt water centre at Le Touquet, France, their flavourists and perfumers were inspired to new and dizzying heights of invention, resulting in a plethora of brand-new toothpaste flavours and scents being born on their return. \"We've been amazed at the depth of the cross-fertilisation between the act of painting and the creation of new toothpaste flavours,\" says Martin Holme, Quest's creative director, who lists African tribal dancing and didgeridoo-playing among his other techniques for encouraging coagulated creative juices to flow. \"And some of the new flavours and smells that have resulted from our trip to Sweden are now in research.\" Expenses-paid trips to foreign parts may sound like little more than company jollies, but the head of the Creative Knowledge consultancy, Peter Feroze, would beg to differ. His consultancy was founded in association with the London Royal Academy of Arts and encourages its blue-chip clients to explore their artistic side in order to come up with innovative ideas for their businesses, and he says the search for a top-selling product is always difficult. \"The biggest fear that staff have is that they aren't themselves artistic,\" he says. The consultants ask people to make sketches and take photographs while they are away, and then to recreate what they have seen in paintings of their own when they get home. In this way, claims Feroze, \"It is possible to draw out subconscious feelings about how they see themselves and how they view the challenges at work.\" One Quest flavourist studied two pictures of water-lilies by Claude Monet and reported that she \"could not sleep that night for thinking about how I could use the pictures to interpret a flavour\". However, while her suggestions of toothpaste with a hint of ginger, vanilla or fruit cocktail are now being analysed by technical bods back home, her fascination for liquorice, treacle and chocolate notes may be a little too far out for current tastes. Feroze admits that when it was first suggested that the scientists should further corporate interest by shrugging off their white coats for a few days and stay in a hotel made entirely of ice in the remote Jukkas Jarvi region of northern Sweden, sceptical guffaws could be heard throughout the lab. Yet, he says, so impressed are these same scientists by the creative inspiration that the trip has given them that staff have now suggested a \"Dirty Expedition\" which involves living rough in the country, without soap or toothpaste for five days, in order to \"renew their own thoughts about the significance and importance of freshness and oral health\". Feroze rejects the suggestion that Monet would turn in his grave at the notion that his artistry was being used for the mundane commercial purpose of flogging more toothpaste. \"I think he would be utterly fascinated by what Quest is doing,\" he says. He agrees that Britain's appetite for art in general is a little underdeveloped. Nevertheless, he insists that \"we all have an artistic side - even the country's top business people - and no company can afford to turn down the opportunity to bring out the hidden talents of its staff. \"The idea of these expeditions is to take people out of their usual work context and to inspire them through new experiences involving mental and physical stimuli. Who's to say it shouldn't work just as well for people who invent toothpaste flavours as for anybody else?\" he says. Elsewhere, companies are hoping that drama will allow employees to loosen their stays and find the innovative and inventive child within. Thankfully though, the fashion for role-playing during in-house training is giving way to the recognition that putting staff on the spot can be counterproductive. Consultancy firm Steps Drama believes that this common technique in business training - in which one participant is often in a position to humiliate the other - can be destructive for the participants. Rather than expecting employees to act out a situation in front of colleagues, Steps provides professional actors to play all the parts; allowing the staff to concentrate on learning from the dramatic tableau before them, rather than worrying about how they themselves are going to give an Oscar-winning portrayal of \"angry man on telephone\". Steps marketing director Angela McHale says: \"All business training sessions have the capacity to get personal and emotional; some people may be on a difficult journey at work and may take everything to heart. By providing professional actors to do the difficult bit of creating lifelike characters and acting out typical scenes, the pressure to perform is thankfully diverted away from staff.\" But remember - it'll be back on once you return to the office, allegedly refreshed and supposedly raring to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
