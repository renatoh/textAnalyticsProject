By the same measure, the president craves the adulation of the press the way a junkie hankers for a wakeup fix. Trump denounces the New York Times as \u201cfailing\u201d and \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d, but yearns for Maggie Haberman\u2019s approval. No mommy issues there. Enter CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, Trump\u2019s on-air sparring partner, with a book entitled \u2026 The Enemy of the People. Trump\u2019s presidency is about trashing constitutionally imposed checks and balances, dumping on the first amendment, sating the cravings of social conservatives and race-baiting. Acosta\u2019s brand is about getting into Trump\u2019s face and under his skin. Acosta cops to \u201cgrandstanding\u201d, \u201cshowboating\u201d and, on occasion, \u201copt[ing] for the bait\u201d. For such efforts, the White House stripped Acosta of his press pass, which was restored after a successful legal challenge. Acosta\u2019s book sheds real light on the West Wing funhouse. It explains how the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d emerged as a mainstay of Trump\u2019s lexicon: blame it on Steve Bannon. Acosta also catches Jared Kushner, the first son-in-law, lying through his teeth from the get-go. Acosta reports meeting Kushner at the White House in the aftermath of Michael Flynn being dismissed as national security adviser. Kushner calls Acosta \u201cthe fake news guy\u201d, then is asked why he calls CNN fake news. \u201cThe Russia story, he responded. \u2018There\u2019s nothing to it.\u2019\u201d As Acosta puts it: \u201cThat was not true. Not by a long shot.\u201d Kushner\u2019s name appears in both volumes and on 47 pages of Robert Mueller\u2019s report. But then again, Kushner wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near the West Wing or holding a security clearance in a normal administration, let alone be tasked with bringing peace to the Middle East. Acosta also depicts a \u201ctipsy\u201d Reince Priebus, then head of the Republican National Committee, telling the author very early on election morning it was \u201cgoing to take a miracle for us to win\u201d. As the CNN man put it, Priebus \u201cjust walked up in a bit of stupor and uttered those unbelievable words. So, I let him talk.\u201d And to think, Priebus\u2019s ex-boss is a teetotaler. Compared to its predecessors in the realm of the Trump expos\u00e9, The Enemy of the People lacks the acid-dripping punch of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury and Siege, the granularity of Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear and the salaciousness of Stormy Daniels\u2019 Full Disclosure. In a universe already cluttered by \u201ctell-alls\u201d by administration alumni and discards like Omarosa, Spicey and the Mooch, the bar is high for whatever comes next. Unfortunately, Acosta\u2019s quotes and anecdotes are frequently sourced to unnamed White House officials and political insiders. For example, we are told that at least one member of the administration views Trump as \u201cinsane\u201d and another sees him as potentially \u201ccompromised\u201d by the Russians. On such topics, Acosta glides across well-tilled ground. Last September, an anonymous op-ed in the New York Times boasted of active resistance to Trump within his own administration. Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state, reportedly denounced his boss as a \u201cmoron\u201d. Trump has proclaimed himself a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d. Acosta acknowledges Trump\u2019s working class base and captures the shock that reverberated with his upset win. But he fails to place the rage and resentment in the larger context of how America and the west reached this inflection point. Unlike Hillary Clinton, Trump was not just a candidate. He embodied a movement. Like it or not. Trump, Nigel Farage, Matteo Salvini, Viktor Orban and Benjamin Netanyahu are on stage at the same moment. Grievance toward elites and immigration are themes with ready audiences on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond. And yes, Acosta should address all this after he tacitly cops to acting like an advocate or editorialist, as opposed to simply reporting breaking news or calling balls and strikes. In his words: \u201cNeutrality for the sake of neutrality doesn\u2019t really serve us in the age of Trump.\u201d Lest Acosta forget, Edward R Murrow\u2019s takedown of Joe McCarthy and Walter Cronkite\u2019s editorial on the Vietnam war carried sway because Murrow and Cronkite possessed gravitas and credibility. They also respected boundaries and lines. When Paul LePage, Maine\u2019s then-governor, told an interviewer \u201cour constitution is not only broken, but we need a Donald Trump to show some authoritarian power in our country\u201d, he was speaking for an audience larger than himself or even Trump. A majority of the GOP now believes the press is the enemy of the people, more than two-in-five Republicans think the president should be able to shutter media outlets for \u201cbad behavior\u201d, and a similar number cast a kind eye towards Russia and Vladimir Putin. During the 2016 campaign, Trump made NBC\u2019s Katy Tur a foil and focal point. In the end Tur had a passel of death threats and a security detail to show for it, but only after Trump had telephoned her and, sounding like a stalker or mob boss, said: \u201cBe fair to me Katy \u2026 you and I should be friends.\u201d Nothing has changed. Trump still expects the media to bow, scrape and be co-opted. To give him his due, Acosta refuses to do that. With 2020, the Mueller report and the specter of impeachment all hovering before us, don\u2019t expect a kinder, gentler Trump. The latest iteration of the indictment against Julian Assange places a bullseye on the back of a free press. In May, from Japan, Trump tweeted: \u201c\u2018Why doesn\u2019t the press apologize to President Trump for the Russian Collusion Delusion?\u2019 \u2026 How about the Dems also?\u201d Things will get worse before they get worse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
