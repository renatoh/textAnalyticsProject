United were vibrant and collectively unselfish as they stormed the Fulham goal in one of the most aggressive and coherent first quarters of a Premiership match that we have ever seen. Using width to stretch their opponents, United moved the ball fast from back to front. All areas of the team showed a clear understanding. The full-backs spread wide quickly to receive possession from Rio Ferdinand, Wes Brown or Edwin van der Sar. When Heidar Helguson and Collins John got wide to hold up the full-backs, Paul Scholes - it was wonderful to see him return in such impish and incisive form - dropped back, with John O'Shea his warder, to receive the ball and link. As a result, they dragged Fulham's Pape Bouba Diop and Jimmy Bullard away from defensive areas. But it was from the middle to the front where United excelled, their attacks propelled by speed of movement, changes of direction and early one-touch football. Although Fulham set out with a brave 4-4-2 and had two banks of four when possession was lost, they could not contain the sheer will and drive of United to get the ball into their front players who then knocked it back for the midfielders to spray it early into wide positions. Antti Niemi, a goalkeeper who works from his line rather than controlling his box, could only watch as wicked balls flew across his penalty box and life for the visitors became more and more difficult. United maximised their wing play, but it was the determination to get into the box - not just by Wayne Rooney and Louis Saha, but by the opposite flank player when the ball was on the far side - which ripped Fulham to shreds. That was a feature of their play. Saha's back-header found Giggs inside the box and he drove the ball back for the Frenchman's first goal to set the pattern. It was Saha himself who drove across the box for Rooney's goal, and Ronaldo's position for the fourth on 19 minutes was a great example of a wide player getting into the box rather than holding back in the hope that the full-back will clear the ball for him to pick up possession. United's wide men were under clear instruction to flood the penalty area and Ronaldo's fourth was the icing on a glorious first 20 minutes. Many have been hit by a blitzkrieg at Old Trafford before. My last game at Sheffield Wednesday took a similar pattern: 4-0 down within minutes, we tried to hold the fort thereafter but still lost 6-1. It can be a nightmare and this was the worst possible early season result for Coleman, but he should not be too upset. This was an incredibly exciting performance by United and for Sir Alex, whose dream must be now to retire in glory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
