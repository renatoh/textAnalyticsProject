Midsomer Murders notoriously came under fire two years ago when its producer, Brian True-May, was suspended for saying that black faces were not right for his popular village mystery series, while Inspector Morse and its prime-time successor Lewis are dominated by white leading characters. Until now. The new sidekick to take his place in the Oxfordshire police car alongside Lewis is to be played by Gambian actor Babou Ceesay. The character of DC Alex Gray, who will be introduced to viewers this month, will put the Lewis franchise on a fresh footing, though Ceesay said he had been unaware of the race row until he appeared on set. \"When I started working on the show I was told about the controversy surrounding Midsomer Murders as an ethnic-free zone,\" he said. \"But I don't think my role in Lewis is political. I don't think they were 'going black' for the part, as the industry phrase goes.\" But the actor, who was most recently seen in the BBC4 sitcom Getting On, agrees that his casting is a positive step: \"It can't be a bad thing, although in acting you can't get away from the fact that your colour and age and gender will affect you. It is a naturally prejudiced business.\" The show, he said, will ignore his colour, something which he finds \"quite refreshing. The statement is that I am there and I am black. There is no need for them to say anything else.\" Growing up in Africa, he was part of a black majority, so race was never an issue. \"At the beginning in Britain, perhaps, I did wonder why I was not getting the opportunity to try this or to try that,\" he said. He believes that the situation is improving, with a greater variety of work on offer. \"It is a lot more interesting now because there is more 'blind casting' going on,\" he said. \"In the beginning there were only a couple of times per annum when I would be called for a part that was not necessarily black, but it has increased. That might be partly because I am more experienced now, though. Agents, casting directors and the big decision-makers in the industry seem to entertain the idea of experimenting.\" Last year British black actor David Harewood, star of Homeland, created controversy by suggesting he had to go to America to land a lead role. Ceesay followed the debate: \"I have watched David's career and I love his work, but I have a slightly different view. I do agree with him that the size of the industry out there makes a difference. But it is more competitive there, too. He was in a very big series, but I know several good black actors who are struggling out there.\" The role of Lewis star Kevin Whately's sidekick has been played by Laurence Fox and both actors will appear in Ceesay's first episode. Fox joked recently that he had grown weary of asking suspects to explain their movements on the previous day, but Ceesay is eager to pick up the police notebook. \"I love detective dramas and am looking forward to asking all those questions. At the beginning, though, my character is a bit squeamish. DC Gray is quite clumsy and anxious and finds it hard to badger people. He has to work in a different way to Laurence.\" He describes Gray as \"a kind of geography teacher type in terms of his dress sense \u2013 with patches on his jacket elbows\". The character also has a hidden history to be gradually revealed in the series. The actor already knows Oxford, as he went to drama school there, but realises Lewis's loyal viewers may take time to get used to him: \"I imagine they will see me as more of a guest at first.\" Whately, he added, had made him welcome. The actor, who starred in the original Morse series with John Thaw, had stopped him from feeling overwhelmed: \"People told me that Kevin was going to be one of the loveliest men I would ever work with, and it turns out to be true.\" The 34-year-old's route into acting is unconventional. After university he worked as a risk consultant at the accounting firm Deloitte in London. \"I went for the straight and narrow and got a job and a house, and then I got the itch and had to act.\" So, after studying how British \"people carry themselves and talk\" by watching Inspector Morse as a schoolboy and admiring \"the architecture and the greenery\", he now takes his place in that world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
