The 31-year-old has lived with her two sons in the same gray shingled duplex in a majority-black neighborhood for years. Yet when the Guardian told her her name was one of one in 14 Wisconsin voters at risk of being removed from the voter rolls for potentially having changed addresses, Ellis was surprised. \u201cI still live here. That\u2019s not right,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery vote is supposed to count.\u201d Approximately 232,000 Wisconsin voters are on this list after being identified by a complex matching system. In 2016, Donald Trump won the presidential election in Wisconsin by 22,748 votes, or less than 1%. A new Guardian analysis has found voters in zip codes that were predominantly black or heavily populated by students were nearly twice as likely to be flagged for removal. These populations are also more likely to vote Democrat. The Guardian also interviewed 100 people on the list and found that over a third either hadn\u2019t moved at all, or had moved locally. Many were unaware they had to re-register. \u201cThe right to vote could be taken away, regardless of who you are or where you live,\u201d said Megan Gall, national data director for All Voting is Local, an advocacy group. \u201cEligible voters should never get kicked off the registration rolls.\u201d The Covid-19 pandemic is adding further complications. Wisconsin and other states are now pushing mail-in balloting rather than voting in person. But if voters are erroneously dropped from the rolls, they might never receive those ballots in the first place. In 2016, Wisconsin joined the Electronic Registration Information Center (Eric), a multi-state partnership that helps its members keep their voter rolls current by comparing data between government sources such as the post office and Department of Motor Vehicles, to see who might have moved home. A year later, Wisconsin deactivated roughly 308,000 registrations, but eventually, the state reinstated approximately 7,000 voters who were erroneously struck off. In 2019, the state decided it wouldn\u2019t remove voters from the rolls until 2021, to avoid making the same mistake before this year\u2019s presidential election. Yet in November, the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty (Will), a conservative non-profit law firm, sued the Wisconsin elections commission, claiming it violated state law by putting off the cancellations. The removals have so far continued to be blocked, but Will is asking the Wisconsin supreme court to hear the case before the election. Will\u2019s president, Rick Esenberg, has argued that the process won\u2019t disenfranchise voters because they can register at the polls on election day. But in-person voting may be hampered by the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis Will lawsuit says: let\u2019s deactivate these people immediately and get them to register again. But that defeats the whole purpose,\u201d said Reid Magney, a spokesman for the Wisconsin election commission. \u201cThe more people who have to re-register on election day, the longer the lines are.\u201d The zip code in Wisconsin where voters had the greatest odds of being put on the list of potential movers was composed entirely of student housing for the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Here, one in four voters, who are likely to vote Democrat, got a mover letter from the state. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to see why college students \u2013 who have notoriously unstable addresses while they are in school, often changing one or more times a year \u2013 would be flagged,\u201d said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at UW-Madison. This can lead to confusion. Tommaso Tonelli, a 20-year-old sophomore at the university who was flagged by the Eric system, didn\u2019t know how to update his address. \u201cThere are certain places I can go on campus, I\u2019m pretty sure,\u201d he guessed. Wylie Boelter wasn\u2019t sure why he was on the list. \u201cI mean, I moved to a different place, but still in Madison,\u201d he said. Having to re-register could prove an obstacle for student voters. Under the state\u2019s current law, students can use a school ID to register to vote only if it meets certain criteria. If they use a student ID, they have to provide additional documentation. Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser at the Democracy Fund, a non-partisan organization focused on election administration, said students are stuck in a residency grey area. \u201cThey\u2019re often able to register to vote but may not be required to get a driver\u2019s license in that state, meaning they may lack the identification necessary to vote.\u201d Areas populated by black voters had the second-highest rates of voters being flagged for removal, according to the Guardian\u2019s analysis. Twelve per cent of voters in majority-black zip codes were at risk of removal, compared with 7% of voters statewide. But about a third of the 37 voters interviewed in these areas said they hadn\u2019t moved. All of these zip codes were in Milwaukee, where African Americans make up nearly 40% of the population. The city plays a critical role in elections: high turnout there helped Barack Obama win the state twice, and low turnout contributed to Trump\u2019s success in 2016, said David Canon, a political science professor at UW-Madison. Kenneth Dixon, 57, who was also flagged, said he has never moved out of his neighborhood. But he wasn\u2019t surprised that those in his predominantly black Milwaukee zip code, were likely to be on the list. \u201cSo that is how they are trying to win the election for the Republicans?\u201d he said. \u201cAin\u2019t that a coincidence.\u201d Kyesha Rembert, whose zip code is 94% black, registered to vote at her cousin\u2019s home, where she has lived for three years after losing her job. Yet her mail is sent to her mom\u2019s address nearby. When she went to vote in a local election in February, she was told by a poll worker that her name was flagged. Though she was allowed to vote, she was left confused. \u201cI vote in every election, so I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m on the strike list,\u201d she said. Socioeconomic factors in some of these neighborhoods mean that some residents are more likely to change addresses. Rembert\u2019s zip code has one of the nation\u2019s highest incarceration rates and two-thirds of children live in poverty, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in 2018. \u201cYou are affecting a population that is already, in some cases, a more vulnerable population on so many levels,\u201d Canon said. \u201cMaking them less likely to be able to vote is just not something that should be tolerated.\u201d While Wisconsin\u2019s method of maintaining voter rolls can be reliable, its margin of error could mean tens of thousands of voter registrations are wrongfully deactivated. \u201cThe timing of this is the critical thing. You don\u2019t want to be doing this in the months leading up to the presidential election,\u201d Canon said. \u201cIf you do a purge like this on a big scale, you\u2019re gonna catch 10,000 to 15,000 people that shouldn\u2019t have been removed.\u201d Though the state hasn\u2019t deactivated anyone on the list yet, the back-and-forth of the Will lawsuit could still discourage voters. Zina Noel, a student from a majority-black community in Milwaukee, said she has had trouble voting and getting absentee ballots from the state for years. Noel, who is pursuing her PhD, has moved between universities such as Harvard, and technically should be allowed to vote from her permanent address at her parents\u2019 house. But when she got the letter about losing her registration status, it was the final straw. \u201cIt seems fitting that there would be a big purge of voters in mostly Democratic and black areas,\u201d Noel said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you live in the black part of Wisconsin.\u201d She registered instead in Minnesota, where she is living for only few months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
