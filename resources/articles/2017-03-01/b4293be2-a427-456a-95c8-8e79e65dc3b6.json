Having spent the buildup suggesting Chelsea play a more defensive style of football than under his stewardship, and that the Premier League leaders have benefited from a lack of European football, all that frustration that has simmered since the 4-0 humiliation here in October came pouring out. The pair do not know each other well but there is needle already to their relationship. The fourth official, Mike Jones, found himself sandwiched as they screamed at each other, an exchange which made Mourinho airing his post-mach complaint into the Italian\u2019s ear back in the autumn feel tame. Conte had previously been unflappable all season. Mourinho has got under his skin. 2) Mourinho is no longer Special in these parts He had the same effect on some of those who recently worshipped him. The Manchester United manager, Mourinho, was already convinced Chelsea\u2019s players were going to ground too eagerly when he reacted furiously as Eden Hazard crumpled under Paul Pogba\u2019s challenge, demanding sanction from the officials. A section of the home support, fans who used to love his tantrums, immediately showered the Portuguese with abuse, to which he responded by pointing at the pitch and showing them three fingers for the trio of titles he won while at Stamford Bridge. That gesture was repeated before the interval as the chants \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re not special any more\u201d and \u201cJudas\u201d \u2013 flared at every flashpoint. The makeup of the home support may differ slightly for FA Cup fixtures but the sentiment was clear. Chelsea have moved on. 3) Real Madrid will have been on goalkeeper watch Arguably the two best goalkeepers in England were on show, players whose performances have drawn covetous glances from Real Madrid. Thibaut Courtois, who had benefited from Conte ditching his policy of playing Asmir Begovic in cup games, conjured a fine block to deny Marcus Rashford but David de Gea found life more frantic. The Spaniard reacted superbly to turn away Eden Hazard\u2019s low attempt early on, a save made all the more remarkable by the shot flicking off Matteo Darmian en route. Real will have taken note. 4) Pogba powerless to halt stampeding Kant\u00e9 The simplistic theory doing the rounds goes that Leicester bought the Premier League for \u00a35.6m and Chelsea have now done likewise for nearer \u00a332m. Kant\u00e9\u2019s goal, his second against United this season, capped a trademark performance where he bullied bigger men off the ball and stampeded around the pitch tirelessly. Yet his display was made to look all the more impressive by his compatriot Paul Pogba\u2019s inability to wrest any control for the visitors. United\u2019s \u00a389m signing had started well enough and was badly hindered by Ander Herrera\u2019s dismissal but this team is still entitled to demand more than he is supplying at present. He has the physique, the ability and the presence but to witness him surrendering possession so easily \u2013 and often in dangerous areas \u2013 must privately infuriate his manager, particularly with Kant\u00e9 showing what United could have had. 5) Chelsea have Double vision Carlo Ancelotti achieved Chelsea\u2019s only Premier League and FA Cup Double in his first season in charge at Stamford Bridge. Now Conte, his compatriot and friend, can aspire to emulating that feat. This was a significant victory, for all that United will bemoan Hazard\u2019s collapse to earn Herrera his second caution. The visitors have been transformed since losing here in the league and, while depleted by injury and suspension, had not arrived daunted. The ferocity with which they began the contest demonstrated as much, and few teams have tested Chelsea on home territory like this of late. But Chelsea\u2019s momentum remains intact, their two-pronged assault on silverware edging closer to fruition. They have now gone 12 games unbeaten against these opponents, and the holders are out. Conte can sense reward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
