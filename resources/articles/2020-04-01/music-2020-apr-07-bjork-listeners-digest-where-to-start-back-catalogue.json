It is both accessible and wildly experimental, and, for a record that spawned a hit as massive as her cover of It\u2019s Oh So Quiet, it is resolutely unique and strange, always existing at the intersection of art and pop. She wrote the record after moving to London, and, while it shares some of its predecessor\u2019s affection for trip-hop and house music, it has a harder edge and hints at darker nights. In the techno-tinged pop sludge of Army of Me and Enjoy, you can see the origins of what would become an enduring fascination with digital technology. But it carries itself lightly in places, too, and is frequently gorgeous and glorious, particularly when it comes to the storytelling. Hyperballad is a folk tale of anxiety and love; Isobel ushers itself along string-laden beats to weave a wonderful fable of a clash between the ancient and modern; and Possibly Maybe is as sparse and minimal as Bj\u00f6rk gets, stripped to its bare bones, and astonishingly beautiful with it. The three to check out next Homogenic (One Little Indian, 1997) This masterpiece remains Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s greatest and most cogent record to date. Her first two albums had hopped around sounds, trying things on and shrugging them off, but Homogenic settles into an epic orchestral feel that marries itself to skittering, aggressive beats. Encountering a Bj\u00f6rk record for the first time always leaves the feeling of never quite having heard anything like it before, but that is never more true than here, where the music pulls between icy and warm, robotic and natural. It is also drily funny at times, for which Bj\u00f6rk rarely gets credit. \u201cI thought I could organise freedom / How Scandinavian of me,\u201d she belts out, on the pounding military march of Hunter. Vespertine (One Little Indian, 2001) After Homogenic came a softening, and Vespertine, dealing with love and desire, is Bj\u00f6rk at her most beautiful. She finds new textures in her voice, and its acrobatics are less flashy and more delicate, against an intricate world conjured up out of harps, music boxes and the clavichord. Among non-fans, there can be a perception that Bj\u00f6rk is, at times, hard work, that her experiments in sound can be a chore to listen to, but this is simply sublime. Biophilia (One Little Indian, 2011) The interplay between nature and technology, a longstanding concern, became explicit on this album \u201cabout the universe\u201d, which was also released as a series of apps and turned into an educational programme to help teach schoolchildren about science. Bells and whistles aside, this is underrated in the Bj\u00f6rk canon, and is packed with gems, from the dubstep-ish banger Crystalline, to the majesty of Virus, all wrapped around mind-bending, otherworldly time signatures. The remix album, Bastards, is also well worth tracking down. One for the heads Live Box (One Little Indian, 2003) Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s live shows are ever-shifting experiences \u2013 you never know if you\u2019ll get a full orchestra, a giant musical Tesla coil or a 12-strong flute club. This box set made a live album each out of shows around her first four records, plus a short bonus DVD, and it stands as a testament to the fact that she has long been one of the finest and most mesmerising performers in the world.

Power., by Adrian Deevoy This now infamous, very 90s cover of Q magazine got PJ Harvey, Tori Amos and Bj\u00f6rk together for a very 90s music-press chat (\u201cWould you spill their pint?\u201d). Some of it hasn\u2019t aged well, but, as a portrait of Bj\u00f6rk in the early stages of her solo career, it has the curiosity factor, and it is a reminder of just how rapid her rise to fame was with Debut. \u201cI guess I was lucky in that I became a public property in Iceland when I was 11, so I had 15 years of hardcore rehearsals before all of this hullabaloo,\u201d she said. The Invisible Woman: A Conversation with Bj\u00f6rk, by Jessica Hopper In this wide-ranging interview around the devastating yet restorative 2015 album Vulnicara, Bj\u00f6rk broached the personal loss that inspired the record, and once again addressed the issue of male collaborators being credited with her arrangements and production. \u201cI want to support young girls who are in their 20s now and tell them: You\u2019re not just imagining things. It\u2019s tough. Everything that a guy says once, you have to say five times.\u201d \u2018People miss the jokes. A lot of it is taking the piss out of myself\u2019, by Miranda Sawyer The playfulness in Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s work is often passed over, so it is wonderful to see her optimism and humour brought out in this Utopia-era interview. Sawyer nails the point that Bj\u00f6rk has \u201cworked in music for more than 30 years, so she\u2019s called a pop star. But really, she\u2019s an artist in disguise.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
