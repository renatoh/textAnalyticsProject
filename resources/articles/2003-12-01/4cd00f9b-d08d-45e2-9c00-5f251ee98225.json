I wouldn't go along with the general feeling that it's time for him to go but the pressure now is obviously greater than ever. By losing at home to Bolton on Wednesday, Liverpool blew arguably their best chance of a trophy. The minimum requirement for G\u00e9rard this season is silverware or a Champions League place, and it would be almost criminal if his team didn't get fourth spot in a Premiership such as this. I think it's between them and Newcastle for that position, which makes their game at St James' Park tomorrow all the more massive, and I've got to go for Liverpool after tipping them to win the title. Just finishing fourth, though, won't necessarily convince people that G\u00e9rard should keep his job, particularly if he hasn't won the FA Cup or Uefa Cup. It's how they get there that will be important. If they finish the season with a blaze, people will look forward to the start of the next campaign with optimism. If they limp over the line there are certain to be strong calls for a change. There'll be those now but I'm sure Liverpool will, quite rightly, ignore that. G\u00e9rard should be given at least until the end of the season. If then the club's objectives haven't been met and the board know someone such as Martin O'Neill would take the job, I think they'd find it very hard to stick with the French man, although I bet they'd ask him to take a role such as general manager. As the flak flies today, it's a fair bet G\u00e9rard will be thinking to himself that his record at Liverpool has been pretty good. He's delivered his share of trophies, including three in one season, and I'm not sure he's been given the credit he deserves, but it's the elusive league championship everyone's talking about and they're no closer to that. G\u00e9rard's been given a good amount to spend and I wonder whether he might been better off investing it differently. He's spread the money on getting numbers to bolster the squad when he might have been better buying two or three top-range players and bringing up others alongside them. Liverpool have quite a few functional players who are prepared to work very hard but I wonder whether the club should have gone for fewer signings and got that bit of extra class. People such as Salif Diao, Djimi Traor\u00e9, Bruno Cheyrou, El Hadji Diouf and Milan Baros are all OK and may become better but if Liverpool put them on the market - admittedly a market which is a different kettle of fish now - would people be knocking doors down to sign them? I've felt for a while they could do with somebody with a bit of genius about him who can change things with one pass. Whether Rivaldo is still up to it I don't know, but a player of that ilk may be the spark they need. It always surprised me how sparingly G\u00e9rard used Jari Litmanen, possibly the most creative player Liverpool have had since Kenny Dalglish. You wonder whether he trusts that sort of player. I think sometimes you have to. The way Liverpool have tended to play probably hasn't helped G\u00e9rard in how he's regarded. This season they've been more adventurous and better to watch but I still feel they lack invention. When you're functional and winning trophies, people say you're being effective. When it stops being effective people are quick to criticise. What I wouldn't criticise is the signing of Harry Kewell. He's settled in well and been excellent but I don't think it reflects well on the squad Houllier's built that Dietmar Hamann's so badly missed when he's injured. The protection he offers the defence is vital, especially now there's more adventure in the team and no really reliable central defensive partnership. Steven Gerrard's not at his best in that role because you want him surging forward. It's a reason why Liverpool have been up and down but it can't be an excuse for a club of that size. G\u00e9rard might regret not using the likes of Hamann, Gerrard and Kewell from the start against Bolton but he'll prepare to face Newcastle knowing football can change quickly. When Liverpool beat Birmingham last weekend I wondered if they might put together six or seven wins and they may still do that. The criticism G\u00e9rard's get ting just comes with the territory of a big club. You have only to look at the fact that there were mutterings last season about Sir Alex Ferguson, which I found outrageous, and a little ripple that maybe Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had done his time at Arsenal. They've made that look ridiculous. G\u00e9rard needs to do the same or his time really could be up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
