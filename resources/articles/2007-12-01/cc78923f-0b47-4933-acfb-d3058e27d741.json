This week the fourth-largest search engine, Ask.com - formerly Ask Jeeves - announced the launch of AskEraser, which it happily says will throw away what you've searched for. It's thus positioning itself as the polar opposite to Google's \"history\" service, available if you take up a free login with the search site, which will show you what searches you've conducted in the past. Except it won't. Ask actually relies on Google to generate lots of the ads that come up alongside its search results, and any searches done on Ask get passed on to Google, which rolls them up into its ever-increasing database. Doug Leeds of Ask admitted to the New York Times that AskEraser can't promise you anonymity, but would \"greatly increase\" privacy protection. However, if that's the sort of privacy protection you're looking for, then you could almost just use Google, or Yahoo, or Microsoft's search engines - which between them have 91.1% of the US market (with Google having 58.5%). If you don't create a profile with them, they'll have just as good - or vague - an idea as AskEraser of where you've been. Is Ask just jumping onto a bandwagon started by Facebook users' protests about the Beacon facility that followed them around the web and alerted people to all the gifts they'd bought? Perhaps. Barry Diller's IAC spent $1.85bn to buy Ask in 2005, when the company had about 4% of search share. Now, it has a 4.7% share in the US - hardly stunning growth. Clearly, Ask needs some secret sauce, of any kind. A recent survey found that about 8% of Americans care enough about their online privacy to take steps to protect it. So there's room for Ask to grow. But AskEraser is an idea rivals could implement. \"I don't think it will be a market differentiator,\" the independent researcher Larry Ponemon told the New York Times. Ask's search for the secret sauce must go on, it seems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
