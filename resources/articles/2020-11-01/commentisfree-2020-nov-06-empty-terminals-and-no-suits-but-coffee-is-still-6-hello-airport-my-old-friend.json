He is excited to be going to the airport too. He doesn\u2019t go there much these days. \u201cThe only flights seem to be Adelaide or Ballina. Everyone is going to Byron Bay.\u201d There is something weirdly incongruous about these places being the two options \u2013 like being handed a menu and told that nothing else is available except the cheesecake and the poke bowl. I choose the poke bowl. Igor used to be a tourism operator specialising in the Russian and Ukraine market. Now, with our borders shut, his work has dried up and he drives Uber full-time. But he tells me he\u2019s very glad to be in Australia, and he enthuses about the free Covid testing clinics. We turn into General Holmes Drive, usually banked up with cars this time of the day, with people getting an early flight to the 9am meeting interstate. Now they Zoom in their tracksuits, and it\u2019s unlikely any company will be flying staff to a one-hour meeting in Melbourne, even if we do find a vaccine. I never thought there would come a time where I would feel sorry for the much-maligned Sydney Airport Corporation \u2013 but here we are. We drive up the ramp and park right outside the terminal. The last time I caught a flight was coming back from Cambodia via Bangkok in early March. Landing in Sydney airport, and then flying on to Melbourne, there were none of the screening and temperature checks that there were in Siem Reap (the airport deserted, the shops shuttered, a lone worker on the check-in desk) or Bangkok. Back in Australia in early March, we breathed down each other\u2019s necks, three deep at the luggage carousel. Eleven days later, the borders closed. Igor drops me at the Jetstar terminal. Hello old friend. It\u2019s 6:30am on a Tuesday. The vast terminal space is almost empty. Right now, the vibe at Sydney airport is best described as regional. The flight departure board is denuded \u2013 Newcastle, Dubbo, Port Macquarie, Adelaide, Ballina \u2013 then a lot of blank space. They\u2019re doing a last call to Adelaide. There are four passengers lining up to check in to Jetstar. It takes five minutes. The security check is quick too. The only remnant of old times is the explosives check. I\u2019m hit by a wave of nostalgia as I\u2019m pulled out of the queue and swabbed for explosives and do that usual thing with my eyes where I look at the ceiling as they\u2019re swabbing me, because eye contact with the explosives tester feels too weird and intense. Down the escalator is the darkened food court. Not even Macca\u2019s is open. There are three outlets open selling $6 coffees and the usual range of airport carbs. It\u2019s weird lining up for coffee. We social distance into a diamond configuration around the till but no one knows who was first. We politely indicate to each other that \u2013 no, you should go first. In addition to the social hesitancy, there\u2019s a sort of stunned look on many people\u2019s faces that says Can you believe we\u2019re even here? At an airport? Getting on a plane? The other strange thing \u2013 the absence of suits. Instead it\u2019s just one degree away from the work-from-home look: leggings, T-shirts, shorts, Birkenstocks. I try to work out who is going to Byron Bay and who is going to Adelaide by the cut of their T-shirt. Hardly anyone in the food court, maybe one in 15, is wearing a mask, but that will change on the plane, where every adult on my flight is wearing one (Jetstar provides masks and hand sanitiser to each passenger). At intervals a recorded message comes on the loudspeaker and a man\u2019s voice floods the empty halls. It mentions \u201cbeing safe\u201d or \u201csafety\u201d three times \u2013 but instead of being comforting it has the opposite effect. Like a form of Unspeak, the emphasis on safety makes me feel its opposite. I walk to gate 56. All the shops are shut. There are only two flights leaving from this terminal \u2013 Ballina and Adelaide. There\u2019s a big sign at the end of the terminal for Tigerair \u2013 which of course now no longer exists, the announcement of its closure coming on 10 September and seemingly lost in the maelstrom of end-of-time news. The atmosphere \u2013 soupy and slow, the increasingly soporific announcements about our safety \u2013 is suddenly broken by a woman sprinting through the terminal. I remember this is what it used to be like \u2013 the anxious energy of an airport, dense with tension and cortisol, people who hadn\u2019t sprinted since grade 4 sports suddenly doing a 1km dash with a bag and a baby, a boarding pass between their teeth. The running woman is trying to get to the Adelaide flight but they\u2019ve closed the gate. She starts shouting \u201cNo!\u201d and banging on the windows of the gate lounge, trying to get one of the ground staff on the bridge to hear her and let her on. It\u2019s not going to happen. Her anguish becomes operatic. People are trying to calm her down but she\u2019s in full flight. \u201cI just want to go home! I need to go home! Let me go home!\u201d She won\u2019t calm down and she won\u2019t leave the gate lounge. The plane is a metre away and the ticket is in her hands. She\u2019s sobbing now, \u201cI need to go home. I just need to go home.\u201d Something about her pierces this new turgid, bovine atmosphere. There seems to be some deeper truth in her cries, like she\u2019s articulating the true, universal meaning of 2020. I just need to go home. Staff in masks surround the woman in a socially distanced manner but she cannot be comforted. Her flight pushes back and takes off. Ours to Byron is called, and when we board, I turn back and see (or rather hear, as she is still protesting) that she is the only passenger in the terminal. Once on board, every seat is taken. The hour to Ballina passes without incident \u2013 the only discordant note being that every passenger around me is wearing a mask, and the announcements wishing us safety are played at intervals that induce dread, not comfort."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
