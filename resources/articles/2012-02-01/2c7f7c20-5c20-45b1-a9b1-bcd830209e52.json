However, this group of players were sluggish and lacked understanding in the first half and fared little better in the second despite being given the opportunity to accept territorial advantage by Birmingham City. In the early stages Branislav Ivanovic was too powerful for Nathan Redmond as he raced forward. The young winger showed a good attitude and determination to survive the whole 90 minutes but never as an attacking threat. Daniel Sturridge looked as though he might test David Murphy but, with Birmingham never caught short at the back, he was not allowed a clear run at the left-back. Birmingham's back four sat deep, stuck close together as a unit and left little space between themselves and their five-man midfield. Jordan Mutch and, to a lesser extent, Keith Fahey, were calm, composed and never played difficult forward passes for Adam Rooney to deal with. After one warning Chelsea succumbed to a lack of concentration at Birmingham's second corner, from which Murphy scored. Complacency was the main problem for Chelsea in the first half. They moved the ball slowly from side to side but rarely forward, allowing an efficient Birmingham to shield their goal comfortably (see diagram). With only one striker, the forward pass was discouraged. It would have been far more appealing for the midfield to have two targets to hit. Consequently Chelsea played across midfield and into their opponent's hands. In the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho era Damien Duff and Arjen Robben would skin full-backs, running on to Frank Lampard's perfectly placed lofted passes. Now Sturridge, when wide, likes the ball to feet, while Juan Mata is a scheming midfielder. Chelsea desperately need a second striker to support Fernando Torres or Didier Drogba. Mikel John Obi might have been sacrificed much earlier. His touch seemed unsure and Chelsea need a player like Wayne Rooney, someone who works hard but is also a natural striker. Torres is taking a huge amount of criticism but Drogba, who was also alone in the second period, coped no better. They were more dangerous when Salomon Kalou was introduced. A striker's confidence quickly disappears when he does not receive early service from midfield or defence or, alternatively, a constant supply of crosses from wide positions. Lampard is a strange omission by Villas-Boas. His game is built on getting into scoring positions and taking chances. David Luiz is an energetic luxury in defence, where reliability, simplicity and communication are paramount. In midfield Ramires and Raul Meireles were ineffective and never cohesive. Playing Mata behind two strikers in a midfield diamond could be the way forward for Chelsea. Birmingham's 4-5-1 formation showed that a disciplined group, who accept that they will concede possession, can restrict superior opponents. Chelsea played in front of Birmingham but could not find an answer, as they drifted from side to side with only one main target up front. Chelsea need goals and some inspiration. If they do not change managers or players immediately \u2013 the latter, of course, not possible \u2013 they will fail to turn this dip around. Chris Hughton's side, playing the ball out of defence with admirable composure, were never overawed, never panicked and quelled their more illustrious opponents. Their only disappointment will be another game hindering their quest for promotion. Should Birmingham win the replay at St Andrew's, though, Hughton will further press his case to be named manager of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
