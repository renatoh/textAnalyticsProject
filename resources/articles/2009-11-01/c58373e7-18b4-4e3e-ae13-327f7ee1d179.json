Before Danny Schofield and Jason Price skewed the scorecards late on, AFC, giving away 51 league positions to their opponents, went toe to toe with Millwall \u2013 which was no less than Kenny Jackett expected. \"I saw them against Crawley and I was genuinely worried about this game,\" said Jackett, who has now overseen a seven-game unbeaten record. \"Beat Leeds, beat Colchester, manager of the month \u2013 you know what is coming.\" What came was an evenly fought first half, played out in front of a crowd of just over 9,000, more than a third of whom travelled from south-west London. A fiercely fought midfield battle reduced the number of clear-cut chances, with Millwall's front pairing of Neil Harris and Steve Morison sniffing out half chances. Haye's appearance in the main stand preceded a standing ovation from the scarce home support and many may have missed Harris, another local idol, unleashing a well-struck 25-yard shot that James Pullen did well to hold. Having withstood more than half an hour of sustained pressure, AFC struck out in classic rope-a-dope fashion with the best chance of the opening half. Elliott Godfrey made progress down the right wing before cutting inside and passing to Danny Kedwell, whose scuffed effort from 12 yards bobbled inches wide. It was, however, the home side who came out swinging after the bell and took the lead when the AFC defence failed to deal with a bouncing ball and Harris finished with characteristic aplomb. Displaying some of the grit and determination that helped create the club in the vacuum left when the Dons \"franchise\" shifted to Buckinghamshire in 2003, AFC fought back. First Godfrey stabbed a shot just wide before the captain, Paul Lorraine, headed over from a free-kick. Between those two chances was a wonderful save from Pullen, displaying cat-like reflexes to adjust when Abdou's shot took a wicked deflection. The goalkeeper was helpless, though, after Jon Main cleared Chris Jackett's free-kick off the line and the Wales international Price swept the rebound home. Beaten but not bowed, AFC pulled a deserved goal backwhen Kedwell's stylish backheel freed Lewis Taylor to slot the ball home. Danny Schofield rumbled any hopes of a comeback four minutes later when he found the top corner from distance before Price, with his second of the game, finally put AFC on the canvas. AFC manager Terry Brown was phlegmatic in defeat: \"It's tinged with disappointment that we've been gallant losers again \u00f1 4-1, it's easy to say it flattered them but the truth is we gave them a couple of goals at the end.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
