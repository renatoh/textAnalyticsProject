According to Blizzard, it will also \u201credefine what a sequel means\u201d. Which is quite a claim for an online shooter. Unveiled with a crowd-pleasing cinematic trailer at annual fan convention BlizzCon last week, Overwatch 2 will introduce PvE missions in an all-new story mode, as well as a new core competitive mode, Push, a six-versus-six PvP team battle, which sees teams compete to have a robot push the map\u2019s objective to their opponent. Before now, the original 2016 first person shooter focused on PvP gameplay, with spin-off comic books and animated shorts filling in backstories for the popular crew of ragtag leads. The story mode will follow the heroes as they reunite the previously disbanded Overwatch task force. In the first glimpse, shown at the convention, the team, led by Winston, join up in Paris to defend the city against a Null Sector invasion. It\u2019s still multiplayer, but players will unite in co-op mode to play against the computer, rather than each other. Set to triumphant orchestral music, and telling the story of a super-team reunion in a ravaged city: the intro feels an awful lot like the Avengers. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because that story was developed before Avengers: Endgame came out. I think there are some parallels there,\u201d agrees Jeff Chamberlain, cinematic director at Blizzard, when we speak to him at BlizzCon, following the game\u2019s reveal. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to have a sense of that,\u201d says Lydia Bottegoni, senior vice president of story at Blizzard, on the undeniable influence of Marvel, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reverence in the story room towards Marvel content.\u201d The story team have been working on the narrative for Overwatch 2 for the past year, Bottegoni says. Though they are still finessing the details, we can expect it to be similar in tone to another set of superheroes: \u201cThunderCats has been occasionally brought up; the whimsical feel of it,\u201d says Bottegoni. We went hands-on with one such early story mission at BlizzCon. It too feels like what next year\u2019s upcoming co-op Avengers game should. The characters are individual and heroic. The world is vivid; cartoonish but not childish. The team is balanced and fun to play co-op with. Set in Rio de Janeiro, the demo sees evil robots descending from the sky and filling the streets, which we must take down. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, except for all the killer robots!\u201d quips Tracer, as she joins the cavalry. Our four-player group fights through the robot invaders to infiltrate the command ship they are coming from. Cut scenes bookend each section of gameplay, in which we make our way through Rio to blow up the pesky command ship and coordinate as a team to stop the metal meddlers. In practice, the story means there\u2019s a limit on the heroes you can use on a given mission. We have the choice of playing as Reinhardt, Lucio, Tracer, or Mei. Each member of our group can only play as one of these, so inevitably a player gets left with last dibs. But we can confirm that playing as Reinhardt and smashing through robots throughout the mission is very satisfying. It\u2019s restrictive when you\u2019re used to maining your favourite hero, though balancing a choice of heroes with a consistent story is something the developers are working on. \u201cWe have a story that we want to tell, and there are certain heroes that make sense to tell that story,\u201d explains production director Julia Humphreys, \u201cSo one of the challenges that we\u2019re facing right now is how much can we open that up to give players a choice, while still being able to tell an effective story?\u201d Crucially, working together in the PvE environment feels seamless. In fact, the co-op story mission gameplay comes so naturally to Overwatch 2 that it feels as if it has always existed in the series. This could play to its detriment: it\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s not particularly different to the original. Considering this is a sequel and not an update, it doesn\u2019t feel like a completely new game yet. Add to that the fact that the new maps for Overwatch 2 will also be added to the first game in a generous update, and that players\u2019 progress in Overwatch will migrate to Overwatch 2, and the need for an entirely new game is somewhat unclear. But the effect will inevitably be more tangible as more narrative missions are revealed \u2013 something which is still a work in progress, we are told, \u201cWe are currently in this session where we\u2019re trying to just get the very end of the story locked in,\u201d explains Chamberlain. A new gameplay experience made of replayable \u201chero missions\u201d will also allow players to level up characters and customise their skills to unlock more powerful moves. Plus, every hero has a new look for the sequel \u2013 a slick, tweaked makeover, conveniently ready for next-gen consoles. \u201cWe wanted to be able to get those really close-in emotional reactions from characters that we haven\u2019t really had before,\u201d explains technical director John Lafleur. It\u2019s another way Overwatch 2 draws inspiration from Marvel: \u201cIt\u2019s really important to us that they\u2019re recognisable immediately,\u201d says Humphreys. \u201cWe look at other superhero characters \u2013 Iron Man\u2019s had a lot of different looks over the years, whether that\u2019s in the comics, or across the different Marvel movies, but every time you look at him, you know that\u2019s Iron Man. There\u2019s never any confusion. But as a fan, there\u2019s a lot of excitement to seeing how that character has evolved over the years. And I think that\u2019s something we\u2019re really excited to do with our heroes as well.\u201d The makeovers serve a purpose in storytelling, too. \u201cThis is taking place at a later point in the story \u2013 Reinhardt has upgraded his armour; Genji has decided to put on some clothes,\u201d adds Humphreys. With the new Overwatch 2 plot, and in a nod to its Marvel inspiration, Chamberlain hints that we could even see the universe expand to include a full, animated Overwatch TV series in the future. \u201cWe talk about it,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now, our focus is entirely on supporting the games, but it doesn\u2019t mean in the future, if something came up, we wouldn\u2019t be excited to jump on that opportunity. Stay tuned.\u201d \u2022 Overwatch 2 will be released on PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One, release date TBC. \u2022 Rebecca April May attended a press event in California, with travel and accommodation paid for by Activision Blizzard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
