He said the government tried to make broadcast interviews with ministers as dull as possible. Boulton said this was part of a drive by ministers to \"emasculate\" coverage of politics on TV and radio. In recent months the Labour government has attempted to distance itself from accusations that its first term in office was dominated by spin and presentation over policy, introducing what it claims is a more open relationship with the media. As part of this change of tack the prime minister, Tony Blair, has started holding monthly US presidential-style press briefings to which TV cameras are invited. The system of lobby briefings to political journalists is also being overhauled. But Boulton claimed the government was just replacing one type of spin with another. \"We've now got a second generation of spin, fundamentally designed to give boring interviews,\" he said. \"All ministers seem to want to do is go into the studio and give the government line for 10 minutes. It's part of a drive by the government to emasculate news and current affairs coverage by making it boring,\" Boulton added. \"They also play divide and rule, trying to do things such as setting the electronic media against the print media.\" Boulton said he thought the key to defeating this latest government spin strategy lay with the BBC, as the biggest electronic media news organisation, and its relationship with Labour. He also questioned how open the new government policy for dealing with journalists actually was. \"The government is now claiming that it's embarked on a campaign of openness. What that comes down to is that Alastair Campbell gives out what information he chooses, when he chooses,\" Boulton said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
