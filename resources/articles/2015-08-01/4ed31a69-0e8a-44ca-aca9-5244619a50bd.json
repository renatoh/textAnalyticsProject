The technology company, which has repeatedly refused to release its US government-mandated diversity report, on Thursday finally released its Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) report showing that 60 out of its 83 most senior US employees were white men (72%). There were also 12 white women. Among the 83 senior executives there was just one Hispanic person, two black people, eight Asians people and no people of any other races. The report is dated July 2014. Across all levels of the company, 61% of employees were white and 71% were male, according to the report. Just 8% were black, 0.5% native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.4% American Indian or Alaskan native, 11.5% hispanic and 16.3% Asian. The company had, until now, refused to publish any of its EEO-1 reports despite the Rev Jesse Jackson, president of the Rainbow/Push Coalition, making a personal appeal to Apple CEO Tim Cook to do so at the company\u2019s shareholder meeting. Apple said it has significantly increased its diversity since the July 2014 EEO-1 filing, but did not release its official 2015 EEO-1 filing. \u201cIn the past year we hired over 11,000 women globally, which is 65% more than in the previous year,\u201d Cook said on Thursday. \u201cIn the United States, we hired more than 2,200 black employees \u2013 a 50% increase over last year \u2013 and 2,700 Hispanic employees, a 66% increase. \u201cSome people will read this page and see our progress. Others will recognize how much farther we have to go. We see both.\u201d Cook came under increased pressure to release the EEO-1 filing following the personal intervention of the country\u2019s most powerful African American politicians earlier this month. Jackson welcomed Apple\u2019s publication of its EEO-1 as a \u201cpositive step\u201d but urged technology companies to go even further in making their diversity statistics transparent. \u201cRainbowPush has asked companies to go beyond the EEO-1 report and provide additional, comprehensive, transparent data points, showing year over year numbers and percentages relating to hiring of women and people of color in the tech and non tech sectors; in leadership positions; retail and their supplier diversity spend,\u201d he said. \u201cThis data provides a much clearer picture of what companies are actually doing.\u201d While Apple\u2019s employee base is far from as diverse as its customers, it is much more representative that some other Silicon Valley companies. African Americans represent less than 1.5% of Facebook\u2019s 5,479 US employees. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company hired 36 black employees last year out of a total headcount increase of 1,216. In 2013, Facebook hired just seven additional black people, including just one black woman. Twitter employs just 49 black people out of a total US workforce of 2,910. The tiny number of African American staff \u2013 35 men and 14 women \u2013 represents just 1.7% of Twitter\u2019s US staff. African Americans account for 13.6% of the US population, according to the 2010 US census."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
