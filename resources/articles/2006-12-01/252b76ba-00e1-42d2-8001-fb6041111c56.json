Mel B", "bodyText": "These past few years, I knew who I was. I was one of the Brits In LA For No Good Reason. You know: Robbie, Kelly, the second stupidest one out of Atomic Kitten. Literally my only commitment was taking little Phoenix Chi to her ashtanga playgroup. All that changed when I met Eddie Murphy. I was in LA to be the girlfriend of the star of Dr Dolittle, and countless other movies that made you think: where did it all go right for this guy? For weeks, it was great. We'd talk about the old days: him on Saturday Night Live, me on Live And Kicking. He told me about the time he was arrested with a transvestite prostitute in his car on Hollywood Boulevard. Like his publicist said at the time: \"Eddie is a humanitarian. He was merely talking to the woman in an attempt to persuade her not to continue with a life of vice.\" It was like I was going out with Gladstone. Now I'm pregnant, and he's telling the newspapers: \"I don't know whose child that is until it has a blood test.\" Two questions: who the ruddy hell else's does he think it is? I don't have speaking rights in this town, much less dating rights. And isn't he supposed to be Daddy bleeding Day Care?
