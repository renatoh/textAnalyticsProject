Guardian followers could, however, be forgiven for reading this piece and consigning leprosy and the extreme social stigma surrounding this disease to the history books. This is of course not the case, and despite the \"significant medical advances\" mentioned in the piece we find, sadly, that the \"sea-change in social attitudes towards leprosy\" is, in many places, yet to happen. Leprosy stigma in its various forms is alive and well. With the equivalent of one person diagnosed with leprosy every two minutes (around 250,000 new cases last year) leprosy is still affecting hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Years after a cure for leprosy, social stigma is a major obstacle to the early diagnosis needed to avoid the disabilities that for too long have been associated with the disease. Many people diagnosed with leprosy are still ostracised by their communities and families, with even children forced to leave home. People who have had leprosy also find themselves discriminated against in law. In India, home to 54% of all new cases of the disease, leprosy is still grounds for a divorce, and in 2009 the supreme court upheld a law prohibiting former leprosy patients from holding public office. Fear of repercussions stops many people coming forward for diagnosis and treatment. The disabilities that develop as a result further fuel the stigma. There is still so much work to be done on tackling leprosy stigma in all its guises, with activities to reduce stigma forming part of any modern leprosy control programme.
