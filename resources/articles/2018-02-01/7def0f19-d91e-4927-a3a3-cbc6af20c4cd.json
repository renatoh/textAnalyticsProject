Modern Test rugby is almost entirely about outcome, particularly when England and Wales share the same rugby field. Post-match regrets \u2013 and goodness, Wales will have a few \u2013 must be buried six feet deep or privately tucked away for extra motivation further down the track. It might be to England\u2019s advantage, even so, to reflect momentarily on how they might be feeling had, respectively, the Kiwi television match official Glenn Newman and the home side\u2019s replacement flanker Sam Underhill not bailed them out at the weekend. Even one converted Welsh try would have altered the complexion of the match and, potentially, the entire championship. While England sit joint-top of the table before the trip to Scotland on 24 February, this absorbing contest at Twickenham on Saturday was as taut as they come. Not since the championship was expanded to six teams, for a start, have England registered fewer points at home and still won the game. Rarely, too, have they benefited from a more high-profile TMO howler; Gareth Anscombe and his understandably unhappy head coach, Warren Gatland \u2013 \u201cIt was a terrible decision\u201d \u2013 may also be New Zealanders but Mr Newman did his compatriots no favours by crucially ruling Anscombe had not grounded the ball in the 23rd minute. Nine times out of 10 Scott Williams would also have fancied diving beyond Underhill to score in the final quarter. On such tiny margins do successful title challenges rest. For all of Wales\u2019s never-say-die commitment on a cold damp day, though, it has long since ceased to be coincidental that Eddie Jones\u2019s side keep edging these tight games. Very often at the highest level it is the unsexy bits of play \u2013 the aerial contest, kick chase, restarts, defensive line speed \u2013 that settle big contests and Jones\u2019s England are increasingly sound in all those areas. Like all top sides they also hate losing so intensely that, after a while, it becomes a self\u2011fulfilling prophecy. No two players exemplify it more than Owen Farrell and Mike Brown. Brown was named man of the match before being angrily defended on live radio by Jones \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s been the most criticised player in English rugby,\u201d the head coach said \u2013 against those who would allocate the full-back\u2019s jersey elsewhere. Farrell\u2019s input was as vital as Jonny May\u2019s two early tries, underlining why he ranks increasingly high among the most influential players of his generation. \u201cThat\u2019s why he is one of the world\u2019s best players,\u201d said his recalled club-mate Richard Wigglesworth. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the effect he has on the game as an individual but the effect he has on the people around him.\u201d A clearly satisfied Farrell still had a tell-tale gleam in his eye 90 minutes after the final whistle; natural-born warriors love nothing more than a \u201cproper\u201d Test of manhood and spirit. \u201cThere\u2019s a resilience to us, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it an invincibility but, when you\u2019ve been in an arm wrestle for that long and come out on the right side, it shows you\u2019re heading in the right direction. I think that\u2019s what big teams do. They come out on top in the end. There\u2019s no massive secret to what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s about us working hard and preparing properly for the next Test.\u201d In almost the same breath, though, the 26-year-old accepted that England might have gone down had Underhill not scooped the slithering Williams out of play just inches short of the line: \u201cThat tackle by Sam Underhill was unbelievable, one of the best you\u2019ll see. It shows our attitude when it comes to it. Normally just try to get the player into touch. Sam\u2019s got in close, got his shoulder on him, flipped him over and not even given him the chance to place the ball. He\u2019s a tackling machine. You don\u2019t expect anything less.\u201d The modest Underhill made it all sound less calculating \u2013 \u201cI just remember sheer panic ... pegging it to the corner because I\u2019d slipped over and they had an overlap and being so glad I made it in time\u201d \u2013 but the former Osprey\u2019s strength and awareness of angles underlined his rare defensive aptitude. With Joe Launchbury and Dan Cole as unselfishly influential as ever, Jones\u2019s preference for electing durable characters with an unquenchable appetite for hard graft continues to yield consistent results. England have now won 15 Six Nations home games on the trot, equalling the great Wales and France sides of the 1970s and 80s and eclipsing even Sir Clive Woodward\u2019s World Cup winners. The next step is to go one further and become the first country to win three outright championship titles in successive years, with Ireland\u2019s visit to London on St Patrick\u2019s Day now visible on the horizon. Injuries to Anthony Watson and Sam Simmonds will require monitoring but, otherwise, England could scarcely be better placed. If \u2013 that awkward little word again \u2013 Scotland can be beaten at Murrayfield and the head coach suspends hostilities with media outlets who do not agree with his every syllable, March could yield the most upbeat global coverage of English rugby since 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
