The beach boys are busy manicuring the ruffled sand outside their concessions with antique contraptions like cages on poles, which leave disciplined stripes like a lawnmower; then comes the hammering-in of the parasols and the laying-out of the mattresses. Take your pick from yellow at the far end of the long curving beach, then turquoise, blue, green and maroon. The big decision comes at lunchtime; shall it be moules at the maroon, or fruits de mer at the blue? St Tropez may be only 45km to the east, but it could be on another planet. The image of Riviera gloss and glitter has no relevance in this stretch of Var, whose intimate sandy beaches, divided by rocky outcrops and shaded by pines, are an abiding unsophisticated delight. An elderly Frenchman potters down into the water, trailing a thermometer on a string behind him. \"Vingt degr\u00e9s. Trop froid Madame,\" he pronounces. Not for me it's not. Not after the chilly English waters. I strike out into the bay directly into the path of the rising sun, splintering its glitter with a lazy breaststroke. To the left, the mountains are still in shadow: to the right the Porquerolles islands swim in haze - a sign of a fine day to come. Back at the Auberge Falaise, overlooking the beach, breakfast is ready, served on the terrace under the vine canopy. Three generations of the Brun family are involved in the auberge: mother and father look after the admin, son Georges is chef, and grand-daughters Celine and Caroline wait at table, but the star is daughter-in-law Anne-Marie, who is literally femme de m\u00e9nage , involved in every aspect, from cleaning the 14 rooms to chatting up the guests. Particularly chatting up the guests. If you need to know what time the boats run to the islands, which are the best beaches, and what the forecast is, ask the omniscient Anne-Marie. She reminded us that Thursday is market day in Le Lavandou, just 2km away by cliff path, or five minutes' drive. The olive trees covering the surrounding hills are the source of all manner of market goodies: polished bowls, chopping boards, olive oils in intimidating variety, and whole stalls of the olives themselves - purple, black, mauve, light green and olive. There are pipes made from the briars of the maquis, goat's cheeses, wine from the surrounding vineyards, almonds still in their pale furry jackets, and herbs culinary and medicinal to cure every ailment from piles to snoring. Bunches of lavender, which gives the town its name, perfumed the streets. Baby Cavaillon melons were just in season, overflowing their stalls, peaches came blanches, jaunes or \u00e0 la vigne, and someone had been up early to find an astonishing array of wild mushrooms. Post-war building has not done Le Lavandou any favours, but the core of the former fishing village remains resolutely proven\u00e7al. The brightly-painted fishermen's houses have been converted into a lively parade of restaurants. The five boules pitches are shaded by the traditional pleached limes, and the fountain suggests coolness in the baking summer heat. Boats from Le Lavandou take 50 minutes to dock at one of the offshore islands; all three are delightful but very different. For the largest, Porquerolles, take money (good restaurants, one with the area's only Michelin star), for Port Cros take walking shoes (nature reserve), for Levant take nothing, not even a bathing costume (naturist colony). Le Lavandou bills itself as La station aux 12 sables , but the main beach can be unpleasantly crowded; St Clair is far preferable, and there are other less obvious choices. To the east lies a series of charming little sandy bays, some discovered only by scrambling down rough unmarked tracks through the pines. A favourite is La Fossette. It does have a beach caf\u00e9 and parasols for hire in high season, but is otherwise unspoilt - a perfect horseshoe of fine sand, sheltered by rocky arms. Then, after two more small \"private\" beaches, comes the most sheltered of all and one of the most delightful - La Layet. Unfortunately, for some, there is a catch - like taking off all your clothes. Beyond Cavalaire, the corkscrewing corniche road offers staggering views down to tempting coves accessible only by boat until it descends into the little resort of Le Rayol with its lovely unsignposted beach. On the other side of Le Lavandou, the ugly concrete marina, camping sites and new developments take up an eye-offending chunk of the nearer coastline of the Bormes peninsula. But the western side is still much as nature intended - covered in olive and cork trees punctuated by the occasional umbrella pine. But there's more to the Var than seaside. Close to the coast, the mountains add another dimension. There are lovely walks behind St Clair, La Route des Marguerites, into carpets of wild flowers. In spring, wild gladioli, snapdragons and asphodels poke through the rock roses, and the air is pungent with lavender, pine, and thyme. Follow the mountain road towards St Tropez and, quite unexpectedly, you will find the Relais du Vieux Sauvaire, perched on an escarpment, with staggering views down to the sea. Bormes-les-Mimosas is a pretty name for an extremely pretty village, perched defensively above Le Lavandou. Steep stone steps are polished shiny with age, flowery courtyards encourage exploration, and some of restaurants are better than any in Le Lavandou, although priced for tourists. Continue further on the same mountain road for a breathtaking 25km up the Col de Babaou to find a less-contrived prettiness at Collobri\u00e8res. As typically proven\u00e7al a village as you could wish to find, its main products are wine and chestnuts.But its main attraction, tucked away behind an unpromising facade, is La Petite Fontaine, a tiny restaurant that has firmly resisted any attempts to change its d\u00e9cor or menu. The former is dark, fusty, crowded, the latter is peasant food in abundant quantity. You emerge several hours later, blinking in the sunshine, happily replete, having paid a minimal bill.
