As the campaign enters its final two days, the Labour leader will tell supporters that leaving the EU would put Britain\u2019s economic recovery at risk and threaten a \u201cbonfire of employment rights\u201d. The rallying cry to party members comes after criticisms from some on the remain side that Corbyn has been lukewarm in his commitment to the campaign. The leave camp has privately revealed that it has gained the backing of many traditional Labour supporters, particularly outside major cities. Corbyn will appear on Tuesday in Manchester alongside the former home secretary Alan Johnson, the chairman of remain group Labour In. In some his most pro-EU comments yet, Corbyn will say: \u201cOn 23 June we are faced with a choice: do we remain to protect jobs and prosperity in Britain that depend on trade with Europe? Or do we step into an unknown future with leave, where a Tory-led Brexit risks economic recovery and threatens a bonfire of employment rights? \u201cA vote for remain is a vote to put our economy first. On Thursday, join me in voting remain to protect jobs and rights at work.\u201d His intervention is part of a day of action for senior Labour figures, with Ed Miliband speaking in Luton, Harriet Harman in Birmingham, Gordon Brown in Glasgow and the deputy party leader, Tom Watson, travelling to Brighton. At a question and answer session on Sky News on Monday, Corbyn again expressed his reservations about the EU, but argued that voters should choose to stay in it. He said the EU must change \u201cdramatically\u201d if Britain remains a member following the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big decision. If we stay in Europe, there are implications; if we leave Europe, there are massive implications,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is also a turning point, because if we leave, I don\u2019t think there is an easy way back. If we remain, I believe Europe has got to change quite dramatically to something much more democratic, much more accountable, and share our wealth and improve our living standards, and our working conditions, all across the whole continent. \u201cI\u2019m not a lover of the European Union. I think it\u2019s a rational decision. We should stay in order to try and improve, but does that change my views on points I\u2019ve raised on public ownership of railways and things like that? Absolutely not.\u201d When asked if he would shoulder some of the blame in the event of a vote to leave, Corbyn replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to take blame for people\u2019s decisions. There will be a decision made on Thursday. I\u2019m hoping there is going to be a remain vote; there may well be a remain vote, there may well be a leave vote.\u201d Told that he did not sound \u201ctoo keen\u201d on the EU, the Labour leader replied: \u201cWhatever the result, we have got to work with it.\u201d In a further development, Len McCluskey has told the Guardian that the enlargement of the EU in the 2000s was a \u201cgigantic experiment\u201d conducted at the expense of ordinary British workers. McCluskey, the head of the Unite union, wrote that he was not surprised that Labour voters were concerned about immigration. \u201cIn the last 10 years, there has been a gigantic experiment at the expense of ordinary workers. Countries with vast historical differences in wage rates and living standards have been brought together in a common labour market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result has been sustained pressure on living standards, a systematic attempt to hold down wages, and to cut the costs of social provision for working people.\u201d On Sunday, Corbyn told Andrew Marr that he did not believe that there could be an upper limit on immigration while there was free movement within the EU, causing some concern among Labour MPs. Ten countries joined the EU in 2004: Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Cyprus. Romania and Bulgaria joined in 2007. In a further sign of tensions on the remain side, Alan Johnson has conceded that the campaign is \u201cstruggling\u201d with some serious challenges. During the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast, he said the referendum \u201cis kind of turning into a referendum on Cameron\u2019s vainglorious policy of reducing immigration to the tens of thousands, which he was never going to do\u201d. The former home secretary said this was the dynamic \u201cas soon as the [second quarter] immigration statistics came out, and we\u2019re still struggling with the after-effects of that\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
