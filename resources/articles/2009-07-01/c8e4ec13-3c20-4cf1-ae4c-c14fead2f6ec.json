UK Sport, the agency that distributes lottery and government money to individual athletes and their sports, was granted a record \u00a3600m for the six years to 2012 to fuel top performances and boost British hopes for medals in front of a home crowd. The government promised \u00a3100m of that funding would come from business sponsorship, but plans to raise it with a scheme entitled Medal Hopes never materialised. The government has contributed another \u00a350m, so to cover the missing \u00a350m, UK Sport, backed by the British Olympic and Paralympic associations, has come up with a package \u2013 Team 2012 \u2013 that will offer sponsors the right to use Olympic athletes in advertising campaigns. Of the 1,150 competitors across the Olympic sports who receive public funding, UK Sport says \"close to 1,000\" have signed the Team 2012 agreements. The agency is understood to be in advanced negotiations with a lead sponsor for a deal it hopes will bring in more than \u00a310m. Those resisting signing, however, include some of the top names most attractive to sponsors, including the Beijing gold medallists Rebecca Adlington, cyclist Chris Hoy and 400m runner Christine Ohuruogu. Some athletes' agents are arguing the proposed scheme demands too much of the athletes' rights and will affect their opportunities to earn money from individual sponsorships. The scheme will give each sponsor \u2013 UK Sport is aiming for nine \u2013 the right to have members of the GB team in one campaign every year up to 2012. They cannot name an individual athlete they would like, and have to picture them in groups of four, but they can choose from different categories. As one of the categories is multiple Olympic gold medallists, those elite performers are concerned that their pictures will be used by a range of different sponsors. The temperature is rising on the issue; UK Athletics sent the Team 2012 agreement to its athletes on 18 June, with a warning that if they do not sign, the athletes' funding \u2013 public money that helps them to live as professional sports people \u2013 will be cut. Some competitors, though, are digging in. Rob Woodhouse, an agent who represents Adlington and the Beijing 10km silver medal-winning swimmer David Davies, said his clients will not be signing. \"We respect UK Sport's position,\" he said, \"but they are trying to fill this hole in funding, which the government promised, by taking rights to the athletes which they do not own, and packaging them up to sell to sponsors. \"Rebecca Adlington is totally supportive of British swimming, the GB team and the responsibilities which come with lottery funding, but this will massively reduce her ability to secure her own sponsorships.\" The context for this argument is delicate, because the athletes have been paid public money for some years, which has provided the support that has helped them achieve success and, for the few, claim sponsorship riches. The \u00a3600m commitment from 2006 means the Olympic sports are bountifully funded, with most money going to the high-profile sports or those deemed to have the best British medal chances. Athletics is to receive \u00a325.1m between this year and April 2013; swimming will be given \u00a325.6m to pay for coaches, travel and technical support; rowing \u00a327.4m; and sailing \u00a323.4m. Individual athletes are also paid money directly to live on and to enable them to devote themselves to their sports full-time, a luxury few had before lottery funding. The amounts paid, tax-free, range from \u00a312,000 for more junior competitors to \u00a326,000 for the top \"podium\" athletes. This funding stops when an athlete earns just over \u00a360,000 a year from their own commercial work. The sports sell sponsorship deals that require athletes to wear designated kit and be associated with particular brands, and there are official sponsors for the 2012 Olympics themselves, for which the competitors are not paid. It has always been part of the system that beyond those official commitments and duties, including making three personal appearances a year as part of the lottery funding, athletes have been free to sell their own \"image rights\". Their agents point out that only the very top names have a chance of securing lucrative sponsorship deals worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. The majority even of Olympic athletes work hard to bring in much smaller amounts, which, with the lottery funding, may enable them to make a living. Jonathan Marks, who runs the MTC agency that represents the cyclist Bradley Wiggins, triple jumper Phillips Idowu, and many others, is advising his clients not to sign. He cites one client who has been told a sponsorship deal worth \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000 a year will end because the sponsors will soon be able to use Olympic athletes' images in their campaigns via the Team 2012 scheme. \"The athletes are all massively grateful for the lottery funding and public support,\" Marks acknowledges. \"Most of them are not highly paid, they have done a great deal for sport, but this is packaging them up again, to sign a huge amount of value away. We've asked UK Sport to think of another way of raising the money required and we really want to work with them.\" That, though, does not appear to be an option. The Team 2012 plan was launched in February, after Medal Hopes failed to get off the ground and was scrapped. UK Sport sources admit they had not fully considered all the potential impacts on athletes before announcing the new plans, but insist they have now made significant concessions, including athletes not having to appear in Team 2012 sponsorships that compete with their own. \"This scheme is fundamental to the ability of sports to receive funding,\" maintains Tim Hollingsworth, UK Sport's director of policy and communications. \"Team 2012 embodies the Olympic team as a whole, not individual athletes, and we have gone a long way to meeting individual concerns to minimise the impact it will have. The athletes have all enjoyed the funding and this is a way in which they can support it continuing.\" From the government there is a hint of impatience with athletes who have attained their positions \u2013 and their own earning potential \u2013 partly thanks to the public money that helped fund their development. \"We are completely behind the Team 2012 project,\" a spokesman said. \"We want a private sector scheme to add to the exchequer and lottery money that our elite athletes receive, benefitting those competing not only in London 2012 but in future Olympic and Paralympic games. We are investing record amounts of public funding into elite sport in the four years to 2012 so want our world-class athletes to sign up to Team 2012 to give something back. We would be disappointed if our best athletes didn't want to help out.\" With UK Sport adamant they will make no further changes nor consider an alternative to the plan, and many swimmers, cyclists and athletes insisting they are being asked to sign too much away, no resolution is in sight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
