O\u2019Neill said he was \u201cmorose\u201d after landing Italy, Sweden and Belgium in Saturday night\u2019s draw but his side would take inspiration from the approach showed by some sides at the Brazil World Cup in targeting victory in their opening group match, at the Stade de France in Paris on 13 June. \u201cI think the first game becomes very important \u2013 as it would be anyway. There seemed be a feeling out in Rio at the time that teams wanted to try and win the first game rather than being more cagey,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, who was in Brazil as a TV pundit. \u201cFor us the first game is very, very important. The group is tough but I think that when I get over this initial moroseness, I think that I will be absolutely fine.\u201d He said that given the strength of their opponents his side, who came through an equally tough qualifying group, could not afford to try and plot a way through and would simply have to go all-out in every game. \u201cThe games we have are tough so starting to plan getting points here and there is, I think, a total waste of time,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just go for it, genuinely take the games as they appear \u2013 Sweden first \u2013 and throw everything into it.\u201d O\u2019Neill said he would not necessarily make any special provision for Sweden\u2019s talisman, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and preparations would begin in earnest in the new year. \u201cWe\u2019ll get hundreds of DVDs, we\u2019ll be well equipped and there\u2019ll be no reason whatsoever for us to not be as prepared as any side can possibly be for the three games,\u201d he said. The Republic will take on Slovakia, who are in the same group as England and Wales, in a friendly at the Aviva Stadium in March. Another friendly game in Dublin, against opponents yet to be finalised, will take place at the end of May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
