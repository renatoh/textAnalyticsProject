But it will be special because a draw will get us through to the next round and not because of my background and the fact that it is against Croatia.\" Group G South Korean fans do the dirty work in Leipzig South Korea Street cleaners in Leipzig got a pleasant surprise on Monday morning when they discovered South Korean fans had done the work for them, clearing plastic cups and waste paper into garbage bags before the cleaners arrived at 5am. \"It was great.
