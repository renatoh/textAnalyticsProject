The new findings are from the Canal &amp; River Trust \u2013 the charity that looks after 2,000 miles of canals and river navigations \u2013 and which says that with the support of local communities both figures could be cut drastically. With help from Coventry University, the charity has published a detailed analysis of the plastics and other litter found in the canals, based on data from 25 rural and urban locations. While plastics now account for 59% of waste found along and in the canals, it is estimated that 570,000 items of plastic end up in the world\u2019s oceans each year via its waterways. The charity spends more than \u00a31m every year to help keep its waterways free of plastics and other litter \u2013 money that could be spent in other ways \u2013 but says that if every visitor picked up and recycled just one piece of plastic on each visit, the network could be plastic-free in a year. The Trust is urging communities to take action on their doorstep to clean up their local neighbourhood and help tackle the global plastics crisis. Visitors and passersby could make their own small contribution to help keep canals clear of plastics, it says, whether by picking up and recycling a piece each time they visit, joining the Trust\u2019s growing band of volunteers, or even \u201cadopting\u201d a short stretch of their local canal with friends, neighbours or colleagues. \u201cWe know that life is better by water and more people than ever appreciate the benefits of spending time alongside our waterways, right at the heart of thousands of communities across the country\u201d said Richard Parry, chief executive of Canal &amp; River Trust. \u201cPlastic- and litter-free canals are beautiful, inspiring places for people to enjoy, whether for everyday use or a one-off visit, whilst also being hugely important habitats for some of the nation\u2019s much loved and endangered species.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
