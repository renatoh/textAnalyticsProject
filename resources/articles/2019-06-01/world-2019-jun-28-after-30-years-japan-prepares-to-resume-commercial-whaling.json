They will not head to the southern ocean, the controversial hunting ground for Japan\u2019s \u201cscientific\u201d whaling programme since the late 1980s, but to coastal waters, six months after the country announced it would leave the International Whaling Commission [IWC] on 30 June. Its decision to leave came after the IWC, the body responsible for protecting global whale populations, voted down its proposal to resume the commercial hunting of species whose stocks Japanese officials say have recovered. The vessels\u2019 imminent departure from Kushiro, on the northern island of Hokkaido, to kill minke, sei and Bryde\u2019s whales, drew condemnation as Japan and its pro-whaling prime minister, Shinzo Abe, prepared to host G20 leaders in Osaka. In a letter published on Friday, conservation groups and celebrities including Stephen Fry and Ricky Gervais urged G20 leaders to stage an \u201cintervention\u201d at the summit and publicly condemn commercial whaling. \u201cIt has taken the combined efforts of every nation on earth to bring whale conservation to the fore,\u201d the naturalist and TV presenter Steve Backshall said. \u201cAt the G20 summit, our leaders need to talk to our friends in Japan, and let them know that \u2013 on this issue \u2013 they are deeply at odds with the rest of the world.\u201d Japan\u2019s government will not reveal the hunt\u2019s quota until after the G20, reportedly to avoid a backlash during its two days in the diplomatic spotlight. Kitty Block, president of Humane Society International, said: \u201cJapan leaving the IWC and defying international law to pursue its commercial whaling ambitions is renegade, retrograde and myopic, it is undermining its international reputation for an industry whose days are so clearly numbered, to produce a product for which demand has plummeted. \u201cThe IWC is maintaining its ban on commercial whaling for very good reasons and world leaders meeting in Japan this week should not turn a blind eye to the cruel assault planned on whales of the north Pacific.\u201d But in Ayukawa, a remote village on the Pacific coast whose connection with whale hunting goes back to the early 1900s, local officials and fishermen believe the resumption of commercial whaling will help revive the local economy. \u201cPeople here have hunted whales for a long time, so we thought it was only natural for Japan to leave the IWC and start hunting commercially again,\u201d said Masaaki Sato, a fisherman who started working on research whaling expeditions 20 years ago in his late teens. One vessel and several fishermen from Ayukawa will join the fleet due to leave on Monday morning, one day after Japan quits the IWC. Shinetsu Oikawa, a local official, believes the resumption of commercial whaling will bring tourists to Ayukawa, which was badly damaged in the March 2011 tsunami that killed almost 19,000 people along Japan\u2019s northeast coast. \u201cAyukawa is very remote, road access is poor and there\u2019s no space for industry, so whaling is the best way for the town to make the most of its natural resources,\u201d Oikawa said. \u201cNow we want tourists to come and eat whale meat, spend money and help us truly recover from the disaster.\u201d In September, a large tourist centre will open in the village featuring restaurants serving whale meat. \u201cThis is a chance for the area to finally look forward,\u201d added Oikawa, who misses the local delicacy \u2013 boiled whale offal seasoned with ginger-infused soy sauce. \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years since I last ate that.\u201d Shinji Sato, who has run an izakaya restaurant in nearby Ishinomaki for 35 years, was a relatively late convert to whale meat. \u201cI first ate it when I was around 20, and to be honest, I didn\u2019t like it much,\u201d the 65-year-old said. \u201cBut as I got older and my tastes changed and I came to love the texture,\u201d added Sato, whose restaurant serves whale meat deep-fried, as sashimi and in gyoza dumplings. \u201cTo eat whale meat is part of being Japanese, and it enables people in this region connect with their past. I don\u2019t see why anyone should object to that.\u201d But in regularly eating whale meat, Sato is going against the culinary grain. Domestic consumption has plummeted from 200,000 tons in the 1960s, when it was an important source of protein, to less than 5,000 tons in recent years. \u201cIn the past 30 years, all kinds of foods have come into Japan; there are so many things to eat,\u201d Kazuo Yamamura, president of the Japan Whaling Association, told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a situation where if you produce lots of whale meat, you\u2019re going to make lots of money.\u201d Some observers have pointed out that the coastal expeditions will be much smaller than previous research hunts and would save hundreds of whales that Japan once caught in more distant waters. It could also be cheaper, as the fleet will no longer have to travel to the Antarctic. Japan used a clause in the IWC\u2019s 1986 moratorium to hunt a certain number of whales in the Antarctic in the name of scientific research, but grew frustrated over its repeated failure to reform the IWC to facilitate a return to commercial whaling. Patrick Ramage, director of marine conservation at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said the \u201castonishing\u201d decision to leave the IWC was a \u201cface-saving\u201d admission that Japan\u2019s research expeditions had achieved nothing of scientific value, but had instead caused diplomatic friction with anti-whaling nations such as Australia. \u201cBased on this astonishing development and concerns recently expressed by coastal whalers regarding the dwindling market for their product, it appears what we are seeing is the beginning of the end of Japanese whaling,\u201d Ramage said. \u201cOnly the most convinced fisheries agency bureaucrat would suggest it is still possible to resuscitate consumer demand and commence a glorious new era of coastal commercial whaling and domestic demand for whale meat.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
