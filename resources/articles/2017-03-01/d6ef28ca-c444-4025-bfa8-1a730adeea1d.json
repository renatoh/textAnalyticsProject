Call centre woman changes everything. \u201cTwo years ago ... I never told anyone.\u201d Another rape victim. But what does it mean? It gets creepy beardy \u201cman cave\u201d man off the hook as he would have been in prison. Or does that date actually incriminate him because it was just before his arrest? Either way, it doesn\u2019t really exonerate anyone else \u2013 and it might be totally unrelated. Just when you thought it couldn\u2019t get any more complex. This was a brilliantly suspenseful episode with only a few \u201cWhaaa ...?\u201d moments. (Like the football match, of which more later.) The flashback to the least fun birthday party ever was excellent. \u201cI want to help. I want to remember.\u201d A fantastic piece of editing, showcasing what a fine actor Julie Hesmondhalgh is. \u201cI brought some plates back, trying to be helpful.\u201d So Cath\u2019s 50th wasn\u2019t in fact an orgy or a swingers\u2019 party? Shame. Still, it was amazing to see Hesmondhalgh transforming her character into the person Trish was pre-attack. And as for the extremely gruelling reconstruction ... \u201cSmell of water, leaves, vodka. A light shining from over there.\u201d Miller looked like she was going to throw up too. As usual, Hardy was pushing too hard for information. \u201cWhat was that light, Miller?\u201d It\u2019s the old buffer, the owner of the house, of course. Only he doesn\u2019t live there; we don\u2019t know who lives there. (Surely a massive oversight? It directly overlooks the scene of the crime.) And this, the sinister wheelbarrow of doom? And the cricket bat that is one of a pair? More work for the overworked DNA lab who already hate Hardy. Meanwhile the most reckless convicted rapist in the country has moved back to the area. In a world of too-obvious suspects, he truly wins the award (unless he\u2019s so obvious that it actually must be him?) \u201cI\u2019ve served my sentence.\u201d Creepy, creepy Aaron with his creepy data entry and his creepy man cave. A man who \u201clikes to play\u201d. (Massive skin crawl alert. More girlie pics alert.) And he\u2019s another customer of the fishing twine emporium! Why on Earth do these people go fishing in the middle of the night? If he\u2019s on parole, would he really speak to a police officer like that? This pushed credulity too far. As did Cath\u2019s cheering football tournament, which was not entirely suspect but really quite odd \u2013 and universally supported. Did no one think to say: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit tasteless, Cath. Maybe in six months\u2019 time?\u201d What a very strange match, featuring 80% of the suspects in the murder case and with Hardy and Miller as the main spectators. Why would Beth take part in the game as a rape crisis worker? And wouldn\u2019t Cath find a better way to help her \u201cbest friend\u201d? But Cath is in her own zone \u2013 and it might be a zone of revenge. \u201cCould you describe your marriage?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d describe it as loveless.\u201d Oh dear. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Jim was at the end of the evening. I couldn\u2019t find him anywhere.\u201d Is Cath taking advantage of the opportunity to set Jim up? Why would she do that \u2013 because she knows Jim is the Saturday morning man? Finally we learned the identity of Trish\u2019s surprise weekend date. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t attack her, why would your DNA be part of her sample?\u201d Of course. \u201cOn the morning of your wife\u2019s birthday.\u201d Miller\u2019s face! This will change things, as Trish has now lost Miller\u2019s support. More shenanigans piled up. We were reminded of the inadequacy and peculiarity of Clive. Ian\u2019s girlfriend Sarah became part of the web of deceit. Mark Latimer acquired Joe Miller\u2019s address and cooked some fish he had not cooked since Beth\u2019s 28th birthday. (That seems a suspiciously long time to not cook fish.) \u201cJust think of me as a guest chef for the night.\u201d \u201cNo agenda?\u201d Mark is the most agenda-filled person in Broadchurch and that is saying something. Oh, yes, and I\u2019m forgetting the two most important things. In Trumpton the only person left to be friends with Hardy\u2019s daughter is the sister of the boy murdered in series one. And as if things weren\u2019t weird enough, Hardy went on a Tinder date. Miller vs Hardy: the score so far Excellent double-act action during the meeting with the convicted rapist. \u201cWell, he sounds like a delight. Can\u2019t wait to meet him ...\u201d \u201cFussy about age, are you?\u201d \u201cQuite the gallery you\u2019ve got.\u201d \u201cKeeps me motivated.\u201d Neither of them are getting a good night\u2019s sleep, though I doubt either of them have ever slept for longer than an hour in their lives. Miller\u2019s tickled face at the thought of Hardy actually doing something with his time off was a picture. But he was doing something interesting and amusing. Well done, Hardy. The pub scene was fabulously awkward, but not as awkward as the moment when Miller and Hardy clashed in the street. Heart-in-mouth moment. A draw. Hardy 1. Miller 1. Not the usual suspects Any sensible person must now highly suspect the old buffer who owns the property, is obsessed with the waterfall, and also potentially moved the sinister wheelbarrow of doom. I don\u2019t believe it was his wife; I think he has the other cricket bat. Then, of course, suspect number 4,861 comes in the form of the convicted rapist who has handily moved into the area. Why, though, haven\u2019t they checked out twine man\u2019s alibi yet? They knew about his twine access even before the goalposts. I must also mention The Vicar with a Sense of Humour. We have no concrete reason to suspect him but he keeps popping up looking shifty. Still not off the hook: Ed Burnett, Jim Atwood, Ian the ex-husband, Clive the taxi driver, the grumpy catering man, the guitarist in the band ... I\u2019ve given up trying to remember them all. Life lesson Do not have sex with your wife\u2019s best friend on the morning of your wife\u2019s 50th birthday party. It\u2019s pretty basic. Trademark Wessex words of wisdom \u201cYou think I raped her at my own wife\u2019s birthday party?\u201d Unfortunate choice of words for a man who had to admit in the next sentence that he may not be a criminal (or so he claims) but that he did indeed have sex with Trish on the morning of his, er, wife\u2019s birthday. \u201cWas that you doing \u2018supportive boss\u2019?\u201d Miller\u2019s most sceptical face yet. \u201cShe did all the swiping?\u201d You bet she did. Hardy doesn\u2019t swipe. \u201cWhite wine, dry. Like I like my men.\u201d Stupid Things You Say On Dates When You Are Nervous, No 784."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
