Inspired by the recent social media trend, Jane, her husband Chris, their son Nick and daughter Amy \u2013 who are all in lockdown together \u2013 set themselves an Easter challenge to recreate a classic artwork using things they already had at home. To achieve the image, they took four separate shots in their back garden \u2013 changing costumes and poses between each \u2013 and then stitched the photos together digitally. \u201cMy husband kept saying: \u2018We\u2019ve got to be quick because the light keeps changing.\u2019 He was putting us under loads of pressure. We were all wearing different bits of sheet and he was saying \u2018Come on, get changed!\u2019 and we\u2019d say \u2018Where\u2019s my arm supposed to be? Where am I looking?\u2019 \u2026 You\u2019d probably only do it in a lockdown.\u201d As people across the UK must continue to stay at home because of the coronavirus, we asked Guardian readers how they are planning to celebrate Easter in lockdown. Dozens of churchgoers told us that they had discovered new ways to worship together, and will be tuning into online services and prayer meetings. A group called Student Cross has adapted its annual pilgrimage to the Anglican and Roman Catholic shrines in Little Walsingham, Norfolk. \u201cWe normally walk in 11 different groups, carrying a cross and stopping to share refreshment and reflections with those we meet,\u201d says Laura Mitcham. But with the pilgrimage cancelled this year, participants can instead go online to log their steps from walking around their home or local area as part of their daily exercise, as well as taking part in daily Zoom liturgy services. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as the physical pilgrimage, says Mitcham, \u201cbut it\u2019s something special that will be remembered due to its unique nature and the way the community has pulled together.\u201d Many people across the country are baking hot cross buns and Simnel cakes, decorating houses with homemade ornaments, and organising indoor Easter egg hunts. \u201cMy daughter absolutely loves rabbits so Easter is her favourite time of year,\u201d says Rachel Acres from Bradford-on-Avon. On Thursday, she and Bethany, seven, dug out leftover cardboard from their garage to make into giant rabbits and decorate their front garden \u201cto wish all passers-by a happy Easter\u201d. In Cornwall, Sarah Parmenter is staging a mini-festival for her four-year-old son who has loved doing Easter egg hunts with his cousins and friends in previous years. \u201cThe bunting will be out, magical Easter egg plants will have grown in the garden and of course the bunny will have visited \u2013 apparently he has a special sleigh which allows him to comply with social distancing requirements,\u201d says Parmenter. \u201cWe already have an Easter tree decorated with a special sign, reminding the bunny to stop here.\u201d For Millie Jones and her housemates, this weekend marks not only Easter but also the end of their two-week self-quarantine after one started showing symptoms. To celebrate, they\u2019ll have \u201ca very tame blowout\u201d and recreate a typical Christmas day: Bucks Fizz and croissants in the morning, films and chocolate in the afternoon, then a huge roast dinner. \u201cWe want to make it as fun as possible,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re all living in the week between Christmas and New Year anyway, so we want to create a festive day, celebrating each other, in this time of lockdown.\u201d Rik Sterken and his family had planned to spend a few nights on the Welsh coast this weekend. Instead, they\u2019re taking a mini-camping trip into their back garden. \u201cWe reckon the tent just about fits,\u201d says Sterken. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep a sense of normality but also a sense of adventure as well.\u201d On Friday night, Sterken, his wife and two children will eat pizzas from their home-built, wood-fired pizza oven for the first time this year, and enjoy barbecued bacon butties on Saturday morning. \u201cThe kids are really excited, although we haven\u2019t told them yet they\u2019ll be sleeping on camping mats,\u201d he says. And unable to go to France on holiday, Crista Hazell and her husband Jon will be donning rabbit ears and painting on whiskers to be the Easter bunny for their older neighbours. \u201cWe know they can\u2019t see their families so thought we\u2019d help them find a smile on Sunday by placing a few Easter eggs (with clean hands) on doorsteps before the sun rises,\u201d says Crista, an author and education consultant from Bristol. \u201cIt\u2019s something a bit daft, but hopefully we can give them a little love and enjoyment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
