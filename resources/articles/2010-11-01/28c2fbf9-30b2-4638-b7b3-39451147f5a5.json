Don't read on if you haven't seen episode six \u2013 and if you've seen future episodes, please be aware that many UK viewers have not. Anna Pickard's episode five blog The president and his grimacing staff may have hatched a clever plan last week both to release Sophia and ensnare the rogue Thomas (thus recapturing them both) but they forgot to take a couple of tiny things into account: the mole in their midst . . . and the fact that Thomas can bend time and space whenever he feels like it. They'll probably regret that, after this week's episode. \"Loyalty\" Sophia is now on the loose as part of the grand plan by the president and Sterling to snare Thomas. Thomas has fixed it so that she will find, on an empty subway train, an earpiece that will guide her to him, avoiding all CCTV cameras and tails. Sterling and his intelligence brigade, however, have cunningly dosed her food with a unique radioactive isotope that allows her to be tracked from space wherever she is \u2013 underground, over ground, wombling free. It's a convoluted plan, but no more so than any other plan in this series, so we will let that slide. Agent Simon, the extraterrestrial interloper working inside the government, is alerted to the tracer placed inside Sofia, and immediately sends her to a coffee shop and hightails it there. Once inside he places the same crazy tracing agent in the milk, turning everyone who drops in for a quick double whip soy caramel chai latte a decoy for the tracing equipment. While the troops are confused, Sophia sneaks off for her rendezvous with Thomas in a deserted building. He takes her to the basement, and, then below the basement (an underbasement, if you will). What's in there? The subway? The sewers? No, in fact it's some kind of whirling space-time vortex that sucks them magically away, and brings the building down on top of them. Meanwhile, when a more senior intelligence man realises there must be a mole, Agent Simon effectively blows the cover he's been working so hard to build, duffing up his superior and locking him in the boot of his car. That turns out not to be as much of problem as you might think since, by then end, he is crushed under the building that collapses when Thomas opens his big magic sucky hole. Bye bye Si, then? Elsewhere, Sean and Leila, reunited, are in search of what has happened to her family. They drive from the town of her rescue (somewhere in Texas) to her home (which I presume is also in Texas, since they get there very fast) and find only a crime scene, blood stains, mysterious documents and, eventually, a conspiracy-mad former journalist who burbles a lot about seeking the truth and then reveals that the Extraterrestrials are, in fact, extraterrestrials. Which, now I say it again, doesn't seem much of a shock. The events of The Event: reviewed in brief I think we should be proud of Madeline Jackson, giving a good name to journalists everywhere \u2013 tetchy, twitchy, stuttering and paranoid. She did at least provide the definitive answer to what Sophia's people are . . . EBEs, she said (it sounded like \"eebies\"). To clarify, she said, that's \"extraterrestrial biological entities\". And then, since the MIT graduate and his girlfriend still weren't on board, she added: \"ALIENS.\" Which might have cleared up any lingering questions from last week about whether they were from the future \u2013 or at least it would if Madeline didn't appear to be utterly demented. Still, while being utterly ludicrous, there are enough questions to keep drawing us back: \u2022 What has happened to Leila's family? \u2022 What's happened to the passengers of the abducted flight? Having been dead, alive, almost dead and then reprieved, are they now safe, or just having a week off? \u2022 Just how fast does Sean drive? \u2022 Why does the (late?) Simon like water so much? \"Where I'm from there wasn't any\u2026\" indeed? And Sofia is afraid of dogs. So perhaps there are also no dogs where Sofia and her people are from. Hm. No dogs and no water? I have been puzzling this all week. Are they from a linen cupboard? Because you wouldn't want dogs or too much water in there or your sheets would get hairy and wet, so that's a possibility. The possibilities are seemingly endless. And that's why I (as you, I hope) will be back next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
