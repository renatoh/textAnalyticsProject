Not only were they smart enough to drop their first album in the quiet January of 2009, flinging it to No 1 in the process, but they're sharp writers, too. It's hard not to raise a smile at the opening line of Holy Ghost: \"You were writhing on the floor like a moth in molasses.\" Sounds like a school disco and a half. They're repeating the January trick again, but whether Ritual will match the 1m sales of To Lose My Life in Paul Gambacinni's Era of Rock Band Death is unlikely. It's a decent set, but one whose pulse remains steady throughout. Nevertheless, it perspires the influence of great British bands and scenes: Sheffield electronica, the Bunnymen, OMD to proffer a few. But it's let down by a constant grasp for profundity that the band's music and Harry McVeigh's voice aren't quite able to attain. While on the synth'n'strings ramble of Strangers, he sings, \"I got a sense of urgency, got to make something happen\", just as the listener is drawing the conclusion that this second album from the west Londoners is missing one key ingredient \u2013 a sense of urgency."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
