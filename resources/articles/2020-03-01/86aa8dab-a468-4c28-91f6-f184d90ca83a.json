A fortnight before football\u2019s coronavirus-induced shutdown, Newcastle\u2019s assistant kit man returned to work at the club\u2019s training ground with a spring in his step. Thanks to a whip-round of Steve Bruce\u2019s first-teamers, initiated by Carroll, Ramshaw had a new hip. After raising around \u00a315,000 to fund his surgery at a private hospital on Tyneside, the players were delighted to see their old friend back. Ramshaw is coy about his age \u2013 \u201clet\u2019s just say I\u2019m a pensioner,\u201d is how he puts it \u2013 but he is believed to be in his 70s. \u201cGeorge the kit man has been here since the year dot,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cThe players paid for his hip operation. It was a lovely touch. Footballers get much maligned these days but they sent him off to get it done privately. I think it might have been Andy Carroll\u2019s initial idea. Andy, of course, has known George for a long time. \u201cHe\u2019d only just come back to work in the past couple of weeks and he\u2019s all fixed and healed. It seems to have been a big success. We were all thrilled to see him back because George is a lovely, lovely man. He\u2019s as good as gold now. Before we closed down he was jumping around the place; I thought he\u2019d be playing soon.\u201d There was a time when he might have given Carroll and company a run for their money. Ramshaw was a leading amateur player, who starred for the immensely successful non-league Whitley Bay side of the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s he also represented the Great Britain amateur side, variously touring and playing in Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda and Iceland and the former Rhodesia. After hanging up his boots he moved into coaching and became assistant manager at Gateshead before joining Kevin Keegan\u2019s Newcastle in 1995 as assistant kit manager, looking after the reserves. \u201cI\u2019m eternally grateful to the players,\u201d said Ramshaw from his home in Hebburn. \u201cI was in a lot of pain with my hip and it would have been months before I could get an operation through the NHS given how busy they are. \u201cThe players said: \u2018Can we do something?\u2019 to our club doctor, Paul Catterson, and he put it in motion with the Nuffield. Within a fortnight, I was in and had it done. All the lads came together and put in. Me and my wife are both very grateful. \u201cI\u2019m feeling great now. I was off for about four months but I\u2019m back full-time now \u2013 or at least when the training ground reopens. It\u2019s champion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
