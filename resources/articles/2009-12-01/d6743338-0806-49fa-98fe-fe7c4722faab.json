I want to replace my five year old IBM ThinkPad X31 as both the processor and battery are showing their age. Lenovo claims to offer 12.1in standard laptops on its website but following the link reveals only widescreen models. I don't watch movies or play games but I do work on documents and spreadsheets in portrait format where I want more depth (or height) on the screen. To get the same screen area as the X31 with 16:10 format would need a 12.6in screen, and to get the same height, a 13.5in screen. Jem Moore Jack Schofield replies: I'm also still using an X31 ThinkPad and have the same problem. Unfortunately, 4:3 format screens have gone out of fashion and most ultramobile laptops now have 13.3in widescreens that are not as tall as the X31's 12.1in screen. Worse, the extra width means the widescreen versions take up more room. If you decide to stick with a 12in widescreen, you will lose screen height, but not screen resolution. The WXGA widescreens on the ThinkPad X200 and Toshiba Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 range typically have a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, which offers slightly more depth than the 1024 x 768 pixel XGA format used by the X31 and similar machines. On-screen text will be smaller, but screen quality has improved in the past five years, particularly with the move from TFT to LED panels. At around \u00a31,100-\u00a31,200, these machines are cheaper than the X31, and have twice the battery life, so is that a problem solved? However, if you are willing to try one of the new ultrathin machines with Intel CULV (Consumer Ultra Low Voltage) chips and 13.3in widescreens, you can get a PC with even better battery life for about half the price. Examples include the Asus UL30, Acer Timeline and MSI X340, all of which I've looked at in Technophile, plus the Dell Inspiron Z and Acer's Travelmate-badged Timelines. Ultrathin laptops usually have 16:9 widescreens with a resolution of 1366 x 768 so you will have the same vertical resolution and almost the same physical screen depth. The main point to watch is not to buy a machine with Core 2 Solo processor, but to go for a Core 2 Duo. The Wikipedia CULV page tells you which model numbers are which. Bugged by DoubleClick I frequently get searches from Google or Bing where what looks like a straightforward web address gets modified in the browser to one where \"doubleclick\" has been added. These searches invariably fail: I get a plain white browser screen and a frustrated feeling! I know DoubleClick is a well-known spyware, but I can't seem to get rid of it. I am using Internet Explorer 8 and Kaspersky antivirus protection on a Sony laptop running Windows XP Pro SP3. David Hunt JS: This is usually a spyware and/or adware problem, so run a good spyware remover, such as SuperAntiSpyware. The infection may well have changed your hosts file. You can change it back to the default Hosts file by going to Microsoft's Fix It 50267 page and clicking \"Fix this problem\". Perhaps an even better answer is to go to the Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals site and download a Hosts file that also blocks a lot of advertisements. Where an advert would appear, you'll get a panel saying that your browser cannot find the site. Basically, your new Hosts file is redirecting these sites to 127.0.0.1, which is your own computer. For example, a line in Hosts that says 127.0.0.1 google.com will stop your browser from reaching Google. By the way, DoubleClick is not spyware, it's an advertising service company that Google bought for $3.1bn. The ad-blocking hosts file should stop its ads from appearing. TV Tuner driver I have upgraded my PC to Windows 7, but the TV tuner card has stopped working and I have been told that the 64-bit version of Windows 7 doesn't support TV cards. Dave Case JS: The 64-bit version of Windows 7 does support TV cards, and Windows 7 should find a driver automatically \u2013 as long as it has been supplied to Microsoft. If a company has written a driver but not supplied it to Microsoft, then it should be available on the manufacturer's website. Not every peripheral that worked with Windows XP has a 64-bit driver for Windows 7. However, the Windows 7 compatibility list includes 163 items in the list of TV tuners with 64-bit drivers, so there could well be one for your TV tuner. Anyone planning to upgrade a PC to Windows 7 should run Microsoft's Upgrade Advisor. Running this on a 32-bit system tells you nothing about 64-bit compatibility, so you have to check for all the drivers manually. USB ports needed I hope to replace an ageing Dell Dimension desktop. I have eight USB devices so currently use six rear USB ports plus a hub. The Dell Inspiron only has four rear ports and Dell tells me that it is not possible to add any more. Is it the usual practice nowadays to rely on hubs? Andrew Patterson JS: There are still machines around with eight USB ports, an example being the HP Pavilion Elite HPE-053uk, aimed at gamers. However, you can add an extra four USB 2.0 ports to many desktop PCs by fitting an internal PCI expansion card such as the NewLink. These and similar FireWire expansion cards are aimed at users with older PCs that only have original USB ports. You may be able to reduce your reliance on USB by connecting some external peripherals, particularly hard drives, via FireWire instead. External powered hubs work pretty well for many devices, but you would have to experiment to find which of yours work best when plugged in directly, rather than via a hub."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
