Neil Entwistle, 27, appeared at a brief televised hearing at a court in Massachusetts and was ordered to be held in custody without bail until the next hearing, which was set for March 15. The defendant did not speak at the hearing, which is known as an arraignment in the US legal system, and only nodded when he was asked if he knew what the charges were. The hearing at Framingham district court began at 2pm local time (1900 GMT) and lasted less than 10 minutes. Mr Entwistle's lawyer, Elliot Weinstein, told the court that his client had entered a not guilty plea to the two charges of first-degree (ie premeditated) murder. The prosecution said they were seeking that Mr Entwistle be held without bail. Mr Weinstein said the defence did not take issue with this \"at this time\". Mr Entwistle's wife, Rachel, also 27, and their nine-month-old daughter, Lillian, were found dead at the family's rented home in the Massachusetts town of Hopkinton last month. They were shot dead on January 20, a day before Mr Entwistle, an unemployed computer programmer, left the US for his parents' house in Worksop, Nottinghamshire. Mr Entwistle was extradited from the UK yesterday and appeared in court today after spending the night in custody. He was brought to court today in a state police cruiser wearing handcuffs, leg shackles and a bulletproof vest. The defendant was arrested in London on February 9 and had agreed to be extradited. After today's hearing, Mr Weismen made a statement in which he criticised the media for its coverage of the case and questioned whether he could get a fair trial. He said he would \"vigorously, aggressively and successfully\" defend his client. Shortly later, a statement was read out on behalf of Rachel's family, the Matterazzos, in which they accused Mr Entwistle of \"betraying our trust\". Rachel's stepfather Joseph and mother Priscilla, who was carrying flowers, were in court for the hearing. The next major stage after today's arraignment hearing will be for the district attorney's office to present the case to a grand jury, which will decide if there is enough evidence to formally indict Mr Entwistle on the charges. It is possible, but not certain, that a grand jury could make a decision before the next \"status\" hearing on March 15. According to court papers released earlier this week, prosecutors allege Mr Entwistle searched the internet for information on killing people and committing suicide days before the deaths. US prosecutors also claim he looked up escort services and other websites offering help in finding sexual partners in the Boston and Worcester areas of Massachusetts. Investigators who examined Mr Entwistle's computer claimed to have found he did internet searches for information about suicide, euthanasia and \"killing people with a knife\" on January 16 and 17. Prosecutors said last week that they believed he killed his wife and daughter after accumulating tens of thousands of dollars in debt. The court has made public more than 200 pages of documents relating to the investigation. These include information about an alleged telephone conversation police in Massachusetts had with Mr Entwistle three days after the murders, when he was in Worksop. Mr Entwistle allegedly told state trooper Robert Manning that on the day his wife and daughter died he woke up at around 7am and fed his daughter before leaving the house to do some errands. When he returned, at around 11am, Mr Entwistle allegedly said, he checked the baby's room, and when he could not find her he went into the master bedroom, where he found his wife partially covered with a duvet. Mr Entwistle allegedly claimed that after realising they were dead, he pulled the covers back over them and went downstairs to get a knife, planning to kill himself. He was said to have then put the knife down because \"it would hurt too much\". Mr Entwistle then reportedly told the officer he had decided to drive to the town of Carver, around 50 miles away, where his in-laws lived, so that he could tell them what had happened. He apparently did not have their telephone number. He also allegedly told Mr Manning he had planned to use a gun belonging to his father-in-law, Joseph Matterazzo, to kill himself with, but that when he arrived here was no one at home. Prosecutors have said they believe Mr Entwistle used a .22-calibre handgun owned by Mr Matterazzo to carry out the killings, then drove to Carver to return the gun while no one was at home. According to the police affidavit released last week, keys to the Matterazzo home were found locked inside Mr Entwistle's BMW at Boston's Logan International airport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
