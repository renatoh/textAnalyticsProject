Bruce, who succeeded Trevor Francis when the club was 11th in the First Division, has inspired a spectacular transformation during his 16 months at St Andrews. His achievement in guiding Birmingham to promotion via the play-offs and masterminding survival in the top flight has been accompanied by the introduction of 21 new players. Now Birmingham's co-owner, David Sullivan, plans to rip up Bruce's current contract, which has three years to run and makes him the lowest-paid Premiership manager, and replace it with an improved version. \"He probably thinks he's done well - as he has - and wants to sit down to talk about an enhanced deal,\" Sullivan said. \"It is our intention to do that, we'll have a chat and come up with a longer and better contract for him.\" The Football Association is weighing up with Millennium Stadium officials whether to re-lay the pitch for next month's FA Cup final between Arsenal and Southampton. If a new playing surface is required, then it will be the 12th since the stadium opened almost four years ago. England have moved up two places to seventh in the Fifa world rankings. Wales enter the top 50 after an eight-year absence with a two-place leap to 49th. A planned meeting between Derby County and their suspended manager, John Gregory, has been postponed until the first week of May. Scotland manager Berti Vogts has called up Craig Burley for the first time in 18 months for the friendly against Austria on April 30.
