Ley announced on Friday afternoon that the Nabarlek, found in the Northern Territory, had been added to Australia\u2019s list of critically endangered mammals. Four frogs \u2013 the Baw Baw frog, the white-bellied frog, the yellow-spotted tree frog and the Kuranda tree Frog \u2013 have had their status upgraded from endangered to critically endangered. The minister also confirmed that three woodlands that had been delayed from receiving protection by her predecessors Josh Frydenberg and Melissa Price \u2013 in some cases for years \u2013 would now be listed under national environment laws. Woodlands are protected as a single habitat known as an \u201cecological community\u201d under Australia\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Guardian Australia revealed last year that two woodlands, one in Tasmania and the other found in both NSW and Queensland, had been delayed after farmer groups, Tasmania\u2019s deputy premier and a Tasmanian federal senator lobbied Frydenberg. The government then used a review of the impact of environment law on the agriculture industry as a reason to continue to delay their listing. The long-awaited report from that review was published on Thursday. On Friday, Ley listed Tasmania\u2019s forests and woodlands dominated by black gum or brookers gum as critically endangered, and NSW and Queensland\u2019s poplar box grassy woodland on alluvial plains as endangered. She also said the Tuart woodlands and forests of the Swan Coastal Plain in Western Australia, which had been delayed from receiving protection by Price, were now listed as critically endangered. Humane Society International, which had nominated all of the woodlands for protection, welcomed the decision and said Ley was \u201cbucking the trend set by her predecessors\u201d by acting promptly on recommendations made by the independent threatened species scientific committee. The organisation said it had been frustrated that protection had been \u201cneedlessly delayed\u201d by the two former ministers \u201cwho used a legal loophole to defer the listings on multiple occasions\u201d. \u201cRecognition of the threat status of these habitats has been a long time coming. It\u2019s very regrettable that for two of the woodlands it should have been provided years ago, and that since then impacts have continued unabated while landholder opportunities have gone begging,\u201d HSI\u2019s head of programs, Evan Quartermain, said. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s extremely refreshing to have a minister willing to accept the science and get on with the job of protecting these special places and supporting the communities where they occur. Minister Ley\u2019s decisive action will be of great benefit to our threatened wildlife.\u201d In total, the government added 34 species and three ecological communities to Australia\u2019s protected list on Friday. A further nine species had their listing status either upgraded or downgraded. The full list of changes can be found here ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
