The Oscar-winning actor, who worked with Allen on 2008\u2019s Vicky Cristina Barcelona, has said in a new interview that he is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d ashamed of starring in the film. \u201cIf there was evidence that Woody Allen was guilty, then yes, I would have stopped working with him, but I have doubts,\u201d he said in an interview with Paris Match. After resurfaced allegations of sexual abuse made by Allen\u2019s daughter Dylan Farrow, a host of actors have spoken out about working with the film-maker. Stars including Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Greta Gerwig all said they would never work with him again. \u201cI am very shocked by this sudden treatment,\u201d Bardem said. \u201cJudgments in the states of New York and Connecticut found him innocent. The legal situation today is the same as in 2007.\u201d In fact no charges were filed after Farrow accused him of molesting her when she was a child, something that Allen denies. Despite a state\u2019s attorney saying he had \u201cprobable cause\u201d to prosecute, Allen was never put on trial, a move intended to spare Dylan Farrow the trauma of a court appearance, the prosecutor said. An op-ed from Dylan Farrow in December, criticizing the hypocrisy of actors for keeping quiet over the alleged abuse from her father, led to more speaking out. \u201cI can only speak for myself and what I\u2019ve come to is this: if I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film,\u201d Gerwig said in a roundtable discussion for the New York Times. \u201cI have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again.\u201d Allen\u2019s next film, A Rainy Day in New York, is still awaiting release. Two of its stars, Rebecca Hall and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, have already donated their salaries to charity. \u201cI want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all the people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve,\u201d wrote Chalamet in an Instagram post. Bardem\u2019s response arrives after Alec Baldwin also made his defense of the director clear. \u201cWoody Allen was investigated forensically by two states (NY and CT) and no charges were filed,\u201d Baldwin tweeted. \u201cThe renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose. But it\u2019s unfair and sad to me. I worked w WA 3 times and it was one of the privileges of my career.\u201d Diane Keaton has also continued to support the film-maker. \u201cWoody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him,\u201d she tweeted in January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
