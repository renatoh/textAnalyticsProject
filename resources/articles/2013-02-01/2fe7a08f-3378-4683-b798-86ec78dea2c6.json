It's all over. The end. I am out of Emeli Sand\u00e9 jokes until 2014. The Brit awards 2013 had its moments, but sadly those moments lasted about 53 seconds in total, most of which was the clip of the Frank Ocean song and the fireworks during Muse. Still, thanks for all the comments, tweets and emails. There will be a news story from Lexy Topping coming up and an intellectually deep and rigorous critic's view from Alexis Petridis. I'll stick around here to add them to the live blog and might even throw in a few exciting post-Brits facts if you're dead lucky. Emeli Sand\u00e9's band are all playing in Robbie Williams' suit. It's all getting too meta for someone like me who so clearly lacks the required \"intellectual depth and rigour\" to cover the Brits. It's a live performance by Emeli Sand\u00e9. She's been out of the limelight since winning that album award back at 21:57, so hopefully this bit of exposure will give her career the much needed attention it deserves. How many more times will I get to make this legendary joke before the night ends? There are six minutes left so I reckon there's opportunity for three or four more ... We got bored. We asked @guardianmusic followers for Brits-related haikus. They wrote us some haikus. Here are their haikus ... The global success award (er, what?) goes to One Direction. Harry Styles is wearing a suit like he's getting married. Oh my God, what does this all mean? What is Taylor thinking? Is she back in her wedding dress? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? IT LOOKS SO SUPERFICIAL BUT ... THERE ARE SO MANY LAYERS ... WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN?! And without further ado it's time for best British album. Bryan Ferry is presenting and he's given it to ... who else? Emeli Sand\u00e9! She's been out of the limelight since presenting that award to Tom Odell back at 20:52 so hopefully this bit of exposure will give her career the much needed attention it deserves. \"I think I'm a very unlikely pop star,\" she says. And hang on ... Leyton Orient have blown their chances of getting to Wembley after an injury time Southend strike? You. Are. Kidding. Me. What kind of fresh hell is this? Excitement! It's only that Kieran Yates on the Brits red carpet earlier tonight! Marcus Mumford just looks out of place when he's not smirking at a sexist remark David Cameron is making. He needs to put that banjo back in its case and return to his rightful calling That market/meerkat confusion still going strong in 2013. Damon Albarn has presented Warchild with the special recognition award in a rare outbreak of good award decisions. Obviously the Brits is totally irrelevant when Mumfords win but TOTALLY vital and on the money when Frank Ocean does. We all know that, right? The winner of best international male solo artist is ... Frank flipping Ocean! And thank goodness for that. Frank says this is \"certainly a long way from serving fast food in New Orleans\". Can't we have a Frank Ocean performance please? PLEASE? Alt-J will get this damn party started. People are emailing me saying that Mike Scott actually wrote The Whole of the Moon. I am officially retiring from Jokes until 2018. Muse had fireworks. Swift had dubstep. Robbie had a suit too blue for most standard issue retinas. Now it's Ben Howard and he's only gone and topped the lot by bringing a bloody guitar along #ThinkingOutsideTheBox Reading the posts below, it's hard to see how Mike Scott from the Waterboys could possibly have taken issue with the \"intellectual depth and rigour\" of my writing ... still I guess you get bitter when you haven't written a good song since Dark Side of the Moon. Best international group ... as presented by someone or other ... oh, Dave Grohl ... goes to ... the Black Keys! And they can't even be arsed to do a video acceptance speech. So now you know ... Obviously the gossip pages tomorrow won't read anything into the fact Taylor Swift is performing in front of Harry Styles in a wedding dress. In other news, Swifto seems to have followed the hackneyed country signer tradition of \"going a bit Skrillex\". It's the best British single as presented by the popular double act Tom Daley and Jonathan Ross. Who does it go to? Adele for Skyfall. Adele can't be with us tonight because she's in LA (translation: wouldn't be seen dead here at the Brits after they cut her off last year). \"I won't speak for too long, so you don't have to cut off the winner at the end of the night\" says Adele. She's great. Now it's Taylor time! Is this the kind of thing that will make the next punk movement happen? I'd like to think so. But I'm pretty sure I said that in my 2012 Brits live blog and the most punk thing to have happened since then is ... Louis Smith and Jack Whitehall telling us that the best British live act is Coldplay. I tried to remain positive. I really did. I said the performances were \"quite good\". I pretended Robbie's bright blue suit was a \"talking point\". But now it's happening, that growing feeling that I want the ground to open up and swallow this awards ceremony and everyone inside it (er, sorry Caspar). Sharon Osbourne is perving over Harry Styles while his band cover Blondie and the Undertones ... it's just not right. There wasn't even any brass! Sharon Osbourne is now making jokes about Harry Styles' \"little stick ... that means his willy\" Thanks for clarifying. Now it's the award for best international female solo artist and the winner is ... Lana Del Rey. Apparently before the pop game she studied metaphysics at NYU. Well that puts Ben Howard and his \"journalism training\" in its place, doesn't it? Lana is onstage thanking people for \"turning my life into a work of art\" ... and with that sentence I officially quit journalism for ever. Thank you and goodnight. Daddy, which side did you fight on in the Great Brass Wars of 2013? Well, son, I fought on the side of TRUTH. Emeli Sand\u00e9 presenting an award to Tom Odell. She says he should \"just enjoy it\". He says he's \"happy to be at the Brits\". And you're seriously wondering why I'm filling the gaps here with Leyton Orient v Southend (2-1 to the Os now, unbelievable stuff)? This 2013 Brass trend is starting to get a little bit \"off the scale\" It's the award for best British male ... presented by the overly trousered Ed Sheeran. Seriously, could a tailor not take a couple of foot off those slacks? Anyway ... the best British male currently working in the music industry is officially ... not Richard Hawley :( It's ... Ben Howard Over my shoulder Dafydd Goff can be heard saying: \"I've never heard of this guy in my life.\" Maybe Adam Boult on my other side has heard of Ben Howard? \"No.\" Well thanks for reading my profile piece guys! The Brits has gone back to brass. It's not a trend we predicted but ... It's time to Timberlake! He's doing Mirrors in what looks like a tuxedo and a leather jacket at the same time. That's the kind of expectation-confounding pop star Timbo is. Quick update from Caspar Llewellyn Smith who is at the O2. He's not sure the atmosphere is kicking it this year ... Feels like a year where everyone's expectations are so low that there's a collective shrug of the shoulders - Mumfords, meh etc etc It's Grimmy and he's presenting the award for best British breakthrough artist ... which goes to Ben Howard! Apparently, Howard studied journalism before going into the pop game. He could have been famous like me, but he just didn't have the tekkers. Still, he's got a nice spotted Brit award, so every cloud and all that ... And the winner of best British group is ... oh wow, Leyton Orient are 1-0 up against Southend United! ... oh, er, sorry ... oh ffs it's only gone to bloody Mumford &amp; Sons Robbie Williams is feeling blue. Very blue. Almost shockingly bright blue. His suit is so dazzlingly, violently bright it blinds you to the fact there's an army of monochrome tuba players marching behind him during his rendition of Candy. We're two performances down and they've both been quite entertaining so far ... I suppose Alt-J are the token Not Shit Thing this year. Unfortunately I can't get past the singer's horrid whingey voice. says MorrisMitchener in the comments. So the only not shit thing is, er, shit? Clearly we need someone like hermionegingold to replace our cynicism. She writes: thrilled for emeli thoroughly deserved. x Let the history books show ... Mumford &amp; Sons talking about the \"creative process\" ... and they say I don't deserve a pay rise. Anyway here's the award for best British female solo artist presented by Taylor Swift ... (cue camera money shot on Harry Styles' awkward face) ... and the winner is Emeli Sand\u00e9! Really did not see enough of her last year so let's hope this gives her a bit of extra exposure for 2013, eh? \"Please welcome your host, Mr James Corden\" ... who starts enthusing about Mumford &amp; Sons and One Direction. Now we're not saying that Corden is almost utterly unbearable on every possible level, but \u2026 Adam Boult has been asking you lot who you think should host the Brits next year. Your answers? Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood. Alan Rusbridger. A hologram of James Corden. Not all together, I don't think, although that would actually be pretty incredible. Personally I think a hologram of Alan Rusbridger should host it, the real one is far too busy overseeing outstanding journalism such as what you're reading right now. And we're off with the never-not-supermassive Muse. There are fireworks. There are lasers. There are big chunky guitar riffs and strings completely ripping off Led Zeppelin's Kashmir. Note to everyone else on the bill tonight: THIS is how you perform at an awards show (so, you know, feel free to be equally ludicrous). Caspar LS has been having a Vine time of it on the red carpet (\"Vine time of it\" \u2013 this is how I earn the big bucks, guys) with this six-second video snippet The Brits red carpet coverage is on ITV2 right now and has provided us with some pretty juicy information. Calvin Harris wants Olly Murs to win an award. Robbie Williams thinks February is too cold to host an award ceremony. Ne-Yo is going to eat the food (\u201cDon't put food in front of me and expect me not to eat it,\u201d he says, for all those people who were thinking of placing food in front of Ne-Yo before they ate it themselves). Talking of food, here's a sneak preview of the posh nosh that nobody reading this blog will be eating tonight, courtesy of Lexy Topping. I know why you're all here. You want to read about the winners, the losers and the behind-the-scenes drama from one of the biggest nights in 2013. Sadly, though, I can't get Sky Sports 3 from where I'm sitting on the Guardian culture desk so I'll be unable to update you on how Leyton Orient get on against Southend Utd in the southern area final of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy tonight. Guess I might as well whack ITV on and fill you in on the Brit awards instead, then. And what a night we have in store! There will be live performances from Taylor Swift (she's good at this kind of thing), Justin Timberlake and Muse! There's everyone's favourite 2013 Brits host James Corden! And hopefully there will be some kind of controversy to give this live blog legs, like last year when they cut Adele's microphone. The Guardian music team will be out in force, of course. Kieran Yates will be scaring innocent pop stars on the red carpet. Caspar Llewellyn Smith will be cunningly disguised once more as a music industry freeloader drinking himself senseless at the best parties, just so he can selflessly bring you, the reader, some gossip. And we'll have expert pieces coming in from Alexis Petridis and Lexy Topping. To get you in the mood you can have a click on the following things \u2026 An amusing red carpet gallery from Rosie Swash full of people wearing nice frocks and ill-fitting suits (sort those trousers out Sheeran). Brits chairman David Joseph admitting that it was a bit rude to have pulled the plug on Adele last year. Ten things to look out for at this year's Brit awards by me! (it appears that the Waterboys' Mike Scott is quite the fan of my \"oeuvre\")."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
