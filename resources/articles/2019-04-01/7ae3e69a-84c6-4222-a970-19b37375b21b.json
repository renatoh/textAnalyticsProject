Boles\u2019 voice cracked with emotion as he told the House of Commons that he would no longer sit as a Conservative MP. Raising a point of order, he told parliament: \u201cI have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise that can take this country out of the European Union while maintaining our economic strength and our political cohesion. \u201cI accept I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise. I regret therefore to announce I can no longer sit for this party.\u201d While some on the opposition benches in the House of Commons applauded, one MP could be heard saying: \u201cOh Nick, don\u2019t go, come on.\u201d He had already resigned from his local Conservative party in Grantham and Stamford, where he was facing the prospect of deselection over his soft Brexit views. At the time, he told local members he was \u201cnot willing to do what would be necessary to restore a reasonable working relationship with a group of people whose values and views are so much at odds with my own\u201d. It is the latest example of the Conservatives fracturing over Brexit, after Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen quit to campaign for a second referendum as part of the Independent Group, which is applying to become the new Change UK party. Boles said he would sit as a \u201cindependent progressive conservative\u201d MP rather than join that group. The former planning minister was one of a quartet of Tory and Labour MPs who had worked for months on the common market 2.0 plan. Under the proposal \u2013 also known as \u201cNorway-plus\u201d \u2013 they wanted the UK to join the European Free Trade Area (Efta) and in that way regain membership of the EU single market. The government would have then sought to negotiate a customs arrangement to avoid border checks in Northern Ireland. Boles said last month that he had enjoyed working across the parties. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real pleasure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t pretend not to be different. We don\u2019t pretend not to have different philosophies, different priorities: and if anything we actually take some pleasure in finding out more about the others. It\u2019s been a great experience, almost whatever the result.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
