Just two matches ago the team\u2019s resurgence after a botched start to the season led Brendan Rodgers to declare his side could still reach second spot in the Premier League; now he admits a top-four finish is almost certainly beyond them. This comprehensive defeat, on the back of the home loss to Manchester United, served as a reality check for the Liverpool manager, who says success in the FA Cup is now his priority as he seeks tangible proof of progress from a patchy campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we got ourselves in a position over the last three months, very close, to then come up short in the past two games,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cBut I look at Arsenal and their bench, the world class players on the field with big talent and it shows the continual work we have to do.\u201d Like Chelsea, Manchester City and United, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side have strength in depth that Liverpool lack. That was brought into stark focus at the Emirates. With Martin Skrtel and Steven Gerrard suspended and Daniel Sturridge not fit to start, the visitors improvised but were pulverised by hosts who were sharper and slicker in all areas. Liverpool\u2019s defence lapsed frequently into chaos, their midfield \u2013 shorn of Jordan Henderson for the first half as he was assigned to Liverpool\u2019s problematic right wing-back position \u2013 did not have enough solidity or creativity, and they had neither a fulcrum nor a predator up front, where Raheem Sterling struggled to justify his valuation of himself. Two fine saves from Simon Mignolet enabled Liverpool to survive Arsenal\u2019s early onslaught but the hosts were still out of sight by half-time after goals by H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, Mesut \u00d6zil and Alexis S\u00e1nchez. Henderson converted a penalty in the second period after an impetuous foul on Sterling by the otherwise immaculate Beller\u00edn, but Olivier Giroud curled in another lovely goal in stoppage time to give an emphatic stamp to Arsenal\u2019s victory. Each home goal showcased Arsenal\u2019s qualities \u2013 speed, flair and a level of intensity that would likely have had them even higher in the table and still in the Champions League if they had shown it more regularly \u2013 and also exposed some of Liverpool\u2019s shortcomings, including rawness or inadequacy in key areas. The match looked like what it was: a clash between teams at different stages of development. Arsenal have not had to sell a top player since Robin van Persie defected to Old Trafford in 2012 and have instead splurged to blend proven talents such as \u00d6zil and S\u00e1nchez with the high-grade performers the club can now retain. \u201cSomething is happening here,\u201d said Wenger as he acknowledged that while Arsenal\u2019s seventh straight win in the league has probably come too late to truly threaten Chelsea at the top of the table, it fuels optimism for the future. Liverpool might have scored first if Lazar Markovic had not spurned a clear shooting chance and instead mis-hit a pass to Sterling. A short time later Alberto Moreno erred as Beller\u00edn put Arsenal in front with a wonderful strike. Moreno and Markovic have goofed several times this season but also displayed plenty of promise. That could be said of most of the recruits Liverpool made last summer, when they lost Luis Su\u00e1rez and tried to cobble together nearly a whole team with the funds raised. But a couple of the signings look like flops. Mario Balotelli \u2013 who, according to Rodgers, ruled himself out of the Arsenal match after suffering a mysterious \u201cknock\u201d in training \u2013 has scored only one league goal this season. Dejan Lovren has endured poor form and also an abdominal injury and was left on the bench behind Kolo Tour\u00e9, who was perhaps Liverpool\u2019s most erratic performer on Saturday. A red card for Emre Can at the Emirates, coupled with Skrtel\u2019s suspension, means that, if fit, Lovren may play alongside Tour\u00e9 in Wednesday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final replay against Blackburn Rovers. That is a prospect to be relished by Rudy Gestede \u2013 should he be fit to play \u2013 who tormented a stronger Liverpool defence in the first match at Anfield. It will not inspire Rodgers with much confidence as he pursues the first trophy of a Liverpool reign that is nearing the end of its third season. Winning the FA Cup would not, of course, give Liverpool a Champions League place and Rodgers admits that missing out complicates his efforts to close the gap on Arsenal. \u201cPlayers want to play at the top level of the game and if you\u2019re not in the Champions League it makes it difficult for you,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe showed in our season that we can still fight, be up there challenging \u2026 it\u2019s going to be a little like this until we become more stable. We\u2019ve got young players who are growing, getting more experience and then hopefully there will be a period where we qualify again.\u201d Man of the match H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn (Arsenal)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
