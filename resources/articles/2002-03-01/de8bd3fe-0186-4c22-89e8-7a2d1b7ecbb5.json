It was a quality display of compulsive seam bowling on a pitch offering, by then, bounce and pace but little else, and it took him to within 10 wickets of 200 in Tests. If there was anything predictable in a generally unpredictable Test, however, it was that Caddick did not perform to his capabilities until the second innings, despite ideal conditions. If his statistics tell a story, then they recount a Test career of first-innings mediocrity and something approaching genius in the second. It is so stark a discrepancy as to be unique among pace bowlers of similar standing - 104 wickets at an average of 36.63 in first innings as against 86 at 20.41 in second innings - and questions should surely be asked by the England management. \"That's cricket,\" he said on arrival in Wellington yesterday. \"You can sit there and pick it to pieces but the fact is that, if you look through history, there are going to be discrepancies.\" That may be true but not to that extent. Right now there are only eight pace bowlers with more wickets playing Test cricket: Wasim Akram, Glenn McGrath, Waqar Younis, Shaun Pollock, Javagal Srinath, Darren Gough, Chris Cairns and Chaminder Vaas. Only Caddick averages more than Vaas's 30.61 in the first innings, yet only Pollock can better him in the second. The narrowest differential is Wasim's shade more than five runs per wicket, 25.71 to 20.68. Take it further, though. Discounting Sir Garfield Sobers, there have been 31 seamers with more Test wickets than Caddick. Not one has a worse first-innings average, the closest being Kapil Dev (31.2) but, in addition to Pollock, only Courtney Walsh, Curtly Ambrose and Malcolm Marshall, as well as the recently retired Allan Donald, better him in the second. There was mitigation in last week's Test but this is not about one game; it is about a career where he has frustrated and delighted in equal measure. \"You tell me why,\" he challenged. \"Maybe it's because I feel it's more important in the second innings than the first.\" \"What?\" \"I don't know. Players play differently in the first innings. You've got to remember batsmen in the first innings leave me [ do not play shots] a hell of a lot more than in the second. So maybe it's that.\" But why would they treat him differently from Pollock, say, or Glenn McGrath? They leave Caddick a lot because they do not have to play and that, especially with the new ball in the first innings, is criminal. Nasser Hussain's body language should tell him that and, if the bowler thinks the second innings more important than the first, where the game is taking its shape, then perhaps the captain should know. To find out what causes a talented individual to underperform so consistently would require examination of the area between his ears. Is he insecure? Much of the foot-hold kicking and ground stamping that follows a bad ball is to try to deflect criticism. \"It's not my fault,\" he is saying. Is Caddick responding negatively to a level of expectation? In Christchurch wickets were demanded when, in Gough's absence, he was leader of the pack for the first time. Was it too much to ask? Is he worried about failure in such circumstances rather than thinking about success? Certainly his finest bowling came when he took seven for 46 in the first innings of the Durban Test two winters ago, after Hussain had ground out a marathon 146 on a flat low pitch and nothing but hard graft was expected by the England bowlers. The pressure to succeed was not there. In Christchurch Hussain, then Hoggard and finally Graham Thorpe and Andy Flintoff, put England into an unassailable position before he tagged along. People tend to remember the last act. Is Caddick like the painter and decorator who applies the top coat after somebody else has done the rubbing down and applied undercoat? Only he may know the answer. And you can bet he does. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
