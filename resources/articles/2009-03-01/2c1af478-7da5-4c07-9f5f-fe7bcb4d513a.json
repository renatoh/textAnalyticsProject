And I've never forgotten that muffled, mighty, death-dealing boom, the feeling of nameless dread it gave me in the pit of my stomach. When I heard that two young soldiers had been murdered by dissident republicans in Antrim on Saturday night, I experienced that familiar internal lurch. And together with thousands of others, I muttered the same familiar, hopeless prayer \u2013 Oh God, please not again. Here in Northern Ireland we have grabbed at peace like there's no tomorrow, flinging up fancy bars and glossy shopping centres with more haste than taste, so great was our thirst for normality after the dark years of the conflict. We've been overcompensating wildly, talking ourselves up no end, and all the while we've been colluding in the same comforting fiction: that Northern Ireland has undergone a radical and complete transformation, morphing almost instantaneously from shambling, war-torn and intrinsically sectarian pariah state to \"world class\" destination. We've been discussing how we deal with the historical legacy of the Troubles, as though the few short intervening years of shaky peace had made the past safe to handle, stripped it of its capacity to harm us. And we've been worrying about normal things, like the economic downturn or the advent of water taxes or the future of post-primary education. In short, we've been behaving like Northern Ireland is a normal place. It isn't. The Antrim shooting has forcibly reminded us of that. There have been warning signs - a rash of failed attacks, the police in flak jackets again, a bomb scare in Belfast's posh new shopping centre, Victoria Square. (Stuck in the resulting traffic jam, I had to explain to the kids what a bomb scare actually is. Depressing in itself.) Of course, the new Northern Ireland isn't going to dematerialise overnight because of the events in Antrim, bleak and bloody as they are. But the fear is there again, among the vast majority of ordinary people who were onlookers to the Troubles, the people who just kept their heads down, trudged on and hoped that it would all somehow, sometime end. That old sense of helplessness is back. We're scared too because we know how events have the capacity to snowball wildly out of control in Northern Ireland. We're reminded of the fragility of the devolved administration at Stormont, haunted by the late Conor Cruise O'Brien's warning that while the North might see episodes of non-violence as each generation of its warring leaders ages, a political system defined by religion can never achieve lasting peace. The Antrim shootings are odours from the abyss. They are a reminder that we cannot afford to be complacent, because chaos and anarchy are not put \"beyond use\" in a storybook past. They are lurking just under the surface, volatile in the here and now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
