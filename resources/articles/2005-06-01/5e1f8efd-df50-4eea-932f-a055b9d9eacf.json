The former Tory party treasurer who, in his buccaneering days, boasted that no one \"would ever get a handle\" on him, is to chair a soon-to-be floated company called Bombshell. This freshly minted \"shell\" company (ie it does not yet contain an operating business) is aiming to \"invest in either one or more quoted or unquoted businesses\", according to a terse announcement issued yesterday. We learn that its \"investment targets may have been set up by entrepreneurs who have good strategic plans and need financial backing\". Oh, and \"Bombshell's activities will be located in the English-speaking world ... \" and it will \"focus its search [for suitable investments] on the business and consumer services sectors\". To get things going, \u00a33.2m has been raised - a little under three-quarters of which has been supplied by Lord Ashcroft personally - and the company should join the Alternative Investment Market on Thursday week. That, bar a few other bits of waffle, is as much as we are being told. The shell flotation game might have been expected to die down on Aim - what with White Nile fever and the more general bursting of the speculative bubble which developed on London's junior stock market this year. But Bombshell is bound to attract attention, and not just because of its snappy name. Lord Ashcroft has interesting form, even if it is difficult to access the real returns enjoyed by investors who have backed his previous ventures. (Anyone who bought into his core quoted vehicle, Carlisle Holdings, six years ago has lost at least half their money. They would have done better buying in late 2002, since mid-2003 the price has essentially travelled sideways.) More importantly, London's punting community will notice that Bombshell's nominated financial adviser is Cenkos, a firm recently formed by Collins Stewart co-founder Andy Stewart, who has installed himself and some old-school broking friends in the former City offices of Cazenove at Tokenhouse Yard. In an effort to stop Aim getting clogged up with dormant shells which never seem to do the deals investors are promised, the Stock Exchange recently tightened up the rules, requiring new shells to raise at least \u00a33m and then to arrange an acquisition within the space of a year. Lord Ashcroft's latest venture will no doubt meet those rules - but it is not in the man's style to offer anything more than the rules stipulate. Regal dilemma Still on the subject of Aim, we're expecting the latest instalment of the Regal Petroleum saga today, with the likely resignation of Bill Humphries from the board. Humphries, a mining veteran, is the non-executive who earlier this week forced the resignation of Regal's colourful chairman, Frank Timis, following news that the company's much-hyped oil prospect in Greece turned out to be a dry well. This, in turn, caused collateral damage across a large part of the junior market as contagion set in among amateur punters trading on margin to play a range of pumped-up resources stocks. Some were expecting Humphries to become chairman himself at Regal, but he is understood to have set down a series of conditions, including a seemingly reasonable demand that the company carry out a full review of all its oil and gas properties. When these conditions were not met at a board meeting yesterday, Humphries said he was off. Where this leaves the company (and its share price) is anyone's guess. If it is the case that the two remaining executives, finance director Roger Phillips and production director Rex Gaisford, cannot stomach an examination of Regal's assets, that is very worrying. For a start, investors who stumped up \u00a345m in new cash for Regal six weeks ago will need reassuring the money is still there. Hard pressed All good reporters know they should write the story rather than become it. Well, yesterday the newspaper industry as a whole became part of the story. Official data showed that one of the principal causes of a sharp decline in manufacturing output in the three months to April was another sharp decline in the sale of newspapers. It may come as something of a surprise that newspapers rank as a component of the country's manufacturing sector, but we do in fact fall neatly into the statisticians' \"pulp, paper, printing and publishing\" category, which suffered its worst fall, of 3.7%, in a quarter of a century. Within that category, newspapers and periodicals were especially weak in the latest three months and, for newspapers alone, there was a decline in sales of \u00a379m in the month of April alone - the worst since records on newspapers alone began eight years ago. Along with falling chemicals and electronics output, newspapers were responsible for the biggest quarterly fall in manufacturing output for nearly three years. \"Newspapers are in long-term decline,\" a statistician for the Office for National Statistics informed us, helpfully."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
