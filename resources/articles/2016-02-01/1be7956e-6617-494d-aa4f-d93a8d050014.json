As a former West Ham player, however, Slaven Bilic is taking nothing for granted. Nineteen years ago, he was part of the side that lost in the fourth round of the League Cup to Stockport County, Iain Dowie ending a grim eight-game run without a goal by crashing a calamitous header into his own net, before they followed it up with a third-round exit from the FA Cup at the hands of Wrexham a month later. Bilic was able to recall the fury that spilled from the Upton Park terraces after Kevin Russell\u2019s 25-yarder in the 90th minute won the replay for Wrexham. \u201cThe first game we played it was 1-1 at Wrexham and I didn\u2019t play because my son Leo was born on that day,\u201d West Ham\u2019s manager said. \u201cIt was 4 January 1997. I was in hospital and Hugo Porf\u00edrio scored exactly in the minute when my son was born. The replay here, it was one of the really bad memories. There were police on horses and all that, because the fans wanted the chairman to sign a striker. \u201cWe were struggling. We weren\u2019t conceding a lot of goals but we couldn\u2019t score and then Wrexham came and they scored at the end of the game, a great goal from 25 yards. After that we signed Johnny Hartson and Paul Kitson and we stayed up.\u201d These are different times. West Ham are pushing for a European place and they recently convinced their best player, Dimitri Payet, to extend his contract until 2021. However, while Bilic would not go as far as comparing the Stockport and Wrexham defeats with Saturday\u2019s game against Blackburn, West Ham travel to Ewood Park depleted by injuries. With Andy Carroll ruled out for two weeks with a groin strain, Enner Valencia struggling with an ankle problem and Diafra Sakho not due to return to training until Monday, Emmanuel Emenike is set to start up front for the first time since his loan move from Fenerbahce, while Michail Antonio is likely to fill in at right-back because Joey O\u2019Brien and James Tomkins are injured and Sam Byram is cup-tied. Bilic was full of praise for Blackburn and noted that 61% of their goals have been scored from set-pieces. West Ham could switch to a back three at a ground where Stoke City and Swansea City met a grisly end in the Cup last season. \u201cMake no mistake, I am expecting a very tough game and it wouldn\u2019t be a big surprise if a club like Blackburn, at home, beats a Premier League side in the FA Cup,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cIt\u2019s happened many, many times before.\u201d A year ago, West Ham\u2019s season unravelled after losing 4-0 to West Bromwich Albion in the fifth round. That was the beginning of the end for Sam Allardyce and while Bilic has far more credit in the bank than his predecessor, the Croat knows better than most that West Ham rarely like to do things the easy way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
