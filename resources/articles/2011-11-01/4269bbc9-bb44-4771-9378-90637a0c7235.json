Beckham's contract with the MLS club expires next month but the 36-year-old is determined to continue playing at least until the 2012 London Olympics, at which he hopes to captain the Great Britain team. Beckham has met Tony Fernandes, the QPR owner, but a club executive said: \"We do not think it is likely now. Also Neil Warnock is not completely sure where he would fit into the team.\" Asked if Beckham's financial requirements may be too steep the executive said: \"Actually I think he thinks we are too small a club.\" Jamie Jackson Scottish Premier League A professional performance returned three points and a brace for Nikica Jelavic, as Rangers \u2013 down to 10 men for the last few minutes after Gregg Wylde was sent off \u2013 moved 12 points clear with a 3-1 defeat of Dundee United at Ibrox.

Agencies Fifa The Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, has promised to name names as part of the anti-corruption drive he hopes will reform the governing body. Blatter, who has set up a number of anti-corruption panels to monitor behaviour, will explain more fully how Fifa intends to clean up its act in a speech on Monday. In an interview with the website insideworldfootball, Blatter said: \"It takes time to shake the tree until all bad apples have fallen to the ground.
