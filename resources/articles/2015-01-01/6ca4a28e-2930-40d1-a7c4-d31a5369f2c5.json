About 350 of the deaths were among patients who had not been diagnosed or given medical treatment quickly enough. Another 150 were not admitted because of bed shortages, even though their condition meant they would usually have been found a place on a ward. The College of Emergency Medicine\u2019s figures have raised concern that growing turmoil in A&amp;E units, and hospitals generally, is doing real harm. Dr Clifford Mann, the college\u2019s president, said its estimates were based on international studies which show that patients who arrived at emergency departments when hospitals are overcrowded were at greater risk of dying. \u201cIt\u2019s sobering that up to 500 patients a year die because too many of our emergency departments are too often overcrowded. It\u2019s a cogent reminder to the people who run the NHS that overcrowded emergency departments are just unacceptable and dangerous,\u201d he said. A&amp;Es in England were busy about 25% of the time, he added, which meant that 3.5 million patients who turned up at an A&amp;E department each year were at slightly increased risk of death. Applying the results of studies from Australia and Canada showed that up to 350 A&amp;E patients with a range of serious illnesses, who ended up waiting longer for admission than the supposed NHS maximum of 12 hours, would die, Mann said. Although the exact reason is not clear, delays in diagnosis and vital treatment, such as surgery or antibiotics, are thought to explain most of the deaths. The remaining 100-150 deaths are among patients who turn up at A&amp;E and would usually be admitted, but are sent home because the hospital has run out of beds. Mann said: \u201cWe know that mortality rates for a whole range of conditions are higher when A&amp;E units are overcrowded, compared with when they aren\u2019t. There\u2019s an increase in mortality rates for patients when they are admitted from overcrowded emergency departments. We are talking about a relatively small increased risk, but it\u2019s an absolute risk that we should be concerned about.\u201d In a November 2013 report on reform of urgent and emergency care services, NHS England accepted that overcrowded A&amp;Es do carry an increased risk. \u201cCrowding in A&amp;E departments is a growing threat to patient safety and can have a significant impact on all patients,\u201d it said. NHS statistics show that the number of patients waiting between four and 12 hours to be admitted, and the numbers waiting for more than 12 hours, both rose significantly during 2014. NHS England said: \u201cUnprecedented numbers of patients are accessing services, and staff are dealing with the highest-ever number of 111 and ambulance calls, A&amp;E attendances and emergency admissions. \u201cDemand is highest in winter as more people suffer from serious illnesses, especially respiratory conditions, and there are as a result more deaths at this time of year. This is why we have worked hard to minimise unnecessary delays in urgent care and prioritise those patients at greatest risk. This has included injecting some \u00a3700m into the NHS to help bolster services with an extra 700 doctors, 4,500 nurses and more than 3,000 24-hour GP services, 999, 111, A&amp;E and community and social care services.\u201d The shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: \u201cThese figures suggest that patients are paying a terrible price for this government\u2019s decision to slash social care support, which is a root cause of the continuing A&amp;E crisis. Without the vital services that help elderly and disabled people with the basics of daily life, like washing, eating and going to the toilet, many can\u2019t cope and end up going to A&amp;E or getting stuck in hospital. Labour\u2019s bold plans to fully integrate local NHS and council care services will ensure services work together to prevent people reaching crisis point, or to get them back home quickly, reducing the strain on A&amp;E departments.\u201d Ministers are being warned that the NHS is facing a \u201cdisaster\u201d of ever-increasing bed blocking because social care is \u201cchronically underfunded\u201d. In a letter to the Observer, an alliance of local councils, NHS organisations and charities says more beds will be occupied by patients trapped there because the services they need after discharge are falling victim to cuts. \u201cThe health and social care system is chronically underfunded. While this remains the case, care and support for elderly and disabled people will only deteriorate,\u201d they say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
