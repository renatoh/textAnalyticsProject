At least two things, however, remain exactly the same: the ornate 19th-century Sirkeci rail terminus, where a portrait of Ataturk hangs over the mahogany desk in the station master's immaculate office, and the passion for football. Forty years ago I was fortunate to be staying with my uncle, a professor at Istanbul university. He loved Turkey and its people, and quietly made it his business to relieve me of any of the invidious cultural prejudices that might have infected a young western mind. He showed me the rare tomato-coloured faience in the little mosque by the Spice Market; he took me to eat swordfish at a restaurant on the Galata Bridge; he drove me along the Bosphorus to the Black Sea, past the ancient palaces and forts; he played me his recordings of Asik Veysel, the old blind troubadour of Anatolia; he pointed me in the direction of Troy; and he took me to a football match. It was in the Inonu stadium, not far from his apartment in a modern block just down the hill from Taksim Square. Looking over the Dolmabahce Palace and across the Bosphorus to Uskudar, this is the only football stadium in which one can sit in Europe and look upon Asia. We watched Besiktas, the home team, a bunch of city slickers representing a club founded in 1903, struggle against the tall, raw-boned country boys of Eskisihirspor, established only three years earlier in an ancient Phyrgian town 200 miles south-east of Istanbul. I forget the score, but I remember the frustration of the fans of the Black Eagles, as Besiktas are known. At the final whistle my uncle suggested that we waited a few minutes before leaving, in order to witness the ritual of the burning of newspapers on the concrete terraces, a spectacle not to be seen at English league grounds. So I was not entirely surprised, some 24 years later, to discover the emotions unleashed by the arrival of Manchester United at the stadium of another Istanbul club. This was the time Alex Ferguson's men were greeted at the airport by a man holding a tattered piece of brown cardboard bearing the words \"Welcome to the hell\", lettered in black felt-tip pen. The following evening, as the home supporters arrived three hours early at the Ali Sami Yen stadium and set about building a wall of noise, United's players and fans learnt the meaning of that message. And if they still hadn't got it, the local police re-emphasised it with their truncheons before the night was over. For many years Turkey was a nation that loved football but had no international standing. Orhan Pamuk, the great contemporary Istanbul-born novelist, recalls \"crowds of men smoking cigarettes after the national football matches, which during my childhood never failed to end in abject defeat.\" That changed first with Galatasaray's Uefa Cup victory in 2000 and then two years later when the national side reached the semi-finals of the World Cup and went on to beat South Korea in the third-place play-off after Hakan Sukur, their most famous player, scored the fastest goal in the tournament's history straight from the kick-off. Following that ecstatic high, the failure to qualify for Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup came as a serious blow. Now in their third year under Fatih Terim, however, Turkey seem to have discovered the secret of hanging on. In just under seven hours of football in their four matches since the tournament began two and a half weeks ago, they have spent a total of nine minutes in the lead. And that has been enough to see them through to tonight's semi-final. The wild adrenalin-fuelled desperation driving Turkey's last-gasp victories could seem to reinforce a stereotype. But it might be as well to remember the words of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of George I's ambassador to the Sultanate, writing home from Constantinople in 1718: \"Thus you see, sir, these people are not so unpolished as we represent them. 'Tis true their magnificence is of a different taste from ours, and perhaps of a better. I am almost of opinion they have a right notion of life; they consume it in music, gardens, wine and delicate eating, while we are tormenting our brains with some scheme of politics or studying some science...\" At a time when Ataturk's secularist state is under attack, Orhan Pamuk fears the success of the football team is being misused as a vehicle for nationalist sentiments, and he may be right. But three centuries on from Lady Mary's adventures, you can almost hear that fragrant traveller joining in the current football chant. En buyuk, Turkiye, they shout as they wave their red flags: Turkey, the greatest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
