The defender is keen to link up there with Pep Guardiola, who managed him at Barcelona. Alves\u2019s agent had a meeting with Juventus on Monday and made the club aware of his client\u2019s desire to move on. He is awaiting the go-ahead from the Italian champions to begin talks with City. Discussions are also planned with Chelsea but Alves\u2019s preference is to move to the Etihad Stadium. Alves, 34, won three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues during Guardiola\u2019s four years in charge at the Camp Nou, between 2008 and 2012. The Brazilian is full of admiration for the 46-year-old, something that was made clear in an article he wrote for the Players\u2019 Tribune website in the buildup to the Champions League final this month. \u201cIf you turn the word \u2018computer\u2019 backwards, it spells \u2018Steve Jobs\u2019. If you turn the word \u2018football\u2019 backwards, it spells \u2018Pep\u2019,\u201d Alves wrote. \u201cHe is a genius. I\u2019ll say it again. A genius.\u201d Alves has one year remaining on his contract at Juventus having moved there from Barcelona on a free transfer last summer. He initially struggled to make an impact in Turin and last November sustained a broken leg in a defeat at Genoa, which appeared to have brought his time at the club to a premature end. But Alves recovered and went on to excel for Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s side, proving an important figure in their clinching of another Serie A title and run to the Champions League final, where they lost to Real Madrid. City believe a bid of around \u00a35m may be sufficient to secure a transfer and should they sign Alves it would be the club\u2019s third acqusition of the summer, following on from that of Bernardo Silva from Monaco and the Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
