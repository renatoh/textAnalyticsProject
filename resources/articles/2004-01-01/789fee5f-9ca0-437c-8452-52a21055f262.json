The 39-year-old woman was attacked in Clissold Park, Stoke Newington, north London, and stabbed repeatedly on December 5 last year. Her life was saved by a female hospital doctor who happened to be walking nearby at the time. The medic stemmed the flow of blood with a muslin comfort blanket belonging to one of her children. The teenager charged today lives locally but cannot be identified for legal reasons. Police have ruled out a link with the murder last February of US citizen Margaret Muller, who was killed as she jogged in nearby Victoria Park, north London. Detectives initially believed the two incidents were linked, but Detective Chief Superintendent Jon Shatford said today that investigators no longer held that view. \"The attempted murder of a jogger in Clissold Park was so similar to the murder of Margaret Muller in its execution that for the purpose of the investigation they were assumed to be linked until proven otherwise,\" he said. \"After a painstaking and thorough investigation, I can now conclude that despite distinct similarities they are not linked.\" \"As such the investigation into the murder of Margaret Muller will continue,\" he added. Both attacks occurred in busy parks, and neither victim appeared to have been robbed or sexually assaulted. Margaret Muller, who was 27, had lived in the UK since 1998 after studying at the Slade School of Fine Art in London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
