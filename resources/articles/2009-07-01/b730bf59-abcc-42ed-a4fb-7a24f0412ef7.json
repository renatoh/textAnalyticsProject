Insurers were among the risers as Teun Draaisma, the respected strategist at Morgan Stanley, raised his rating on the sector from neutral to overweight. He spotlighted Legal &amp; General, up 4.32p to 61.38p, saying concerns about its solvency had been overdone. Morgan Stanley said the market was currently implying a negative value for L&amp;G's UK life business, which the bank calculated was worth \u00a32.6bn. It added that the move by Resolution on Friends Provident should highlight the value to be found in L&amp;G. Overall Draaisma remained neutral on equities but added: \"We believe our bull case is becoming more likely than our bear case.\" Goldman Sachs also made positive noises, saying it anticipated a \"sustained rally\" in the US equity market in the second half of the year. There are some analysts and dealers who believe the market has run ahead too quickly, but they were in a minority yesterday. The FTSE 100 added 54.87 points to 4443.62, helped by an early rise of around 50 points on Wall Street. News that US lender CIT may have avoided bankruptcy was a positive influence on shares, especially financial stocks. Lloyds Banking Group closed up 4.51p at 72.01p in anticipation it could announce a first-half profit early next month, while Royal Bank of Scotland benefited from the general upbeat mood, rising 1.39p to 39.79p. Miners moved higher in the wake of firm metal prices. Kazakhmys climbed 52p to 737.5p, while Rio Tinto added 79p to \u00a322.33 after Cazenove placed an outperform rating on the company. But Caz hurt medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew, which fell 10.75p to 440.75p as the broker cut its recommendation from outperform to in-line, on the basis that a sustained swine flu pandemic could lead hospitals to focus on freeing up space for patients and to cancel orders for S&amp;N's devices. Flu fears also hit British Airways, down 3.2p to 132.8p. Housebuilders were in demand as mortgage lending hit a six-month high. Bovis Homes climbed 22.25p to 439.25p, with UBS raising its rating from neutral to buy. Taylor Wimpey rose 2.75p at 37.5p and Barratt Developments was 9.75p better at 174.5p. Finally Synchronica, the Aim-listed mobile email and data specialist, ended about 1% higher at 2.625p after an upbeat trading statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
