I'm the guilty one' says Ranieri", "bodyText": "Claudio Ranieri admitted Chelsea had \"lost the plot\" in the final 15 minutes and he accepted the blame for his team's collapse. The Italian's tinkering seemed to undermine the advantage Chelsea held after Monaco were reduced to 10 men early in the second half and he took responsibility as his side conceded two goals in the final 12 minutes. His comments came as it emerged that Chelsea's owner Roman Abramovich and chief executive Peter Kenyon travelled to Vigo in recent days for a meeting with the Porto coach Jose Mourinho which was cancelled but will be rescheduled. Events here will have strengthened the feeling among Chelsea's hierarchy that they are right to search for a new manager and Mourinho is their No1 target. Ranieri threw on Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink as a third striker after Andreas Zikos was harshly dismissed at 1-1 but Monaco took control and he introduced the centre-half Robert Huth at right-back. \"I was trying to win the match and I put on three strikers and then we lost the plot,\" Ranieri said. \"It's my fault. I accept this. After 30 years in football I know this. I'm the guilty one. With one player more I wanted to win the match and I tried to continue to have the match under control. \"Everybody wanted to do something but in the wrong way. Everybody wanted to run with the ball without playing one or two touches and pass the ball to the strikers. They were very, very nervous in the last 15 minutes.\" Monaco's manager Didier Deschamps agreed that the introduction of Hasselbaink had helped his side. \"The fact that Chelsea had one more striker was beneficial in the end to us,\" he said. \"I knew our defence was very strong so I kept two strikers to score goals and this is what happened.\" Ranieri described the second half as the worst he had experienced in his time at Stamford Bridge and said his team now had only a 20% chance of progressing to the final. He believes Chelsea will need their finest performance of the season at Stamford Bridge in a fortnight. \"Our biggest mistake was that we wanted to win the game too much,\" he said. \"Without doubt the worst 45 minutes I have experienced in charge of Chelsea. It was like 10 Chelsea players against 11. It's not easy to score two goals against this Monaco side and also they're used to scoring. Only the best performance could help us.\" Deschamps rejected Ranieri's suggestion that Monaco were now clear favourites to reach the final. \"Claudio Ranieri is a very clever coach because he knows how to pressure his opponents,\" he said. \"I wouldn't say it is 50-50 but 51% to our advantage.\" He promised not to come to Stamford Bridge intent only on keeping a clean sheet. \"We're not only going to defend,\" he said. \"Attack is going to be very important.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
