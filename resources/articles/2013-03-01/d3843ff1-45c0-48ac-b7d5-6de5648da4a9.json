I'm not sure if that was supposed to happen but it has, cue the confetti. Robinson Cano is your World Baseball Classic MVP - he hit .469 (15-32), two homers, six RBIs, six runs scored and two doubles. That does it, the WBC is over. It will be back in 2017 with qualifiers actually coming in September 2016 unless they alter the schedule - so there isn't as long a wait as you may think. There's still a ways to go, but the WBC continues to make an imprint and draw fans - 11% more attended than the previous tournament according to MLB. A bit of tinkering and some risk taking could really take it to another level, but for now, it's great to see a global baseball tournament being played on a large scale. Thanks for joining our coverage of the 2017 WBC Final. For all of our sports team at the Guardian, I'm David Lengel, goodnight from the Brooklyn basement. The Dominican Republic are enjoying the fruits of their labor, medals, smiles, some good camaraderie - obviously there is a real bond between them, especially when they perform Rodney's arrow ceremony he uses when closing out games. There's only one reason why we are here. We are here to represent our country and we need to take this thing back home. Dominican Republic manager Tony Pena on what he told players before the WBC Puerto Rico are getting some silverware before the gold is placed around the necks of the Dominican. Fernando Rodney tells Tom Verducci that the plantain is going to take four years off, and if it's available he will bring it back again. The Dominican Republic roll through the tournament - they're the first team to be undefeated in WBC competition thanks to a well rounded ball club with a lights out bullpen. This win is going to the whole Dominican Republic because they were hungry Jose Reyes Rodney is way too much for Figueroa - he strikes him out! The Dominican Republic have won the 2013 World Baseball Classic!!! They mob the mound, waving flags in celebration to the tune of air horns and drums. Aviles moves to second as the ball sails to the backstop via Santana's glove, a wild pitch. The count is 2-2. Rivera is caught looking - that ball initially looked outside to me but it clearly caught the corner on the replay after seeing the replay. Puerto Rico are down to their final out - here is Luis Figueroa and all of his 18 career at bats to face Fernando Rodney. Two down, one on. Rios pops to second. One down for Rodney here in the ninth. Rivera is up. Aviles faces Fernando Rodney and is on base after Tejada couldn't handle his ground ball at third base - so we have a lead off runner again for Puerto Rico. What will they do with it this time? Here is Alex Rios. Fernando Cabrera is now on for Puerto Rico trying to keep their deficit at three runs - he makes easy work of Encarnacion, who had the big hit all the way back in the first inning, Edwin goes down 4-3. Miguel Tejada can't do much better, he skies to right field. Now Cabrera faces Cruz who also flies to center, and it looks like the DR are keen to get to the top of the ninth. It's Aviles, Rios and Rivera for Puerto Rico as they look to rally. Beltran doesn't make much of his at-bat, flying out to left field, so just like that, there are two down, with that lead off runner still standing on first base. Here is Yadier Molina who was psyching up his teammates in between innings. He goes quietly, 1-3. They're down to their final three outs. The 6'6\" righty Jose veras warms up for the Dominican as Falu is called out on strikes - that inside fastball is just owning PR tonight. Here is Carlos Beltran. Casilla against Pagan who is 1-3 tonight and he walks him. Just how Puerto Rico wanted to start this half inning with the meat of their order coming up. Falu is up next. Big play, Cano grounds out to second. Inning over. PR are running out of time here. Top of the lineup coming up for Puerto Rico - Pagan, Falu and Beltran. They will face Santiago Casilla, now pitching for DR. Aybar pops out to second, just what Cedeno needed there. They should probably walk Cano here, even though it's a lefty lefty matchup, even though Encarnacion burned them on this earlier. They are pitching to him. Reyes adds a triple to his double, blasting it to center field, sliding into third for no reason whatsoever other than you get the he enjoys dirt. Costas criticizes the DR for celebrating, \"as they have all game\". Costas, what the hell is wrong with you? Will you leave these guys alone? This is how they do it, OK? There are other ways of doing things on planet earth besides your way. And here's the thing, I kind of agree with him, but still, because he won't just leave it alone I have no choice to back the Dominicans. Luis Figueroa is at 3B for Puerto Rico while Xavier Cedeno is on the hill. He K's De Aza and will face Reyes with one down. You've got to go with the Puerto Rican right? Miguel Tejada makes a tough catch in foul ground in the bullpen area - he was off balance and came down awkwardly and he may be hurt. Regardless, inning over for PR - they strand two and have six outs left to make it happen. Strop has them chasing windmills as the 39-year old Valdes, who I am told by Costas played in the Mexican League last year, is down on strikes. Now PR's threat is on life support. Feliciano needs that big two out knock. Does he have it in him? Carlos Rivera is caught looking - come on son, take your bat off your shoulders! One down, here is Pedro Valdes, pinch hitting for Andy Gonzalez who was 0-2 tonight. He did a good job in relief tonight: Burgos 4.2IP 5H 1R 1ER 1BB 5K 0HR What can you say - he kept his team in the ballgame, and now that Dotel walked Rios, the tying run is at the plate in the seventh. Tony Pena has seen enough - with two on and nobody out he's going to get Strop. Here comes Puerto Rico. Aviles leads off with a sharp base hit up the middle and Alex Rios is at the plate. Pedro Strop is warming up in the pen for DR. The plantain has been eerily quiet thus far. Big out there - Sierra couldn't check his swing, and De La Torre has his 12th K of the WBC and his team out of trouble. Now Puerto Rico need some runs. Santana walks and here comes Edwin Rodriguez to get Burgos. Jose De La Torre, who has had plenty of work in the WBC, is the new pitcher - he's got a fire to put out with two out and two on - he's really got to get Moises Sierra here. Encarnacion grounds out 6-3 and here's Miguel Tejada, the old raisin of the DR at 38, bats in place of Hanley Ramirez who left the game with an issue with his thumb. He hits a rain maker, not that we need any more, to shallow right and that's two down. That brings up Nelson Cruz who is without a hit in this game. Against Burgos he hammers a ball to deep center field - it one hops the wall and Cruz cruises into second base so now the Dominican have a two out runner in scoring position with Carlos Santana at the plate. That brings out Ricky Bones to have a quick chat with his man. Falu pops to center, Beltran grounds out to first, then Molina hits a comebacker to Dotel. It's a 1-2-3 inning for the journeyman pitcher as Puerto Rico start to count their remaining outs. The Dominican hurler is done, Octavio Dotel is in. Deduno: 5IP 2H 0R 0ER 3BB 5K 0HR Exactly how they drew it up in the clubhouse. Come out, get a few runs, get to the pen. It could not have gone more according to plan. Terrific outing by the kid. Cano fles to left, with some momentary confusion before Feliciano puts it in his pocket to retire the side. The DR have another run heading to the sixth, with their monster bullpen ready to shut down Puerto Rico. Falu, Beltran and Molina coming up. RUN! De Aza is around third base and into home as Erick Aybar laces one down the right field line - his RBI double puts the Dominican up three runs! Yes, they should have tagged the lead runner. Even Reyes may not have scored on that hit. Here comes Cano looking to do more damage with a two out runner in scoring position. Sierra strikes out against Burgos, who has been great, and then De Aza lays down a bunt and reaches first. That brings up the chirpy Jose Reyes, who has a mic on him and is doing his thing for the audience. He grounds out 4-3, but Falu might have had a chance to tag the lead runner. He should have done that. Let's see if that comes back to burn Puerto Rico - Aybar at the plate for DR. MLB Network shows us shots of Angel Pagan's disapproving look at Deduno's spin move coming off the mound after retiring PR's center fielder. Both Caribbean teams play this game with a lot of, well, exuberance. I can't believe that Pagan would start caring about that stuff now, all of a sudden. Take it easy fella, you swung at a bad pitch. It's more like a music video than a baseball game with both sides creating background ambience that can only come from the Caribbean. Pagan swings at a ball in the dirt and PR squander their best chance yet at getting some runs on the board. Inning over. Sierra, De Aza and Reyes due up for the DR. Deduno walks his second batter of the inning and Feliciano joins Rios on the base-paths. That brings up Angel Pagan in what is the biggest at-bat of the night. There's a visit to the mound by DR manager Tony Pena. Tom Verducci of the MLB Network spoke with the grounds crew and apparently the worst of the weather is gone - they feel good about getting nine innings in tonight, good news. He hits a long drive to center but De Aza, on the run reaches out and makes a supurb catch to save a run! Phenomenal work by the White Sox CF, and that's the second out and a killer for Puerto Rico. Feliciano has a hit in this game and is now seeking an RBI knock. Rios walks to start the inning for Puerto Rico and then takes second on a Deduno wild pitch. Carlos Rivera then pops out to center after a delay to work on the mound, as Bob Costas continues to tell us how much in other countries care about the WBC, which is true, but we KNOW THAT ALREADY. OK, so one down for Andy Gonzalez with a runner in scoring postion. Let's see what he can do. Cruz and Santana go down on strikes, and Burgos K's all three Domincan's in the fourth. The two-run first for DR remains the difference in San Francisco. You know what they say - you can't argue with logic. Encarnacion is back at the plate and he whiffs at a curve ball this time. Meanwhile, MLB Network had some sound between the home plate umpire Ted Barrett and an official briefing him on the weather and it was not good at all. Hanley Ramirez is next, and he pops one into center that a charging Angel Pagan can't get to, a base hit. Had Ramirez put in a little bit of effort he could have been at second base. Instead he is at first with one out for Nelson Cruz. I'm sure the Dodgers fans loved watching that one. Aviles hits a rope to center but it's right into the glove of De Aza, that's three down. Inning over. This game will be official soon, and decisions will have to be made here. They can't call this thing for a while...can they? Now there's more talk rain and about injuries and teams being concerned etc. Forget it man, this is the final. Enough already with this. Deduno, whose command, it is said, can be at times, wanting, walks Beltran on four pitches. So Puerto Rico have a lead off runner on for the first time since the first...no they don't. Molina grounds into a double play! What on earth is going on here? It goes down 3-6-3, and just like that, it's two out, no one on for Mike Aviles. The rain is picking up. Costas says that if it were a normal game they would have stopped already. I believe Costas. Cano lines to left, inning over. Bob Costas says it can be an official game after as little as 4.5 innings if the rain knocks out the final, which would be a shame. Jose Reyes takes it easy on Burgos, lining out to Feliciano out in left field before Aybar drops a single into right field, and the DR have a one out baserunner for Cano, who was walked intentionally back in the first inning. Ayabr is picked off! Right as MLB Network gives us an extended shot of the DR dugout! Wow, now that's directing! The replay looked good anyway, Rivera putting on the sweep tag. Two down, and here comes the rain. We here at the Guardian welcome your contribution. Join in the conversation, be part of the 2013 World Baseball Classic blog, now, please. Thank you. @lengeldavid or email david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com Irving Falu can't get Feliciano home, grounding to the pitcher - Deduno tosses to first, and he has three scoreless innings under his belt. Andy Gonzalez is out after catcher Carlos Santana pounces on his gronder and fires to first, then Jesus Feliciano has a knock to left. Angel Pagan is back up to hit, and for the third time this tournament we get the story of how Pagan was a bat boy in the Olympics. Then they talk about how the USA was suprised because they didn't realize just how much other teams cared. Sigh. Anyway, Deduno throws one in the dirt, a wild pitch, which sends Feliciano to second, but Pagan grounds a 3-2 pitch to Robinson Cano at second for out number two. Feliciano moves to third, 90 feet away from being Puerto Rico's first run. Burgos is just what the doctor ordered for Puerto Rico. He gets the Dominican 1-2-3 as Carlos Santana bounces out 4-3, Moises Sierra pops out to center and Alejandro De Aza strikes out. Now lets see if they can solve Deduno. The hook is out early here as Hiram Burgos replaces Giancarlo Alvarado - he has soe good numbers in the Brewers system. Alvarado did not have good numbers - 1IP 2R 2ER 2H 1BB 0K Mike Aviles gets Puerto Rico's second inning going with a pop up to the catcher in foul ground. That brings up Alex Rios, who had the big blast against Japan on Sunday night. Swing, miss two down. That leaves it for Carlos Rivera to solve this Deduno, the Twins prospect who seems to have whatever it he has tonight. Rivera does no better is also down on strikes, that's four total if you're keeping score at home. Alvarado puts one in the dirt and away from Molina and that allows Encarnacion to advance to third base but Cruz pops out to end the inning. You get the feeling it could have been worse for Puerto Rico. Just in case Reyes, Aybar, Cano and Encarnacion aren't enough for Alvarado, here comes Hanley Ramirez with a runner in scoring position and one down. Luckily for team Puerto Rico, he skies to Alex Rios in right, where is all the action has been thus far. Two down now for Nelson Cruz. RUNS! Encarnacion makesem pay! He launches a slider deep into the gap in right-center field, and that will bring home Reyes and Cano. Big start for the Dominican Republic! Jose Reyes leads it off for the DR and crushes it to right field off the Levi's Landing and the Blue Jays shortstop has a double, following that up with the usual Reyes crazy stuff. Erick Aybar lays down a perfect sac bunt and just like that Reyes is at third with one down. Tough situation already for Giancarlo Alvarado, and the wheels are turning. Robinson Cano is walked, and he will take his chances with Encarnacion, who only had 42 homers last year up in Toronto. Two on, one out. Steve JinSoCal writes... \"Beamed around the Globe\" he says... Not here in the US of Bloody A. As a Baseball nut expat who'd be watching this at home on MLB Network (or more likely ESPN Deportes), I'm stuck in a hotel here in Orlando that doesn't have either. Meanwhile ESPN is all over f**king March Madness and spotty faced oiks playing basketball... get a proper College education I say... Grrr\" There was more, but we'll cut it short there and say that we're glad we can help you out Steve! hang in there. Molina is gone on three pitches, a back door breaking pitch shocks Molina and anyone who has watched him play throughout the years. He is miffed at the umps decision, and will have all game to discuss it with him while catching Puerto Rican hurlers. That's the inning, here come the Dominican. There's a little roller that Deduno picks up on the first base line - he throws to Edwin Encarnacion at first for the out, Pagan is at second base, while Carlos Beltran is at the plate. The former Royal, Astro, Met, Giant and current Cardinal whiffs, and so it's up to his teammate, Yadier Molina, who always comes through in these situations, to do it again with two outs. Pagan gets it going for Team Puerto Rico to the delight of the PR crowd - it's a single to right field. Since the two teams have similar cheering customs, I suspect we will hear the same things on every play. Man on for the Royals switch-hitting second baseman Irving Falu. You were wondering if all this pre-game coverage was some sort of joke. maybe there's no WBC final. Maybe the WBC doesn't even exist. Maybe baseball isn't real! Fear not, it's all happening. Finally. Samuel Deduno's first pitch to Angel Pagan is a ball, high and away. We're off. I came into Bob Costas' weather spiel a bit late, but I think I heard him say that if rain ends this thing after 4.5 innings, that's it. Let's hope we don't have to deal with that sort of horror-show. Here is a better angle of the opening ceremonies. I swear, first pitch is coming soon. Pomp and circumstance in San Francisco, and deservedly so. It's been a phenomenal tournament, and will get better down the road. I don't have much experience with the Dominican national anthem or the Puerto Rico tune, but it seems like the tuxedoed up orchestra did a decent job...I think. If anybody out there knows if that was a butchering or a decent crack at it feel free to let me know. For now I'll give a 7/10. John Goldstein writes \"The long few weeks between the Superbowl and the start of the Baseball season are very nearly over. I'm watching one of my usual hacked streams and I'm looking forward to some new adverts from Chattanooga. Feet up, beer in hand and away we go.\" Brian O'Hara says \"When Dominican wins, how and where in Punta Cana will the celebration be Wednesday?\" No idea, put i'll take your prediction. Send yours to @lengeldavid or david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com before it's too late. Here is a link to where the game is being broadcast around the world. We had some classical anthem performed on the field and now we're getting warmer with something a bit more like what's happening down in the Caribbean right now - Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic muisc as the players walk down the line. Much much better. If only they could bring some of those crowds gathering around the DR and PR to watch this final to AT&amp;T Park. The tournament is being beamed around the globe, and has been a ratings success in many nations. However, right now in San Francisco, it looks half full at best. It's worth mentioning that the starting pitcher is limited to 95 pitches tonight, as they have throughout the Championship Round in San Francisco. If Samuel Deduno gets anywhere near that the DR will be in great shape because their bullpen is lights out. That's their key, get to that pen with a lead because then it's over. For Puerto Rico, it's naturally get those runs early before it's too late and hope your starter does what he's done earlier in the WBC. I like Puerto Rico here - they're on a roll, albeit, not as hot as the undefeated Dominicans, but it's hard to lose to a team three times in one tournament, a theory that's borrowed a bit from the NFL. First pitch is around the corner. Remember, tweet your thoughts to @lengeldavid or emaildavid.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com There was some talk about rain but we may be able to get out of this thing without any delays - fingers crossed that happens. As it has been the last two days, it's much cooler than these teams have been used to. Some fun facts. Apparently MLB TV have been at the pre-game for three hours - that is a very very long time. It's not quite Super Bowl territory but it's a decent chunk. No wonder they were talking about Team USA, there was obviously time to fill. They are not here, and so, we should not be talking about them. However, it is worth mentioning some excellent ideas that the MLB Network team were throwing around, including making it mandatory for selected players to report, like it is at the All-Star Game. Sensible. Also sensible is to make them a 31st team, letting them report to training camp as a club, allowing them to travel the circuit and play games. These are a few steps that could possibly help. The other is for them to care as much as everyone else. No matter how much anyone denies it, they just don't. That's not neccesarily their fault, it's just the way it is. Puerto Rico 1. Angel Pagan, CF 2. Irving Falu, 2B 3. Carlos Beltran, DH 4. Yadier Molina, C 5. Mike Aviles, SS 6. Alex Rios, RF 7. Carlos Rivera, 1B 8. Andy Gonzalez, 3B 9. Jesus Feliciano, LF Seventeen days after the World Baseball Classic began in Fukuoka, Japan, and some 37 games later, we're finally ready to crown a new champion at San Francisco's AT&amp;T Park. A tournament with no shortage of storylines brought us a new one on Monday - plantain power. Fernando Rodney's new good luck charm was out and about vs the Netherlands in their WBC semi-final game, helping to propel his Dominican Republic to the brink of their first ever title in the tournament - not a bad night for a starchy banana. The D.R.'s beefy lineup, loaded with lumber (three players with a 1.000+ OPS), didn't break through until the fourth inning, putting up a crooked number after falling behind by a run in the first. There would be no additional theatrics by the valiant Kingdom, which provided viewers with plenty of drama during a competition littered with upsets. Hensley Meulens' Dutch were finally dead, ousted by the team they sent home early in 2009. The underdog theme continues however, with Puerto Rico fresh off their win over two-time champions Japan, carrying momentum into the final. They'll need it, having failed to beat their regional rivals, the Dominican Republic, twice in this tournament. Puerto Rico look to the San Francisco Giants' Angel Pagan, carrying a .941 OPS in the tournament, to drive their lineup, with Giancarlo Alvarado, who plays his pro-ball in Japan, getting the ball for his Puerto Rico. He's put up a 2.16 ERA in 8.1 innings of WBC work. It ain't exactly Koufax vs Gibson tonight, with the D.R. entrusting Samuel Deduno and all 21 of his big league starts in the final. It's worth mentioning however that the 27-year-old, hardly a household name, held the USA to one run in four innings his last time out, so don't be fooled by that lack of experience, as the American's seemed to be. In a World Baseball Classic filled with intrigue, I'm wondering if any surprises are left in store. One thing we do know is that whichever team wins tonight's game, it will be the greatest sporting victory in that nation's history, which is quite a testament to the tournament. We'll have first pitch for you shortly - there's still a few moments to cook up some La Bendera, plantains, crack open an Estrella and prepare yourself for an evening of b\u00e9isbol latinoamericano as we get set for the third WBC final.
