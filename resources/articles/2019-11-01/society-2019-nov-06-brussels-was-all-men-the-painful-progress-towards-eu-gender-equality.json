There was just one female commissioner,\u201d she says. Fast-forward 27 years, and Ursula von der Leyen is the European Commission\u2019s first female president. When it was first announced, in September, the incoming commission was set to be the most gender-balanced in EU history, with 13 women and 14 men, but that has now changed to 11 women and 13 men so far confirmed, and three commissioners-designate still to be confirmed. Meanwhile, a record number of women are now European parliamentarians, with women holding 286 out of 751 seats (39%). But Maycock, secretary general of the European Women\u2019s Lobby, which speaks up for women\u2019s rights on behalf of more than 2,000 European women\u2019s organisations, is in no mood to celebrate. Progress towards equality has stalled in many countries, including the UK, according to the latest report from the European Institute for Gender Equality (Eige). \u201cProgress, if you can even call it progress, is extremely disappointing. There\u2019s no single EU country that has achieved equality,\u201d says Maycock. \u201cWe need concerted efforts by all EU member states to take measures \u2013 and an end to austerity. \u201cWe expect now a full, ambitious political strategy to tackle equality between men and women, which has been in the EU\u2019s values since the very beginning.\u201d Across Europe, even in the Nordic countries that lead the way in gender equality, unpaid care and family responsibilities still fall overwhelmingly to women. More women than men work part-time, creating not just a gender pay gap but a gender pension gap as well. Austerity has made women\u2019s positions worse. The Gender Development Network identifies a triple-whammy of blows to gender equality across Europe: when there are cuts to public services, women make up the shortfall through unpaid care work; women are hit harder by cuts to public sector jobs; and women are often left juggling household budgets as prices rise. All three mean women lose out on time for paid employment, political activity or leisure. They also put further pressure on women\u2019s health. But uprooting deeply embedded gender stereotypes is hard, even in apparently progressive countries like the UK, which is the fifth most gender-equal country in the EU. Bj\u00f6rn Sieverding, a board member of the Network of European LGBTIQ* Families Association, is from Germany, which ranks 12th in the most recent index compiled by the European Institute for Gender Equality. He cites two of his friends, a heterosexual couple expecting their first baby: in theory, the husband was open to taking his share of childcare, but ultimately he was afraid to take even 80% of his leave because he was concerned about how his colleagues would view it. Even more worrying is the lack of action to tackle violence against women. In Brussels itself, just last month a fast food company posted an ad on social media in which a man was shown punching a woman for handing him the wrong burger. The comic-book image provoked outrage. Belgian equality minister Nawal Ben Hamou described it as sickening and totally irresponsible. The ad was taken down, and the Dutch-owned company apologised. But as Dagmar Schumacher, director of the Brussels office of UN Women, points out, ads don\u2019t get made by just one person. \u201cIt is so shocking that in 2019, in Brussels, a group of people approved this,\u201d she says, questioning how everyone involved in the process let through an image that legitimises violence against women. It\u2019s a source of frustration to Eige that there are so few Europe-wide statistics on violence against women. But the organisation does not want that to hold up political action. \u201cWe want violence to be as visible as other issues,\u201d says senior Eige researcher Jolanta Reingarde. \u201cWe can\u2019t compare data or look at what has happened since 2012, when we did our last survey on violence against women, because there is not enough information. There is enough, though, for politicians to take action.\u201d As the new European commissioners take up their posts, Maycock agrees that it is time for clear political action on gender equality. \u201cThe previous commission just had a working paper, and that doesn\u2019t have the political weight,\u201d she comments. \u201cWe need real political weight. [EU] ministers for sport meet six times a year. Ministers for fish, I\u2019ve lost count. But ministers for equality never meet.\u201d Despite the slow progress, Maycock remains positive. \u201cWomen themselves are bringing issues to the attention of decision makers,\u201d she says. Over the coming life of the commission, women will be looking for action \u2013 for gender equality to be part of everything the EU does, not just left to informal meetings. The European Institute for Gender Equality paid for train journeys and accommodation in Brussels for the reporting of this story. This story was amended on 6 November to reflect the changes in the number of women confirmed as commissioners for the incoming European Commission."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
