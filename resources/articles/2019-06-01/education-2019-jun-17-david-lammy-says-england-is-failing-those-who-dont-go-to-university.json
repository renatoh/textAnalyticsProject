Lammy said he has grown \u201cmore sceptical of the miracle of mass participation in universities than I was as a younger man\u201d. While he wouldn\u2019t want to return to just 8% of the population attending university, as would have been the case when he was born in 1972, he urged the government to pay more attention to vocational routes. His focus has now turned towards young people who don\u2019t go to university, partly because of the lack of opportunities for them, but also because they miss out on a transformative experience, Lammy said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about a young man growing up in Sunderland, how he relates to a young man growing up in Tottenham. I don\u2019t think they do \u2013 it\u2019s very hard to meet if they don\u2019t go to university, big divides can be built there,\u201d he said. In his time as higher education minister, Lammy recalled \u201cvirtually anything I said would make it into the Guardian, but as apprenticeships minister, not so much\u201d. He attributed this to the fact that middle-class parents don\u2019t see vocational training as a valid option for their children. \u201cWe haven\u2019t cracked it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old A-level gold standard remains.\u201d He cited Germany, Australia and Finland as models to follow. The government\u2019s recently published Augar review of post-18 education and funding set out a new vision for England\u2019s higher and further education system that, if implemented, would rebalance spending away from universities and towards vocational and technical education. The report described a disparity between the 50% of young people who go to university and the rest that \u201csimply has to be addressed \u2026 [as] a matter of fairness and equity\u201d. Lammy added that young people graduating from university do not always secure as good jobs as they should. \u201cYou find that there are students from non-traditional backgrounds \u2013 of course some black and ethnic minorities but also many [white] working-class students \u2013 who get to university and [\u2026] this promise they were sold, isn\u2019t quite what it says on the tin.\u201d As well as doing a disservice to people who are not interested in academic study, Lammy said that England is failing people from less privileged backgrounds. He said that most academic evidence supports the idea that \u201cthe young Somali girl\u201d from inner city London who gets 3 As is brighter than her more privileged peers who get A and 2A*. He noted that university access data reveals that geography is as much of a fault line as class or race. \u201cTwo London boroughs, Richmond and Barnet, send more kids to Oxbridge than the entirety of Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester combined,\u201d he said. \u201cThat gets to the bigger questions in this country, circa 2019, behind Brexit [\u2026] about class and about geography [which] just continue to go largely unaddressed, and that is a scandal.\u201d Echoing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s recent vow to drop the language of social mobility in favour of a more egalitarian concept of social justice, Lammy said he is \u201cfar more interested in what is the good society, and how can everyone have a piece of that good society\u201d, than in using universities to fast-track a handful of people from disadvantaged backgrounds to the elite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
