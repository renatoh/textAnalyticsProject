On Saturday Manchester United were allowed to put in far too many balls unopposed. Most of those came from Gary Neville, who had so much time and space he must have thought it was his birthday. Indeed, a 1-0 scoreline might look close but it was a big 1-0. On another day Paul Scholes and Ruud van Nistelrooy would have got four or five, mainly from crosses. Brian Clough used to say if you stop the cross you stop the goal, but too many teams ignore that. I'm not sure whether enough of the ugly part of defending goes on these days, with players happy to get hit in the face to stop a shot or cross. Sometimes players get to within five yards of an opponent and think they are putting them under pressure. A yard is a mile to a good player like Gary Neville. Leeds never got in Neville's face. A lot of that was because when the ball went wide to Darren Fletcher, James Milner sprinted back to go two-on-one with Salomon Olemb\u00e9 Leeds then had no one picking up Neville. And then,instead of looking to go past Olemb\u00e9, Fletcher would just wait for his full-back to move up and slip a pass to him. Then Neville could put in a cross into the danger zone under no pressure. Once Leeds saw that scenario they should have adjusted. I think they should have told Milner to stay closer to Neville, who would have found it harder to get in a cross and would have been forced to play a ball back into midfield. Leeds could have done that without leaving Olemb\u00e9 one against one with Fletcher. Seth Johnson could have dropped back to help Olemb\u00e9. Although he would then leave Phil Neville unmarked, either he could have made shuttle runs towards Phil Neville if the ball was played or Dominic Matteo could have come out from defence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
