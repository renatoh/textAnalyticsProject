That, at least, is the charitable interpretation of the fracas over Railtrack. The transport secretary, Stephen Byers, deliberated in secret for two months, then suddenly decided to put most, but not all, of its assets into administration. This triggered such an outraged reaction from shareholders that it has drowned the usual complaints about how badly the railways are run. It all confirms the deeply flawed structure of privatisation. Shareholders were happy to wallow in the huge rise in Railtrack's shares in the early days and to accept dividends which the financially stricken company should never have paid out, yet now they want to be compensated when things go wrong. Whatever happened to risk capitalists? Some are, bizarrely, demanding that the government buys the shares back at the original purchase price. The truth is that equity capital has no place in an organisation like Railtrack. At the end of last week the value of all its shares was only \u00a31.4bn. Yet the government is to invest \u00a330bn over 10 years. Any benefits of such huge sums should accrue to the taxpayer, not the shareholders, because without public money the company would not exist. The only benefit of privatisation would have been if private sector management had been so good it would have more than offset the downside of private ownership (higher interest rates and the need to pay out dividends). In the event, private management proved to be worse than what went before, not least in project management, where the west coast link has more than tripled in cost. It gets worse. If it ditches the shareholders the government will find that the private sector, which is still scheduled to cough up \u00a330bn over 10 years, will increase charges even further because they will factor a higher \"risk premium\" into their costs because there won't be a presumption that the government is an implicit guarantor. The alternative of using more public, not private, money is attractive because government can borrow much more cheaply. The catch is it would count as government borrowing and so be opposed by the Treasury. Then there is still the problem of trying to integrate the railways once again after the disastrous experience of fragmentation. Railway privatisation is turning out to be one of the worst decisions of its kind ever made. But the worst may be yet to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
