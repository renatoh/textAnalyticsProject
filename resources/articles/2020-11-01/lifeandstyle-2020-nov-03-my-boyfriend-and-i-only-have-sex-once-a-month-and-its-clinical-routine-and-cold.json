I am a 30-year-old woman and he is 10 years older than me. We started our relationship long distance, but had a passionate sex life. However, since we moved in together, we only have sex once a month, sometimes not even that. When we do have sex, it\u2019s always in the same position, and it\u2019s quite clinical; it has to be at the same time every week and if we miss that time, we don\u2019t have sex. I have never reached orgasm with him. He does not like to kiss passionately and tends not to look at me during sex. There is never any foreplay. I have told him bluntly how I feel, but he says that talking is just making the problem worse. I love him very much and our relationship is generally good, but I feel frustrated and rejected. I don\u2019t want to write off my sex life at 30. You are still at a stage of learning about each other and assessing what a long-term relationship might be like. So far, you have discovered that the passionate connection you originally enjoyed has not survived the transition to cohabitation, and that is a red flag. However, there is always a plateauing or even a reduction of erotic engagement when people have increased access to each other \u2013 they may become sexually complacent or even lazy. But this doesn\u2019t mean they love their partner less \u2013 it is just that a level of comfort sets in and the excitement of rare encounters is missing. Sometimes this can be rectified by trying to reproduce situations in which you had great sex \u2013 perhaps kissing in a car or sex in a hotel. You have choices to make about what you need in the future. You may decide to walk away, but it would be smart to be patient for now, because things could improve \u2013 even without his willingness to address it. At this time of Covid, one must consider that the stress of quarantine, financial insecurity and general depression or anxiety about what is happening in the world is negatively affecting sexual appetite and expression for many people.
