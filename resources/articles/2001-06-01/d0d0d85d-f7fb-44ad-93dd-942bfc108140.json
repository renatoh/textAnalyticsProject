The review will be undertaken by the Whitehall performance and innovation unit (PIU). It will shortly announce that it is to conduct a six-month scrutiny of the legal and regulatory framework of the charitable sector, following hard on the heels of the McFadden commission in Scotland. The unit's findings could result in far-reaching legislative changes. Led by Geoff Mulgan, the PIU operates out of the Cabinet Office at the behest of the prime minister and the Treasury. Its reports are seen to reflect government policy and often form the basis of a white paper. Margaret Bolton, head of policy at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), is to be seconded to work on the review. The PIU is confirming that an announcement of the review is imminent. A spokesman says: \"It will look at what regulation there is now, whether it is delivering what is needed and if there are other instruments that can be used. Issues such as governance and the role of the charity commission will be reviewed. The general feeling in government is that this area needs to be looked at. We will try to provide a framework to put the sector on a sounder footing and to make it more robust.\" The charity commission has long faced criticism - both within and outside the sector - for low public confidence in charities. It has been accused of failing to curb high fundraising costs, and over-aggres sive fundraising techniques, and of allowing charities to get away with not returning their annual accounts. One of McFadden's recommendations was that its proposed Scottish charity commission should de-register charities with excessive fundraising costs. The English commission has also been charged with reluctance to take a lead on initiatives that could rebuild public confidence, such as an accreditation scheme ranking charities by efficiency and performance. In a survey last year, two in three people said they would welcome league tables to help them make informed decisions about which charities to support. A key reason for the PIU review is thought to be the central role expected of the voluntary sector in delivering the government's social inclusion agenda in its second term. There are suggestions that the prime minister himself has called for the review to ensure that charity law is effective. The PIU spokesman says: \"Most charity law has been on the statute book for a very long time, while there have been huge changes in the sector. Many bigger charities have become multi-million pound businesses and charities have become involved in delivering frontline services.\" The Directory of Social Change (DSC), the voluntary sector research and training body, is welcoming the review as \"badly needed\". It claims the charity commission is undermining the government's drive to involve more grassroots organisations in service delivery by taking a \"draconian\" new approach to those seeking to start charities. \"While we have a government that seems to recognise the value of self-help, it is sad that the charity commission, of all bodies, should appear to be moving in the opposite direction,\" says Mike Eastwood, DSC director. \"We have called for the commission to look again at one of its fundamental responsibilities to encourage, rather than put off, those seeking to help each other in their local communities.\" The review will involve widespread consultation with the voluntary sector and will coincide with the results of NCVO's own consultation on the idea of a \"public benefit\" test to determine charitable status. This would allow any organisation to register as a charity provided it could demonstrate it was working for the benefit of the public. Stuart Etherington, NCVO chief executive, says: \"A review of charity law and regulation is long overdue. We welcome any move by the government which gives serious consideration to our own policy recommendations.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
