How has it come to this?", "bodyText": "The Dutch describe Advent as de donkere dagen voor Kerstmis. It means the dark days before Christmas and, for Sunderland, they can never have felt shorter or bleaker. The winter solstice may just have passed, leaving the earth starting to tilt towards the sun once again but, at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light, there can be no guarantees that spring will bring a rebirth of warmth and brightness. Sunderland are preparing for Bolton\u2019s Boxing Day visit sitting almost as low in League One as the winter sun which, on Monday, struggled to break through the December gloom to shine weakly on what remains their top-end Premier League-class training facility, the Academy of Light. Phil Parkinson\u2019s side are 13th \u2013 the lowest position in their sometimes illustrious history \u2013 with the manager deemed under pressure barely two months after succeeding Jack Ross. If it seemed dubious at the time, hindsight has made the decision to sack Ross, with the team sixth in the table and within touching distance of the automatic promotion places, look increasingly poor and panicky. The problem was that the intelligent, talented Scot \u2013 who was swiftly snapped up by Hibernian \u2013 had narrowly missed out on taking Sunderland to the Championship last season and fears of another failure perhaps clouded the judgment of the owner, Stewart Donald. Parkinson has a decent body of work behind him, doing very good jobs at assorted clubs including Bradford \u2013 remember that wonderful run to the League Cup final? \u2013 and Bolton, but he tends to start slowly and Sunderland are a club in a desperate hurry to return to the Premier League. Right now football\u2019s promised land looks an awfully long way away and, with Donald having recently taken a \u00a39m loan from FFP \u2013 a company consisting of a small group of American investors with close links to Michael Dell, of Dell computers \u2013 the future is shrouded in uncertainty. Should Donald fail to repay that loan, FFP would take charge of a club which, not so long ago, was put on the market for \u00a3170m by its former owner, the American billionaire Ellis Short. While this could be a very good thing \u2013 if Dell were to get involved Sunderland would gain heavyweight financial muscle \u2013 nothing is guaranteed. After all, the training ground is in the upmarket Cleadon area of Sunderland and occupies precisely the sort of invitingly large site which property developers would relish turning into expensive luxury homes. Meanwhile the team itself has turned distinctly downmarket. A recent picture of two players, the former Celtic winger Aiden McGeady \u2013 since transfer-listed and working with the under-23s following a \u201ctraining ground incident\u201d \u2013 and Chris Maguire tucking into a post-match meal at a McDonald\u2019s on the way back from a 1-0 defeat at Gillingham appeared emblematic of plummeting standards. So far Parkinson has presided over only two wins and has, damningly, said: \u201cIs it the greatest dressing room I\u2019ve been part of? Probably not.\u201d Following a disappointing 1-1 home draw with Blackpool this month, Parkinson swerved post-match media duties, claiming \u201che needed a break\u201d but he was back facing the microphones and endeavouring to be as upbeat as possible on Monday. \u201cThis is a critical period for us,\u201d said Parkinson, reminding everyone that his side are only six points off a play-off place. \u201cIn the next block of four games we have to aim to get back into the top six or pretty close to it.\u201d Flags at the Stadium of Light have been fluttering at half-mast since Friday when Billy Hughes, a vital attacking spark in Sunderland\u2019s 1973 FA Cup-winning team, died at the age of 70 and a minute\u2019s silence will precede kick-off against Bolton. The crowd is likely to be significantly down on this time last year when a 46,039 gathering shattered the League One attendance record by filling the stadium for a 1-0 Boxing Day win against Bradford. Back then Sunderland seemed set fair for automatic promotion with Josh Maja scoring freely but the January transfer window saw the young striker sold to Bordeaux and the team\u2019s fortunes have never properly recovered. Despite a tight budget, Parkinson hopes to redress the balance next month. \u201cI know what I need to be successful,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m working hard to get this team into a position where we can challenge. We must get more out of the players but, of course, we\u2019d also like to improve the squad.\u201d The boardroom has recently been fortified by the appointment of two new non-executive directors, the North Yorkshire-born, Sunderland-supporting Sky Sports presenter David Jones and Tom Sloanes, a Wearside-born businessman, but whether or not celebrations are in order before the summer solstice will be principally down to Parkinson\u2019s players. His USA international, Lynden Gooch, not only believes Sunderland can rise to the challenge but disputes claims the dressing room is divided. \u201cIt\u2019s a good group of lads,\u201d he maintains. \u201cWhen Jack Ross was here he changed a lot and got a lot of good lads in; now we\u2019ve just got to stick together. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot, especially missing out on promotion by one win last season, but we\u2019re still aiming to go up automatically. If you put three wins together on the bounce you\u2019re in the top two, that\u2019s how close this league is. \u201cYou can\u2019t get too down because you\u2019re not going to get any success if you do that. Phil Parkinson hasn\u2019t really had too much time on the training pitch to properly implement what he wants but we know we\u2019ve got the quality. We\u2019ve just got to keep plugging away and things will turn.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
