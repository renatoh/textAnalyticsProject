The trouble was that Rusedski was not back yesterday, and hence Luxembourg, like San Marino against England in Graham Taylor's days, went 1-0 ahead, although on this occasion it was less of a shock. Playing Arvind Parmar in the opening singles instead of Rusedski was a calculated risk by the team captain Jeremy Bates. Parmar, who was beaten 4-6, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 by Gilles Muller, suggested afterwards that the Luxembourg No1 was, on occasions, prone to being \" very flaky and mentally weak\", which coming from the British No3 was pot calling the kettle black with considerable audacity. Tim Henman quickly turned matters around with a routine straight-sets victory over Gilles Kremer, ranked No888 in the world, and today will join forces with Rusedski in the doubles. Rusedski will also be available, if the worst should come to the worst, to play in the singles tomorrow. And today's doubles may not be totally straightforward, for the British No2 has not played a competitive match since January. Parmar has a reputation of losing from winning positions, one that he is valiantly attempting to slough off. Unfortunately this defeat served to emphasise the gulf in class between Henman, Rusedski, and what may be politely called the rest. It was Rusedski's lack of match practice, coupled with the chance to test Parmar's resolve after his horrible five-set defeat in the deciding match against Ecuador in 2000, that persuaded Bates, making his debut as captain, to gamble. With Parmar leading two sets to one, the risk appeared to have been justified, although what Bates will now have surely learned, assuming he did not know it already, is that Parmar, who is 26, is not the man to replace Rusedski when he retires next year, as seems likely. Parmar has lost in the Davis Cup against two players substantially his junior. Four years ago it was Giovanni Lapentti, then 17. This time it was the 20-year-old Muller. Such defeats are not mere coincidence. Parmar is a player of limited range and ability who is no more inclined to attack the net and volley than he ever was. And he does not have the weight of shot to trouble many from the back of the court. Muller, a left-hander with a double-fisted backhand, quickly established a 4-2 lead in the opening set and then lost his way, principally because of some woeful volleying. This was not tennis of distinction by either player; indeed it was typical of the nervy play that this competition so often engenders on the opening day. The indoor stadium in the former mining town of Esch-Alzette, about 25 minutes from the city, is small and seemingly unknown by the inhabitants, many of whom greet inquiries of its whereabouts with a blank gaze. The hall is claimed to hold around 1,000, although 600 would be nearer the mark. Stylistically, it holds some quaint interest, with the architect apparently having modelled the beams supporting the roof on the arches of the Tyne Bridge. When Parmar won the third set it seemed he might have bridged the Davis Cup divide. John Crowther, chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association, whirled a rattle with nationalistic fervour while around him the Bats yelped with delight. Then, midway through the fourth set, Parmar needed treatment to his left thigh and, although it did not appear to trouble him and he made no excuses, his game subsided rapidly thereafter. Henman, watching on the press room television, was so relaxed about his own match that he slipped away only towards the middle of the fifth set and then trounced Kremer 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. Britain will surely clinch the tie tomorrow to set up the opportunity for another crack at getting back into the world group in September. For that, a fit Rusedski will be an imperative."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
