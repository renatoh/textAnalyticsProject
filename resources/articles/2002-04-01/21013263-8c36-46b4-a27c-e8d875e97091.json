Since the ignoble demise of the Spice Girls, the bottom has dropped right out of the girl-group market. Precious, Girl Thing, Cleopatra, Daphne and Celeste, 21st Century Girls: all vanished overnight. Girl groups are pop's own disappeared, dissidents in a totalitarian phallocracy ruled by Westlife, A1 and Blue, remembered only by their tearful mothers. But Atomic Kitten appear too strong to silence: they keep on chalking up the hits. Nevertheless, the prospect of seeing them live is disheartening. It is a given that any successful pop group will have a couple of hits that are, at the very least, insidiously catchy. In Atomic Kitten's case, these are the number one ballad Whole Again and their cover of the Bangles' Eternal Flame. The panic sets in when you realise that these tracks account for only eight minutes of an hour-long concert. How will they - and, more importantly, you - fill the rest of the time? The answer is with anaemic disco-house numbers and a handful of makeweight ballads, none of which possess Whole Again's chart-charming insistence. Interest is momentarily piqued during a cover of Kool and the Gang's Get Down on It. The group's male dancers perform a bewildering routine that involves lying face down and pounding the stage with their fists, as if in receipt of an unreasonable tax demand. The rest is just padding, every song a polystyrene nugget encasing the hits. It doesn't matter. The audience comprises mostly pubescent girls, who could be no more enthusiastic if Atomic Kitten were pointing loaded guns at them and demanding they applaud. They wear flashing deely-boppers, wave frantically at the band and unite in uniquely nerve-jangling screams throughout. It is like being trapped in an enormous school bus on the last day of term, a situation only a pervert would consider desirable. Atomic Kitten's appeal to their youthful supporters is apparent throughout. They perform slightly laboured comedy routines and end the mawkish Eternal Flame by blowing raspberries. Their own dancing smacks less of strenuous rehearsal than an evening spent chugging back Bacardi Breezers at the local Ritzy. The truth is that Atomic Kitten are not a pop band. They are three peroxide Cillas-in-waiting, lucratively killing time until an ITV contract is theirs. If that happens, Atomic Kitten could still be around long after the preening boyband himbos have ceased to dominate the charts."}, "isHosted": false}}}
