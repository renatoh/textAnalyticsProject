Interest in the debacle has pushed Martin Meredith's biography of Mugabe to the top slot. It has also boosted sales of Zimbabwe's Plunge , by Patrick Bond and Masimba Manyanya, and of the autobiography of the man Mugabe sidelined in the independence struggle, Joshua Nkomo. Chinua Achebe's classic, Things Fall Apart could well describe the situation in Zimbabwe, though it of course applies to Nigeria - a country whose current plight is brilliantly dissected by Karl Maier in This House Has Fallen . Another wonderful, if grisly book, Ludo de Witte's The Assassination of Lumumba - a genuinely revealing work - comes next. On a happier note, Rosamund Grant's Essential African Cookbook supplies recipes for groundnut chicken, lobster piri-piri and Nigerian Meat Stew. The latter is delicious, despite its blunt name.
