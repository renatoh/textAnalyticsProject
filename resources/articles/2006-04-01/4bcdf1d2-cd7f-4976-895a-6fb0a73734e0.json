The cabinet Clement Attlee chose in 1945 - Bevin, Bevan, Cripps, Dalton, Morrison - can be called many things but \"dullards\" is not one of them. A more talented cabinet has never been appointed. Far from having \"lost the plot\" in 1947, it set up the NHS in 1948 and went on to establish the Attlee consensus. Moreover, calling John Major's premiership \"pointless\" is easy. Historians are more likely to credit him with putting Ireland top of his agenda, despite his dependence on Ulster Unionist votes. Finally, Gladstone didn't wreck the Liberal party.
