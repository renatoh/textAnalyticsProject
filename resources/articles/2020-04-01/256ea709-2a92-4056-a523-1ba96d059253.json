Asked on Friday whether the government had given approval to the NRL to resume on 28 May Berejiklian told the ABC the \u201cshort answer is no\u201d. The premier said it would be up to the NRL to show health authorities it could resume safely. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me whether the NSW government has formally given approval, the short answer is no,\u201d she said. \u201cThe organisation has to show that they\u2019re compliant to the health rules and if they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t proceed. If they do well, good luck to them or any other organisation.\u201d But V\u2019landys, also speaking on the ABC, insisted the league already has approval to resume \u201cfrom the necessary departments\u201d. \u201cWe do have to show our plans and our actions. I\u2019ve got to say from the outset this is six weeks away, it\u2019s not tomorrow or next week. There\u2019s six weeks of more data and more looking at the health measures we will put in place [before resuming],\u201d he said. The league has pushed ahead with its plan to begin holding matches by the end of May, despite criticism from the Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and Australia\u2019s chief medical officer. Last week the NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller, who has been placed in charge of the state\u2019s response to Covid-19, wrote to V\u2019landys, saying there was no legal obstacle for the NRL\u2019s plans to resume playing, despite strict public health orders. It appears V\u2019landys is relying on that advice, which is based on earlier exemptions in the state\u2019s public health orders introduced before tighter controls on broader public movement which allow professional sport to continue. The league would still have to show, however, that it could demonstrate it could resume safely. Asked what agencies had granted approvals for the game to resume, V\u2019landys said the public health orders \u201cdoesn\u2019t preclude us from playing the game as long as we can show the government we have the appropriate biosecurity measures in place and there\u2019s no health risk to any of the players\u201d. \u201cAnd we will show that and we will do it. At the moment we could play tomorrow if we could show that we\u2019ve got those measures in place,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the health order it precludes sport from the social distancing measures and allows us to play.\u201d He said the NRL would introduce \u201cstrict biosecurity measures\u201d at venues, and conduct temperature checks on players three times a day. \u201cThe proof is in the pudding at the moment, not one player has proven positive to the virus so all of our players have been following our self isolation rules and [are] not interacting with the community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six weeks as I say to see how the infection rate is going, if the infection rate spikes well naturally we will re-target another date.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
