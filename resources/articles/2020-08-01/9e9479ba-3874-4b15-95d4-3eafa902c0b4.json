First, there\u2019s the deep breath in to contemplate the appalling vista. Then the decluttering starts \u2013 evidence taken out, dusted down and examined piece by piece to determine whether it is valuable or not, then binned or replaced as necessary. Then the room itself is cleaned and swept for details, with Engle mopping the floor as she backs out of a place now fit for purpose. What an appalling vista she had to contemplate in The Unbelievable Story of Carl Beech (BBC Two). Through footage from police interviews, contemporary media reports, Beech\u2019s own blog posts at the time and interviews then and now with those involved, Engle\u2019s latest documentary laid bare the phenomenon of the man who sparked a \u00a32m police investigation. Beech\u2019s allegations of childhood abuse in the 1970s and 80s by a paedophile ring comprising high-ranking members of the establishment was of course later unravelled as a hoax, apparently designed to secure him what eventually amounted to \u00a322,000 in criminal injuries compensation. Wittingly or unwittingly, the hospital inspector and former NHS paediatric nurse seemed to have chosen his moment well. He made his claims of terrible abuse at the hands of named and nameless individuals \u2013 among the former were Sir Leon Brittan, Lord Bramall, Harvey Proctor and Sir Edward Heath \u2013 in 2014. They fell on credulous ground, in the wake of the 2012 Jimmy Savile scandal, which had proved beyond all doubt that extraordinarily evil behaviour by prominent people could go unchallenged and either ignored or actively covered up for years. After Beech conducted an interview with the news site Exaro, the Metropolitan police got in touch and launched Operation Midland to investigate his claims, quickly announcing that they felt they were \u201ctrue\u201d. The Labour MP Tom Watson lent his support to Beech, who added knowledge of three murders and an additional witness, \u201cFred\u201d, to his claims. In the media, the whole thing \u2013 as sex, abuse and conspiracy-based cases speaking to our worst fears tend to do \u2013 took on a febrile life of its own. What was lost in the rush to believe \u2013 or to be seen to believe, and to overcompensate for former failures \u2013 was, well, everything else. As Sir Richard Henriques, the author of a damning report on the case, put it: \u201cThere is no doubt that in the early stages of the investigation, police officers proceeded on the basis that everything they had been told \u2013 remarkable as it was, and highly improbable in my opinion as it seemed from the outset \u2013 was the truth.\u201d Or, as Beech\u2019s ex-wife Dawn \u2013 the effortless breakout star of the documentary \u2013 put it to Engle, as she recalled her first exposure to her then husband\u2019s claims: \u201cI thought, What? What? Really? Really?! Really? Come on. You just think \u2013 what the actual fuck is that about?\u201d Eventually the police and the media all became a little more \u201cDawn\u201d in their thinking. Beech\u2019s allegations fell apart once the slightest scrutiny was brought to bear on him. It was more than a year into their investigation that the Met looked for the first time at Beech\u2019s own computer, full medical records (to substantiate his extensive alleged injuries) and mobile phone. \u201cThese are all matters,\u201d notes Sir Richard, \u201cthat would have brought this investigation to a crashing halt within hours.\u201d Dawn\u2019s take would no doubt have been shorter. What they found there led to Beech\u2019s conviction and an 18-year sentence for child sex offences, fraud and perverting the course of justice. Small comfort to the men accused. Brittan died during the investigation, as did Lord Bramall\u2019s wife, and Proctor lost his job and home. The film did leave a corner or two still cobwebbed. Watson\u2019s support was noted in passing but not the extent, which included an inflammatory article after Brittan\u2019s death about the politician\u2019s investigation by Operation Midland. And the BBC\u2019s sceptical edition of Panorama that did much to air and fuel the growing doubts round the case was mentioned, but not its earlier edition of Newsnight that had done quite as much as anything else to fan the flames of suspicion round Brittan et al. Nevertheless, like so many of Engle\u2019s previous films \u2013 The Cult Next Door or, most recently, The $50 Million Art Swindle \u2013 it succeeded in laying bare the human frailties we try to guard against individually, but which, when they infest an collective endeavour or an institution, bring about disproportionate destruction and harm. But on we go, clearing one room at a time, as best we can."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
