The English champions have submitted a report to the Rugby Football Union on Cockerill's alleged criticisms of the referee, Chris White, during the 15-6 win against Bath and Twickenham's disciplinary team is considering Leicester's version of events. But the former England hooker is not expected to suffer the fate of Brendan Venter, the Saracens director of rugby who is banned from entering Twickenham for the Premiership final this Saturday for his behaviour at Welford Road during a league win against Leicester this month. \"If the union deem my behaviour to be sufficient to charge me, that's up to them. As far as I am aware, that's not the case. We will just get on with life,\" said Cockerill. \"As far as I am aware, there is not a case to answer. Is thumping the table and kicking the front of the stand unacceptable behaviour? Maybe it is, I don't do it on purpose. I do it because I react to something on the field. I didn't use foul language which I was charged with before and I did not this time. \"I should have acted in a more controlled way but sometimes the game is not quite like that. If you have passion for the game and passion for winning, sometimes you have to shout at whatever it may be. Sometimes I'm shouting at a player or players rather than the referee or a decision or anything else. That's the game. I did not use foul or abusive language and I did not touch anybody. I was venting my frustration at lots of things. Some of them were my own frustrations. They just said to be careful about my conduct, which is fair enough.\" Meanwhile the Leicester flanker Craig Newby could miss the Premiership final after being cited for a dangerous tackle in the Bath game. The New Zealander will appear before an RFU disciplinary hearing panel in London today after being reported for his tackle on Bath's fly-half Butch James. The England flanker Tom Rees has agreed a two-year contract extension that will keep him at Wasps until 2013. The 25-year-old club captain made his 100th appearance for Wasps this season after returning from two shoulder operations and last week he pulled out of this summer's Saxons squad to continue to recuperate from the injury. \"Tom is a player who embodies what Wasps is about,\" said the director of rugby, Tony Hanks. Leeds have further strengthened their squad with the signing of the former Bristol lock Sean Hohneck from the Italian club Viadana on a two-year contract. The 31-year-old Kiwi will replace the Biarritz-bound Erik Lund."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
