Glenn Whelan's injury-time strike for 2\u20132 denied Villa the chance to move eight points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal and prompted O'Neill to question whether his side belonged in the same company as the established top four. \"We are more than disappointed in the dressing room, pretty devastated,\" reflected the Villa manager, whose side had doubled their lead with 11 minutes remaining when John Carew converted a spectacular volley. \"We were in total control of the game. We're two-nil up with four or five minutes to go. If we don't see the first goal out we should be able to see the second one through. It didn't materialise and we have dropped two points.\" O'Neill described Villa's performance in the first half as \"brilliant\" but admitted his side had lost their way in the second half when he detected, for the first time since he took over at the club, \"a degree of over-confidence\". The Villa manager felt that Stoke duly \"took heart\" although he was unable to explain how Tony Pulis's side, who remain in the relegation zone on goal difference, were able to rescue a point. \"You know what the opposition are going to do,\" said O'Neill, who must pick up the pieces in time for Villa's trip to Manchester City on Wednesday. \"They're going to put it in and you have to deal with it. The truth is, we didn't do that well enough. It's pretty galling because, for the most part, we were excellent. But at 2-0 we should see it through. I think top-four sides would see it through. I couldn't be more disappointed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
