The latter were making their way to a mass of hangar-sized superstores and \"strip malls\". Watching the crowds, I recalled a recent Daily Telegraph leader, its mention of \"the north-south divide that is fast turning Britain into the western equivalent of the Ukraine\" and the claim that \"a visitor from outer space would assume that voters on either side of it belonged to a different religious or ethnic group\". Yet there was nothing stereotypically northern about this scene - families dressed in branded casualwear, the odd 4x4, bank holiday weekend being celebrated by buying stuff. I could have been anywhere. And yet, two days before, a third of the 96 seats on Manchester city council had been up for election, and as in Liverpool and Newcastle, the Tories had once again failed to take a single one. By way of news management they pointed to a smattering of northern successes, but could not shake off the fact that only a fraction of their English gains came from anywhere above the Midlands. In the Scottish constituency elections, they flatlined; in the list vote, their 2003 figure dropped. In Wales, the Tory vote increased by only a couple of points. That story, of course, was mirrored by the wipeout of Labour south of the fabled line from the Severn to the Wash, and a blue expanse in which nervous MPs will now defend the electoral ramparts without councillors to help them. Two questions, then. Despite all those years of New Labour's ideological gymnastics, underneath the various dualities of 21st century politics - Labour v Tories, Tories v Lib Dems, Lib Dems v Labour, Labour v SNP - are we not tumbling back to a fundamental division between an individualist, Thatcherite south (except London) and a collectivist \"north\" that includes Scotland and Wales? And if so, what happens in the event of a Tory triumph in 2009? Devolution would lessen the pain for Scotland and Wales - though past skirmishes between Alex Salmond and Gordon Brown would surely fade into insignificance once the former used a Cameron government to really stoke support for separatism. As for England, those of us with scars from the 1980s will remember the last time a Conservative yoke extended to places that wanted no part of it. Northern cities - Manchester, Sheffield and the deranged experiment in municipal Trotskyism that was Militant Liverpool - became self-styled centres of resistance. On a school trip to Westminster, I can recall hearing one Labour politician telling us that the Thatcher government \"had no right to rule Manchester\". That thinking duly bled out into the culture, updating the centuries-old idea that the parasitic south always lords it over the righteous north. One of the biggest-selling T-shirts in late 80s Manchester read, \"Born in the North, Return to the North, Exist in the North, Die in the North\". There was a certain embattled glory to it all, there in everything from the music of The Smiths to the social-realist soap of Brookside. A line, I suppose, can be drawn from today's miracles of urban regeneration to the 1980s' belligerent sense of civic pride. But coming home, I was always struck by an atmosphere of parochialism. Well-travelled twentysomethings sounded more like throwbacks to the pre-railway age. Moving south was a matter of betrayal; anything northern usually got the benefit of the doubt. Once the Euston train had pulled out of Crewe, everything became clear - these were glaring signs of a country turned dysfunctional. We now live in more prosperous, less rancorous times. Cameron, some will argue, is too cuddly and consensual to foment anything similar; and anyway, the post-Blair Labour party would hardly tolerate town hall firebrands enacting fantasies of red resistance. All that may be true, but come a Tory victory we should keep an eye on the economy and also pay close attention to their plans for the public sector - and how they might sit in those parts of the country where the fate of the welfare is state still at the heart of politics. And what about the cultural factors that will inflame political hostilities? As Peter Hitchens discovered in his recent Cameron-bashing Dispatches programme for Channel 4, the legendary Tory \"A\" list is known by insiders as the \"K &amp; C\" list, as in Kensington and Chelsea. With the Tories' northern vacuum meaning that precious few non-southern voices will make it to the front bench (and Liam Fox and the mega-earning William Hague rumoured to be set for demotion), how would applied Cameronism play in Barnsley and Bridgend, Gateshead and Glenrothes? Plenty of Tory voters, of course, may well fear Gordon Brown hanging on by his fingertips and squashing the collective will of the south with the aid of his own inflammatory accent - although at the risk of making light of Tory pain, they would surely have a lot less to squeal about. In either case, the comparisons with the livelier parts of the old eastern bloc can be put to one side. Come the decisive return of the UK's big schism, there will be no week-long protests or poison plots, just a reversion to that most British of conditions: suppressed tension, festering into the future. john.harris@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
