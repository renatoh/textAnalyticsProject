It\u2019d be lovely.\u201d Sat: Job done, with five minutes to spare. STRIKE OF THE DAY Adam Smith started Bournemouth\u2019s fightback with a curvaceous 20-yarder. It wasn\u2019t so much spinning as swinging wildly as it sped towards the top corner. DON\u2019T STOP BELIEVING Two days over four years after his last league game, and one day under nine years since he was last seen in the top flight, Richard Wright, 38, made the bench for Manchester City. He\u2019s now been in three of the 125 Premier League matchday squads they\u2019ve named since signing him. TEAM TALK OF THE DAY Steve McClaren: looking for a big second-half response after rousing his Newcastle side, who were 3-1 down at the break. He hadn\u2019t even made it back to the dugout before Yannick Bolasie scored Palace\u2019s fourth. GIVE UP NOW DEPT Bayern Munich\u2019s Thomas M\u00fcller scored 13 league goals in 2012-13, 13 league goals in 2013-14 and 13 league goals in 2014-15. Yesterday against Hertha Berlin he scored his 13th league goal of 2015-16 \u2013 time for a long holiday? MOST REGRETS Everton fans spilled on to the pitch to celebrate an apparent stoppage-time winner from Ross Barkley, with just 15 seconds to play. By the time they were cleared they\u2019d created enough bonus stoppage-time for Bournemouth to equalise.
