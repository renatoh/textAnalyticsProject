To clarify: the chain was founded by Peter Boizot, who opened the first Pizza Express restaurants in the 1960s. Osmond and a partner bought the company in 1992 and built it into a national chain (Pizza Express founder among few bidders for Lloyds bank branches, 28 July, page 26). \u2022\u2008A report on the Man Booker longlist noted that it included novels which had failed to make it on to the radar of newspaper literary editors and said one, Yvvette Edwards's A Cupboard Full of Coats, was not reviewed by any national paper. In fact, the book did receive a short review in the Daily Mail (He used to work in a warehouse. Now he is pitted against Barnes for the Booker, 27 July, page 3). \u2022\u2008The large pair of gold lam\u00e9 knickers on show at the newly opened Museum of Liverpool belonged to the poet and artist Adrian Henri, rather than to Adrian George, as our article said (Ready to open: Museum on the Mersey, 18 July, page 15). \u2022\u2008Near homophone corner: \"If you want to revel in the dappled shade of the most beautiful canap\u00e9 of plane trees in Europe, go now.\" (French to say au revoir to canalside trees, 28 July, page 3, G2)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
