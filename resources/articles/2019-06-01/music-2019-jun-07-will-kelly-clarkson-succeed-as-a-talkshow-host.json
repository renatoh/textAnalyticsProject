Which is amazing: she is literally the pop star we would all like to have a long chat on the sofa with. Kelly, who is also a coach on The Voice US, described filming the series as \u201creally fun\u201d, adding: \u201cI just love communication, and I think there\u2019s a lot of brokenness with that in the world right now; there\u2019s just so much division. I want my show to be really inclusive.\u201d No UK broadcaster has picked it up as yet, but it launches in September in the US and it will air \u201cright before Ellen [DeGeneres\u2019s chatshow]\u201d according to Kelly. No pressure, then. But musicians don\u2019t exactly have a great track record when it comes to hosting chatshows. The format has a habit of going off the rails when put in the hands of singers. In 2006, Channel 4 decided that \u201cbeing a bit mouthy in interviews\u201d meant Charlotte Church needed her own chatshow called \u2026 The Charlotte Church Show. Clearly, someone had told her to be as outrageous as she could, because she slapped Johnny Vegas live on air, kicked off a chat with an uneasy Hilary Duff by showing her a picture of Paris and Nicky Hilton, asking what she thought of \u201cthose fame-hungry tarts\u201d, and cackled about Peter Andre\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d penis with Katie Price. She quit after three series. Weirdly, that didn\u2019t put TV bosses off signing up more pop stars for chatshows. Remember the slow-motion car crash that was BBC Three\u2019s Lily Allen and Friends? Cancelled after one series, the format was weird (the audience was made up of Lily\u2019s MySpace friends, because 2008) and Lily struggled to show even a flicker of interest in her guests, including one week, the confusing combination of Cuba Gooding Jr and David Mitchell. Lily\u2019s natural speaking voice is quite monotone and she was tasked with awkwardly worded questions such as: \u201cIn your new film you get off with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz \u2013 was she a good kisser?\u201d to the likes of Martin Freeman while lying on a bed. According to one report in the Sun, she \u201cpulled her boob out and played with it for three minutes\u201d while interviewing Paddy McGuinness. At the end of the day, Kelly\u2019s success or failure will all come down to one thing: is she interested in her guests? It might sound obvious, but good celebs-turned-chatshow-hosts actually care about the answers to their questions (see: Chelsea Handler) and the bad ones fail because they don\u2019t (see: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian struggling to find common ground with any guest she\u2019s not directly related to on her short-lived show Kocktails With Khlo\u00e9). Kelly is incredibly watchable on The Voice, but will she be able to translate that warmness and curiosity to a talkshow format? Don\u2019t worry, Kelly: if it all goes wrong, at least you won\u2019t have attacked a guest or got your boob out on TV."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
