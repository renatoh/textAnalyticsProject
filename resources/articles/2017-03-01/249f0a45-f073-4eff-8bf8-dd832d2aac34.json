Dominic Grieve was one of a group of Tory backbenchers who spoke out against the bill, but their mini-rebellion was not enough to prevent the Commons from throwing out amendments to the Brexit bill that had been previously passed by the Lords. Peers later conceded the supremacy of the House of Commons by accepting the legislation without any amendments after a short debate. Grieve spoke the most forcefully against the government\u2019s decision to hold out against promising a vote on the outcome of the Brexit talks, whether there is a deal or no deal. \u201cThere is a clear way of doing things, and if we follow them we will come up with the right decisions at each point,\u201d Grieve said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to mire ourselves in chaos. So very reluctantly, because I want to support the government, I have to say if we persist with this I\u2019m going most reluctantly to have to say on that second amendment I can\u2019t support the government this evening.\u201d A number of Conservative MPs around him nodded in approval, as Grieve announced he was refusing to support the government\u2019s motion to overturn the House of Lords amendment. But despite his speech, Grieve ended up only abstaining on the motion, along with a few other would-be Tory rebels fighting a hard Brexit: Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan, Ben Howlett, Neil Carmichael, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach and Andrew Tyrie. MPs voted by 331 to 286 to overturn the House of Lords amendment that would have guaranteed parliament another say after two years of Theresa May\u2019s negotiations and by 335 votes to 287 against protecting the rights of EU citizens in the UK. No Conservatives went so far as to vote against the government on that issue, although Tania Mathias and Alex Chalk, two Conservatives who won their seats from Lib Dems, rebelled on the issue of guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals in the UK. During the debate, a number of opposition MPs had urged Tory MPs to be brave in opposing their government. Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, called on them to consider they would be giving May an \u201cunfettered power to negotiate in whatever way she likes\u201d. \u201cWhat we shouldn\u2019t be doing is putting power entirely in the hands of one person, in the prime minister, without any insurance policy whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is something we shouldn\u2019t be frightened of, we shouldn\u2019t be shy of it, we should welcome it, it is a strength and part of the process. \u201cThey say take back control, and yet at the same time they are asking us to muzzle parliament for the next two-year period.\u201d Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader, whose wife is Spanish and mother is Dutch, also urged Tories to defy the whip, saying: \u201cFor me, the political is personal. My mother has lived here for more than 50 years, raised four children, paid her taxes; my wife raised children, paid taxes, works as a lawyer. \u201cIt beggars belief that people like them and millions like them have had a question mark placed over their status, their peace of mind, their wellbeing in our great country, because of the action or the shameless inaction of this government. We picked the fight, not the EU.\u201d However, Tory MPs appeared to have been reassured by private promises that the government would aim for a Brexit deal and aim to avoid falling back on World Trade Organisation tariffs at all costs. Several told the Guardian that ministers were open to the idea of letting MPs have a proper vote at the end of two years, but No 10 was insistent that there should not be a specific reference to it on the face of the bill. At the dispatch box, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, told colleagues that MPs and peers had made their arguments with \u201cpassion, sincerity and conviction\u201d, but he was disappointed by the amendments. He insisted he was interested in the rights of millions of citizens, bringing together Europeans in the UK and Britons living on the continent, adding that he would take personal \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d for their future guarantees. He argued that European citizens made a vital contribution to society and that he wanted them to retain all their rights. \u201cThe government has been very clear of what it intends \u2013 it intends to guarantee the rights of both British and European citizens,\u201d he said. But he added that he needed the same commitment from other countries and that they would not embark on talks before article 50 is triggered. He said that was why it was so important to pass this bill quickly. \u201cEvery member state has reinforced the point: they want this at the top of the agenda, they want this to be dealt with first,\u201d he said, and promised a quick deal. On the second vote, Davis said guaranteeing such a vote could hamper the government during its negotiations. He questioned the motives of those arguing for it, claiming that they wanted to reverse the referendum result. He said: \u201cAs we embark on the forthcoming negotiations, our guiding approach is simple: we will not do anything that will undermine the national interest, including interests of British citizens living in the EU.\u201d \u201cAnd we will not enter the negotiations with our hands tied,\u201d he said, suggesting the EU would be incentivised to offer a bad deal to the UK if it knew that it could be rejected by parliament. The Labour frontbench tried to get the government to accept the House of Lords amendment. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, asked what the problem was with regards to EU citizens, pointing out that the amendment gave the government three months after article 50 was triggered to find a solution. \u201cAre we prepared to use one set of people, those who are here, as a bargaining chip to get the right settlement for people?\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole argument about reciprocal rights is about bargaining.\u201d He also rejected Davis\u2019s suggestion that what he said at the dispatch box in parliament was binding: \u201cThat is not a legal commitment, and secretaries of state can change and governments can change. That is why we need a commitment.\u201d However, Labour said it would not press the point further in the House of Lords, given that there was no hope of getting the government to change its position. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, said the party would let the Brexit bill pass unamended as a result of May\u2019s refusal to make any concessions on the face of the legislation. \u201cIf the House of Lords was to vote to send the amendments back, I wouldn\u2019t expect a different result, so it is highly unlikely we can get the House of Commons to change its mind,\u201d she said. \u201cOn that basis, we could play politics, but we\u2019ve set a really high bar on the principle, with a majority of 102 and 98 \u2026 If I thought there was a foot in the door or a glimmer of hope that we could change this bill, I would fight it tooth and nail, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u201d There were angry clashes between Labour\u2019s Brexit spokeswoman, Lady Hayter, and Lib Dem peers as she outlined her party\u2019s position and was met with jeers. She replied: \u201cI\u2019ll take no lessons from the Liberal Democrats, who confessed to me outside the chamber that this is appealing to their core vote and they\u2019re piling on members because of it.\u201d Viscount Hailsham, one of the few Conservatives who voted in favour of the amendment last time, agreed that it was wrong to fight on. \u201cWe have asked the Commons to think again, they have thought again, they have not taken our advice, and our role now I believe is not to insist,\u201d he said. However, the Lib Dem Lord Taverne said that peers were entitled to refuse to back down on the issue of a final vote because MPs had abandoned their commitment to representative democracy. They were now acting as delegates, not representatives, because they are giving primacy to the views of the people as expressed in the referendum. He said the argument that the \u201cwill of the people\u201d took precedence was one that had been used by dictators like Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin, and called it a threat to \u201cthe essence of democracy\u201d. The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said Labour had been given a chance to block \u201chard Brexit\u201d but had chosen not to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
