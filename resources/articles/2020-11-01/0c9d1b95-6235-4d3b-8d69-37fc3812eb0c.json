The addition of the public broadcasters is one of the significant changes treasurer Josh Frydenberg has made to the draft mandatory news code before it is tabled in parliament by 10 December. Labor, the Greens and several crossbenchers suggested the ABC and SBS should be added to the ranks of Australian news publishers to benefit from the code, in the interests of helping gain broad cross-party support for the legislation. When he announced the draft code, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, said the ABC and SBS were excluded because they were taxpayer-funded. If passed, the legislation would force Google and Facebook to share revenue from news links with Nine Entertainment, News Corp, and any other eligible media companies including Guardian Australia, or pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. As Frydenberg puts the final touches on the legislation, one of the architects of the modern internet, Dr Vinton G Cerf, accused the Morrison government of trying to \u201cturn back time\u201d. Cerf, the vice-president and chief internet evangelist at Google, says the draft code will \u201cdistort the open internet\u201d and is like forcing Australians to go back to the Yellow Pages and encyclopedia Britannica for information. The code \u201cis an intervention that would distort access to information and disadvantage Australians\u201d Cerf wrote, in the latest of a long series of arguments from Google against the code. It would also \u201cintroduce bias into systems that were designed to be fair, and undercut a democratic internet where people compete not on their political influence, but on the value of their content\u201d, he added. The chair of the Public Interest Journalism Initiative, Allan Fels, a former chair of the ACCC, said that far from turning back time, the code would force the digital platforms to turn their clocks forward and \u201ccatch-up at long last with what is clearly in the public interest\u201d. \u201cGoogle obviously has a commercial interest in this code not going ahead, but the reason the code is needed is because there is an established market imbalance and distortion of market power, and that is why the government referred the matter to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission,\u201d Fels told Guardian Australia. Piji and the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas both say the code should include the ABC and SBS, but the revenue should go to fund public interest journalism. While Google has engaged publicly with the debate, with regular blogposts and videos, Facebook has maintained a public silence since announcing on 1 September it would block Australians from sharing news, but is understood to be in confidential negotiations with the government. One of the concessions Facebook was trying to get from the government was to take Instagram, which it owns, out of the code. But media companies want the full suite of products offered by Google and Facebook covered. The vice-president of Google Australia Mel Silva insists the search engine giant has supported the local news industry in multiple ways and denies the company makes money from links to news content. \u201cHow the final code is designed and enforced matters to millions of Australians who rely on digital tools like Google Search, and may well have broader, global ramifications \u2013 so this is a critical stage,\u201d Silva said. \u201cOver the past few months, we\u2019ve made it clear that while we have serious concerns about the way the draft legislation is framed, we\u2019re committed to working with the government and the ACCC to get to a version of the code that\u2019s workable and fair for platforms, publishers and all Australians.\u201d In a rare joint open letter, Nine, News Corp, Seven West Media, Guardian Australia, and the commercial television and radio broadcasters asked the government to ensure four essential elements, including final offer arbitration, remain central to the code. Google has been lobbying for the \u201cextreme and unusual\u201d final offer arbitration to be replaced by standard arbitration, saying the suggested form leaves news businesses free to make extreme claims \u201cwithout digital platforms being able to respond effectively, making an unfair outcome inevitable\u201d. The draft code was written by the ACCC and after feedback from the industry and intensive lobbying from the digital platforms was handed to Frydenberg for a final drafting. Everyone involved in negotiations has had to sign a non-disclosure agreement. \u201cThe news media and digital platforms bargaining code will address bargaining power imbalances between digital platforms and media companies following an 18-month review into digital platforms by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cThe government has conducted a further targeted round of consultation with key stakeholders and will carefully assess the feedback we have received before finalising legislation to give effect to the code by the end of the year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
