You can tell by all the craters. Then there are the angry cauldrons that, every so often and without warning, boil over and spew out scalding hot steam into the icy air. It's positively hormonal. 'Ah yes, we are a young country,' agrees our Super Jeep driver Edward, thrusting the giant, bouncy hulk of a vehicle up the side of a snow-clad mountain on two wheels, as if to prove the point. Evidence of Iceland's tormented youth is everywhere: from the black, knobbly lava fields that cover 10 per cent of the country to the highlands of the North, where glaciers gouged and carved their way through the landscape during the Ice Age, leaving jagged mountains in their wake. It feels like the surface of the Moon - so much so, in fact, that Nasa sends its trainee astronaunts there to get a feel for the lunar terrain. All this volcanic activity has a very welcome side effect: geothermal springs. And where there is a geothermal spring, you can bet there's an outdoor swimming pool and a hot tub. It's where Icelanders come to relax, where shop assistants literally rub shoulders with government Ministers - and where I was going to test the therapeutic waters of the world's northernmost capital. This was billed as a stress-busting trip, and after a weekend up and down ladders, drilling holes and collecting bruises, it was timely. I must admit that I find relaxation something of a strain - especially when it's enforced. But then my spa experience to date had been confined to urban retreats where women float around wearing St Tropez tans and smug smiles against the backdrop of peeling trompe l'oeil 'Tuscan' landscapes straight out of a 1970s porn film, only to be thrown out later, wrinkled and gasping for a full-throttle cappuccino, purse considerably lighter after all those insipid herbal teas, into the night, where the streets seem dirtier, the air more polluted and the people uglier than before. Of course no trompe l'oeil artist could ever have come up with the surreal setting of the Blue Lagoon. It is a strange and ethereal place. Surrounded by snow-covered lava fields, the steaming pool of milky blue water, famous for its healing powers, is Iceland's most visited site - and with good reason. This by-product of the neighbouring Svartsengi power station, a slightly alarming vision of hot metal and belching steam on the flat horizon, contains a cocktail of naturally occurring minerals and blue-green algae that relaxes and stimulates body and soul. With the green glow of the northern lights overhead and the crisp air wafting round your ears, you can feel the stress ebbing away, leaving behind a profound sense of wellbeing that remains long after you've rinsed the last, stubborn lump of silica mud from your hair. But all that wallowing doesn't half stoke up an appetite. Fortunately, the Blue Lagoon's top-class restaurant does a mean shark steak and its proximity to the fishing village of Grindavik means fresh seafood is always on the menu. After fishing, tourism is Iceland's biggest earner, but with a population of fewer than 300,000 (about the same as Hull) in an area the size of Ireland, there's plenty of room to go round. Throughout the summer, despite some of the highest prices in Europe, tourists are drawn by the spectacular landscape, walking and trekking opportunites and the chance to see puffins and whales. In the colder months, the Gulf Stream takes the edge off the icy air, but freezing conditions and short days keep the visitors away and even well-trodden paths like the 'Golden Circle' - including ancient Pingvellir, the magnificent two-tiered waterfall at Gullfoss and the spouting geothermal springs of Geysir - are relatively free from marauding tour groups. Arriving off-season at the beginning of winter, we had Pingvellir almost to ourselves. The historic seat of Iceland's government, the city was established in 930AD by Viking settlers, some of whose laws - including the rights to driftwood - are still in force today. Not much remains of the parliament buildings, but the plains around Pingvellir - a kind of geological no man's land - lie directly on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the meeting point of the American and Eurasian continental plates, which each year drift apart by about 1cm, creating gaping fissures and spurting lava flows from deep beneath the Earth's crust. This is where the majority of Iceland's seismic action takes place, with volcanic eruptions happening every three to five years and frequent earthquakes. It's like a geography book that's come to life. The old turf cottages of the past have largely been replaced by concrete houses built to withstand the mighty forces of nature - if not to win any architecture prizes. The outskirts of Reykjavik are marred by unappealing factory buildings and shopping malls, but so popular is the countryside with Reykjavik's upwardly mobile that prefabricated wooden holiday homes (like Russian dachas) are popping up all over the hills, some arriving on the back of a lorry, so complete that there's practically a cat on the doorstep. After an off-piste Super Jeep safari around the Golden Circle, a dip in one of Reykjavik's outdoor public pools is a good way to unwind - if you can brave the teeth-chattering walk from heated changing room to hot tub. And with the entrance fee considerably less than the price of a beer, you can see why they're popular places to meet friends. Life expectancy is high in Iceland, and I am encouraged to prolong mine by plunging into a series of hot tubs, each progressively hotter than the next, until my body is an unattractive mottled purple. Then it's back into the pool for an invigorating swim before heading back to the hotel, where it seems appropriate to drift off, while reading a novel by Halldor Laxness, into the best night's sleep I've had in months.
