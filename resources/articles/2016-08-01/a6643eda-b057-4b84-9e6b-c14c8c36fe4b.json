Today, despite working out of modest premises with just two tiny pot stills in the hills of Chichibu, a town 100 km northwest of Tokyo, Akuto\u2019s single malts are winning rave reviews from the global whisky cognoscenti. Many are willing to pay hundreds of dollars - and in a few cases much more - for a bottle of single malt from what is Japan\u2019s smallest distillery. The Whisky Magazine, a British publication, has consistently given awards to Akuto\u2019s firm, Venture Whisky, and its range of \u201cIchiro\u2019s\u201d single malts now rival those from the bigger and more established Japanese distillers Suntory and Nikka. This year, Akuto won first prize in the Japanese single malt single class category at the World Whiskies Awards. The 50-year-old traces Japan\u2019s newfound obsession with whisky to its long history of brewing sake. \u201cWe love perfecting the art of making things, so you could say we\u2019re quite geeky in that respect,\u201d he says. \u201cThat determination to do things right extends to whisky.\u201d The comparison is particularly apposite in Akuto\u2019s case. His grandfather, a sake maker, was running the family\u2019s 300-year-old sake brewery when, on a whim, he decided to obtain a distiller\u2019s license a year after the second world war ended. Akuto\u2019s father continued to dabble in whisky making, using two stills imported from Scotland to produce about 400 casks. By 2000, however, the end of Japan\u2019s bubble economy and a decline in sake consumption forced the family to sell up. The sale, though, turned out to be the beginning of Ichiro Akuto\u2019s successful career as a distiller, after he snapped up the unwanted stills and casks of maturing whisky from the brewery\u2019s new owners. He launched Venture Whisky in 2008 and produced his first label \u2013 Ichiro\u2019s Vintage Single Malt 1988 \u2013 the following year. Much of the rest of the inherited stock went into Venture\u2019s award-winning \u201ccard\u201d series, with each small batch labelled with the name of a playing card. The whiskies sold out as soon as they went on sale, bought, in some cases, for tens of thousands of yen online by whisky enthusiasts. Some bottles in the series are now considered collector\u2019s items. Akuto achieved another milestone last year when a bottle of his 1960 Karuizawa single malt \u2013 made with whisky rescued from the family sake brewery - sold for a US$118,500 at an auction in Hong Kong, a record for a Japanese whisky. The bottle sold at Bonhams was one of its kind just 41 in existence, but it is the whiskies - which cost anything from a few thousand yen to 100,000 yen or more - made exclusively at the Chichibu distillery that are reinforcing Japan\u2019s unlikely status as a whisky superpower. Most of the distillery\u2019s barley comes from Norfolk, with smaller quantities from Germany and Scotland, whose peaty tones initially struggled to win over Japanese drinkers more accustomed to lighter, floral flavours. Akuto is also experimenting with barley grown locally, a bold move that, if successful, promises to produce a genuinely Japanese whisky. The company produced 90,000 bottles of whisky last year, about half of which were for the international market, with the UK, France and Taiwan among its biggest customers. It has also started exporting to the US. \u201cIf we were interested in just making balanced, easy-to-drink whiskies then we would inevitably have to compete with Suntory and Nikka,\u201d says Yumi Yoshikawa, Venture\u2019s brand ambassador. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to do the opposite \u2013 making whiskies with character that are not necessarily balanced or easy to drink. That\u2019s how we\u2019re keeping our market share,\u201d adds Yoshikawa, whose love of the \u201cwater of life\u201d has taken her on study tours to 70 distilleries around the world over the past five years. Venture\u2019s older single malts of the future are maturing in 4,000 casks that once contained sherry from Spain and Portugal, wine from France and bourbon from the US. At the firm\u2019s in-house cooperage, lengths of Japanese oak are being turned into wholly domestic casks that will impart new flavours to its whiskies. Chichibu\u2019s hot, humid summers and cold winters are ideally suited to whisky production, with the temperature variation exacerbated by the town\u2019s mountainous location. \u201cThat all makes for deep whisky maturation,\u201d Akuto says. The number of international awards going to Japanese whiskies underlines the dramatic progress the country\u2019s distillers have made since Masataka Taketsuru launched Suntory\u2019s Yamazaki distillery in 1923. As recently as the 1990s, whisky \u2013 usually the blended variety \u2013 was often drunk as highballs or watered down, mizuwari-style, in salaryman bars. Chichibu, though, is the closest Japan comes to a genuinely craft distillery, with a staff of 14 whose average age is just 30. \u201cWe\u2019re not competing with the big companies,\u201d says Akuto, who likens his enterprise to a lean sumo wrestler who, lacking the heft to bulldoze his opponents, must rely on faultless technique and a sense of adventure. \u201cYou could say that we\u2019re building our own, more exclusive sumo ring and keeping out the bigger guys out that way,\u201d he adds. He has ambitious plans for his distillery, including a 10 percent annual increase in sales and expanded premises. But he has no intention of selling his idiosyncratic whiskies in supermarkets or convenience stores; instead, their growing number of devotees must go online or buy directly from specialist suppliers, including high-end department stores. \u201cOur whiskies are relatively expensive, and they\u2019re intended to be drunk over time and savoured,\u201d says Akuto, whose next big project is to release a 10-year-old whisky to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, followed by a 30-year-old single malt made entirely in Chichibu. Judging by the reviews his tiny distillery has received so far, they will be worth the wait."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
