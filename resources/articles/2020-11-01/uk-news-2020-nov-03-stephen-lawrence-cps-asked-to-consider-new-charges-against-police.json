The Crown Prosecution Service will be asked to consider if four senior officers in the original murder investigation, all now retired, committed the offence of misconduct in public office. Lawrence, 18, was stabbed to death by a racist gang of at least five white youths on 22 April 1993 in south-east London. It took 19 years for two members of the gang to be convicted of his murder and a public inquiry found a string of errors by police. The decision to refer the case to prosecutors follows a criminal investigation conducted by the National Crime Agency. It began in 2014 into claims Lawrence\u2019s killers were shielded by corruption. But in 2018 it also began examining why officers in charge of the first police investigation into Lawrence\u2019s murder did not make arrests for two weeks after the killing, despite police repeatedly being given the names of suspects. The four former senior officers are Det Supt Ian Crampton, who was in charge for the first three days after the murder; Det Supt Brian Weeden, who took over as senior investigating officer; Det Ch Supt William Ilsley, who oversaw them; and DI Ben Bullock, the deputy senior investigating officer. They were the senior management team in the first Lawrence murder investigation. They have always denied any wrongdoing. The four former Met officers have been interviewed under criminal caution. The fact the case has been referred to the CPS does not mean criminal charges will follow nor that any wrongdoing was committed. The criminal offence of misconduct in public office \u201cis committed when the office holder acts (or fails to act) in a way that constitutes a breach of the duties of that office\u201d, according to guidance from the CPS. The four former officers are being represented by the Police Superintendents\u2019 Association and the Police Federation. In a statement on the men\u2019s behalf, they said:\u201cWe are exceptionally disappointed with this decision. We wish to make clear that the officers have never been interviewed or accused of any corruption. We will continue to provide support to our retired members during this process, who have cooperated fully throughout all the inquiries.\u201d The Lawrence murder suspects were arrested a fortnight after the murder and only after Nelson Mandela met Lawrence\u2019s parents during a trip to London that embarrassed the Met. The public inquiry into how police failed to catch Lawrence\u2019s murderers, chaired by Sir William Macpherson, was critical of all four men in its 1999 report, and of the Metropolitan police in general. Macpherson\u2019s report said: \u201cThere is no doubt but that there were fundamental errors. The investigation was marred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership by senior officers.\u201d Sarah Green, of the police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct, said: \u201cAt the end of an investigation of this type, the IOPC must determine whether there is an indication that any police officer, during the course of their duties, may have committed a criminal offence. \u201cFollowing thorough and careful analysis of the evidence, we have decided there is an indication that four former officers may have committed the offence of misconduct in public office in relation to their actions and omissions prior to the arrests of the five key suspects for Stephen\u2019s murder in 1993. We will be providing a full file of evidence to the CPS over coming days. \u201cIt is important to note that a referral to the CPS does not necessarily mean that criminal charges will follow. It will now be for prosecutors to determine, applying the tests set out in the code for crown prosecutors, whether charges should follow and, if so for whom and what those charges may be.\u201d In a 2018 interview, Crampton defended the decision-making in the first murder investigation, telling the BBC: \u201cI was made aware that there were phone calls coming in, naming people but not saying how they knew. Many of the calls were of a similar nature, as if a rumour\u2019s going round and people are phoning in the rumour they\u2019ve heard. \u201cAt no stage at that point had we got any actual evidence \u2026 information isn\u2019t evidence, there is a distinct difference. \u201cThe strategy was not to arrest \u2013 they were juveniles. You had to handle juveniles very carefully, obviously \u2013 to get them in to simply release them wasn\u2019t really making a lot of sense.\u201d In 2012, two men, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were convicted of the murder. Newspapers claims about corruption led the home secretary, Theresa May, to ordered an inquiry that was conducted by a senior barrister. It recommended a new criminal inquiry into corruption claims, which was carried out by the NCA and supervised by the IOPC, which began in 2015. In 2018, the NCA identified potential issues concerning misconduct in public office around the senior management team of the first Met murder investigation following Stephen\u2019s murder in 1993. The Guardian understands the NCA has not identified evidence that any individual former officer acted corruptly. Green said of the corruption investigation: \u201cThis has been a vast and comprehensive investigation by the NCA, involving the gathering and analysis of several million pages of information and intelligence spanning over 27 years since the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence and the attack on Duwayne Brooks on 22 April 1993. \u201cIn 2014, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) referred to us the conduct of one former officer, who had some involvement with the original investigation into Stephen\u2019s murder, to consider whether that officer had acted corruptly during that investigation. \u201cFollowing exhaustive inquiries, the officer was advised in early 2019 that they were no longer subject to this investigation because there was no indication of corruption on their part in relation to the investigation of Stephen\u2019s murder.\u201d Lawrence\u2019s mother welcomed the decision in a statement. Lady Lawrence said: \u201cI welcome the decision by the IOPC to refer four senior police officers who were involved in leading the investigation into my son\u2019s murder to the Crown Prosecution Service. It is a matter of record that there were many failures in the investigation into Stephen\u2019s murder which led to decades of heartbreak and anguish for me and my family. \u201cIt may now transpire that some of the officers involved were acting unlawfully. If this is the case then it is truly shocking that police officers have been able to act unlawfully and evade prosecution for almost 30 years. If there is evidence of unlawful conduct those responsible should face the full force of the law and I will be taking very careful notice of what the CPS do and say on this issue. \u201cGiven that there may be criminal proceedings to come I do not consider it appropriate to say anything more and will not be commenting further.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
