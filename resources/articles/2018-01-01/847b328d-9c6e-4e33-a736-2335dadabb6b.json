It is a measure of how strongly Albion feel about the matter that on top of putting their grievances in writing on more than one occasion, John Williams, the club\u2019s chairman, contacted Richard Scudamore, the executive chairman of the Premier League, to let it be known just how unhappy they are with the way the fixture list has been organised over the festive period. It is understood that Albion wanted the West Ham game postponed and rescheduled. Although plenty of managers have complained about the Premier League staggering so many matches across different days during the festive period, giving some clubs more time to prepare than others, Albion have a particularly strong argument when it comes to their fixture at the Olympic Stadium. West Ham have not played since Boxing Day because their game against Tottenham Hotspur, which was originally scheduled for New Year\u2019s Eve, had to be moved to 4 January because of safety concerns. Albion, in contrast, hosted Arsenal on Sunday, putting them at a distinct disadvantage for a crucial relegation battle. Alan Pardew described the scheduling as \u201cterrible\u201d and the Albion manager added: \u201cWe all know there\u2019s pressure on TV companies for ratings and everything else and games \u2013 I understand that. But the league\u2019s got to be stronger and say two days is not right.\u201d Pardew went on to say the club had made \u201cstrong\u201d representations to the Premier League about the fixture list and insisted he would be forced into changes for the West Ham match. \u201cOf course I am. There\u2019s some players who won\u2019t be able to cope with that [two games in 48 hours],\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be putting them at risk.\u201d It appears that the Premier League have ended up upsetting just about everyone with the fixture schedule, with West Ham also far from impressed that they have to play Spurs only 48 hours after facing Albion. With that in mind, David Moyes warned the combination of relegation fears and a draining run of fixtures this week will damage their chances of winning their FA Cup tie at Shrewsbury Town on Sunday. West Ham dropped back into the bottom three thanks to Bournemouth\u2019s victory against Everton on Saturday and Moyes said the fixture overload could have a negative impact on their third-round tie against Shrewsbury, who are second in League One. Moyes is unhappy with the balance and depth of his squad \u2013 the manager is desperate for reinforcements in defence and midfield this month \u2013 and his decision to play a weakened side in last month\u2019s Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat by Arsenal demonstrated that he will not compromise West Ham\u2019s survival hopes. He said: \u201cIt is going to have a big damage on the FA Cup for us, to have two games in three days and then have to play another three days later in the FA Cup. That\u2019s where it\u2019s taking its toll and the Premier League is eating into dates where the Cup games might be getting used. \u201cI can imagine the questions when we get there [Shrewsbury] and I\u2019m going to be coming in with my tongue hanging out, and the players as well. That will be difficult and we will be needing to use the group. Do I want to win the FA Cup? 100%. But I don\u2019t think it can be where we can damage our league form.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
