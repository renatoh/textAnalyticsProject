But we are not going to achieve this any time soon if most of the women in the current series of The Apprentice have anything to do with it. As a woman who works outside the home and runs a successful business, I am very conscious of being in the minority. I know many other successful female business owners (Liz Earle, Chantal Coady, Linda Bennett, Anya Hindmarch) and many other senior women who have succeeded in organisations largely dominated by men (Sian Westerman at Rothschild &amp; Sons, Helena Morrissey at Bank of New York Mellon, Helen Weir at Lloyds Banking Group). All these women are inspiring role models and know that they are helping to establish the value of senior women in the minds of the \u2013 mainly male \u2013 leaders of Britain's biggest companies. Sadly, not all women are as conscious of their potential to support the cause of female advancement. On Wednesday, the all-female team on The Apprentice, having lost that week's task, had to appear in the boardroom before Lord Sugar and answer for their actions. They were being watched by approximately 7 million people. What followed was a so-called \"watercooler moment\", discussed the next day in offices around the country \u2013 a full-on descent into mayhem as all the women argued with each other about their relative culpability for their failure. The team leader, Laura Moore, who I would have fired immediately, couldn't have worked her way out of a wet paper bag, let alone make a decision or manage a team. This is the UK's most-watched business programme. How are we going to advance the cause of women in the workplace if its female participants descend into a catfight when things don't go their way? All that is doing is reinforcing the stereotype that exists in men's minds. Some call for quotas in the boardroom, as happens in Norway. I am against it. It brings quantity, not quality, to the boardroom. More women, of itself, will not improve governance or corporate decision-making. Remember the company Wrapit? Its female founder and co-director, Pepita Diamond, was banned as acting as a company director for seven years after Insolvency Service investigators found that she had assisted in making \u00a3243,445 of false credit card refunds in the summer of 2008. Enron was the seventh largest company in the US before it was brought down by accounting fraud. It had a woman on the board. Just the one, mind you, Wendy Gramm, but she was on the audit committee. Good examples matter. I employ a lot of women, and they will go far, which will support the cause of their gender. That's what we need, not more regulation. Karren Brady knows that and pointed it out to the women on The Apprentice. They could do worse than look to Stella English, the woman moved to the men's team who led them to victory. She's a much better example of the kind of woman who will help us get more women into the boardrooms of Britain. Without quotas.
