Virtually every operator has been forced to cut room rates as vacancy levels rise. But for individual business travellers or corporate travel account managers now is a once in a decade opportunity to get bargain rates or renegotiate existing contracts. The last time things were this grim was during the Gulf War in 1991. For hoteliers, it was bad before 11 September. The slowing US economy and the Japanese recession meant international business travel was in decline. The terrorist attacks in New York forced many companies to shelve international travel - some for the rest of the year - for security and financial reasons and to use video conferencing - a dirty word in the hotel trade. In London, revenue per available room - the industry benchmark - has fallen by a massive 37 per cent. Hoteliers with a major presence in international gateway cities, which rely on business from the United States, face the biggest challenge. Hilton, which has 11 hotels in London, said it had a 31.2 per cent 'revpar' drop since September. PKF, the business consultancy, said London room rates have dropped nearly 14 per cent and occupancy dipped 23 per cent in the final weeks of November. This month, industry revpar is expected to recover slightly. 'We expect to see a further softening of rates but occupation to improve,' said Melvin Gold, managing director of hotel consultancy at PKF. The Savoy Group told The Observer that occupancy at its five London hotels fell to 55 per cent immediately after the attacks. Last month they edged up to just under 75 per cent, compared with upwards of 85 per cent in recent years. 'We're still significantly down from where we should be,' said John Kukral, managing director of Savoy Group owner Blackstone. 'Clearly, no one's taking unnecessary trips.' To retain clients the Savoy is offering discounted room rates previously agreed even if fewer bedrooms are needed. The Marriott chain, operated by Whitbread in the UK, is not reducing room rates. A spokeswoman said: 'We're not going to offload rooms, it could change the nature of the business. It's difficult to renose the business after.' Queens Moat House is squeezing rates if clients guarantee loyalty by reducing the number of hotel operators it uses. Other QMH marketing tactics include 50 per cent off conference costs during the first three months of next year. The Copthorne Hotel at Gatwick is offering free video conferencing faciities and developing Partnercard, a loyalty card, to be launched in the spring. There are growth markets. Regions doing good business are Germany, Scandinavia and the UK provinces which don't rely on US business. Marriott say travel within continents is holding up, particularly in the Gulf. Accor - the French owned hotel group which runs Sofitel, Novotel and Mecure - says its revpar is down by 10 per cent - but that's well below the industry average. 'Accor has a far higher visibility in European markets and the business market has held up reasonably well,' said Accor's managing director Michael Flaxman. Next year's outlook is uncertain. The first week in December has indicated that the US traveller is coming back. But if there is another terrorist attack or the economy fails to recover, then all bets are off. However, most hoteliers expect to see recovery in the second half of next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
