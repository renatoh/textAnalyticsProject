On Thursday the home affairs minister was objecting to laws that allow critically ill refugees and asylum seekers to get treatment in Australia, when he claimed that many of the 1,000 or so brought to Australia were not actually sick. \u201cSome people are trying it on,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s be serious about this. There are people who have claimed that they\u2019ve been raped and came to Australia to seek an abortion because they couldn\u2019t get an abortion on Nauru. They arrived in Australia and then decided they were not going to have an abortion. They have the baby here and the moment they step off the plane their lawyers lodge papers in the federal court, which injuncts us from sending them back.\u201d Dutton provided no details to back his claim, including the number of cases he believed were \u201ctrying it on\u201d, but lawyers who have acted for multiple rape victims on Nauru said this applied to none of their clients. Jennifer Kanis, principal solicitor for social justice practise at Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, said the rapes of the women her firm represented had been reported and documented by authorities. \u201cThese are women who are victims of violent crimes and to say that their motivation is anything other than wanting to recover from those crimes is disappointing,\u201d she said. Kanis said the women and children who had been sexually assaulted while on Nauru had been physically and psychologically affected by their harrowing experiences. \u201cThe minister would have the same information about our clients that I have, which makes it so disappointing to see them being miscast as anything other than people who have suffered a horrendous crime and who need medical attention.\u201d Kanis also defended moves by people to seek injunctions, saying that to return someone after medical care would place them back in harm\u2019s way and exacerbate their illnesses. George Newhouse, the principal solicitor at the National Justice Project, said the women who had been raped and needed abortions in Australia had been traumatised. \u201cTheir lives were violated and destroyed under the minister\u2019s watch,\u201d he said. \u201cUsing them for political gain re-traumatises them. \u201cI know of cases where women were raped under his watch and needed termination, and the fact he\u2019s using them as political cannon fodder is an absolute disgrace.\u201d Clare O\u2019Connor, SC, who co-authored a report on detained women in Nauru, accused Dutton of going after an \u201ceasy target\u201d in attacking rape victims. \u201cMost of the complaints about [the government\u2019s] failures to provide adequate health care involve the mental deterioration of children, and what is he going to say about that?\u201d she said. \u201cSo he picks on women because it\u2019s easy to say women make things up. He isn\u2019t the first and won\u2019t be the last to say these sorts of things about women who report sexual assault.\u201d O\u2019Connor noted the government\u2019s own files indicated that many women were victims of assault on Nauru but often did not report it. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said Dutton\u2019s comments were \u201cvile and offensive\u201d. \u201cPeter Dutton\u2019s attempts to politicise reproductive health needs of women is truly appalling,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cHe has a horrific history of attempting to prevent vulnerable refugee women from coming to Australia for medical reasons. His attempt to smear women seeking asylum is disgusting but not surprising.\u201d The medevac laws streamline and codify processes for refugees and asylum seekers who require care they are not receiving in Papua New Guinea or Nauru, and follow several years of complaints that transfer requests under the previous system were being blocked or ignored by the Australian and Nauruan governments. During the Sky News interview, Dutton also suggested the government was better placed to return people under the already existing medical transfer mechanisms than it was under the medevac law. Kanis said there was \u201cno difference\u201d between the two systems when it came to returning people. \u201cThe medevac legislation doesn\u2019t change anything about when someone can be returned or not,\u201d she said. \u201cThe medevac legislation was about putting in place a system whereby people can get the medical attention they need in a timely fashion, and to dispose of this ridiculous situation we had last year where very ill people had to get court orders for urgent medical attention.\u201d Guardian Australia contacted the home affairs minister for comment. The offices of the prime minister, opposition leader and both the minister and shadow minister for women declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
