The former Chelsea trainee's two goals gave Joe Royle's side their first win in five league games and destroyed Leeds' unbeaten home record. Parkin was brought to Portman Road during the summer on a four-year deal from League One side Swindon to replace the departed Darren Bent and Shefki Kuqi. And clinical strikes in either half suggested the \u00a3550,000 signing is up to the task. Parkin scored with an excellent header from Dean Bowditch's cross shortly before the half-hour and added another cool finish in the 70th minute to secure the points. Those goals were a fitting response to the criticism from the Ipswich supporters who have questioned Parkin's ability to make the grade at Portman Road. However, Richard Cresswell's first-half penalty miss epitomised the home side's wastefulness in front of goal while an outstanding rearguard display from Ipswich characterised their performance. 'To be honest, I fancied my chances here,' their manager Royle said. 'I came here with Oldham many, many times and I can't remember losing too often, so it's always been a lucky ground for me. And we definitely rode our luck today.' Narrow failure to reach the Premiership last term forced Royle to sell Kelvin Davis, Tommy Miller, Kuqi and Bent in order to balance the books. By stark contrast, Ken Bates' takeover in January has transformed Leeds' financial health and allowed Kevin Blackwell to spend significant funds on a clutch of players. The Leeds manager, though, was left to rue his side's inability to transform their territorial dominance into goals. Cresswell's penalty miss two minutes before half-time, coupled with Eddie Lewis smacking a first-half shot against the post, left Blackwell deeply frustrated. He said: 'You can be critical about the finishing but it just wouldn't seem to drop. 'And then when it did, the goalkeeper made a great save or the bar and the post were in the way. But we've played well. Despite all the effort, the lads have got nothing to show for it. It's a cruel game.' Man of the match: Sam Parkin - the former Chelsea trainee's killer instinct proved decisive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
