A certain temperament comes into play, but what is most important, for any work of art worth the name, is that you have something to say. This journey towards the light, so to speak, is the central concern of Maurice Gee's new novel, Ellie and the Shadow Man, set in his native New Zealand. Ellie Crowther is a good-natured, unflappable sort of person; an unlikely would-be artist, perhaps, but what she does have is a formidable sense of self. From page one her mother is advising the 14-year-old Ellie to \"just be yourself and then nothing can go wrong\". Wise counsel, but it can be hard to follow when friends, lovers and family will try to shape you to their own moulds - never mind the disabling influence of social norms. And just what does being yourself amount to? Ellie is drawn to people whose difference is palpable: Hollis Prime, crippled by polio; the wry lesbian painter Fan Anerdi; the outspoken writer Miriam Freeman. Yet she aligns herself with men who do not allow her to grow. Mike, the father of her son, is clearly a no-hoper; and in this lazy, easygoing character there is a hint of authorial contempt for those who do not make the best of themselves - who amount to nothing. Ellie also falls for the novelist Neil Higgs, a divorced father of two, in part \"because [he] was prepared to face one way and make his life in that direction\", but he is so nearly an egotistical caricature that it is no surprise when she eventually walks out on him. What is hard to believe is the almost unreasonable calmness with which she does so. Ellie is likeable and admirable, but neither she nor any of the people who cross her path have much flesh-and-blood vitality. And some of the descriptions are simply baffling: \"It was a high-specific-gravity head, set on a body that seemed too light for it.\" It sometimes feels that in his eagerness to convey the bigger picture - that integrity is hard fought-for but worth pursuing - Gee has bypassed ordinary human frailties. Ellie finally starts to paint in her 40s, after experimenting with different lives - as an apple-picker, a gardener in a commune, a librarian, an environmental activist - and raising her son. Simply being an unmarried mother in the New Zealand of the 1960s and 1970s classifies her as an outsider. Gee uses an unfussy chronological narrative, resorting to chapters he calls \"Between Times\" to squeeze in the details of each passing year. This seems a crude device at first, but later displays some of his most vivid writing, as Ellie struggles towards painting that matters, not to anyone else, but to her alone, and towards the painful realisation that \"ideas damaged paintings when they were put in instead of finding their way out\". Vivid, too, is the timeless, unhurried atmosphere of rural life. The shadow man of the title remains elusive for a long time. Could he be Ellie's father, beheaded in a horrific rail accident when she was two, or the enigmatic Hollis Prime, with whom, after a bad start, she will finally develop a loving, unrestricting partnership? It is worth reading this flawed but thoughtful book in order to find out. \u00b7 Nicola Walker is Australasia editor of the TLS."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
