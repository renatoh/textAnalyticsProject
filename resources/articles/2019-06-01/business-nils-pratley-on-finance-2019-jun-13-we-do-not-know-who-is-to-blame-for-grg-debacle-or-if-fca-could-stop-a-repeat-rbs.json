A full six years after Royal Bank of Scotland was accused of gouging thousands of distressed small-business customers, we can finally read the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s definitive account of a shameful chapter for UK banking. Or, since we all already knew the FCA\u2019s independent investigator had found \u201csystematic and widespread\u201d misconduct at GRG, RBS\u2019s restructuring unit, we can learn something more important. Who was to blame? Who will be held to account? Who will find their career in financial services ended by our fearless regulator? The answer is \u2026 nobody. In a 78-page report, the FCA did not identify a single individual. Instead, the document was an extended bleat about the inadequacy of the regulatory tools, circa 2008-13, and an exercise in finding reasons not to name executives. This passage gives a flavour: \u201cWhen we use the term \u2018senior management\u2019 in this report it should not be interpreted as referring to a defined set of individuals.\u201d The FCA, it should be said, has a point about the hole in the regulatory system at the time. Commercial lending was not a regulated activity (and still isn\u2019t), even when the business customers are so small that they are more akin to retail clients. And it was only in 2016 that the Senior Managers Regime, which pins specific responsibilities on individual executives at banks, was introduced. If the FCA could not find evidence of outright dishonesty by individuals at RBS or GRG \u2013 and it swears it couldn\u2019t \u2013 its enforcement powers were limited under the old set-up. Yet the victims of GRG deserved more than an elaborate drawing of the veil and another invitation to claim compensation. The mistreatment was systematic, says the report, because it resulted from the failure \u201cto put in place the appropriate governance and oversight\u201d to manage conflicts between the bank\u2019s interests and those of its customers. But, come on, installing governance safety valves must have been somebody\u2019s job, or at least been a shared responsibility of the board. The entire RBS crew can\u2019t all have been Macavity, the mystery cat. For outsiders, the most alarming part is this: the FCA won\u2019t even say if it could have pursued RBS senior managers if its post-2016 powers had been in place. \u201cThis would involve applying a new regime to a historic set of facts and it would not be appropriate for us to make a hypothetical judgement,\u201d explains the report. Not appropriate? Are we supposed just to hope or trust that the FCA will be able to nail somebody in the next GRG-style debacle? It seems we are. Give Peltz a voice Here comes Nelson Peltz, a name to strike fear in boardrooms. The veteran US activist investor has taken pops at PepsiCo and Procter &amp; Gamble in the recent past and now he\u2019s alighted on Ferguson, the FTSE 100 supplier of heating and plumbing equipment formerly known as Wolseley. Peltz\u2019s funds have bought a 6% stake, worth about \u00a3730m, and want some action. The specific grumble, it seems, is that Ferguson\u2019s shares are less highly rated than those of US peers. City analysts agree with the analysis - they put the discount at 25%-30%, more than you would expect, given that about four-fifths of Ferguson\u2019s business is in the US. But what\u2019s the remedy? If Peltz wants Ferguson to abandon its London listing and move to New York, that\u2019s not easy. As Unilever discovered, those UK funds that are only allowed to hold UK stocks tend to cling to what they\u2019ve got. A relisting proposal requires a 75% majority, a high hurdle. Indeed, UK investors may conclude that they\u2019ve now got the best of both worlds \u2013 a London-listed stock plus a famous US investor broadcasting his view that the shares are too cheap. The best course: let Peltz shout and see if the shares rerate. They improved 6% on Thursday, which is a start. Field still waiting for Green assurance For proper shouting, there\u2019s Sir Philip Green. \u201cThese people writing all this shit couldn\u2019t spell 50 quid,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThey all get jealous. The fact that someone can actually write out a cheque and writes one out, people don\u2019t like it.\u201d For the record, Sir Phil, we did like the \u00a3363m for the BHS pension fund. But will you also fully fund pensions at Arcadia beyond this week\u2019s pledges, even if your high hopes for reviving the business don\u2019t work out? Frank Field MP has requested a personal binding assurance and, as far as one can tell, he\u2019s still waiting to see it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
