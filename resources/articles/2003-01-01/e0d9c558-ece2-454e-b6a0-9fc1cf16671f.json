There are plenty of similarities to neighbouring Paris, but Brussels is more down-to-earth, so you don't elicit guffaws when you try to speak in French, and chips are a chic rather than a cheap side dish (frites are proudly served at Michelin-starred restaurants). Where to eat Apparently, Belgians eat out more than any other nation (there are 1,800 restaurants in Brussels). Eating out is a national pastime here, so come mealtimes, especially lunch, you can forget trying to get a table at a popular eatery unless you book well in advance. However, the upside of this national passion is that snob value is minimal, and the focus is on honest, well-cooked food served in a low-key environment. As a rule, if the food is good, so is the atmosphere. Place Sainte-Catherine and the Sablon district are renowned for their gastronomy. Place du Grand Sablon is the old aristocratic quarter, filled to the gills with high-class antique shops, reasonably priced restaurants, cafes and chocolate shops. A great area to visit for brunch. Authentic Belgian restaurants tend to have wood-panelled walls, rickety furniture and stone and tiled floors. De Heof (218, Rue Edith Cavell, +00 32 2 374 34 17) is a superb steak house in in Uccle, south Brussels, with red-and-white checked tablecloths and an open fire. The steak with b\u00e9arnaise sauce and frites is to die for, and their three-course fixed price menu works out at just over \u00a340 a head, which for the taste, quality and service, is a bargain. Even the more upmarket restaurants have a welcoming atmosphere. Le Belga Queen (Rue Foss\u00e9-aux-Loups, 32 B-1000, +32 2 217 21 87, belgaqueen@busmail.net) is a former bank in which you'll find high ceilings, high earners and high quality Belgian food. One word of warning, though: the trendy toilet doors are made of glass and only \"frost up\" when the door is properly locked. The restaurants around the world heritage site Grand-Place are a magnet for tourists, but you are just as likely to find the Bruxellois among the throng of diners. The rue des Bouchers area, between the Place and the covered galleries, is romantic and atmospheric with its candlelit terrace tables and lavish displays of seafood. But the ambience and cuisine come at a price. Those with a sweet tooth should make their way to Le Pain Quotidien (11, rue des Sablons, +32 2 513 51 54) for the best cakes and pastries. Try a pistolet , which are to Belgians what croissants are to the French. The famous biscuit shop and tearoom Dandroy Biscuiterie (31, rue au Beurre, +32 2 511 03 26) is located between the Grand-Place and the Bourse. It is one of the most renowned creators of fine baked goods in the country and has been family owned and run for six generations, using original recipes. Speculoos - traditional cookies from the gingerbread family - are given to well-behaved children during the celebration of Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of Belgium, on December 6. Pain d'almond - spiced biscuits sprinkled with chipped almonds - are definitely worth bringing home, too (although they probably won't last the Eurostar journey). Window shopping for food doesn't get better than at Claire Fontaine , (Rue Ernest Allard 3, +32 2 512 24 10), a traditional deli with orange, chocolate brown and even bright pink sausages which will test your pre-conditioned colour and taste association to the max. The sandwiches are legendary. Local specialities include: croquettes of small shrimps/shrimp paste coated in breadcrumbs and deep-fried; waterzooi, a creamy chicken stew; tartar steak with frites; and mussels and frites. Where to drink For a city that takes its beer seriously, what to drink in Brussels is as important as where to drink it. There are hundreds of taverns dotted around the city serving more than 400 different beers, most in different shaped glasses. Expect to browse long drinks menus that include speciality fruit beers. However, it is wise to pay attention to the alcohol content. La Becasse (11, Rue de Tabora straat, +32 2 511 00 06) is an authentic old tavern where they serve blonde beer in terracotta jugs. Where to eat chocolate Marcolini (39 place du Grand Sablon, +32 2 514 12 06) is one of the most famous chocolate shops in Belgium, and even has a chocolate fountain in the window - a sophisticated small-scale version of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory that looks like it's drilling pure chocolate from the core of the earth. The pralines with different centres and the truffles are also good. Neuhaus (25-27 Galerie de la Reine, +32 2 512 63 59, neuheus.be) is another exquisite chocolate shop located in St Herberts Galleries (see below), complete with piped music and fresh flowers. At the other end of the spectrum, obtaining a chocolate hit on the street is easy - vans on street corners sell waffles for 1.5 euros. Chocoholics should also squeeze in a visit to the Museum of Cocoa and Chocolate (13 Grand-Place, +32 2 514 20 48, mucc.be). Where to shop Brussels is surprisingly rewarding for fashion and homeware. An abundance of fabulous small fashion boutiques champion established Belgian couturiers such as Dries Van Noten, along with new designers who enjoy nearby Antwerp's growing buzz as a fashion centre. Try Stijl (74 rue Antoine Dansaert, 1000 +322 512 0313) for a broad choice for men and women. Home decor bargains such as lampshades, fabrics and huge sofas can be obtained at New de Wolf, (91 rue Haute/ 40 rue Blaes, +32 2 511 1018), one of Brussels's many quirky and original homeware stores. For a more sophisticated experience, visit Galeries Saint Hubert on Rue du Marche-aux-Herbes, a complex of beautiful covered arcades built in 1847. The glass roofs were the first of their kind in Europe. What to see It may be the headquarters of the European Union, Nato and other international organisations, but Brussels does have a lighter side. It's the birthplace of Herg\u00e9 and his adventurous comic strip star Tintin. They are celebrated, along with compatriots The Smurfs at The Belgian Centre for Comic Strips (20 Rue des Sables, +32 22 191 980), housed in a magnificent art-nouveau warehouse. Where to sleep Located at the heart of the city on fashionable Avenue Louise, where you can shop to your heart's content, the Conrad Brussels (+32 2 542 48 00, conradhotels.com, or via the Hilton Reservations worldwide office on 08705 909090) is a grand hotel oozing traditional charm. The deluxe rooms are huge (555 euros) and guests have access to the Champneys Brussels health and fitness club. The Hotel Amigo (a Rocco Forte hotel) stands next to the Grand-Place and combines art deco style with traditional features like an 18th-century Flanders wall tapestry and smooth paving stones that were originally used in the surrounding streets in 1600.
