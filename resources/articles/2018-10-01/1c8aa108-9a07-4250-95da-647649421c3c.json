Claire Waxman from the Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime (Mopac) has written to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) saying victims were routinely being told their cases would be dropped unless they signed consent forms that gave defence lawyers and their alleged attacker access to intimate details of their lives that could be revealed in court. \u201cVictims are very concerned that they are being asked for so much sensitive material \u2013 not only their phones, but also past medical history, their social services records and more,\u201d said Waxman. \u201cVictims often don\u2019t feel it useful, relevant or reasonable, but have to give consent it if they want to access justice. The justice process has just lot a grip on this; on the ground it is getting worse and worse.\u201d Last month the Guardian revealed that police were demanding almost unfettered access to records and data from possible rape victims including in some cases health, school and college records and counselling notes. In London, the Metropolitan police ask for access to social media, web browsing activity and content, instant messages, location data, emails, deleted data, images, videos, audio files, apps, contacts, documents, MMS and SMS messages \u2013 which can be kept for up to 100 years. Women are routinely asked to sign consent forms, known as Stafford statements, to permit access to the data. But Waxman argued that because women were told their case would not proceed without the consent, they were left with little real choice, which may make the process unlawful under new data protection laws. The letter, seen by the Guardian, said that while the consent forms provided the \u201clawful basis\u201d for the access, \u201cthey are falling way short of meeting the high standard\u201d set under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules. Waxman has heard from a series of women whose cases give a worrying insight into data collection. They include: A woman who had reported pre-mobile phone era historic abuse whose case was dropped when she would not consent to handing over her current phone. A woman who was questioned by police on private conversations recorded accidentally by her phone during a period of 72 hours. A woman who reported rape by a stranger whose case was dropped because she would not consent to her data being handed to the Crown Prosecution Service. In the letter, Waxman said there was a stark disparity between the rights given to defendants and victims where \u201cpolice rely on Pace [Police and Criminal Evidence Act] to extract the data from the phones of suspects, which sets out clear, transparent and stringent parameters that must be adhered to\u201d. She added: \u201cIf we are putting victims on trial \u2013 and by putting them through this investigatory process let\u2019s be honest we are \u2013 then they should be afforded the same rights under a free trial and they are not.\u201d Police and the CPS have come under increasing pressure to examine vast amounts of data after several high-profile rape trials collapsed the end of last years and the beginning of this year when text and social media exchanges belatedly emerged that undermined complainants\u2019 accounts. But the current system of police trawling through tens of thousands of messages and photographs was \u201cunrealistic and unworkable\u201d and was resulting in huge delays to cases being brought to trial, said Waxman. \u201cI think in light of what happened early this year the CPS had a blanket idea of \u2018let\u2019s get all information possible\u2019, and that is completely the wrong way around,\u201d she said. Waxman added: \u201cWe are in a situation where the system is completely blocked, and nothing is getting through. That is not a justice process that is working \u2013 we are in a critical situation and it has to be tackled.\u201d An ICO spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of the concerns about the processing of victims\u2019 personal information and are in the early stages of considering the issues.\u201d \u2018I felt like I was under surveillance\u2019 Anna* made a rape complaint to police in 2016 after discovering a man who she said raped her when she was unconscious six years earlier had been suspended from his company following a similar complaint. Having provided evidence to police, her case was to be held alongside the other woman\u2019s. But when the trial opened in January this year, the day another trial collapsed because of the late disclosure of digital evidence, her phone was seized and the trial delayed. \u201cThe way police spoke to me, I felt ambushed and felt like I was a perpetrator and not a complainant,\u201d she said. Anna signed a statement that enabled police to look through all her digital data and medical records and hand over this information to the CPS, which would make it accessible to the defence. She discovered that after recording a conversation for work, her phone had continued recording her life for the next 72 hours, which was then analysed by police officers without sexual offence training. \u201cIt was a fishing expedition, clear and simple,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I was under surveillance.\u201d She was told by the CPS that her case was being dropped because of WhatsApp messages between her and her partner which they said could be perceived as evidence that she had been discussing the case and could have been \u201ccoached\u201d. The trial went ahead with only one complainant, and the defendant was found not guilty. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he won\u2019t do it again, but he\u2019s now free,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not in prison, so who knows what he might do?\u201d *Anna\u2019s name has been changed to protect her identity The letter has also been signed by the End Violence Against Women coalition, Liberty, Rape Crisis, the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, the Survivors Trust, and Joan Smith chair of the VAWG Board."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
