At a press round table in London, when Ballmer talked about the continued growth in sales of PCs and other devices, he admitted: \"Security is the potential downside for the business. That is, do people have enough faith in the reliability and security of these intelligent devices that they will entrust [them with] a greater and greater percentage of the information they deal with every day? \"If we don't get things right on the security front, (a) we're not doing what our customers want, and (b) I don't think we're doing those things which are going to allow our industry to continue to grow, and us to grow with it.\" This echoes a memo Bill Gates sent to Microsoft staff in January 2002, when he launched his Trustworthy Computing initiative. There's been a long wait for any real benefits, but Ballmer cites Windows XP's long-delayed Service Pack 2 as one example. SP2, says Ballmer, was \"a major browser release\", which is why he thinks it is funny that people are complaining about the lack of new features in Internet Explorer. \"We pushed them back a little bit, I admit that,\" he says, thumping the table. \"Do I know that there is a list of features as long as my arm that people would like to see? Absolutely yes, we're hard at work on them. But we thought the immediate priority was to address the issues around security and reliability.\" However, not every user is on Windows XP, and not every XP user will install SP2. \"We can never say to people: 'the answer to all security problems is to upgrade to the latest version',\" Ballmer replies. \"That's why we talk about the need for isolation, with network quarantine technology, firewalls... More of this needs to happen.\" The biggest threat, \"at least in corporates,\" he says, \"is with machines that are on their networks sometimes and off their networks at other times. The machines get infected when they are off the network, and when they are re-attached, they bring the virus ... \" At Microsoft, therefore, PCs are checked for patches and scanned for viruses before they are allowed to connect to the network. Ballmer reckons this \"quarantine technology\" will be shipped \"certainly by Longhorn, but the goal is to be before\". Security threats can be reduced but not eliminated. \"We will be working on Trustworthy Computing for the rest of my days at Microsoft, which I hope are many,\" says Ballmer. \"There are bad people out there in cyberspace, so to speak: they're not going to go away. I'd love to tell you that all vulnerabilities will disappear in n years, but I wouldn't believe that, and nobody else would, either.\" Still, Microsoft knows it must make the cost and pain of dealing with security threats lower than the cost and pain of switching to an alternative. Will it make it?
