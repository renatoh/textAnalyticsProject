The Patriots, for whom it will be a second appearance in three years, and a third in eight, were rated as contenders for Reliant Stadium from the opening day of the season but Carolina were given precious little hope, the more so as only two seasons ago they finished with a dismal record of won one, lost 15. Their final game that term was against New England on January 6 - the last regular-season meeting between the teams. The Patriots won it 38-6 to wrap up the AFC East title and hand the Panthers that record 15th defeat in front of a nearly empty stadium. The coach George Seifert, who had won two rings with the 49ers, was fired the next morning, and the Patriots went on to win the 2002 Super Bowl. The Panthers now have the opportunity to win one of their own after taking the NFC championship game on Sunday 14-3 against the Philadelphia Eagles, who for the third time in as many years stumbled at the last. In doing so they became the first team to complete that unfortunate hat-trick since the Dallas Cowboys of 1980-82. Though the Panthers' win may have come as a shock to some, there were no surprises from the team who employed their usual tactics - a punishing ground attack in tandem with a relentless defence that focused on and harassed the quarterback Donovan McNabb. \"That's the way the NFL is, to be in a league where you can have a season like that and two years later be in the Super Bowl,\" said the Panthers' defensive end Michael Rucker. \"It's going to be a great game and we're looking forward to it.\" However, it will be New England, the first team to win 14 consecutive games since the unbeaten 1972 Miami Dolphins, who start as favourites following a 24-14 defeat of the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC title game. Their defensive back Ty Law stole the show in a snowy and soggy Gillette Stadium, picking off three of Peyton Manning's passes. \"I just took advantage,\" he said. \"A couple of the balls didn't have a lot of zip so I could capitalise. We came here expecting to win, if we played hard and played together, but this is not the ultimate goal. It's to go to Houston and win.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
