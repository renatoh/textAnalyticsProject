Among mayor Rudy Giuliani's many edicts has been to ban certain animals, like snakes and alligators, from the city limits. It seems salamanders and newts were not on the list. That may have helped Mr Livingstone strike a more conciliatory tone towards the mayor he once branded as insensitive to blacks. \"When you meet someone in person it's always different than when you read about them in the press,\" said Mr Livingstone following a breakfast meeting with Mr Giuliani at the mayor's Manhattan residence, Gracie Mansion. The two mayors, iconoclasts after their own fashion, appeared to warm to each other over the ham, eggs and bagels. This was despite the fact that the press release from Mr Giuliani's office never mentioned Mr Livingstone's appearance at the prayer breakfast in honour of Martin Luther King, who's birthday yesterday was a national holiday. \"Though we come from opposite political wings, we face very similar problems and have similar solutions,\" Mr Livingstone said. Among those problems is fighting crime and Mr Giuliani never loses an opportunity to boast that New York crime was again cut last year by nearly 6%. There were still more than 600 homicides in New York City last year, three times as many as in London. But Mr Livingstone wants to raise London boroughs' tax revenues to add more police and sought Mr Giuliani's advice on how to deploy them. The London mayor also praised his counterpart's success in reducing the number of New Yorkers on the dole by 400,000, though only 119,000 jobs were found for them. Mr Livingstone, eyeing a development plan for Trafalgar and Parliament squares, wants to hear, when he sits down with Mr Giuliani today, how New York has turned the porn capital of America, Times Square, into a Disneyfied business and media mecca in a few years. London's mayor visited companies in Wall Street and the Downtown Business Alliance's neighbourhood, on which he would like to model the new Oxford Street business district. He later tried to drum up American investment for London at a World Trade Center lunch. After lunch, Mr Livingstone again rode Bob Kiley's upgraded subway to Harlem, where he was to meet black business leaders of the Upper Manhattan empowerment zone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
