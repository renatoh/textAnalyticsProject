Although the Premier League side emerged with a 2-0 victory, Wenger suggested the idea of managing at National League level was so tough he would not want to take it on. Job done? \u201cYes, against a side that was astonishing,\u201d said Wenger. \u201cIt is basically division five, and they are 17th out of 24. I will never go down there to manage because it is too difficult,\u201d he said. Goals from Lucas P\u00e9rez and Theo Walcott, with his 100th for Arsenal, tilted the tie but Sutton were not without chances of their own. Wenger, who used Alexis S\u00e1nchez as a late substitute, argued that it was not a challenge he could take easily. \u201cI must give credit to the players who were professional and kept their focus, if we had come here in a relaxed mood we would have gone out tonight because they produced quality,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we could not afford a light team selection tonight and that is why I came with basically all the players who were available because we couldn\u2019t afford to go out \u2013 we can never afford it.\u201d The romantic in Wenger enjoyed his visit to less salubrious surroundings than he is used to. \u201cI come from a club that is smaller than that so it reminds me of my childhood. The changing rooms for me were fantastic \u2013 the closer you are, the more united you are when you go out there,\u201d he said. The flipside of the more open and less security-orientated atmosphere was that a bottle of mineral water was thrown in Wenger\u2019s direction. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was at me or someone else or the referee but there was a bottle thrown, yes,\u201d he remarked. The Sutton manager, Paul Doswell, was clearly emotional at the end of it all after a whirlwind few weeks. He was full of admiration for his players. \u201cWe have done the non-league proud,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are 105 places above us in the pyramid. Those lads won\u2019t walk properly tomorrow. The problem in sport is when you have lost you feel disappointed but they put this club on a worldwide map.\u201d Doswell found it bizarre to host a game where the opposition arrived with bodyguards. \u201c It is a different world,\u201d he said. \u201cMy lot will go to work tomorrow. They are movie stars with James Bond security. You can\u2019t get near them.\u201d It was more of an observation than a direct criticism. \u201cI totally get it. Unfortunately that\u2019s the world we live in. I saw a few idiots shouting and screaming at Wenger and Arsenal players. They\u2019ve got to be protected from those type of people.\u201d Doswell was also touched by the fact Arsenal have offered to donate \u00a350,000 towards Sutton\u2019s charitable work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
