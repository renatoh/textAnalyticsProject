The scam involves fraudsters sending generous - but bogus - donations by cheque, then later asking the charity to repay half the sum because of a supposed \"administrative error\". If unsuspecting charities repay this money, they find that the original cheque bounces, leaving them robbed of thousands of pounds. The ruse was uncovered by the Brian Byrnes Memorial Fund, a charity that supports Bangladeshi orphans, when it received a cheque for \u00a34,500 - an amount that would have quadrupled its income. Before the charity cashed the cheque in, it was asked to return \u00a32,500 to a different bank account. Peter Byrnes, chairman of the fund's trustees, said: \"It was so believable - the cheque was from a genuine bank and I spoke to the donor on the phone several times. \"We're used to spotting scams, but because we received a cheque from an individual, we took it as legitimate. I'm just relieved we didn't make any repayment, as the cheque bounced.\" The Charity Commission has warned that small charities are particularly at risk from the scam. More than 100,000 charities have an income of less than \u00a310,000 and the fraud could wipe out a significant chunk of their income. Director of operations, Simon Gillespie, said: \"This is a very sinister operation because it is so plausible. Charities should never return any donation before the cheque has cleared. \"These type of requests should be treated with great caution and if trustees have any suspicions they should contact their local police or call the commission's helpline on 0870 333 0123. We want all charities to be alert to this scam.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
