After a month of campaign on asylum, immigration, abortion and gypsies, the Conservative leader took time to pay tribute to Britain's public service workers. And he called for a \"liberation\" of the \"hard working forgotten majority\" let down by Tony Blair. In a speech to activists in London which repeated many of the leitmotifs of recent campaigning - it will be a phrase redolent of John Major's small \"c\" conservatism that attracts most attention. Five weeks out from a likely May 5 election, he told supporters: \"I believe fair play matters. The same rules should apply whatever your background, whatever your religion, whatever your sex. We are all British. We are one nation.\" In the lexicon of Conservatism, \"one nation\" Toryism stands for the centre-ground consensus politics of former prime ministers such as Edward Heath and Mr Major. That \"fair play\" was called into question by Labour today, as campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp demanded to know if the Tory leader would be meeting the controversial new Australian pollster Mark Textor. Dubbing him a \"dirty tricks expert\" for his alleged role in \"push polling\" - where negative misinformation is fed to voters in the form of opinion polling - Mr Fraser demanded to who Mr Textor would be meeting and where he would be going when he arrived in the UK this weekend. Mr Kemp said \"I know Textor has already met David Davis [the shadow home secretary]. \"The Tories have been embarrassed the revelation of Textor's role in dirty tricks - but they are still happy to have him work on their campaign,\" he said. \"It is just another example of their opportunism and desperation and it tells us everything about their judgement.\" The Tory leader spoke of public service being \"a noble calling\", which should be \"honoured and rewarded\". He told of his \"ugly house\" in his Kent constituency, but spoke of the \"glorious view\" of the Channel, and the importance of maritime trade to Britain's history. Calling the speech \"The Britain I Believe In\", Mr Howard said he was \"intensely grateful\" not to have been born in France, and paid tribute to the \"inspiring men and women who take risks to British business\". Although Mr Howard did mention immigration controls, pointing out again he was the child of immigrants himself, it was a far more low-key speech than some of his recent inflammatory attacks on the government. He promised to take \"a blowtorch to paperwork\" and help parents get their children into a good school without going through \"an assault course or a lottery\". In an apparent bid to head off charges of playing the race card, which have been levelled at the party since it called for quotas for immigration and asylum, Mr Howard paid tribute to the black soldier recently awarded the Victoria Cross. He said:\" For me, the most moving experience of recent weeks has been learning about the quiet heroism of Private Johnson Beharry VC. And it's not just for his bravery. That humbles all of us who have never served in combat. \"That a young man from Grenada, a small island in the Caribbean, with deep and long-standing ties to Britain, should become the first living recipient of the Victoria Cross in 36 years says something remarkable about Britain too. \"It reminds us that Britain is bigger than the area bounded by the shores of this island and that for many people beyond our shores, British values stand for something in the world.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
