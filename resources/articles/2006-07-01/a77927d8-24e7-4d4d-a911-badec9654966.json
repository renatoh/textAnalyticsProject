The Frenchman has overseen an overhaul of the Rangers playing staff, which remains far from complete, and introduced a stringent fitness regime for all players. On top of that a 10-day trip to South Africa meant Le Guen has had little time to assess the quality of opposition in the Scottish Premierleague. The former Lyon manager's tenure begins in earnest when Rangers travel to Motherwell tomorrow. Le Guen attended Celtic's 3-0 defeat by Manchester United on Wednesday but said that taught him little about the side from whom Rangers will attempt to wrestle the SPL championship. \"It was unimportant because there is nothing like a competitive game,\" said Le Guen. \"Celtic played without many important players, so things will be so different when the season starts.\" Le Guen is worried about the fitness of his captain Barry Ferguson. The midfielder suffered a heel injury in South Africa which may sideline him for another five weeks. Ferguson underwent ankle surgery at the end of last season but had planned to take part tomorrow before his latest setback. The Rangers manager had better news, however, of the Austria Vienna striker Filip Sebo. The Slovak has continually stated a desire to move to Ibrox and Rangers hope to conclude a \u00a32m move for the 22-year-old before facing Dundee United next weekend. Celtic's manager Gordon Strachan has reiterated a desire to add to his squad after a dismal pre-season which yielded two goals in seven games. Strachan said: \"If I were happy with the squad, I wouldn't actively be seeking new players.\" Celtic miss the injured Shaun Maloney and suspended captain Neil Lennon for today's visit of Kilmarnock."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
