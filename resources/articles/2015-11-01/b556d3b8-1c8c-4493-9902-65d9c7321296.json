A police force confirmed that it was contacted by a 19-year-old man who said he faced demands for money to stop sexually explicit images from being released on the internet. Officers have not been able to identify the alleged blackmailer, they said. Friends of the man, who is a Tory activist, claim that the blackmail attempt from a Skype account arrived when he was due to give evidence of harassment against women by Mark Clarke, who has since been accused of bullying several male colleagues and sexually assaulting a number of female activists. Clarke was expelled from the Conservative party for life earlier this week after it was claimed that his behaviour was a factor in another young activist believed to have killed himself. Clarke has vigorously denied any wrongdoing and claims that he was also targeted by the same fake account. A spokesman for Kent police said: \u201cA man contacted the police on 4 September alleging that he was being blackmailed by strangers. The crime was recorded and enquiries were carried out, but no suspects have been identified.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, Clarke said: \u201cI welcome any police investigation into this matter. I was also targeted by this fake account while in bed with my wife, who was a witness to the attempt. \u201cI hope that they find the culprit and, of course in this tech-enabled age, it is relatively straightforward to prove or disprove such matters if there is a suspect.\u201d Clarke denied any knowledge of reports in the Daily Mail that a female activist has reported him the to the police. \u201cI deny all such allegations,\u201d he said. The developments will deepen intrigue around Clarke as senior party figures struggle to explain why they failed to investigate claims that sexual assault, bullying, drug-taking and blackmail were rife in the party\u2019s youth wing as recently as this summer. It has come after the father of the young Tory activist who is believed to have killed himself after being bullied by Clarke has called for senior members of the party to \u201ccome clean\u201d over the scandal. Clarke, who lost to Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan in Tooting, south London, in 2010, was accused of bullying by 21-year-old Elliott Johnson before he died. The Tories revealed on Thursday that former party chairman Grant Shapps was responsible for recruiting Clarke. It has previously been reported that Clarke was leaning on Johnson to retract a complaint he had made about him to Conservative campaign headquarters. Ray Johnson, Elliott\u2019s father, said: \u201cOne thing is certain, the Johnson family will not stop until those who leaked our son\u2019s complaint to Clarke are outed and those responsible for tolerating \u2013 or worse, encouraging Clarke and his minions \u2013 are exposed for all to see. \u201cThe Conservative party owe it to Elliott\u2019s memory and all those young activists who have suffered at the hands of Clarke. They must come clean.\u201d The party had been investigating Clarke since before Johnson\u2019s death in September. A number of whistleblowers have come forward to allege that Clarke, who ran the RoadTrip2015 campaign that bussed young activists around the country, was engaged in inappropriate behaviour. Robert Halfon, deputy chairman of the party, was warned before the election that Clarke could try to blackmail him about an affair with a Tory activist. Ben Howlett, a Conservative MP, told BBC Newsnight this week that he had warned the party leadership about Clarke\u2019s behaviour and felt personally bullied in a way that affected his health. Shapps\u2019s former chief-of-staff Paul Abbott said that he complained internally about Clarke in 2014, but that Clarke\u2019s behaviour had worsened this year leading to much more serious claims. \u201cThis year, I made several formal complaints to the party about his behaviour, along with other young people who he has tried to blackmail or threaten,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is an appalling man and I wish I had never met him.\u201d In the latest accusations, a whistleblower alleged to the Daily Mail there were concerns about Clarke going back at least seven years, which she said she had sent to the party leadership and Downing Street. She claimed Clarke had compiled dossiers on Tory MPs after encouraging young activists to sleep with them and threatened to destroy her after she turned down an unwanted sexual advance. Clarke has claimed the latest allegations are untrue. Clarke was praised for his work for the RoadTrip2015 campaign by David Cameron during this year\u2019s election. In July, the prime minister personally told the Conservative National Convention that Clarke\u2019s RoadTrip campaign would continue until 2020. In response to the latest allegations, a Conservative spokeswoman has released a lengthy statement that reveals Shapps brought Clarke on board in 2014, in a move that will increase pressure on the Tory chairman to explain whether he had ever been aware of any of the complaints. The party said it would ask an independent lawyer from the law firm Clifford Chance to review its inquiry. \u201cAfter the general election in 2010, all candidates on the old approved list were asked to re-apply for the new list,\u201d said the statement. \u201cThose who applied were interviewed by an assessment panel and a recommendation was put to the candidates committee. Several hundred candidates were not invited back on to the list, including Mark Clarke.\u201d \u201cMark Clarke established RoadTrip2015 on his own initiative to campaign in key constituencies in the runup to the general election. In 2014, Grant Shapps asked Mark Clarke to work in conjunction with ... the party\u2019s own volunteer activist organisation. \u201cWe have been unable to find any written complaints of bullying, harassment or any other inappropriate behaviour during this period that were not dealt with \u2026 The party is continuing with its internal inquiry which began in August 2015 in response to a formal complaint, received by Lord Feldman, about the behaviour of Mark Clarke. The statement encouraged any witnesses to come forward. Clarke has previously released a statement saying: \u201cI believe that these false allegations and this media firestorm are related to the events surrounding Elliott\u2019s sad death. As such, I will be cooperating with the coroner and providing him with the fullest information. This is the proper process. After the inquest, I will look to take legal action for defamation in respect of these allegations.\u201d Johnson, a Nottingham University graduate who worked for the campaign group Conservative Way Forward, was found dead on railway tracks at Sandy station in Bedfordshire on 15 September. He had made a formal complaint to the party about Clarke before his death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
