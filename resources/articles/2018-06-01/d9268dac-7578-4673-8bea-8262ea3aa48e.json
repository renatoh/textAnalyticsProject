Delph\u2019s wife, Natalie, is due on 30 June, two days after the team play Belgium in their final group game in Kaliningrad, with Gareth Southgate having granted the Manchester City midfielder permission to return home to be at her side. That will take priority over representing his country, if selected, in Russia. \u201cGareth\u2019s fine about it and understands how important family is to me, and he\u2019s the same as well,\u201d said Delph, whose teammate Phil Jones left the camp before the pre-tournament friendly against Nigeria while his wife, Kaya, gave birth to their daughter, Alaria. \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken about it a lot. He was away at an England camp and had to fly back to be at the birth of his child, getting there 10 minutes before, apparently. Hopefully I can do the same. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the guys at the FA and asked them to get me a private plane with lots of Champagne on it \u2026 No, they\u2019re going to sort a plane for me. My wife will give me the heads-up \u2013 I\u2019m waiting on the text saying: \u2018Get back home\u2019 \u2013 and I\u2019ll get back as fast as possible. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fantastic squad, great players, and if I am selected to play and I have to make my way back to see my family, there are players more than capable of doing the job I can do, if not a lot better. I\u2019m comfortable with that decision. I don\u2019t think [the hiatus in his tournament] will affect me mentally. Having to travel home and then back again is obviously not ideal, but it\u2019s part of life. I\u2019m about to have my third child and I\u2019m not going to miss it if I can help it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
