There was something satisfying about doing so, knowing that back home everybody else was caught up in the dark mornings and short days of deepest winter. Twenty-four hours earlier I had dashed frantically across a freezing London. At Heathrow airport I rendezvoused with my climbing partner, Russell Banks, who was reading a battered paperback copy of Hemingway's Islands in the Stream. Having flown overnight from New York, he looked as dishevelled and unprepared as I felt. The 19,343 ft of Mount Kilimanjaro was already beginning to feel like folly and we hadn't even left London. Russell and I first talked about this climb in Saratoga Springs during the 2004 summer programme of the New York State Writers Institute. One night, in a bar called The Parting Glass, we found ourselves bragging to each other, and the assembled writing students, about how we had both climbed Kilimanjaro. I had done so three times, and Russell once, but it was some time now since either of us had been on the mountain. Also, Russell had gone up the easier Marangu route, and over drinks I was trying to introduce him to the idea that the more difficult Machame route was the way to go. Predictably, by the time the barman called last orders we had talked ourselves into an expedition. I first met Russell almost 20 years ago at the Harbourfront Writers Festival in Toronto. Late one night, Graham Swift and I were walking sheepishly across a car park, having missed the evening readings, when we were approached by the Swiss author, Nicolas Bouvier, who looked somewhat agitated. Had we heard Banks reading this evening from his novel, Continental Drift? We confessed our absence and an apoplectic Bouvier delivered his verdict. \"But he is a racist.\" I burst out laughing, having correctly assumed that Russell had committed the \"crime\" of daring to read in the vernacular of a West Indian, and had therefore set off all kinds of politically correct alarm bells. Russell Banks's subsequent work has continued to step boldly into this minefield. In June 2000, he published a controversial piece in Harpers magazine entitled \"Who Will Tell the Children?\", in which he argued that the vital American narrative was the African-American story. In the autumn of 2004, his latest novel The Darling, which is set partly in Liberia and explores the life of a middle-class white American woman who marries an African politician, was published to good, if somewhat puzzled, reviews. Traversing boundaries of class, race, and gender is something that seems to come naturally to Russell, but as we settled in for the flight to Nairobi he admitted that he was burned out from all the feedback and debate that had surrounded the American publication of The Darling. He was looking forward to \"hitting the road\", even though we were both a little concerned about the nature of the road we were hitting. After all, only about 50% of those who attempt to climb Kilimanjaro ever make it to the summit, and my own memories of previous climbs included suffering a significant degree of physical pain and enduring the disturbing symptoms of Altitude Mountain Sickness (AMS). The world's tallest free-standing mountain exercises a severe test, and while I knew I wasn't getting any younger, Russell was now 64 and nursing a \"bad\" left knee. Having fought our way clear of downtown Nairobi traffic, the mini-van deposited us both outside a restaurant called Carnivore, where we would have our final meal before flying to Tanzania and beginning the climb proper. Among the choice meats on the menu were crocodile and camel. As we waited for our order, Russell shared his own AMS stories from an earlier climb in Ecuador. This included his noticing an Albanian woman walking into his tent at 19,000 ft and his exchanging snacks and extensive conversation with her. Of course his colleagues didn't see her, and as I was digesting the full lunacy of his story, and exchanging his tale of the Albanian woman for my own memories of seeing luminous red rabbits the first time I went up Kilimanjaro, the waiter asked us if we were finished. \"Oh no,\" said the intrepid Mr Banks. \"We'll both have a little more of the camel, please.\" Moshi, in northern Tanzania, is a quiet, dusty town, whose broad streets are decorated with bright red flamboyant trees and clumps of purple flowers. At the Keys Hotel, an elderly Tanzanian, whose manner suggested he had served in an earlier, colonial period, escorted me at a snail's pace up the solid wooden steps and into my room on the second floor. The open windows meant I could hear the raucous cacophony of the staff doing laundry and preparing food in the courtyard down below. I closed the windows and switched on the huge ceiling fan, but its rusty blades whirred and roared like those of a helicopter so I instantly turned it off. Some years earlier I had stayed in a room with a glorious view of the snow-capped peak. Back then I only had to incline my head to see what Hemingway meant when he described the mountain as \"wide as the whole world, great, high and unbelievably white in the sun\". Today, I was swatting mosquitoes and listening to the discordant clatter of pots and pans. Eventually I went down to the restaurant for dinner and William, the head waiter, asked me where my \"Babu\" (grandfather in Swahili) friend was. I said he would soon be down. William looked knowingly; \"I will pray for you both,\" he said. The Machame route is reputedly the most beautiful, but it is difficult. According to the official literature, no crampons, axes or ropes are necessary, but good boots, huge determination, a knowledgeable guide, and a willing and able group of porters are all vital. The first day's climbing involves trudging uphill through the rainforest, the grey-green streamers of bearded lichen that decorate the trees rendering the whole scene ghostly. As we walked beneath the thick canopy, the silence was broken only by the shrieking roar of the black and white Colobus monkeys that were careful to stay out of sight, and Russell confirming that his knee was holding up. I looked around and marvelled at the fabulously twisted moss and fern-encrusted juniper trees, and then the sky began to weep gentle rain and the wind tugged a little at my T-shirt. Eventually, at 9,776 ft, we burst clear of the rainforest and began to trip across a heather-clad moor, complete with drifting mist, in a landscape that was so reminiscent of the Scottish highlands that I half-expected to discover a kilted bagpiper around the corner. Eventually we made camp and, as the porters began to pitch the tents and saunter off in search of fresh stream water, our guide, Arnold, approached and told my partner that tomorrow he should slow down. Arnold could have saved his words for Russell's knee was now giving him trouble, and he had already taken two painkillers. As we squatted in the cold Russell began to talk ominously of a knee brace. In the morning we set off for Shira Camp (12,598 ft) knowing that our day would begin with a challenging uphill walk of about four-and-a-half hours. And then the skies began to release a light rain, which soon stiffened into a downpour. As we trudged along, Russell declared: \"Climbing Kili is the only thing left in the world that reminds me of my first writing in that I'm doing it for myself and it makes no sense to anybody else.\" I thought about Russell's words, but on this bleak windswept day, bent double into the wind, and shivering with cold, it was difficult to concentrate. By 6pm it was getting dark and it had not stopped raining. I sat in the entrance to my tent and peered through the gloom at the huge white-necked ravens that hopped all around scavenging for hand-outs. Night had paused on the horizon and was simply waiting for the light to leave. Only then would the stars present themselves and night come hurrying towards us. I thought of the day's climb and realised that I wasn't sure why I had spent the past few hours clinging to icy rock in the driving rain, and tip-toeing along narrow ledges with sheer drops of up to 200 ft to one side. When I first started to write it didn't matter to me what other people thought, the fact was, writing made sense to me. Clearly, for Russell, the selfish determination that was informing this ascent reminded him of his own writing, but I couldn't help feeling that our present predicament in the teeming rain suggested perverse willfulness as opposed to admirable dedication. That night I lay huddled in my sleeping bag, the wind howling all around, listening to Russell turning and tossing in his tent. The first two times I climbed Kilimanjaro, I did so alone and essentially to see if I could do it. The third time I did so to accompany a friend. But this ascent truly made no sense. I could talk to Russell about books at sea-level in any number of restaurants in London or New York. Were we really so vain that once we had declared our intent in a bar in Saratoga Springs we felt obliged to follow through? I woke up at 1.30am and reached for my torch. I could see my breath clouding, like that of a horse that has just won the Grand National, but at least the sound of slashing rain had stopped. Everything in the tent was wet: my bags, my books, and my clothes. Only my body, shivering inside the sleeping bag that was perched on a half-inch foam mattress, remained relatively dry. Water had seeped up through the groundsheet and this thin mattress was now functioning as a raft. The need to use the open-air \"toilet\" meant I had to abandon the safety of my raft and pull on my boots. Once outside I could see that the wide sky looked as though somebody had taken a silver paintbrush and wiped it back and forth. Every available space was speckled with stars. Standing ankle deep in mud, the cold cutting right through to my bones, I noticed that chunks of ice had formed on the outside of the tent and I began to cough. At nearly 5pm on the third day, Russell and I arrived at the Barranco Camp (12,959 ft), exhausted and somewhat worried. The Barranco valley is celebrated for its teeming waterfalls, spectacular vegetation and abundant wildlife, but for most of the day visibility had been severely limited. There had been tantalising glimpses of the snow-capped summit, and occasionally I could see the long grass, the drooping boughs, and the unmanicured charm of the rugged valley, but the bigger problem was that I could now distinctly feel the lack of oxygen. For the first time I began to worry about AMS and I was closely monitoring my body for signs of nausea or lack of appetite. I remembered the crushing headaches and hallucinations that had plagued me in the past, and I kept reminding myself that the only way up this mountain is \"pole, pole\", which in Swahili means \"slowly, slowly\". Sadly, each year AMS contributes to the deaths of a handful of climbers on Kilimanjaro. The following lunchtime my headache seemed to have taken up permanent residence and Russell was clearly suffering with his knee. The clouds had lifted and in the distance I could see a flat parched earth that was decorated with tufts of green bush that looked like decorative sprigs of mint. The heath and moorland had eventually given way to this highland desert, a barren terrain of strong winds, thin air, and little bird or mammal life. Gone were the lumpish green hills and the valleys decorated with short, stumpy trees. Up here in the desert, I was no longer looking for kilted bagpipers, I was looking for camel trains. The previous days had seen us pass through three distinct climatic zones; equatorial, then moorland, and now desert. However, up ahead lay the arctic. After two hours of fitful sleep at the Barafu Camp (14,927 ft) I woke up at 8pm with a vicious stabbing pain in my stomach which I immediately knew to be the evening's stew impatiently re-announcing itself. I lay curled on my side, the howling wind beating the tent like a ragged sail, and I had the distinct feeling that at any moment the flimsy edifice would be ripped from its moorings. At 11pm precisely, a porter appeared with tea and biscuits, and I forced down a few mouthfuls of tea and then listened as he smiled and said, \"Hopefully you'll summit at dawn.\" Having introduced me to a new verb, he disappeared, and I stepped out into the bone-chilling night air and looked all around. Russell staggered out of his tent. \"What did we eat?\" So it was not my imagination; on top of everything else, we were now suffering from food poisoning. Other groups of climbers were already on their way to the summit, looking like a long line of coalminers with their lamps strapped neatly to their heads. I took up my place behind the guide, and in front of a visibly limping Russell, and began to breathe deeply as we stepped forward and began the long, arduous nighttime ascent. However, no matter how deeply I breathed it seemed to be impossible for me to get enough oxygen into my lungs and as a result my legs felt weak and unresponsive. I could hear Russell's footsteps behind me, and I tried to ignore the stabbing pains in my stomach and concentrate instead on the light from my headlamp that was shining on the back of the guide's woollen cap. After three hours of climbing in the freezing dark I finally admitted to myself that I could see two black cats who were walking ahead of me. Then the cats suddenly transformed themselves into two dancing hobgoblins, and then a rock began to speak directly to me and gave me the GNER timetable for trains leaving London King's Cross. At about 18,000 ft I heard a horse neigh loudly, but there was no sign of a horse, and then I saw four men draped in white, carrying a white coffin, floating down the mountain towards me. I decided it was best not to mention any of my observations to Russell, whose indigestion system was now operating at full throttle, and whose breath had become worryingly short and laboured. Some time later the batteries on Russell's headlamp gave out and he signalled to Arnold that he would have to stop and change them. I was relieved, and seized this opportunity to sit heavily on a rock, directly under Orion the Hunter. In fact, I felt so close to the constellation that I was sure I could reach up and pluck it out of the sky. And then I foolishly fell asleep. This is a place where if one sleeps for 15 minutes, there is a very strong possibility of not waking up. When I heard Arnold say \"Ready\", I snapped my head to attention and pretended I had not fallen asleep at all. And then, as we began to move off, the hallucinations began again, but this time I kept my eyes trained on my feet and mercifully all I saw were imaginary bright red flowers against the frozen scree. As we inched our way towards Stella Point on the lip of the crater, I felt too physically weak to lift my head and look either left or right. I was also wary of listening or looking too closely at anything in case the rocks started to talk to me again or in case I saw those damn hobgoblins. Then, just as I thought this torture would never end, the sun began to rise on the horizon behind us and light quickly flooded the sky. The heavens turned from a silver-speckled black to the deepest blue, and away in the east the gentle curvature of the Earth was clearly discernible. Immediately I scrabbled in my pockets and pulled out my sunglasses, for the light reflecting against the snow and glacial ice was blinding. Then, towering above me I saw the huge peak that was now within striking distance. The climb from Stella Point to Uhuru Peak was physically less demanding than the punishing six-hour ascent in the dark. As Russell and I edged our way along the narrow ridge, the sight of the snow-crusted volcanic crater to one side, and the wide glacial sea of the southern icefield to the other, was stunning. Forty-five minutes later we reached Uhuru Peak where a neat wooden sign informed us that we had now reached the highest point in Africa. Russell and I high-fived each other. \"Here's to the Parting Glass in Saratoga Springs,\" he said. Then we both looked around at this most amazing sight. To be walking in the sky and see the sun rise over Africa is a precious gift. I contemplated the moment, but our shivering guide seemed keen that we should begin our descent. As we turned and began to walk away from Uhuru Peak, a newly ebullient Russell suggested that we climb together next in Ecuador. It was nearly 10am when we finally returned to the Barafu Camp. I was tired and hungry, for the three-and-a-half hour descent had been difficult. Skiing down the scree had provided me with the opportunity to do a reasonable impression of a two-legged Bambi, but it soon became clear that Russell's knee was giving him some serious problems, as was his right foot. After some soup, Arnold insisted that we start yet another five-hour descent across a nondescript volcanic rock landscape that looked almost lunar, and try to make our final camp before sunset. After six hours we eventually limped into Mweka Camp, with Russell in considerable pain and needing not only to sit, but soak his injured foot in a bowl of water. At five the following morning, the excited babble of porters, eager to return to friends and family, preceded the dawn chorus of birds. The Kilimanjaro wake-up call is a tinny blaring of porters' radios, cut with the incessant scraping and banging of pots and pans, and the tented noises of snoring and the rustling of plastic bags. After breakfast, we set off through the dense vegetation of the rainforest, but Russell continued to walk slowly, for his knee and foot were still giving him problems. However, the song of the birds and the howling of the monkeys, and the occasional flash of light that managed to penetrate the undergrowth, all seemed comforting after the arid terrain of the summit. \"I feel like I'm over the slog of the American book tour,\" said Russell as he took a break and leaned against a tree. The sun caught the diamond stud in his ear, and suddenly the side of his face lit up. \"Climbing Kili has got me back again.\" I looked at the rainforest surrounding us. More than a week had passed without either of us having seen a house, a car, a television set, a newspaper, or another person who was simply going about their daily life. We walked on, but it was only when I saw the tracks where the four-wheel drive vehicles had passed that I truly understood that my re-entry into the \"real\" world was almost complete. At the gate we signed the book and received our certificates, which confirmed that we had \"summitted\". As we did so, Russell scanned the pages to find out if, at 64, he was the oldest man to reach the top in the past few months. On discovering a 68-year-old German only a week or so earlier, he laughed and shut the book. I watched his mind drift towards thoughts of Cuban cigars and doubles of whisky. My own mind drifted back to questions of what all of this had meant. Russell and I had not really talked about Africa, or about writing, or about race, which constituted the usual roster of subjects we kicked around whenever we met. Most of the time we were simply too exhausted to talk. I was happy for Russell that the climb had revived his spirits after his American publication, but for me it had been a lesson in understanding obsession. After my three previous ascents I had learned to face down the question, \"Why do you do this?\" with the same blank stare that I gave people who, many years ago, would ask me, \"Why do you want to write?\" It is difficult to explain obsession. However, on this particular ascent I rapidly discovered that there was no correlation between the selfish preoccupation of climbing Kilimanjaro and my writing. For the first time there was no obsession to alleviate the frustration of the task that lay ahead, and I very quickly found myself surrendering to the illogicality and pain of the journey. In response to \"Why do you do this?\" I would now have to shrug my shoulders and say, \"I don't know\" and really, that's not a good enough answer, either for climbing Kilimanjaro or for writing. A little obsession can go a long way towards assuaging hardship. Once we reached the Keys Hotel it was with a sense of relief that I offered my sleeping bag to Arnold. There would be no more Kilimanjaro ascents for me. The following morning, while Russell slept, I took a beaten-up Peugeot into Moshi to try to find an internet caf\u00e9. The young, moon-faced boy of a driver was unsurprisingly proud of his third-hand vehicle with blacked-out windows. I found a caf\u00e9, but I could only receive and not send emails and so I quickly left. As we made our way back to the hotel, the clouds parted and suddenly there was a spectacular view of snow-capped Kilimanjaro hovering right above the town. The driver pointed. \"Kili,\" he said. \"Only crazy people go up there. It is too cold for us.\" I asked him what was up there. He laughed and then slapped a thigh as he drove. \"Nothing,\" he said. It was the best joke he had heard in years. \"They climb all that way and there's nothing there. No fruits to pick, no crops, no animals. Nothing.\" \u00a9 Caryl Phillips"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
