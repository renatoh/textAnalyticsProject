Nerves almost got the best of Kim in the short program, and her 0.28-point lead over the 17-year-old Russian Adelina Sotnikov is almost as slim as it could get. Sotnikov\u2019s snappy routine had the crowd on its feet before she finished her final spin, but Kim showed she is still the favorite to win another title. Italy\u2019s Carolina Kostner, whose Ave Maria program is almost a religious experience for her, was just behind. Chicago\u2019s Gracie Gold was fourth, within striking distance after overcoming a sense of stage fright. Lipnitskaia, who won both programs in the team event to help the hosts take the gold, broke down in tears after her routine was marred by the fall. \u201cThis does not define her career or who she is as an athlete,\u201d coach Eteri Tutberidze said through a translator. \u201cShe simply made a mistake. That\u2019s all. It happens.\u201d When it happened, the crowd was stunned. And Kim had the lead, but barely, over Sotnikova. Lipnitskaya falters Winning routine Strong showing for US US champion Gracie Gold, second to Lipnitskaia in the team free skate, had a clean short program to sneak in ahead of Lipnitskaia by 3.4 points. \u201cTo be able to come up here and feel stiff and white as a ghost but stare fear in the face is what I\u2019m all about now,\u201d the 18-year-old Gold said. Ashley Wagner of Alexandria, Virginia, and Polina Edmunds of San Jose, California, were sixth and seventh \u2014 a very strong showing for the United States. Should she hang on to first place on Friday, Kim, 23, would become the third woman to win consecutive Olympics, following Sonja Henie and Katarina Witt. She acknowledged her nerves on Wednesday. \u201cI am a human being,\u201d she said. \u201cI get nervous all the time. It just doesn\u2019t show on my face.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
