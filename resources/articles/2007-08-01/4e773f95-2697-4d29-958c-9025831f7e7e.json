Having repeatedly been told the new prime minister would be useless, voters are pleased to find that he isn't. As the Guardian explains today, he has also been hoarding lots of spending announcements. But Sunday's 10-point lead in the polls isn't a good enough reason to call an election any time soon. The public mood can change as quickly as a hedge fund manager's confidence. One day you're the admired man in charge, the next you're a workaholic who won't even take time off in August. The allegation surfaced last night. Mr Brown knows that too. Boundary changes may cost him 20 seats before a vote is cast. The Tories are awash with money whereas Labour has suffered a donor drought during the loans for honours inquiry. Even an election in May 2008 would stretch the party. Bad luck or a slip would deliver a hung parliament on a swing of barely 1.5%. No harm in letting election speculation run to unite your own side, raise cash, unsettle the Tories still further, provided it doesn't get out of hand. Jim Callaghan famously let that happen in the summer of 1978. When he finally said no to an October election voters were annoyed. After a winter of industrial strife Margaret Thatcher won. In fact, the last premier to pull off an early election, one less than around four years after the last, was Harold Wilson, whom voters rewarded with a 98-seat majority in 1966, just 18 months after he scraped in by just four. Ted Heath, who unexpectedly beat him when Wilson gambled on a Brown-ish poll blip in 1970, lost in early 1974. Wilson failed to win a working majority when he tried again that October. Voters were more deferential in the disciplined 1950s. Anthony Eden, who took over from Winston Churchill after an even longer wait than Brown's in 1955, won his snap election. Much good it did him: the Suez debacle was barely a year away. Still, the chance to remove David Cameron's grin is clearly tempting many Labour MPs and ministers. John Redwood's rightwing cuts package is being attacked on rightwing websites: who knows when a better chance will come? It still won't happen. Why so? The global financial wobble is one reason. It is hard to blame Whitehall for bombs, floods or foot and mouth disease, but if financial markets head south, taking housing and pensions with them, people may say \"wasn't he in charge of the money?\" or \"is there worse to come?\" It takes more time and testing than Mr Brown has had to rebuild trust. There are also practical reasons. Lord Ashcroft's millions are being poured into targeted Labour marginals with no deal in sight to cap party funding and spending. And Scotland's first minister, canny Alex Salmond, will today raise the strategic stakes with his independence white paper. It will make No 10's Mr Caution even more cautious."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
