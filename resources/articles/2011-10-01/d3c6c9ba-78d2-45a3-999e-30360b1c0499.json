Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, EC president, indicated that he would put forward proposals on Wednesday for propping up banks as part of a wider scheme to resolve the sovereign debt crisis through greater economic integration. He will also propose further strengthening the main bailout find, the European financial stability facility (EFSF). Barroso's upbeat comments on Tuesday came hours after Jean-Claude Trichet, outgoing European Central Bank (ECB) president, warned that the continent's financial crisis had become \"systemic\" and demanded swift action to prevent such dramas recurring. The sense of urgency within Europe's policymaking elite was underlined by reports that the European Banking Authority (EBA), based in London, is said to be pressing banks to achieve a core capital ratio of at least 7% in a new round of stress tests. This, according to Reuters, would require 48 banks to raise \u20ac99bn (\u00a387bn) in fresh capital. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said European banks require \u20ac200bn. The fact that Dexia, the Franco-Belgian bank that was broken up and finally bailed out on Monday, passed EBA tests only this summer has brought to a head calls for a more stringent examination of the sector. Credit rating agency Fitch added to the pressure by downgrading six Spanish banks including Santander, which has a major presence in the UK. It said Spain's low economic growth, high unemployment rate and weak property sector meant its banks were a higher credit risk. Rival agency Standard &amp; Poor's also warned that Spain's banks are now riskier, citing \"turbulence in the capital markets\" as well as Spain's meagre growth prospects and its troubled real estate market. Confounding the doomsayers, the euro rose last night in New York to a high for the month of $1.3651 after the IMF, European Union and ECB \"troika\" told the Greek government it could expect to get the latest \u20ac8bn tranche of bailout funds early next month. But they told the Greeks to prepare for even deeper austerity, including further cuts in wages/salaries, pensions and jobs, in order to meet tougher fiscal targets in 2012. With senior EC officials sanguine about the eventual outcome of the Slovak vote on enhanced powers for the EFSF, Barroso intends to steal the thunder of German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, with his own plan for weak banks, a bigger bailout fund and eurozone economic governance as a whole. The EU set itself a deadline of 23 October, when the next summit takes place, for adopting the \"comprehensive\" plan agreed by Merkel and Sarkozy when they met in Berlin on Sunday, although they gave no details. Barroso has had to force warring factions within his 27-strong commission to bury the hatchet before he can present his plan to the European parliament on Wednesday. Michel Barnier, internal market commissioner, who had stuck to the Sarkozy line that the banks should be given fresh capital via the EFSF and not by governments or capital markets, was bluntly told to represent all of Europe, not just France. The warnings came not only from Barroso but from Olli Rehn, economic and financial affairs commissioner, and his predecessor, now at competition, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. Barroso indicated after talks with the Dutch premier Mark Rutte in The Hague that Rehn would get a bigger role in policing eurozone countries' budget deficits and imposing sanctions under his wider governance plan. \"We need stronger governance; we need more discipline. We need integration and discipline,\" he said. Earlier, speaking as chairman of the European systemic risk board, an EU body overseeing the financial system, Trichet told MEPs: \"The high interconnectedness in the EU financial system has led to a rapidly rising risk of significant contagion. It threatens financial stability in the EU as a whole and adversely impacts the real economy in Europe and beyond.\" With G20 finance ministers meeting this weekend and certain to demand swift moves by the EU to end the crisis, Trichet said it was \"absolutely fundamental\" to restore the credibility of sovereign debt to prevent new dramas. Days after the Franco-Belgian bank Dexia was broken up and bailed out and two small banks in Denmark and Greece asked governments for help, the ECB's emergency lending facility has been giving some banks up to \u20ac3bn a day at penal rates. Banks could also undergo further stress after the eurozone chairman, Jean-Claude Juncker, was quoted on the Austrian state broadcaster ORF as saying that the voluntary 21% \"haircut\" they face for helping to bail out Greece could leap to as much as 50%-60% in the event of a default."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
