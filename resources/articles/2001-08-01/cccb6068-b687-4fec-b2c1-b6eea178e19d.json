Emerging blinky-eyed from years of AS-levels and modular degree courses, do they humbly doff their caps to their elders and settle down gratefully into the nearest Starbucks job? No, they don't. Instead, it seems, they wander around having a \"quarter-life crisis\": a sense of helplessness, confusion and indirection in the face of nasty, unmeritocratic real life. They're too idealistic and get depressed. But because twentysomethings are assumed to be living the best years of their lives, no one cares, and so no one warns the next batch about the existential gloom they'll inherit. Except the authors of this book, who have interviewed many sufferers in order to diagnose the syndrome's contributory factors: the \"what now?\" feeling, the unwillingness to assume adult responsibility, the self-doubt, the dissatisfaction with being defined by your McJob. As evidenced here, the quarter-life crisis is a mixture of pathetic whingeing (cleaning his own bathroom and feeding himself comes as a real shock for one law graduate) and the kind of justified indignation against the world that used to be beaten out of the young much earlier. It seems that the more widely educated young people become, the more dissatisfied they are. There might be hope for us all yet. Musical Constructions of Nationalism eds Harry White and Michael Murphy (Cork, \u00a316.95) The \"new musicology\", as you will be aware, is an interdisciplinary, materialist approach to music criticism, in which to \"abstract\" the music from its political and cultural context is the cardinal sin. As in all such methodological spats, if you go too far the other way you also become raving mad. Fortunately this collection of essays on 20th-century music is not as programmatic as all that, though it is infected with a low-level jargon virus. There is a thoughtful analysis of Bartok's use of folk song (if you can forgive such sentences as \"Bartok's position vis-\u00e0-vis peasant music presents an almost Derridean deconstruction of that of Liszt\"), a fine glance at the reception of Wagner among 20th-century audiences, and surveys of Italian music and Scottish song. Best is Daniel Grimley's \"Horn Calls and Flattened Sevenths\", a close analysis of Nielsen and the \"Danish style\" - its elemental structures of Nordic purity, its snow-capped horns stacked in fifths, and so on. Grimley rightly insists that new musicology can only go so far without recourse to the idea of \"musical signification\". Stories of the Invisible Philip Ball (Oxford, \u00a311.99) Scientists in different disciplines are always jostling for status. Now Ball's short \"guided tour of molecules\" aims to prove, with a minimum of those confusing linked-ball diagrams, that the historically downtrodden and frumpy breed of chemists are cleverer and more beddable than mathematicians, biologists and physicists put together. Chemistry is the new black. Look: you can find out how cells work; you can make nanotechnology (ridiculously tiny machines with molecules for their moving parts); you can blow stuff up in really cool ways; you can even build a chemical computer. (Physicists will retort, of course, that quantum computers will be even better.) Ball writes with some elegance, although the scattershot nature of this brief survey means that some passages are over-dense - you sometimes feel that you're snacking on bits of impressive ideas rather than being led to understand them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
