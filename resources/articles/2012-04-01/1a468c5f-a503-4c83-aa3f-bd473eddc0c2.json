David Cameron took even less time to \"go international\", and the heart sinks to hear him lecturing about Islam and democracy in the way that Blair did. Cameron's head-patting of Indonesia, as a state that \"gets it right\" is clearly directed at a western, not a Muslim, audience. He should think hard, though, about the effect his words may have on the people he is most concerned about discouraging \u2013 extremists, for whom western approval is a sign of decadence. Indonesia's success, and the choices its people make, have nothing to do with Cameron. He may wish to be burnished by association. For Indonesia though, there's a danger that his enthusiastic endorsement will be viewed in dangerous quarters as a smear and a taint."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
