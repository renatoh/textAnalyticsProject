He spoke as one who has visited more drawing boards than Sir Norman Foster and knows a carbuncle when he sees one. He had just seen a drawing-room performance, leisurely, tired, perhaps complacent, far removed from the heat and industry of the kitchen and lively relish of the dining-room as displayed by Fulham. The visitors even came with their own seating plan, sticking two of their midfield five in defensive roles. The hosts hardly got a sniff, let alone a bite. Glenn Hoddle likewise \"did not smell that performance coming. It makes you scratch your head.\" Fans, witnessing their fourth home defeat in five games, were more likely tearing their hair out. Hoddle went for the weary explanation. \"We were a yard or two short and looked fatigued. Some of our players did not have much of a pre-season.\" Perhaps they had over-reached themselves. Perhaps the season is too long. This was their third game in eight days where Fulham had enjoyed a free week. \"We were leggy.\" This at least was true. Spurs, untypically, topped the charts for fouls and yellow cards, as well as shots off target and inside-leg measurement. Fulham were glad of Zat Knight's 6ft 6in to counter the corner threat of Dean Richards, Ledley King and Anthony Gardner reinforcing Freddie Kanout\u00e9 and Bobby Zamora. And he attacked the ball. There was no lounging in Fulham colours. It was this that perturbed Hoddle. \"What disappointed me was that we didn't try to churn out a win. We didn't have it in us. The car was in neutral with no one to put it in drive.\" Clearly Hoddle is an automatic man. How long he will be allowed to find a gear is anyone's guess but he was let down by his team as Fulham gained their first win at Spurs since 1948. The previously influential Jamie Redknapp influenced nothing, the wing-backs got little meaningful into the middle and Hoddle was fair to exonerate the front men, whether two or, as in the second half, three when he switched from 3-5-2 to 4-3-3, on grounds of lack of service. Rotation of strikers seemed to mean running in circles. Hoddle was in no mood to follow them. \"It is up to me and the players to get to the core of it. We're a side that's still developing.\" After 2 years the feeling grows of \"once a caterpillar, always a caterpillar\". But he is looking now to St\u00e9phane Dalmat of Internazionale to come in on loan and turn them into a butterfly from midfield. Spurs' back three of choice, vaunted after their first two games in harness, were humbled by Fulham's energy and ingenuity, founded on a shape that Chris Coleman called \"more rigid, more organised\" than at Everton the previous week. A jellyfish would have been more shapely than that. \"When they had the ball, we had 10 behind it. When we got it, we played.\" Unlike Hoddle, Coleman had concentrated on working with what he had, while not denying the possibility of a signing before 5pm today. His team will have reduced his fury at the volte-face by Claudio Reyna, who had even posed with a Fulham shirt. And Barry Hayles' performance, alone up front, may have made Coleman see the loss of the expensive mistake Steve Marlet as a blessing. Hayles, a carpenter before a Cottager, is no Thierry Henry but he had Spurs' back three treading on nails with his speed and burly zest. \"He's come up the hard way,\" said Coleman, \"through non-league and he messed Tottenham about.\" Early on he had to wait for support. For the first of his two goals, bursting on to Lee Clark's overhead surprise from halfway, he could wait no longer, beat two of Spurs' three and shot home. The second followed howlers by Darren Anderton and Richards, who was again at fault in letting him cross for Fulham's third. Clark and Louis Saha should have made it five. Spurs go to Chelsea next. How many drawing boards, and how often, add up to a sack? Man of the match: Barry Hayles (Fulham)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
