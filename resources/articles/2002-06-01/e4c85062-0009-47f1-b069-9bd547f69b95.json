He believes that the US Open, which starts at this Long Island course on Thursday, will see the creation of a new and more civilised society, at least as far as he is concerned. The reason? The issuing of 25,000 badges, free to any spectator who wants one, by the US magazine Golf Digest which say simply: \"Be Nice To Monty\". Montgomerie himself is so sold on the idea that he has obtained 25, told his caddie Andy Prodger to wear one on either side of his baseball cap, and distributed the remainder to family and friends. It will mean, he hopes, an end to being called \"you fat bastard\"; an end to being labelled \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and a cessation of all references to the Ryder Cup and Europe's loss in that competition last time. Some hope. What he seems to have forgotten is that this is New York, a city that glories in having the rudest fans in world sport. This is the state that, the last time the US Open was held in it, needled Greg Norman so badly he went to the spectator who had dared to call him a choker, took him by the throat and almost lifted him off his feet. There was not time to continue there and then but the spectator wisely did not accept an offer to see Norman in the car park afterwards. A New York crowd is Millwall magnified. A columnist on Newsday, Johnette Howard, summed up the chances of a simple badge having any positive effect. \"Poor Monty,\" she sighed, \"poor, poor Monty.\" She went on: \"You want to shake Montgomerie by the shoulders and shout 'You poor delusional lamb. Wake up.' A New York sports fan,\" she added, \"will boo his own mother if she burns the breakfast toast.\" There are already signs that there will be a \"button backlash\". One fan with the badge pinned to his shirt found the catcalls being directed at him for having the temerity to wear the badge in the first place. Greg Webb, a chef, said: \"People are heckling me for wearing it. I've had at least 10 people say to me: 'C'mon, he should be able to take it.' New York,\" he added, \"is built on contentiousness.\" But if Monty finds he has got problems, what about poor old Tiger? It seems Woods has no chance this week; nought, zero, zilch. The authorities for this are none other than the president of the Organisation for Professional Astrology, Arlan Wise, who is backed up by The Amazing Kreskin, a \"Las Vegas mentalist and thought reader\". What they are saying, in USA Today, is that though Woods may be a preternaturally good golfer, he cannot combat the supernatural. This is quite something to assert, given that if Woods did manage to win this week he would be halfway to a grand slam and that by all earthly calculations he is a hotter favourite to win this major than he has been when winning the previous seven. But if it is not in the stars, what can Woods do about it? Not much according to Wise, who says that the world No1 could literally be solar eclipsed. Wise, having read his astrological chart, says: \"Woods was born on December 30 1975, which makes him a Capricorn, a sign associated with ambitious people who regularly reach their goals. But the current position of the planets affect a person's chart and Mars is very important to athletes as it determines their energy level and thus how they compete. \"Tiger has a very competitive Mars but on Monday there was a partial solar eclipse which happened very close to his Mars, so light is getting blocked, things are ending. Saturn is sitting right on his Mars, making it a very low-energy time for him when things get harder.\" If that were not enough, The Amazing Kreskin foresees complete confusion affecting the renowned concentration Woods brings to golf. \"I see a ball coming towards him as he is on the course,\" says the mentalist. \"The sun glazes around it giving it a hypnotic effect and he will then confuse the image of the ball with his girlfriend's face. \"That will then morph into her throwing a plate or saucer at him, as maybe they had a lover's feud the night before. This will shake him up and distract him so that his timing will be off at a crucial moment, so could it possibly be that love will cost him the championship?\" The remainder of the field, having found no earthly means of stopping the phenomenon that is Woods, will have to hope that Kreskin and Wise are right. If so, astrology could be big in world golf."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
