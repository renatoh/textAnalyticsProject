The third-generation designer of one of Italy\u2019s most famous fashion dynasties has been brought back into the fold to relaunch and pick up the creative-director reins of the M Missoni fashion label \u2013 and her idea for the brand? To re-purpose vintage upholstery fabrics, never-seen-before prints and retro designs from her family\u2019s near 60-year-old archive into wardrobe staples for a new generation. \u201cI researched press clips, memorabilia, colour cards, everything that had been Missoni and I realised we lost bits that are so relevant for today,\u201d says the designer, whose mother, Angela, currently designs the main Missoni line. Margherita clearly revels in the discovery process that her new position affords \u2013 discovery being the operative word. As she opens the door to her home office in Varese, an hour northwest of Milan, 15 minutes from the Missoni HQ and where the direction for this bold rebranding was birthed, it becomes clear that there\u2019s no person better suited to breathing new life into old treasures. If you\u2019re one of her 160k followers on Instagram , you\u2019ll know that Margherita is never happier than when sifting through bric-a-brac at a vintage flea market to rescue lost relics. Her office is in the house she had built two years ago with her husband, the racing-car driver Eugenio Amos, which they share with their sons Otto, six, and Augusto, four. Step into it and it is as though her eclectic account has sprung to life. \u201cThis is the one place in the house where I can really let go,\u201d she says, her face breaking into a smile as she points to and picks up mementos from the G Plan shelves she discovered on a thrifting trip to Brussels before she even knew they would fit. Against a backdrop of hand-painted floral wallpaper, they are laden with sentimental objects: photos of Margherita on stage in New York from her short-lived acting career; a painting given to her on her 20th birthday by an artist friend; figurines collected on her travels to India, Singapore and Sardinia; and porcelain baskets placed on vintage plates picked up in another time and place. It looks like a lovingly curated antique shop-cum-fashion salon and, although it is a happily haphazard mix (\u201cI don\u2019t like things that are too literal,\u201d she says), it is impeccably organised. It\u2019s a character trait that is exemplified by the tower of boxes on the adjacent wall. Covered in traditional Italian drawer-lining paper, they are home to clippings on style, travel and interiors research, wedding photographs, craft paper, beads and stationery. \u201cI love cataloguing, as it\u2019s a way to get my head straight,\u201d she says. \u201cBy organising everything I get a lot of inspiration for my home and M Missoni, because I can see everything again and again.\u201d She explains that she inherited her collector gene from her grandmother, 88-year-old Rosita Missoni, who founded and ran the family brand, Missoni, with her husband Ottavio in 1953 before passing the baton to Angela in 1997. It was with her that Margherita scoured flea markets around Europe as a child \u2013 and continues to do so. Although now she can be found burning the midnight oil scrolling through online auction sites, such as eBay, Pamono, and Catawiki. Rosita\u2019s acquisitions and influence can be felt all around her granddaughter\u2019s creative haven. There are the blinds embroidered with daisies (Margherita\u2019s adopted emblem) that are made from fabric she picked up in a flea market before they were transformed by seamstress to the stars Lilou Marquand in Paris. And there\u2019s the bright blue coffee table that once stood in Rosita\u2019s London apartment. Her influence is most obvious in the rail of coats from Margherita\u2019s new capsule collection that takes centre stage here. The collection was the first thing Margherita designed for the M Missoni label (and they were immediately snapped up by matchesfashion.com where they launch this month). They are made from patterns, original yarns and re-used fabrics that Rosita herself would have manufactured. It is the most tangible example of how symbiotic Margherita\u2019s new job is. \u201cThere was always something in me that thought I might do this \u2013 I know my grandma was desperate for me to [work in the family business] when I wasn\u2019t,\u201d says Margherita, who ran several successful fashion lines independently, before she was asked to relaunch M Missoni last year. \u201cWhen I was 18 I moved away to do something different and find out who I was, because I felt like a branch on a tree, not an individual. But then I realised that fashion is what is most immediate for me. It\u2019s what I do best and I saw that I could strengthen Missoni as a company through this brand by adding a new layer in this way.\u201d As with her penchant for collecting and cataloguing rare finds, the new brand gives her the same satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019m much happier when I have to work within a constraint. I like to collect and find things and then use them.\u201d Her personal style is as instinctive as her surroundings. \u201cDressing is totally a way of expression for me,\u201d she says, pointing to the giant Catherine Walker oil painting that hangs behind her desk and depicts three women sitting side-by-side on a bench wearing exactly the same thing. \u201cI really look forward to the moment I have a uniform and I dress the same everyday. I envy people who have a very strict aesthetic conviction,\u201d she says, before mischievously adding: \u201cI don\u2019t yet. I\u2019m too curious still.\u201d And so the legacy lives on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
