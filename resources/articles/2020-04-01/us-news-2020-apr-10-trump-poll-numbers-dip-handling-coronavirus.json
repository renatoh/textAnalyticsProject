Trump experienced an upturn in public support as the virus hit the US, and his job approval rating surged to almost the highest rating since he was elected. As concerns over the government\u2019s response have grown, however, the number of people who believe the president is doing a good job appears to be settling back to pre-coronavirus levels. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week found approval of Trump\u2019s handling of Covid-19 had dipped to 42%, down from 48% the week before. Trump\u2019s overall approval rating was at 40%, close to where it has been for much of his presidency. According to a survey by CNN, 45% of Americans approve of Trump\u2019s coronavirus response. Perhaps more worrying for Trump are his dwindling numbers in a match-up against Joe Biden. CNN found that Biden leads Trump 53% to 42% among registered voters nationwide. A number of Trump\u2019s advisers and Republican allies are said to be among those unimpressed with his performance at his press briefings, which have become a daily ritual and often last several hours. Axios and the New York Times reported that a series of senior figures have become dismayed at the briefings, which Trump has used to propagate lies and disinformation about his response to the pandemic. \u201cWhite House allies and Republican lawmakers increasingly believe the briefings are hurting the president more than helping him,\u201d the Times reported. Even the Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham is among those who wants Trump to rein in his briefings, which frequently run on for more than an hour and regularly feature an upset president lashing out at the press. Graham told the New York Times that Trump \u201csometimes drowns out his own message\u201d, and said he had counseled the president to limit the briefings to once a week. Axios reported that Republicans are worried the rambling performances, along with the White House\u2019s wider response to the coronavirus, could harm Trump\u2019s re-election chances. \u201cThe next 4-8 weeks is really going to decide whether Trump gets re-elected,\u201d Stephen Moore, a former Trump nominee for Federal Reserve, told Axios. The normally forgiving editorial board of the conservative Wall Street Journal has also come out against Trump\u2019s daily presentations. \u201cThe briefings began as a good idea to educate the public about the dangers of the virus, how Americans should change their behavior, and what the government is doing to combat it,\u201d the Journal wrote. \u201cBut sometime in the last three weeks Mr Trump seems to have concluded that the briefings could be a showcase for him.\u201d Despite the pleas, it seems unlikely that Trump, who is increasingly using the briefings to push out the kind of messaging usually reserved for his campaign rallies, will put a halt to them any time soon. \u201cAny suggestion that President Trump is struggling on tone or message is completely false,\u201d the White House spokesman Judd Deere told the New York Times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
