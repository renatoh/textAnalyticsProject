The location could not be more apt. It stands a short walk from the border of the Earls Court Project, the worst of the capital\u2019s big regenerations. Olympia is owned by a wing of Capital and Counties (Capco), the project\u2019s developer. Boris Johnson has opened the MIPIM proceedings. This too is fitting, as he has hailed the Earls Court scheme as a \u201clandmark\u201d. It is certainly a beacon for the mayor\u2019s subservience to the sharp operators of the real estate trade. It\u2019s recently emerged that Johnson waved through outline plans for the bulk of the Earls Court scheme despite a report he\u2019d co-commissioned questioning Capco\u2019s case for providing an unusually low percentage of affordable housing. The so-called \u201cre-imagining\u201d of the area involves the demolition of the world famous Earls Court exhibition centre, the relocation of London Underground\u2019s Lillie Bridge depot and the destruction of 760 homes. Capco is required to replace these homes with equivalent new ones, but just 740 of the other 6820 dwellings proposed for the redevelopment as a whole - less than 11% - would be defined as \u201caffordable\u201d, and none of these would be for social rent. The report, authored by the government\u2019s district valuer service (DVS), takes issue with the calculations provided by Capco - its viability assessment - on the grounds that they were done in a way likely to have underestimated future profits from the scheme. The higher a housing development\u2019s projected profits, the higher the amount of affordable homes a local authority might ask a developer to include in its plans in order to make them acceptable. For their part, developers argue that too high an affordable percentage would reduce their returns to a level that would make the whole scheme financially unworkable. The DVS report was jointly requested in 2011 by Johnson and the two councils, Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F) and Royal Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), whose territory the Earls Court project spans. Its remit was to test Capco\u2019s viability maths, with particular reference to affordable housing. Despite the reservations the report expressed, the two councils approved the project outline plans in autumn 2012 and Johnson, who could have demanded changes to them, instead gave them a green light in July 2013. Why? The mayor\u2019s justification, like that of the two councils, was that the DVS report endorsed Capco\u2019s assessment rather than finding fault with it. This characterisation was set out in the reports on the plans compiled by officers of the two councils and the Johnson-led Greater London Authority for the respective politicians they served. In each case the DVS report was described as confirming that Capco\u2019s methodology was \u201cacceptable\u201d. This was not, however, acceptable to the Save Earls Court campaign, which is fighting the Earls Court project on all fronts. One of its members asked Dr Richard Fordham, a viability expert who specialises in the provision of affordable homes, to have a look at the DVS report, which was only made public after an 18-month Freedom of Information battle with RBKC. Dr Fordham has produced a 44-page review of the DVS\u2019s work. It concludes that Capco used \u201cvarious devices\u201d to ensure \u201ca minimal estimate of profit\u201d, thereby fashioning an argument for the scheme including a smaller amount of affordable homes than would otherwise have been the case. Having read the 71-page DVS report three times, rather slowly - it\u2019s gripping, but not exactly Ed McBain - I see what Dr Fordham means. He writes that the report concurs with the affordable housing percentage argued for \u201conly in the context of Capco\u2019s warped valuation approach, and with various other qualifications\u201d and he sets out how the report, in fact, raises significant objections to that valuation approachthat were not taken on board by Johnson and the two councils alike. A major DVS concern is the assumption underpinning Capco\u2019s projections that it would act as the project\u2019s \u201cmaster developer\u201d. This means it would prepare individual plots of land for building on then sell these \u201cserviced sites\u201d to other developers to \u201cbuild out\u201d, rather than doing it itself. \u201cWe disagree with the approach adopted by the applicant [Capco],\u201d it says. Pointing out that Capco itself forecasts property values in the area will continuing to increase in the coming years, it remarks: \u201cStanding back from this we find it hard to comprehend why indeed the applicant or any other developer would sell the land short if they believe that residential values will grow\u201d. The report envisages that in such a climate \u201cthe master developer, as a minimum, would enter into joint venture agreements with individual developers\u201d in order to enjoy financial returns from that growth, rather than simply cashing out early. The DVS report also disagrees with Capco that its assumptions about the growth in the value of the scheme are \u201caggressive\u201d and demonstrates (through what is called \u201csensitivity analysis\u201d) that when certain baseline figures Capco used were slightly adjusted, higher predicted returns on its anticipated investment were produced. Dr Fordham is frank on the affordable percentage issue, saying that although H&amp;F and RBKC portrayed the report as supporting 11% \u201cit does not\u201d. He adds that he finds it hard to imagine that permission for the Capco project would have been granted in 2012 if the content of the DVS report had been made public at the time or been \u201cproperly understood by councillors\u201d. He describes Capco\u2019s approach, though deemed appropriate, if unusual, in the DVS report as \u201cmaking it very difficult to examine varying levels of affordable housing target\u201d and writes that his impression throughout reading it was \u201cof honest valuers trying to unravel a scheme, many of whose details were being withheld from them\u201d Capco says the DVS had \u201cfull access to all relevant Capco information\u201d. However, the DVS report itself says that a company called Quod, whose specialism in affordable housing economics was made use of by Capco, failed to provide clarifications it was asked for. It says that \u201cthe level of detail that informs the residential sales revenue and construction costs\u201d is \u201ca fundamental area of concern\u201d. There are other references in the report to details about elements of the scheme not being supplied. The DVS report also made two recommendations. One was that the scheme should be revalued at a later date, as at the time it was at a very early stage. The other was that a \u201creview mechanism\u201d be adopted in order to assess the amount of affordable housing in the scheme at intervals over the 22 years in which it would be expected to take shape. Capco opposed these ideas, the boroughs did not take them up, and Johnson did not demur. The eventual overall value of the Earls Court scheme has already been put at different levels by Capco. Publicly it has put it \u00a38b, and this figure has routinely reported for some time. However, the DVS report refers to an \u201centire scheme value\u201d in the region of \u00a312.05bn. And that was two years ago. It is no surprise that the mayor has given the Earls Court project such a comfortable ride. Not only does it occupy one of the redevelopment \u201copportunity areas\u201d in his London Plan, it has been championed by some of his closest borough allies. Fellow Conservatives have long dominated super-rich RBKC and the Capco scheme was passionately championed on the H&amp;F side of the border by Stephen Greenhalgh, the radical Tory who led the council until he became Johnson\u2019s policing deputy in June 2012. The scheme\u2019s master planner Sir Terry Farrell is a member of Johnson\u2019s design advisory group as is Richard Powell, Capco\u2019s (now former) director of planning and development who was centrally involved with working up the Earls Court plan. According to documents relating to a meeting of the Earls Court Project\u2019s principal landowners held in May, 2012, Capco, anticipating the DVS recommending a review mechanism, intended to \u201cspeak to\u201d Johnson\u2019s deputy for policy and planning Sir Edward Lister \u201cto try to remove such a requirement\u201d, fearing that it might deter investors. In May, Labour pulled off a shock win in H&amp;F and has conducted a review of the Earls Court deal in the hope of altering its housing element. Capco is said to have been \u201ccamped out\u201d at City Hall ever since the Tories\u2019 defeat. This is a complicated tale but it\u2019s moral is simple enough: some London politicians will make big property firms work harder for the fortunes they make in the capital than others. Johnson\u2019s approach, in line with government policy and his own ideological convictions, is to give them as little grief as possible in the form of \u201caffordable\u201d demands they\u2019d sooner not meet and that might inhibit their production of as many units as possible. A mayor with different priorities would seek to drive harder bargains and take a more critical view of developers\u2019 assessments of the viability of their own schemes - perhaps especially when a report he or she had asked for had suggested it. There are always balances to be struck. Johnson leans towards the developers\u2019 side of the scales. I asked City Hall for comment. A quote from Sir Edward was supplied which closely echoed lines long-familiar from Greenhalgh and other H&amp;F Tories over the years: the Earls Court project is a \u201conce in a lifetime opportunity\u201d, will deliver \u201cmuch-needed\u201d homes and includes a package of \u201ccommunity benefits\u201d from a section 106 agreement ensuing that local people gain the most. Sir Edward also said that City Hall planners \u201ccarefully scrutinised the viability appraisal for the scheme\u201d and are content that \u201cthe affordable housing quotas are the largest possible while ensuring that the scheme remains financially viable.\u201d City Hall, though, does accept that there remained differences of professional opinion about aspects of Capco\u2019s projections, notably concerning the implications of the \u201cmaster developer\u201d approach. I also asked if Sir Edward or the mayor had personally read either Capco\u2019s viability appraisal or the DVS report on it. I was told that \u201call documents, including the DVS report, were made available to both the mayor and deputy mayor\u201d at the time of the decision. \u201cMade available\u201d, of course, is not the same as \u201cread\u201d. But that\u2019s probably beside the point. Some additional material was added to this article at 09:30 on October 17, 2014. All previous coverage of the Earls Court project is here. Update, October 20, 2014 The Lyons report on housing, commissioned for Labour by Ed Miliband, contains (on page 75) the following on viability: There are substantial concerns about the way in which the viability of local plans, CIL charging schedules and sites are tested114. Evidence to the review suggested that this is compounded by the fact that there is no agreed methodology for viability assessment, which allows different parties to pick the methodology most to their advantage...Viability testing is essential and sufficient sites should be tested to inform assessments of the viability of the plan. But evidence to the review suggested that the current arrangements create a great deal of uncertainty and complexity, which works in favour of the partner with the most skilled consultants acting for it.
