Optus will take over broadcasting from August 2016 in a deal that includes digital rights for broadband and mobile. Foxtel, whose parent company is Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp, has been Australia\u2019s sole broadcaster of the EPL since 1997. Allen Lew, Optus\u2019s chief executive officer, said the move was part of a strategy towards becoming a mobile-led multimedia company. \u201cWith 930 million followers worldwide, the Premier League is one of the most sought after sports properties for content providers,\u201d Lew said. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a great win for Optus and will ensure that Aussie football fans can watch all the action from the world\u2019s most popular football league.\u201d The Australian Financial Review reported that Optus had lodged a $50m-plus bid to secure the rights to show one of the world\u2019s most valuable sporting commodities, substantially more than that offered by Foxtel and Qatar-based beIN Sports. How Optus will bring the EPL to Australian fans remains unclear, with several distribution options open to the telecommunications giant. It may choose to offer coverage as an online-only subscription package, create an entirely new viewing platform or sell on the rights to an existing broadcaster. \u201cOur goal is to make this content available to as many fans as possible but we\u2019re not going into to detail about distribution platforms at this stage,\u201d said an Optus spokesperson. \u201cWe\u2019ll have more to say about this in due course.\u201d The deal means Optus will now add football to its sporting portfolio, which already includes cricket after a sponsorship deal was struck earlier this month to be Cricket Australia\u2019s mobile streaming partner. The latest deal comes as a huge blow to Foxtel, who pride themselves on their sports coverage and have six dedicated sports channels. Fox are yet to agree to another pay-TV deal with the NRL, having been surprised by free-to-air channel Channel Nine, who snapped up live rights to the sought-after Saturday night game. It has, however, signed a deal to continue broadcasting the AFL."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
