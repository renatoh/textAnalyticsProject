Only an hour or so after Murray had warmed down from his tough three-setter against Fabio Fognini to earn a place in Friday\u2019s singles quarter-finals, he and Watson were told the Romanians Monica Niculescu and Florin Mergea had withdrawn. Mergea wants to save his energy for the men\u2019s doubles final, after he and Horia Tecau had beaten the Americans Jack Sock and Steven Johnson (Murray\u2019s opponent in Friday\u2019s singles quarter-finals). Those computations are a fair reflection of the hectic nature of Olympic tennis. The mixed doubles is really tacked on to the other disciplines, when teams and the draw are finalised after any residual mayhem in the singles has been taken into account. There was further late chaos when Rafael Nadal, through to the next rounds in singles and men\u2019s doubles, also pulled out of the mixed. His exit \u2013 after the exertions of winning in singles and men\u2019s doubles earlier in the day \u2013 left Garbine Muguruza without a partner and handed a walkover to the Czechs Radek Stepanek and Lucie Hradecka, as there were no alternates left. It is far from ideal to have an Olympic event disrupted in such a haphazard way. Murray could not have imagined he and Watson would be hurled into the draw so late, given they were two off the cut. But the withdrawal of the Serbians on Wednesday and the Romanians on Thursday changed all that. No sooner had Murray fulfilled his media obligations after beating Fognini, he was advised to get warmed up again. As for the match, the day-time wind on the expansive acreage of Centre Court had subsided, but not the intensity. On a mild night under clear skies, the British pair \u2013 who would have teamed up in London, had Murray not chosen to play with Laura Robson (going on to take silver) \u2013 clicked immediately. They kept their momentum going to win 6-3, 6-3, and will be back on court on Friday to face India. Meanwhile out on Court 4, Murray\u2019s brother, Jamie, and Jo Konta \u2013 who\u2019d not long endured the disappointment of losing to Angelique Kerber in the women\u2019s singles final \u2013 struggled against Jack Sock and Bethanie Mattek-Sands. The Americans won 6-4, 6-3."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
