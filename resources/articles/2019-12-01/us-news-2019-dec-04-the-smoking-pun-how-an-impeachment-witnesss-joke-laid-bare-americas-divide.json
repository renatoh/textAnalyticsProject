A simple play on words told us everything about the impeachment inquiry, the current mindset in Congress and the state of the nation. The witness Pamela Karlan cracked a joke that delighted liberals and infuriated conservatives. Or rather, it delighted conservatives because it gave them a talking point to whip up outrage. The afternoon session of the House judiciary committee hearing on the constitutional framework for impeachment had just begun when the Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee posed the question: \u201cWhat comparisons can we make between kings that the framers were afraid of and the president\u2019s conduct today?\u201d Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor, replied: \u201cKings could do no wrong because the king\u2019s word was law. Contrary to what President Trump has said, article two [of the constitution] does not give him the power to do anything he wants. \u201cI will give you one example that shows the difference between him and a king, which is: the constitution says there can be no titles of nobility. While the president can name his son Barron, he can\u2019t make him a baron.\u201d Jackson Lee smiled and there was laughter in the big and ornate committee room, where two carved eagles look down under the words \u201cE pluribus unum\u201d (out of many, one) and a dozen uniformed Capitol police lent an air of a courtroom drama. Karlan\u2019s point echoed Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s recent opinion, cited at Wednesday\u2019s hearing, that \u201cthe primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that presidents are not kings\u201d. But could we forgive the pun? Not when the president\u2019s son, tall but only 13 years of age, was involved. Republicans\u2019s well-oiled fury machine clicked straight into gear. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, tweeted: \u201cClassless move by a Democratic \u2018witness\u2019. Prof Karlan uses a teenage boy who has nothing to do with this joke of a hearing (and deserves privacy) as a punchline.\u201d The Trump 2020 election campaign demanded Karlan personally apologise to the president and first lady. Back in the room, the Trump loyalist Matt Gaetz expressed righteous indignation. \u201cWhen you invoke the president\u2019s son\u2019s name here, when you try to make a little joke out of referencing Barron Trump, that does not lend credibility to your argument,\u201d he told Karlan. Like Jim Jordan and Elise Stefanik in the intelligence committee hearings, Gaetz would have known that clip has plenty of potential for replays on Fox News and rightwing social media, bashing the left as vengeful and in the throes of \u201cTrump derangement syndrome\u201d. As the clock ticked past half-five, the hearing learned, with an audible gasp, that Melania Trump herself had weighed in, tweeting: \u201cA minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it.\u201d Karlan apologised. \u201cIt was wrong of me to do that,\u201d she told the hearing. \u201cI regret having said that.\u201d The division over this pun \u2013 a laugh line to some, evidence of liberal sneering to others \u2013 cut to the chase of yet another hopelessly polarised hearing. Facts mattered less than being on the winning team. It made one wonder whether Americans don\u2019t even laugh at the same jokes any more. Three of the witnesses, including Karlan, had been called by Democrats to testify that the evidence gathered regarding Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine meets the historical definition of impeachment. The other witness had been called by Republicans. Few Democratic or Republican politicians put a question to a witness from the other side. Democrats got plenty of ammunition. Representative Steve Cohen laid out an ABC \u2013 Abuse of power, Betrayal of the national interest and Corruption of elections \u2013 and asked if Trump had achieved the trifecta. \u201cYes,\u201d replied all three Democratic witnesses. Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor, said: \u201cI just want to stress that if what we\u2019re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable.\u201d But their opponents worked tirelessly to argue that their witnesses were partisan ivory tower-dwellers and therefore ignorable in this \u201csham\u201d and \u201cfarce\u201d. The Republican witness was Jonathan Turley, who was somewhat measured, opining that Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president \u201cwas anything but perfect\u201d. But the George Washington University law professor said: \u201cOne can oppose President Trump\u2019s policies or actions but still conclude that the current legal case for impeachment is not just woefully inadequate, but in some respects dangerous.\u201d There were also some structural problems for Democrats in the all-important court of public opinion. At hearings like Wednesday\u2019s, they have to take turns with Republicans, which creates an impression of equivalence: first let\u2019s put the case for the world being round, now let\u2019s hear the case that it\u2019s flat. So before some empty seats in the press and public galleries, members continued to talk past each other. For those still watching at home, the alternatives were sleep or, after the TV newsman Howard Beale in the film Network, to cry out: \u201cI\u2019m as mad as hell, and I\u2019m not going to take this any more!\u201d Turley had an answer for that too. \u201cI get it. You\u2019re mad,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president\u2019s mad. My Republican friends are mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad. And Luna\u2019s a goldendoodle, and they don\u2019t get mad. So we\u2019re all mad.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
