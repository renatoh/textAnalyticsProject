Eclipsing Weird Al Yankovic's 1980s pop pastiche, he leaves no genre unpilfered in mocking the likes of Talking Heads and Bjork with affectionate sarcasm, saving snidey smiles for the White Stripes. Whether it's the sleazy chic of United States of Whatever, or classic disco in Sugar Walkin', Lynch re-creates the mood to a tee, even inviting Ringo Star to drum on the sneering Double Fantasy-era Lennon funk of Cuz You Do. He's a bit Yoko Ono on Fake Bjork Song, but successfully mimics Ziggy Stardust's spacey whine on Fake David Bowie Song. Aside from impressions and imitations, Lynch's lyrics are carefully observed enough to be almost believable, playing with the idiosyncrasies of each style, stitching together a seamless satirical sketch show. \"I got a toaster to make a sandwich and did I mention I can rap in any language?\" he asks in Rapbot, hanging on to an old-skool bassline and a straight face."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
