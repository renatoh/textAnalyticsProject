Dr Mahedi Hasan Bhuiyan arrived in Australia on a student visa in 2011. He and Rebaka Sultana married the next year in Bangladesh and she joined him in Australia in 2013. Later that year their son, Adyan, was born at a Geelong hospital. A few months after his birth, Bhuiyan and Sultana noticed Adyan was struggling to lift up his head. Tests revealed he had a mild cerebral palsy, likely caused by a stroke shortly before or after his birth. Bhuiyan, who has a Bangladeshi degree and a South Korean masters, finished his PhD in engineering at Deakin University in 2016. He was granted a Victorian state government nomination for a permanent skilled migration visa, which would allow his family to build a life in Australia. However, because of Adyan\u2019s disability, it was rejected under Australia\u2019s strict \u201cone fails all fail\u201d visa health criteria. Bhuiyan\u2019s family appealed the rejection through the administrative appeals tribunal. Two-and-a-half years later, the AAT upheld the refusal, noting it was \u201cbound to accept\u201d the findings of Adyan\u2019s medical assessments in 2016 and 2019. The 2019 medical assessment found Adyan had a \u201cmild functional impairment\u201d which was likely permanent, and would likely require community services \u201cincluding but not limited to additional support at school\u201d. \u201cI do not have any idea why a kid having little weakness in his left hand will need special education,\u201d Bhuiyan said. \u201cAs far as I can understand, special education is required for those who are unable to attend in the mainstream schools.\u201d A separate medical assessment seen by Guardian Australia says Adyan is independently mobile and only requires a support rail to navigate steps and uneven surfaces. It notes he is very vocal, enjoys playing with a soccer ball and has developed movements to adapt around his disabilities. It does not assess cognitive function, which the report recommended prior to starting school, and does recommend continued therapy support in Australia or Bangladesh. Bhuiyan said Adyan goes to kindy every day and that the parents help him with physical therapy. \u201cHe\u2019s very good now, very good,\u201d he said. \u201cNo learning difficulties, he\u2019s going to school and learning everything and watching kids videos at home. \u201cNow he can grab things, when before he couldn\u2019t grab anything.\u201d In its ruling, the AAT said it had no discretion to take into account the contributions the family had made to Australia. The family has appealed to the immigration minister, David Coleman, as their last chance at staying in Australia. The minister\u2019s discretionary powers allow him to grant or deny a visa. He is not compelled to make a decision, or explain it. Bhuiyan is on a bridging visa E, a restricted three-month visa that allows the family to legally live in Australia while they wait for the outcome of their appeal to the minister. He works a casual job while Sultana keeps studying for the exam to have her qualifications as a doctor recognised in Australia. \u201cEvery three months my visa is extended,\u201d Bhuiyan said. \u201cThis situation is very difficult for me. My Deakin university supervisor told me he would include me on a project as soon as my visa situation is resolved.\u201d Bhuiyan said he was not worried about his future in either country but wants to stay in Australia and have his son educated here. The minister has previously granted visas to families in similar situations, including a Bhutanese family who lived in and worked in Australia for seven years who were facing deportation because their deaf son would be a \u201ccost\u201d to the taxpayer. The minister also granted a visa for a Filipina nurse working in Townsville, and her 10-year-old son whose visas were rejected because of his autism diagnosis. They arrived in Australia when he was two and he was diagnosed shortly after. In 2017, Bangladeshi doctor Nasrin Haque was given a last-minute reprieve after she was rejected for permanent settlement after eight years living and working as a GP in Australia, because of her daughter\u2019s autism. Her sister, brother and parents are all Australian citizens. The home affairs department does not comment on individual cases but has previously noted the ministerial intervention appeal is not an extension of the visa process, and all cases are decided on their merits. This article was amended on 3 November 2019 to correct that the family has appealed to the immigration minister, not the home affairs minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
