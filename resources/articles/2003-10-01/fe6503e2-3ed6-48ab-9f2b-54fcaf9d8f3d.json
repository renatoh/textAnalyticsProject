A Channel 4 racing presenter since 1986, he is also the author of 15 novels. First time you sat on a horse? Christ, it was that long ago that my milkman still did his round with a horse and cart. I used to help him out and, in return, he'd give me the reins occasionally. I also rode donkeys on the beach. Last time you fell off a horse? It can't have been too painful because I don't remember. I'll never forget falling off a horse called Golden Rapper in the 1976 Grand National, though. We were leading at Bechers Brook, second time around, his ears were pricked and he was still tanking along. Except that on landing his nose ended up about an inch from the ground. I have a picture of the moment at home. First time you got into trouble with a trainer? It was on my first morning as a 16-year-old apprentice at Fred Winter's yard. He'd asked me to muck a few horses out and I decided to take a radio down to keep myself entertained. When I turned it on the bloody thing I was looking after bolted. Suddenly there were six loose horses charging around the yard. I got my first of many bollockings. Last time you went on a diet? I'm on one at the moment and, no, it's not the Atkins. I tried every kind of diet when I was a jockey, from a slimming pill in the 1970s called Aids (if there's a name you wouldn't want to call something now, that would be it) to all sorts of other gimmicks. Eventually you realise that you just simply need to eat less. First time you realised that you were attractive to women? Fucking hell, if I'm honest I don't really think that I am - given the choice, I wouldn't want to be me. Somebody once said that they thought it was because I was a bit of rough. Last time you had an argument? It was a few weeks ago with John McCririck [the eccentric Channel 4 betting expert] about mobile phones. I say that the rules [banning jockeys using mobiles in an attempt to stop alleged corruption] are ungovernable. Surely they could just get someone else to make a call for them, so it's not really stopping anything, is it? McCririck, obviously, disagreed. First time you won a race? It was on a little horse called Multigrey at Worcester, when I was 17. I was absolutely useless. I'd struggled to make the weight and was as weak as anything. The horse just carried me round. Last good horse you sat on? Looks Like Trouble [the 2000 Gold Cup winner] is a fabulous horse. He's on the sidelines at the moment but he's a wonderfully mannered horse. You could put a seven-year-old on his back and he'd still behave himself. He'll probably be retired soon, but he is a real gentleman. First time you got drunk? I've never had a drink. I've seen enough drunk people to know that I can get through life without it. I don't mind people being drunk but when they ask you the same question three times in the space of an hour it gets a bit tedious. Most of the boys I raced against liked a drink, but I never bothered. It's nothing virtuous. I just don't like the smell. Last time a jockey asked you for advice? One or two of the jumps boys come up to me if there's anything they're not happy, or sure about. I'm always pleased to help, but I'd never go up to somebody and tell them they're doing something wrong. First car you owned? I bought a green mini 850 from one of the lads at Fred's yard. I've always been car mad. I never had a good car when I was riding but I've got a Jaguar XK8 at the moment. It's my third Jag and a bit of an old man's car really, but at least you can get two sets of golf clubs in the boot. Last good book you read? I've just finished John McEnroe's Serious, which was enjoyable. I got interested in writing when I did my autobiography, which was a lot of hard work. When I looked back at my first draft a year or so later, I realised it was absolute crap, so I had to redo it. I write about a novel a year now, which keeps me out of trouble. \u00b7 John Francome is part of the Channel 4 Racing team that will be covering Champions Day at Newmarket on 18 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
