In an interview with Tara Brown for 60 Minutes on Sunday night, Gibson, 23, claimed it was she who was the victim after her lies were exposed and her wellness empire fell apart. Looking by turns blank and confused \u2013 though hardly remorseful \u2013 Gibson failed to give coherent responses to Brown about her age and her past throughout the interview, despite being confronted with irrefutable evidence of the facts. \u201cI didn\u2019t trade in on my story or in other peoples lives,\u201d Gibson insisted. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to get away with anything.\u201d Since the Australian revealed this year that Gibson had never had cancer, and Fairfax reported she had never delivered thousands of dollars worth of promised charity donations on the back of funds raised by her book and app, Gibson has been in hiding. The only interview she granted in the wake of the scandal was with Women\u2019s Weekly in April, which shed frustratingly little light on why she had lied about being sick. People living with cancer and their relatives were angered at Gibson\u2019s appearance on 60 Minutes and reports that she would be paid for the interview. 60 Minutes has refused to confirm whether that was the case. But if Gibson expected a sympathetic ear in Brown, she was to be sorely disappointed. Brown consistently challenged Gibson throughout the interview to stop wavering and \u201cjust be honest\u201d. The program revealed that in 2011 Gibson underwent a brain scan at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne which showed she was perfectly healthy. Gibson maintains she believed she had cancer until then \u2013 she claims she was wrongly diagnosed in 2009 by a German alternative medicine practitioner \u2013 but she did not come clean after receiving the results of the scan. Instead, she went on two years later to launch The Whole Pantry mobile phone wellness app and a cookbook of the same name, in which she claimed she had successfully treated terminal brain cancer by shunning radiation and chemotherapy and turning to a healthy diet. She also falsely claimed she had had two heart operations, her heart had stopped on the operating table, and she had had cancer of the blood, uterus and spleen. Yet she told Brown she was as much of a victim as those who believed her. Discovering she did not have terminal brain cancer had been traumatic, she told Brown. \u201cOnce I received the definite, \u2018No, you do not have cancer,\u2019 that was something I had to come to terms with and it was really traumatising and I was feeling a huge amount of grief,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat, that you didn\u2019t have cancer?\u201d Brown asked. \u201cNo, that I had been lied to, that I felt like I had been taken for a ride,\u201d Gibson said. She insisted that once she was \u201cstrong enough\u201d she had planned to reveal to her large following that she was well and had never been sick. But the media had got to her first, she said. Like the interview with Women\u2019s Weekly, the 60 Minutes interview revealed little about Gibson\u2019s past or what motivated her to lie. It was television at its most frustrating rather than compelling. Throughout, Gibson claimed she had simply been living her truth. \u201cI lived for years with the fear that I was dying and I\u2019m still coming to terms with [the fact] I can take that off my shoulders now,\u201d she told Brown. Brown asked Gibson if she understood she may have been responsible for cancer patients shunning their medical treatment to instead follow her diet and wellness regime. \u201cSome want you to go to jail,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m on the receiving end of all that, Tara,\u201d Gibson replied. \u201cI was not an expert in anyone else\u2019s health.\u201d Brown told Gibson she had appealed to \u201cincredibly vulnerable\u201d people and therefore had a responsibility to \u201cmake sure your story is right\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for me to be here,\u201d Gibson responded. At another point in the interview, she said she had \u201clost everything\u201d. Perhaps the extent of Gibson\u2019s confused story was revealed most profoundly when Brown asked her a simple question; her age. Birth records show Gibson is 23. \u201cI\u2019ve always been raised as being currently a 26-year-old,\u201d Gibson said, adding that she had two birth certificates and had changed her name four times. Brown responded: \u201cThis is a really, really simple question. How old are you?\u201d to which Gibson replied: \u201cThat\u2019s probably a question we\u2019ll have to keep digging for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
