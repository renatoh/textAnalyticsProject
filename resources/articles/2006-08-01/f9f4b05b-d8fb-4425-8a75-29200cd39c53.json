Now the spell has cracked and the task before the Conservative leader is being seen for what it is. Changing his party into something electable will not be quick, or easy, or perhaps even possible. Difficulties that were overlooked before are now being pointed out: on policy and on people, as the A-list of preferred candidates struggles to make a difference and the search for a London mayoral candidate runs into the sand. This new clear perception will not surprise Mr Cameron, who has never promised the journey would be easy, but it will certainly test the resolution of his party. If talk of change is to mean anything, it must continue in adversity. Yet Mr Cameron cannot afford to look unbending if he is to keep his promise to offer a thoughtful kind of politics and retain the goodwill of the many Conservatives who are uneasy about modernity. Yesterday he sought to reassure them with the formal launch of a statement of aims and values, a guide to what a Cameron government would mean. The document is built on a draft issued in February and the differences between versions are striking: no mention of compassionate conservativism now and some specific policies to fight the claim that Mr Cameron has none. That charge could still come back to bite the Tory leader at a party conference that will be a critical test for him, but in the meantime his intention is to create a sense of atmosphere, an aroma, as his team sometimes put it, encouraging voters to understand his broad purpose. As such, the document, which will be put to a vote of party members next month, does an effective job. It is sweeping and simple, but it does carry with it a sense of what Mr Cameron wants, a self-starting, socially committed, energetic modern nation. The abiding theme is a conservative scepticism about the state and the greatest weakness is that having dismissed the state as a provider of social justice the document offers nothing in its place beyond vague trust in the power of \"enterprise\". Oliver Letwin, the party's policy head, said recently that the Conservative agenda was being set by \"successive approximation\", a scientific term for discovering the unknown by relating it to known quantities. Yesterday's document may be a thin reference point but it at least offers an agreed basis for the more challenging specifics which must come next."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
