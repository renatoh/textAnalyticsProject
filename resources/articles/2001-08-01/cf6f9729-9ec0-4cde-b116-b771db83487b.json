Yes. The people who board the plane after you and get off first need special travel advice, you know. Just because they can stretch out on the flight to LA doesn't mean it's any easier when they arrive. Really? They have to worry about company etiquette, choosing the right restaurant for a business lunch, killing time between meetings in an unfamiliar city and the threat of street crime. It's difficult to pass yourself off as a penniless backpacker when you're wearing a suit, and these days businesspeople are far more likely to visit cities with a high crime rate like Johannesburg and Moscow. And it can be hard to know where to stay when you're not paying. Or when you need space to work, a power converter for your laptop, and an in-room fax. Most of the hotel recommendations here can be booked via Expedia's website. Is it recession-proof? It's a very good site, but already some of the articles are marked Premium Content, which means you have to pay for them. But it will certainly prove useful if your company can't afford to subsidise your minibar habit any longer and you want to spend as little time as possible at the airport. Unusually for the Economist, however, some of the currency information is a little outdated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
