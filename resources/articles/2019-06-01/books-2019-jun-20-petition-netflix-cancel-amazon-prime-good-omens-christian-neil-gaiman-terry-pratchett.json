The six-part series was released last month, starring David Tennant as the demon Crowley and Michael Sheen as the angel Aziraphale, who collaborate to prevent the coming of the antichrist and an imminent apocalypse. Pratchett\u2019s last request to Gaiman before he died was that he adapt the novel they wrote together; Gaiman wrote the screenplay and worked as showrunner on the BBC/Amazon co-production, which the Radio Times called \u201ca devilishly funny love letter to the book\u201d. But Christians marshalled by the Return to Order campaign, an offshoot of the US Foundation for a Christian Civilisation, disagree. More than 20,000 supporters have signed a petition in which they say that Good Omens is \u201canother step to make satanism appear normal, light and acceptable\u201d, and \u201cmocks God\u2019s wisdom\u201d. God, they complain, is \u201cvoiced by a woman\u201d \u2013 Frances McDormand \u2013 the antichrist is a \u201cnormal kid\u201d and, most importantly, \u201cthis type of video makes light of Truth, Error, Good and Evil, and destroys the barriers of horror that society still has for the devil\u201d. They are calling on Netflix to cancel the show. Gaiman responded to the petition on Twitter, writing: \u201cI love that they are going to write to Netflix to try and get #GoodOmens cancelled. Says it all really. This is so beautiful ... Promise me you won\u2019t tell them?\u201d The publisher and science fiction critic Cheryl Morgan tweeted: \u201cMiraculously God has already done it. Don\u2019t tell them She put it on Amazon instead.\u201d Return to Order is based on the writings of the author John Horvat II. It \u201ccalls upon Americans to put principles into actions by working toward what is called an organic Christian society\u201d. Another of its petitions in April called on Walmart to \u201cstop selling Satanic products\u201d following a 2018 protest against a \u201cblasphemous ice cream chain called Sweet Jesus\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
