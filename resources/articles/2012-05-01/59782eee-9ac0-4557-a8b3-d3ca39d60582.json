A quiet country road provides an easy journey back into Stonehaven. There are a couple of steep ascents during the walk and the paths at the castle can be exposed at times. Why it's so special Surrounded on all sides by sheer cliffs and on three by water, Dunnottar Castle holds one of the most spectacular positions of Scotland's castles. With the waves of the North Sea crashing into the shore below, and wind invariably whipping in from the east, a walk to the castle must be one of the most exhilarating there is. Keep your eyes peeled for Black Hill war memorial. It looks like it's in disrepair, with rubble strewn around its base, but was designed to be symbolic of incomplete lives. The architect was John Ellis of Stonehaven and it was completed in 1923, initially to commemorate those who died in the first world war. Commemorations were later added to those who fell in the second world war. Recover afterwards Four miles south of Stonehaven is the Creel Inn. Perched on cliffs at the fishing village of Catterline, it serves a mouth-watering medley of locally caught seafood. If it's tipping down Try Crathes Castle on the outskirts of Banchory, 15 miles west of Stonehaven. Owned by the National Trust for Scotland since 1951, the interior boasts 16th-century painted ceilings. How to get there Trains and buses run regularly from Aberdeen to Stonehaven. Step by step 1 From Market Square walk along the road towards the sea then turn right to cross Carron Water via a footbridge. Continue around by a beach and through a car park, then turn right and pass by Stonehaven's Old Tolbooth. Turn left along Shorehead then follow the harbour around to turn right into Wallace Wynd. Follow this down then turn left into Castle Street. At the end, a steep path ascends to a road on the clifftop. 2 Turn left and follow the road to a bend then on to a tarmac footpath. Walk up this fenced path, above Strathlethan Bay, making a short diversion to the Black Hill war memorial. 3 From there follow the path around the coastline, bearing right at a signpost to continue above the rugged Castle Haven. At the base of the cliffs a steep climb leads to the entrance of the castle. 4 From the castle follow the wide path to reach a car park beside a minor road. 5 Turn right to pick up the outward-bound route just before Stonehaven harbour. Retrace steps to Market Square."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
