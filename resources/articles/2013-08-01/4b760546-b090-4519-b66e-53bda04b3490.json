What he meant was the north-west. Or perhaps just a part of it. The one time energy minister and former adviser to William Hague, and father-in-law to George Osborne, was trying once more to extract himself from the hole he'd dug himself on Tuesday. Since desolation could hardly describe (even for a former Guildford MP) the Pennine Way, say, or the beaches north of Newcastle, or the national parks in Northumberland and the Lake District, or any number of other places of outstanding natural beauty, it does seem possible he may simply have fused north-east and north-west in his mind and come up with that general wilderness often supposed by southerners to exist north of Watford. Curiously, the area around Balcombe where the anti-fracking protest continues, is also relatively sparsely populated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
