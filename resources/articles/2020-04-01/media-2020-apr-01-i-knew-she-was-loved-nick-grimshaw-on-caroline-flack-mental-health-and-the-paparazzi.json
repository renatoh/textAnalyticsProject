A medical team put him into a car to shield him from the 44C (111F) temperature, and explained what was happening: he was at risk of organ failure. Grimshaw\u2019s body started \u201cvibrating\u201d, as he puts it, and he began to panic. He needed a sedative injection to calm him down. The next morning, he had recovered, but sat out that day\u2019s challenge. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be one of those annoying people who does a trek and is like: \u2018I was changed in Africa,\u2019\u201d says the 35-year-old Radio 1 DJ. \u201cWhen I got back to London, I wrote everything down \u2013 exactly how I was feeling \u2013 so I didn\u2019t forget it. Because it felt really good, and I just want to feel like that for ever.\u201d The expedition was originally scheduled to take place in Mongolia, with the celebrities \u2013 which included the news presenters Louise Minchin and Krishnan Guru-Murthy and the actor Samantha Womack \u2013 expected to complete a 60-mile (100km) trek across the frozen Lake Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l. The threat of Covid-19 meant the challenge shifted at short notice to biking, skiing (down sand dunes) and walking across the world\u2019s oldest desert. What did he make of the switch? \u201cI thought: \u2018Wicked. It will be dead warm,\u2019\u201d Grimshaw says, with his typical deadpan delivery. We meet in Clissold Park, in north London, not far from Grimshaw\u2019s house, and sit down on a bench to talk. Grimshaw says that the challenge, which was set up to raise money for mental health services, is the hardest thing he has ever done. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that [Sport Relief] is going to solve everything, but it\u2019s good that mental health is in the public consciousness more,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m quite lucky in that I\u2019ve not been as severely affected as some people on the trip were,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ve had horrible anxiety that won\u2019t go, and have been feeling down, with really horrible panic attacks. I\u2019m not here being like: \u2018I\u2019ve got severe anxiety.\u2019 But I suffer with anxiety, and when it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s bad.\u201d Grimshaw first experienced anxiety at university, with flashpoints occurring at the times in his career when he has been working too hard and partying harder \u2013 taking on the job of replacing Chris Moyles on the Radio 1 breakfast show in 2012 was a definite strain. Although he has not had a panic attack in years (Namibia aside) he still sees a therapist, although he recognises not everyone can afford to pay for talking therapy. \u201cMost people don\u2019t have the luxury of a spare Thursday afternoon to pop round and see their therapist,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real privilege that I do.\u201d His mental health has become more manageable as his social life has slowed down. \u201cI drink, but I won\u2019t get drunk like I used to,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to just go out all the time, but I guess that\u2019s what you do in your 20s. I used to think my mum and dad were crazy not being in Ibiza. But something happens where you turn 32, I think, and you\u2019re like: \u2018Fuck this.\u2019\u201d This year has been especially tough for Grimshaw: he has lost two close friends, one of whom was the presenter Caroline Flack, who died in February. Her death prompted an astonishing outpouring of grief from the public. \u201cI knew she was very loved,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was so funny, engaging and open. And also really vulnerable. I think a lot of people, me included, saw her in themselves. And it was the most horrible, shocking news.\u201d Grimshaw was in his car on the way to the gym when heard on the radio that Flack had died. He remembers checking his phone and seeing messages come in from his friends. He drove home and cried alone. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to take,\u201d he says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t best friends, but we were close and we\u2019d speak all the time. We\u2019d spoken earlier that week. We had plans to hang out, and I\u2019d been messaging her when all the shit had gone down.\u201d Flack was facing trial, for an alleged attack on her boyfriend, Lewis Burton. She had been forced to step back from presenting Love Island, and had become a tabloid target. \u201cShe was going through a tough time.\u201d Grimshaw met Flack in 2007 at the Hawley Arms pub in Camden \u2013 a famed hangout for the mid-00s north London set, including Amy Winehouse and Noel Fielding. He was doing an internship at MTV nearby, so they would drink there most weeknights. The two went on to work together in 2015 on the 12th series of The X Factor \u2013 Grimshaw as a judge and Flack as a host. Flack was also a regular guest on Grimshaw\u2019s Radio 1 show. \u201cMy experience of Caroline was nothing but joy and fun,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was always one of those people who, if you were having a fine night out, would make it a brilliant night out.\u201d What has he been thinking about since he found out about her death? \u201cThat it could have been avoided,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that always happens when someone dies young, and when I\u2019ve had friends who have passed away before they should have. You always play a bit of \u2018what could I have done?\u2019\u201d Flack\u2019s death put the spotlight on the tabloid press, with many angry at the way her personal life was covered so incessantly by some publications, particularly after her arrest in December. A petition to introduce \u201cCaroline\u2019s law\u201d (which seeks to make it a criminal offence for the media to knowingly bully a person by sensationalising their misfortune) has received more than 860,000 signatures. \u201cWith Caroline, no one was reporting on facts,\u201d says Grimshaw. \u201cThere\u2019s this constant need to dig things out about people. It felt really unnecessary. It felt relentless. It\u2019s really dark. It\u2019s not a funny thing to cover. \u201cSomeone\u2019s life was on the line here. And their relationship, and their family\u2019s lives. I just thought there was no \u2026\u201d he pauses. \u201cWe\u2019re taught about duty of care at Radio 1. I just can\u2019t imagine making light of something like that on the radio, so why would you write it down and print it?\u201d Grimshaw is no stranger to the tabloids himself. In the early days of his career, he would be papped leaving parties with A-listers such as Harry Styles, Kate Moss and Rita Ora. And he\u2019s still photographed when out and about. \u201cI don\u2019t indulge in it,\u201d says Grimshaw. \u201cI think girls get it on a totally different spectrum to guys. I remember when Fearne Cotton was at Radio 1; there were paps outside every single day, and every single day she\u2019d be in the paper. It\u2019s the same with Maya Jama now. Boys don\u2019t really get that. I think with girls there\u2019s so much more to comment on, like: \u2018Oh, they look tired,\u2019 or: \u2018How dare they have roots.\u2019 There\u2019s so much more interest in gossiping about their sex lives or what they\u2019re posting.\u201d Grimshaw\u2019s path to radio began on his childhood bedroom floor in Oldham. He remembers it vividly: creaky wooden floors, a giant Prodigy poster, incense and the voice of John Peel coming out of the speakers on his hi-fi with a double tape deck (which he still has). \u201cI thought I discovered John Peel,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought no one else had heard of him and he was really niche. And everyone was, like: \u2018What, the most famous DJ in the world?\u2019 I vividly remember sitting on the floor with the radio on, like people in the war. Now, I can\u2019t imagine a young person just listening to the radio and not doing something else.\u201d He inherited his love of music from his older brother and sister (13 and 12 years his senior), and would listen to Chris Evans and Sara Cox on his way to school. Away from music, he describes his childhood as fun, his household as noisy, and his school reports as consistent: \u201cNick could be actually really good, and he\u2019s smart, but he will not do any work and he\u2019d rather be the class clown.\u201d Grimshaw never felt the need to come out as gay to his parents \u2013 he suggests it was obvious enough for him not to have to spell it out. \u201cI used to just do Cher and Gloria Estefan shows,\u201d he says, before launching enthusiastically into an anecdote about the time he recreated one of Estefan\u2019s album covers for his bemused parents. \u201cI also remember seeing a picture of David Beckham,\u201d he continues. \u201cHe was in a bath, and it was in black and white, and there was foam on him. I must have been so young because I didn\u2019t find it sexually attractive; I just couldn\u2019t stop looking at it. I remember running out to my dad in the garden being like: \u2018Can I put this on my wall?\u2019 And him being like: \u2018Yes, but with Blu-Tack \u2013 don\u2019t ruin the wall.\u2019\u201d In 2002, he went to the University of Liverpool, where he studied communication and media studies. He spent much of his degree heavily involved in the student radio station and distracted by parties. He never showed up to the graduation ceremony and only found out what he\u2019d left with more than a decade later live on Radio 1. (He\u2019d failed his final year and left with a DipHE.) After a brief spell with a music management and PR agency in Manchester, Grimshaw moved to London, where he helped run club nights while interning at MTV. He got his first shot at TV on E4, hosting daily shows, before moving over to Channel 4 to do its breakfast show, Freshly Squeezed, with Alexa Chung and, later, Jameela Jamil. In September 2007, he was poached by Radio 1 to host the 10pm-midnight slot. He had been there for nearly five years when Ben Cooper, the station\u2019s then controller, offered him the biggest job in radio: replacing Moyles on the Breakfast Show. It was a gig Grimshaw had for nearly six years, making himself a household name in the process. It wasn\u2019t until he stood down from it in 2018, to be replaced by Greg James, that he realised how much of a mental strain the 4am starts and intense criticism of his performance was having. \u201cI was burnt out,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I realised until a few months later. When you do that show, you\u2019re under a lot of scrutiny \u2013 people are slagging you off at 5.30 in the morning. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d taken in that element of it.\u201d Grimshaw was a hit with critics, but ratings dropped during his tenure \u2013 according to Rajar, 5.1 million people listened to the show when he announced he was leaving, the second-lowest audience since records began. The response from Grimshaw and station executives was always the same: they wanted to attract the younger listeners who had left the station during the Moyles years, even if it meant a drastic drop in overall listeners. \u201cRatings are important, although I never paid too much attention to them,\u201d says Grimshaw. \u201cIt was hard to know exactly what they were measuring it against because our bosses were saying at the time: \u2018Our average listener is too old. We want young people.\u2019 So I had a specific brief. When I look back \u2026 that\u2019s a bit of a shitty brief for the Nick Grimshaw brand,\u201d he says, knowing that he was essentially being asked to dramatically reduce the overall listeners to narrow the age bracket. \u201cWas that a good idea for me?\u201d It certainly doesn\u2019t seem to have done his career much harm. On leaving the Breakfast Show in 2018, he was given a comfortable drive-time slot. And, after a year that began with announcements of job losses and aggressive budget cuts, the BBC has received praise for the way it has adapted to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cLoads of people are messaging into Radio 1 being like: \u2018You guys are really helping us. We\u2019re bored at home and we\u2019re really liking this,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like the thing that first made me want to do radio. The only brief we\u2019ve had is to just be yourself, be honest.\u201d Does he think he will remain at the BBC when the time comes to move on? \u201cI hope so,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I only wanted to do the Radio 1 Breakfast Show. I never listened to anything else. I still don\u2019t listen to anything else: I have Radio 1, 1Xtra and 6 Music, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d No plans to move back to television, then? \u201cI definitely still want to do radio,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never not liked it, and I\u2019ve never gone into work and felt worse \u2013 because I just love chatting to people. The only two things I like are listening to songs and chatting shit. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve managed to get a career out of it.\u201d Nick Grimshaw hosts the drive-time slot on BBC Radio 1 from 3pm every Monday to Thursday In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.
