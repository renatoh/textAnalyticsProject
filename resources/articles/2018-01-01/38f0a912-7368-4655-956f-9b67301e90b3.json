The Spiritual Dark Age \u2013 a title that betrays the lack of a lyrical light touch at times \u2013 flits around, alighting on big American rock (My God &amp; Your God, Bar Fights), heavily emoted piano ballads (And Yet \u2026), scratchy post-punk (The Unspeakable Crimes of Peter Popoff), and Mumfords-esque anthemic stadium folk (the title track), without ever settling. They sound not like themselves, but rather a compilation tape of assorted mainstream indie trends of this century. To Kill a King are skilful \u2013 Ralph Pelleymounter has a lustrous voice (though it sounds better the less he self-consciously \u201csings\u201d) and they know how to write melodies \u2013 but the The Spiritual Dark Age sounds like a group playing within themselves, never quite willing to cut loose to the extent they could. Maybe this is as far as they go, in which case the world has another band who sound a bit like the many moods of Arcade Fire \u2013 fine so far as it goes. But it\u2019s frustrating to listen to a group and suspect there\u2019s something much more interesting in there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
