Both sides know political moods are mercurial, fickle and unpredictable. There may indeed be a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune - but how do you know for certain when that tide is? Remember how Gordon Brown was goaded: a coward who dared not wield the knife probably wasn't fit to lead the party anyway. Damned if he did, damned if he didn't; he is also damned if he echoes the PM and damned if he differs. But when the conspirators charged at Caesar they only stabbed him in the leg, leaving a wounded emperor alive to savage them back. Look how the Brown-haters retaliated. Joining Charles Clarke's intemperate double-blast in the gleeful Telegraph and London Evening Standard came more insults from Blairites in the delighted Sunday Times and Mail: \"autistic\", \"compulsive-obsessive\" and \"pathological\", with Mo Mowlam's husband tossing in \"childish vanity\", \"paranoia\" and \"a bunker mentality\". If Gordon Brown began as the noble Brutus, the backlash is trying to cast him as Cassius, with an itching palm for power. But note how all the heavy guns of the Tory press target him - presumably because, whatever they may say, they still fear him as the oak tree most likely to expose David Cameron as a willow bending in every wind. The party holds its breath. Today Tony Blair speaks at the TUC. Faced with a wounded PM, the unions may reckon the tide is right for them to advance, reminding everyone who bankrolls Labour. Once power is weakened and that string untuned, some will stir more discord. So, deep in fratricidal blood, can Labour step back? Never underestimate the raging passions in a schism: no one forgives or forgets, ever. It takes the merest spark to set a forest fire. Since Tony Blair finds offending his own party almost irresistible, it would take very little provocation from him now to remind another wave of backbenchers how much they want him gone. Though after last week, another assault would be madness. But will Alan Milburn guard his tongue in his speech on Thursday? Stephen Byers has cancelled articles and speeches this week for fear of starting more fires. Brown's side hurries to deny that Doug Henderson speaks for them, while the Blairites swear (convincingly) that Clarke never spoke with their sanction. What No 10 calls, a tad acidly, \"the New Gordon\" emerged from his emollient television interview on Sunday to hit the telephones until late into the evening. As far as I can tell, he seems to have called just about every minister and MP of whichever persuasion, bombing them with messages of peace and reconciliation. He wants debate. He will be open to all talents and all ideas. He does welcome a contest and not a coronation. His team is now genuinely convinced a strong leadership election is essential - which is just as well. Because the Stop Gordon brigades say it is now absolutely certain that some current or former cabinet minister will stand against him. That was not the case, they claim, until this coup attempt, but it is now for sure. Is this their revenge? They claim not, of course. They say this furore has opened up the leadership question in a way that now demands the party gets a real choice, with the issues debated out in the open air. No more mumbling in code. Neither the party nor voters can be fobbed off with a phoney election now. So who will it be? It hardly matters: John Reid, Clarke, Byers or Milburn would be equally unlikely to win many votes - though all of these are in danger of running a personal and bilious campaign that could see Labour's next leader emerge badly damaged. No, the man the Blairites are looking to is Alan Johnson. The Tory press and Blairites alike have leapt on this relatively unknown newcomer as the man to trounce their enemy, garlanding him with lavish praise. Now they emphasise the times he has stood up to the unions (before, the Tory press branded him as the man who gave in to them on public employee pensions). Glowing eulogies from all these Stop Gordon Labour and Tory interests might well turn a less sane head. Nicely Nicely Johnson (Guys and Dolls fans will remember him) is being presented to the world as their man for all seasons. But there is one thing badly wrong with this scenario. The man himself seems far too sensible to play any such destructive game. He is too wise a politician to have this unsavoury, wrecking role thrust upon him. In fact, those who know him best say he will have none of it. So it seems certain he will only stand if some Blairite candidate stands first. In other words, he will not be their champion. But he might enter the race as a third force, intent on keeping the election clean, stopping it descending into internecine abuse. What's more, he would not enter the lists expecting to emerge as leader, but as a marker for his deputy leadership bid. The chemistry of these contests means that those who realistically expect no more than the deputy leadership or a prominent cabinet post suddenly feel obliged to join the main game, so more hats might then be tossed in too. One question being asked is this: could Gordon Brown and Alan Johnson become a peace-making dream ticket? Technically, the election doesn't allow for any such twinning, but then in 1994 Tony Blair all but endorsed John Prescott by letting it be known he was the one with the leader's support. Another question though: would Johnson be able to deliver the Blairite faction and stop them sniping at Brown's leadership? Or will nothing stop the blood feud for years to come? It is now certain that there will be a wide-open leadership contest. Could Gordon Brown lose? Highly unlikely. Only if he were to run such a disastrous campaign that he doesn't deserve to win. Although forcing a contest may be a Blairite plot designed to unseat him, a proper election is just what Brown needs. The New Gordon - open, embracing, collaborative - needs the chance to prove he really can be those things, confronting head on those doubts about his character. Can he do it? Most think he can, quite easily. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
