So many eastern Europeans struggle to acclimatise to the life of celebrity and opulence in Serie A but from the moment he left Kiev for Milan he assured Valery Lobanovsky, the legendary Ukrainian coach, that he would return with a European Cup winner's medal. And at Old Trafford tonight he intends to fulfil the promise. After Shevchenko had scored the goal against Internazionale that propelled the rossoneri to their first final since 1995, a moment that placed him alongside great players such as Jose Altafini, Giuseppe Meazza, Juan Schiaffino, Sandro Mazzola and Luis Suarez who have written their goals into the history of the Milan derby, his thoughts turned back to that conversation. \"I'm dedicating this moment to Lobanovsky [his Dynamo Kiev and Ukrainian national team manager]. He died a year ago to the exact day and I wanted to wear a black armband in memory of him. That wasn't possible, so I scored for him instead,\" he said. \"He was my mentor, my coach and my manager. He was a part of my life and I owe him so much. I will be playing this final for him and the people of Ukraine.\" It was a typical Shevchenko speech. In the four years that have passed since Silvio Berlusconi deemed him to be worth \u00a318m of Milan's money, offering him a free holiday on his yacht if he were to finish his first season as Serie A's leading scorer (a promise the club president had to fulfil), he has developed a reputation as one of the most formidable centre-forwards in the world and his thank-you speeches have never overlooked the people of his country. Likewise, the followers of Kiev who saw him make his Champions League debut at the age of 17, score a hat-trick against Barcelona in the Camp Nou, finish as the competition's leading scorer the following season and eliminate Real Madrid with two goals in 1999, have never allowed his defection to blur their appreciation of a man who, as the nine-year-old son of a Red Army NCO, was evacuated to the Black Sea after the Chernobyl disaster. The young Shevchenko returned to Kiev to score 60 goals in 118 games as half of a deadly partnership with Sergei Rebrov, winning five championships and three domestic cups. In the Dynamo Store, a five-minute walk from the Respublikanski stadium, the shirts with his name still regularly outsell those of the current players. And in the vodka bars in the capital's labyrinthine streets the locals will huddle around the televisions tonight waiting for a bulletin on how he has done. Much will depend on whether he can prise open the parsimonious Juventus defence which, apart from two bad nights against Manchester United when the squad were suffering from a powerful virus, has been the catalyst for their first European Cup final since 1998. \"I am sure I can do well,\" he insists. \"They are a good side but of all the great teams we have faced this season we have beaten all of them at least once.\" His admirers point to his record of 36 goals in 63 European matches as to why he could provide a decisive contribution, and at the weekend there was a glowing reference from Sir Alex Ferguson: \"Filippo Inzaghi scores goals but he's not on the same plateau as Shevchenko in terms of what you need in games like this.\" Yet Shevchenko, 26, also has to reflect on what, in truth, has been a bittersweet season, one that could reach an exhilarating climax tonight but arguably, too, the toughest of his four years in Italy. Having scored 24 goals in each of his first two seasons with Milan, he has managed only nine this campaign. He has had injury problems, periods out of the team and persistent rumours about his future - United have been linked with him on several occasions - to the point where he admits he thought about seeking a transfer. \"I was unlucky to get injured so early in the season and I was out for a few months. But step by step I was able to rediscover my form, despite a few other injury problems. But, even when you take all that into account, I scored our first goal when we beat Real in the group stages and now the goal against Inter. To win at Old Trafford would make it a wonderful season.\" Shevchenko's Euro stats Champions League 2002-03 Minutes on pitch: 736 Inside box Goals: 3 Shots on target: 8 Shots off target: 10 Accuracy: 44% Outside box Goals: 1 Shots on target: 3 Shots off target: 2 Accuracy: 60% Goals to shots ratio Inside box: 17% Outside box: 20% Overall: 17%"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
