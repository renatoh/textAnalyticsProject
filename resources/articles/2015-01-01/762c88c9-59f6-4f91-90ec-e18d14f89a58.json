The Egyptian court of cassation upheld an appeal by Greste and his al-Jazeera colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed after the trio were found guilty of spreading false news and supporting the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood organisation in June. \u201cThere is some cause for optimism because now Peter Greste\u2019s appeal has been upheld, that means the conviction has been overturned,\u201d Bishop told the Nine network early on Friday morning. \u201cHe is now back in the position of an accused person awaiting a trial. So that opens up a whole raft of new options for Peter and his family.\u201d Greste and Fahmy, who is a dual Egyptian-Canadian national, have applied for deportation. \u201cIn the past, the Egyptian government has indicated that they would consider some kind of prisoner transfer agreement and they do have a new law that was introduced recently, and it does give some optimism for us that he could be transferred back to Australia under that law,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cHowever, now that the appeal has been upheld, the conviction overturned, I think there are more possibilities, more options available to the Grestes.\u201d Greste\u2019s brothers Andrew and Mike told reporters in Brisbane the family was disappointed the charges were not quashed but a retrial was \u201cthe next best result for us\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been recognised the first trial was flawed,\u201d Mike Greste said. \u201cPeter in our view is completely innocent, so now the court recognises he\u2019s now an innocent man and we start again.\u201d Andrew Greste said the change in status from a convict to an accused person \u201creally does strengthen\u201d his brother\u2019s bid for deportation to Australia by presidential decree. Peter Greste\u2019s lawyer has now amended an application originally made several weeks ago. The family was now fixing its hopes on deportation as the best chance of getting Greste home because a retrial \u2013 which would be the journalist\u2019s next opportunity for release on bail \u2013 could be a \u201clengthy\u201d process some months away. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be hopeful,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new decree and there\u2019s very little understood about it. There\u2019s very little regulation, there\u2019s no precedent, so obviously we\u2019re in uncharted waters there. But I\u2019d like to think the decree was enacted to be used, so we\u2019re going to test it out.\u201d The family did not know Peter\u2019s response to news of the retrial, as no one would be allowed to speak to him until Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m assuming the grapevine has probably run pretty well and he knows the outcome of the decision but as to a reaction from him, we don\u2019t [know],\u201d Andrew said. Bishop dismissed calls from the Australian-born human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson for the Australian government to \u201cshirt-front\u201d president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi over Greste\u2019s release. \u201cI think the course of action that he is suggesting would have been highly counterproductive,\u201d she said. \u201cIs he suggesting that if an Egyptian national were before a British court, he would be shirt-fronting British judges? I think not. \u201cIf this were an Egyptian national facing controversial charges in a court in Australia, we wouldn\u2019t be in a position to interfere with the independence of the Australian judiciary. Well, President al-Sisi is saying that the same applies in Egypt,\u201d Bishop said. Robertson said Greste\u2019s best hope of release lay with a political solution rather than a judicial one. \u201cThis is a game, a cat-and-mouse game and it\u2019s silly to pin hopes on the kinds of things that happen in Australian courts, where you have bail hearings and so forth,\u201d Robertson told ABC radio on Friday morning. \u201cThis will be solved only when leaders and governments in the western world that have some sway over Egypt, like America, start speaking out about the preposterous way in which Egypt is dealing with journalists who are utterly innocent.\u201d Robertson has raised concerns about Egyptian prosecution lawyers introducing \u201cfabricated evidence\u201d during Greste\u2019s retrial, which he said could potentially turn into a \u201cshow trial\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a cat-and-mouse game which a system can play, and it\u2019s been very effective for the Egyptians,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cThe stage of public condemnation may be the best way forward for Peter Greste and his innocent friends.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
