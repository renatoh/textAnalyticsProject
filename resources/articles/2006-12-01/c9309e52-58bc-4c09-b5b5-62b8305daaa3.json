Craig Brackenbury, 20, was banned from Grantham town centre and Grantham college, in Lincolnshire, for two years in October 2005 under the conditions of his Asbo, after assaulting four people in the shopping centre in as many days and behaving in a way described by community police as \"aggressive and intimidating\". Angered by his naming and shaming in the local press, Brackenbury nevertheless decided to stick to his Asbo. \"I didn't enjoy hanging around and mouthing off,\" he says. \"People were scared to come near me.\" So why did he behave so badly? \"Problems I had in me. I get a gob on when I drink.\" Brackenbury says if it wasn't for the Asbo he would without a doubt be in jail by now. \"I didn't want to be in prison,\" he says. \"And my mum wanted me to have the Asbo. She couldn't handle me any more.\" Since the Asbo was imposed, Brackenbury has stopped drinking, attended anger management courses and found a place in a supported housing scheme. He has not been in trouble with the police, apart from one minor breach when he sneaked into the shopping centre. He attributes the success partly to the regular guidance of South Kesteven district council's community safety team, who applied for the Asbo. \"They made me realise that this was no way for a 19-year-old to behave,\" he says. \"I started to act like an adult. Just knowing there are people who care was important.\" The community support team is confident that the order will have been relinquished by July 2007. Sandy Kavanagh, South Kesteven's community safety officer, says: \"Craig demonstrates that Asbos work as an excellent tool, as long as the conditions are proportionate to the behaviour and they are only used as the last resort.\" Of the 50 cases of antisocial behaviour the team deals with each month, 70% are resolved by talking to the perpetrator, sending warning letters, or with the offender signing an acceptable behaviour contract. It has issued 17 Asbos, of which a handful have been breached and led to a custodial sentence. Brackenbury, who is sharing his experience with other young people and hopes to return to college, is not yet ready to live without sanctions. He says: \"I'm scared I might still get into trouble if someone mouths off.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
