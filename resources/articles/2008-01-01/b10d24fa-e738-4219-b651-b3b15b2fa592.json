Tower Colliery, the only pit owned by miners, closes this week. Thirteen years after 239 die-hard workers marched beneath their lodge banner to reclaim their pit and their livelihood, the dream is over, the coal seam is worked out and they will clock off for one final time on Friday. But they leave with no little sense of pride. 'There will be another march, but not on that day. That's not the right time. The men will be leaving with their own thoughts,' said Tyrone O'Sullivan, the National Union of Mineworkers' lodge secretary who headed the Tower employees' buyout and who is now chairman of their company. 'But later, at the Penywaun perhaps, the club where we first made the decision to buy and where the story began, we might have a couple of drinks and a couple of speeches. It would be good getting the banner out and marching again. It's been 13 years - 13 years that we did not think we would have. 'There will be some tears. The Welsh are emotional anyway. But the pit means so much to us. Whatever happens in life, it's been a great company. We changed all the rules. We broke the system. It isn't just a company, it's a family.' It was on 3 January 1995 that the 239 men, who had each contributed \u00a38,000 from their redundancy packages towards raising the \u00a32m deposit, reopened the colliery near Hirwaun in south Wales. British Coal had closed it on the grounds that it was uneconomical. The men disagreed. Their jobs, the welfare of their families, their community and their pride were all invested in that pit, just as it had been for their forebears who had toiled there since 1805. Their buyout, and the pit's obvious financial viability, has since stood as an indictment against the Conservative government's coal mining policy - a sweet victory made yet sweeter as their preferred bidder status in the private market was announced at a Tory party conference. So the socialists became capitalists. Today they have 480 acres of land in the Cynon Valley. It's a bleak landscape but, given its proximity to the Brecon Beacons, ripe for redevelopment. Last week the shareholders conducted a secret ballot over plans for the site. A decision is yet to be announced, but there is talk of selling to developers and of its potential for retail, housing and leisure facilities. 'No, we are not going to be millionaires. There are 300 of us, and we won't be wealthy,' said O'Sullivan. 'But there could be an income. Not that we planned that when we took over. We bought the pit because it would secure our jobs. But it could mean that for the first time in their lives people will receive an income for doing bugger all, and that doesn't happen very often for people of our class. Each man put in \u00a38,000. So if we get, say, \u00a38,000-\u00a310,000 back, that will be an achievement. 'If it works out that we get an income from any development of \u00a3100 a week, if you haven't got a job, that is going to be a huge help. That will be one hell of an achievement.' The workers do not want the site to be grassed over. 'If we can create something else that will, perhaps, bring 1,000 jobs or more, that would be a fitting epitaph,' said O'Sullivan. 'We want the pit to be a monument to the workers, to all the people killed here, including my own father who was killed here in 1963.' Around 70 are expected to transfer to the nearby Aberpergwm drift mine. 'There's a deep loyalty,' said O'Sullivan. 'We're not going to become the lost tribe, the dead community. We will forever remember when coal was king, but we've got to move on. And when we walk away from that pit, it should be backwards, bowing, like you would do to the Queen. Because that's what it means to us.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
