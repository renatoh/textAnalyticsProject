Apologising to anyone who may have taken offence, Ian Gibson, the Labour MP for Norwich North, said he had been trying to make a serious point about the high incidence in the county of type one diabetes. \"Words like 'inbreeding' and 'outbreeding' are very professional, genetic terms,\" he told BBC Radio. \"We use them all the time but to the public that has connotations which they don't understand, or feel that it demeans them and I understand that and that is why I apologise. It has obviously caused a lot of offence and for that I unreservedly apologise.\" Dr Gibson, who has a PhD in genetics and was dean of the School of Biological Sciences at the University of East Anglia for six years, was originally prompted to talk about the issue after publication of local medical research. Some 345 children in Norfolk have type one diabetes - more than double the 160 predicted cases for the county of that population. Asked about the findings by the Eastern Daily Press newspaper, he was quoted as saying: \"I would imagine it is linked to the fact that people in Norfolk are quite inbred with many not leaving the county. \"If you look at the names in Norfolk, there's a lot that are the same. There is an inbreeding complex in villages - people intermarry. That might mean more of them have got the same gene which predisposes them to it.\" Taking issue with Dr Gibson, the main charity for sufferers, Diabetes UK, expressed doubts about his claims. \"Diabetes is a complex and misunderstood condition,\" said Angela Wilson, its director of research. \"It has many causes, including lifestyle, environment and ... genetics. However, the Norfolk data would indicate that genetics is unlikely to be the prime cause of a sudden increase in diabetes cases.\" Dr Gibson said yesterday: \"I just hope in the study that is taking place they will look at the genetic influences and take it into consideration when they come to understand the structure of the genetic pool in an area like Norfolk. \"This is a particular form where there is some evidence that there is a genetic component and you have to unravel the interaction between the genes and the environment, which is a very difficult area.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
