The move comes after Le Pen, 86, launched a scathing attack on his youngest daughter Marine \u2013 who now leads the FN \u2013 saying she had behaved in a scandalous manner and that he was disowning her. On Monday night, Le Pen said his new political group would not rival the FN, the party he founded in 1972. \u201cI\u2019m not going to create another party, I\u2019m going to form a group that will not compete with the FN,\u201d Le Pen told Radio Courtoisie. With typical provocation, the outspoken political veteran added the group would be \u201ca parachute in case of disaster; a way of putting pressure to return to the political line that has been followed for decades\u201d. Marine Le Pen has made electoral gains in France by \u201cde-demonising\u201d the FN in the last few years. Since she took over as party president in 2011, she has attempted to clean up the party of its thuggish, skinhead element, while continuing a hardline nationalist programme built on opposition to immigration, Islam and the European Union. Her efforts to rehabilitate the FN\u2019s image, however, have been regularly hampered by her father\u2019s provocative outbursts. Last week, after Le Pen p\u00e8re repeated his assertion that the Holocaust was a mere \u201cdetail\u201d of the second world war and made further incendiary comments including a defence of France\u2019s collaborationist leader Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, his daughter\u2019s patience ran out and he was ordered to attend a party disciplinary hearing. Jean-Marie Le Pen refused saying it was \u201cbelow his dignity\u201d. He told French journalists after being informed he was suspended from the party: \u201cI\u2019m ashamed that the president of the Front National bears my name. I suggest she gets rid of it as fast as possible ... I don\u2019t want the head of the FN to be called Le Pen.\u201d On Monday evening, Le Pen, who is also facing being stripped of his honorary president title, said he was hoping his daughter would put him before her advisers who he described as a \u201csmall group of predators ... a mafia\u201d. \u201cIf Marine Le Pen can find once again the path of free speech, if she is capable of taking responsibilities that are not suggested by her bad advisers, I believe anything is possible,\u201d he told Radio Courtoisie. \u201cI think we have to restore a real democracy in the movement ... I am the symbol of the determined faced with decadence.\u201d A week on, he was also more conciliatory towards his daughter: \u201cMarine Le Pen has great qualities. She is a person who stands up, who shoulders crushing responsibilities,\u201d he said. A Front National spokesperson played down Le Pen\u2019s latest outburst saying it was a non-event for the party. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to be? An association of friends of Jean-Marie Le Pen, by Jean-Marie Le Pen, for Jean-Marie Le Pen and presided over by Jean-Marie Le Pen.\u201d He added that it \u201cwent without saying\u201d that the FN would have nothing to do with the association."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
