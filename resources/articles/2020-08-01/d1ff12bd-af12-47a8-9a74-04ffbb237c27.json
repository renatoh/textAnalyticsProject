Q&A", "bodyText": "The UK government has removed France from its list of travel corridors, and advised against all but essential travel to France, Monaco, the Netherlands, and Malta. The move leaves thousands of holidaymakers scrambling to rearrange their travel plans. A 14-day quarantine on return to the UK from France, and the other affected countries will come into effect from 4am on Saturday (15 August). The UK criteria for removing a country from the list is based on per capita case numbers. If these go above 20 per 100,000, the UK government categorises that country as high-risk. On 13 August, France\u2019s 14-day cumulative number was 32.1, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Eurotunnel has advised customers currently in France, and hoping to return early, that they must amend their tickets online at eurotunnel.com, before travelling to the terminal. \u201cThe service is already very busy this weekend and there is no additional capacity. To avoid long queues and severe disruption we strongly advise against turning up at the terminal outside the allocated time. Customers will be unable to board alternative shuttles without a valid booking,\u201d it says. Can I travel to France anyway? Some travellers may choose to accept the 14-day quarantine on return to the UK and travel regardless. However, the fact that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has also updated its travel advice to advise against all but essential travel to France means you will have no travel insurance if you do. On return, working from home may be an option, but bear in mind that quarantine rules are much stricter than lockdown. You are not allowed outside beyond your home or garden, to exercise or walk the dog. Children will not be able to start school. No visitors are allowed, apart from carers. Those in quarantine can only leave their homes to seek urgent medical assistance or to obtain basic necessities, such as food and medicine, where no one else can do so on their behalf. Anyone caught breaking quarantine faces a fine of up to \u00a31,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and \u00a3480 in Scotland; persistent offenders can be fined up to \u00a35,000. Most travel policies will cover medical expenses for those who were already in France before the announcement \u2013 but anyone who travels after the advice changes wouldn\u2019t be able to get help with hospital bills. If I travel, what can I expect from my holiday in France? Wearing masks in enclosed public spaces is compulsory for those aged 11 and over. This includes restaurants and bars, museums, shops, hotels and shared holiday properties, leisure centres, and holiday parks. Masks are also mandatory on public transport and in taxis, and those not wearing them could face fines. Social distancing is expected in other public areas, such as beaches \u2013 some of which have roped-off zones for sunbathers \u2013 as well as in town squares, campsites and around swimming pools. What should I do if I\u2019m already on holiday in France? You have until 4am on Saturday (15 August) to get home before the quarantine requirement comes into force. Expect a rush to the ferry ports, and expensive last-minute flights home if you need to shorten a trip. Most travellers will have to carry on as before and return home as planned. If I cancel my ferry booking, will I get a refund? Unless you booked a fully refundable ticket, it is unlikely. However, the ferry firms are mostly allowing passengers with bookings up to 31 August to rebook for free, or offering vouchers that can be used next year. DFDS is offering travel credits that expire on 1 September 2021 and P&amp;O\u2019s vouchers last a year. Brittany Ferries is the exception: it is saying that normal terms and conditions apply, so you will lose your money unless you booked a refundable ticket. Eurotunnel is allowing passengers who can\u2019t travel the option to rebook next clear, or ultimately claim a voucher. What about airlines/Eurostar? The fact that flights are still operating means airlines are under no obligation to give refunds to those who choose not to travel. When Spain was taken off the no-quarantine list, British Airways and Ryanair declined to help passengers who could no longer travel. The Ryanair website states: \u201cPlease note that a government imposed advice on quarantine period will not result in the flight being cancelled and an automatic entitlement to refunds.\u201d Easyjet says customers who no longer wish to travel can transfer their flights without a change fee or receive a voucher for the value of the booking. Eurostar says passengers with a booking up to 7 September can request a voucher that would be valid for 12 months from the date of issue. What about my accommodation? Again, accommodation providers are under no obligation to offer a refund, unless it was part of the original terms and conditions. Some hotels did offer cancellation options to encourage bookings, so check the reservation terms. Airbnb is allowing those who booked their trip on or before 14 March the option to cancel trips up to the end of August if \u201cthe pandemic is preventing you from completing your reservation\u201d. Its standard cancellation terms apply to all bookings made after 14 March. Some people will end up losing half their money. I have a package booked \u2013 what will happen? Package holidays are Atol-protected meaning holidaymakers are entitled to a full refund when the FCO advises against all but essential travel to a destination. The opportunity to change to alternative dates or destinations may be offered first. Will my insurance pay out? Now that the FCO has advised against travel, those with annual travel policies bought before the pandemic will be able to claim for cancellation. However, most travel policies bought after March excluded cancellation claims caused by the pandemic, meaning few claims for cancelled trips will be covered. Will I be paid while in quarantine? You\u2019re not automatically entitled to statutory sick pay if you are self-isolating after returning from holiday, according to industrial relations body Acas. If you can work from home, for instance, you can be paid as normal. But if you can\u2019t, a solution could be to take annual leave. Downing Street has said those denied pay after being forced to isolate should claim universal credit, or seek arbitration. Employment lawyers have said that only those with two years\u2019 service are protected against being made redundant for failing to come to work. Those with Covid-19 symptoms and who are self-isolating are entitled to statutory sick pay of \u00a396 a week or higher."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
