One of the authors was asked by a disgruntled small boy, \"why do you have so many creatures in your books? It really annoys me\"). Today it was the turn of the youngest schoolchildren as a reception class of four and five year olds were treated to author Malachy Doyle reading from his award-winning book The Dancing Tiger and singing and acting along to One, Two, Three O'Leary. He was followed by Ian Whybrow who read and sang from Here Comes Harry with his Bucketful of Dinosaurs.
