The Newcastle United manager meant the public of East Anglia, from where Dyer hails, the midfielder's well- received appearance being offered as a gesture of fellowship to Ipswich Town in troubled times when Newcastle were one up and heading for victory. Far beyond Ipswich, however, Dyer's short run-out, his first for nine months, carried a much greater resonance, because if he is fit he will go to the World Cup. This is not mere newspaper speculation; within the Football Association's headquarters at Soho Square it is accepted fact. Sven-Goran Eriksson is not the type to be explicit about such matters but when he said on Sunday that \"the door is still open\" with regard to Dyer, what he left unsaid was that the smallest push would take the player through to Japan. A more solid effort and Dyer will be in the England line-up for the opening game against Sweden in Saitama on Sunday June 2 - on the left. For that to happen, first and foremost, requires his physical fitness. Robson said on Sunday that Dyer \"is a naturally fit boy\" - he will be 23 on December 29 - but, after such a lengthy lay-off caused by a stress fracture of a shin and then a complication with muscle around the knee, Newcastle's first training session featuring him a fortnight ago was tackle-free. Gradually, though, the cotton wool has been removed. Dyer will be on the bench again tomorrow night at Chelsea in the Worthington Cup quarter-final, and on Saturday he may be in the starting line-up when Blackburn visit St James' Park. On Wednesday week Newcastle are at Highbury in the Premiership. Eriksson or Tord Grip will be present at one of those three games. \"Kieron's in the process of training really well and getting full fitness,\" said Robson. \"He's not yet ready but in another two weeks he'll be mustard. He's got his sights set on the World Cup.\" That may seem premature but, with England's left side still a problem area, even the few minutes Dyer played at Ipswich were enough to stimulate the international debate. \"He is very important to us and I am sure he will also be important to England,\" his club captain Alan Shearer said on Sunday, and yesterday Robert Lee agreed: \"He's an exceptional talent; I'm sure he'll be in the England squad for a long time.\" Lee was the last Newcastle midfielder to be an England regular and not even the fact that he called Dyer \"90% right foot\" could persuade him otherwise than that starting on the left would be his team-mate's England role. Lee specified \"starting\". \"He's played on the left for us and he has been fantastic,\" said Lee. \"But he's not one of those who you say to stay there and he will. He'll start there but he will want to roam about and he will roam about. A bit like Steve McManaman - when he was at his best for Liverpool he was in the free role.\" Would that not make Dyer, like McManaman, a little too flexible for Eriksson's strict 4-4-2 formation? Not according to Lee. \"Everybody wants a rigid system when you've lost the ball, but when England are going forward Kieron will have the licence to go everywhere. I'm sure Sven is not going to tell him off if he scores a goal from the right.\" Leeds United continue to hover in the background at club level - Stephen McPhail was allegedly offered as a makeweight the last time Leeds and Newcastle had the discussion - but of more immediate concern to Dyer is the England timescale. He knows that the next friendly, against Holland in Amsterdam in February, would be a good time to win his ninth cap. After Sunday's game - when he said he \"needed a new pair of lungs after just one minute\" - he talked of needing eight or nine matches to regain full fitness. He has two months to get to that stage and, as he said, \"six months to prove myself to the England manager. But I am not stupid. I have not spoken to Mr Eriksson but I saw Tord Grip recently and he asked me how I was doing. \"I have so many friends in the England team - Rio Ferdinand, Emile Heskey, Richard Wright - and they have been telling me what great times it is with England and what a great manager Mr Eriksson is. It has been music to my ears, yet at the same time I have been gutted because I was not part of it. But their comments always gave me the incentive to get through this.\" Dyer was also sensitive to Nick Barmby's situation. Barmby is the current resident in England's left midfield, even though injuries and loss of form have restricted him to one full 90 minutes for Liverpool in the Premiership this season, in September. \"It is very harsh on Nick Barmby to say it is a problem position,\" Dyer said. \"He has played his part in getting us to the World Cup.\" Dyer may be the man to profit from Barmby's ankle damage, though. \"I am confident,\" he said, \"as one of my main strengths is my versatility. If the England manager wanted to try me out there I would be more than willing to give it my best shot.\" Eriksson's wide boys David Dunn Blackburn Rovers No caps yet and only 21, but he is having an impressive season for his club and the England Under-21s. He could be the main rival to Dyer. Nick Barmby Liverpool An ankle injury has ruled him out for two months. If he struggles to recapture his Anfield place, where he faces competition from Patrik Berger, he will be impossible to pick. Steve McManaman Real Madrid He is probably one bad game away from never playing for England again. His attitude is under scrutiny and he needs a big performance soon. Graeme Le Saux Chelsea Yet to be chosen by Eriksson. The most defensive of those to be considered, which could be seen as a plus. Trevor Sinclair West Ham Has a good chance despite being a natural right-winger. He is playing well in league and has the attribute that Eriksson rates highly: speed. Darren Anderton Tottenham An outsider, he is not yet 30 but would need to show outstanding form. Last played for England as a substitute in Turin last November under Peter Taylor. Emile Heskey Liverpool Will go to Japan as a forward. First used on the left by Howard Wilkinson and played the last minutes against Greece at Old Trafford there. He has the pace to do an up-and-down job, but has a limited left foot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
