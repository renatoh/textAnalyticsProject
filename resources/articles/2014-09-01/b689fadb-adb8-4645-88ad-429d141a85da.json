What more is there to say? Makarova is evidently no mug, and fought back well to avoid complete humiliation in the second set, but we didn\u2019t learn anything we didn\u2019t know, or the very least suspect with a sense of gathering dread, before the start of the match. Serena Williams is in good nick, and when she is in good nick there\u2019s not much many in the women\u2019s game can do to nick a game from her, let alone a match or a grand slam semi-final. Serena will thus go for her 18th grand slam singles title on Sunday, against Caroline Wozniacki, a former world No1 who will nonetheless be going for her first after Shuai Peng retired in their semi-final today. And the two of them are good friends. And with that, goodnight. Makarova is straight off court, raising a forlorn hand as she disappears into the changing rooms. Meanwhile, a question: How did Lee do it at Appomattox? With as much dignity as possible. Serena Williams as Ulysses S Grant. Can I do that? Grant\u2019s nickname was \u201cUnconditional Surrender\u201d, so maybe I can. Serena is speaking, anyway: It feels so good\u2026 I am so happy you have no idea. I don\u2019t know what to say. I knew she\u2019s such an aggressive player so I was really focused and tried to win. On Wozniacki, who she will play in the final: She wants to win and I want to win and regardless I\u2019m going to be happy with the outcome. Ho-hum. I wasn\u2019t expecting a disquisition on Kant, or indeed Hobbes, or even a discussion on all three volumes of Shelby Foote\u2019s Narrative History of the Civil War. But, y\u2019know. That\u2019s not even soundbites. Ho-hum. As Serena hits small balls into the crowd, presumably prior to signing some of those big ones they hand out, wrap-up in a mo. Williams 6-1, 6-3 Makarova* It\u2019s 0-15 on a Makarova error, then it\u2019s second serve and a point well won by Makarova for 15-all. Second serve again, and a rally ends with a dipping shot from Serena that Makarova cannot return coming to the net, because why not? Great winner, Serena stretched\u2026 it\u2019s 30-all. Makarova is fighting as hard as she can. But then she goes long, again, unforced and we have match point. Serena scrambles, makes a couple of tough returns and Makarova misses wide \u2013 that\u2019s your lot, in one hour exactly. Williams* 6-1, 5-3 Makarova Out to 15-0 with a serve that pushes Makarova too wide for a return. A missed toss in the wind. A short rally won with a dipping forehand right to left and just in: 30-0. Serena misses long, for 30-15, rather ruining my aim for a short, sharp way of describing a short, sharp, likely final game, dammit. To second serve next, Makarova returns it and in surprise Williams finds the net for 30-all. Another missed toss. And Williams misses long after a good return and it is break point: and Makarova returns and Williams finds the net. Swipe me. Makarova was told \u201cno coaches, please\u201d during the changeover. What could any coach possibly say in such a situation as this? Williams 6-1, 5-2 Makarova* Makarova serves to stay in the match, then, and gets to 15-0 on a Williams error of which, as we\u2019ve seen, there have been a few. And to 30-0 on another, another one long on the forehand. Williams gets her range back next, though, Makarova\u2019s legs practically buckling as she forces shots back from the baseline and eventually finds the net. Then she tries a drop shot from deep \u2013 nah. Serena tried that earlier, remember? Williams finds the net on a two-handed backhand, though, and it\u2019s 40-30\u2026 and the game as a return hits the net. Serena serves for the match next. Williams* 6-1, 5-1 Makarova Some aggression from Williams off the first serve, coming to the net though it isn\u2019t necessary, but then she goes long for 15-all. She sometimes wobbles, does Serena, in situations and positions like this. She puts the next one away, though, and shouts: \u201cCome on!\u201d She\u2019s not\u2026 dissatisfied, is she? How? Why? Delayed call of out on a Makarova winner \u2013 them\u2019s the breaks, obviously, in matches like this. Vast ace. Va-hast. Vaster than vast. This is very true. Williams 6-1, 4-1 Makarova* Unforced error from Makarova, and another \u2013 although that may have been a bit forced, as Serena forced her wide \u2013 and to second serve to avoid three break points\u2026 and she does with a beautifully played point and a joyously dispatched winner at the net, or coming to it. Second serve again, though, which is when the Jaws music starts playing\u2026 and the forehand return is just too strong. Double set point to set up the endgame. Makarova saves the first, with Williams unbalanced through the whole point. And the second \u2013 return of serve into the net. Deuce. And to game point for Makarova with a serve good enough that Williams cannot control the return. Game Makarova\u2026 Williams goes long. Williams* 6-1, 4-0 Makarova The first point, dismissively played, brings a squeak of disbelief from Makarova; the second point is an ace. Lovely rally next, unusually, but Serena wins it at the net on the volley and it\u2019s 40-0. Easy. I\u2019m not looking for any more Moore. This is not an occasion that invites levity, what with a respectable tennis pro being crushed before our eyes. It\u2019s 16-3 on winners to Serena. Williams 6-1, 3-0 Makarova* This is the Hobbesian match I expected from Murray when he played Haase on the first day: nasty, brutish and short. To recap, Hobbes the philosopher played tennis and then had vigorous rubdowns, in the belief it would help him live longer. Advice for Makarova? Possibly not. The Russian serves gamely enough to start and survives to 15-all, then keeps a rally going long enough to be able to hit one long when stretched to breaking point. And now at breaking point, Makarova long from the baseline under, relatively, little pressure. Dismissed. Williams* 6-1, 2-0 Makarova Williams has actually made more unforced errors coming into this game \u2013 in which 30-0 happens very quickly \u2013 but she has also played many, many more winners. Massive ace. In college slang, we\u2019d have called that \u201cmahoosive\u2019, which is bigger than massive. Massiver. Another one. Game. Williams 6-1, 1-0 Makarova* A rally, Makarova getting Serena moving, which is what she wants to do, but then the Russian finds the net; on the next point more of the same but then Makarova hits long. It\u2019s not like Serena actively needs the help. And she misses wide going ambitious again, and we have three break points. Already. Ace. Fair enough. To second serve on second break point \u2013 a baseline rally and Makarova finds the net. That last Graf/graft pun, I meant \u201cgraft\u201d in the British/Yorkshire sense, being \u201chard work, grit, determination\u201d, not the American sense, being \u201ccriminal, fraudulent, not nice\u201d. Just so we know. I may live in New Yorkshire, but I\u2019m from old. Which is nice for me. Williams* 6-1 Makarova It\u2019s 0-15 as Williams mis-hits one, then 15-all as Makarova can\u2019t return anywhere other than the left net-post. Makarova goes wide on a potentially suspect call, but doesn\u2019t challenge it. Then a second foot fault against Serena. Unusual. Crushing backhand sets up two set points, anyway. Makarova misses badly: set. Challenges the call anyway. Nope. Williams 5-1 Makarova* Big forehand winner from Serena from a weak-willed second serve opens the game, then tries it again but misses wide and that\u2019s about the best Makarova is going to get at the moment. She then misses a backhand wide, perhaps surprised to have the chance to hit it. And wide again after managing to get a Serena rocket back and working back into the rally. Double break point. Second serve it is\u2026 and a good point one by Makarova, though she had to scramble and at one point simply spooned one back and hoped for the best. Long next \u2013 5-1. Serena to serve for the first set. You mean Makarova is going to have to put in some hard Graf, John? You can have that one. For a headline, children\u2019s parties, your tax return. *Whatevs* John McEnerney, Twitter pundit to the stars and/or me, makes contact\u2026 Williams* 4-1 Makarova Rather a cruel first point, Makarova sprinting and returning well but Serena coming forward, confidently, and commanding the court. Next point she duffs a drop shot from the baseline \u2013 could\u2019ve told her that might happen. Honest I could. To 30-15 as Makarova finds the net. Big serve down the T, a ball person protecting his/her ball area from the marginal fault, and then a rally around the baselines and Serena hits long for 30-all. Makarova then gets a big serve back, with a kind of broadsword fend, but Serena has too much power in the rally. A second serve ace\u2026 it\u2019s challenged, though, and successfully. So there you go \u2013 deuce. To advantage with a rally in which Makarova is doing all the running, trying to move the ball about but, in the end, failing. Foot fault called there, I think\u2026 doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 astonishing forehand dipping winner down the right-hand tramlines. Williams 3-1 Makarova* That is a very, very soft second serve from Makarova \u2013 almost Murray-esque, he typed, sort of satirically. It is, we are told, a little gusty out on Arthur Ashe \u2013 it is/was/will be ever thus. Then 0-30 and maybe this is a Makarova wobble. Well, not yet, that was a Williams one, trying to run around a bigger serve \u2013 15-30. Long rally then won by a ripped, dipped forehand crosscourt winner from Williams. Two break points. Second serve, which can\u2019t be good for Makarova \u2013 no points yet won on it. Serena challenges the serve having gone long and it was barely good. So. Makarova long \u2013 break. I think I used that Brendan Foster Ekaterina Makarova post too early. Here\u2019s another: Williams* 2-1 Makarova Williams finds the net, perhaps surprised her 117mph first service came back. Then it\u2019s 15-all when a similar wallop in answer to a similar wallop flies wide; then 15-30 as Williams goes needlessly long. Easy point next for 30-all, then a massive ace, 116mph, and shortly after the game. Williams 1-1 Makarova* First service game for Makarova, with her Kevin Mitchell-endorsed lefty serve. Some cheers for her from the stands. Goes to 0-15 on a so-so rally and Makarova goes long, wide on a forehand; Serena finds the net from the baseline for 15-all; again for 30-15. Makarova is moving and hitting crisply here, and she goes to 40-15 after clipping the net. And then it\u2019s 40-30 with a mighty forehand service return winner from Serena. But then a bad mis-hit for Makarova\u2019s hold. Williams* 1-0 Makarova First point to second serve but a short rally is ended with a very stern forehand indeed from Williams. Ominous. But then the next rally is settled by an equally forthright backhand from Makarova. Huh. At 30-15 Serena dominates a point \u2013 big serve, to the net, dismissive forehand winner. The serve, indeed, is rumbling into gear quickly. Makarova misses a winner on the next point and we\u2019re done. Williams to serve, anyway. This is rather important news. Although slighly if not unpleasantly unsettling to me, for reasons\u2026 When American commentators should say \u201cbeating\u201d, as in \u201cin beating Bouchard, Makarova made us take notice\u201d, they say \u201ctaking out\u201d. \u201cWhen taking out Bouchard, Makarova made us reach for vaguely inappropriate militaristic language that at the very least seems more apt to apply to someone like Marshawn Lynch running at some Green Bay Packers.\u201d That kind of thing. You can tweet or email me, remember\u2026 @MartinPengelly or martin.pengelly@theguardian.com Umpire is Carlos Ramos, of Portugal. Neither of these two has lost a set yet, by the by. So we\u2019re in for a first, either which way. As the knock-up continues, a thought: is \u201cEkaterina Makarova\u201d the new name to be said in Brendan Foster\u2019s voice? This joke brought to American readers regardless of relative utility, utter unsuitability or complete impenetrability. Scoring system explained: Williams 0-0 Makarova* *denotes player serving in game described. Simple. Makarova, who has of course also reached the doubles final here: I\u2019m really enjoying to show my best tennis and I\u2019m excited about this match and enjoying this court. I need to play my best game. Serena: It means a lot to be here in New York. On Makarova: She\u2019s good, she does nothing bad, she moves well, she hits well, she serves well. So there you have it. Here\u2019s what Kevin had to say about that 2012 Australian Open game between these two, which Makarova won 6-2, 6-3. Within lies what Serena, then in something of a slump, had to say about it: She went for broke on a lot of her shots. I made 37 errors. That kind of tells the story of the match. \u201cIt was just disastrous. I served horrendous; that was one of the 50 things [that went wrong]. Every ball that came, I just hit it as far out as I could. But I feel like I definitely can play so much better. And that\u2019s good. Like, if I felt like I couldn\u2019t play better, then that would be a problem. It was hot that day in Melbourne, too. That\u2019s better. Or worse, for Serena. So there you are. Players on their way out shortly for what might not, after all, be quite such a foregone conclusion\u2026 This isn\u2019t it. Hang on\u2026 While I do, and appropriately apropos of nothing, you can read this obituary of Andrew McLagen, the storied director of westerns and war movies featuring John Wayne, James Stewart and the like who died on 30 August, which is since I last blogged the tennis, at the age of 94. Because this: The Sea Wolves (1980), another second world war action picture, was somewhat reminiscent of The Guns of Navarone (1961), the similarity emphasised by using the same leads, Gregory Peck (attempting a British accent) and David Niven. Also cast was Roger Moore, who had appeared, with Richard Burton and Richard Harris, in McLaglen\u2019s The Wild Geese (1978), about mercenaries in Africa. Ostensibly promoting racial understanding, the film was shot in South Africa at the height of apartheid. All of these rollicking adventures proved that, at the box office at least, familiarity breeds content. This has little to do with tennis, of course, and a lot to do with things I regularly put in tennis blogs because I can \u2026 unless I\u2019m trying to make a point about familiarity with Serena Williams breeding content. It is entirely possible that I might be trying to do this, as Williams is, at her best, as exhilarating to watch as Roger Moore orchestrating a bunch of oldies while they destroy a ship from which Nazis have been doing dastardly things out of a neutral port, the rotters. QED. Meanwhile, Serena Williams\u2026 She\u2019s attempting to win her 18th grand slam singles title, which would put her alongside Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova and four behind Steffi Graf on the all-time list. And on the road to that 18th title, she hasn\u2019t been troubled too much \u2013 Flavia Pennetta went 3-0 up in the first set of their quarter-final, which didn\u2019t come to anything for the Italian. After that, Williams said: I felt she was playing really well, I don\u2019t feel I was doing too much wrong. I just said to myself that if she keeps it up then she absolutely deserves the win and I just tried to do a little better. I had a lot of fun today, I really enjoyed it and I\u2019m so happy to have won. So much for drama. Here\u2019s another stat-slash-fact from the WTA: Makarova has one win over Williams at a grand slam, in the fourth round of the Australian Open in 2012, but only four players have ever scored more than one win over the WTA legend at a grand slam tournament (namely Venus Williams, Jennifer Capriati, Justine Henin and Samantha Stosur). I\u2019m going to hunt down our report of that Australian Open game. Maybe some video too. Shuai Peng has just been forced to retire, through injury \u2013 sending Caroline Wozniacki into her second US Open final. My colleague Tim Hill is covering that game, now story, here. Good afternoon from New York, where it is hot, close and uncomfortable \u2013 though perhaps not so hot, close and uncomfortable as things are likely about to be for Ekaterina Makarova, the surprise semi-finalist in the 2014 US Open women\u2019s singles. The Russian got here by beating a slightly injury-hampered Belarusian, Victoria Azarenka, 6-4, 6-2 in just under an hour and a half. After that match, she summed up her inexperience at this rarefied level thus: It\u2019s amazing. Finally I\u2019m in a semi-final after five chances before. Today it was a different feeling. I really wanted to move forward. And move forward she has \u2026 potentially straight into a very elegant, entirely awesome brick wall. That said, she did beat Williams at the Australian Open in 2012 and Guardian tennis correspondent Kevin Mitchell had this to say after Makarova\u2019s quarter-final here in New York: Makarova is resolute, one of the Tour\u2019s hardest off-court workers \u2026 [her] lefty serve up there with Petra Kvitova\u2019s when grooved. So \u2013 and she\u2019s also beaten Eugenie Bouchard here \u2013 it\u2019s not as if she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s more debatable whether I do in the current circs, so here\u2019s some stats culled from Makarova\u2019s official tour biography: Age: 26 Place of birth: Moscow World ranking: 18 US Open seeding: 17 And two statistical, fact-infused and palate-cleansing complimentary pre-moistened towelettes or wipes, as extracted from the same source: Makarova is 0-2 in her career against reigning World No1s, falling to [Justine] Henin in the third round of the 2007 US Open 6-0, 6-2, and to Williams in the second round in Dubai this year, 7-6, 6-0. Serena leads Makarova head-to-head, 3-1. Since losing to Makarova at the Aussie Open, Williams has beaten her in both of their meetings in straight sets, one of which was at the 2012 US Open. Have a look at the pair\u2019s full head-to-head details right here. I suggest you do so while I have a few thoughts about Serena, and a few less about ripping off Stephen Fry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
