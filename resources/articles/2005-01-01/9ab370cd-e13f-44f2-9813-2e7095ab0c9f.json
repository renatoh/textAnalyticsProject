In its ruling on L&amp;G's appeal against a \u00a31.1m fine for endowment mis-selling by the FSA, the tribunal revealed it had little known powers to recommend changes at the regulator if it was asked to do so by a \"third party\". L&amp;G admitted its board was \"looking at that course of action\", while also trying to have its \u00a32m legal costs repaid and its fine quashed after the tribunal ruled that the FSA had failed to prove widespread mis-selling. The tribunal did agree with the FSA that there had been problems with L&amp;G's procedures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
