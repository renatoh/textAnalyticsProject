Trump\u2019s hysterics, though, have blinded the mob. He may well \u201cget away with his crime\u201d of bribing Ukraine to investigate a rival. Yet US presidents and \u201cleaders around the world\u201d have long known that they \u201ccan get away with anything ... including murder on Fifth Avenue \u2013 and much worse\u201d. Millions upon millions of innocents throughout Latin America, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Iran and many others have long suffered from \u201ca US president being above the law\u201d. Trump\u2019s infantile tantrums and blundering bullying must seem laughable to those more accustomed to bombs or coups as presents from US presidents. Richard Abram Sydney, NSW, Australia Home delivery is a sign of our troubled times The tyranny of home delivery is creating a new class division. There are those who deliver the boxes and those who get the boxes (29 November). There are now millions employed delivering more stuff to more people more quickly than ever before. Wages and working conditions are rock bottom. Insecurity, stress, exploitation and alienation are sky high. Jeff Bezos, the boss of Amazon, has become the richest person on the planet. A fortune built on the labour of the boxetariat. Eliminating the last mile of the supply chain has become the new road to riches for the few and road to exhaustion for the many. Whether it will, in time, become a new foundation for worker activism and effective organising for better working conditions is both challenge and opportunity. Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia Tale of two photos exposes the real Johnson The two faces of Boris Johnson\u2019s hair (29 November) seem to reflect the gulf between leaving and remaining; but don\u2019t they have them the wrong way around? At the moment his hair looks free, exuberant and fecund (as a balding man I have an irrational desire to stand next to him in case the condition is catching), yet on the cover of his manifesto for a glorious Brexit future it looks flat, stale, weary and unprofitable (not necessarily in that order). S W Davey Torrens, ACT, Australia South Dakota tax haven is a troubling development The article by Oliver Bullough (22 November) on the emergence of South Dakota as a major tax haven is disturbing, especially as neighbouring North Dakota recently celebrated its 100th year of funding itself entirely debt-free from its own state bank, a fundamentally different approach to finance unmentioned in the article but recently mooted by the biggest state in the union, California, with others pending. The attraction of these havens is not just the secrecy demanded by clients, but the brazen cancellation of internationally accepted time limits on the trusts created. The whole business reeks of duplicity, and makes the careful lack of involvement by the Federal Reserve incomprehensible. It does, of course, raise the further question of why anyone should be liable for any tax at all when governments are so eager to allow tax havens in their jurisdictions. This matter is all part of the same mindset that accepts big donations to political parties as the logical way to fund them, while failing to address the insanely inaccurate voting system. Is there a disconnect here? Russ Vinden Errington, British Columbia, Canada We are all to blame as climate crisis worsens While fingers get pointed at oil companies and politicians for the climate crisis, could it be time that we look in a mirror while we are pointing? (18 October). Look at the cars travelling to work with big engines and one occupant or four-litre all-wheel-drives dropping kids off to school. How often do we think of fuel consumption when we buy the next car? Is the lawn mower powered by fossil fuels or electricity? And the ultimate abominations, jet skis and leaf blowers, burning fuel just because marketers are clever enough to make you think they are useful. We need to start looking at our own behaviour. When I look around me, nobody gives a damn about the climate crisis. Keith Edwards Omokoroa, New Zealand Political cartoons are being sorely missed here Like many other readers I continue to lament the disappearance of political cartoons from The Guardian Weekly. The Berger &amp; Wyse sketches on the Letters page are no substitute. Michael Neill Auckland, New Zealand"}, "isHosted": false}}}
