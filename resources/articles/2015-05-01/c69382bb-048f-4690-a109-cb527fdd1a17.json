Adam Brookman, a married father of five in his late 30s, is the real name of \u201cAbu Ibrahim\u201d, one of at least three Australians trying to negotiate their return home to Australia from the four-year Syrian conflict. Speaking in Turkey, Brookman told the Guardian he had been taken to Isis-held territory in Syria after being injured in an air strike and had been banned from leaving. \u201cIt was not permitted for foreigners to leave their areas to what [Isis] called apostate areas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to go to Turkey is also forbidden, they have an edict that basically forbids anyone from leaving their area.\u201d The Australian-born Muslim, whose interest in Islam was kindled during a gap year visit to Morocco, said he had never taken up arms with or joined Isis, and had only worked in clinics and hospitals in the war-torn country. He now wished to return to his wife and children in Melbourne, he said. Brookman told the Guardian he had entered Syria early in 2014 with the aid of an Australian humanitarian worker based in Turkey because he wanted to use his nursing skills to assist with the humanitarian crisis among the Syrian people. He eventually found his way to Aleppo, \u201cwhere I worked on ambulances, transporting civilians who were injured due to bombing and fire from jets, which would happen every night\u201d, he said. Fighting in Aleppo has been particularly fierce over the course of Syria\u2019s four-year civil war and the city is now divided between troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, Free Syrian army forces and Islamist groups. All have been accused of indiscriminate killing of civilians. Brookman said fighting in the city became so bad by June 2014 \u201cthat I was forced to go further west towards a place called Atme\u201d. \u201cThere we had less to do, but used to work with the refugees camps there delivering clothing, and also water transported from Turkey.\u201d He said he had linked up with other health workers, most of whom were Syrian but some were Europeans. \u201cThey were always Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for people who aren\u2019t Muslims. \u201cAt the time we were working in temporary clinics and living out of garages. We had to keep moving, if you stay in one place too long there\u2019s a risk of being targeted by the government, they have a habit of targeting hospitals, clinics and places of worship. About the time Islamic State declared it had formed a caliphate on 30 June last year, Brookman\u2019s clinic in Atme was bombed. \u201cOne of our colleagues was killed and myself and a couple of others were injured,\u201d he said. He claims to have sustained injuries to his shoulder and right foot and was struck in the head. He told the Guardian he had been taken by ambulance to al-Bab, an area controlled by Isis with a large hospital. \u201cIt was at night, we were taken at night by ambulance to a hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cI was unconscious at the time, but from what I was told we were taken to an area that was under Isis control.\u201d After a few days he was moved to a recovery house, where he said he began to understand it was assumed he would join the militant group. \u201cThey quite fully expected me to join with the group, being a Muslim and being a foreigner \u2026 The vast majority [of foreigners] who are there are fighters,\u201d he said. \u201c[Isis] don\u2019t put a gun to your head \u2026 and also the fact that I was injured meant they weren\u2019t pushing the fact, but their assumption was that when I recovered I would join them in some capacity,\u201d he said. Brookman maintains that after his recovery he never joined the group: \u201cI didn\u2019t do the training at all, I managed to avoid doing things like that by getting back into medical work. So they kind of left me alone. There are lots of refugees there and the city of al-Bab is subject to a lot of aerial bombardment in surrounding areas.\u201d He claimed he had felt under constant suspicion by Isis militants. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with some of their beliefs about who is and isn\u2019t Muslim, and that\u2019s quite a dangerous thought process to have,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one who\u2019s smart would voice such disagreements, because people like that are thrown in jail and subjected to vigorous questioning \u2026 they\u2019ll get quite physical. \u201cThere\u2019s also the fear of infiltration and spies, so anyone who wants to leave is basically assumed to be a spy, because to them, why would anyone want to leave?\u201d Witnessing atrocities under the group\u2019s rule convinced him \u201cthey are bad, there\u2019s no doubt about it\u201d, he said. \u201c[Isis is] quite vicious and cruel and they torture people, and there\u2019s a no-apologetic execution to what they do. If you\u2019re with them they\u2019re friendly but if you\u2019re against them it\u2019s fire and brimstone.\u201d He claims to have witnessed the aftermath of the crucifixion of an alleged Assad regime spy and the stoning of a couple accused of adultery. He said these punishments were in keeping with sharia law, \u201cwhich is something all Muslims want to have, but done correctly, not gangster-style\u201d. He said between August and December he resolved that \u201cas soon as I could get out of here, I would get out\u201d. A Syrian he trusted put him in touch with a human trafficker working out of Turkey, he said, and in late December he made a break for the Turkish border. \u201cI went to stay at a friend\u2019s house and, after two days, a taxi driver came. With a bit of negotiation, because they\u2019re understandably scared of being caught, he took me to a border village.\u201d Brookman and the driver dodged Isis patrols and drove to a farm straddling the border between Turkey and Syria, he claimed. \u201cAfter a 2km run across farmland and then over a barbed wire fence, I found myself in Turkey.\u201d He said his passport had been stolen earlier in 2014 and, in Turkey, he asked the Australian embassy for a replacement. \u201cInitially they said no problem \u2026 A few days later I got a call saying my passport\u2019s been cancelled, I\u2019ve been suspected of terrorism and this and that.\u201d Through his lawyer, Rob Stary, he had commenced negotiations with the Australian federal police to return home, he said. \u201cWe understand that, of course, I\u2019d have to be investigated, just by the very nature of where I\u2019ve been, but hoping that I wouldn\u2019t be arrested and thrown in jail before such an investigation could take place.\u201d He said the talks were ongoing but police had so far been adamant he would be arrested upon arriving in Australia. \u201cI never entered in any fighting, I never participated in any attacks of any sort,\u201d he said. \u201cThe role that I did was in my capacity as a nurse and medic and in dispensing clothing, water.\u201d Brookman admits he treated Isis fighters in the course of his work. \u201cWe work in a clinic and you help who comes in. I\u2019m not there to check IDs and see who I\u2019m helping and not helping. \u201cIf someone comes in injured you do what you do and then move on to the next patient.\u201d He said while Australia did not implement sharia law, \u201cit\u2019s also not a war-torn country and it\u2019s not divided by different sects and groups. I was born in Australia and grew up in Australia and it\u2019s my home\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect, but what country is?\u201d he said. He would \u201clook into\u201d working with young people to dissuade them from joining Isis upon his return, Brookman said. \u201cThere would be benefit in opening the eyes of some of the youth that are clouded by the glitz and glamour of jihad,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d tell them the reality, that it\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking, this utopia that people are making it out to be. They think that they\u2019re doing jihad against the Syrian regime but they could be fighting against other Muslims in certain areas. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of restrictions, you can\u2019t leave and there\u2019s that ever-present suspicion of everyone so you watch what you say, there\u2019s no freedom to question certain things. \u201cIf people want to help Syria, you go through proper channels, of charity groups that are helping the Syrians.\u201d The prime minister, Tony Abbott, said on Tuesday there would be no exceptions made for Australians seeking to return who were suspected of having joined Isis. \u201cA crime is a crime is a crime,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go abroad to break Australian law, if you go abroad to kill innocent people in the name of misguided fundamentalism and extremism, if you go abroad to become an Islamist killer, well, we are hardly going to welcome you back into this country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
