Here, twins Sari and Romy Lightman (formerly of electronic outfit Austra) translate that concept into a languid and mystical form of baroque folk pop that alternates between seducing and confounding the listener. Missoula resembles Joanna Newsom performing at David Lynch\u2019s Club Silencio, while opening track Dead Can Dance &amp; Neil Young manages to evoke both artists yet also finding room for a steelpan solo. That fondness for meshing together unlikely sounds can sometimes be Do Easy\u2019s undoing \u2013 witness the title track\u2019s unwise combination of skronking jazz sax and what sounds like the demo setting from a 1980s Casio keyboard \u2013 but when everything clicks into place, it\u2019s hypnotic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
