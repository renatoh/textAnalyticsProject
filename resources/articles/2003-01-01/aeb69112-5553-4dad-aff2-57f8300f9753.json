I don't like where the UK is at today but I don't think I would like where you would like to take us either. Perhaps I should consider emigration? Simon K Response from Kim Howells: Dear Simon, I am the last person you should ask to define an ideal version of British culture. I am Welsh, and from a very particular part of Wales, a place where a very urban culture fringes mountains and deserted areas. I have a different vision of what culture is from someone who might live in East London or in the Fens of Cambridgeshire. It's the lack of a coherent image of culture that I love about this country. Waves of immigration and generations of trading have brought unimaginable creative riches to our island, and long may it continue. What I object to is the condescending, do-gooding, middle-class refusal to criticise cultural manifestations that demean the communities associated with them. When I speak to teachers, they agree with me, that no child from any background - whether ethnic or financial - should somehow find encouragement to worship gun culture, misogyny, or violence. As a society , we should be aiming for something higher and more decent than that. There was unimaginable poverty in the 1920s and 30s in many parts of Britain, but there was never an attempt to extol the virtues of gun culture and violence, simply because people were poor. Instead they worked to change society politically, and they succeeded. Violence in urban music: Ethnicity no excuse for violent, misogynistic rap lyrics Question from ICharlie: Mr Howells, In regard to your comments about 'rap' music, could it not be argued that such remarks, rather than discouraging teenagers from listening to the 'gangsta' element, push those people towards it as they see it as rebellion, which many teenagers feel the need to do. Would it not be better to highlight 'rappers' with a positive message, such as Common, whilst also pointing out that many 'gangsta rappers' are generally people with little or no connection to the 'ghetto' lifestyle they portray. I would also argue that the emergence of 'gangsta rap' is a symptom of the times, where people are increasingly both materialistic, and individualistic. Response from Kim Howells: Dear ICharlie, Thanks for the opportunity to clarify my views on rap. I want to make it clear that it is not rap that I object to, but a small minority of lyrics in songs which glamorise violence, guns, and misogyny. I do not believe that listening to rap is capable turning otherwise peace-loving respectful individuals into gun-toting gangsters. If that was true then my generation would all be in jail, having been brought up on cowboy movies, some Peckinpah films and Clint Eastwood stroking very big guns. It is the notion that somehow we should ignore this amoral, violent and misogynistic content as, somehow, being perfectly legitimate because it happens to be produced by a particular ethnic culture. That is condescending in the extreme, and not something supported by the great majority of decent, respectable people within that minority who want their children to admire finer values and to aspire to something beyond the images romanticised in the worse of these lyrics. Licensing proposals: Not an attack on live music in churches Question from Stephenfollows: Dear Dr Howells, As a previous message has stated, your proposed licensing legislation will make live music in churches virtually impossible. The vast majority of church performances involve classical music. This is true both at the amateur level and at many of our international festivals, such as Aldeburgh, Bath and Spitalfields. Do you expect them to put their prices up to levels which only the very rich will be able to afford, or close down entirely, and make Britain a laughing stock around the world? At the same time, orchestras are finding their grants cut to lower and lower levels. Some like the City of Birmingham Symphony, one of the finest in Europe, have said that they may go bankrupt if the government's attitude does not change. Some of our best musicians, the most prominent being Sir Simon Rattle, have moved abroad, saying, in effect, that they find it impossible to function in a country which values serious music so little at the highest level. Why the sustained attack on classical music? It's probably too much to expect Tony Blair to trade in his electric guitar for a cello, but it would be good to see the government finally giving proper support, both financial and moral to people involved in the most profound and life-affirming forms of music-making - the antithesis of the rappers you rightly condemn. (And before you play the 'supporting the younger generation' card, I'm in my thirties and have been going to classical concerts for more than 20 years. The same is true of many people I know, not to mention the vast numbers passing through our youth orchestras and music colleges. The future looks pretty bleak for them, as things stand.) Response from KimHowells: Dear Stephen, The last thing I want to do is attack live music of any sort. The Bill will strengthen the numbers of live music venues around the country from churches to pubs. I fear that there has been a campaign of misinformation by certain elements of the musicians' union. It's a mystery to me why they have done this. But I hope that my recent statements have made people realise that the proposed changes will make it less expensive for real bands, choirs and orchestras to play at licensed premises than it is at the moment. This is a civilising Bill which will treat people like adults and recognise that venues should not be limited to two musicians in a bar. Violence in urban music: Foul language should not be admired or romanticised Question from Jigme31: I am concerned about the career of what I consider to be a great British film, Sweet Sixteen by Ken Loach which I saw recently in my local cinema... Toulouse, France. I have been informed that it received an 18 rating which removes the film from its natural audience and those most likely to benefit from seeing it - ie the under 18s - apparently it received this rating because of 'bad language' by the principle role!!! Have you seen the film? Do you think that it is right to censor what amounts to an educational film in this way? Response from Kim Howells: Dear Jigme31, I have not seen Sweet Sixteen by Ken Loach, but I will try to see it soon. I am not one of nature's censors, and I do not favour heavier censorship. I favour much more debate on the content and nature of film, television and video games, simply because they are such very important parts of our lives and we should be concerned about what constitutes \"normality\" as far as the cultural diet of our children is concerned. I thought that Lord Warner's description of the dangers inherent in a \"coarsening of our sensibilities\" was an interesting point of departure for such a debate. Ken Loach is a distinguished film-maker and has to make his own judgements about the nature of the dialogue and imagery in his movies. I think language does matter, and I am not in favour of encouraging the notion that foul language is something to be admired and adopted. I am not naive enough however to believe that the kind of language I understand to be in much of the dialogue of Sweet Sixteen is somehow exceptional. Unfortunately far too many of us use it far too often. What I do not want to do is see it used as an attempt to romanticise the cultural poverty of parts of our society. Licensing proposals: Maintaining the balance between the rights of revellers and local residents Question from Splorquot: Your Government's plans to license all public live entertainment have been dismissed as unjustifiable and a violation of the right to freedom of expression, according to the Commons Joint Committee on Human Rights. What is your response to this? Response from Kim Howells: Dear Splorquot, On the question of human rights, the Joint Committee on Human Rights has not said the Bill violates Article 10. It has simply asked us questions about the matter. Freedom of expression has to be balanced with another human right - the right of an individual to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions and life. In other words, the government has to balance the rights of more music making with more people wanting a quiet night in. The European Convention permits a balance in the public interest. If we are going to strengthen and create more venues for live music we cannot ignore the quality of life issue of those who reside close to those venues. We need to take them with us, not alienate them. Licensing proposals: Huge fines will only affect unscrupulous licensees Question from Etwigger: With all the problems of crime in England, why do you want to antagonise so many musicians by making it an offence punishable with a \u00a320,000 fine and or six months imprisonment for a pub to allow a Jazz or Folk session totally unamplified, unless it has a licence in advance? I thought you liked Jazz? I know you will say it will be easy to get a licence but it will not because locals will not understand and will object, and licensees will not want anyone to object their licence and will therefore not apply. Forty thousand plus musicians have signed the e-petition against this. Why on earth do you want to antagonise them so? All you need do is allow unamplified music as a standard term of a standard licence and leave it to the landlord. Limit it to 11pm if you wish. Response from Kim Howells: Dear Etwigger, I don't know who's been feeding you your information on the possible fate of jazz and folk musicians, but whoever it was was pulling your leg. The punishments you mention are reserved for unscrupulous licensees found guilty of blocking fire exits and such like. At the moment, if more than two musicians or singers perform in a licensed premises, they have to persuade the licensee to take out an entertainments license, which can cost in some areas, many thousands of pounds. Our new Bill will set the fee for a premises license (with or without music) at between \u00a3100 and \u00a3500, depending upon the size of the venue and location. That is a one-off cost for the lifetime of the premises. On top of that there will be an annual charge for inspection and enforcement of between \u00a350 and \u00a3150. There will only be one licensing authority, cutting out an enormous amount of needless bureaucracy and cost. It will not cost a licensee a penny more to stage music or other entertainment than it would cost him or her to take out a premises license. This will ensure that venues in the future will thrive not decline. Music piracy: Why Robbie should stick to singing Question from Ciapetti: Minister, As it is, it is hard enough to make ends meet as a professional singer, without Robbie Williams - snug with his \u00a380 million recording contract - telling his fans that music piracy is a \"great\" idea. Does the Minister share my concern with this statement? Does the statement not constitute an incitement to theft? What sentence does the Minister think is appropriate for Mr Williams? Response from Kim Howells: I'm appalled at Robbie Williams' statement. He has an \u00a380m contract and probably doesn't worry too much about all those singers, songwriters, musicians, and music publishers who depend entirely for a living on receiving honest revenue from sales of their product. Williams should not be defending theft, and this is real theft. It is the equivalent of going into a record store and shoplifting the material on sale. I hope that musicians everywhere will condemn his statement. He should also realise that many of these pirate operations are linked to organised crime on a worldwide basis. In saying that piracy is a \"great idea\", Williams is doing the work for international gangs involved in drugs and prostitution who find music piracy an excellent way of laundering their profits. The industry should ask him to think again, not least his publishers EMI, who are one of the leading companies in lobbying government to take stronger action against music pirates. Turner Prize: Open debate vital on visual arts to break critical monopoly of \"incestuous\" in-crowd Question from Steve Simpson: Your comments about last year's Turner prize contenders (\"If this is the best that British art can produce, it is lost. It is cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit\") left me wondering how you propose to get us out of this rut that you think we're in? What would you do to stem the flow of bullshit? Response from Kim Howells: Dear Steve, I suspect that the first thing we have to do is to drag this subject out into the open so that it is debated publicly and not regarded as the sole property of a tiny minority of the chattering classes. It is quite clear from the amount of mail that I've received that it is a subject a huge number of people feel passionately about. Time and again in letters people talked about the emperor's clothes, and how Turner must be spinning in his grave. The reasons for the art establishment's favouring of the kind of material that was on display in the Turner Prize shortlist are probably many and various. I suspect that they are mainly about the nature of the contemporary art market and about the kinds of things taught at art schools. We should be able to debate matters like these openly. There is also the eternal problem of the exclusivity of that self-appointed guard of public taste, our critics. They seem to hate it if anyone elbows into their home territory and attempts to discuss issues like this one in a language which most people speak. I sense that visual culture is too important to be left to an incestuous in-crowd. It needs a new critical language capable of smashing the precious glass display case around much of the establishment art currently on display."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
