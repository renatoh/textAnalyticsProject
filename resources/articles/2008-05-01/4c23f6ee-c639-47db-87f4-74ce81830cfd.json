My mum noticed brown patches on my skin and freckles under my arms. I had problems with coordination. I couldn't ride a bike and my speech was delayed. The skin specialist told my mum it was the same disease as the Elephant Man had had. She burst into tears. Primary school wasn't too bad. I was very small; at six, I was in age two trousers. But the other children treated me like a little brother. I couldn't write properly until I was seven. I felt as if I was always playing catch-up. One teacher used to keep me behind at break to finish my work. I don't think he really understood how hard it was for me. When I was seven, my leg started to go numb and kept giving way. I was diagnosed with epilepsy and put on medication. I found it difficult to concentrate. I couldn't even cross the road by myself. Mum says I used to walk into the middle of the road and just stand there. At 11, I started at a special school. They made me feel welcome there. For the first time I didn't feel different, I was just me. When I was 12, everything changed. They told me my doctor had got it wrong; I didn't have epilepsy. It was a shock. It took a few days for it to sink in. I suffered some brain damage from the drugs; my speech is affected and my memory. I'm just glad they found out. At primary school the teachers said I'd never even get one GCSE. I ended up getting nine. They said I wouldn't get a job, but now I work at Sainsbury's. I'm 18 now and life has improved a lot. I'm at college and I've got a part-time job. I travel by myself to college. I play sport now and teach at a youth club once a month. I'm studying sports leadership because I'd like to become a lifeguard. If you'd told my mum 10 years ago that I'd be doing all this, I don't think she would have believed you. \u00b7 Carl Tansur is studying NVQ Level 1 in sports leadership at Leicester College"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
