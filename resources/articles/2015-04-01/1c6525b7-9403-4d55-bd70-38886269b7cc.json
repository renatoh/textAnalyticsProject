The announcement comes as part of a package of measures in the party\u2019s countryside charter, to be unveiled on Tuesday, which commits the Lib Dems to \u201cclosing the gap\u201d between rural and urban areas in the availability of high-speed broadband and extending the 5p per litre discount on fuel to more remote areas. Residents across 17 of the UK\u2019s most rural areas with the highest fuel prices would start to get the discount from 31 May. The party leader, Nick Clegg, will set out the plans to help rural communities on a trip to a fishing market in Newlyn Harbour in Cornwall, in the marginal Lib Dem constituency of St Ives, which is held by Andrew George with a 3.74% majority. The visit comes a day after the Guardian reported comments by George that the Lib Dems would not go into a coalition with the Tories. Clegg said: \u201cAndrew is one voice but he doesn\u2019t represent the Liberal Democrat stance on this. Nor is it his decision. He\u2019s entirely entitled to his own view. I lead a political party, not a sect. And if and when we need to make a decision we\u2019ll take a decision collectively.\u201d The deputy prime minister is expected to say that the rural economy is worth \u00a3210bn to the UK and that his party wants to \u201cunlock its potential\u201d. He will say: \u201cIn order to prosper, rural areas need good local services, appropriate infrastructure and more housing.\u201d A spokesperson for the party denied that the plans to give local authorities powers to raise council tax for second homes was an attack on those with holiday homes, arguing that local government in areas popular with second home owners had been crying out for such a measure for years. Cornwall has the greatest number of second homes in England and Wales \u2013 about 5% of its 260,000 houses \u2013 and prices have risen over the past decade at an above-average rate, leading some to argue that second home purchases have created a local housing bubble. In 2012, Cornwall county council became the first local authority to abolish council tax discounts for holiday homes and introduce a 150% tax on properties left empty for two years. Also included in the Lib Dems\u2019 countryside charter is a pledge to roll out high-speed broadband to 99.9% of households across the UK and plans to increase the powers of the groceries code adjudicator so that all farmers, especially in the dairy industry, are paid fairly. The party wants to introduce a rural bus protection fund to maintain transport services that are not necessarily profitable but are relied upon by those living in remote areas. It also plan to introduce \u201cretained\u201d police officers, who are fully-trained police officers on call and able to respond quickly where needed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
