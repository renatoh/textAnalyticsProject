Avastin, a drug currently used to treat bowel cancer, has been found to make some breast cancers more manageable in the long term. Professor David Miles, of the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, and Professor Mitch Dowsett, of the Breakthrough Research Centre, will describe how the drug can 'target' not just the cancerous tumour but also the processes feeding it by, for example, stopping the blood supply around the tumour which it needs in order to grow. The breakthrough has been hailed as the first in a wave of new 'targeted' treatment agents which could bring hope to cancer sufferers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
