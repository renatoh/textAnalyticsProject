The predominantly black contributors include artists from the Windrush generation such as Denzil Forrester, whose paintings portray life in 80s London, to Steve McQueen, Betye Saar, Zadie Smith and seminal music producer Dennis Bovell. The young talent featured includes photographer Rhea Storr, whose work looks at mixed-race identity growing up in Yorkshire; Scots band Young Fathers; fashion designers Martine Rose and Grace Wales Bonner; and Jenn Nkiru, who worked on Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s Ape Shit video. It all begins with Zak\u2019s father, Horace Ov\u00e9, who was the first black British person to direct a feature film, 1975\u2019s Pressure, about a black British teenager and the racism he experiences. Zak hopes this exhibition \u2013 which includes some work never seen by the public before \u2013 will provide a reassessment of his father\u2019s legacy. \u201cI\u2019m really excited that the public will be able to see my father\u2019s work again or perhaps discover it,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was such a pioneer of his time.\u201d The fact that Ov\u00e9 is not more widely known is symptomatic of the endemic lack of diversity in the arts, something that may now be changing. This exhibition follows Tate Modern\u2019s Soul of a Nation last year, about art in the United States\u2019s \u201cblack power\u201d era, and Wales Bonner\u2019s A Time for New Dreams showcase at the Serpentine Sackler gallery in January, which featured the work of black creatives including Liz Johnson Artur and Ben Okri. Forrester, who began making art in the mid-1970s, acknowledges that there has been a shift from his experience as a young artist. \u201cWhen I was a student at Central Art School and the Royal College of Art, there were no black students in my year, and few black artists in the college as a whole,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was also no evidence of black artists in commercial galleries. This is beginning to change.\u201d Music has been a world where black British artists have had more freedom. Producer Bovell is contributing pieces he has collected over a 45-year career, working with the Slits, Janet Kay and poet Linton Kwesi Johnson. He says that working on the exhibition made him reassess his achievements. \u201cIt made me think about how important my work is and what a journey I have had,\u201d he says, \u201cand it made me think that everything I have done is good.\u201d Bovell was born in Barbados in 1953 when it was still a British colony, but settled in London, making music from the late 60s. \u201cThe expression of black Britishness is seen in many walks of life,\u201d he says. \u201cI am one of the statistics that made something of the last 40 years.\u201d Bovell is curious about the next generation in his lineage. \u201cThere are some exciting youngsters coming through,\u201d he says. \u201cI can only been proud to think that I\u2019m maybe one of the giants upon whose shoulders they stand.\u201d With so many contributors, there is space for myriad expressions of black Britishness. Ajamu provides a different point of view. The photographer is best known for his Fierce series, portraits of \u201cyoung LGBT people from second-generation black British backgrounds, and those born and raised in the Caribbean and Africa\u201d. He says: \u201cBlack British identity is multidimensional. It\u2019s not just about the usual suspects: race, sexuality and gender. It\u2019s place, class and much more besides. I was born and raised in Huddersfield; that would be a very different experience from Halifax, Leeds or Dewsbury.\u201d Ajamu has shown his Fierce images in London\u2019s 800-year-old Guildhall. \u201cIt is an amazing space, with pre-Raphaelite paintings everywhere, very British,\u201d he says. \u201cThis puts young black and brown people, not generally seen as part of that conversation, in the dialogue.\u201d Arguably, this exhibition\u2019s Somerset House venue, another rarified address, has a similar resonance. \u201cThis exhibition reflects unadulterated black pride,\u201d says Ov\u00e9, \u201cwith the freedom to fill in all the blanks, where we didn\u2019t exist before.\u201d Get Up, Stand Up Now is at Somerset House, WC2, Wednesday 12 June to 15 September"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
