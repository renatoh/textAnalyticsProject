A weather report from Hobart, Tasmania. A host debating the dangers of gambling with late-night callers in Las Vegas. An ad for a gas station near Anchorage, Alaska \u2013 lowest price guaranteed, you betcha. Such is the array of choice that satellite radio offers the curious listener. Some may remember the child-like astonishment that came with sending their very first email, connecting instantly with a faraway recipient. Listening to a remote radio station produces the same sense of marvel by allowing us to peek into the daily rhythm of distant places, from rural communities to megalopolises. If the internet is responsible for creating a global homogeneous culture, then with local broadcasting the world grows smaller and smaller. Sure, Radio 4 in the background provides a homely sustenance; but there's an entire world out there to listen to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
