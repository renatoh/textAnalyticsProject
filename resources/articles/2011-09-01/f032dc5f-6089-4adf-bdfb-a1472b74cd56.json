The investors, with the support of the Prince of Wales and several leading business figures, have set out a new set of guidelines they hope will lead to more stringent rules that companies will follow \u2013 voluntarily, at least at first. Their aim is to encourage companies to link their environmental and financial performance, in order to gain more support for sustainability measures such as carbon reduction. Sir Michael Peat, former private secretary to Prince Charles and chairman of the International Integrated Reporting Committee, which produced the discussion paper, said: \"The range of issues \u2013 economic, environmental and social \u2013 which determine an organisation's success has never been broader or more pressing. It is for this reason that we need an approach to reporting that is fit-for-purpose in the 21st century. The world has changed \u2013 reporting must too.\" At present, most large companies in the UK report some aspects of their environmental performance, such as their carbon dioxide emissions. However, the same is not true in other countries and the standards by which companies make their reports vary widely. There are different ways of assessing greenhouse gas emissions, for example, and some companies report on the use of other resources such as water while others do not. The new concept of \"integrated reporting\" on which today's discussion document is based requires companies not only to disclose their environmental and social impacts, but to relate them to current and future economic performance. Investors should be able to gain a clearer picture of a company's risks and opportunities, encouraging companies to improve sustainability. The guidelines lay out how these should be assessed and suggest a new, user-friendly format in which they can be presented. Sir Michael said: \"All matters which are important in assessing an organisation's performance and position, past and prospective, need to be reported but not by making annual reports ever longer and more complex \u2013 they are too long already. The information needs to be provided clearly and concisely with the connections between financial, environmental and social impacts demonstrated and the clutter removed.\" The discussion paper will now be examined by investor groups, businesses and regulators, and distilled into a set of concrete proposals for reporting guidelines. A pilot programme will allow companies to road test the ideas. Companies will then be invited to sign up to follow the finished guidelines voluntarily, in the hope they will become an international standard companies adhere to as a matter of course."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
