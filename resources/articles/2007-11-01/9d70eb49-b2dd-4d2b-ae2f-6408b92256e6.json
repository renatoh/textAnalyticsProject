That 'hysterical realism', the tendency in contemporary fiction so accurately diagnosed by critic James Wood in 2001 - symptoms include fact fetishism, list making, digressive mini-essays - has mercifully given way to something more intelligent and true. Last, that fiction rarely awards first prize to youth. The standout story here is the beautiful 'Donal Webster' ... It's by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, who at 52 is the oldest writer between these covers.\" \"There's a playfulness about many of the contributions,\" said Sophie Harrison in the Sunday Times. Smith's own contribution is \"a novel compressed; after reading it, it grows in your head, like those Chinese paper flowers that quadruple when dropped in a bowl of water\". \"The short story is still in crisis,\" concluded Nicholas Royle in the Independent. \"Anthologies such as The Book of Other People, in which, for the most part, first-rank contemporary authors unload second-rate stuff, do not help.\" \"Anger has certainly given her prose dynamism and momentum,\" observed Isabella Thomas in the Sunday Times, reviewing Rape: A History from 1860 to the Present by Joanna Bourke. \"She applies a crusading passion to her scrutiny of the appalling miscarriages of justice relating to her subject over the centuries.\" \"Bourke positions herself in respectful opposition to Susan Brownmiller, whose polemic Against Our Will (1975) defined rape as the means by which all men intimidate all women,\" said Claudia FitzHerbert in the Daily Telegraph, \"while using statistics to suggest that we are further than ever from dealing with the problem of sexual violence, in respect of either prevention or cure.\" \"Respect for Roman male achievements does not figure in her index,\" grumbled Frederic Raphael in the Spectator, reviewing Mary Beard's The Roman Triumph. \"While she is very good on the way in which the triumph became showbiz and ... prefigured the modern spin-doctored Historical Event, her refusal to be impressed becomes itself triumphant ... If only her prose marched with a classier step ... how wholeheartedly she might be cheered on her way! As it is, one tribune at least feels obliged to remain seated.\" \"Beard sometimes protests a little too much that, beneath all their militaristic vainglory, the Romans shared the same concerns as we do,\" wrote Christopher Hart in the Independent on Sunday. \"Even in the pages of such humane writers as Seneca and Cicero, modern, liberal anxieties are hard to find. Beard wants to show that revulsion against violence is a human universal, but alas, she doesn't quite succeed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
