As originally reported by BuzzFeed, Maria Tusken\u2019s Instagram blew up after she released a new line of skeins called \u201cthe Polarized Knits collection\u201d on Wednesday. The dyed wools had names such as \u201cMicro-aggression\u201d, \u201cGaslight\u201d and \u201cEm-ocean-al labor\u201d. \u201cWill you be donating any of the proceeds to any of the marginalized communities that this language and attitude harms?\u201d wrote one angry follower. Another accused Tusken of bullying, saying: \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out how a woman co-opting words that are meant to protect marginalized folks is not bullying???\u201d Now, there is some context to this latest kerfuffle. While many of us don\u2019t wake up every day wishing the world of knitfluencers was more diverse, people have been talking about racism in the knitting community for some time. Tusken herself was pushed to the forefront of this debate last year, when she defended another knitfluencer who drew ire after going to India and blogging about her \u201cyear of color\u201d (yikes). Tusken took a break from Instagram and posted a YouTube video about how concern over \u201ca very intense social justice issue\u201d (read: racism) had \u201cstarted infiltrating Instagram\u201d. But her standing up for the \u201csilent majority\u201d of knitters who didn\u2019t think racism was a problem didn\u2019t go down that well: Tusken was accused of white fragility. It seems the Polarized Knits collection is her answer to this beef. Some have accused her Instagram page \u2013 which is largely innocuous, featuring shots of poetry, brightly colored yarn, and poetry books \u2013has been called an \u201cunsafe space\u201d, according to BuzzFeed. This may have something to do with the fact that her new collection is a collaboration with a YouTube channel called Unsafe Space, which spends its time winding up liberals \u2013 and to be honest, it looks like it is working. There have been other complaints about Tusken, too: she blogs about Jordan Peterson and says climate change can be solved on an individual level. But honestly \u2013 isn\u2019t this the worst story about the internet you\u2019ve ever heard? Don\u2019t we all have better things to be doing with our time? Or, as one of Tusken\u2019s 12,000 followers put it: \u201cWho knew yarn was so dangerous? \ud83d\ude02\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
