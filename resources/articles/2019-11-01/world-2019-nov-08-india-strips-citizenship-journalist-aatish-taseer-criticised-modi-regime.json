Aatish Taseer, who was born in the UK but raised in India and spent a further decade living there from the age of 25, was stripped of his overseas citizenship of India (OCI) status on Thursday. Taseer, who has written multiple books on India, described the government\u2019s move as \u201chighly suspicious and systematic\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are making an example of me and sending a warning message to other journalists.\u201d The decision followed the publication of his cover piece for Time magazine in May, just before the Indian elections, titled India\u2019s divider in chief, which was highly critical of Modi\u2019s actions while in power. \u201cWithin India, the Modi government has completely altered the media climate, everyone critical has been muffled or silenced,\u201d said Taseer. \u201cAnd now my case shows that even those who think they are protected because they write abroad or for a foreign publisher, they are not going to be safe either.\u201d The decision to remove his OCI means he is blacklisted from India and may never be able to return. \u201cMy work is so immersed in Indian life so there is a real pain as a writer, not being able to ever be in contact with this material again,\u201d said Taseer. \u201cAnd the other kind of pain is very personal. My mother who is 70 lives there. My grandmother who raised me lives there and she is 90 next year. Even if I take this to court, it is unlikely I will ever be able to see her again and for me that is the hardest part of all.\u201d The reason given by the home ministry for its action was that Taseer had \u201cconcealed the fact that his late father was of Pakistani origin\u201d and was therefore ineligible for OCI status. But Taseer denied this, saying his connection to Pakistan had never been hidden and had simply made him an \u201ceasy target\u201d. He was not given official written notice that he had been stripped of his OCI status and instead found out via a public tweet from the ministry on Thursday. Taseer\u2019s father is Salman Taseer, a Pakistani born in pre-partition British India who later held the position of governor of Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province until his assassination in 2011 for opposing the country\u2019s blasphemy laws. Growing up, Taseer had no connection to his father at all and his mother, a prominent journalist, was his sole legal guardian. Nonetheless, Taseer\u2019s father had been clearly named on all his official documentation registering his status as an Indian citizen, first in 2000 when he received his person of Indian origin status, and again in 2016 when it was transferred to OCI status \u201cwithout any issue\u201d. \u201cI never had any problems with my citizenship until after the Time piece was written,\u201d said Taseer. \u201cThere have been a number of times where my father\u2019s Pakistani nationality has been as clear as day. I wrote a book on discovering him aged 21. He was assassinated in 2011 and it was a major story across the world. Everyone knew he was my father, that there was this connection, and not once did anyone in the government raise a question about my OCI status. But within 90 days of that Time story, suddenly it gets raised.\u201d In September Taseer received a letter saying the government was taking action against him for allegedly defrauding the home ministry and his OCI status was under review. It followed an alleged smear campaign against him in India led by Sambit Patra, the spokesperson for Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party, and which was then picked up by Modi himself after the publication of the Time magazine article, where Taseer was repeatedly described as having an anti-India agenda due to his \u201cPakistani political family\u201d background. In a tweet on Thursday before declaring his OCI status had been stripped, the home ministry claimed Taseer had not asserted his right to appeal, which he also said was untrue. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said Taseer\u2019s fate showed that Modi\u2019s governing party was intolerant of criticism and freedom of the press. Under Modi, in power since 2014, India has fallen to 140th out of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Pen America, which defends freedom of expression, said: \u201cHarassing critical writers and journalists not just in India but globally is a disturbing new low for Modi\u2019s government that\u2019s already put Indian democracy on its heels.\u201d Taseer said he was fearful he was only the first to be targeted by the regime, and that OCI status would now be used as a sword of damocles to target Indian journalists writing internationally. \u201cThere are a lot of journalists who, like me, rely on this as a foundational document to connect them to their country, to own land, to visit family, to live in India as long as you like,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, anyone in a similar situation to me knows they are on notice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
