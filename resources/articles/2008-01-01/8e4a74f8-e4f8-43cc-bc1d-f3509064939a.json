So a reassessment must not only reinterpret what is already known; it must remake the case for general readers almost from scratch. Given the scale of her task, Anna Beer does a thoroughly decent job: she's realistic about the difficulties (particularly of making Milton-at-home likeable or even vivid, since no family portraits or letters survive), nimble in her combination of political background with personal foreground (especially during and after the civil war) and conscientious in her retrieval of remoter pleasures in the text (especially from those Latin poems). All these things will keep Milton scholars happy, and serve as a reliable guide to non-specialists. Whether they will do much to win Milton the larger audience he deserves is another matter. Beer's attempts to introduce more dramatic kinds of interest - such as the nature of Milton's relationship with the friend who dominated the early part of his life, Charles Diodati - are pretty wooden, and her critical prose tends to be careful rather than inspiring. We register Milton's authority in her book, but we seldom feel the blaze of his genius, or the pulse of his intensely complicated desires. This is not entirely Beer's fault. From the start of Milton's story, the dearth of intimate details make everything seem at one remove: the scrivener father who renounced his Catholic inheritance and pursued a sober life of money-making and social advancement; the invisible mother; the son whose prodigious intelligence and enormous capacity for hard work took him in easy strides from St Paul's school in London to Cambridge. By the time Milton starts his university life the pattern seems set: what is undoubtedly driven and exceptional about him also feels cold and automated and the material to make him feel otherwise just doesn't exist. Why was he rusticated in 1627, when he was 18? What were his ambitions? There are no clues - beyond a fierce sense of mission which survives into later poems such as the sonnet \"How soon hath time ...\" Was he in love with Diodati in ways that we can recognise today? It's extremely difficult to be sure - though there's plenty of evidence to suggest that he was deeply troubled by questions of his own effeminacy, repelled by the idea of sex with women and generally anxious to keep women at a distance and subjugated. Milton's life after Cambridge doesn't have a much sharper focus. He may have admitted that he felt \"something suspicious of myself, and do take notice of a certain belatedness in me\", but his first major commission, the masque commonly known as Comus, was hardly likely to further his career in any rapid or dynamic ways. The celebrations of virginity might have had a certain decorous appeal to potential aristocratic backers, but the frankly terrified attitude to sexuality was another matter - it was too intense, too manifest. Perhaps not surprisingly, Milton's next significant piece of writing, the elegy \"Lycidas\", originated within his former university rather than the wide world; not surprisingly either, given his emerging reputation as an awkward customer, it was distinguished and in important ways defined by unpredictable elements - in this case, a critique of contemporary religious corruption. None of this did much to settle the question of \"belatedness\". All we can say for sure is that in the late 1630s Milton \"almost single-handedly created the identity of the writer as a political activist, [and] of writing as a political vocation\" - developing his remarks in \"Lycidas\" into a fully armed assault on church corruption, and then adding a pamphlet on divorce which immediately became (and to some extent remains) notorious for its insistence that \"meet and happy conversation\" rather than sexual fidelity be the foundation of a good marriage. Beer's readers will be grateful for her intelligent appraisal of these tracts. She also does well - especially in her reading of Areopagitica - to demonstrate Milton's insistence that people confront rather than deny the mixture of good and evil in their experience. This both allows us to hear the heartbeat of the author and to track a steady path through what might otherwise seem a bewildering variety of work, as he advances towards his greatest achievement - Paradise Lost, which was published in 1667. It is all the more welcome in biographical terms since the background to the writing - Milton's first marriage, his separation from his wife, their reunion, the birth of his daughters, his wife's death, his infant son's death, his second marriage and this wife's death after less than two years, his deepening blindness, his third marriage - has to be treated in a series of sketches. Nothing but the bare facts survive. It's tempting to feel they are more than made up for by the wealth of facts about the operations of Milton's public life - his devotion to the parliamentary cause in general, and his work for Cromwell as the Secretary for Foreign Tongues in particular - and even if they can't generate the warmth of a domestic portrait, they certainly grip and impress. And when the Commonwealth finally collapsed, instead of running abroad or recanting like many of his former associates, he stood his ground and kept the faith. Chilly he might have been, unfortunate we may be in having so little personal evidence to moderate the image of a rigorously dynamic word-machine, but there's no doubting the heroism of his hard work, of his truth to himself, and of the liberal instincts which shaped most aspects of that self. What is less clear, until it puts forth its gorgeous evidence in the last part of his life, is the extent to which Milton's early abilities to mix rational intelligence with symbolic power had survived this long middle of his career. But Paradise Lost, and to a different extent Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes, prove that this aspect of his genius had not simply been protected during his poetic silence, it had radically matured. There is no great climax of public approbation to Beer's book, no softened rehabilitation, and no evidence of eventual domestic harmony. There is just the great poem, with its peerless combinations of imaginative reach and political analysis, its profoundly subtle enquiries into the nature of our relationship with the divine, its marvellous organ-blast hymn to (and the plea for vigilant support of) liberty. It's a crucial part of the biographer's job to lead readers back through the life to the work. Beer does this very steadily and very well, and thereby gives Milton the anniversary present he deserves. \u00b7 Andrew Motion is poet laureate"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
