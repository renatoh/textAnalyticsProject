Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, told MPs that he would refer the bid to the Competition Commission around 30 minutes after he was notified by News Corp that it was withdrawing an offer to spin off Sky News. The move by News Corp, which triggered an automatic referral, was widely seen as an attempt by Murdoch to buy time in the hope that the furore over phone hacking will have subsided by the time the Competition Commission completes its fresh inquiry in six months' time. The prime minister indicated that the government's patience with News Corp is wearing thin when he suggested that it should sort out its \"mess\" before embarking on the BSkyB bid. In a marked change of tone, hours after Downing Street said it would be wrong for the prime minister to express a view on the bid, Cameron said: \"All I would say is this: if I was running that company right now, with all the problems and the difficulties and the mess frankly that there is, I think they should be focused on clearing those up rather than on the next corporate move. That is the view I would take if I was running that company. But what government has to do is follow all the correct procedures and processes and that is exactly what we will do.\" The prime minister had no knowledge of the News Corp announcement and Hunt's decision to refer the bid to the Competition Commission when he made his remarks after a speech on public service reform at Canary Wharf. The news had been texted to a Downing Street aide at Canary Wharf who decided not to interrupt the prime minister. The Competition Commission now has the option to either clear or block the proposed takeover, or to propose remedies that would ease concerns about \"media plurality\". By opting to have the bid examined by the commission, News Corp loses control of determining its potential concessions; previously the company had, in effect, offered to spin off Sky News on a take it or leave it basis. News Corp insiders said that while it had hoped to avoid a referral to the Competition Commission, its efforts had \"clearly failed\" and that the greater riskiness of going to the commission was worth it because the regulator would focus on issues of \"media plurality\" \u2013 which means it would not take into consideration the impact of any further disclosures as regards phone hacking. Hunt made it clear that the government is rapidly cooling on the bid when he responded favourably to MPs from all sides who criticised News Corp. When Tom Watson, the Labour MP who has campaigned on phone hacking for the past two years, warned of \"institutional criminality at News International\", Hunt commended him for his \"tenacious campaign\". Eleanor Laing, a senior Tory, said that Murdoch would withdraw the bid \"if he had any decency\". Hunt replied: \"I completely understand the horror [with] which many people view the thought of a company allegedly responsible for these appalling actions taking over what would become Britain's biggest media company. So I completely understand where the public are on that. We now have a lengthy process that will get to the bottom of the media plurality issues. If any of the appalling events that have come up in the past week are linked to media plurality I am sure they will be considered in their entirety.\" Hunt indicated that he is likely to take his time in reaching a decision after the Competition Commission completes its new inquiry in six months. He indicated that he would stretch out the process after Jo Swinson, a Liberal Democrat MP, raised concerns about the \"criminal and unethical behaviour of Murdoch's News International\", asking Hunt to delay any decision until after the police complete their criminal investigations. Hunt said: \"I am not legally allowed to put a pause in this process until any criminal proceedings have come to a conclusion. However I will take as much time as I need.I am very well aware of public concern on this issue. The competition commission will report in six months' time. There will then be a subsequent period of intensive decisions. During that period I am very hopeful that we will properly resolve the fit and proper person issue because I am aware of how important the issue is to people on all sides of the house.\" Ministers changed tack after Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg called on Murdoch to abandon his bid to take control of the 61% of BSkyB that News Corp does not control. Clegg said after meeting the family of Milly Dowler, whose phone was allegedly hacked by the News of the World, that Murdoch should \"do the decent and sensible thing\" and think again about the BSkyB bid. Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, said that it was official party policy to oppose the bid. Miliband said that Murdoch should \"drop the bid for BSkyB\", which he said was \"untenable\" in the light of phone-hacking allegations. The Labour leader, who took the rare step of responding to Hunt's statement, is demanding that the government gives an undertaking that its decision on BSkyB will be delayed until after the police complete their investigation into phone hacking. If the government fails to offer such a undertaking Miliband will press ahead with plans to hold a commons debate on the bid on Wednesday. Peter Mandelson has intervened in the hacking debate, saying Labour was wrong not to challenge the press. In a Guardian article, the former business secretary writes: \"We simply chose to be cowed because we were too fearful to do otherwise. And David Cameron took up where Tony Blair and Gordon Brown left off. It has taken the News International crisis for politicians to discover their courage. Now they have to ensure that it is not primarily they who are protected from the \"feral beast\", but the public.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
