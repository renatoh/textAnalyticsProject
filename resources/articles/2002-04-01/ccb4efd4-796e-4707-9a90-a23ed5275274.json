Bosnich, who failed to establish himself under Ferguson and is currently third choice at Chelsea, praised the United manager's powers of motivation but suggested his success has to be seen in the context of the raw materials available to him at Old Trafford. \"His tactical acumen is negligible,\" Bosnich said. \"What he can do is spot a player a mile off and motivate people very well. He has the might of Manchester United behind him to do that but there's no doubt he's a man motivator.
