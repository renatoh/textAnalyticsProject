The scheme, which fast-tracked high quality candidates into non-clinical NHS roles, targeted graduates across the UK in a series of adverts. After discovering that large numbers of graduates are not following their preferred career options because of rising unemployment, we wanted to encourage them and at the same time improve the overall quality of the workforce. But the problems we are having in getting staff aren't just about a lack of opportunity. Mental health is often seen as the poor relation of the National Health Service, and project budgets tend to be smaller. In addition, the stigma mental health still has means the service often struggles to fill vacancies, irrespective of the ups and downs of the job market. This is best illustrated in the current shortage of psychotherapists and psychiatrists, despite average salaries of \u00a343,000 and \u00a353,000 respectively. An additional hurdle facing those wanting to pursue a clinical career in mental health is the need to be professionally registered. This involves several years of practical work experience, additional training, qualifications and proof of professional competence. We also worked with our counterparts in Camden and Islington, who have also been trying to solve their own staffing dilemmas. \"Some people have odd notions about mental health. They sometimes feel awkward, ill at ease or even fearful around individuals with mental health problems,\" says Michael Benson, the pilot's project leader. \"It's a mirror a lot of us don't want to look into and our reference points are often negative and misinformed. Mental health is increasingly impacting on everyone's lives whether personally or through someone we know and thankfully, perceptions are changing. One in four people will suffer poor mental health during our lives and the dramatic rise in conditions like dementia means most of us know someone with a mental illness. That familiarity, however painful, can only help raise awareness and break barriers down,\" Benson said. Sixty graduates with science and health degrees signed up for our scheme and have recently completed a one-year placement which involved working three days a week in the trust, and spending two days at Middlesex University studying for a postgraduate diploma in mental health. Initially 22 of the 60 graduates then progressed from a band three to band four pay scale on being offered full-time positions. One 25-year-old graduate, Richard Hazlett, signed up for the scheme after completing a three-year course in herbal medicine in an effort to strengthen his application for medical school. Hazlett had been trying to work his way into medical school via a different route after failing to get the grades that he needed at school. Hazlett explained why he wanted to be involved: \"I was interested in this area of the NHS because my brother suffered a bout of mental illness when he was younger. You are closely mentored to start with and work in various areas of the trust to gain a wide experience base. I eventually settled with the early intervention team who deal with psychosis like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia at St Ann's Hospital in Tottenham. The work is rewarding because you are working one-to-one with people and I now have my own caseload.\" I have managed some of the graduates through the process, and Richard had the right stuff from the start. All the graduates have shown good verbal and written skills, have been culturally sensitive and quick, enthusiastic learners. We can't ask for more than that. One potential downside is that highly motivated graduates may use their experience as a springboard to things outside mental health and may leave the service quickly but it's a risk we're prepared to take. Michael Benson points out that we've seen a gap and the bridge we're providing is mutually beneficial for both sides: the graduates get an opportunity to work in a profession related to their degree and we get strong candidates. He also points out that an increasing number of people are disillusioned with their jobs because they don't feel they are making a difference in the world. \"Working in mental health allows you to see the difference you make to people's lives. The profession also offers a wide variety of often interesting and well paid roles, good career progression and a job that will always be in demand given the fact that incidents of mental health problems are increasing.\" Alam Khan is a psychosis manager for Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust This article is published by Guardian Professional.
