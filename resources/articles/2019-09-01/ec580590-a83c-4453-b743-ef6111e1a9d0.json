In a statement posted online, the 32-year-old striker said she had received an initial private scan funded by the club but had since been left languishing on the NHS waiting lists with no contact from the staff of Crystal Palace Women. \u201cI wish I could say that the club has supported me but unfortunately the opposite is true. I\u2019ve received no medical support from the women\u2019s team; Crystal Palace kindly funded my initial scan. I am greatly appreciative of this as well as the support I received from the players,\u201d said Bryan, who scored over 100 goals in a first stint for Palace and rejoined the club in January after a spell at Charlton. \u201cAfter the results of my scan I was informed I would have to self-fund or wait for the NHS for my surgery [still currently waiting]. Since then I\u2019ve had zero communication from the women\u2019s team, despite me proactively emailing and messaging both the management team and club chairman. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have a meeting to say whether I wasn\u2019t getting a new contract or I was getting one. I\u2019ve been left in limbo.\u201d A statement from Crystal Palace Women said: \u201cGemma remained fully paid, beyond the terms of her agreement, until the end of the season when her registration expired. She was also offered ongoing continued access to rehabilitation support beyond the end of last season.\u201d The club have also disputed the validity of Bryan\u2019s claim that another player, believed to be Ashlee Hincks who suffered an ACL injury last week, has received preferential treatment: \u201cGemma\u2019s claim that another player with a similar injury has received different levels of treatment and support is factually incorrect.\u201d The issues raised by Bryan have stirred up longstanding frustrations over player welfare. The FA introduced new rules that require Women\u2019s Super League clubs to provide private medical insurance for players. However, similar rules will not extend down to the Championship, where the problem is felt more acutely, until the 2020-21 season. An FA spokesperson said: \u201cMedical standards are constantly improving and are under regular review to meet the future requirements of the women\u2019s game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
