Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who took the helm of Lloyds on 1 March, stunned potential bidders by setting today as a snap deadline for indicative offers \u2013 earlier than many had expected \u2013 and told interested bidders that they will be informed whether they are through to the second round within the next 10 days. As he prepared to fly to New York to meet US-based investors, Horta-Os\u00f3rio will be reassured that a handful of indicative offers had been received by the deadline, including from NBNK, the start-up bank backed by Lord Levene with former Northern Rock boss Gary Hoffman, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Money and the Co-operative Group. There had been speculation that NBNK might team up with NAB, which owns Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks, to help overcome some of the difficulties of tabling an offer for the branches, but it appeared this was not the case. The Melbourne-based NAB is regarded is one of the most credible bidders for the Lloyds branches as it has the infrastructure required to take on the extra branches and may yet be convinced to enter an indicative offer as the timetable is thought to have some flexibility built in to it. NAB is believed not to have ruled itself out and told Lloyds it would like more time to submit an indicative offer which would put a price on the branches. The European Union is demanding Lloyds sell the branches \u2013 and 4.6% of the current account market \u2013 in return for the \u00a320bn of state aid used during the banking crisis to prop up the bank, created when Lloyds rescued HBOS. Horta-Os\u00f3rio wants to sell the branches before the final report from Sir John Vickers on 12 September, which could call for more branch sales to encourage more competition The sale of the Lloyds branches coincides with the sale of the \"good\" part of Northern Rock. Initial bids for the Newcastle-based lender are due by the end of the month. NAB, NBNK and the Co-op would not comment last night, while Virgin Money insisted the situation was \"commercially sensitive\". But Virgin has made clear that it intends to submit parallel bids for the Lloyds branches and the Northern Rock business being put up for sale \u2013 although it concedes that it may only be able to proceed with one bid throughout the process. Lloyds would not reveal the identities of any bidders but stressed: \"We continue to be in active discussions with a number of interested parties.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
