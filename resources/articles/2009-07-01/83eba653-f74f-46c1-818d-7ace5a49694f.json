This detail, briskly passed over, was intriguing, suggesting as it did that the contestants are there for the duration of the series, locked in with only fiendishly cryptic, convoluted questions for company. And the questions \u2013 riddles, really \u2013 remain fearsome. Purists may claim that the challenges have got easier, but the teams are still faced with multi-part puzzles for which a working knowledge of major languages, classical music, the literary canon and the sizes of different dog breeds are basic requirements. When the Midlands team was stumped, Sutcliffe nudged them: \"There was a clue lying in the hall downstairs.\" Rosalind Miles leapt on this (\"Oh, a labrador!\") and then the stubborn conundrum gave way. \"It must be a chihuahua,\" she said. It was. The programme has a vintage feel to it, with its focus on the often obscure or highbrow, and moments of snobbish resistance to modernity (\"No one's going to sing an aria to a satnav,\"). But mostly, it's pleasantly otherworldly, and full of esoteric details. \"Two firkins make a kilderkin,\" Sutcliffe helpfully reminded us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
