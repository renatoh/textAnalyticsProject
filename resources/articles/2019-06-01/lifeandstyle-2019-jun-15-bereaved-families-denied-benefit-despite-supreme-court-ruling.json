Bereavement support payment can be claimed by people who are widowed when their husband, wife or civil partner dies, with parents eligible for a higher payment than those without children. But unmarried couples are locked out of the benefit \u2013 something that has been described by campaigners as blatant discrimination. Dean Spencer lost his partner Julie suddenly in 2015, leaving him and his son, who was three at the time. The couple had been together for five years, and he was thinking about proposing when she died. \u201cI rang the number on the government website and was told I wasn\u2019t eligible for any benefits,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said \u2018that\u2019s the law.\u2019 All because of a piece of paper.\u201d Bereavement support payment, which was introduced in April 2017 to replace three separate payments (widowed parent\u2019s allowance, bereavement payment and bereavement allowance), is paid as a lump sum of up to \u00a33,500 and then at a rate of up to \u00a3350 a month for the first 18 months after the death. Those who lost a partner before the rule change can continue to claim the older benefits until their children leave full-time education or they move in with a new partner. However, anyone who loses a partner who they were not married to is not entitled to make a claim. There are 3.3 million cohabiting couples in the UK, and of these about 1.2 million have children. Last summer, the supreme court ruled that denying Siobhan McLaughlin a widow\u2019s pension following the death of her partner breached the human rights of her and the couple\u2019s four children. Her partner John Adams, a former groundsman, died in January 2014. The decision was expected to trigger changes in the rules, but there has been no announcement, or even a consultation on extending who qualifies for the benefits. Georgia Elms, a spokeswoman for the group Widowed &amp; Young (WAY), says: \u201cI understand that we\u2019ve got Brexit paralysis, but I\u2019m really shocked that nothing has been done about it.\u201d McLaughin\u2019s case involved the widowed parent\u2019s allowance, which was worth up to \u00a3119 a week and paid until the youngest child was no longer eligible for child benefit. Before the rules were changed, campaigners had lobbied for a rethink, and for any new system to include unmarried couples. Both calls were ignored, they say. Elms says families are suffering as a result. \u201cThere are two sides to this: the financial and the personal,\u201d she says. \u201cThese people are grieving \u2013 they\u2019ve lost the parent of their child, and then they are suddenly told that in the eyes of the government, because they\u2019re not married, they don\u2019t matter.\u201d She adds: \u201cThis really affects their confidence, their grieving process, their ability to build their own life.\u201d Elms says many parents who are entitled to the benefit spend the money on childcare, allowing them to continue in work. Spencer had to leave his job of 13 years because the shifts were not compatible with nursery hours, and now his son is at school he works on the minimum wage during school hours. He would have been entitled to up to \u00a3119 a week if he had been married. \u201cThe person who is suffering is my son,\u201d he says. \u201cHolidays, days out \u2013 he doesn\u2019t get those things. We could have saved the money and used it for holidays \u2026 you get quite angry when you think about it.\u201d Vicki Wollerton from Warrington, Cheshire, lost her partner Nick in May 2017. He had been looking after their son while she worked full-time as a civil servant, and the family had been entitled to a small child tax credit payment. The couple, who had been together for 18 years, had never married. \u201cWe never even thought about getting married \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t us,\u201d she says. Wollerton had set up insurance for her income, but says she had never considered what would happen if Nick died. After his death, the child tax credit payment was stopped and she discovered she would have to apply for universal credit to replace it, and that she was not entitled to any bereavement payments. She says the payment would have made a difference \u2013 she has used up all of her savings, most of it on childcare, and because of her working hours she now has to pay for breakfast club every morning. \u201cI thought I was savvy but obviously I wasn\u2019t. I had no idea my son would be treated differently,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was quite a shock.\u201d MPs on the Commons work and pensions select committee have launched an inquiry looking into the support on offer for the bereaved, and say they will press the government on what has been done since the supreme court ruling. The committee recommended in 2016 that bereavement payments should be extended to parents who were not married because \u201cnot doing so unjustly penalises innocent children, who have no say in the matter of whether their parents were married but who are equally affected by the death of one of them\u201d. The committee\u2019s chair, Frank Field, has described the policy as archaic and said it was a \u201cprofound injustice\u201d that parents were being denied support. It meant, he said, that every day the government was telling another five bereaved parents that because they were not married, their children would be penalised. Last week the committee heard evidence from several parents: some who were eligible for bereavement support, and some who were not. The latter group included Joana Niemeyer, who was eight months pregnant when her partner David died. Their children are now three-and-a-half and seven. She said her partner had probably earned 70% of the income for the household, and they had bought a house a year earlier and had a \u201chuge\u201d mortgage. She told MPs: \u201cI think I found out just before the funeral that we were not eligible for anything \u2026 David worked for 20 years. He was always a believer in the system \u2013 the NHS, national insurance and all that. I think he would be mortified to know that we did not get anything.\u201d Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow in north-east London, says: \u201cThe courts were clear that children who had already suffered the trauma of losing a parent early in life did not deserve to pay the price for such an outdated view of family life, and the government had a responsibility to change that.\u201d It\u2019s now been some time since the introduction of bereavement support payment, she says, yet \u201cstill this government has done nothing to help address this blatant discrimination, leaving many facing poverty at the same time as the loss of a loved one\u201d. Spencer says he does not expect the government to go back and repay parents like him who have missed out. \u201cBut for other people, hopefully it could change in the future.\u201d The Department for Work and Pensions says the qualifying criteria for bereavement support were debated in parliament before the new benefit was introduced, and that it is not taxed or included when other means-tested payments are calculated. \u201cWe are committed to supporting people during bereavement and have widened the support available. This is in addition to help provided for cohabiting couples through the wider welfare system,\u201d a spokesman for the DWP added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
