The arresting, 50 metre-tall Anish Kapoor sculpture is situated a long goal-kick from Middlesbrough\u2019s home, and away fans can frequently be heard debating what the enormous web of steel wires slung between two giant hoops positioned beside the Tees actually signifies. Translated from its original Greek, Temenos means a piece of sacred land assigned as a place of sanctuary or the holy area surrounding a temple. After a year that has seen the decimation of Teesside\u2019s steel industry the installation\u2019s immediate environs have certainly proved a welcome oasis amid considerable local gloom. The Riverside will be packed to capacity on Saturday when the Championship leaders take on second-placed Derby County with the contest further spiced by a managerial sub-plot dubbed the battle of the former Real Madrid No2s. Boro\u2019s Aitor Karanka assisted Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at the Bernab\u00e9u while Derby\u2019s Paul Clement served as Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s sidekick. \u201cI think there\u2019s some big similarities between us,\u201d acknowledges Karanka. \u201cTo work with Carlo or Jos\u00e9 is like working with a master. When you\u2019re with coaches like that you\u2019re always at big clubs and always under pressure. You learn a lot. But after that, you have to put your own signature on things. When you become a manager you have to take the decisions and put into practise what you\u2019ve learned.\u201d It is evident that Boro\u2019s manager, a former Real Madrid centre-half who was capped once by Spain, absorbed quite a bit about defensive organisation from Mourinho. With Dani Ayala in imperious central defensive form, Karanka\u2019s backline is the meanest in the Championship and has now gone seven league games without conceding a goal. Indeed only two goals have been registered against Boro at the Riverside all season. Karanka is big on performing meticulous due diligence on the characters of all new recruits and this policy has helped forge an extraordinary dressing room spirit. When, back in October, the team had a mini wobble, Grant Leadbitter, Boro\u2019s captain, reacted to a defeat at Cardiff by holding a spontaneous squad gathering at his house. The players talked for hours and, with Stewart Downing shifted into his preferred central attacking position in Karanka\u2019s favoured 4-2-3-1 formation, Boro have won nine of their subsequent 11 Championship matches. An already rare bond between club and community was intensified when the left-back George Friend came up with the idea of players posing topless for a 2016 calendar with all proceeds going to the families of former steelworkers. It has not only been a big hit but reminded everyone of the importance of boosting the local economy and putting the area right back on the map by winning promotion. The latest delays to a decision over a third runway for Heathrow have meant the longed for, economically vital resumption of flights from Durham Tees Valley airport to London remains on hold but a return to the Premier League would, at least, make Middlesbrough part of the national, and international, conversation again. Karanka\u2019s problem is that his is not the only club desperate to plug into a network powered by the gargantuan riches provided by next season\u2019s top-tier television deal. If he and Clement will be deemed failures should their teams miss out on promotion, Chris Hughton is on a mission to make Brighton part of the south coast\u2019s elite, while Steve Bruce\u2019s Hull and Sean Dyche\u2019s Burnley are similarly anxious to scramble back into the Premier League. Everyone is striving to create a Temenos, their very own place of sanctuary, in the game\u2019s promised land. Ipswich, too, are in contention but their manager believes Karanka and Clement will celebrate automatic promotion in May. \u201cIf anyone finishes above Middlesbrough or Derby I\u2019ll be very surprised,\u201d says Mick McCarthy. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic for us to catch either of those two \u2013 although we\u2019ll be trying like hell.\u201d Karanka, whose side are a point ahead of Derby with a game in hand, seems in cautious agreement. \u201cI think the league will be clearer this season than it was last year,\u201d he says. \u201cEven so, a lot of things can still happen and we have to concentrate on maintaining our momentum. I\u2019ve only been in England two years but I know that every single game in this division is tough. I know we could beat Derby but then easily go somewhere like Bolton and lose.\u201d The plight of Neil Lennon\u2019s bottom-placed Bolton \u2013 a recent, established top-flight team who are now struggling to meet their wage bill \u2013 serves as a salutary warning of what can go wrong when clubs spend beyond their means in high-stakes promotion gambles. Karanka is suitably desperate to insulate Boro\u2019s financial future with television riches. \u201cThe only thing I care about is Middlesbrough being in the Premier League next season,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be difficult for me to find a better chairman than Steve Gibson and I feel attached to this club, to this crowd and to the people who live here. My family are enjoying it a lot, we\u2019re really comfortable here. I feel I\u2019m in the right place, with the right people, at the right moment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
