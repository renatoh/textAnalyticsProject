The line-up: Maja Ivarsson (vocals), Felix Rodriguez (guitars), Johan Bengtsson (bass), Jesper Anderberg (synthesizers), Fredrik Nilsson (drums). The background: It's our old friend, four nondescript geezers and a spunky blond frontwoman. Ring any bells? Hello? Transvision Vamp? Darling Buds? The Primitives? Blondie? This example of the paradigm are Swedish synth-rockers rehabilitating '80s New Wave, US style. So you get by-numbers 'rock' with heaps of 'attitude' and 'edge' and 'spiky guitars' and 'hook-laden perky pop-punk tunes with choruses that won't quit' or something. You can imagine this stuff on the soundtrack to The Breakfast Club or St Elmo's Fire as Molly Ringwald does a kooky Cyndi Lauper dance. Mystifyingly, they're venerated in alt.rock circles. Blender voted Maja Top Music Heroine and their second album Dying To Say This To You won an MTV award nomination. They've had support slots with Panic! At The Disco, The Strokes and Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl wore a Sounds T-shirt in the video to Times Like These, and they've had four million plays on their MySpace page in seven months. The album - 11 x three-minute bursts of pseudo-angst and fake energy - was recorded at Studio 880 in Oakland, California, where Green Day did American Idiot. It was produced by Jeff Saltzman of The Killers' Hot Fuss fame with additional production from James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins) and Adam Schlesinger (Fountains Of Wayne), with mixing by Paul Q Kolderie (Radiohead, Pixies). But no amount of muscle and cred can elevate this music beyond the realms of the ersatz and mundane. What else? The LP sleeve features some seriously foxy ladies, with cleavage akimbo. The single Tony The Beat was voted one of the tracks of 2006 by Rolling Stone and features in Hugh Grant/Drew Barrymore Valentine's Day chick-flick Music &amp; Lyrics. And their music even appeared on the Snakes On A Plane soundtrack. But we're still not 'aving it. The buzz: \"Brilliantly blends the synth-infused pop of the '80s with modern rock.\" The truth: Averagely blends the synth-infused pop of the '80s with modern rock. Most likely to: Start a ra-ra skirts and legwarmers revival. Least likely to: Wear ra-ra skirts and legwarmers themselves - especially the fellas in the band. File next to: The Go-Go's, Kim Wilde, Blondie, Pat Benatar. What to buy: Tony The Beat is out now on Korova. Dying To Say This To You is released on March 19.
