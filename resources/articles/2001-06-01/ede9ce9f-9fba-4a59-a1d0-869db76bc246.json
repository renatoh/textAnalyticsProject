A lot of it has to do with the fact that Graham Henry is notorious for losing track of the clock in training. And, if he's bad, then Andy Robinson is worse. And Phil Larder worse again. It's quaint, in one way, irritating in another; but basically the Lions are always late. Last Wednesday, more in hope than expectation, I phoned up Djuro Sen, the communications manager with the Wallabies, who were staying north of Sydney in Coffs Harbour. This is the very resort to which the Lions will travel for their next midweek game against the New South Wales Cockatoos. I wonder if they'll bump into each other. I explained to Djuro who I was and asked if it would be at all possible to speak to George Gregan. 'And if I can't get George, have you a back-up?' Djuro wanted to know. Stephen Larkham? 'And a third choice?' Er, David Giffin? 'Aw, mate, David might be a problem, but, look, give me an hour and I'll get back to you.' Exactly 60 minutes later, Djuro was on the phone: 'Right, I've got George right here with me. Off you go.' Just like that, there he was, the world's most influential scrum-half, the half-back whom the Lions must tame if they are to have a chance in the series, one half of the Gregan-Larkham partnership that frightens the pants off many an opposing side with their vision, their cheek, their competitiveness and their skills. Of course, when I say 'There he was', I don't really know if it was George there at all. Perhaps the Wallabies are so advanced that they have stand-ins for telephone interviews. But it sounded like little George. 'We had a good hit-out against the New Zealand Maoris. It was just what we needed, a game of Test-match intensity. Some things were good, but in general we reckon we can be a lot better.' If Larkham is quiet, Gregan is yappy on the field. Larkham is languid and injury-prone. Gregan is all bustle, and although he, like his partner, missed the game against England at Twickenham last November, he seems to have bounced back better than ever. He gets stuck in, a muscled little imp among giants, and always seems to come out unscathed. He was the first player to try - and perfect - the flip behind-the-back inside pass from the scrum-half running flat across the field to somebody large cutting through at speed. Now that everybody else uses it, George has cut down on it. But he's still a bag of tricks. And he can tackle. The one he made on Jeff Wilson in the Tri Nations game against the All Blacks, what, seven years ago, has gone down in the annals alongside such try- savers as the one JPR Williams once made on J-P Gordon of France. Wilson the Kiwi winger was not only clear but in the act of diving over for the try that would have won the Test, when he was suddenly exoceted by a horizontal Gregan. The ball flew loose and Australia won. It is now George who is the marked man, the one the Lions must stop. 'I guess it's pretty flattering to be selected like that as the danger man. Stephen and I are aware that we are pulled out for special attention, but there's good protection around us. 'The unsung heroes are the guys who make sure we can operate no matter what our opponents are trying to do.' George's confidence is high. His sub-Test team, the ACT Brumbies, recently became the first non-New Zealand side to win the Super 12. Australian Capital Territory may have once enjoyed the services of David Campese, but it was not a real rugby stronghold until the Brumbies Super 12 franchise came their way. Many players were drafted in from the rugby-playing states of New South Wales and Queensland to create the Brumbies squad. But not George, who is Canberra-born and bred. He went to St Edmund College in the city, a school with a proud rugby tradition. 'Ricky Stuart, who now plays league, went there. And if at senior grade ACT wasn't very strong in those days, it's all-change now. To win the Super 12 was just immense. It's bred confidence, and not just here, but for all the states in Australia.' In the past couple of weeks, a war of words has started in the press. Australians reckon the Lions are dirty and cheats; the Poms think the Wallabies are, um, dirty and cheats. It's all good, dirty, cheating fun. 'Look, we've got a lot of healthy respect for the Lions,' said George. 'We think they're going to play in a positive style. But, look, it's going to be intense and physical and the banter is all part of the build-up to that. But don't read too much into it. We play against New Zealanders and South Africans, so we're kind of used to all that.' So, thanks George. Good luck, play well, but you know, I can't wish_ 'No worries. I know what you mean.' And with that he was gone, off to be punctual for his next media engagement. A force to be reckoned with. I hope it was the real George Gregan.
