Musically, it\u2019s often stunning. However, Sellars\u2019 treatment, though striking, may not be to everyone\u2019s taste. The action is largely confined to a platform in front of the orchestra, though Haraschta the poacher (Hanno M\u00fcller-Brachmann) prowls around in the stalls, his rifle slung across his shoulders. Cast and chorus are uniformly dressed in black, and there is no visible differentiation between animals and humans. However, video projections above the orchestra provide images of teeming nature and the drab world of mankind. Quivering tadpoles become frogs during the introduction, and insects copulate during the love scene between Lucy Crowe\u2019s Vixen and Sophia Burgos\u2019s Fox. Gerald Finley\u2019s Forester seemingly lives not in a lodge but in an urban apartment block, while folk dancers prance about at Haraschta\u2019s wedding. The end result, though admirably free from cuteness or sentimentality, can on occasion be charmless, and short on the playfulness that offsets the beauty and sadness of the score. Finley, in a deeply moving performance, is in many ways the protagonist here, a melancholy, alienated figure who eventually finds contentment in acceptance of the eternal renewal of nature. Crowe, in superb voice, makes a wonderful Vixen, mischievous, charismatic, naive yet tender in her duet with Burgos. In a consistently good cast, Peter Hoare\u2019s sad Schoolmaster, Jan Martin\u00edk\u2019s dour Parson and M\u00fcller-Brachmann, gritty sounding and fierce, stand out. The choral contributions \u2013 from the London Symphony Chorus and the children of the LSO Discovery Voices \u2013 are extremely fine. The work itself, meanwhile, has long been among Rattle\u2019s personal favourites. \u201cIt\u2019s the piece that made me want to become an opera conductor,\u201d he writes in the programme, and he conducts it with great affection, keenly alert both to its drama and the astonishing beauty of its evocation of the natural world. The playing is outstanding. \u2022 Repeated at the Barbican, London, on 29 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
