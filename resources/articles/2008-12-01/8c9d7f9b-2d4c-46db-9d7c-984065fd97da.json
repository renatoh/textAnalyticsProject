BBC bosses came under fire for spending so much money on entertaining 300-plus people at London's Oxo Tower to promote Merlin at a time of staff cutbacks. It was the biggest of four such events in 2008 at a total cost of nearly \u00a3164,000, Channel 4 News established using freedom of information laws. However, the BBC chief operating officer, Caroline Thomson, defended the bill. \"We don't party for party's sake; we choose the programmes we are going to launch at parties very carefully. We only did three BBC1 dramas last year,\" she told Channel 4 News. \"When we do it, we do it because we are very proud of the programmes and we therefore do the launch in the most cost-effective way possible. \"Yes it is a lot of money, and we have to be very careful how we spend that money, but sometimes it does cost a lot of money to do these things properly.\" The cost included food, drink, room hire, photography, security, entertainment, invitations, transport and production. A total of 326 people, including the media, cast, crew, directors, actors, presenters, community representatives and \"opinion formers\", were invited. Other programmes launched with parties were The Passion, The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency and Little Dorrit. The general secretary of broadcasting and media union Bectu, Gerry Morrissey, said he was shocked by the spending as the BBC had plenty of its own facilities to host such an event. \"I am shocked, because at a time when the BBC has made 2,000 staff redundant this year ... it will seem extremely strange to people inside the BBC that this level of money is being spent externally on a launch party,\" he told Channel 4 News. \"I am not saying that they shouldn't do it, but I believe they have plenty of in-house facilities that would be suitable.\" The Liberal Democrat culture spokesman, Don Foster, said: \"Those people who pay their licence fee want that money to be spent on top quality broadcasting, not on top quality parties.\" Releasing the figures, the BBC said such events were \"standard across the television industry\" but that the BBC had cut back on the number and would reduce it still further. \"No organisation is immune from the current financial crisis and every part of our spend is being scrutinised to look at where we can reduce costs,\" it added. \"As well as programme launches, we have put in place a wide ranging programme to reduce use of taxis, spend on entertaining, attendance at award ceremonies and conferences as well as hospitality.\" \"In 2008/09, we intend to reduce both the number and spend on the programme launches we hold still further due to the financial pressures we're facing.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
