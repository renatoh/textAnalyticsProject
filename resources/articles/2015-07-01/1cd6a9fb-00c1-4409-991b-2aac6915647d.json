North Queensland-based MP Warren Entsch, who is championing cross-party efforts to legalise same-sex marriage in Australia, said he planned to use Lachlan Beaton\u2019s video message about his personal struggle to persuade other politicians to back the reform. \u201cThe cemeteries are full \u2013 are full \u2013 of people that have never been able to come to terms with their sexuality and that\u2019s a fact,\u201d Entsch told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhy should we as a society do things that will contribute to filling those bloody vacant spaces in cemeteries because we\u2019re not prepared to accept the worth of an individual for who they really are?\u201d Entsch made the comments as he praised Beaton \u2013 who grew up in regional Victoria but now lives in New York \u2013 for sharing a personal story about the experience of hiding his sexuality for years. In a video message posted on YouTube and seen by thousands of people, Beaton said he knew he was gay when he was about 14 or 15 years old but was from an area \u201cwhere it felt wrong to be gay\u201d and kept it hidden for another 12 years. \u201cNo one should ever feel like this,\u201d Beaton said. \u201cFor years I hated myself, I hated who I was; I would cry on a weekly basis wishing that I wasn\u2019t the person that I was born into this world.\u201d The tears \u201cturned into months of depression\u201d, he said. Beaton admitted to \u201cself-destructive\u201d behaviour as he struggled with feelings of low self-worth and tried to numb the pain by drinking too much. He spoke of how he \u201cwould go to great lengths to hide it\u201d \u2013 which was incredibly tiring \u2013 and that there were times when he had suicidal thoughts and \u201cjust didn\u2019t want to exist\u201d. \u201cSo until the age of 27 when I came out I can honestly say that I actually hated the person that I was \u2013 and that is one very, very tough thing to live with,\u201d Beaton said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop this. It\u2019s time to stop young people making them feel like it\u2019s wrong to be gay, and whilst [same-sex] marriage is not allowed in Australia ... people will feel like this. People will hide. People will hate themselves and, trust me, you live with that hate for a long, long, long time. \u201cI\u2019m one of the lucky ones who was very well-accepted when I came out. When I was 27 I met someone that I really, really loved and I decided to come out. My friends and my family accepted me for who I was, and I\u2019m so, so lucky for that.\u201d Beaton\u2019s twin brother, Charles Beaton, said it was an \u201cabsolute surprise\u201d when Lachlan told him at the end of 2007 that he was gay. \u201cI had no idea at all, and we are very close,\u201d Charles said. \u201cThe fact that I didn\u2019t know and we lived together for the last 18 months of that period in a very small apartment is testament to the fact of how big the secret was, because throughout this time he was seeing people and going out and meeting people. It was a massive secret.\u201d Charles said Lachlan had decided that now was the right time to tell his story to the public, partly to persuade Australian MPs to back marriage equality. \u201cIt\u2019s close. It clearly is a matter of one or two MPs changing their minds and this gets over the line,\u201d Charles said. \u201cHe has probably never been ready until now to actually talk so openly because some of the video was news to everyone. I, as his twin brother, knew a lot of it but not all of it, not how bad it actually got from a mental health perspective.\u201d Charles sent the video to numerous MPs, including Entsch, who plans to introduce a marriage equality bill backed by Liberal, Labor, Greens and independent MPs when parliament resumes in August. Charles said receiving a personal phone call from Entsch as a result of the email was \u201cprobably one of the more emotional 15 minutes of my life to be honest\u201d. \u201cHe reiterated numerous times for me to tell Lachlan how proud he was that he was doing this,\u201d Charles said. \u201cIt was a pretty blunt conversation \u2026 He gets the association between identity and mental health, suicide, all the issues that flow from it.\u201d Gay, lesbian and bisexual people attempt suicide at rates between 3.5 and 14 times those of their heterosexual peers, according to a position statement by Suicide Prevention Australia. A report by the National LGBTI Health Alliance said at least 36.2% of transgender and 24.4% of gay, lesbian and bisexual Australians met the criteria for experiencing a major depressive episode in 2005, compared with 6.8% of the general population. The same report said there was a lack of data about intersex people but overseas research and anecdotal evidence in Australia pointed to \u201crates of suicidal tendencies and self-harming behaviour well above those of the general population\u201d. Entsch decided to make the phone call after receiving emails from Charles and the parents telling Lachlan\u2019s story. In an interview, the MP for the Queensland seat of Leichhardt said: \u201cI first of all asked him to pass on my thanks to his parents for raising him, and I think it\u2019s important to do that, and secondly to pass on to his brother my great pride that I have for him, for his strength, of being true to who he really is, [and] the family who are prepared to stand beside him and being proud of him for the incredibly strong, courageous and special human being that he is.\u201d Entsch said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d intended to use the video to help make the case to MPs who remained undecided about the importance of marriage equality. But he declined to comment on the prospects of achieving a free vote so that Coalition MPs can vote according to their conscience. Conservative forces within the Liberal party are opposing the push to change the section of the Marriage Act that defines it as a union between a man and a woman. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, has played down the prospect of the private member\u2019s bill even proceeding to a vote in parliament, but Liberal moderates argue the party should respectfully consider the proposal. Entsch said he would \u201chave a lot more to say\u201d after the bill was presented to parliament. He wanted show dignity and respect for the process. \u201cPeople like Lachlan and his parents and his brother are entitled to that,\u201d Entsch said. Charles said Lachlan planned to get married next year, probably overseas, \u201chopefully in Australia, but who knows\u201d.
