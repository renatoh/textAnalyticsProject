This follows a deluge of complaints. The company also said it would join the new ombudsman for the mobile phone industry. From next summer, the ombudsman will have the power to fine firms and force them to pay compensation. Many mobile phone operators have so far refused to support the ombudsman scheme openly. John Caudwell, the multi-millionaire owner of the company, said he recognised that the number of complaints against the firm and the anger and frustration experienced by many customers showed the company had failed in many areas. But he rejected the views of customers and several staff who have written to Jobs &amp; Money, that the lapses are part of an aggressive business culture and are endemic across the organisation. Mr Caudwell is the chairman of Caudwell Group - one of Britain's largest private companies - in which he has a 97% stake. The group includes Phones4U and Singlepoint, a reseller of Vodafone airtime. Many profiles of the 48-year-old former factory worker have appeared in magazines and newspapers documenting the rise of his company from a second-hand car dealership to a mobile phone company with 1.2m customers, a turnover of more than \u00a31bn and profits in excess of \u00a320m. Considered to be Britain's 23rd richest person, he is often characterised as a bluff entrepreneur who enjoys the trappings of wealth, including a 60-foot schooner. Unions accuse him of making his money at the expense of giving his workers a decent wage and running a call centre that is more akin to a sweat shop. Mr Caudwell accepts that conditions are cramped at the Singlepoint call centre in Stoke-on-Trent and that wages are low, but says his workers are paid more than the average for the area. \"The annual salary for call centre staff in Stoke is \u00a38,250 whereas our starting pay is \u00a310,500. And people who show initiative and are here for more than a year can see that amount go up quite a lot. But I have to admit that our wages are low,\" he says. Nevertheless, he says the angry criticisms of complaint handling by call centre staff has shown him that he will need to pay his staff more if he is to raise morale and improve relations with customers. Pay rises will not be universal, however, and his tactics may fail to boost morale. \"I am going to review the pay scales. We want to reward the right people and get rid of the bad pennies,\" he says. Mr Caudwell's pledges will come too late for many Jobs &amp; Money readers who would prefer never to deal with Singlepoint again. They say they have been traumatised by their treatment by the company and would rather avoid any further contact. Ashley Lewis of Maidenhead in Berkshire says he wrote to Mr Caudwell but never received a reply. He is being pursued by Singlepoint for \u00a3145 it alleges he owes, mainly for costs arising from the dispute. The original argument was over a \u00a330 reconnection fee. In June Mr Lewis says he was outraged when a letter signed \"Customer Care Department\" arrived that included a paragraph he believes took the company's threats to new heights. The letter says: \"If you do not make payment immediately we will pass your account to an external debt collection agency. They will pursue you for payment on our behalf. This may include visits to your home.\" John Caudwell says he is outraged that such a letter was sent to a customer: \"I believe it is a disgraceful letter and must be the result of an employee who is very disenchanted and definitely acting outside our normal practices.\" Mr Kerr of Sheffield says he also received threats of home visits, but ignored them and he hasn't heard anything from the company for eight months. \"It is a nasty experience receiving a letter like this. But they are empty gestures,\" he says. Many more readers said they had been threatened by letter or by call centre staff to pay an outstanding balance. They were told they would receive a bad credit record and their case would be passed to the debt collection agency used by the company. Nigel Meeson of Petworth in Sussex fell foul of the company when he tried to give one month's notice at the end of a 12-month contract. It continued to charge him and when he contacted Singlepoint to say a cancellation letter had been sent, it replied that no record of the letter existed. Mr Meeson pointed out in a succession of letters that he had followed the contract. In a letter signed \"Customer Care\", he was told: \"If your account remains in default we are obliged to share this information with credit reference agencies. This may affect your ability to gain credit in the future.\" While Mr Caudwell approves of threatening customers with a bad credit record, he concedes: \"I think we should soften our line.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
