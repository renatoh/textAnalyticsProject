The subterranean world seems to act as a repository for everything lost, forgotten or unimaginable - the physical antithesis to the orderly lives we lead above the ground. Whatever primeval pull the underground exerts upon us, Stephen Smith is far from immune to it. We first come across him deep in some tunnel beneath north London's pavements and several miles from the nearest exit, when the lights go out. This provides him with the perfect opportunity, he coolly informs us, to get to grips with his lurking claustrophobia. Yikes! Either Smith is a glutton for punishment or he has prescribed himself the most brutal course of aversion therapy. His point of departure is the London Connection, a 20km tunnel being dug by the National Grid to accommodate a new power supply. When Smith finally emerges, blinking, into the daylight, he is undaunted. On the contrary, in next to no time he's off again, like a ferret down the trouser leg of London, inveigling his way into every crypt-clearance, archaeological dig and sewer tour he can find. The city's sewers certainly loom large in his itinerary. Effluent fairly courses through the pages of Underground London. On the whole, the author seems quite happy to pull on his waders and make his way through it, carefully sliding each foot forward with the same \"stiff-legged gait of deep-sea divers\" to avoid slipping and taking a dip. Smith picks over the finger buffet at \"Wick Lane Sewer Week\" before being winched down into the drains to join London's flushers - the invisible men who patrol the culverts, apparently pausing only to flatten passing rats with a doff of their hard hats. From Bazalgette's municipal sewers, Smith progresses to the more sophisticated, if equally geriatric, flushing arrangements in the bowels of the Houses of Parliament - an establishment, one might imagine, given to producing more than its fair share of effluent. Gurmet Kalsi and his colleagues are the men down in the Torpedo Room, keeping an eye on the dials of the storm chargers and sewage ejectors. With its half-timbered vats and cast-iron pipes, the whole system might have been constructed by Wallace and Gromit, and the reader can't help but secretly hope for some momentary lapse of judgment on Gurmet's part, inducing some dreadful meltdown, so that one or two of the parliamentarians above him might suffer the same fate as Richard the Raker, who is said to have fallen into a London cesspit in 1326 and drowned \"monstrously in his own excrement\". But if we fail to see the fireworks at the Houses of Parliament, they make plenty of appearances elsewhere in the book. We hear how the trapped gases in a festering River Fleet went up in 1846, taking part of Clerkenwell with them and unleashing a tidal wave of sewage into King's Cross. We hear of spontaneously combusting coffins in Kensal Green (where, if Thomas Willson had had his way in the 1830s, we would now be able to look upon and perhaps one day take up permanent residence in the vast Pyramid Cemetery, along with five million other souls). There are even exploding rats, or at least the threat of them, when the author is on safari down the drains beneath SW1 and is advised against treading on a rat's bloated carcass or risk it going off \"like a chicken Kiev\". Nobody could accuse Smith of lacking commitment. When he's not up to his knees in sewage he's up to his shins in plague pits or accompanying London Underground's track gangs as they make their midnight rounds. While he's down there he records every reported sighting of the resident ghosts without flinching: the Egyptian mummy which is said to stumble along the disused line beneath the British Museum, the restless spirits of frustrated thesps, not to mention the legendary ghost stations themselves - those ox-bow lakes of the London Underground, where time ground to a halt in whichever year they were decommissioned and which are now consigned to the darkness, with their peeling posters and cobwebbed vending machines. The stories that truly haunt the reader, however, are those buried away in the safe-deposit boxes under Fleet Street, where the mementos of babies who were given away at birth reside next to the plait of hair that belonged to the daughter murdered at the concentration camp. Smith has picked out for himself a most uncomfortable journey, and along the way he duly nods in acknowledgment to all the city's chroniclers who've gone before. That's an awful lot of nodding - from the Iain Sinclairs and Peter Ackroyds and Roy Porters of our own times right back to Tacitus - and it highlights one of the problems in the whole undertaking: the sense that, both below ground as well as above it, London has been so comprehensively documented that the author's feet are occasionally in danger of falling where others have already trodden. What sets the book apart, though, is its wonderful cast of characters: the underworld's labourers, tour guides and turnkeys Smith encounters on his way. He can conjure them up in a moment (\"With his chewing gum, his aftershave, and his M&amp;S suit, Steve was waiting for me at Woolwich Reach\") and is adept with dialogue (\"'How deep are we right now?' I asked Steve. 'Deep enough,' he said\"). More importantly, Smith clearly enjoys the company of his subjects, whether it's the young Goths and nostalgic pensioners who mingle at the \"Graves of Variety Artistes\" slide show or the bishop on board the pleasure boat who wonders aloud when the bar might open. The only people who are in danger of defeating Smith are the members of Subterranea Britannica - motto: \"If it's manmade and underground, we're interested\" - who come across as a singularly melancholy crew. Fiercely territorial of their conquests, they are forever ushering their fellow SubBrits out of the frame when photographing whatever concrete bunker they've managed to gain access to. They all fall into line, however, when Duncan Campbell moves among them. The investigative journalist is the undisputed champion when it comes to penetrating and cataloguing secret Britain. In 1980 he reportedly lifted a manhole cover in Bethnal Green and found his way into a labyrinth of government tunnels. Having had the foresight to take a folding bicycle along with him, Campbell proceeded to explore the tunnels unchallenged, the recollection of which has his audience of SubBrits eating out of his hand. It's a curious image, a man on his bicycle touring London's most secret corridors, and it's one that lingers, along with an earlier description of a London Underground engineer making his way down a ghostly Northern Line with a mighty spanner over one shoulder. There's something weirdly appealing about these individuals quietly following their subterranean circuits - London's own Harry Limes - and my only regret with regard to Underground London is that its various forays might have accumulated more power and momentum if they had been part of a larger circuit of their own. That said, there is plenty to recommend Smith's adventures in London's plumbing. His prose is tight and bright and full of wit. And in the end this book is worth tracking down, not least as a celebration of all the underworld's hidden inhabitants and secret custodians who go about their murky business far below us, leaving us to go about ours by the light of day.
