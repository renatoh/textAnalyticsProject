If so, they will not only replicate their rare feat of Wimbledon in 2012, when they were joint champions over 30 years of age, they will challenge many assumptions about the physicality of the modern game. Only twice before in the Open era have there been men\u2019s and women\u2019s champions at a major both in their 30s, each time at Wimbledon: in 1969 when Rod Laver did the grand slam for the second time (seven years after sweeping the majors as a freckled-faced pup), joining Ann Jones on the dance floor at the champions\u2019 ball; then in 1975, the year Arthur Ashe and Billie Jean King held the trophies aloft. There have been 11 men and eight women over 30 who have won at least one major \u2013 and there have been many barren years \u2013 26 out of 35 \u2013 when the titles went to players under that age: 1976, 78-81, 84-85, 88-89, 91-97, 99-2000, 04-11. The list reveals the ebb and flow of the game fairly well. In the modern era, the span between 2004 and 2011 coincides with the dominance of twentysomething rivals Federer and Rafael Nadal in the men\u2019s game, and Serena in the women\u2019s. The most productive period for mature players was between 1969 and 1977, the year Virginia Wade broke a long drought for Great Britain. There was pause for thought here this week about whether we really are returning to the age of the seasoned winner, just as a couple of outrageously talented teenagers, Catherine Bellis and Borna Coric, began to stir things up. However, the evidence, historical and recent, as well as logic suggest they will have to wait a little longer to make their mark \u2013 especially if Federer and Williams continue to confound all predictions. Nate Silver\u2019s informative website, FiveThirtyEight (the number of electoral colleges in a presidential election), calculates that players over 29 have won only 10.3 per cent of all majors. And history supports the pessimism of the site\u2019s John Ryle: \u201cMany legends were done winning grand slam events by their mid-20s. Boris Becker\u2019s last of six was at age 28. Mats Wilander won his seventh and final major at 24. John McEnroe (7) and Bjorn Borg (11) were done at 25. Even Jimmy Connors (8), famed for his longevity \u2013 he made his famous run to the semis at the US Open in 1991 at age 39 \u2013 won his final major, the 1983 US Open, at 31.\u201d I would contend, though, that Federer and Williams have timing \u2013 if not time \u2013 on their side this fortnight. For the first time in many years, there is genuine doubt about the winner, especially in the men\u2019s tournament. Crucially, for Federer, who is playing as well as he has done in years, Nadal is missing. Had he been here and fit, I would have made the Spaniard a slight favourite to retain his title, because I\u2019m not altogether convinced that Novak Djokovic is at full throttle. While Williams has often referred to the fact she and Federer stand alongside each other with 17 majors, Roger gave a puzzling reply in Cincinnati two weeks ago when asked had he thought about their simultaneously moving on to 18 slam titles at Flushing Meadows. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that, no,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, no, totally separate to me. I don\u2019t know if it is to you, but to me it is. But it\u2019s great what she\u2019s doing, no doubt. It\u2019s great that she\u2019s still playing and winning.\u201d Kidding or seriously tunnel-visioned, Federer could well be congratulating Williams on another triumph for the game\u2019s old guys on Monday week.
