Sadly, that wasn't very long at all, as the artist died from an Aids-related illness in 1990 at the age of 31. But he left his mark - literally, in the case of thousands of graffiti works - with a lexicon of bold cartoon doodles that developed into a worldwide franchise. Given that Haring is best known for kaleidoscopic murals, Baltic's display of his early work initially seems underwhelming: a few cases of scribbles put together in 1981 for a New York magazine. Yet for those interested in Haring's personal mythology, they are the equivalent of the Dead Sea Scrolls, as it was from these drawings that his entire artistic vocabulary was formed. Haring's repertoire of sci-fi hieroglyphics has the distinction of being accessible yet opaque at the same time. The most recurrent figures are the funny dog-shaped creature and crawling babies he used as a graffiti tag, plus scores of abbreviated humanoid forms, such as a race of gingerbread men running round and getting up to mischief - most of it faintly obscene. Haring claimed that these pictograms carried no particular significance, which wasn't quite true: the bizarre narratives involving flying saucers and friendly dolphins are the Manhattan-gay-scene equivalent of cave paintings, suggesting that if Neanderthal man's mission was to spear bison, his modern-day counterpart's was to go out and enjoy as much fellatio as possible. But there is a naivety and vivacity to these illustrations that, in light of subsequent developments, make them seem almost tragic. \u00b7 Until January 7.
