I honestly have no idea", "bodyText": "I\u2019m trying to get my dad to use his iPhone. Being hard of hearing \u2013 and I\u2019m going the same way on that front \u2013 it would be so much easier to communicate if he could text better. A problem he and my mum have is that their screens don\u2019t seem to respond to their fingers properly. I\u2019ve blamed the way they stab so desperately at their phones, but I read somewhere that it\u2019s because older people have drier skin on their hands, which makes them less touchscreen-capable. Either way, my dad\u2019s particular issue is kind of conceptual. Time and again, he asks me the same question: \u201cWhat is an app?\u201d I tell him: \u201cWell, it\u2019s just an, erm, app.\u201d This isn\u2019t much help, but I eventually find some form of words that has him nodding and we move on. Then, a month or so later, the same question again, delivered with ever more brow-furrowing angst: \u201cAde, please can you explain, what is an app?\u201d Whatever I say doesn\u2019t seem to help the poor chap. Google certainly doesn\u2019t help with this, serving up a definition that, for my dad, prompts as many questions as it answers: \u201cSimply put, an app is a type of software that allows you to perform specific tasks. Applications for desktop or laptop computers are sometimes called desktop applications, while those for mobile devices are called mobile apps. When you open an application, it runs inside the operating system until you close it.\u201d I haven\u2019t even shared this \u201cexplanation\u201d with him yet. There\u2019s no point. I\u2019ve tried everything. I have sought to work up a decent analogy, but without success. Getting him to think of his record player as a kind of app to play his records didn\u2019t work. And neither did one about his car and its engine, which ended up confusing me more than him. Suggestions welcome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
