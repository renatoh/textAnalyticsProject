The Brave Blossoms overcame a nervous opening to keep alive their hopes of reaching the knockout stages for the first time, to the relief of hundreds of fans watching the match on giant screens at a fanzone in central Tokyo. \u201cThe pressure of the occasion definitely got to them, but they did well in the end. I still think we can get to the last eight,\u201d said Keizo Sakurai, a company employee who danced a jig, beer in hand, when Japan all but sealed victory in the second half. His colleague, Ryota Ohada, was more circumspect. \u201cThe quarterfinals are our goal, even if that may be a case of heart ruling head,\u201d said Ohada, the owner of an impressive cauliflower ear. If the fanzone was any indication, Japan have quickly become every neutral\u2019s favourite team, even among supporters of their Pool A rivals. Locals decked out in the red-and-white-hooped shirts of Japan mingled with supporters from Ireland and Scotland, along with a smattering of fans from Wales, France and England. \u201cRugby is still a minor sport in Japan compared to baseball and football, but at the office today all people were talking about was the rugby. As a rugby fanatic, that almost brought me to tears,\u201d Ohada added. Mayumi Kishi, who was watching the match with her husband, Aki, was realistic about her compatriots\u2019 chances against tougher opposition in their next three pool games. \u201cWe made so many mistakes at the start,\u201d she said. \u201cI really want Japan to go far in the tournament, but if we are as careless as that in our upcoming matches we are going to be punished. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Kishi added, as a group of Welsh fans broke into song and a white-shirted salarymen was held aloft by his colleagues. \u201cWith football you can really sense the rivalry between fans from different countries, but there isn\u2019t any of that here.\u201d Earlier in the evening, the drizzle and humidity that marred the build-up to the tournament had mercifully been replaced by clear skies when the pre-match entertainment began with a fly-past by Blue Impulse, the aerobatics squadron of the Japanese air self-defence force. The 49,000 spectators packed into Tokyo Stadium were then guided through a hi-tech celebration of Japan\u2019s spiritual and agrarian roots. Re-creating a traditional Japanese festival, with appropriately heavy Shinto overtones, a lone man in the centre of the pitch bowed and donned a mask that transformed him into a deity. A floating origami rugby ball turned into individual lights \u2013 creating 15 \u201cgods\u201d, each representing a rugby position and, according to the official programme, 15 natural phenomena. The ultra-modern graphics aside, the event was a respectful nod to Japan\u2019s mythological origins, all but ignoring its status as a modern economic superpower. There was no room here for the shinkansen bullet train, electronics or robotics. The only vehicles to appear pitchside in the land of Toyota and Nissan belonged to Land Rover \u2013 a tournament sponsor. Instead, there were sun-kissed rice paddies, the thunder of dozens of taiko drummers accompanied by 200 dancers, and images if 12 venues beamed onto banners found at Shinto shrines. A father-and-son kabuki theatre act prefaced the arrival of a 3-D representation of Mount Fuji. With Japan\u2019s highest mountain as the centrepiece, hundreds of children in the colours of the participating teams danced and sang the Rugby World Cup anthem, The World in Union. The chairman of World Rugby, Bill Beaumont, congratulated the Japanese organisers, declaring they had \u201cmade history\u201d with the start of the first Rugby World Cup in Asia. He also had a message for the teams: \u201cThis is your moment to shine on our greatest stage. I know that you will inspire a new generation of fans by competing at your very best, promoting rugby\u2019s values of integrity, solidarity, respect, discipline and passion.\u201d The ceremony climaxed with an unlikely union between two icons \u2013 one of an entire nation, the other of rugby. After bearing images celebrating the tournament\u2019s history, Fuji cast off its slopes to reveal Richie McCaw, the former All Blacks captain, holding the Webb Ellis Cup his side retained at the last tournament in 2015. The trophy is almost certainly destined not to end up in Japanese hands at the World Cup\u2019s climax on 2 November, but on a memorable opening night for their fans, the Brave Blossoms finally reached full bloom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
