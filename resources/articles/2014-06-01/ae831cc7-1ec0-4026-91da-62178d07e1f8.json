At a specially convened meeting the party voted by 45 to 32 to reject the call. The outcome was welcomed by the local Liberal Democrat MP Julian Huppert as the right decision. There were some in the party leadership that feared a vote for a contest by Cambridge might have led to other constituency parties reopening the issue of Clegg's leadership. The party leader will next week hold a press conference to set out the party's broad election manifesto themes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
