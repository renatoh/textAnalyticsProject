Cahill, who is the Socceroos\u2019 all-time top scorer, announced his retirement from international football following last year\u2019s World Cup, before making one final appearance off the bench in a friendly against Lebanon in his home town of Sydney in November. He continued playing at club level, for Jamshedpur in the Indian Super League, but has now called time on his playing career at all levels and will instead focus on getting his coaching badges and other interests. \u201cNo, I\u2019m an old man now in football years,\u201d Cahill told Optus Sport when asked if he would play on. \u201cI\u2019d love to keep playing, you know 39, had a great stint for six months in India. \u201cBut I\u2019m interested in TV, going to start my A licence and spend quality time with my family and chill out for a bit.\u201d At club level, Cahill played for Millwall, Everton, New York Red Bulls, Shanghai Shenhua, Zhejiang Greentown and Melbourne City before playing one season in India. In his eight years at Everton he scored 56 goals across 226 appearances, and was named the club\u2019s player of the season for 2004\u201305. \u201cIt was amazing to play in four big continents. I had a great career and I\u2019m really thankful,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cI\u2019m someone that massively respects the game and I\u2019ll take my time to learn more. Coaching is something that\u2019s definitely going to be on the horizon.\u201d Cahill, who is widely considered one of the greatest Socceroos of all time, made 107 international appearances and scored 50 goals across a record-breaking career. He is the only Australian to have played at four World Cups and retired as Australia\u2019s record World Cup and Asian Cup goalscorer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
