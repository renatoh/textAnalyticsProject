All the mischief to do with recalling the brutality of 1989 and all the jibes about these current Lions cheating at the ruck and line-out and scrum carried a price heavier than just the bruises of Pom-bashing. A fuse had been lit in jest and last night it seriously exploded. A game of structured, restorative efficiency descended into a rugby hell-hole. The Lions were heading towards victory over New South Wales, and were thereby reshaping their plans and their confidence after the mishap in midweek against Australia A, when they found themselves in a whirlwind of violence. Ronan O'Gara was pinned down and struck eleven times in the face by Duncan McRae, who became the first player ever to be sent off against the tourists. McRae claimed he had been hit by a swirling arm - presumably that of O'Gara - at the clear-out after a tackle but his reaction was excessive, to say the least. His flurry of rights left the Irish outside-half bleeding profusely from a wound under his eyes. A minute later, a more general brawl broke out and yellow cards were shown to Phil Vickery and Danny Grewcock on the one side and to Cameron Blades and Brendan Cannon on the other. Bob Dwyer, coach of New South Wales, would claim afterwards that the first punch of the game had been thrown by the Lions, by Grewcock after thirty seconds. That Phil Vickery delivered another after a minute. But if this was a race to see who could pinpoint the first guilty party of the night, you would have to go some to beat the forearm driven into Grewcock's face by Tom Bowman at the kick-off. After three seconds, the Waratah second row was in the sin bin And if the violence wasn't enough, it was followed by no small measure of absurdity as New South Wales, now down to 12 in the second half after the red and yellow cards, replaced, rotated and reintroduced their forwards with the frequency of a bedroom farce. And the rugby? The Lions won comfortably enough, but it was buried beneath the layers of dirt. Dirt that may not wash off. Playfulness has been replaced by a mutual antipathy that will hardly be reduced by the prospect of three Test matches on consecutive Saturdays. Going the biff is one thing; this has the potential to go criminally wrong. At one ruck in the first half, Neil Back was kicked twice on the head. It had all started so smoothly. Bowman was off, so there was every chance to do some damage up front. Fair damage, that is, although it seems the nonsense had already started. On the legit front, the scrum went well and the line-out was much improved for a time. One such won by Grewcock, who was prominent in all, and I mean all, aspects of the game, led to a break by Brian O'Driscoll. The Irish centre, as far as I could tell, did not engage in any of the nonsense. He didn't have to; he was enjoying playing at the top of his game. He had a sublime game until the trouble set in. O'Driscoll's break was supported by Scott Quinnell, who made yard after yard with his runs. O'Driscoll was involved again. Neil Back, surprise surprise, was in support. Back to O'Driscoll for the opening try: show back on the road. Until Iain Balshaw had a flaky moment. Everyone wants to see him run, but unless he does it with absolute conviction he is going to dump the team in trouble. He tried to run out of his 22, was collared and from then on the Lions were scrambling to avoid conceding a try. They failed. Stu Pinkerton scored. A try apiece. The game was swinging along with decency. Grewcock forced a turnover and charged away with the ball. Jason Robinson scorched away for his first try as a direct result of the second row's work. How wholesome, the littlest player benefitting from the efforts of the biggest. But then Back was booted on his bonce. Will Greenwood limped off with ankle ligament damage that could turn out to be serious. Dallaglio went down clutching his right knee. The right knee. Ronan O'Gara came on. My, he must be regretting it now. Still, there was a final positive to report. Matt Dawson made a break and disappeared beneath a ruck. Jason Robinson replaced him at acting half-back. And danced through from close-range as if born to the position. The Lions led 24-5 at half time. And had been as convincing in Sydney as they had been in Brisbane. Super 12 teams were being run out of their home towns. And it would only get more painful for the NSW lot in the second half. It didn't. Then Waratahs suddenly had some positives to report. A sustained period of pressure, during which they breached the Lions defence several times, yielded two tries. Manuel Edmonds's pass after a loop around his centres may have beenforward but the try for Fran cis Cullimore was deserved. And when Sam Harris stretched out an arm from the bottom of a ruck to score again just a couple of minutes later, for all the right reasons the game was warming up. The Lions lead was down to seven points. And then it overheated. Did the Lions turn mean because they were suddenly threatened? That is sure to be an interpretation here, but McRae - he of Saracens, whose ribs were stove in by Martin Johnson, no less, before Christmas - seemed to be on a solo mission. NSW have an almost-innocent disciplinary record in the Super 12. McRae plays in England. Anyway, he chose not to exact revenge on Johnson - that would have been an act of even greater insanity - but on O'Gara, who, to be honest, is not the best street-fighter in the Lions camp. O'Gara went off to receive six stitches - plus a summons before the citing commissioner today, while McRae received his marching orders. If the Test series degenerates into an all-out horror show, Duncan McRae may go down in infamy. After that, it was a shambles. Up went the fists, out flew the blows, off went the gang of four, Grewcock, Vickery, Cannon and Blades. On and off went front-row forwards in a blur of replacement (use of) law-breaking. What the hell. Every other law of the game was being broken. Dafydd James made the game safe when the Lions won a ball against the head at a scrum. Edmonds ran in for a final try. But the sour taste could not be washed away by a token gesture to finish off with some rugby. So, what happens now? The recriminations will be hard. Whose fault is all this? How did the build-up to the clash of the titans become a back-street brawl? It's hard to say, really, but I rather suspect it all began as nothing more than a sense of mischief, that has got right out of hand. The French would immediately know what was the matter. They know better than anyone, given their volatility, what happens when rugby people lose their respect for each other. It has happened here.
