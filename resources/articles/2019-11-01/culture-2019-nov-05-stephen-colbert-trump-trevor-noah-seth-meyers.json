In other words, his move to Florida is \u201cthe old fart in the elevator then take the stairs tactic\u201d. Colbert also touched on the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry, which congressional Republicans have dismissed for weeks as secretive and unfair. But on Monday, \u201cSchiff just got real,\u201d as the chair of the intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, started releasing transcripts of the committee\u2019s closed-door testimonies. The first two transcripts released are more than 500 pages combined, \u201cthough I\u2019m sure Bill Barr can get that down to two\u201d, Colbert quipped. Trump, predictably, lashed out at Schiff and called the transcripts fraudulent propaganda. Colbert refuted that characterization: \u201cThere\u2019s a non-partisan stenographer in the room typing every word. There\u2019s not a Democratic or Republican version of the transcript any more than there\u2019s Democratic or Republican laws of physics,\u201d he said. Then, imitating the president: \u201cLook, if it was up to the Democrats, a feather and a brick would get to fall at the same acceleration rate in a vacuum, OK? That\u2019s socialism. The brick earned it, OK?\u201d Trump\u2019s furious denial meant that \u201cTrump\u2019s defenders are backed into a corner,\u201d Colbert said. And according to the Washington Post, a growing number of Republican senators are considering acknowledging Trump\u2019s quid pro quo on Ukraine. \u201cThe Republicans are so desperate, they\u2019re considering telling the truth.\u201d Trevor Noah There are a couple of issues Trump has intently focused on since taking office \u2013 \u201cthings like cutting regulations, pulling out of Iran, and legalizing flag marriage\u201d, said the Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah to a picture of Trump hugging a full-size American flag. \u201cBut the one issue he cares about more than anything else is his big, beautiful border wall.\u201d The \u201cbuild the wall\u201d chants have been ubiquitous at Trump rallies since the beginning of his campaign, and \u201cin many ways, the wall is the son Trump always wanted \u2013 taller, stronger and somehow, smarter,\u201d Noah said. Noah recapped a \u201cwall-themed\u201d weekend for Trump, who was back on his wall boasting at a rally in Tupelo, Mississippi: \u201cTrump gave his usual un-humble brag about how nothing can get through his wall. And you know how, in a sitcom, they cut right to the next scene? Well, cut right to the next scene.\u201d That scene: the same weekend, the Washington Post reported that Mexican smugglers have been sawing through a section of his wall using a \u201cpopular cordless household tool\u201d that retails for as little as $100. \u201cYep, that\u2019s right \u2013 just after Trump bragged about his super-wall, we learned that smugglers have been cutting through the new border wall with basic tools you can buy at any hardware store,\u201d Noah said. When asked how he felt about the news, Trump said he hadn\u2019t heard it but \u201cyou can cut through any wall\u201d, and bragged that he designed this wall to be \u201ceasily fixed\u201d. \u201cHold on \u2013 for four years, this guy told us the wall would be impenetrable,\u201d Noah marveled. \u201cBut now he\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, of course, you can cut through anything.\u2019 In the span of a few hours, Trump\u2019s wall went from being Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson to literally any other guy named Dwayne. \u201cAlso, if Trump is saying he built it on purpose to be something that\u2019s easy to open and then close, it isn\u2019t a wall,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cMy man, you\u2019ve built a door.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers took a closer look at Republican efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry, starting with the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who described the inquiry as \u201can unfair process driven by sore losers\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re sore losers? They won the midterms,\u201d Meyers said of House Democrats. \u201cYou guys are the ones who, whenever you lose, pass a bunch of laws making it harder to vote. That\u2019s why Republicans love voter ID and gerrymandering so much.\u201d If Republicans lose the next election, Meyers continued, they\u2019ll probably \u201cintroduce a bill mandating that all voters must have a valid driver\u2019s license in at least three different states obtained at least six business years prior to the election and the only DMV in the country is located in an abandoned hotel on a cliff in Yosemite and it\u2019s open from 1-4am on alternate Wednesdays in months beginning with the letter Q.\u201d And they\u2019ll call it, he imagined, \u201cThe Freedom to Vote Act\u201d. Meanwhile on Monday, all four White House officials scheduled to testify before the House impeachment inquiry didn\u2019t show, and other witnesses this week are reportedly planning to stonewall their subpoenas. \u201cThey\u2019re just refusing to show up now,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cHow long before Trump tries that tactic? The day he gets impeached he\u2019ll probably be holed up in his bedroom hiding under a pillow fort \u2013 \u2018You can\u2019t impeach me if you can\u2019t find me!\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
