Lawyers and accountants for the UK\u2019s richest families said they had been deluged with calls from millionaire and billionaire clients asking for help and advice on moving countries, shifting their fortunes offshore and making early gifts to their children to avoid the Labour leader\u2019s threat to tax all inheritances above \u00a3125,000. The advisers said a Corbyn-led government was viewed as a far greater threat to the wealth and quality of life of the richest 1% than a hard Brexit. Geoffrey Todd, a partner at the law firm Boodle Hatfield, said many of his clients had already put plans in place to transfer their wealth out of the country within minutes if Corbyn is elected. \u201cLots of high-net worth individuals are worried about having to pay much higher taxes on their wealth and have already prepared for the possibility of a Corbyn government,\u201d he said. \u201cTransfers of wealth are already arranged \u2013 in many cases, all that is missing is a signature on the contract. \u201cThere will be plenty of people on the phone to their lawyers in the early hours of 13 December if Labour wins. Movements of capital to new owners and different locations are already prepared, and they are just awaiting final approval.\u201d Dominic Samuelson, the chief executive of Campden Wealth, which advises more than 3,500 rich families, said: \u201cFrom the ultra-high net worth perspective, a Labour government under Corbyn is a much greater threat to them and their businesses and their wealth than Brexit.\u201d On Thursday, Corbyn singled out five members of \u201cthe elite\u201d that a Labour government would go after in order to rebalance the country. He claimed Mike Ashley, the billionaire owner of Sports Direct and Newcastle United, was a \u201cbad boss\u201d who exploited his workers through zero-hours contracts. Ashley hit back, telling the Financial Times: \u201cCorbyn\u2019s not only a liar but clueless.\u201d The Labour leader also named the \u201cgreedy banker\u201d Crispin Odey, the hedge fund manager who made \u00a3220m betting against the pound in the run-up to the EU referendum. Odey responded by telling the Daily Telegraph: \u201cLuckily they [Labour] can\u2019t even run a campaign, let alone the country.\u201d The others singled out by Corbyn were: Jim Ratcliffe, the chemicals billionaire who has left the UK for tax-free Monaco; the Sun and Sunday Times owner, Rupert Murdoch; and the Duke of Westminster, who has a large central London property empire. The shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis went further than the Labour leader, telling the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme: \u201cBillionaires shouldn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a travesty that there are people on this planet living on less than a dollar a day. \u201cThere are people, when I walk into parliament, who are sleeping rough on the streets of this country \u2013 the sixth-wealthiest in this world.\u201d He also described private schools as \u201cengines of inequality\u201d. Josie Hills, a senior tax manager at Pinsent Masons, said not being able to educate their children at Eton, Harrow or Winchester was a key worry for many of the law firm\u2019s rich clients, who were considering moving to Switzerland and other low-tax countries with well-regarded private schools. \u201cI would say 80% of our clients have thought about the implications of a Corbyn government,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tend to say they sincerely hope it won\u2019t happen but they want to be ready if it does. If that means uprooting themselves and their families then so be it.\u201d John Caudwell, the billionaire founder of Phones4u, has already vowed to leave the country if Corbyn becomes prime minister. Caudwell, who has an estimated \u00a31.6bn fortune, said a Corbyn-led government would be \u201ca complete fiasco\u201d and he would \u201cjust go and live in the south of France or Monaco\u201d. Corbyn has not set out precisely how he would target the rich, but Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto pledged to impose a 45p tax rate on those earning more than \u00a380,000 and a 50% rate above \u00a3123,000. At present, the highest income tax rate is 45% for those earning more than \u00a3150,000. Labour would also significantly increase capital gains tax and might replace inheritance tax with a \u201clifetime gifts\u201d levy, with a tax-free allowance of \u00a3125,000 \u2013 less than half the current \u00a3325,000. There are also plans to increase the corporation tax rate to 26%, up from the current rate of 19%. Corbyn\u2019s plans for workers\u2019 rights, with ideas floated including a four-day working week and giving employees 10% of the shares of big firms, are also of concern to the wealthy. Peter Hargreaves, who has an estimated fortune of \u00a33bn and co-founded the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, warned Corbyn\u2019s plans would be an \u201cown goal and leave the country much worse off\u201d. He added: \u201cIt has been proven time and time again: there is only so much you can tax a nation before the tax take starts to go down because people will leave. My family will not be leaving, I love this country and I have always been enormously patriotic. \u201cBut certainly the very, very wealthy people will consider leaving if you make it intolerable. People are petrified of him [Corbyn], and what he might do.\u201d Hargreaves said the stockbroker employed about 1,700 people and had \u201ccreated a vast amount of wealth for this country\u201d. He added: \u201cIf you create a tax regime that is not going to welcome and support people like me who create wealth then you are going to rapidly reduce the health of your economy.\u201d Hargreaves said he paid about \u00a340m in tax last year, and \u201cif 50 of us [the biggest taxpayers] got on a plane and left, that would put a big hole in the chancellor\u2019s budget\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2019. An earlier version implied that Labour would replace inheritance tax with a \u201clifetime gifts levy\u201d. That should have said that Labour might do that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
