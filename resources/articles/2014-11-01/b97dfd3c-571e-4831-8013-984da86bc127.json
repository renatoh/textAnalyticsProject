Quite apart from ending Mourinho\u2019s record of 77 Premier League home games without defeat during his two stints in charge at Stamford Bridge courtesy of a 2-1 victory in west London in April, Sunderland also knocked Chelsea out of last season\u2019s Capital One Cup at the quarter-final stage. Considering that a couple of weeks earlier Poyet\u2019s struggling side narrowly lost their home league game against Mourinho\u2019s side 4-3 the stage seems set for an upset on Wearside. But Sunderland\u2019s manager urges caution. \u201cThis is a different Chelsea \u2013 a better and stronger one than last season,\u201d said the former Stamford Bridge midfielder. \u201cThey are unbeaten in the Premier League and the best team in the country by far. They were strong title favourites before the season started and now they\u2019re even bigger favourites.\u201d Poyet asked his old friend and one-time Chelsea team-mate Roberto Di Matteo for advice in the aftermath of Mourinho\u2019s side thrashing Di Matteo\u2019s Schalke in the Champions League this week but little was forthcoming. \u201cIt was a perfect Chelsea performance,\u201d Poyet said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope they\u2019re not perfect against us. It\u2019s going to be difficult but it\u2019s a great chance and we\u2019re the ones with the opportunity to end their unbeaten League run this season. Let\u2019s try. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going for three wins against Jos\u00e9. We\u2019re usually on the wrong end of stats and haven\u2019t beaten someone for about 50 years but now we\u2019re on the right side so let\u2019s enjoy it a bit. It\u2019s a game I\u2019d love to play in.\u201d Not that Di Matteo exactly identified too many flaws in Mourinho\u2019s side. \u201cI told my friend \u2019come on show me the way\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Roberto didn\u2019t. He said Chelsea defend better than any team in Europe. They defend better than Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say if they can go unbeaten all season because there\u2019s such a long way to go but if there\u2019s one team who can do it, then it\u2019s probably Chelsea. They are special and unique and really strong and if they keep everyone fit they\u2019re going to be close to staying unbeaten. They\u2019re going to win the title without losing, or maybe losing only once.\u201d At least Poyet remains one manager with first hand experience of Mourinho the loser. \u201cHe\u2019s always one of the best,\u201d he said. \u201cHe congratulated us after we won there last season. I\u2019ve always had a great relationship with Jos\u00e9 \u2013 we\u2019ve never had a bad word. In the past he\u2019s welcomed me to their training ground.\u201d After witnessing only two League wins this season, Sunderland fans would embrace a rare victory which might help assuage fears of another relegation skirmish. \u201cPeople are talking about a relegation battle between 13 teams,\u201d acknowledged Poyet. \u201cSo we need to take our opportunities.\u201d His critics wonder whether a manager who has not named the same team twice in succession this season is proving his own worst enemy. \u201cSomeone\u2019s just told me I\u2019m the new Tinkerman,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that and I hate being called it. \u201cI hated it at Chelsea when the manager always tinkered. It\u2019s called squad rotation but I hate that.\u201d So why employ it at Sunderland? \u201cFrom Saturday to Saturday if the team does well the team should stay the same,\u201d said Poyet who has been disappointed by the failure of certain players including Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson to hit top form this term. \u201cBut you need to perform well to make sure that happens.\u201d With Chelsea\u2019s visit followed by Wednesday\u2019s home game against Manchester City and next Saturday\u2019s trip to Liverpool, his players could not pick a better week to start impressing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
