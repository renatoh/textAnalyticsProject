I had always loved swimming but had to give it up until my mother bought some Lycra fabric from Lincraft and sewed me a fluorescent pink-and-blue two-piece wetsuit with a matching swimming cap. The local pools refused to admit me wearing the suit but I was free to go to the beach. So go to the beach I did. And yet the feeling that I belonged at the beach, that it was a public space in which I was \u201cin place\u201d, sometimes eluded me. The belief that the beach is open to all runs deep in Australia. Wendy Garden, the curator of last year\u2019s art exhibition On the Beach, wrote that beaches occupied \u201ca privileged place in the national psyche\u201d. \u201cThe beach is seen as a great equaliser, where racial, social and gender differences are subordinate to the common pursuit of pleasure in the surf and sun.\u201d But like many of our public spaces, the iconic space of the Australian beach has always privileged a white sensory landscape. What looks and feels and sounds and smells as though it belongs is a function of power relations. Since last summer, events in Europe have sharpened potential conflicts over who and what belongs on the beach. After the terrorist attack in Nice in May, French mayors banned women from wearing burkinis on the beach in dozens of resorts and promised to defy a court ruling that the bans were illegal. At least one woman was fined by police for not wearing an outfit deemed to respect \u201cgood morals and secularism\u201d. No such legal moves have been seriously proposed for Australian beaches but the climate is far from relaxed. Speaking to Muslim women from diverse walks of life about their relationship with the beach, what is striking is how their bodies, specifically their dress, have become the dominant site for contests over what is considered \u201cin place\u201d and \u201cout of place\u201d on Australian beaches. Whether it be a hijab over a rash vest and activewear leggings, or the burkini, it seems that the \u201cMuslimness\u201d of this form of dress has the capacity to provoke wary and sometimes hostile reactions. Many of the women I spoke to had a sense that their burkinis and hijabs were considered \u201cout of place\u201d. The staring, the double looks, the raised eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s this feeling that the beach and hijab don\u2019t mix,\u201d says Sarah, a 28-year-old lawyer (all interviewees asked for full names to be withheld). \u201cPeople are locked into thinking there\u2019s only one way to dress and enjoy the beach.\u201d Samah laughs when she tells me that before owning a burkini, she wore tights, a long shirt and hijab to swim in and \u201clay on the sand\u201d. \u201cOne time a guy looked at me while we were in the water,\u201d she recounts. \u201cHe shook his head with pity and said, \u2018Isn\u2019t it a shame you can\u2019t enjoy the sun?\u2019 I laughed it off and responded that I was enjoying the sun. \u201cMind you, the guy was wearing a long-sleeve rashie and swim cap. I had more skin exposed than he did!\u201d Growing up in Queensland, the beach has always been part of Aisha\u2019s life. But when she started wearing hijab, she says she stopped feeling comfortable because of \u201chow people would stare\u201d. She opted for secluded beaches despite her concerns about swimming in places with no flags or lifeguards. \u201cIt was the only way I could feel at ease to swim,\u201d she says. For some the beach has become the opposite of the peculiarly relaxed space of Australian myth. Hana, a 25-year-old journalist, was on the northern beaches of Sydney last month and interpreted the stares she received as a kind of \u201cdisgust\u201d that questioned her right even to be on the beach. She says she decided against wearing her burkini and \u201cwatered down\u201d her outfit of swimming cap, black tights with board shorts on top and long-sleeve rash vest, to make it less \u201cconfronting\u201d. \u201cI can go anywhere in Australia and I feel so comfortable,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the beach is the one place that I am fearful of because of the reaction I always receive.\u201d The norms and rules that have been allowed to dominate Australian beaches mean a bathing suit is internalised as natural, much in the same way that in India it is perfectly \u201cnatural\u201d for women to wear saris and swim in the ocean. In Egypt, women jump into the Mediterranean wearing their hijabs or niqabs without issue. Another woman, Az, says it is not the job of Muslim women to prove they belong on Australian beaches. What is needed is to hold the mirror up to society and understand why we deem some forms of dress acceptable and others unacceptable. Yet many Muslim women do struggle to overcome the attitudes of others. Sana spent years on what she describes as \u201ca journey of confidence-building\u201d to wear a burkini at the beach. For years she chose not to wear it because she grew up \u201cwith a feeling that only people who dress and look a certain way have claim to the beach. The beach is a space which, due to so many societal factors, is synonymous with whiteness, blond-haired, sunburnt-white skin and definitely not fully dressed women.\u201d This is about much more than bikinis v burkinis. Muslim women are particularly aware that what they wear on the beach and how they behave can be used as ammunition for wider culture wars about a mythical \u201cAustralian way of life\u201d and \u201cAussie values\u201d. Anisa is married with three children and her concerns about being a \u201chijabi at the beach\u201d have deepened since the French bans. \u201cSome women are brave and don\u2019t care,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I feel so self-conscious and as though people are judging me and my husband because he\u2019s wearing \u2018appropriate\u2019 swimwear whereas I am fully covered. \u201cYou can almost feel how they are viewing us as this controlling Muslim man and his poor oppressed wife \u2013 if only they knew the real dynamics!\u201d A cultural studies professor, Suvendini Perera, has argued that veiling has become the ultimate marker of cultural difference and that the veiled Muslim woman is \u201ca kind of limit-figure for the nation in the values debate\u201d. It is the awareness that their bodies are repositories for other people\u2019s narratives and stereotypes that burdens all the women I spoke to. And yet many Muslim women resist the negative responses of others to lay claim to their beach space. Abs tells me she \u201cself-counsels\u201d herself: \u201cI constantly tell myself not to care what others are thinking of my appearance. This self-counselling empowers me to enjoy myself and my time with my children.\u201d Samar is just as resolved to ignore the \u201cstares and weird looks\u201d and \u201crock the burkini when I\u2019m swimming\u201d. For Layla, for whom the beach \u201cwashes away stress and anxiety\u201d, presumptions that she cannot swim and is \u201cweighed down\u201d by her burkini only make her laugh. It\u2019s not simply that these women use the beach in spite of being positioned as \u201cout of place\u201d. They seek to redefine \u201cout of place\u201d, challenging dominant assumptions and sensory reactions to their presence. Layla\u2019s relationship with the beach has evolved from a site of resistance to the staring and comments, to a place which she says she has \u201ctrained myself to think of as my space too\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
