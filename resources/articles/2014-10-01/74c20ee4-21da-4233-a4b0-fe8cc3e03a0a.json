A six-month investigation into the prawn supply chain, which found that severely abused slaves on boats in Thailand were used to help fish for produce destined for high street brands around the world, won in two categories: best investigation into forced labour, reported by Kate Hodal, Chris Kelly and Felicity Lawrence; and best documentary on slavery, reported by the same team and directed and produced by Chris Kelly, Maggie O\u2019Kane, and Mary Carson. Pete Pattisson won the best news award for his investigation into forced labour and deaths among Nepalese migrants enslaved in Qatar, where they are building infrastructure for the World Cup. Both investigations are part of the Guardian\u2019s Modern-day slavery in focus project, edited by Lucy Lamble and Annie Kelly. Anthony Steen, chairman of the Human Trafficking Foundation, emphasised the part the media can play in raising awareness of the nature and extent of modern-day slavery in the UK, and in bringing modern-day slavery to the top of the political agenda. Steen said: \u201cThe media has an important task to play to ensure the government is left in no doubt what [William] Wilberforce\u2019s legacy demands.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
