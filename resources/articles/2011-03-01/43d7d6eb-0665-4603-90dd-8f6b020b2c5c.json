The substitute striker capitalised on defensive nerves which undid much good second-half work from Tony Mowbray's slowly improving side. With Julio Arca impressing in Boro's midfield a victory that would have eased relegation fears seemed in touching distance until Adebola's intervention boosted Forest's promotion hopes by lifting them to fourth. \"A cruel result, we deserved to win; their keeper made six decent saves,\" Mowbray said. \"But then the ball was lumped into the box in the 93rd minute and defenders made poor decisions. It's happened to better teams than us but although my players are distraught we've shown we can more than match Forest. We're inexperienced and inconsistent but we're not as bad as our league position suggests.\" Davies did not disagree. \"A great result but we didn't deserve it,\" Forest's manager said. \"Boro were better. I apologised to Tony afterwards.\" For much of the first half fifth-bottom Middlesbrough appeared to be playing a particularly tortuous game of snakes and ladders in front of the Riverside's acres of empty red seats. No one could deny that Mowbray's men worked incredibly hard to win possession but, almost as soon as they had seized the ball, Boro invariably returned it. Although Davies's ensemble were not exactly cohesive, their hosts enjoyed quite a reprieve as Luke Chambers shot wide when well placed in the wake of Jason Steele's misreading of a Chris Gunter free-kick. After that Forest regressed and, with Arca helping to up the fluency and possession retention levels, a slight swagger entered Boro's step. Lee Camp had earlier been required to make routine saves from Arca and Barry Robson but the Forest keeper earned real plaudits when diverting Andrew Taylor's 20-yard volley for a corner. Davies's team arrived on Teesside having won only one of their previous five league games and he must have been relieved to have Camp on his side here. If the keeper's best moment saw him somehow repel Tony McMahon's curling 25-yard shot even he had no answer to Scott McDonald's 51st-minute strike. With the visiting defence wrong-footed by Leroy Lita's sudden acceleration into the area the forward picked out Robson, whose low cross was scuffed by Arca but fell kindly for McDonald to finish. As McDonald's strike powered past Camp, Forest rued their failure to mark him at the back post. Neglecting to learn a lesson, Davies's defence then left Arca in ample space only for Camp to perform further heroics. \"We needed a second goal,\" Mowbray lamented. Without it they remained horribly vulnerable to that late high punt, a challenge won by Wes Morgan and Adebola's opportunism in bundling the ball home. Meanwhile Forest \u2013 who Davies claimed are \"a good bet for the play-offs\" \u2013 look ill equipped for Premier League life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
