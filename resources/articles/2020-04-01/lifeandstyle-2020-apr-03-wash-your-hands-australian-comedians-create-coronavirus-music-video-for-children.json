Perhaps comedian Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr can help. She\u2019s has teamed up with comedy duo The Listies (Richard Higgins and Matt Kelly) to create Wash Your Hands: a song and video clip aimed at both entertaining and educating kids in the importance of cleaning one\u2019s paws. Coombs Marr told Guardian Australia the song was partly a product of isolation. \u201cSo, basically The Listies and I were shut in our rooms, and wanted to kill some time by doing a fun little hand-washing song for kids,\u201d Coombs Marr said. The team, like so many in the world presently, began collaborating over video chat. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty simple message \u2013 wash those hands! But then over a couple of Zooms, it got kind of Live Aid-epic. So we got music whiz Ryan Ritchie onboard, and then, since Gal Godot and all her mates were doing it, we figured what the world REALLY needs right now is another video of celebrities singing to their phones. So we did a ring-around,\u201d she said. The song features cameos from Frank Woodley, Kate Mclennan and Kate McCartney of Get Krack!n\u2019 fame, Susie Youssef, Julia Zemiro, Adam Hills, Tom Ballard and more. \u201cI\u2019ve never done kids comedy before, so we did have a few \u2018creative differences\u2019,\u201d Coombs Marr said. Those creative differences became a feature of the clip. \u201cZoe, have you ever done any kids\u2019 comedy before?\u201d asks Higgins in the opening sequence. \u201cNo, I do esoteric meta-comedy about gender and the politics of space,\u201d Coombs Marr replies. \u201cAnd also fart jokes.\u201d \u201cPerfect!\u201d The song already has its fans: one young fan even recorded his own version and posted it to Instagram. \u201cWe\u2019re told the kids are ROFLing,\u201d Coombs Marr said. \u201cWe\u2019re basically saving the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
