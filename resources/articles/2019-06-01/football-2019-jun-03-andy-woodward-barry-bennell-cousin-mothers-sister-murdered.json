He wasn\u2019t feeling great, was the truth. He wanted to find a bit of peace and he wanted to be in a place where he could remember a time in his life when everything felt so much more innocent. His old primary school was pulled down a few years ago to make way for a housing estate. But the playing fields are still in use and it was here, as a 10-year-old, that he remembers bringing the ball out of defence, playing for his first junior football team, and trying a shot from the halfway line. The ball flew into the top corner and his father, Terry, ran on the pitch to give him a hug. And now, more than 35 years on, something drew Andy back to that same spot. He found a place to sit under a tree and stayed there for longer than he could even remember, lost in his own thoughts. When he turns up for lunch the next day his mother, Jean, drops him off. We have a hug and he tells me he is OK. And he is, I hope \u2013 at least, as far as can be expected when you stop to think about the reasons why he lives with post-traumatic stress disorder. On the surface, he seems OK-ish. It is what goes on beneath the surface, in common with all Barry Bennell\u2019s victims, that worries me. Andy has his own analogy for it. \u201cIt\u2019s like being chained to a wolf. Every day, I\u2019m chained to this huge, terrifying beast. It never leaves me. Sometimes you might feel like you have tamed it, that you have got it under control and everything\u2019s fine. But you\u2019re kidding yourself. Then something happens and it\u2019s baring its teeth again. And when it bites you, it bites you hard.\u201d At the last count, Operation Hydrant, the specialist police unit investigating the sexual abuse of children in football, had received 2,807 referrals since Andy waived his anonymity, in November 2016, to detail his shattering experiences as a boy in Crewe Alexandra\u2019s youth system and set off what the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as a \u201ctidal wave\u201d. Clarke called it the biggest crisis in the history of the sport and the police statistics are mind-boggling: 300 suspects identified, 849 victims and 340 clubs named. Except those figures have not been updated since March 2018 and will be much higher now. Bennell, as a direct result, is serving a 31-year prison sentence with the possibility of another criminal trial next year for the man described by a judge as \u201cthe devil incarnate\u201d. As of January 2018, at least 97 others had reported him on the back of Andy\u2019s interview \u2013 though, again, that number is likely to be substantially higher now. Without Andy, none of this would have happened and Bennell, in theory, would still be living in Milton Keynes, going by the name of Richard Jones and working locally as a laptop repairer. Yet it goes wider than that. Almost every time another of football\u2019s paedophiles appears in court \u2013 Bob Higgins, George Ormond, William Toner, Jim McCafferty, James Torbett, Gerald King, Frank Cairney, Norman Shaw and on and on \u2013 Andy\u2019s story has been cited as the reason why victims were emboldened to come forward. Plus it has gone viral now: other footballers or former footballers speaking about their own ordeals and triggering movements in Australia, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. All of it comes back to the man sitting in front of me for this interview. That doesn\u2019t change the fact, however, that every day is a battle, or that it is not the life he, or anybody, would have wanted. As a boy, Andy was raped more times than he can possibly remember, but certainly in the hundreds. Terry, who had motor neurone disease, died last August. Jean, a tremendously stoic woman, has been fighting cancer. Bennell \u2013 cynical, controlling and predatory - had become part of the Woodward family, marrying Andy\u2019s sister, before his luck ran out. It is a struggle for Andy and all the family sometimes. Of course it is. Plus there is another element to this story that, until now, we deliberately held back. A secret that goes back to the day we met in 2016 when he told me what had happened to his aunt, Lynda, and we decided it was better, at that time, to keep it out of print. Mostly to spare his mum any more anguish when Andy\u2019s interview was already going to be seismic enough. But also because it was not the sort of thing that could be squashed into a couple of paragraphs in a much wider piece. Lynda was 22, Jean\u2019s older sister, when she went out one Friday night in 1970 to the Princess hotel in Fallowfield, south Manchester. She was also seven months pregnant and when she missed the bus she and a friend decided to walk home, saying goodbye on Kingsway, a dual-carriageway running in and out of the city. \u201cLynda\u2019s body was discovered the next morning in the garden of number 285,\u201d Andy takes up the story. \u201cShe\u2019d been dragged through a hedge, raped, bitten and then beaten to death. She was just a few minutes\u2019 walk from home.\u201d Andy was born three years later and, growing up, he says the murder was never spoken about. \u201cIt was something awful to be buried, kept out of sight. Mum used to break down sometimes when we were kids: shaking and crying, Dad holding her tight. But it was only later I found out those tears were for her sister.\u201d He can understand now why his mum found it easier to cope by not talking about it, and why the police called it one of the most shocking murders they had ever dealt with. \u201cIt was so violent and it seemed like there was no explanation for it. It was random and unbelievably savage. An unborn baby died that night, too. It was a completely unprovoked, opportunist attack. The guy was a psychopath, no question.\u201d The killer left a ring at the scene, engraved with his name, and the police matched up the bootprints and teeth-marks. His name was Ronald Bennell, an 18-year-old apprentice engineer who was sentenced to life in prison but got out after 12 years and, in 1989, murdered again. The victim that time was a mum-of-three, Pamela Noone, 42, walking through the park under the Seven Arches viaduct in Bramhall, near Stockport. He raped her as well. He was arrested and, a few weeks later, he hanged himself on remand at Strangeways. By then, Andy was 16 and still being abused at the football club where various first-teamers called him \u201cBarry\u2019s bum-boy\u201d, opposition players referred to Crewe as the \u201cpaedo club\u201d and he says the manager, Dario Gradi, once walked in on him, aged 13, sitting on the knee of the youth-team coach, without apparently thinking it necessary to ask what was going on. That, however, tells only part of the story. Andy\u2019s older sister, Lynda \u2013 named after their aunt \u2013 had been dating his abuser for the previous two years. The wedding took place in 1991 and Andy had to go through the hellish ordeal of seeing the man who had exploited, controlled and abused him for years becoming his brother-in-law. Photographs from the day show the church filled with Bennell\u2019s young victims, all living their own secrets. Andy, I note, is not smiling on any of the pictures. Bennell is though. \u201cI remember him grinning at me when he walked down the aisle to say his vows with my sister. He had it all \u2026 and here he was, getting away with it. Celebrating a wedding? For him, it was a celebration of his power over everyone there.\u201d It was 1994 when the truth emerged and Bennell was sent to prison for seven years for raping a 13-year-old boy on a tour to Florida. What nobody had ever done was make the connection between the two men \u2013 one dead, another in prison \u2013 who had shattered Andy\u2019s family and the fact they had the same surnames. Until, that is, the police pieced it all together. And this, I suppose, is possibly the most shocking part of this entire story. Barry Bennell and Ronald Bennell were cousins, separated by two years. One a cold-blooded murderer, the other described by the police among the worst paedophiles, numbers-wise, in UK criminal history. \u201c[Barry] Bennell would have known what his cousin did, I\u2019m 100% sure,\u201d Andy says, and for the first time there is a crack of emotion in his voice. \u201cI can only think he took some kind of twisted pleasure out of it: knowing what we didn\u2019t. He even took me to where his cousin lived, visiting his auntie and uncle \u2013 Ronald\u2019s mum and dad. There was a picture on the wall of a young man with dark hair and I remember this old couple kept referring to \u2018Ronnie\u2019. I didn\u2019t know who he was, or why he wasn\u2019t there. But I know now that the face on the wall was Ronald Bennell.\u201d The story is told in full in the autobiography, Position of Trust, that Andy brings out on Thursday, and the book is certainly an eye-opener for anyone who might have presumed his life had dramatically changed for the better since he, a former pro at Crewe, Bury and Sheffield United, sat down with me for the first time, two and a half years ago, and asked for the Guardian\u2019s help to persuade others to speak out. True, there is immense satisfaction about the number of people he has helped and, recalling some of the conversations with other abuse victims, the lives he may have saved. He will always be grateful for the kindness he has been shown. But the emotional damage is catastrophic and will never go away. Plus he has experienced the worst of the social-media era and, in some cases, it has been downright sinister. The time, for example, he checked his Twitter account a few days after going public and there was a message from an account using Bennell\u2019s name and photograph. \u201cHi Andy. Am feeling horny. Fancy popping round mine?\u201d it read, attached to a clip of a man sucking a lollipop. It turned out it was some troll from Crewe who ended up in court and, together with his dad, got sent down for perverting the course of justice. But Andy wasn\u2019t to know that at the time. \u201cBennell hadn\u2019t been locked up by that stage. As far as I knew, that was him coming after me. I could feel the panic rising through my body. I just dropped to the floor. Even the possibility it was him tipped me over the edge.\u201d Another time, Andy looked through his friend requests on Facebook and found one from Richard Barry, another of Bennell\u2019s aliases. \u201cWhat did he want from me? Did he really think we could be friends? Or was there some other sinister reason? I guess I will never know. How do you read a mind that twisted, anyway? As always with Bennell, I imagine it was about control.\u201d Bennell, now 65, ended up being convicted of 50 specimen charges of raping and molesting 12 boys, aged eight to 15, on countless occasions in the junior setups of Crewe and Manchester City, from 1979 to 1991. Yet Andy missed the first four weeks of the trial because he was on a 30-day residency at the Sporting Chance clinic. He came out like a new man \u2013 booze-free, practising yoga, running every morning. Then he sat through the last week of the trial and, to use his analogy, the wolf started baring its teeth again. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d he says. \u201cYou think you have it under control and then, bang, it takes another great bite out of you.\u201d Since then, his marriage has fallen apart and, though he always seems to have a smile for everyone, he has spent some long, harrowing periods in a whirl of extreme depression, suffering anxiety and panic attacks. His drinking is under control now but there was a point, a few years back, that \u201cif it was not alcoholism it was somewhere close\u201d. Gary Speed\u2019s death sent him on a \u201clong spiral\u201d \u2013 the young Speed also used to stay overnight with Bennell, though it is not a subject Andy or the other players like to speak about publicly \u2013 and Andy will openly admit there have been times when he has been suicidal or referred to a crisis team on a mental health unit. When I ask whether he imagines Crewe might ever apologise, the look on his face tells me: stupid question. He tried to sue for damages in 2004 but, with nobody to back him up, lost his case. At which point, he says, he can remember the club\u2019s lawyers high-fiving in front of him. In particular \u2013 and this is hugely important \u2013 he wants to analyse Crewe\u2019s line that they never received any complaints about Bennell and that the only reason the man described in court as \u201can industrial-scale child molester\u201d lost his job was because he did not follow specific instructions in a coaching session. Crewe\u2019s former managing director, Hamilton Smith, has claimed the club did receive warnings and Andy believes him. \u201cBennell was a machine for Crewe,\u201d Andy says. \u201cHe found them brilliant young footballers, he was one of the best in the business, the \u2018Star-maker\u2019 and the players he discovered made this small, hard-up club huge amounts of money. The idea that they moved him out because of a tactical disagreement over a coaching session is, frankly, an insult to people\u2019s intelligence. \u201cI know what happened because he was living with my sister at the time. He came home one night and started crying because he said he had been told he couldn\u2019t have kids staying with him any longer. My sister told him he would have to stop if his job was on the line. \u2018No,\u2019 he said. He carried on. And at weekends, when he had the boys staying, he would pack my sister off to stay with mum and dad so he had the house free.\u201d The thing about Andy is that, despite everything, he isn\u2019t angry with the world. He is getting by, he says. He has just paid for his mum to have a new kitchen and feeling very proud about it. Very proud of his book, too. He is helping to put together an app called Depresson, which will support people with mental health issues and promote safeguarding, and he is a brilliant public speaker when it comes to sharing his experiences with football clubs, academies and other organisations. People stop him in the street to thank him for what he has done (my favourite being Barbara Knox, Rita from Coronation Street, grabbing his arm in Waitrose). But there is no getting away from it: it\u2019s tough. The next time we arrange to meet it is up by the playing fields near Bruntwood Park where, all those years ago, a football-mad kid scored from the halfway line and got a hug from his dad as the reward. There is a footpath running behind those fields and, on the way, he confesses he has made this walk hundreds of times. He points out the tree where he sits. Then he leans on the fence and for the next few minutes I let him cry it out. Position of Trust by Andy Woodward is published on Thursday by Coronet (\u00a317.99).
