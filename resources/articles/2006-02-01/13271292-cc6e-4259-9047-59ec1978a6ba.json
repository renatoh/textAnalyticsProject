I have unexpectedly lost two family members on opposite sides of the United States. Needless to say, computer games haven't been on my mind. And most games don't deal with the concept of bereavement and death in a particularly grownup way. After all, they are intended to distract and entertain. Inflicting loss of life is regularly the purpose or at least part of the pleasure, and interactive city streets are littered with the detritus of an armed rampage. Bereavement in games has really only reared its head in two titles: Final Fantasy VII and the Silent Hill series. The former is regularly cited as one of the most emotional products to emerge in interactive entertainment. Many gamers openly admit to crying when the character Aeris dies. Most games feature cliched storytelling in which characters die heroically while brandishing weapons. Aeris's death is unexpected, and the feeling that she has been taken wrongly is surprisingly profound. The loss seems senseless, paralleling the experience of many real-life bereavements. Even more unusual is how her death is portrayed - a pearl rolls down a flight of stairs - which in the over-the-top world of videogaming is a welcome subtle approach to the inner self. The Silent Hill series, on the other hand, recreates the cacophonous emotional earthquake that often follows the loss of a loved one. The plots twist the psychological plights of men trying to come to terms with the deaths of close family, and throw them into nightmarish scenarios filled with horrifying obstacles. In one game, the main character fruitlessly chases the spectre of his missing daughter through zombie-infested schoolhouses, and in another, he desperately tries to save the doppelganger of his recently deceased wife from an onslaught of the undead. While Final Fantasy tries to adapt the symbolism of Battleship Potemkin, Silent Hill borrows liberally from Jacob's Ladder and Don't Look Now. To date, few games have adequately captured the poignancy and the turmoil of real-life emotions. Sorrow, joy and anger are notably absent from interactive experiences, a feature often raised in the eternal battle between games and other mainstream media. Late last year, American film critic Roger Ebert dismissed games for this reason, and while he received an impressive backlash from gamer geeks from around the world, his rationale remains solid. Yet it is accepted in the offices of top-flight publishers and research firms that tapping the emotional font is necessary for games if they wish to continue in their bullish trend. Console game makers can learn from other genres. Online games are great examples of how human beings connect via computer, and use the digital spaces to work through offline issues. After the 7/7 bombings in London, memorials were set up in many online games for players to come together and share their experiences of shock and loss. When actor Christopher Reeve died in late 2004, players in the superhero game City of Heroes recognised their loss by donning Superman outfits and witnessing a moment of silence. More recently, when a game friend died in the real world, players in World of Warcraft had an online funeral to collectively commemorate their loss. Videogames are played by people, not machines. There is room for emotions in entertainment. Films do it, why can't games? It's not impossible, but developers may need more experienced storytellers to harness their emotional impact. The challenge is to capture the truth in the turmoil surrounding death that goes beyond the need for revenge. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
