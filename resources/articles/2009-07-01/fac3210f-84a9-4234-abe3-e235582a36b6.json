The answer is the fine local wine from south-west France, for at the finish of the three-day teams event at the Biarritz festival of bridge, the ranking list began like this: 1 Mme Green, Green, Mme Turner, Turner 2 Mme Lavazza, Bocchi, Madala, Sementa, Buboin Martin Turner and his wife Helga live in Cornwall; Nick and Marian Green live in France. This was the first major tournament any of them had attended. In fact the teams tournament in Biarritz includes a handicapping system under which world champions play off scratch while lesser-known players receive a bonus in terms of Victory Points. Nonetheless, it is the performance of a lifetime. Thanks to Martin Turner for today's deal from the tournament. East-West vulnerable, dealer North. West made the normal but unfortunate opening lead of the nine of diamonds, which Martin Turner ducked in dummy. East mysteriously also played low, and declarer won with the 10. A spade to the K and a spade to the J brought good news and bad \u2013 the Q was well placed, but also well guarded. Having to avoid the loss of two club tricks to go with a spade and a diamond, Martin next ran the eight of clubs to East's 10. The defender was helpless now \u2013 he cashed the ace of diamonds, but then could not move. A spade would allow South to avoid a trump loser, a club would give away that suit, and his actual choice of a heart meant that declarer could throw both his losing clubs on dummy's ace and queen of hearts. There's only one word for that \u2013 bien jou\u00e9."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
