They have so dominated the season that they appear to have been inhabiting some Premiership antechamber and now, with a handful of fixtures to go, they will confirm their promotion if they win today. The leaders Portsmouth are at home to struggling Sheffield Wednesday while Leicester travel to Rotherham. Promotion for both is beyond doubt. But will they struggle in the Premiership, like so many before? Leicester's financial problems led to them being placed in administration last year, following relegation from the elite. Portsmouth have already spent substantially on wages after eight of the previous nine seasons in the bottom eight of the First Division, surviving only on the last day of the season in 1996, 1998 and 2000. The Pompey manager Harry Redknapp has laid out the better part of \u00a310m investing in experience but his chairman Milan Mandaric, who claims to have lost \u00a360m since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, does not have bottomless pockets. No one is better qualified to judge the merits of Leicester and Portsmouth than Neil Warnock, who manages the third-placed Sheffield United. Warnock, taking a day off from the First Division to concentrate on tomorrow's FA Cup semi-final with Arsenal, said: \"Leicester are better organised and more physical. They grind teams down. But Portsmouth have better quality in a lot of areas. \"I like Leicester's Jordan Stewart, and Muzzy Izzet even more. He is the best midfield player in the division. But Portsmouth have the edge and, if I had to put my hat on it, I'd say they will shade the championship and do better in the Premiership next season. \"Everyone knows what Paul Merson can do and I'm also a big admirer of Matthew Taylor and, up front, Svetoslav Todorov. Leicester are very similar to the team that went down. That said, their manager Micky Adams is aware he will have to bring in a number of quality performers, so judgments about next season would be premature.\" Ronnie Moore, whose Rotherham face Leicester today, agrees with Warnock, saying: \"Portsmouth will win the title. They have more match-winning players. Leicester are big and strong, though anyone who dismisses them as just a long-ball side is wrong - with Izzet they have much more to offer than that.\" Chris Turner, manager of Wednesday, said: \"Portsmouth are the best side we've played this season, a footballing side, while Leicester are well drilled. But both could struggle in the Premiership. I can't see any new players from either side coming through and making an impression in the Premiership.\" Merson, Portsmouth's best known player, is certain Redknapp will have to keep opening his chequebook. He said: \"We need to buy a few players. I'm 35 and a few of the others, like Shaka Hislop and Tim Sherwood, are in their middle 30s. I don't think we're up to playing 38 games in a season. \"You must remember that the Premiership is completely different, more pace, better finishing - the lot. In the First Division you can have an off day and still win 3-0. You can't do that in the Prem.\" Pompey's most consistent player, the defender Linvoy Primus, four times their player of the month, says: \"We feel we should be champions because we've led from the start of the season.\" Leicester's striker Paul Dickov does not see it like that, saying: \"We've got five matches left and we can put pressure on Portsmouth for the title. We're unbeaten in 13.\" Mandaric has appealed to Portsmouth supporters not to invade the pitch today. \"If we get the right result every Pompey fan will be entitled to bask in the glory,\" he said. \"But I'm asking everyone to stay off the pitch and respect everyone's enjoyment, including our disabled supporters and small children. This is their party, too. \"We also want a tip-top pitch for another game on Tuesday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
