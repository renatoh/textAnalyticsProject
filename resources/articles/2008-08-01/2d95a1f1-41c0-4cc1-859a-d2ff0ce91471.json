The latest Good Times compilation from Norman Jay MBE (as he insists on styling himself) is yet another cracker. Ella Fitzgerald's cover of the Temptations' Get Ready' sits next to the vintage hip hop of Caveman's 'I'm Ready', and classic R&amp;B and reggae battles it out with cuts from the likes of the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
