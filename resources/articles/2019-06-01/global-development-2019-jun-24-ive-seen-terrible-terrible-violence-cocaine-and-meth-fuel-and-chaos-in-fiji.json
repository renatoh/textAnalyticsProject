He started five years ago, aged 13, selling cigarettes and marijuana. Now he sells cocaine and methamphetamines. \u201cMy family were selling drugs in Suva,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said there would be a time when me and my cousins would take over. We start training, training, training.\u201d Isaiah inhabits Fiji\u2019s underbelly, far removed from the tourist trail of white sand beaches dotted with coconut palms. Here, away from the five-star resorts and snorkelling safaris, police are reckoning with an explosion in the domestic use of what they call \u201cwhite drugs\u201d \u2013 cocaine and methamphetamines \u2013 which until a few years ago were almost unheard of in the country. Law enforcement says increased domestic drug use in Fiji, as well as in other Pacific nations such as Tonga and Samoa, has been fuelled by a combination of factors: growing economies, booming tourist industries and the fact these countries lie on a transnational drug shipping route. This route is used by traffickers who use yachts to bring cocaine and methamphetamines from the US and Latin America to Australia, where drug users pay the highest price a gram (about A$300 or \u00a3180) and have one of the highest rates of per capita cocaine use in the world. For Isaiah, drugs have become a way of life. After his family broke down when he was 10 he spent six years sleeping rough on the streets of the capital, Suva, where he fell in with a gang. Now he is the one doing the training, teaching boys as young as 11 how to deal drugs. \u201cI\u2019m the youngest of the dealers in Fiji, the youngest and the strongest,\u201d he boasts. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about going to jail, I\u2019m not scared of anyone. If you want to threaten me I\u2019ll fuck you up,\u201d he says, in a sort of general threat to the world. He tells the Guardian that he can now make between FJD$5,000 (\u00a31,800) and $10,000 (\u00a33,500) in a day, in a country where the minimum wage is $2.86. Fiji\u2019s national drug advisory council says meth, which is more widespread in the country than cocaine, costs between FJD$700 and $1,000 (\u00a3255-\u00a3365) a gram. \u201cIt\u2019s good money, I\u2019m getting high, having fun,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I have the dope, I can get anything I want.\u201d Across the table, Lisa*, 26, whom Isaiah describes as his surrogate stepmother, says that for her drugs are not about enjoyment, but survival. She explains she takes meth and cocaine to help with health issues, including back pain and panic attacks. Lisa has two children, the youngest of whom is two. She is also a sex worker, an occupation that is illegal in Fiji. \u201cIce helps me so I don\u2019t have sickness; I had panics and back pain,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people say, \u2018Why are you using this?\u2019 I\u2019m using this for my safety and my life; I\u2019m looking after my kids.\u201d \u2018I have nearly been killed\u2019 Sitiveni Qiliho, Fiji\u2019s police commissioner, is in charge of tackling the nation\u2019s growing drug problem, which he says has shifted in recent years. Years ago drug use was confined to well-off parts of the community, he says, but not any more. \u201cFiji\u2019s known as a transit point for moving drugs to Australia and New Zealand \u2026 but we also have local users now,\u201d Qiliho says. Arrests for drug-related crimes in Fiji increased from 685 in 2017 to 1,061 in 2018. There is no data in the country about rates of addiction, but St Giles psychiatric hospital in Suva reported that nearly 20% of its patients in the year from May 2017 to April 2018 were admitted for substance abuse issues, mostly for addiction to methamphetamines. Ian Collingwood [see footnote] knows all about the country\u2019s drug problem. The 49-year-old, who moved to Fiji when he was four, has been using drugs since he was a teenager. He says his own transition from being a recreational user to what he calls a \u201cnarcotics coper\u201d mirrors Fiji\u2019s own relationship with drugs. \u201cIn the time I\u2019ve spent in Fiji I\u2019ve watched this happen,\u201d he tells the Guardian from the verandah of a popular cafe in Nadi. \u201cIn the 1980s and 90s, I knew people who smoked a fair bit of pot but it \u2026 was uncommon and frowned upon. From 2005 onwards there was more and more methamphetamines and ice coming into the country.\u201d \u2018No support\u2019 The impacts of the burgeoning drug scene are visible on the streets of the country\u2019s cities, Collingwood says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen terrible, terrible violence. I\u2019ve seen a guy\u2019s jaw come through his face, holes burnt in someone\u2019s feet with a welding torch, I myself have nearly been killed with hammers and kerosene.\u201d As he talks, a silver car drives by twice, honking its horn. The driver says a drug enforcer who believes Collingwood owes him money is on his way. Collingwood asks to move inside the cafe, out of sight of the street. Asked where drug addicts can go if they want to get clean, Collingwood shrugs. There is no rehab centre in Fiji, no methadone clinic, no addiction health specialists, not even a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. \u201cI went to Australia and I went to rehab in Byron [Bay], which was great, until I came back here,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout any support whatsoever, you just fall over. \u201cThe mindset is still very much that it\u2019s criminal, it\u2019s dealt with criminally, there\u2019s no consideration that it\u2019s a mental health issue yet.\u201d Lisa agrees, saying Fiji is not a good place to be a user. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of judgment,\u201d she says. There are no charities offering rehab in Fiji. The Salvation Army, which until December had a small addiction service, had to close it down when two staff members took jobs in New Zealand. The charity is hoping to open again later in the year and, in the meantime, a Salvation Army youth worker, Amani Waqetia, operates as a one-man drug program. At any time, Waqetia and his wife house up to 15 boys, aged eight to 19, in their small three-bedroom house in Nakasi, a suburb in the north-east of Suva. The boys, most of whom come from troubled homes or who are estranged from their families, are mostly sniffing glue, smoking pot or drinking. Waqetia is under no illusions about what he is able to achieve alone and believes Fiji\u2019s drug problem requires a coordinated, nationwide response. His aim is to keep the children in school and reconnect them with their families so they don\u2019t end up gravitating toward the sorts of gangs that Isaiah joined. \u201cThese are all the outward signs: theft, drugs and all this. Instead of reacting to these problems, we are trying to respond to the need \u2013 that is care, love \u2013 these are things they are missing from their own homes,\u201d he says. Back in Nadi as the night wears on, Isaiah is itching to get to work. Walking out of Burger King he says he is off to \u201cfind people who owe me money and get them to pay me\u201d. When he discovers there is a city-wide blackout and all the street lights are out, he is delighted and runs off into the dark night with a grin. * Names have been changed to protect identities \u2022 Guardian Australia points out that the Ian Collingwood interviewed in this article is not the man also named Ian Collingwood who for many years has worked as an education consultant in East Asia and the Pacific region, including periods living in Fiji and Vanuatu."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
