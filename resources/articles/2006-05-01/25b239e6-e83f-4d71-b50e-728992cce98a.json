But business schools don't give them away. Students can pay anything from \u00a36,000 for a distance-learning MBA to \u00a360,000 for a full-time MBA at a top UK school. Some prospective students receive sponsorship from their employers to study part-time. According to a survey by the Association of MBAs last year, three quarters of employers help with the costs of part-time study. But what if you're quitting a job to do a full-time course or, worse still, coming off the back of an undergraduate or second degree, already in hock to the banks and Student Loans Company? Without any personal savings to fall back on, most students take out fresh loans or remortgage. Some banks, such as NatWest, offer special MBA loans to cover tuition fees, study equipment and course expenses where repayments begin a few months after graduation and can be spread over a period of up to 10 years. Under the NatWest scheme, full-time students can borrow up to two thirds of pre-course gross salary plus tuition fees for each study year. But you will be expected to stump up 20% of the total course fees yourself. Several business schools offer their own loan schemes. London Business School, for example, offers a loan scheme in conjunction with HSBC. Thankfully, there's another option. Most schools offer some kind of scholarship. Typically linked to merit (you're a particularly high achiever) or need (you've shown potential but lack the money to fulfil it), scholarships pay some but rarely all of a course's costs. Some schools use scholarships to attract high achievers who will boost their grade averages. Less glamorous schools hand out big cheques to get more students through their doors. Even the top-ranked schools use scholarships as a lever for improving the diversity of their student body. For example, women now outnumber men on many full-time postgraduate courses, but business schools still struggle to attract applications from women. Around 75% of MBA students at top business schools in the UK are men. Here's a selection of the scholarships currently on offer. But don't dally: many scholarships have lengthy applications procedures and deadlines several months ahead of the MBA application deadline.
