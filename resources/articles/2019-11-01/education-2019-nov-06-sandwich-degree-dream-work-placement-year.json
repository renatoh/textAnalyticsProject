I thought spending a year working in the industry would confirm whether it should be my future career,\u201d she says. \u201cThe application procedure was draining. Eventually I secured my placement in communications at an NHS hospital after endless applications and four interviews. But it was worth it, and I now have a full-time job in marketing.\u201d The sandwich degree \u2013 which incorporates a year working in industry, rather than a BA in baguette-making \u2013 is beloved by students for its employability boost. But, like Hawkins, many find the application process daunting \u2013 especially when looking for a role in an area without many formal sandwich placements. Here recruiters, university careers experts and graduates reveal the best way to secure a dream placement. Start early. Most schemes ask for applications in October of the year before your placement. But Anne Patton, placement officer at the University of East Anglia, says: \u201cSome vacancies are advertised during late summer and autumn. And some of the really large organisations open and close their vacancies before students return to university, so it pays to be ready over the summer.\u201d Don\u2019t leave your application to the last minute. \u201cSome employers close their vacancies once they find the right candidates, so apply as soon as you can,\u201d she adds. Look for opportunities everywhere. Start with your university\u2019s online jobs board as well as portals like Ratemyplacement and Milkround, but make sure you track the more general jobs websites, too, as smaller firms may advertise year-long positions there. Careers fairs are a good place to network and grill employers about any opportunities. Network. If you do meet a potential contact, \u201ctake their business card and make a note of your conversation with them,\u201d advises Abigail Swain, placement officer at the University of Westminster. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget what was talked about if you\u2019ve spoken to so many people in the same day. Send them a personalised email, referencing the conversation you had \u2013 that\u2019s more likely to get a reply.\u201d Look beyond the major firms. Smaller firms and startups tend to offer interns more things to do. But if you focus on a niche industry, or a firm that doesn\u2019t offer formal schemes, you\u2019ll have to do more groundwork, advises Kate Hastings, placements adviser at Newcastle University careers service. \u201cSpeak to your careers service to sound out ideas and have your covering letter checked.\u201d Be personal. Tailor your CV and covering letter for every application. Even though it\u2019s time-consuming, ensuring your application highlights the skills or requirements of a specific company and placement is vital. When you approach a firm about a potential placement try to find a named person, rather than writing to a generic \u201cSir or Madam\u201d. If the company website doesn\u2019t list an HR contact, a phone call or LinkedIn might help. Don\u2019t give up. \u201cLots of students feel demoralised if they haven\u2019t been offered a placement by Christmas and stop looking,\u201d says Hastings. \u201cBut there are still lots of good opportunities to be found at that stage, potentially with smaller organisations who might be able to offer higher responsibility levels and a unique experience. It\u2019s worth persevering.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
