After his tee shot finished on the front edge of the 248-yard par three, the world No1 proceeded to hole a magnificent 100ft putt for birdie, over a ridge. It is no exaggeration to regard the putt as one of the finest in Open history. Miss of the day Colin Montgomerie needed a rousing start to get the Scottish crowds on side. He was afforded a perfect opportunity at the 1st but squirmed a 4\u00bdft birdie putt past on the right edge. Unfortunately for Montgomerie, that set an inauspicious tone as he carded 73. Brit watch The baby-faced 18-year-old amateur Rory McIlroy, from Northern Ireland if not GB, showed experienced professionals how to go about their business with a flawless round of 68. McIlroy, who was only 10 when the Open was held at Carnoustie in 1999, did not drop a shot all day in outperforming the likes of Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh and Ernie Els. Burn watch As the 1999 winner here, Paul Lawrie should really know better but he and his playing partner Justin Rose pitched relatively simple approach shots far too near the front of the 3rd green and watched their balls trickle back into the winding Barry Burn. Group of the day 1.20pm. Retief Goosen, Thomas Bjorn, Justin Leonard. Goosen and Bjorn, regulars on the upper reaches of major leaderboards, are firmly in contention with scores of one under par and both will be looking for a surge. Leonard, a former Open champion, faces a struggle to make the cut after a disappointing opening 74. Carnoustie or Carnasty? A horrendous morning, when rain battered players and only six in the first 12 groups broke par, evoked memories of 1999. But the rain disappeared by lunchtime, with only a breeze into competitors' faces during the closing holes preventing perfect scoring conditions. Several players subsequently dropped shots from the 15th onwards but Ernie Els, who shot a one-over 72, described the course as 'easy'. Today: Weather forecast Cloudy but should stay largely dry. An easterly breeze off the North Sea will mean a repeat of yesterday's chilly feel. Maximum temperature 15C TV and radio TV Live on BBC2 from 9am-7pm.
