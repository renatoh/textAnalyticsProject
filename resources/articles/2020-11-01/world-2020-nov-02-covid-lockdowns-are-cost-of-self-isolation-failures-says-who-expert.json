The WHO does not recommend that countries enter lockdowns. It has consistently said that the key to controlling epidemics, whether Covid-19, Sars or flu, is to test people, trace their contacts and ensure all those who are positive or who have been close to those infected are quarantined. While countries like the UK have been massively increasing the numbers of tests carried out, contact tracing has fallen short, and studies have shown that as few as 20% of people in England fully comply with self-isolation. \u201cFor me, the big missing link in what\u2019s going on in many European countries is management of isolation,\u201d said Dr Margaret Harris of the WHO. \u201cThat\u2019s not just isolation of people who are sick \u2013 it\u2019s isolation of people who have contacts and are first-degree contacts. \u201cThey don\u2019t think they have Covid, because they feel fine, and even if they are told they should stay home, they don\u2019t feel a strong social obligation or they do not necessarily have that reinforced as happens in some countries. \u201cSo for instance, in a place like Hong Kong, you would be called every day, or the police come to your house,\u201d she said. Across Asia, there is a mixture of economies that have managed the virus well \u2013 not just those that may be non-liberal, non-democratic command economies, she added. \u201cTaiwan, for instance, probably has the best management. They are definitely a highly liberal society.\u201d A lockdown which effectively isolates everyone does work, Harris said, \u201cbut it also causes massive dislocation, massive disruption. And unless you\u2019ve worked out how you can possibly put that pause button on and maintain your economic and social lives, the price you pay is very, very high.\u201d The WHO doesn\u2019t say don\u2019t do it, she said. \u201cWe just say, if you\u2019re doing it, you\u2019re paying a very high price, so therefore get some return for what you pay.\u201d That means getting test and trace to work efficiently \u201cand you could think very hard about how to make self-isolation doable\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do it at grassroots level, because it\u2019s very different, say, in London from somewhere rural, it\u2019s different in housing estates, you may have people living on the streets, you may have people living in institutions. So, you have to really know your society, and know how you\u2019re going to make it possible for them to self-isolate. \u201cThere will be people who cannot possibly self-isolate, because they live in crowded conditions or on the streets. You may have to think of offering them somewhere else to stay. \u201cIt does require a lot of planning. It requires a lot of a great deal of partnership with community and with local authorities, and really listening to your mayors and your councils and all the people in your local groups or your NGOs who understand how communities really function and ensure that you\u2019re reaching everyone. \u201cYou might have communities who don\u2019t have access to standard English-language channels and all the rest of it, and don\u2019t really know what is being asked of them or whether it\u2019s possible.\u201d Harris said that some places, such as Hong Kong, isolate those who have Covid-19 by putting them in hospital with even mild symptoms, which means it is far easier and quicker to spot those who deteriorate and treat them, saving lives. Early medical monitoring helped with getting people the right treatment, she added, and although it\u2019s not yet clear, getting earlier care to people could also save some from the after-effects known as long Covid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
