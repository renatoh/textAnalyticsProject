Felicia Kwaku, 52, an associate director of nursing at King\u2019s College NHS foundation trust, said her OBE was for \u201cfallen colleagues\u201d. \u201cWe saw in March and April that nurses and midwives were dying. For many of us that wasn\u2019t acceptable and we knew we needed to respond in a different kind of way,\u201d said Kwaku, who lost an uncle and also a medical colleague, Dr Alfa Saadu, to the virus. \u201cSo the honour honours all of those who laid their lives down on the line and continued to serve \u2026 it\u2019s about my fallen colleagues.\u201d Kwaku, the chair of the chief nursing officer\u2019s black and minority ethnic strategic advisory group, championed the cause of Filipino nurses disproportionately affected by the pandemic. She described harrowing stories from nurses of not having enough PPE, of masks not fitting \u201cAsian features very well\u201d, and of hearing about colleagues becoming very unwell while working. Black and minority ethnic nurses and midwives were particularly scared of getting Covid-19, she said. She helped canvass for better risk assessments to make conditions safer. By the end of May, she had counted 77 nurses and midwives who had died. \u201cBarring three or four,\u201d she said, they were all black or Asian. Jay Flynn, 38, receives an MBE after transferring his weekly pub quiz online and raising more than \u00a3750,000. The money is being split between health charities, with a donation also to the homelessness charity Connection, based at St Martin-in-the-Fields, in London, which saved him when he was a street sleeper a decade ago. The charity\u2019s outreach workers found him on the Victoria Embankment, where he had slept for two years. \u201cMy mental health was on its knees by that point,\u201d said Flynn, a married father who lives in Darwen, Lancashire. \u201cThey rebuilt from the shell I was.\u201d The donation will help with costs the charity has incurred housing street sleepers during the pandemic. \u201cI always said when I could and when the opportunity presented itself to me, I would repay a debt I felt that I owed them,\u201d he said. David Maguire, 62, a Glasgow restaurateur, receives an MBE after providing \u201csignificantly more than 100,000\u201d free meals for hospital workers, vulnerable and isolated people and children missing free school meals during lockdown. He said of his nomination that it was \u201csurreal to think that anyone had noticed what we were doing\u201d. Jolene Miller, 42, a former paramedic turned train driver from Stockton, Co Durham, became a volunteer paramedic caring for critically ill patients while continuing her job with Northern Trains. She arranged with her bosses to work one week on, one week off \u2013 \u201ca week on the NHS and a week on the trains\u201d. She receives a British Empire Medal (BEM). Miller said: \u201cIt was tiring, as it was for everyone who is working on the frontline, and I had that week back on the train to recuperate as well, whereas my colleagues in the NHS didn\u2019t have that week to recuperate.\u201d She added: \u201cThe fact that somebody else has nominated me is a big thing.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 October 2020 to correct the spelling of \u201crestaurateur\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
