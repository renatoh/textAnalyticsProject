The sheriff also said that the interview with the unidentified woman \"puts a whole new light on this story\" but he gave no specifics. A news conference was planned for later in the day to provide more details. \"We do believe at this point ... that we will soon have an admission to the birth of the child,\" Sheriff Jenne said. The boy, believed to be less than an hour old, was thrown out of a car alongside a busy street yesterday afternoon, police said. The 4.19-kg (8lb 2oz boy), whose umbilical cord was still attached, survived with minor injuries and was receiving hospital treatment today. Nurses at the hospital have nicknamed the child Johnny. State law lets a mother leave a baby at any medical facility or fire station within three days of birth without any questions asked. \"That provides parents or women with an option. You don't have to just abandon your child in way that would endanger his or her life,\" said Veda Coleman-Wright, a sheriff's office spokeswoman. A woman stopped and found the baby inside a small plastic bag. She scooped him up and took him to a nearby sheriff's office, and he was transferred to Broward General Medical Center. The woman, who originally thought the couple had thrown a puppy out the window, was \"very distraught, very upset,\" Sheriff Jenne said. The woman's name was not released. Investigators had been searching for a white, older-model large sedan that witnesses observed leaving the scene. The baby's rescuer told investigators she observed a man and woman arguing inside the vehicle. But she saw only the back of their heads, Sheriff Jenne said, and could not provide a good description. North Lauderdale is about 15 miles north-west of Fort Lauderdale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
