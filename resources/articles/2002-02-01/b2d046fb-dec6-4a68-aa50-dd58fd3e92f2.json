He then swivels downwards on his knees as if trying to corkscrew himself through the ice, before throwing his arms wide in a theatrical flourish and flashing the megawatt smile of the professionally happy camper. \"Voil\u00e0,\" he says to the lithe woman skater standing by, watching his turn. \"That's what I mean.\" At nearly 45, and despite keeping several knee surgeons in business over the years, Robin Cousins clearly can still cut it. Indeed, watching him in action, one feels the man who won the Olympic figure skating title in 1980 must keep a portrait of himself in an attic somewhere, doing his ageing for him. Cousins looks no older or less agile than the day he set a million grannies' hearts aflutter with his gold-medal performance in Lake Placid. The one thing, though, that has changed is his bank balance. Back then he barely scraped a crust stacking shelves in a department store. These days he is choreographer in chief of Holiday On Ice, a hugely profitable entertainment institution which, despite registering on the cool scale somewhere between Des O'Connor and Dale Winton, has three shows out on the road at any one time during the winter, filling venues from Germany to Brazil. And, wherever it goes, Cousins is there to check that the pirouettes and pasos dobles run smooth, if necessary by showing his cast how it should be done. \"Because they know you've done it yourself, they know you're not going to ask them to do something that's impossible,\" he says of his performers, a United Nations of skaters from everywhere from Belarus to Bloemfontein. \"Every day, 12, 13, 14 hours a day, I've got my skates on. My skates were never on for that length of time when I was competing.\" This week, though, Cousins' blades are to have a rest. He is off to Salt Lake City to commentate for the BBC on the Winter Olympics figure skating, which starts tomorrow. Though he will have at least half a mind on his day job. \"I'm pretty much on the look-out for skaters all the time,\" he says, his voice still carrying unmistakable traces of Bristol despite a quarter-century in transatlantic showbiz. \"We need at least 150 in the company and you never know who is going to get injured, who is going to go home over Christmas and not come back. \"Salt Lake could be a very good recruiting ground. There will be people who have been hanging on for the Olympics who are now perhaps ready for a new direction.\" Sadly, none of them will be British. Cousins was the middle prong of a treble of British success at the Winter Olympics. In 1976 John Curry took gold in the men's figure skating, in 1980 Cousins followed him and in 1984 Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, in the ice dancing, notched up a straight run of perfect scores with their passionate interpretation of Ravel's Bolero, an event so etched in the nation's consciousness that 17 years on it was voted among our 10 favourite sporting moments. This time round no one has qualified for the singles events and the pair are really there only for the experience. For nearly a decade Britain ruled the ice, yet since Cousins' era the country has not had one serious contender. As a decline, figure skating's collapse is probably the most vertiginous in British sport. \"Does it depress me?\" says Cousins. \"It depresses me being asked what's gone wrong and people expecting me to have the answer.\" Well, maybe not the answer but as an active participant still on the scene - he has just choreographed his nephew Tristan Cousins to a national junior championship - can he analyse what is happening in British competition skating? \"I have to say I went to the national championships this year and it was a depressing experience, a genuinely depressing experience,\" he says. \"Not that the kids weren't trying; they were. Even though they were falling five or six times they did not give up. \"They all went out there with the intention of succeeding. But it just didn't happen. Right now our seniors are at junior level, our juniors are at novice level and something has to be done to bring that standard up.\" Though just what he is not sure. There are no fewer rinks than in his day, no shortage of coaches and, he says, the will to improve appears to be in place. \"One thing you cannot accuse the skating authorities of is complacency,\" he says. \"How or why we are no longer competing, that's the question. Maybe it's because our coaches are self-employed and to have a kid in competition means they lose a week's money, so there's a mind-set that it's better not to encourage their kids too far. I don't know. All I do know is the association is aware of the problem and is working on it.\" In what way? \"Well, they've got me involved in a programme to encourage the grassroots - though that's probably not the best term for ice skating.\" Cousins reckons ultimately it is more a problem of philosophy: skating is merely the most extreme case study of the British attitude to sport in general. \"You know, in the old Soviet Union you either did sport properly or not at all,\" he says. \"We are a society which values sport as a recreation. Just look at what we call things: we don't have sports academies, we have leisure centres. For me, that's a good thing. It's more important that there are more people trying ice skating than it is to have one Olympic champion.\" Yet surely the one feeds off the other? When Steve Redgrave won his fifth gold medal, the British Rowing Association unashamedly used his success as a recruit ing sergeant. Most administrators say role models are crucial, yet British skating appeared to throw away the opportunity presented by four of the best. \"But you see, I'm not sure about how valuable role models are,\" he says. \"If you say you want to be Torvill and Dean and someone says to you, OK, get out on the ice at 3.30 in the morning on a freezing January day and you say, no thank you, then you won't make it. There has to be a passion there that goes beyond personalities. \"You find out how badly you want something, getting up at four in the morning to practise for two hours on [London's] Queensway ice rink before the public session, then going to stack shelves at Whiteleys, living in a \u00a39-a-week bedsit in Notting Hill, with a Bunsen burner instead of a stove, scraping the train fare back to Bristol at the weekend. Maybe with proper funding it shouldn't have to be at that level now but at least doing it like that told me it was something I wanted to do.\" So what was it that drove him through such inconveniences back then? If not a role model, then was it the thought of standing atop the Olympic podium? \"It was performing,\" he says. \"I never skated because I wanted to go to the Olympics. All of a sudden it was, oh, regional championships, then, oh, British championships. Once you get to that level, I admit, you then start to think of what might be next. \"But I was never much of a competitor. Jayne and Chris were, they loved it. I didn't like to watch my rivals perform, I didn't like to hear their marks; I was always influenced about what I'd heard. I'd think: 'Oh, I can't go out and beat that.'\" For him, he says, it was the creative possibilities in the discipline that inspired - and in turn made him a champion. \"I played to the crowd. And my coach encouraged that. He always used to say, win the audience over because, if they love you, the judges might think they've missed something.\" Which was why, when Holiday On Ice invited him to join their travelling circus immediately after he had won his gold medal, he jumped at the chance. It was not so much that at last he could earn a decent living from his skills, it was that here was the opportunity to perform with not a judge or rival in sight. \"I immediately discovered that the only thing competition skating and entertainment skating have in common is the surface,\" he says. \"Suddenly I was going from 12 performances a year to 12 a week. At first I was terrified, because I was going out there and giving people what I thought they wanted, which was a full-on Olympic performance. It took me a while to realise you can't skate at that intensity and not suffer.\" Physically or mentally? \"Both. I was exhausted. Then I gradually began to realise I could give another level of performance that was just as satisfactory, but I could do it every time.\" So does that mean the quality of the skating on display in his shows can never match what is seen at the Olympics? \"Not necessarily,\" he says. \"I have boys and girls who have been top-level international competitors in the company. And for some of them they skate much better without the pressure of competition. If you make a mistake at the Olympics, that's four years' work down the drain. If you make a mistake in Holiday On Ice, there's another performance tomorrow. That can be a tremendously liberating experience.\" Unlike, presumably, this week, when he will be watching the rest of the world park its skates on what used to be Britain's own ice. \"Oh, I don't know,\" he says of the Salt Lake competition. \"I intend to enjoy it. And you never know, I might come back with a new leading man.\" And for Robin Cousins, choreographer supreme, that would be a gold-medal result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
