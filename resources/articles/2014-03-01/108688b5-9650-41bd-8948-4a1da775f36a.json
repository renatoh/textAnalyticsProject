Fmd savings peaked at $3.72bn in June last year for the farming industry, with a total production value of $48.7bn in 2010-11. Queensland is suffering the largest ever recorded area in drought, representing 79% of that state. Total deposits in Queensland as of February this year amount to $689m in savings across 8,177 FMD accounts, amounting to an average of $84,266 per account. There were 24,726 farms in Queensland in 2010 and 120,000 agriculture businesses across the country. In NSW, the state government is providing drought assistance to about one third of the state, although that state does not release drought maps following the end of the federal government\u2019s exceptional circumstances scheme. FMDs allow eligible farmers to set aside up to $400,000 in pre-tax income from primary production so they can draw on the savings in years of low income when extra income bolsters seasonal conditions like drought. The money has to be held on deposit for at least 12 months. Income deposited into an FMD account is tax deductible in the year the deposit is made. It becomes taxable income in the year in which it is withdrawn. Under changes made in its drought package, the government will extend the off-farm annual income threshold test from $65,000 to $100,000 after July 1 and relax the guidelines around consolidating FMD accounts. Other elements of the $320m February drought package include a relaxation of the Farm Household Allowance net farm assets test from $1.5m to $2.55m; $280m in concessional loans at a variable interest rate of 4% to restructure debt; $12m for water-related infrastructure; $10m for pest management; and $10.7m for mental health services. FMDs are held by banks and other eligible institutions, and since the scheme was implemented in 1999, the amount of funds held has increased from $228m to $3.21bn. Drought has not been classified as a natural disaster since 1989 by agreement between federal, state and territory governments. Governments decided drought was just \u201cone of several sources of uncertainty\u201d affecting farm businesses and should be planned for as part of the normal operating environment. Primary producers are not prohibited from withdrawing all or part of their FMD within 12 months of deposit but they do not receive the tax deduction for early withdrawal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
