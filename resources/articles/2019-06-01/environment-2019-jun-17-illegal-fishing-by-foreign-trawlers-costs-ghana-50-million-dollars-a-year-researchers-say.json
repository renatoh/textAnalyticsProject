An investigation published on Monday by the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) claims that \u201csaiko\u201d fishing, whereby trawlers target the staple catch of Ghanaian canoe fishers and sell it back to fishing communities at a profit, landed approximately 100,000 tonnes of fish in 2017, worth $50m (\u00a340m) when sold at sea and up to $81m when sold at port. The practice is precipitating the collapse of Ghana\u2019s staple fish stock \u2013 small pelagic fish such as sardinella, a crucial protein in the local diet. Scientists have warned that stocks could be completely destroyed as early as 2020, said EJF\u2019s executive director, Steve Trent. \u201cThis is corporate, organised crime,\u201d said Trent. \u201cSaiko is facilitated precisely to operate undercover. If you have trawlers coming into port and landing fish they\u2019re not licensed to catch, government agencies have no option but to act. But by using fewer, smaller boats to bring the frozen fish to shore, the catch is claimed as being legitimate and legal when it patently isn\u2019t.\u201d More than 90% of Ghana\u2019s industrial trawl fleet is linked to Chinese owners, who depend on Ghanaian \u201cfront\u201d companies to bypass national laws forbidding their operation, according to the EJF. To gauge the scale of saiko catches, the UK-based charity filmed illegal trans-shipments as they took place at sea and monitored port landings. In 2017, 76 industrial trawlers caught the same amount of fish as 12,000 artisanal canoes, according to the EJF. In addition to licensed catches, the trawlers use illegal nets to catch fish closer to the coast that are normally reserved for artisanal fishers, the organisation said. They transship this catch at night on to specially-made \u201csaiko\u201d canoes, a single one of which can land as much fish as 450 artisanal canoes, the report\u2019s authors estimated. Just 40% of all the trawler catches in 2017 were landed legally, the report claimed, making the remainder illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Saiko was originally a means for trawlers to sell back unwanted by-catch as they trawled for larger species, such as octopus and squid, for overseas export. But the trawlers now intentionally target fish to sell back to fishing communities because of the profit they earn, said Kofi Agbogah, director of the Ghana-based NGO Hen Mpoano, which co-authored the report. \u201cThe incomes of small-scale fishers have dropped by as much as 40% in the past 10-15 years, and Ghana is now forced to import more than half of fish consumed,\u201d said Agbogah. \u201cTranshipments of fish at sea are notoriously difficult to monitor, even with the most advanced systems in place. Instead, all catches should be landed in authorised ports and recorded in official statistics. This would also ensure compliance with fishing-gear restrictions that prevent trawlers from targeting small pelagics.\u201d Since artisanal fishing offers employment to more than 100,000 fishers across hundreds of coastal villages, saiko is also severely impacting local jobs, the report claims, consolidating power in the hands of the few. Based on 100,000 metric tonnes of fish caught, saiko provides only 1.5 jobs, 40 times less than artisanal fishing, the EJF claims. With the majority of the saiko catch consisting of juvenile fish, the report warned that Ghana\u2019s fish populations will face difficulty replenishing themselves. China is now Ghana\u2019s top trade partner (bilateral trade was worth an estimated \u00a36.7b in 2017) as well as its primary source of investment: China recently pledged nearly \u00a320bn in an \u201cagricultural and industrial transformation\u201d of the African country. China\u2019s distant-water fishing fleet is the largest in the world and operates more vessels in west African waters than any other nation. But operations are notoriously below board. Roughly two-thirds of the Chinese vessels fishing in west African waters are fishing illegally, costing billions of dollars in lost revenue and rapidly depleting fish stocks. China was recently ranked as the worst offender for IUU fishing in a global index of 152 countries, yet Beijing continues to provide subsidies and licenses to its distant-water fleet. Observers have questioned how the Chinese vessels are able to operate with apparent impunity when the effects are so devastating to Ghana\u2019s fisheries and population. \u201cThere is a general perception that public officials [in Ghana] are neck-deep or complicit in illegal operations of some [of the] industrial fishing vessels,\u201d said Kwame Adu Agyekum, Ghanaian fisheries officer for the EU-supported Global Monitoring and Security \u2013 Africa project, which monitors coastal vulnerability and fishing traffic. \u201cThe challenge with our inability to reduce or prevent pirate fishing has a lot to do with inadequate human capacity and the weak institutions that are mandated to enforce laws.\u201d As local fishermen attempt to catch what\u2019s left behind, they too turn to illegal methods, the EJF claims, with the use of lights, dynamite and poisonous chemicals increasing exponentially and causing further environmental destruction. \u201cThis does not protect the sea,\u201d said Nana Kweku Ansa, chief fisherman of Gomoa Mankoadze. \u201cBut if that\u2019s the reason why we should stop these practices, then the government must send the Chinese home. The sea belongs to us. So why do we allow them to destroy it like that?\u201d Failure to act by the Ghanaian authorities could spell imminent disaster, said Trent. \u201cWe\u2019re rapidly reaching a situation where people will be forced to migrate because of a lack of local economic and food alternatives. It\u2019s tragic and totally unnecessary.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
