Paul Greengrass", "bodyText": "Job: writer, director Age: 52 Industry: film New entry A former producer and director on ITV's World in Action, Paul Greengrass has become one of the world's most influential directors. United 93, The Bourne Supremacy and sequel The Bourne Ultimatum secured his status on the Hollywood A-list. Greengrass made his name with his acclaimed TV dramatisations Omagh, The Murder of Stephen Lawrence and Bloody Sunday. Then Hollywood came calling. \"He has come out of the TV business and is now as successful a director as anyone in the world right now,\" said our panel. \"He is extremely articulate and a very influential guy.\" He certainly is, named the 28th smartest person in Hollywood by US magazine Entertainment Weekly and the first president of a new industry organisation, Directors UK. It is aiming to be the British equivalent of the Directors Guild of America, the negotiating body securing rights, pay deals and working conditions for directors. After nearly a decade on World In Action, Greengrass was thrust into the limelight in 1987 as co-author of Spycatcher, the controversial memoirs of former MI5 assistant director Peter Wright. He later directed a string of films and TV shows, including Kavanagh QC, but it was when he moved into docudrama, with his ultra-realistic style of film-making rooted in his TV documentary background, that the plaudits began to flow. \"If there's a thread running through my career it's World in Action - the phrase as well as the programme,\" Greengrass told the Guardian. \"One of the things about the Bourne films I have always loved is that, although they're mainstream commercial Saturday night popcorn movies, there's something about the story and character that enables you to get to the paranoia that drives the world today and express it in mainstream way.\" His Bourne films reinvented the mainstream Hollywood thriller and he is slated to direct a fourth in 2010. His next film, which reunites him with Bourne star Matt Damon, is an adaptation of Imperial Life in the Emerald City, the story of life inside Baghdad's Green Zone by Washington Post journalist Rajiv Chandrasekaran. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.
