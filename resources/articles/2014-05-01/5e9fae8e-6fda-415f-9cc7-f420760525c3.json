Doubt over whether Patrick Kluivert, one of Van Gaal's assistants as Holland manager, will join the 62-year-old at Old Trafford offers Giggs the opportunity to be, in effect, the No2 on the new management team. Although Kluivert has never had this role when working with Van Gaal \u2013 Danny Blind occupies it for the Netherlands \u2013 the former Barcelona striker was thought to be in the running to do so at United. Yet Van Gaal has now decided he wants Giggs. While the Dutchman's appointment continues to be expected this week, the Welshman had been minded to turn down any role offered on Van Gaal's staff if it was a junior or token one. However Giggs appears likely to accept what will be a high-ranking position. If Giggs does accept, it will ensure his long association with United \u2013 he is in a 23rd season in the first-team squad \u2013 continues next term, even if the 40-year-old does not play on. Giggs is set to select himself in United's squad for Tuesday evening's visit of Hull City in what could be a last chance to play at Old Trafford and say farewell. As the most decorated player in United's history and a firm favourite he and the supporters would want the opportunity to have a fitting on-field farewell, in case this does prove his final campaign. Giggs has scored in every season since the Premier League began in 1992 except the current one, though this is not a priority. He said: \"I want to do what's best to win the game and not just make room for me in the starting line-up or on the bench, which I won't do. \"Of course, the perfect scenario is me coming on and scoring a goal, the winning goal, and hopefully everyone will be happy but it doesn't always work like that. We'll have towait and see what happens on the night.\" Hull's visit is definitely Nemanja Vidic's Old Trafford swansong, while it could also prove the same for Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra, whose respective careers at United may also end on Sunday. Vidic departs for Internazionale after eight years in which he won five Premier League crowns, the Champions League and three League Cups. He said: \"I have great memories. To win five titles and the Champions League, I couldn't dream of winning that many titles and of playing with so many great players. I have learned a lot, not just on the pitch but off the pitch as well.\" Vidic, who joined from Spartak Moscow in a \u00a37m transfer in January 2006, was the final captain Sir Alex Ferguson appointed. \"I have been playing for the greatest manager ever, I believe,\" he said. \"It was a great experience and this is going to be the best part of my career, these years with United. \"Manchester United make you feel part of the family. I have developed as a man at this club, it has been a great experience for me and my family. I have nothing to regret, I have given 100 per cent.\" The 2008 European Cup final penalty- shoot-out win over Chelsea at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium was Vidic's highlight. \"You don't win the Champions League every year,\" he said. \"The club has won it three times and I was lucky to be part of a team who won it once. And we won it in Moscow, where I played for Spartak for one and a half years. I came back to the stadium to lift the trophy and that's the greatest memory I have.\" Giggs said of Vidic: \"Its always the same when great players leave the club. The club carries on but it's always difficult when they do leave because they give such service and you do need to replace these sort of players. Not like for like sometimes but obviously with quality.\" Evra, who arrived from Monaco for \u00a35.5m at the same time as Vidic, said: \"I am really sad because when you speak about Nemanja it's like you are speaking about myself because we joined the club together. I remember our first game it was so hard \u2013 we played in the reserves. We were so poor and Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, the manager, took us both out. \"We were talking together in the dressing room and saying: 'Oh my god, why have we come to Manchester United? We should go quickly back to our clubs.' It was a difficult moment but we stuck together. We have [stayed] in the same hotel, we go into training together, we win the same trophies.\" Evra, like Vidic, may move to Italian football, though he could yet stay. Ferdinand has stated he would continue at United if he was offered a new deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
