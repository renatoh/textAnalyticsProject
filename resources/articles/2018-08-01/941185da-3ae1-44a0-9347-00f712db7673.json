Kouyat\u00e9, the Senegal midfielder, passed his medical on Wednesday after agreeing personal terms on a four-year contract and moves across London for a fee of \u00a39.5m plus \u00a31.5m in add-ons. The 28-year-old spent four seasons in east London after joining from Anderlecht in 2014 and will provide competition in midfield after the departure of Yohan Cabaye and the Chelsea loanee Ruben Loftus-Cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so happy. It\u2019s been a long day but now everything is good and I\u2019m very excited to start with my new teammates,\u201d Kouyat\u00e9 told Palace TV. \u201cThis is the right time to move because I needed a new challenge. I have good memories of West Ham but I need to come here and give my best because I like the Crystal Palace project. \u201cI spoke to the manager and I know he\u2019ll be a good manager. I also spoke to Pape Souar\u00e9 yesterday and he told me I had to come and now I\u2019m here and I\u2019m very happy.\u201d The arrival of the free agent Max Meyer is also imminent, with Palace waiting for international clearance from Fifa for the 22-year-old Germany midfielder. The Swansea forward Ayew, meanwhile, has also been scheduled for a medical after Palace agreed a deal that will involve the former Ajax midfielder Ja\u00efro Riedewald moving to south Wales permanently. The Ghana international spent 18 months at Swansea after signing from Aston Villa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
