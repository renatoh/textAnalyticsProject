The editor of The Spectator magazine and Daily Telegraph columnist has long been touted for high office, by his friends at least. Mr Johnson has managed to live down being named by former No 10 communications director Alastair Campbell as one of his favourite journalists and, in fact, has a reputation among fellow reporters as one of the most assiduous of their number to cover the Brussels beat. In recent years he has cultivated the image of a rightwing buffoon when presenting the satirical TV quiz Have I got News For You, and appearing as a chat show guest on other entertainment programmes. There is no doubting, however, his campaigning zeal for the Conservatives and he also hit the headlines when, as editor of the Spectator, he decided to publish an article alleging that Tony Blair's office had sought to achieve a greater role for the premier in the funeral service for the Queen Mother. Mr Johnson's dishevelled haircut has made him an easy figure of fun at Westminster, but the MP for Henley has made no secret of the fact that as the inheritor of Michael Heseltine's safe seat he intends to take politics as seriously as anybody. He has even been touted by some as a future leader, but Mr Johnson himself would be the first to tell such soothsayers to keep their feet firmly on the ground. There is no doubt, however, that on the Conservative local associations' \"rubber chicken\" circuit he will be an instant hit, as the apparently bumbling but intuitively incisive guest at the gala dinner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
