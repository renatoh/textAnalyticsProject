In a speech at George Washington University on Wednesday, the Democratic party presidential contender for 2020 will outline a distinctly American brand of socialism as he forcefully rebuts attacks on democratic socialism from the president and other senior Republicans. \u201cWhile President Trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism, they don\u2019t really oppose all forms of socialism,\u201d Sanders will say, according to excerpts of his speech distributed on Tuesday by his campaign. \u201cThey may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people, but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches Trump and other billionaires.\u201d Sanders will describe democratic socialism as a reflection of deeply held American values like fairness and equality as he calls for a reimagining of the US economy. \u201cOver 80 years ago, Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped create a government that made huge progress in protecting the needs of working families,\u201d he will say. \u201cToday in the second decade of the 21st century we must take up the unfinished business of the New Deal and carry it to completion. This is the unfinished business of the Democratic party and the vision we must accomplish.\u201d Since Sanders ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, public perception of democratic socialism has shifted remarkably. The Vermont senator, an independent who registered as a Democrat to run for president, is no longer the only member of Congress to embrace the label; membership to the group Democratic Socialists of America has soared; a majority of House Democrats support universal healthcare; and at least one survey found that more young people prefer socialism to capitalism. But as the ideology becomes more popular, it has invited more attacks from the right. During his State of the Union address this year, Trump vowed that the US will \u201cnever be a socialist country\u201d. Sanders, seated in the audience, remained stone-faced. His philosophy has also faced pushback from his own party. At a recent party event in California, presidential candidate John Hickenlooper was booed by party activists when he declared: \u201cIf we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer.\u201d Hickenlooper was joined by rival John Delaney, who dismissed \u201cslogans posing as policies\u201d. \u201cMedicare for All may sound good. But it\u2019s actually not good policy, nor is it good politics,\u201d he added. Sanders trails Joe Biden in many early primary polls but recent surveys show him beating Trump by similar margins in hypothetical head-to-heads. Part of Sanders\u2019 success in the primary depends on persuading Democrats that he is the strongest candidate to take on Trump. He has repeatedly argued that Trump\u2019s election proved voters are hungry for big ideas \u2013 and that the nominee should be a movement builder who can energize the electorate with a progressive vision. At the California event, Sanders denounced \u201cmiddle ground\u201d policies in a thinly veiled swipe at Biden, a more moderate Democrat who largely rejects Sanders\u2019 brand of politics. \u201cWe cannot go back to the old ways,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have got to go forward with a new and progressive agenda.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
