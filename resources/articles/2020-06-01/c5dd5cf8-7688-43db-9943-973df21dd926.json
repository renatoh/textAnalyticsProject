Crowds descended on a church in Houston, Texas, after Floyd\u2019s body was returned to his childhood hometown to be laid to rest in a cemetery in suburban Pearland next to his mother, whom he called out for as he lay dying with a police officer\u2019s knee on his neck in May. \u201cThird Ward, Cuney Homes, that\u2019s where he was born at,\u201d Floyd\u2019s brother Rodney told mourners at the Fountain of Praise church, on the sixth day of mourning for Floyd in three cities. \u201cBut everybody is going to remember him around the world. He is going to change the world.\u201d Radio stations observed moments of silence. City officials paid tribute on social media. In New York, traders at the stock exchange paused for eight minutes and 46 seconds to mark the length of time the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was filmed kneeling on Floyd, impervious to the man\u2019s pleas for breath and mercy. Since he was killed on 25 May, millions around the world have watched video footage of Floyd\u2019s death taken by a witness on the sidewalk and listened to the 46-year-old struggling to say \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. Brooke Williams, Floyd\u2019s niece, delivered an emotional tribute describing her uncle as \u201cspiritually grounded, an activist\u201d who \u201cmoved people with his words\u201d. \u201cMy name is Brooke Williams, George Floyd\u2019s niece, and I can breathe,\u201d she began. \u201c[As] long as I\u2019m breathing, justice will be served.\u201d \u201cLives like George will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives,\u201d said the civil rights advocate the Rev Al Sharpton in his eulogy. Celebrating the passion of the mass protests, he added: \u201cAll over the world I\u2019ve seen grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave master statues.\u201d Outside the church, dozens gathered to honor their fellow Houstonian, wearing shirts reading \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d. \u201cThe way his life was taken, he wasn\u2019t able to go through due process,\u201d said Savant Moore, 35. \u201cWe have to stand together to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney representing Floyd\u2019s family, had earlier led a press conference with families of other victims of violent policing: Pamela Turner in Texas, Trayvon Martin in Florida, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Eric Garner in New York, Botham Jean in Texas, and Michael Brown in Missouri: a few representing many more. \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s life mattered, and black lives matter,\u201d Crump said. Protesters have claimed some victories \u2013 charges for all four now former officers at the scene of Floyd\u2019s killing, and a high bail for Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on his neck. The case is seen by many as the tipping point for an unjust system waiting to be tipped. Alongside Floyd\u2019s name, demonstrators in cities across the country shouted the names of their own who had been killed by law enforcement officers, the overwhelming majority of whom kept their jobs and never faced criminal charges. The officers who shot and killed 26-year-old Breonna Taylor as she slept in her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment in March have not been charged. The weeks of unrest devolved into instances of looting and destruction on the fringes that prompted some jurisdictions to impose unprecedented curfews and call in the national guard for support. But the protesters coast to coast have been mostly peaceful. Like Floyd\u2019s killing, instances of use of force by police at these protests were captured on video. Officers filmed assaulting protesters were charged. Calls to defund police departments have led to some action by local leaders around the country, a change from recent history. In Minneapolis, the city council secured a veto-proof majority in favor of dismantling the entire troubled police force. Among the line of buses and cars at the front of the church, Savant Moore shared a sentiment he posted on Facebook in the aftermath of the killing: \u201cIt really took a global pandemic with no sports, no concerts, no vacations to get the world to sit down and have no choice but to watch what\u2019s really happening to black people in America with zero distractions.\u201d Moore was an army ranger who had been deployed four times, once in Afghanistan and another time in Iraq. But he said it was here in his home country that he was scared. \u201cI have a college degree from Howard University. I\u2019m an entrepreneur. And this is my America. Every day, I still have to worry about whether people will not like me because of the color of my skin, or if I might not make it back home to my children because I encounter a police officer for a routine traffic stop.\u201d Joe Biden, Donald Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent in November\u2019s election, visited Floyd\u2019s family on Monday and delivered a remote message at the funeral, calling for change. \u201cToday, now, is the time, the purpose, the season to listen and heal,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNow is the time for racial justice. That\u2019s the answer we must give to our children when they ask why. Because when there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s funeral service was for family and friends only, but Tamecia Dogbe, 41, still drove two and a half hours from Austin with her sister and 12-year-old niece to stand outside the church in the sweltering heat and humidity. \u201cIt feels like a part of history, something I want my niece to witness,\u201d she said. \u201cTen years from now, she might be able to see this in a history book.\u201d She can only pray that in 10 years, these sort of funerals \u2013 services for victims of police killings \u2013 will be a thing of the past as well. Floyd\u2019s golden casket was taken by horse-drawn carriage to the cemetery, where he was interred next to his mother. Officials shut down the roads from the church to the cemetery, including a section of major toll road, to make way for the procession. Along the route, groups of supporters waved \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs and cheered for Floyd. About a mile from the cemetery entrance, hundreds lined the streets, holding up umbrellas and makeshift tents to protect themselves from the unrelenting sun. They doodled chalk messages of \u201crest in power\u201d and \u201cbe the change\u201d along the sidewalk, and periodically broke out in chants: \u201cSay his name! George Floyd!\u201d Herman Bell, 37, was on his way with his family to the eye doctor when he decided to stop to watch the procession. \u201cWe lost a great man from the Third Ward,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI want my kids to understand that when they go to school, they need to go to school and better themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThis man went out and bettered the world.\u201d There was a sense in Houston that in times like these, people come out to support the family even if they didn\u2019t know them. Schon Carter, 40, came out on Tuesday to show not just her support for the family, but to show that \u201cwe\u2019re all standing in one accord\u201d. \u201cIt feels good that despite the heat, the weather, that people actually took the time out to show their respect for the family,\u201d Carter said. The last few weeks have been \u201cmind-opening\u201d for her, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect for the future, but it\u2019s definitely time for a change.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
