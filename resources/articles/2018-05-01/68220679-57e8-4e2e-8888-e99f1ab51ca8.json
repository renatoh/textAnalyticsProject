Ferguson had been in Salford hospital since Saturday following an emergency operation but a statement from the club on Wednesday evening revealed that he is making progress in his recovery. \u201cSir Alex no longer needs intensive care and will continue rehabilitation as an inpatient,\u201d it read. \u201cHis family have been overwhelmed by the level of support and good wishes but continue to request privacy as this will be vital during this next stage of recovery.\u201d On hearing the positive update, the Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger sent his best wishes to his former rival. He said: \u201cIt is very fantastic news and I\u2019m very happy for that. It was a concern because he has worked very hard and he deserves a long period of enjoying life, and hopefully he can do that in good shape.\u201d Earlier, the United manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho admitted that the club were \u201cvery, very positive\u201d that Ferguson would recover. \u201cWe are confident,\u201d he said. The manager does not believe there is a cloud over the club and described the spirits of players and staff as good. \u201cWe are very, very positive.\u201d After Ferguson collapsed at the family home on Saturday, he was taken to Macclesfield district hospital at around 9am, before receiving a police escort to rush him to the Salford facility, where he was operated on. That day, the club issued the following statement: \u201cSir Alex Ferguson has undergone emergency surgery today for a brain haemorrhage. The procedure has gone very well but he needs a period of intensive care to optimise his recovery. His family request privacy in this matter.\u201d United play at West Ham on Thursday evening and when asked how Ferguson\u2019s condition might affect the display, Mourinho said: \u201cI can only think that if there is any relation, it is a positive relation.\u201d Romelu Lukaku will miss the game and is in a race to be fit for the FA Cup final against Chelsea on Saturday week. \u201cThat\u2019s what we try,\u201d said Mourinho, who added that Marouane Fellaini has a chance of playing in their final Premier League game, at home to Watford on Sunday. United need a point at West Ham to secure second place, their highest finish since winning the title five years ago. Yet the manager admits he has players who may never be mentally strong enough. \u201cI trust some more than others that can bridge that gap,\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cThat\u2019s normal. I know the players. I worked with the players for a couple of years. And, of course, some of the players I am totally convinced are going to make it, some others I have good hopes that they are going to make it, and some others I don\u2019t believe they are going to make it. \u201cOf course we can keep [those not up to it]. Unless there is a perfect squad, where you buy one goalkeeper, you don\u2019t like [him], you buy another one, or you buy a central defender, you don\u2019t like, you buy another one, you have to keep players you don\u2019t love \u2013 when I say love, I say it \u2018footballistically\u2019 \u2013 and players you don\u2019t totally believe have the level of the squad.\u201d United have beaten all the other top-six teams this season but managed to lose at Newcastle, Huddersfield and Brighton. \u201cWhen you lose against all the teams that were promoted, that doesn\u2019t smell right for me,\u201d Mourinho said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
