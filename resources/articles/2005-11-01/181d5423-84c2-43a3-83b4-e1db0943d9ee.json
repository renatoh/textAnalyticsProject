Luis Garc\u00eda has lived with the fierce criticism that has dogged the European champions for much of the current campaign. \"But it doesn't annoy me,\" he said. \"I can understand it.\" Anderlecht visit Anfield tonight having lost their last 10 matches in this competition and with Liverpool content to be back in European mode. Garc\u00eda is synonymous with this club's different form in the two competitions. Since his \u00a36m transfer from Barcelona he boasts seven goals in 21 continental appearances, with only nine in 42 domestic matches. \"In the Champions League opponents know that one goal can see you go through to the next round,\" he said. \"So teams are more attack-minded and you get much more space. \"Rafa [Ben\u00edtez] understands. In his career he has been in this kind of position with people questioning his team. He is stronger for that. He puts up a big barrier to deflect that criticism because he knows what to do to improve the team. \"We have a stronger side than last season but it is still different to the rest of the teams in England who use four strong defenders and then two strong midfielders. We have different qualities.\" Garc\u00eda, too, is learning. Since his days as a winger under Ben\u00edtez at Tenerife, the manager has attempted to hammer home where and when his playmaker should attempt the audacious tricks and flicks upon which his game thrives. At times this season, as last, Garc\u00eda has infuriated those on the Kop - and his centre-half Jamie Carragher - by attempting the lavish too close to his own goal. \"When I tried a back-heel not in a good position, I'd hear Carra shouting,\" admitted Garc\u00eda. \"I'm just too confident in my ability sometimes. But every player has to offer something to the team and that is what I bring to the table, creativity. Maybe one of these tricks can finish in a goal.\" Liverpool know victory tonight, coupled with a Chelsea win in Seville, would secure their passage into the knock-out phase with two games to play, Ben\u00edtez said: \"It would be great to have two games without pressure. Then you can use the squad and maybe try different players in different positions and we can also prepare for the Premier League games with more time.\" Given their start, that time would be well spent on the domestic development."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
