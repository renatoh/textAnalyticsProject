The attendance of 20,318 smashed the previous Irish home best of 18,585 and came very close to the Premiership record of 20,793 that saw Bristol play Bath at the end of last season. It also put into the shade the 14,486 who were present to watch Reading on Boxing Day here and such was the congestion on the M4 that Wasps found themselves stuck in traffic and the kick-off had to be put back by 30 minutes. The fact that the Webb Ellis Cup was being paraded at half-time was an added attraction and England's success has clearly created a real enthusiasm for club rugby. Enthusiasm that will have been kindled further by a full-blooded encounter, which produced five tries and a seventh straight win in all competitions for Wasps. They may have been tardy, but Wasps made an explosive start. A fine run down the left by Tom Voyce seemed to have come to nothing when possession was lost. But when Irish fed the ball back, it was dropped by lock Bob Casey and his opposite number, Richard Birkett, had only to pick up the ball and run 10 metres to score under the posts. Alex King converted and Wasps led by seven points after just two minutes. London Irish had an immediate chance to reduce the deficit, but blood replacement Matt Cannon was just wide with a penalty. By the time Wasps next infringed, in the 12th minute, regular place-kicker Mark Mapletoft was back on the field, but he was no more successful, pulling a none-too-difficult chance well wide. In contrast, King made no mistake when he was offered another chance after Irish full-back Michael Horak had chased a Mapletoft chip from a marginally offside position. There was little to choose between the sides in terms of possession as the match moved into its second quarter, but the visitors always looked more dangerous. So it was no surprise when a superb break by Paul Volley created the chance for Voyce to cross for the second try, with King again converting. Wasps looked like taking the 17-point advantage into half-time, but their forwards offended at a ruck and Mapletoft kicked a far more difficult penalty than the one he had missed. Suitably encouraged, Irish mounted a sustained attack at the start of the second half and were rewarded when Mapletoft slotted a second penalty. Suddenly the outside-half had found his range and, when Wasps failed to release, he landed a third penalty from near the halfway line. Clearly inspired, the Irish thwarted a series of Wasps attacks and with 18 minutes remaining they moved to within one score when Mapletoft dropped a goal. But Wasps breathed rather more easily when King kicked his second penalty four minutes later and they made the game safe with six minutes to go, with the third try of the match. After Josh Lewsey had nearly scored in the right corner, Irish did well to stop a series of close-range assaults. They had, though, committed all their men and when Wasps moved the ball wide full-back Mark van Gisbergen had an unopposed run to the line. King once again converted but the Irish were still not finished. A try by Horak, which Mapletoft converted, ensured a rousing finish and an instant response by Wasps. Replacement Ayoola Erinle bullocked his way over, with King yet again converting. London Irish coach Gary Gold, while praising his own side's 'unbelievable spirit', described Wasps as 'the best regional team in the world, including the Super 12 sides. They're very physical, very good at the breakdown and have a good wide game.'
