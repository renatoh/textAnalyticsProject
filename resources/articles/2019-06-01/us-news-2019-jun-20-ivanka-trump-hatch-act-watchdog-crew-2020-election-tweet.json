The influential Washington-based watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) has filed a complaint against Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, a senior presidential aide who works in the White House as an adviser, albeit unsalaried. In a letter to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), part of the Department of Justice, Crew said her tweet, posted on Father\u2019s Day last weekend, just a few days before Trump\u2019s re-election campaign launch in Florida, included his 2016 campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and claimed \u201cthe best is yet to come\u201d. The tweet in question reads: \u201cFour years ago today, I introduced my father @realDonaldTrump when he launched a Campaign that would forever change America. Because of his courage, Americans are safer and more prosperous\u2026and the best is yet to come!\u201d She signed off the tweet with the words \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day!\u201d and an emoji of the American flag. Accompanying the message was an image from the June 2015 event at Trump Tower when Trump launched his presidential run that shows her applauding her father to the backdrop of a campaign banner emblazoned with her father\u2019s name and now infamous slogan. Crew also claimed she had used her government Twitter account, which has more than 6.5 million followers and on which she describes herself as \u201cadviser to Potus\u201d to share \u201cmultiple partisan political posts\u201d since March last year. In the letter to the special counsel, Henry Kerner, dated 20 June 2019, Crew\u2019s executive director, Noah Bookbinder, requests that the OSC investigate Ivanka Trump and says she \u201cviolated the Hatch Act by using her social media account\u201d. It reads: \u201cThese actions were directed specifically toward the success or failure of Donald J Trump, a candidate in a partisan election. By sharing these posts on a Twitter account that Ms Trump uses for official government business, Ms Trump engaged in political activity prohibited by law.\u201d It also cites OSC social media guidance, which states that federal employees \u201cmay not engage in political activity while on duty or in the federal workplace\u201d. The president\u2019s daughter, who on Thursday attended the launch of the 2019 Trafficking in Persons Report with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has yet to comment on the claims. Bookbinderadded: \u201cIt has become clear that this rampant abuse of public office is not a problem of one bad apple but rather a key feature of the Trump White House.\u201d He said: \u201cBy blatantly using her office for politics right after the Office of Special Counsel recommended her colleague be fired for repeatedly acting similarly, Ivanka Trump has basically thumbed her nose at the OSC and the rule of law. Never before have we witnessed this level of illegal politicized behavior, and it must not be allowed to continue.\u201d The \u201ccolleague\u201d refers to Kellyanne Conway, who serves as a counselor to the president. The complaint comes just a week after the OSC called on the president to fire Conway over multiple violations of the Hatch Act. The OSC criticized Conway in a report addressed to Trump as a \u201crepeat offender\u201d of the Act and claimed she had \u201cshown disregard for the law\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
