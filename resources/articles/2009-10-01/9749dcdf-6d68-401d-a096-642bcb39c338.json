The England and Wales Cricket Board has hinted that it might leave the captain and other senior players out of the squad for the two Test matches and three one-day internationals in the spring, but Vaughan fears that if a clear decision is not reached now, the issue will be fudged next year. Strauss has said a decision will not be taken until after the tour to South Africa is over. \"This needs to be addressed now. Andrew Strauss should be rested for that trip, as should Paul Collingwood, as should Jimmy Anderson,\" Vaughan said. \"They should announce it now because until they do, if the South Africa series goes wrong, then I guarantee that Strauss, Anderson, Collingwood will end up going to Bangladesh. I know what will happen. I've been in the job and I know what happens with the England selectors and I know what happens with the England team. \"We might lose in South Africa, we might lose heavily. Then everyone will start to worry about their position in the team, about young guys coming in. They will know that whoever you put in the team for Bangladesh should do well, so the players will start to get a little bit frightened about their position in the side. The selectors will say, 'We must start winning again' ahead of the next Ashes. England have got to let the players know they're being rested now so that if the South Africa series doesn't go the way we want it to there is not a mass call for these guys to go Bangladesh.\" Vaughan made his remarks in an interview published on theguardian.com today, in which he addresses the issue of burn-out and addresses the changes he would like to see made in the running of English cricket, which include the expansion of the county game and the appointment of an eight-man board to run the sport. The stress of being away from his family, was, Vaughan says, \"one of the reasons I had to quit the captaincy. For five-and-a-half years I'd devoted every single moment of my life to being the England captain. I'd lived and slept in the job. It takes a toll. And at the end I just knew I had to get my life back.\"Cricket's administrators, Vaughan thinks, should \"look at playing a little bit less, and making the product that much better\". The benefits of a break, he points out, were obvious in the way Collingwood performed in the Champions Trophy after being rested in the recent one-day series against Australia that followed the Ashes. \"He came back and started believing in himself again,\" Vaughan said. \"He had a fresher mind. He needed to recharge his batteries. He came back and suddenly started hitting the ball. You need to be fresh to play at your maximum. More time at home for the players is paramount.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
