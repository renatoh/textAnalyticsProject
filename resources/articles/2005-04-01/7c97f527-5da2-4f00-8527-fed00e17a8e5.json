Manor represented the contemporary Israel experience, expressing the country's feelings in his songs. One, Abanibi, performed by Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta, won the Eurovision song contest for Israel in 1978. He was born in the settlement of Binyamina (halfway up the coastal plain), where \"everyone - except Ehud - was attached to the soil\". His instincts drew him to popular culture - not of pioneering Israel, but to the singers and songwriters of Broadway musicals. \"It was also a unique way of learning English,\" he recalled. After army service, he studied literature at the Hebrew University, and communications in New York. On returning to Israel, he began his multi-faceted career, writing songs and broadcasting radio programmes on popular music and films. Simultaneously, he pursued his academic studies in literature. His first venture into song-writing - with the young singer Chava Alberstein - already hinted at the new direction in which he was taking Israeli music. Formerly, songs related to the land and the people, war and heroism; Manor's innovation was to write about individual pain, love or joy, without reference to the national saga. This emphasis on personal experience marks Manor's genre, which includes more than 1,200 original songs. Typically, they came out of his own experience, and often expressed great intimacy. Everlasting Covenant was written on the occasion of his wedding: \"In a little while / we shall be one flesh / You will put your hand in mine / for ever / You will be mine forever / and I shall be afraid / and my body will tremble this night.\" Set to a Chopin-like melody by his longtime collaborator Matti Caspi, the song achieves an almost religious invocation of love, underscored by the title, with its strong biblical overtones. It also characterises Manor's skill in exposing his deepest emotions to public gaze. It was precisely this that made him so popular. When his younger brother, Yehuda, was killed in battle against Egyptian tanks in 1968, Manor wrote: \"My young brother Yehuda / Can you hear? / Do you know? / the sun still rises each morning / and its light is white / and in the evening the wind scatters / the leaves of the tree.\" The song, set to a haunting melody by Yohanan Zarai, was immediately taken up by the public. Manor's desire to be a popular writer was well expressed in the Eurovision song Abanibi, which, despite its success, upset some of his devotees. Soon afterwards, he went to Cambridge to write a doctorate in English literature on the hidden Jewish voice in Wesker, Pinter and Shaffer. Wishing to avoid embarrassment, he kept his Euro-win a secret. When it came out, he found himself feted by Cambridge dons, delighted to discover that they were hosting the \"man who won the Eurovision\". Manor translated more than 630 works into precise and poetic Hebrew, including three Shakespeare plays, Moli\u00e8re, musicals (among them Hair, Oliver and Grease) and, of course, many foreign songs. He is survived by his wife Ofra, and children Gali, Libi and Yehuda. \u00b7 Ehud Manor, songwriter, born July 13 1941; died April 11 2005"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
