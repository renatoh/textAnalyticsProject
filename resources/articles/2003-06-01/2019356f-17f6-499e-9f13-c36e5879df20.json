A new survey of 22,550 people aged 15 and over, carried out by opinion pollsters Sofres, has discovered that since 2000, the number of obese people has risen from 9.6% of the population to 11.3%. That is to say, France in 2003 is home to 5.4 million obese people (and a further 14.45 million who are overweight.) Those figures are rising at the frightening rate of 6% per year, and the trend affects people across the social spectrum. It is particularly worrying among the elderly, at a time when the government is to encourage France's ageing population to play a fuller role in society. \"If nothing changes, in 2020 the country will be in the same situation as the United States, where 30% of the population is overweight,\" says professor Arnaud Basdevant, head of nutrition at the H\u00f4tel-Dieu hospital in Paris. So while we French pride ourselves on our traditional recipes, prepared with the finest and freshest ingredients from farmers' markets, the somewhat indigestible truth is that - like our European neighbours - we are more likely to be found slouched in front of the television, one hand fiddling with the remote control and the other plunged deep into a kingsize bag of crisps. The causes of obesity are well known. Despite a huge drop in the amount of physical exercise they take, most folk eat as much if not more than they used to, and continue to show a predilection for the fattiest, sweetest foods. The ready-to-eat meals sold in supermarkets are more fattening than those cooked from fresh ingredients, yet these have become the staple diet of France's sedentary urbanites, and with alarming implications. In the Paris region, the number of obese people has increased by 70% since 1997. Yet ask us about our nation's eating habits and we appear to have our heads in the sand. More than three quarters of those polled by Sofres consider that they eat a well-balanced diet. They are wrong, says Marc Veyrat, whose restaurant La Ferme de Mon P\u00e8re in Meg\u00e8ve, eastern France, was awarded the highest of gastronomic accolades - three stars in the 2001 Michelin guide. \"In our consumer society, run by huge food suppliers, French people have lost the real flavours and the real delights that good cooking can bring out. You should go in a supermarket and have a look. Everything is refrigerated and it is impossible to let your senses guide you, even though this is where the pleasure of food comes from,\" he says. As for McDonald's and its French pretenders, Quick and Flunch, Veyrat is scathing. \"Of course, what they are doing is crap but I do not blame them. These firms produce odourless, colourless food, but from a marketing point of view they have a 50-year lead on us and this is why they are so successful and make our people fat,\" he says. \"If we in France can convince people that we make the best sandwiches because we bake the best bread, churn the best butter and cure the best ham, I don't think the consumer will think twice before going back to more traditional options.\" We French are becoming addicted to fast, cheap food and the country now suffers one of the steepest rises in obesity in Europe. Now that the myth of nutritious, healthy meals has been dismantled, more and more specialists are calling for high-level intervention and new government policies to combat the problem. \"Eat better and get off your backsides\" should be the new mantra not only in France, but throughout western Europe. Jacques Chirac has not yet declared fighting obesity a national priority. Indeed, he has spoken of his love of American junk food. Maybe it's time he had a change of heart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
