On Friday, 15 April, Leicestershire axed its drama and dance advisory service. For 40 years it had been a byword for excellence. On Tuesday 12 April, our renowned youth theatre gave its final performance. As director I expect I gave a similar speech to the one given by Michael Rose at the demise of the Bedford Youth Orchestra. Frontline arts services for young people have been declining since 1993 (the onset of local management of schools). These 2011 cuts are the final nail in the coffin for many providers of central services. David Cross Leicester"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
