Research published in Biology Letters has shown that when there are few females around, males will mate with other male damselflies. Experiments by Hans Van Gossum, from the University of Antwerp, and colleagues with varying ratios of male and female damselflies showed that when female damselflies were scarce, the males were attracted to each other. But if more female damselflies were introduced, the behaviour switched and the males became attracted to females again. \"When there are few females there is lots of competition and the pressure for males to recognise other females is intense,\" says Van Gossum.\"Possibly they are confusing male damselflies for females.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
