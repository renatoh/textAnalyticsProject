For the benefit of certain Fiver readers of a non-British disposition who may be unfamiliar with either the aforementioned gooey confection or the football tournament to which it has just become adhered as official \u201csnack partner\u201d, the former is a chocolate coated soft marshmallow on a biscuit base created by Sir Boyd Tunnock, while the latter is a Scottish knockout cup competition that could scarcely be less significant, even going by the standards of fitba. Contested by \u2026 deep breath \u2026 30 teams from the Scottish Professional Football League, four each from the Highland and Lowland Leagues, as well as two \u201cguest\u201d teams from the Norn Iron, O\u2019Ireland and Welsh top flights. Plus Wrexham and Solihull from England\u2019s National League are thrown in for good measure, just to make the whole thing a little more confusing. Previously sponsored by the bubblegum-flavoured, sugar-saturated and peculiarly Scottish hangover cure that is Irn-Bru, this competition to showcase the most mediocre football talent in Britain and O\u2019Ireland has now sold its soul to something that is arguably even more unhealthy. It will henceforth be known as the Tunnock\u2019s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup, in a nod to a biscuit conceived in 1952 that remains popular among the kind of people who were born around the same time. Having picked a slow news day to stage their attention-grabbing draw against a backdrop of highly distinctive red, yellow and white branding, the tournament sponsors have already succeeded in their fiendish aim of grabbing the kind of Fiver headlines no amount of money or tasty Scottish chocolate treats sent in bulk to our easily findable address can usually buy. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Paul Doyle for hot and steamy MBM coverage of Egypt 1-0 DR Congo in the Africa Cup of Nations at 9pm BST. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI like it being hot and we\u2019ve planned for it. If we keep passing it well, the ball won\u2019t get tired. It\u2019s our English mentality to worry about the weather. For two weeks at St George\u2019s Park my players essentially lived in a sauna. We wore thermals. The players enjoy hot weather, we feel good in the heat\u201d \u2013 Phil Neville laughs in the face of hellish \u201ckiller\u201d heatwaves when there\u2019s a World Cup to be won. FIVER LETTERS \u201cOn first glance, I was sure the lamp in the background of the photo of the pensively gazing Fawaz al-Hasawi (yesterdays News, Bits and Bobs) was the 1959 FA Cup trophy, inconspicuously disguised as a lamp. I immediately thought what a good sense of humour this chap must have\u201d \u2013 James Ryan. \u201cCan you do something for me please, Fiver? Can you refer to them as Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea for a while? It might catch on as a thing if someone with as much influence as you took it up and it\u2019d make the past year or so for Derby County, seemingly spent as Chelsea\u2019s asset-polishing club, slightly more bearable\u201d \u2013 Louise Wright. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see that the fun and games in South America Dept is alive and kicking (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs). I did wonder if it had succumbed to the cull that is rife in much of the traditional media. Next up must be the rehiring of the 1,057 pedants who seem to have gone missing too\u201d \u2013 Luke McLean. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure this qualifies as nominative determinism (Fiver letters passim), but I remember a joiner a few years ago now, who drove round in a van with his name on the side. \u2018Terry Bell, Joiner.\u2019 You had to wonder\u201d \u2013 Paul Dixon.

Egypt\u2019s Amr Wada has been sent home from the Africa Cup of Nations after a number of women alleged that he harassed them on various social media disgraces. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely out,\u201d sniffed Egypt boss Ihab Leheita. \u201cWe have a match to focus on.\u201d Aaron Wan-Bissaka is this close to being Phil Jones\u2019s teammate after Crystal Palace agreed a fee of \u00a345m with Manchester United for the full-back. Jack Clarke, who wasn\u2019t born when Radiohead released Kid A, is coughing for the doctor at Spurs after Nasty Leeds accepted a \u00a310m offer plus add-ons for the wee scamp of a winger. Just because he likes a certain number, hipster fans\u2019 favourite David Silva is going to say adios to Manchester City at the end of next season. \u201cIt completes the cycle. It\u2019s a nice round figure. I can never see myself playing against City for another team. So 10 years \u2013 that\u2019s it,\u201d he randomly announced in Gran Canaria. And in what could rank as the quickest delivery at Anfield since Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s corner against Barcelona, Denise Jones \u2013 who was attending a Pink gig at the ground on Tuesday night \u2013 went into labour and gave birth to a baby girl called Dolly Pink within minutes.
