Everton's Australian midfielder was charged following his clash with Newcastle defender Celestine Babayaro on Sunday. Referee Howard Webb failed to punish the pair, who were shown on TV to throw punches at each other as they jostled for a free-kick in the box. The FA charged both players yesterday and Newcastle immediately accepted the ruling, with Babayaro banned for three games. Everton will now also lose their man for three games with Cahill ruled out of Saturday's trip to Blackburn and subsequent games against Manchester United and West Ham. The Toffees, who won the Premiership match 1-0, sent a report defending their player to an FA commission which met today after analysing footage of the incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
