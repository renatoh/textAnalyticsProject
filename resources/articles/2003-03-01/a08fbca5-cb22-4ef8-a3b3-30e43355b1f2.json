Legal opinion varies on the basis for war under resolution 1441, but yesterday Cherie Booth's own legal chambers, Matrix, advised there was no authority for war without an unambiguous fresh resolution. Now it has emerged that there are fears within the government's legal service about the exact provisions of international law for a US-UK attack. The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, has already flown to Washington on an unpublicised trip to discuss the legal ramifications with the US attorney general, John Ashcroft. Lord Goldsmith's job is to advise ministers on the legality of all their actions, but his office has refused to divulge his opinion on a future war with Iraq. This morning he was forced to deny to the Financial Times rumours that he may resign if bombs are dropped without a second UN resolution. His office is quoted as saying this scenario was \"not something he recognises\", but the FT quotes an unnamed mandarin as saying: \"Civil servants are meant to respect the law. There will be lots of resignations from the government legal service. Lord Goldsmith could go.\" The FT reported last year that the attorney general warned the cabinet any war designed primarily to remove Saddam Hussein would be illegal. However, the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, said last week he was unworried by the legal debate. He said: \"As a lawyer myself, I have always taken the view that if the law was so clear, you wouldn't need my profession. So I accept there are going to be differences of legal opinion.\" Yesterday the Green party, CND and the Campaign Against the Arms Trade obtained a ruling from Matrix chambers that the draft wording of the US-UK second resolution - that Iraq had \"failed to take the final opportunity\" of 1441 and the UN remained \"seized of the matter\" - was not sufficient authority for military action. It has already argued that resolution 1441 does not in itself constitute grounds for war. Campaigners today restated their belief that the second resolution proposed by the US, Britain and Spain does not legally authorise a war against Iraq. Lawyers, MPs and anti-war campaigners today held a meeting to discuss legal work which stated that military action against Saddam Hussein's regime would violate international law. Today's meeting was led by Phil Shiner, of Public Interest Lawyers, who repeated the views voiced by Matrix lawyers Rabinder Singh QC and Charlotte Kilroy. Mr Shiner accused the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, of \"clever spinning\" to make the general public believe that a second resolution would give the US and UK a mandate for war. \"The question of legality is this: will it be lawful or will it not be lawful to go to war on the present draft resolution? \"I am saying without hesitation that it will not be,\" he said. Mr Shiner, whose group specialises in international law, said he stood by the opinion of Mr Singh and Ms Kilroy that unless there was a further resolution clearly authorising force, the US and UK would be acting against international law with an attack on Iraq. Describing the vague wording of the present draft resolution, on which UN security council members will vote in the coming weeks, he said: \"It is meant to be bland. It is meant to say nothing.\" He added; \"There is nothing in this present draft that can be twisted to mean that there is an authority to go to war. \"I want to underline that I would like to see journalists and MPs expose this for what it is. It is nothing more than a con trick.\" Talking about the wording of UN resolution 1441, Mr Shiner said the threat of \"serious consequences\" over noncompliance with weapons laws was meant as a warning to Iraq, and not a threat of war. On the question of \"material breach\", Mr Shiner said that too did not authorise war but was something for the security council to decide on. Mr Shiner said: \"Are we going to let the UK get away with a very clear violation of international law? \"Secondly, are we going to let them get away with this second resolution? \"And thirdly, are we going to do something about their behaviour before we go to war and there is a repeat of what happened in 1991?\" Among the MPs present at the meeting today were Jeremy Corbyn and Lynne Jones. Mr Corbyn asked what legal options were open to anti-war campaigners in light of the time constraints. Mr Shiner said they had been told \"in very clear terms\" that this was not a matter that could be pursued through the law courts and there was not the option of a judicial review. He added that extending the ideological battle and highlighting the illegality of the resolution was seen as the main way forward to gather more support from the public and MPs. Mr Corbyn said that he believed a select committee should be set up to debate the matter, with Mr Shiner or the lawyers from Matrix Chambers invited to give evidence. Also present at the meeting, held in Portcullis House, was Hans von Sponeck, who was head of the UN humanitarian assistance programme in Iraq from 1998 to 2000. Members of CND and other campaigners also attended, along with comedian Mark Thomas. Earlier today, Mr Thomas and a group of protesters piled manure outside the Labour party's headquarters in Westminster to demonstrate against an Iraqi conflict."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
