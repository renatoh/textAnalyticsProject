In a discussion on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour, which she is guest-editing on Monday, the Sex and the City actor says that being a mother is not just about giving birth and changing nappies. \u201cI am not a biological parent, but I am a parent. I have young actors and actresses that I mentor, I have nieces and nephews that I am very close to,\u201d she tells host Jane Garvey. \u201cThere is a way to become a mother in this day and age which doesn\u2019t include your name on the child\u2019s birth certificate. You can express that maternal side, very clearly, very strongly. It feels very satisfying. \u201cI didn\u2019t change nappies, which is okay with me, but I did help my niece get through medical school. I did sit down with my nephew when he was [going through] a very tough time to join the army. And those are very motherly things to do, very nurturing things to do.\u201d Cattrall reflects on the way she and other women in her position are labelled. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018less\u2019 that is offensive: childless \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019re less because you haven\u2019t had a child,\u201d she says. \u201cI think for a lot of women from my generation it wasn\u2019t a conscious choice. It was a feeling of: \u2018Well, I\u2019m on this road and things are going really well, I\u2019m really happy, I\u2019ll do it next year, I\u2019ll do it two years, I\u2019ll do it in five years.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd then suddenly you\u2019re in your early 40s and you think: \u2018Maybe now?\u2019 And you go to your doctor and she says: \u2018Yes we can do this but you have to start to become a bit of a science experiment here because we have to find out how you can stay pregnant.\u2019 \u201cAnd I just thought: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I want it that much.\u2019\u201d The 59-year-old, who was born in Liverpool but moved to Vancouver as a baby, appeared earlier this year in Sensitive Skin, a Canadian remake of the decade-old Hugo Blick drama starring Joanna Lumley, about a successful fiftysomething with a fear of losing her youth. Ageing, and what it is like being single in later life, is another issue she addresses on Woman\u2019s Hour. Cattrall concedes that men may be too intimidated to ask her out. \u201cI\u2019m not your average single woman. I come with, as all men and women of a certain age, they come with baggage,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for everybody. To be single at this age is really difficult, because you know so much more about what you want and what you don\u2019t want and what you\u2019ll put up with, and you\u2019ve been there and done that so many times at this point. I have anyway. I feel in that area, romantically, retired.\u201d Other guests taking part in Woman\u2019s Hour Takeover week are businesswoman and founder of Ultimo lingerie Michelle Mone, FGM awareness campaigner Nimko Ali, Anglican bishop Rachel Treweek and children\u2019s author Dame Jacqueline Wilson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
