Jason Roberts, the former Blackburn Rovers striker who is a member of the Sports People\u2019s Think Tank that commissioned the research, said the figures were very worrying and showed that despite increased focus on the issue football compared poorly with other industries in tackling the root of the problem. While he praised the Football League for introducing a version of the Rooney rule, under which shortlists for first-team managers will feature at least one BME candidate from next year, he said most in football were still \u201cmessing with the fluffy stuff at the edges\u201d rather than challenging exclusion and ingrained practices. A year ago, research by Dr Steven Bradbury of Loughborough University revealed that just 19 of 552 of the top jobs in coaching and management were filled by BME people. By September 2015 that figure had risen to 23 by virtue of an increase in the number of first-team managers from two to six. That equates to just 4.2% of all senior coaching positions, compared with 25% BME representation among professional players and 14% among the population as a whole. Overall, Roberts said the lack of progress reflected the fact that not enough was being done to force football to face up to the issues. \u201cThere is a structural exclusion of a group. This was a matter of urgency for us last year and even more so this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe narrative seems to be that we have a structural issue around inclusion so you guys need to work harder. But then there are no positions when we come through.\u201d The Premier League has introduced a new scheme to try to bring through a new cohort of coaches from BME backgrounds with Uefa pro licence qualifications and the FA has also promised to fast-track the best and brightest BME coaches. But Roberts sad there was little sign of progress on the ground. \u201cDo we have to wait 30 years? When will we have a black England manager? If you look at the diversity behind the scenes at the FA, it won\u2019t be in my lifetime.\u201d Dr Bradbury concluded that within the game conscious and unconscious racial bias \u201cconstitute a form of institutional discrimination which continue to limit the potential for equality of opportunities and outcomes for BME coaches in the professional football environment\u201d. He said that overall progress has been slow and statistical advances minimal. Roberts said that while great strides had been made over the past two decades in combatting racist attitudes on the pitch and in the stands, the closed networks and unconscious bias surrounding recruitment of coaches was \u201cmore insidious and a more difficult issue to deal with\u201d. \u201cYou are talking about a small number of people who are handing out those roles. It\u2019s no longer: \u2018Can they play in the cold?\u2019 or: \u2018Can they play at centre half?\u2019\u201d he said, also pointing to slow progress in making boardrooms more representative. \u201cIt\u2019s now become: \u2018Can they manage? Can they coach? Can they lead?\u2019 You\u2019re asking people to ask themselves some very difficult questions.\u201d Following the angst of the John Terry and Luis Su\u00e1rez racism incidents, football\u2019s governing bodies drew up a 92-point plan around diversity issues following a summit at 10 Downing Street. But Roberts said that apart from the Football League\u2019s initiative not enough had been done to practically improve the opportunities for those from a BME background to ascend the coaching ladder. \u201cWe\u2019re messing with the fluffy stuff around the edges. Of course it is always a given that people have to upskill themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we recognise we have a structural issue, the game has got to do something about it. We\u2019re not taking up that mantle.\u201d He said he was disappointed that the Premier League and FA had not followed the Football League\u2019s example and introduced a version of the Rooney Rule. \u201cAn adapted version of the Rooney Rule is an easy win. It hurts nobody and if you\u2019re not good enough you don\u2019t get the job,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with quotas. It\u2019s about giving people not part of the employment process the opportunity to get a fair hearing. That\u2019s why we\u2019re pleased the Football League is taking a lead and disappointed with the rest of the football establishment.\u201d There are currently no BME managers in the Premier League and six in the Football League: QPR\u2019s Chris Ramsey, Brighton\u2019s Chris Hughton, Huddersfield\u2019s Chris Powell, Burton\u2019s Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Ricardo Moniz of Notts County and Keith Curle of Carlisle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
