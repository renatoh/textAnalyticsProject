As he works the till in the clothes store he has run in Athens for the past six years, the Chinese merchant can barely suppress his joy. \"The Greeks like my prices and business is good. See! They buy in bulk,\" he says as one customer pays \u20ac6 (\u00a34) for three \"Goodfeel\" cotton shirts produced in China's Zheng Jing province. \"Why pay \u20ac25 for a blouse when you can buy one for \u20ac3 here?\" said Kalotina Stefanidis, who had travelled from a far-flung Aegean island just to shop. Further down the street, Tili Zhou also sits behind the till in her basement \"Chinese clothes market\". While other Greek-owned stores have shut for the weekend, Ms Zhou passes the time while she is waiting for customers by chatting over the internet with her 11-year-old daughter. \"Ching-Ching lives in Shanghai. For the past year, me and her father have lived here,\" she says matter-of-factly. \"This is our life,\" she adds, pointing to the countless bundles of clothes spilling out of cardboard boxes around the room. Qing and Zhou are not alone. In Greece, and particularly Athens, hundreds of Chinese have emerged selling wares from clothes to calculators, lint removers and walking sticks, at a pace that has put Greece on the frontline of Europe's textile trade war with China. The country's 17% increase in imports of cheap Chinese goods was the second biggest in the EU last year. With Chinese imports exceeding \u20ac1.4bn in 2004 - four times more than eight years ago - Greece lags behind only the Netherlands in the invasion. Demand is such that the first of several multi-storey Chinese shopping malls will open in the capital next month. The surge has made Greece a case study for those who fear the commerce will hurt Europe. \"Okay, they're cheap but the competition isn't fair. Greek enterprises are closing and they're opening everywhere,\" grumbled Yiannis Vliagothis, a former shopkeeper turned car-park assistant. Mr Vliagothis said his family recently shut down the shoe shop it had owned for three generations because it could not make ends meet. \"We had owned it for the last 150 years, from my grandfather's time. I have nothing against Chinese but they live and work in conditions that my father experienced 50 years ago. Is that what we have to do, go back in time, to become competitive?\" Alarmed officials say the only way for locals to outdo their new rivals is to make better quality products at more competitive prices. Although fiercely pro-market, the ruling centre-right government says it will step up controls to ensure the spirit of free trade is not violated. Speaking to the Guardian yesterday, Athens' deputy commerce minister, Manoussos Voulodakis, said: \"There are strong suggestions that the surge in imports is not just a sign of the strength of the Chinese economy and textile trade but the result of the violation of EU and national laws, practices that make competition unfair.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
