After Claire Emslie had pulled one back for Scotland in Nice, England could have sat back. Instead they remained on the front foot and Houghton emphasised a desire and fight within the team as crucial to that strategy. \u201cThis is a team that wants more and we\u2019ve got the players to go and do that,\u201d said the England captain. \u201cEspecially with the likes of Lucy [Bronze]and Nikita [Parris] bombing down the right hand side, Ellen\u2019s [White] always in the box trying to get goals and for us. Maybe on another day we\u2019d have scored a few more, but look we\u2019re creating chances, which is a good thing. It\u2019s quite scary that we know we can play quite a bit better.\u201d Scotland set up with five in the middle, forcing Arsenal\u2019s Kim Little too deep and leaving Erin Cuthbert isolated up top. That handed England control. \u201cFor us that first half performance is what this England team is about,\u201d said Houghton. \u201cWe were full of energy, we were pressing, we were passing the ball well, we got the two goals and it could have been more. We dropped off a little in the second half, which we\u2019re a bit disappointed with.\u201d That dropping off let the Scots back in the game, a stray pass from Houghton leading to Emslie\u2019s goal. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of build up to this game, I\u2019m not making excuses, we can be better and we can pass the ball better,\u201d Houghton added. \u201cIt was my mistake for the goal but ultimately we\u2019re a team and it was about getting the first three points on the board.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got good team-mates around me, my job is to be brave and play out from the back and I do that every single week whether that\u2019s for England or for club so it\u2019s not going to stop me from doing that. There\u2019s going to be wrong decision making sometimes but ultimately it was all about the win today.\u201d The conditions also tested the players. \u201cIt was humid out there, it was hot and sweaty, it takes your breath away in the first 10 minutes and we played at a tempo where we knew that Scotland wouldn\u2019t be able to cope with us,\u201d said Houghton. \u201cBut we\u2019re capable of doing that for 90 minutes.\u201d England\u2019s victory was marred slightly by an injury to Houghton\u2019s defensive partner Millie Bright, who landed awkwardly on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not good to see Millie go off but then Abbie [McManus]has come in and made her World Cup debut. She\u2019s got a lot of experience. So, for us, keeping the ball maybe could have been a bit better but at the same time we don\u2019t need to be peaking in this first game, we don\u2019t need to be playing the best football we can be playing and as players we want to keep improving.\u201d Houghton also said she will not be wary of the position of her arms despite the tougher handball rules and the deployment of VAR at the tournament, after Scotland\u2019s Nicola Docherty was penalised when the ball hit her arm in the box - leading to Parris scoring from the penalty spot and giving England a 14th-minute lead at the Stade de Nice. \u201cObviously consciously you might think about it a little bit more but at the same time you\u2019ve got to be natural,\u201d said Houghton. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try and get up to the ball and stay close to your player, so we know there\u2019s things that might have to change but ultimately we\u2019ve got to this point, we\u2019re playing for England and we\u2019re going to keep doing the same things. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had meetings with the referees, we\u2019re all clear with how VAR works and ultimately you want the rules to be fair. I\u2019m sure if that was us giving that handball away then Scotland would be saying exactly the same as us and taking the penalty. I\u2019ve not seen it back but ultimately the referee makes the decision.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
