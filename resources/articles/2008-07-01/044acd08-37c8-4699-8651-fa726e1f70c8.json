It's not exactly Ratatouille (the Pixar people are altogether deeper and subtler than DreamWorks), but it's a great deal of fun, devoid of romantic interest, avoiding sententious moral platitudes until the final reel and with no songs until the end credits which are accompanied by Black's rendition of Carl Douglas's 1974 hit 'Kung Fu Fighting'. The story is simple. Po is accidentally chosen by Oogway, the geriatric turtle who invented kung fu, as the new Dragon Warrior, much to the disgust of an ace quintet called the Furious Five, composed of the species rainbow coalition of Tigress, Viper, Mantis, Monkey and Crane. Suddenly, he has to go through a crash course so he can face the ferocious snow leopard Tai Lung, a rebel Lucifer to Oogway's orderly God. The film both mocks and celebrates the ancient Oriental codes of honour, discipline and suppression of self. As the guru says: 'Yesterday is history, tomorrow is mystery, today is a gift, which is why it is called the present', a neatly poised sentiment that begins with Confucius, moves into Hallmark and ends as Mel Brooks and Woody Allen. What impresses on the screen and remains in the mind are the setpieces: a brilliantly stylised opening dream sequence, Tai Lung's escape from the country's most maximum security prison, the diminutive kung fu master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) using food to sharpen Po's martial skills and a fantastic fight on a rope bridge. In the end, cuisine and kung fu are reconciled in what could well have been called 'Kill Bill of Fare'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
