Given the \u00a330m I've spent, mediocrity is not acceptable. \"I'm not having this group of players here next season. There will be dramatic changes in the summer. I have players here who have no appetite for real success. \"They're earning eight grand a week and they have a big-time Charlie attitude. I'm not watching next year what I've had to watch this year. At times we've been a disgrace.\" The chairman had expected Palace to challenge for promotion but their FA Cup win at Liverpool has been followed by a slump which sees them in mid-table. \"The players will be told when it suits me,\" he added. \"I care about them as much as they care about me.\" The former Palace chairman Ron Noades has resigned as chairman and director of Brentford and handed over to the Bees United Supporters Trust after criticism of his plan to sell Griffin Park before securing a new stadium. He will continue to support the overdraft of about \u00a34.5m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
