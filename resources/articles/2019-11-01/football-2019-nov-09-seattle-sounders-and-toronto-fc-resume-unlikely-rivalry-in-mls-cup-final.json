Most derbies are rivalries, but not all rivalries are derbies. Some in Major League Soccer circles are often guilty of conflating the two. The so-called 401 Derby between the Montreal Impact and Toronto FC, for instance, isn\u2019t really a derby. Neither is the contest between the Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC given that there is over 2,500 miles between the two clubs. And yet circumstances have certainly made them rivals. Indeed, this Sunday will mark the third time in four years that Seattle and TFC have met in the MLS Cup final. While most of the focus in MLS these past two seasons has been on Atlanta United and Los Angeles FC, two shiny new franchises who have set new standards across the board, the Seattle Sounders v Toronto FC has flown under the radar to become the league\u2019s defining fixture. It\u2019s not quite Arsenal-Manchester United of the late 1990s and early 2000s, but there now exists an edge between the two clubs that previously wasn\u2019t there. \u201cWhen you play a team once and then twice in a major championship game and you each get a win, sure\u2026 that\u2019s going to build a rivalry,\u201d says Brad Humber, a TFC fan and member of the Red Patch Boys supporters\u2019 group. \u201cFor a Western Conference team, they are our biggest rivals from that conference considering what has happened these past few years.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the MLS Cup final most predicted. LAFC dominated the regular season from start to finish, picking up the Supporters\u2019 Shield without much to slow them down. No MLS team had ever entered the play-offs so widely favored to go all the way. Atlanta United weren\u2019t quite as strong, but as defending champions with the star power of players like Josef Martinez and Pity Martinez, it was difficult to see who would topple them in the East. Few accounted for the momentum Seattle and Toronto FC would build over the play-offs, with the former unbeaten in their last seven seven home games and the latter unbeaten in their last 13 home and away. It was a similar story in 2016 and 2017, when momentum was the biggest factor in both teams\u2019 run to the MLS Cup final. What isn\u2019t similar is the venue for this weekend\u2019s clash. The last two Sounders-Toronto FC MLS Cup finals were played at BMO Field. This time, CenturyLink Field will host and there won\u2019t be an empty seat in the house, with over 69,000 tickets sold almost as soon as they were made publicly available. It will be the most-attended soccer match ever in the state of Washington. Of course, with this being Seattle\u2019s first ever home MLS Cup final it\u2019s likely that this demand would have existed no matter who the opposition, but the fact that it\u2019s Toronto FC who will be in town has made the billing that little bit more attractive. With the Sounders winning in 2016 and TFC winning in 2017, this feels like something of a decider. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t even expect this to happen in the first place,\u201d adds Humber, who along with his Red Patch Boys members, will be vastly outnumbered inside CenturyLink Field this Sunday. Nonetheless, around 3,000 TFC fans are expected at the game, with so many supporters making the journey out West that Humber will be forced to fly from Buffalo on Friday morning. The rivalry between the Sounders and TFC hasn\u2019t been sparked entirely from scratch. There already existed some form of sporting friction between the two cities owing to Seattle\u2019s proximity to the Canadian border. \u201cWhenever the Toronto BlueJays come to play the [Seattle] Mariners, the stadium is about 80% Toronto fans,\u201d explains Cameron Collins, a member of the Gorilla FC Seattle Sounders supporters\u2019 group. \u201cThere\u2019s already a sort of Seattle-Toronto, Seattle-Canada rivalry. I think even though that\u2019s a different sport there\u2019s just that little bit of feeling there that adds to it. If it\u2019s not a rivalry now, it will be after this.\u201d This is a match that has created memories in recent years, if not goals. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll actually score a goal in MLS Cup this time because even though we\u2019ve won one we didn\u2019t score in either game,\u201d adds Collins, recalling the 0-0 draw, and \u2018The Save\u2019, that led to a penalty shootout win for the Sounders and the 2-0 defeat the year after. There will be more of an onus on Seattle, being the home side, to take the game to TFC this time. This is a match that could be decided by which talismanic attacker \u2013 Raul Ruidiaz or Alejandro Pozuelo, with Jozy Altidore expected to stay sidelined \u2013 can get hottest in the Pacific Northwest rain that\u2019s forecast for this weekend. These two teams are experienced and won\u2019t be affected by the occasion, no matter how much of a spectacle 69,000 fans make it. An MLS Cup final is always special regardless of who is involved, but this one arrives with a little extra sparkle, particularly from the Seattle Sounders point of view. This will be the first time that MLS\u2019s original mega-franchise has hosted North American soccer\u2019s showpiece event. \u201cThis time I get to go with my parents, my girlfriend and one of my best friends and we\u2019re all going to sit together,\u201d says Collins. \u201cThis time it\u2019s more of a Seattle event.\u201d That doesn\u2019t meant Toronto FC can\u2019t claim the night as their own, though."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
