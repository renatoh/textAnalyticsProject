That doesn't mean they're right \u2013 groupthink is a bad policy guide. But it's not always wrong. And now that Sally Davies has joined the Commons home affairs committee, the UK Drug Policy Commission, the Global Commission on Drug Policy and more than half of all British voters in support of treating drug abuse as a medical rather than a criminal problem, it is surely time for the government to look again. Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for the past three years, used an interview on BBC Radio 3 to do two quite specific things. She acknowledged that she had a fleeting experiment with cannabis as a student in the 1970s. And she said that addiction is \"of course\" a medical problem, which becomes a public health problem that society chooses to treat as a criminal justice issue. This is not quite a full-throated cry for decriminalisation, although she has in the past warned that when possession is a criminal offence it deters people from seeking help. It also hints at the difficulties of having a sensible discussion about drugs policy. The statistics are nonetheless powerful. In England and Wales as many as 80% of shoplifting offences and almost as large a proportion of thefts are drug-related. Each year, tonnes of heroin and cocaine are seized abroad and at ports in the UK. Some countries in South America are struggling free of the drugs cartels. Others, notably Mexico, are in the grip of bloody gang wars. More than 40 years after a war on drugs was first declared, this does not look like victory. The trouble is that other statistics are not telling at all. One analysis of media coverage of deaths found that 2% of alcohol-related deaths were reported nationally, 7% of paracetamol-related deaths, and 100% of ecstasy-related ones. That's why politicians in office are so neuralgic about drugs policy. Professor David Nutt's attempt to highlight the distorted perceptions of drug abuse harms when he was the government's chief drugs adviser swiftly led to his sacking. Only a serving home secretary could doubt Professor Nutt's case that when damage to society as well as individuals is taken into account, alcohol causes more harm than any other drug. Portugal has successfully decriminalised the possession of small amounts of some drugs. New Zealand has just introduced regulation for recreational drugs. At the very least, the Home Office should hand over responsibility for drugs policy to the Department for Health. And if even that feels too risky, then start developing policy based on evidence rather than emotion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
