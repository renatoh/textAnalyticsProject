Headteacher Tony McCourt of St Aidan's secondary school in Ashbrooke, Sunderland, today has prohibited the use of mobile phones with cameras at school for fear that images may be used on the internet by paedophiles. His action comes after yesterday's publication of a report by John Carr, internet consultant for children's charity NCH, that a rise in child pornography can be attributed to the increasing use of the internet. When asked his response to St Aidan's ban, Mr Carr said about the new generation of mobile phones: \"The charity believes that both children and adults need to be better educated about their use, and that a blanket ban is not the answer. \"Mobile telephones with cameras will increasingly become a reality and we need to work to find practical solutions.\" Mr McCourt said there was no concrete evidence that images of his pupils had been used for nefarious purposes by pornographers. He told BBC Radio Newcastle: \"We want to prevent the unexpected happening. It's not a draconian measure, we just feel it is common sense.\" Mr McCourt said the popularity of sending picture messages to other mobile users was hard to fight among his pupils, particularly as it was being promoted by the England football captain David Beckham. A spokesperson for Vodafone, the network whose campaigns feature Beckham, said: \"We support the judicious use of mobile phones. If the teacher thinks the best way to control the use of mobile phones in his school is to ban them, then we're not going to turn around and say that's wrong.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
