It is a big money event, with high entry fees but first prizes of several thousand dollars even for weaker sections. Its continued success reflects a ruthless policy by the organisers towards rating cheats, coupled with a highly flexible schedule. The final rounds are on Independence Day, but it is possible to compete anywhere between three and seven days and to re-enter if you start badly. For GMs in the top section, it can be a vicious battle. They normally get a minimum guarantee, but for real success they have to finish in the top half-dozen. There is often a multiple tie for first, but the 2010 event this month had a runaway winner. The Czech Viktor Laznicka, 22, won his first six games then coasted to 7.5/9 with draws. There was also a fine UK success, as the England No3, Luke McShane, 26, scored an unbeaten 7/9 to earn $5,000 (\u00a33,200) in joint second with GMs from India and Israel. McShane is now leading in the Canadian Open in Toronto which ends on Sunday. This World Open game shows how GMs play sharp lines in the final money rounds. The Dutch 1...f5 normally plans e6, d5 and Ne4, but Black chose the more provocative d6 and g6 formation. Missing the best chance for activity (11...Qa5!) Black fell for the well-judged knight sac 14 Ncxd5! with a sustained and decisive attack. At the end if hxg5 25 Rxh8+ Kxh8 26 d7 Rg8 27 Rc8 and White will queen.
