That'll do for Jose Mourinho, right? Utterly, utterly wrong. For 20 minutes last night Stamford Bridge was ablaze as this season's Premiership masters of the niggardly 1-0 win stormed to an unimaginable three-goal lead, thanks to lethally direct counter-attacking and a slice of luck. Confronting the team generally reckoned to be the most potent exponents of pure attacking football in Europe, Mourinho astonished no one by including a surprise on his teamsheet. The presence of Mateja Kezman alongside Eidur Gudjohnsen suggested that the Portuguese coach had the scoring of goals in mind. But he can never have imagined the opening quarter of this match. Chelsea's start was simply beyond Mourinho's wildest dreams. Gudjohnsen's opening goal provided a masterclass in how to hit your opponents on the break. Damien Duff's third came from glorious passes by Kezman and Joe Cole. And if the intervening goal owed everything to the deflection and the goalkeeper's parry that placed the ball in Frank Lampard's path at point-blank range, then it was only a fair reward for the urgency with which Chelsea had attacked the match. But then Paulo Ferreira was adjudged to have handled the ball by Pierluigi Collina, praised by Mourinho this week as the man he would want to referee every game in which his side is involved, and the complexion of the evening changed completely. Ronaldinho slid the penalty past Petr Cech and then, with the instant cold-eyed opportunism of the master assassin, hit home a wonderful instant shot to restore Barcelona's lead in the tie. If you are going to concede two goals at home for only the second time this season, then Fifa's world player of the year might well be the man who is going to make you suffer. But even in the eight minutes before Gudjohnsen struck Chelsea's first goal, Barcelona's careful passing had given an indication of what might be to come. When they went 3-0 down they did not fold but kept playing their fluently expressive game, trusting in quality to bring them back as the gold shirts of their little midfield trio, Xavi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Deco, flickered across the turf. And so the brief but incandescent rivalry between Mourinho and Frank Rijkaard took another turn. Who could have guessed that the opening period of the match would have turned out to be a contrast between the furious attacking of Mourinho's players and the patient interplay of those sent out by Rijkaard? Stamford Bridge rocked and reeled as the gods turned their faces this way and that. Barcelona's 9,000 fans had brought balloons in the red and blue colours of the Blaugrana, but they seemed to have been efficiently pricked by Chelsea's opening onslaught. By half-time, however, they were once more floating merrily in the west London night air and their songs were silencing those of the home crowd. Only the harshest of purists would have suggested that the defensive generosity of both sides was perhaps a reason why these two great metropolitan clubs, each with a history illuminated by a galaxy of stars, have won the European Cup only once between them. If the half-time score from San Siro - 0-0 between Milan and Manchester United - might have seemed more pleasing to the connoisseur of the European Cup, this match offered the sort of intoxicating flavour of those great nights in the early years of the competition, when Real Madrid borrowed Brazil's philosophy of noting their opponents score and then simply scoring a few more. Last night, however, there seemed to be two Real Madrids on the pitch. Not that Mourinho will have appreciated the entertainment. This was not the way he sets out to win matches, not the way he took Porto to the Uefa Cup and the European Cup in successive seasons. And if he were going to give up the senior trophy, this would not be the way he wanted to do it. Although the scoring rate slowed down as the second half went on, there was no lessening of remarkable incident, each team responding to the other's initiative with an effort of their own. When Lampard's drive was deflected for a corner, and Victor Valdes plunged on to Gudjohnsen's header, the play went straight down the other end for Belletti to sting Cech's palms and for the goalkeeper to get down and tip away an effort from the resulting flag-kick. Given the rancorous preludes to both legs and the bad feeling after the match in the Camp Nou, the conduct of this match came as a relief. Under Collina's stern gaze both teams played hard and kept their complaints to a minimum. Not that they had much time to catch the referee's eye, thanks to the sheer pace of the play. Not until the 68th minute did Collina need to brandish a yellow card, when Xavi went down under a minimal challenge and lay on the grass complaining. Ricardo Carvalho's stunning and completely fair tackle on Samuel Eto'o, executed as the Cameroon forward seemed to have escaped him as he raced into the area, was more emblematic of the style of an extraordinary encounter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
