You do not have to support Catalan independence to support this principle \u2013 just as accepting the right to divorce does not mean endorsing a couple\u2019s separation. Imagine one partner in a marriage expressing doubts about whether the relationship is working, and the other vetoing not only a divorce, but any discussion of such an outcome. It would not only be an affront: it would simply fuel the desire for a separation on the part of the spouse. This has been the net consequence of the Spanish government\u2019s pigheadedness, its ruinous economic policies, its refusal to negotiate \u2013 and its brutal clampdown on civil liberties in Catalonia. The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, has shown commendable restraint after a referendum in which Spanish police dragged elderly women by their hair and injured hundreds of citizens exercising the most basic democratic right of all: the right to vote. More radical elements are agitating for a unilateral declaration of independence; Puigdemont has postponed such a move to allow for negotiations. But when the likes of Rafael Hernando \u2013 spokesman for Spain\u2019s ruling People\u2019s party \u2013 describes a pro-democracy Catalan general strike as a \u201cpolitical Nazi-style strike\u201d, there is clearly precious little goodwill for discussions in Madrid. The danger now is if Spain\u2019s rightwing government activates article 155 of the country\u2019s constitution, suppressing Catalan autonomy. Senior officials in Barcelona\u2019s administration fear this would provoke riots on Catalonia\u2019s streets and a renewed Spanish police crackdown \u2013 with frighteningly unpredictable consequences. Catalonia cannot be understood in isolation. Here is another manifestation of the crisis enveloping the western world: another morbid symptom of a decaying system. \u201c2017 may be the year when politics finally caught up with the crash of 2008,\u201d is how Jeremy Corbyn hailed Labour\u2019s recent surge, but the economic crisis spawned a vast array of political responses. It fuelled a new left that ranged from Greece\u2019s Syriza, Britain\u2019s Corbynism and Bernie Sanders in the US. It helped propel rightwing xenophobic populism, from Donald Trump to Farageism, France\u2019s Front National and the Austrian far-right. It certainly played a critical role in the Brexit result. But the crash also undoubtedly acted as a midwife for a surge in civic nationalism in Scotland and Catalonia. In the wake of the crash, Spain\u2019s economic turmoil ranked among the worst in Europe. Half its youngsters were out of work; hundreds of thousands of families were evicted as a decade-long property bubble imploded. And six years ago protesters \u2013 the indignados \u2013 occupied squares across Spain, including in Barcelona: it was the beginning of the end for a two-party establishment that had ruled the country since the end of Franco. But the political disillusionment that has become one of the defining characteristics of our age found a home in Catalonia. In 2012 up to 2 million Catalans marched in the so-called Diada \u2013 the National Day of Catalonia: many of them were fed up with stagnating living standards, unemployment and slashed public services. The governing centre-right nationalist forces capitalised on this mood, demanding that either the Rajoy government devolved more financial sovereignty, or Catalonia would be off. As the independence forces called for Catalans to escape the Spanish system, Podemos \u2013 Spain\u2019s new left party \u2013 and its allies called for the system to be overturned. The offer of independence, as Raphael Minder says in his invaluable new work, The Struggle for Catalonia, \u201cpromised change and prosperity in a new Catalan state, instead of stagnation in a rotten Spain\u201d. Nearly half of Catalans voted for pro-independence parties in 2015: the evidence suggests that support for secession doubled in a decade. It wasn\u2019t just the economic crisis which fuelled this pro-independence discontent, but the authoritarian and contemptuous behaviour of the People\u2019s party. A statute of autonomy \u2013 approved by referendum \u2013 defined Catalonia as a nation and gave special status to Catalan language. But the People\u2019s party successfully campaigned to have these clauses stripped away. Ever since, growing calls for an independence referendum have been aggressively resisted. Even worse, the People\u2019s party has relished inflaming the Catalan crisis for partisan reasons. Railing against Catalan \u201cseparatist\u201d forces, as Rajoy\u2019s administration calls them, stirs up Spanish nationalism and jingoism. Even more conveniently, diverting Spanish attention to the Catalan authorities helps distract the electorate from corruption scandals that have enveloped the ruling party for years. Some Catalan leftists \u2013 who support a referendum but oppose independence \u2013 fear that the Spanish government has already calculated that Catalonia is lost, and is simply stirring up resentment and grievance in the rest of Spain to gain political advantage. So what next? The EU has failed to explicitly condemn Rajoy\u2019s behaviour. It must now exert pressure on Spain\u2019s government to negotiate with Puigdemont and other politicians. The Canadian and British governments allowed independence referendums in Quebec and Scotland. Surely the Catalan people too should be allowed a free and fair vote without being brutalised by riot police. While the leftist Podemos party has sided with this democratic argument, the opposition Socialists \u2013 under pressure from more conservative elements \u2013 have so far failed to support what is surely the only possible resolution to this crisis. I have little truck with pro-independence movements unless a nation is oppressed, like those subjugated by Europe\u2019s former great powers \u2013 and Catalonia is not. Supporting Catalonia\u2019s right to divorce does not mean endorsing it. But when democracy comes under attack anywhere, it is our collective responsibility to show solidarity. There are those who point to the experience of Scotland and to Brexit, and say that all referendums do is bitterly divide nations. But the denial of a referendum in Catalonia has already done just that. If the Spanish government had actively wanted to drive Catalonia away, it is difficult to know what it would have done differently. It bears the greatest responsibility for this crisis. Ultimately, only a new Spanish government that addresses the endemic social and economic grievances afflicting Catalonia can guarantee that Spain does not fall apart. But this Spanish government has built a pressure cooker that is ready to blow. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
