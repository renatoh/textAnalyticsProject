Valentine's Day, dank and grey, produced an afternoon of passion, sweat and raunchy grappling that ended with Norwich, generally on top, coming up smelling of roses. In particular Darren Huckerby, back on his old stamping ground, had the scent. Most grounds are old stamping grounds of his but he enjoyed his best run here in terms of starts - fewer than 100 but 34 goals when Coventry were in the Premiership - and he set up both goals on Saturday. It was a match of compression rather than expression, notable mainly for its physical effort, but Huckerby found the space and sweet somethings to force the issue. The home fans, having booed him lightly, applauded him off warmly. Perhaps they recalled the \u00a34m received from Leeds. Norwich got him from Manchester City for \u00a3750,000, a measure of good business and changing times. He is 27 and sharp as ever. Nigel Worthington wants him \"to settle and enjoy his football\". Promotion would encourage him but Norwich, for all their traditional skills and new solidity, will need more quality to stay up. That can wait. Their back six, including the superb Gary Holt in front of four and the goalkeeper, have missed five games between them - a remarkable feat of fitness and discipline providing the base of their success. They now face West Ham, Sunderland, West Brom and Ipswich in succession and good heart from their lofty perch. The Canaries are singing again, stable off field too after the bottom-of-the-cage years under Robert Chase. Coventry competed with energy but little conviction that they had the weapons to hurt, despite the arrival of Eric Deloumeaux, the 20-year-old French midfielder whom Eric Black had at Motherwell. They topped the division's shots tables on and off target and added 10 to the latter total. Huckerby, a greyhound in the slips, was always threatening damage. The first goal came in a break direct from an inept Coventry corner, Holt forcing in. The second was a feed inside to Jim Brennan, whose shot was as true as Cupid's arrow, a bolt from the blue in the prevailing grey. Worthington said of Huckerby: \"He's so much talent you don't know what he's going to do.\" Black, having promised special measures, said: \"The only way to counter pace is with pace and we didn't have any.\" Thus Sky Blue thinking. Man of the match: Darren Huckerby (Norwich City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
