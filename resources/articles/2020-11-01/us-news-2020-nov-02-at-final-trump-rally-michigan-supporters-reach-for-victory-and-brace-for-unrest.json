Trump delivered his speech at midnight in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a critical swing state where the president is hoping for a repeat of 2016, when he unexpectedly beat Hillary Clinton. In the darkness, as temperatures dipped to 40F (4C), Trump\u2019s supporters were upbeat and optimistic, but many also said they were expecting unrest in the wake of the election. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be violence either way,\u201d whether Trump or Biden wins, said Angela Young, 43. As a gun owner from a small town in Michigan, she said, she was not worried about her personal safety. But the prospect of election-related violence in the United States was \u201cstraight-up unacceptable\u201d. It was less than a month after prosecutors foiled a rightwing plot to kidnap the Democratic governor of Michigan and put her on trial for treason, but rally attendees were more focused on the risk of renewed protests from the left in response to a Trump victory. \u201cLock her up!\u201d the Grand Rapids crowd chanted early in the night, at a mention of Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s name. A 78-year-old woman, who declined to give her name, said it was her very first Trump rally. She came with her 48-year-old daughter, both from Byron Center, Michigan, and said they were both \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s victory but anxious about violence from \u201cthe other side\u201d if he should win. Other Trump supporters echoed the concerns about what might happen after the election. \u201cIf Trump wins, you know they\u2019re going to be in the streets, rioting,\u201d a 57-year-old man said. He was from an area north of Flint, Michigan, which had not seen a lot of unrest during the protests over the summer. He also declined to give his name. \u201cI\u2019d hate to think there\u2019d be violence and rioting from anyone on our side, but I can see it happening,\u201d the man added. Trump supporters were frustrated at the constant attacks on the president, but they had been \u201crestrained\u201d and \u201csitting back\u201d for a long time, the man said. \u201cIt\u2019s been boiling for four years,\u201d he said. One seat over on the risers, Mark, 19, from Downriver, Michigan, was more optimistic. If Trump won, he said, he could imagine people with Trump signs in front of their houses getting their cars vandalized, but, he hoped, the \u201cdisruption out of the left\u201d would be nothing much worse than that. A group of men behind him in line for the Trump rally had been discussing the same thing, the 19-year-old said, with one man saying that he was afraid to put a Trump sign in his yard because he might be targeted. An hour away, in Lansing, one of Michigan\u2019s black state Democratic representatives had been preparing for an election day spent monitoring the polls in black neighborhoods for voter intimidation. There are fears of men with guns showing up at the polls, after a Michigan court overruled the secretary of state from banning open carrying of firearms at polling places. \u201cThere is a little anxiety in our community over whether people are going to be able to vote safely,\u201d state representative Sarah Anthony said in an interview on Monday afternoon. Some people were also concerned that if Trump lost the election, there could be renewed armed rightwing protests at Michigan\u2019s capitol, such as the demonstrations against the coronavirus lockdowns this spring, Anthony said. \u201cAs a leader, you know, you don\u2019t want to fuel these kinds of theories and rumors and things, you want to create a sense of calm. But what we\u2019ve learned from 2020 is that everything needs to be considered.\u201d More than 2.6 million Michigan voters have turned in their absentee ballots by Sunday evening. Trump\u2019s rally echoed the end to his campaign in 2016, which he also closed in Grand Rapids. \u201cYou better get out and vote tomorrow,\u201d Trump warned the crowd just before 1am. \u201cI\u2019ll be so angry, I\u2019ll never come back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
