Trump, the game's rising star and the UK champion, raced into a 4-0 lead at the mid-session interval in the best-of-11 match. Although O'Sullivan improved after the resumption \u2013 amassing a tournament-best break of 141 \u2013 Trump picked up the frames required for a 6-2 victory. The four-times champion O'Sullivan failed to live up to the promise of a first-round win over the reigning champion, Ding Junhui, but the rise of Trump continues and he will play Neil Robertson or Mark Williams in the final four. \"I've come into it full of confidence and thinking I can win it, and the players are more under pressure playing me now than I am playing them, and they all really want to beat me now,\" Trump said. PA Boxing Audley Harrison is set to make a comeback in April. Harrison, 40, has not entered the ring since his feeble showing against then WBA heavyweight champion David Haye in November 2010 but is now set to face Ali Adams in a fight nominally for the International Masters heavyweight title at the Brentwood Centre in Essex on 14 April. Harrison said: \"I've never been more disappointed in myself as I felt that night [against Haye] \u2026 Anyone can lose, but I didn't lose with dignity, so I was never going to retire on that performance.\" Baghdad-born Adams, 30, who won the Masters title by beating Vjekoslav Bajic at the York Hall in Bethnal Green last month, has a record of 13 wins from his 17 fights, with five victories coming by knockout. PA Olympic Games London 2012 organisers have defended their ticketing process and vowed that the recent problems will not be repeated when the final batch of more than 1m tickets goes on sale from April. An opportunity for successful applicants to sell back tickets they could no longer use was derailed when the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games was forced to close the site, operated by partner Ticketmaster, within hours. It reopened more than a week later, but prospective purchasers of the tickets will now have to wait until April. Paul Deighton, the chief executive of Locog, said he was disappointed the system did not stand up but promised the mistakes would be learned from for the final phase of sales.
