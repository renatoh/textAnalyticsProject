The selection, who won this event in 2011 and was only denied by the narrowest of margins last year, returns in top form having won the Palace House Stakes in good style this month. Five furlongs on fast ground is ideal and he should get a good tow from Tangerine Trees in the next-door stall. Swiss Spirit is an obvious danger dropped back to the minimum trip having travelled well over six furlongs last time but Reckless Abandon needs to prove he has trained on. 1.50 York Nothing makes a great deal of appeal and a chance is taken on the unexposed Spiritual Star, who has been highly tried and is clearly capable having been persevered with after only one disappointing run in the Greenham Stakes last season. 2.05 Goodwood Luca Cumani is unlikely to have Afsare fully primed with more prestigious prizes on the colt's radar this campaign but his record in this grade makes him a firm choice. 2.20 York Godolphin will be anxious to keep up the recent good work on the track and Songcraft, who will appreciate any more rain that falls and has a good record after a break, is the form pick. 2.40 Haydock A race likely to throw up a number of winners with Red Runaway, who beat today's opponent Van Percy despite not getting the run of the race at Chester, earning a narrow vote. 2.55 York The ground is very difficult to predict at York these days but provided it has not deteriorated significantly, Duke Of Firenze is fancied to follow up his cosy Goodwood success. 3.15 Haydock The form of Baltic Knight's Newbury victory last month has worked out well but he may have to give best this time to runner-up Here Comes When, who has subsequently won with a deal to spare at Chester. 3.20 Curragh Aidan O'Brien had a traditionally strong hand here and Magician, who is now his favoured runner, impressed with the turn of foot he displayed at Chester in the Dee Stakes. 3.35 Goodwood Easing of the ground has resulted in Breton Rock being routed here instead of Haydock and that looks sensible following a highly encouraging return behind Here Comes When."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
