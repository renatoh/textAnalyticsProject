One day after the emergence of Haji-Ioannou's letter to easyJet chairman Sir Michael Rake, which revealed plans to start-up an airline called Fastjet, UK intellectual property lawyers Keltie filed a trademark application for the new name covering \"transport services [and] airline services\". The request was lodged with the Office for Harmonisation for the Internal Market (OHIM), which deals with trademark applications for the EU. The Keltie move came on the same day that a company called Fast Jet was registered with Companies House. Documents show it has one shareholder, whom the entrepreneur denies knowing. Haji-Ioannou said: \"Keltie were obviously acting for some opportunist and have now withdrawn their application. Equally our lawyers are writing to [the shareholder]. Company names do not matter and we have applied for a trademark already.\" Haji-Ioannou declined to answer further questions about his plans. However, he added: \"The [announcement] issued by the directors of easyJet on Monday was clearly in breach of the clause of the comfort letter which calls for seven days of confidential discussions on new issues. They are now acting as if the comfort letter is terminated, so I will keep all my options open.\" EasyJet denied that the comfort letter had been terminated. Keltie would not comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
