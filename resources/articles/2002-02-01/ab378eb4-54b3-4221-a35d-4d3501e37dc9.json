The computer age is relatively new, but campaigners are concerned that we risk losing our digital heritage and creating an information dark age for future generations. 2. The ancient Egyptians believed that writing was invented by the god Thoth, the great measurer, and called their hieroglyphic script \"mdw-ntr\" (god's words). 3. There is some debate as to the origins of the earliest known writing. Sumerian script, from Mesopotamia,, can be dated to around 3200BC, but in 1999 clay tablets with script like markings were found in Pakistan and carbon dated to around 3300BC. 4. However some scholars believe that Vinca symbols from south-east Europe predate these by thousands of years. 5. Passing millennia have proved clay and papyrus to be very durable media. But today's electronic formats are shorter lived, with the average web page having a life span of only four weeks. 6. \"What hath God wrought?\" - words from the world's first telegraph, sent in 1844 by Samuel Morse, are preserved on paper and online. In 1876, Graham Bell's first ever telephone call, \"Mr Watson, come here, I want to see you,\" was also recorded. The world's first email, sent 31 years ago, has been lost. 7. Videotape has an estimated shelf life of only 15 years and betamax tapes from the 80s are now often unwatchable. 8. Technology becomes obsolete very quickly. The rate of change in computing means that information can be rendered inaccessible within a decade. 9. In 1993 there were just over a million web domains, there are now more than 150m. Only a tiny fraction of these archive their material - the BBC has only recently started to do so. 10. Many governments, universities and institutions now publish exclusively in electronic form. Without these data, tracing disease demographics, population trends and cultural fluctuations may become impossible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
