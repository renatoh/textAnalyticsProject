S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, a dot in the Gulf of Guinea, is a place of friendly fishermen, small bush farmers, clean sand and cheap rum. Sooner or later, the tourism industry will get around to it but not yet. Until then, there's a real sense of discovery. My only previous visit was 13 years ago, and at first sight little appears to have changed. The dolphins are still there, in shoals numbering hundreds, and a couple of small dive and snorkel companies will take you to see them, far offshore. With luck, you might also see the humpback whales that pass the island on their annual migrations. The dolphins are friendly enough to play in the bow wave of your dive boat, but cut your engines and they immediately vanish, to surface well out of harpoon range. Slip on a mask and snorkel and drop into clear, bottomless, blood-temperature water and you can float in an endless blue glow, listening to their chirps and squawks in the distance. Some things have changed, however. A couple of new and relatively modest hotels have sprouted. Most of all, they have cracked the first, and most basic lesson of tourism development: the beer and the shower should never be at the same temperature. The derelict Lockheed Constellations - relics of the Biafra war of the 1960s when S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 was a staging post for aid agencies, gunrunners and dogs of war - still sit in the long grass at the end of the airport runway. One of them bearing, mysteriously, the slogan \"Explore Canada's Arctic\" on its sunbaked hull has just been reincarnated as a bar and disco by an enterprising S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an named Jo\u00e3o, with coffee tables in the shade of its giant wings and dancing inside its gutted hull. Such enterprise would have been unlikely 13 years ago, but now S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 seems to have a spring in its step, as if finally recovering from centuries of Portuguese colonial oppression and more than a decade of post-colonial stagnation. In S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 town - a somnolent little capital with wide avenues and pastel-coloured colonial buildings surrounding a candy-pink presidential palace, the derelict colonial-era yacht club with its art-deco portholes and open-air pool is being renovated by an Angolan tour company. The four-star Miramar Hotel has a new Olympic-sized pool surrounded by tropical gar dens and a pavement cafe where the expats gather. Satellite TV has arrived, as has the internet, though access at the only cybercafe, the Club Tropicana, is glacially slow. Once you've seen the 16th-century cathedral and the National Museum - a clutter of moth-eaten colonial antiquities housed in the 400-year-old Fort S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o - and eaten fresh-caught, fresh-grilled mackerel at one of the beach shacks next to the incongruously modernistic Church of S\u00e3o Pedro, where the fishing boats land their catch, you've done S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 town. And the hinterland beckons. Straddling the equator, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is a dead volcano with thickly forested slopes rising to a central summit, the 2,024m Pico de S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9. Bare basalt plugs, locally called c\u00e3os (dogs) for no reason that I was able to fathom, rise from the canopy. They look like miniature versions of the plateau in Conan Doyle's The Lost World. The forest drips and steams, unseen things squawk and flutter in the trees, huge butterflies float across paths and tiny frogs meep in the streams. And the forest covers three-quarters of the island's 964 square kilometres, despite more than five centuries of human settlement. Much of it is virgin bush, and a look at the map shows why so much has been left untouched. The contours are packed close, with steep gorges and cliffs of sheer black basalt rising out of the treeline. The Portuguese, who discovered the then-uninhabited island in 1485, brought African slaves to cultivate sugar, coffee and cocoa on the fertile lower slopes and left the inaccessible highlands pretty much alone. After independence, many of the big Portuguese estates, called ro\u00e7as, were more or less abandoned, with their former workers growing patches of cassava and bananas around the crumbling plantation houses. M ost visitors come to explore S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's forest trails and their unique and flourishing birdlife - several dozen endemic species are found nowhere else. Some of the remote plantations have been pressed into service as accommodation by S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's fledgling tourism industry. One of these is Bombaim, a ramshackle wooden mansion with shaky balconies and floors made of huge teak planks. We reached it after a day's walking over high forested slopes, along mule tracks where clouds of butterflies hovered in clearings and tiny brown frogs no bigger than my thumbnail spawned in rain puddles, laying eggs no bigger than this full stop. In the dripping woods, we passed stone walls almost buried in bright green moss, abandoned stretches of cobbled highway, even rusting lengths of narrow-gauge railway, all being swallowed up by vegetation. They looked as ancient as Mayan ziggurats. For S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9ans, the forest is a herbal pharmacopoeia, although according to Luis, our guide, a disproportionate number of plants are aphrodisiacs of one sort or another. Hospitality at Bombaim is uncomplicated. We ate a huge meal of fish and chicken and drank good Portuguese red in a once gracious colonial dining room before sleeping, three to a room, on lumpy mattresses on the floor. The second day's walking was tougher, through thicker forest, and around midday began the heaviest downpour I have ever experienced. It turned the trail into a knee-deep torrent through which we waded and squelched to S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, another ramshackle manor above the fishing village of Angolares. The latter was a clutter of wooden stilt-houses where dogs, pigs and chickens wander, and where, later, I was rebuked by the village policeman for walking through the village without a shirt on. In a community where most people's clothes were more hole than cloth, I felt that exhibited a touching sense of propriety. The beach at Angolares is no great shakes, backed as it is by a murky mangrove stream. But the beaches of Ilheu das Rolas, the tiny islet that hangs off S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's southern tip, are the country's best. Many S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an fishermen still rely on flimsy sails made of sugar sacks to propel their wooden pirogues, but some make enough to fit an outboard motor, and it was one of these who took us to the Rolas Island Resort and a welcome dose of four-star luxury. A pre-dinner stroll round the island - crossing the equator both ways - takes about 45 minutes, passing a chain of sandy coves. There's a pool, too, from which you can look back to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and the pinnacle of C\u00e3o Grande. Walk across that lot? You'd have to be barmy. Rags to riches by John Vidal, environment editor S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 &amp; Principe is one of the poorest and most indebted countries in the world, with 70% of its income coming from aid, average income \u00a3165 a year, just 47 doctors and only one in seven children going on to secondary school. But all that will change from next year when it receives a $100m down payment - twice its annual income - on the first deals it has struck on a gargantuan oil find. Up to 12bn barrels of oil have been found offshore, and the US oil companies, led by Exxon, are moving in. The Americans want to build a major deep-water port to allow it to police its West African oil interests, and the country is expected to become one of the world's major oil exporters within a decade. Corruption aside, it is conceivable that S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 &amp; Principe could become, per capita, the richest country in Africa. But this is unlikely. The place is already in political turmoil with people jostling for position ahead of the oil, and corruption has reportedly reached a new high. Since the oil find, there has been a temporary bloodless coup. 'When there is a smell of oil, minds get stirred up. It creates a mirage in people's heads,' former president Manuel Pinto da Costa said recently. 'If we do not know how to manage it, it will be hell here.'
