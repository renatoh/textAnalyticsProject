Not Milton Keynes, nor the paternalistic model villages of a Cadbury or Rowntree, but Letchworth, Welwyn and Hampstead Garden Suburb, small towns closely linked to the farmland around them. Letchworth, pioneer of good quality cheap housing, was the inspiration of the social reformer Ebenezer Howard in 1898, after he'd seen model settlements in the US. Lenin, visiting in 1907, allegedly found it \"bursting with socialism\". George Orwell agreed it was the new face of England. Like Letchworth, Hampstead Garden Suburb was founded to bring together \"all classes of society\", its generous cottages the antidote to neighbouring Willesden's rows of villas, a place whose design would promote helpful neighbourliness.
