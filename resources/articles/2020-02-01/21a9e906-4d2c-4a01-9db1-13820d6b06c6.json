Mohammed Zahir Khan, a shopkeeper from Sunderland, was sentenced to four years and six months in May 2018 for nine counts of sharing Islamist material and calling for \u201cdeath to shia\u201d Muslims. Investigators say he is due for automatic release on 28 February \u2013 at the mid-point of his sentence, allowing for time spend on remand \u2013 unless the government successfully changes the law to make the minimum time served two-thirds of the sentence levied at court. Khan initially denied the postings were his, but once police and prosecutors had demonstrated he was the author, he switched his plea to guilty, but said that he had been reckless and not set out to encourage terrorism, according to a summary of the case from the Crown Prosecution Service. Some of his tweets were in support of Isis. \u201cWelcome to the year of fear, IS will make this one the deadliest ever. Mr Kuffar [non-believers] prepare for real war,\u201d he wrote in January 2017. Another said \u201cdeath to shias \u2026 death to every single one of them\u201d. After a trial in May 2018, Khan, then aged 40, was found guilty of terrorist offences and encouraging religious hatred, and was sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court. At the time police said: \u201cKhan openly disseminated material over the internet that promoted terrorism and hatred of others.\u201d The emergency legislation comes following a terrorist attack in Streatham, south London on Sunday. Sudesh Amman, 20, was killed by police after he stabbed two people just days after being automatically released from prison for charges of disseminating terrorist material. A Whitehall official said the legislation would be introduced in the Commons on 11 February. As the government now has a stable majority, the legislation should pass all its stages in the Commons before MPs break for recess next Thursday. It will begin its passage through the House of Lords on 25 February and the government hopes to get royal assent two days later. The official said: \u201cThere are no terrorist offenders who are due to receive automatic release before that date. \u201cIf the legislation is passed by 27 February we can prevent the automatic release of any further terrorist suspects who might pose a threat to the public. This is emergency legislation which we believe is vital for protecting the public and we are sure the Lords will wish to carry out its scrutiny quickly.\u201d They added: \u201cWe cannot continue to be in a position where the state has no power to block the release of terrorists who continue to pose a threat to the public.\u201d As well as Zahir Khan, five more offenders on the same type of sentence are set to be freed in March, official sources said, slightly higher than estimates made earlier in the week by the Henry Jackson Society. The government said it was not aiming to retrospectively alter the sentence handed out by the court; this is a change to release arrangements that technically come under the administration of a sentence. \u201cIt would be our position you can change those without being considered to breach an offender\u2019s human rights,\u201d the official said. Diane Abbott, shadow home secretary, said Labour was awaiting the detail of the legislation but would be likely to support it, so long as the government \u201cconfine themselves to the way they administer the sentence\u201d rather than seeking to change them retrospectively. \u201cBringing in the parole board to scrutinise decisions about early release is a good idea,\u201d she added. However, Abbott said any attempt by the government to seek a derogation from the European convention on human rights (ECHR) would be a \u201cred line\u201d for Labour. Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson, said: \u201cRushing through knee-jerk legislation in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack, without the resource and plans to reduce reoffending on release, is not the way to prevent terrorism. \u201cIf the Conservatives plan to pass this new law in less than three weeks, it must publish it immediately so MPs can scrutinise it.\u201d There has been concern from legal experts that the government\u2019s proposals could clash with the ECHR. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, raised further questions over Britain\u2019s relationship with the ECHR. When asked what he made of the warnings, he said he had heard the arguments from those against the changes but that they should go ahead. Lawyers think prisoners could try to appeal against the proposed changes as the ECHR contains guidelines on retrospective changes to prison sentences. Hancock told Sky News: \u201cOften in government you get a point where you have to balance the rights of different people and in this case it\u2019s weighing up the rights of an individual who\u2019s committed terrorist offences and his right to leave prison early against the rights of people to walk around Streatham or anywhere in our country free from the threat of terrorism.\u201d The convention is enforced by the European court of human rights, an institution that is separate to the EU and to which Britain remains a member and is bound by its rules."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
