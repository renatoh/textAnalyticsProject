Instead, Giorgio Napolitano answered the call of duty by reluctantly agreeing to serve a second term and appointing a left-right coalition under Enrico Letta. It is quite a turnaround for a man who spent so long as a leader of a communist party which the CIA and the Italian political system were committed to marginalising. But Mr Napolitano has always been one of Europe's big political figures \u2013 he took time out from the crisis in Rome to record a tribute for London's Eric Hobsbawm memorial event last week \u2013 and it is not just his own country but Europe that is now in his debt for his statesmanship. Addressing fierce words to Italy's squabbling parties last week, Mr Napolitano sounded more than ever like the \"King Giorgio\" he is sometimes depicted as being \u2013 not least because of his courtly manners and resemblance to Italy's last king, Umberto II. \u2022 This article was amended on Monday 29 April 2013 to correct the standfirst, which had become garbled during the editing process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
