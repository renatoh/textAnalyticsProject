And the talented and diverse team which England will cheer on in their first World Cup game this morning represents something positive about the nation we have become. Here are 11 ordinary men who have prospered by applying their exceptional talents. Expected to be role models, they face the pressures of fame - and of excessive early wealth. Mainly, they acquit themselves professionally and modestly. There are always concerns that a small minority of English idiots could spoil the festival atmosphere. But most England fans in Japan and Korea will enjoy experiencing a new culture while cheering on their team on behalf of those of us watching television at home. Manager Sven-Goran Eriksson has shrugged off the John Bull chorus which decried the appointment of a Swede to transform England's prospects. The affection he retains across Sweden shows that attempts to conscript allegiance - as in Norman Tebbit's infamous cricket test - fail to capture the reality of overlapping identities. The political far Right, with its daft fantasy of an all-white nation, can't support the diverse team which represents the real England this morning. The rest of us should feel free once again to support Ireland, the fantastic Senegal and England too. We would like to predict another famous 5-1 triumph. But the first victory is already won: whatever the result, we can be proud of the part England will play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
