She is sitting in a candle-lit dining room of the private chateau of Veuve Clicquot in Reims, in the heart of the Champagne region. She is with some of the most successful businesswomen in Europe, and laid out before them is a banquet of characteristic French opulence. But she isn't entirely happy - in fact, she seems altogether bewildered by what is happening. 'I can't believe what's going on here,' she tells me. 'The whole thing is totally bizarre...' I follow her outside into the sultry darkness of a French summer garden. Earlier dinner had been interrupted by the appearance of three singers, each of whom had emerged unannounced from hidden doorways. They had the flamboyance and hauteur of opera singers, but their choice of performance was far more mundane - songs from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar and Phantom of the Opera, as well as 'As Time Goes By' from Casablanca. It's fair to say that they did not always remember the words of the songs they were singing. Or, at least, they were masters of mispronunciation and of malapropism. 'Did you hear?' Cassani says. 'They kept getting the words wrong.' She delivers her own impromptu version of the song we have just heard: 'You must remember this/A kiss is just a kiss/a thigh is just a thigh...' She collapses into laughter. The next morning, Cassani and her husband, Guy Davis, rise early, before anyone else, to swim in the hotel pool. They are the definitive modern power couple: determined, hyper-successful and supremely fit. They are both in their early forties, but look younger. They would be absolutely intolerant, you sense, of any form of indolence or sloth. They certainly have little sympathy for the hangover from which many others, and I, are suffering after the hectic events of the night before. As the 2002 Veuve Clicquot businesswoman of the year, Cassani is a guest of honour in Reims. She is an American, Boston-born, but because she lives in Barnes, in London, and runs a British company, the low-cost airline Go, she has been chosen as the 'British' winner of the award. The other national winners are also in Reims, including the French producer of the hit film Am\u00e9lie, a motor-vehicle exhaust magnate from Austria and an \u00fcberhairdresser from Norway. As the women are led from one celebration to another, the champagne always flowing, proceedings at times begin to resemble a cross between It's a Knockout and The Eurovision Song Contest, with Count Eduard de Nazelle, the urbane, bald-headed host from Clicquot, in the role of Stuart Hall, chuckling animatedly as 'Miss Switzerland' waits to do her turn. I watch Cassani watching from the sidelines, monitoring what happens around her with amused reserve. She is used to having a relentless schedule, she tells me, and the drifting informality, not to mention the constant fine dining, is not entirely to her taste. 'Wouldn't you prefer just to go get a simple pizza,' she whispered the next evening as we were waiting to be led into another celebratory dinner, this time at the Paris Ritz. Barbara Cassani deserves her honour. As the founder and chief executive of Go, her achievement is considerable and unquestioned. 'In less than four years she went from having a respectable management career in British Airways to running her own airline, which she built from nothing into a distinctive brand, perhaps the most popular of all the low-cost operators,' says Simon Calder, author of No Frills: The Truth Behind the Low-Cost Revolution in the Skies. In the process, she became the only woman in the world ever to run an airline, an airline that, at the end of July, will be sold against her wishes to the rival low-cost operator easyJet. The deal \u00ba \u00aa will liberate Cassani, who is 41 and the mother of two children aged seven and 10, from all financial constraint - she is personally expected to make between \u00a315m and \u00a316m. But her wealth will have been achieved at a cost - because Go will effectively disappear, as it is absorbed into easyJet. 'It will be extremely upsetting for Cassani to watch what she created being obliterated,' says Calder. 'It will be a real shock to her, a bereavement, like having one of your children die.' Cassani was reluctant to sell Go because its potential, she was sure, was boundless. Since leading a management buy out of the airline from British Airways, she has watched its value increase spectacularly from \u00a3110m to \u00a3374m - and in less than a year. She knows, too, that the future of aviation - certainly for most short-haul flights in Britain and perhaps too in much of the rest of Europe - lies with no-frills, low-cost operators. Her plan had been to float Go on the stock exchange, and to open a permanent base on the continent, from where she hoped to infiltrate and modernise the wider European market. She was not given the chance to make it happen. 'I feel as though my work wasn't done, which is very disappointing,' Cassani tells me on the afternoon we travelled together to Paris. 'They [3i, the venture capitalists who backed the management buyout from BA] could have made double the money they are making if only they'd been prepared to hang on for another year, which is so frustrating. I do feel that the company was sold from underneath me. And I do feel very let down. They were quite within their contractual rights to sell, but what irritates me is that they didn't do what they said they would - which was to give me at least three years in charge.' As for the brash easyJet style, she will only say: 'The whole orange thing speaks volumes about them. We may not be subtle at Go, but at least we're not orange.' In Reims, Cassani and her fellow award-winners were invited to talk about their experiences in business at an open forum. One woman spoke of her guilt at having to put her career before her family; another of the 'impossible choices' confronting the ambitious modern women. The phrase 'women can't have it all' was heard more than once. The discussion, though skillfully chaired, had a banal familiarity. It was like listening to something on Woman's Hour. I could sense Cassani was irritated. When her time came to speak, she was characteristically direct. 'Life goes in phases,' she said. 'Of course, when you start up a business you have no time for anything else. If you think you can spend time with the kids, you're sadly deluded. Business is about making choices and being happy with those choices. I feel a bit of a fraud being here in Reims, because being a woman is irrelevant to my success or failure. My advice is: forget about being a woman. Set goals for yourself that are harder than those of your colleagues and reach them.' Since adolescence, Cassani has never ceased setting herself goals, and she remains intolerant of the possibility of her own failure. She has little interest in feminism. What she is, rather, is a self-styled 'humanist': she has limitless faith in the scientific method, in reason and in progress. 'With honesty, integrity and straightforward thinking you can work through most problems in life,' she says. 'I'll be very happy to listen to someone's words, but I'll judge them by their actions. That's my philosophy of life - how I do business, how I choose my friends.' After attending Mount Holyoke College, a private liberal arts university in New England, she did a masters degree in international relations at Princeton. She had what she describes as 'the kind of Ivy League education that allowed me to do anything I wanted in life'. Her family background was comfortable, but far from wealthy - as a student she worked as a waitress to pursue her interest in horse riding and claims to have 'ignored' the elite rituals and networks of Princeton life, all those fraternities and cloistered dining clubs. Her professors at Princeton were, she says, intensely arrogant. 'They made us feel as if we should feel privileged to be taught by them. In fact, it should have been the other way round: they were privileged to have people like us to teach.' In retrospect, Princeton taught her one important lesson: the value of humility. 'When I was there, I specialised in Soviet foreign policy. This was the early- to mid-80s. You know what? During all my time there, not one person predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism. That was quite an eye opener - and should remind us all to have a little bit of humility at times. There wasn't a great deal of humility on show at Princeton.' After Princeton, where she met her British husband, who himself became a successful investment banker, Cassani worked as a management consultant for Coopers &amp; Lybrand. From there, she joined British Airways, where she was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former chief executive Bob Ayling who, from the beginning, was impressed by her tenacity and candour: 'She always struck me as someone who stood out from others because she's got courage, personal courage. She doesn't say things because they are the party line, she says them because she believes them.' In 1997, Ayling was looking for someone within the organisation to establish a low-cost alternative to easyJet, Ryanair and the now defunct Debonair. He turned to Cassani, who was becoming restless for enhanced responsibility and a greater entrepreneurial challenge. 'I was completely startled at the time, but very excited,' she says now. 'It meant a complete change in our lifestyle, as we were living in New York. But the opportunity was too good to miss.' Cassani and her team were given \u00a325m by BA with which to write a business plan and to launch the new airline. No more money would be forthcoming - Go would stand or fall on the decisions taken by Cassani. 'When we started we had no idea how hard it would be,' she recalls. 'But my na\u00efvety gave me the energy to go for it. We all thought: \"We are intelligent people. We work hard. We're organised. We've got 25 million. We're probably a bit arrogant. But we can do it. So we were already in the middle of this thing when we suddenly thought: holy cow, this is huge! This is crazy! This is enormous!' In the spring of 2000, Rod Eddington took over as chief executive of the embattled, cash-straitened BA and decided almost immediately to sell off Go. Cassani seized her chance for true independence. Supported by 3i, she raised the necessary \u00a3110m to lead a management buyout, 'rolling', as she puts it, \u00a31m of her own money into the venture - which gave her four per cent of the business. 'I think 3i liked the idea that I'd poured my life savings into Go. It meant that I was on the hook, that I was committed.' In person, Cassani can at first appear circumspect and severe. She surveys you with suspicion, perhaps even with distrust. I noticed how that, before entering a room or clambering on to a bus with her fellow businesswomen, she would put on her Oakley shades, a form of evasion perhaps. Once she began to relax, however, her whole demeanour softened. She was witty, tactile and irreverent. She was good company. She speaks in a kind of wised-up demotic, combining more formal English with a loose, springy vernacular - things are 'cool', they are 'kind of spooky' or they are 'just, like, kind of crazy'. Her words are often studded with verbal italics, and she likes to describe herself as 'a loud-mouth American'. It's true that she can be loud - especially when recounting her early adventures at Go, when her competitors longed for her to fail - but mostly she is calm and measured. Yet she can also be charmingly guileless, such as when disquisitioning on how, when abroad, she is surprised to hear dogs responding to commands in languages other than English; or when she mentions that she would love to play quidditch, or at least one day fly through the air on a broomstick; or when advising me never to pay more than \u00a3100 for a pair of sunglasses - 'after that, it's just fashion'. Talking to Cassani one senses how much strain she and her family have felt in recent months. On the flight out from London, she sat apart from her husband, and spent the entire time reading newspapers. 'It's the first time in ages that I've had a chance just to relax and read the papers without worrying whether news of the easyJet deal would leak out,' she told me later. After the main dinner in Reims, when we had all been so entertained by the absurdity of the singers, Cassani said of her husband: 'I haven't heard him laugh like that for a long, long time, which is kind of sad.' Next time - and she has no doubt that there will be a next time for her in business - Cassani said she would be 'more honest' with her family. 'My poor husband and children have had to watch me working really manic hours. But I know they're proud of what we achieved at Go. After all, how many other children can say that their mother runs an airline! Periodically, my children will say: \"Mum, we really like it when you pick us up from school. We wish you would do it more often.\" My response is: \"Well, I can't run Go and pick you up from school. Which would you rather me do?\"' Cassani checks herself, perhaps conscious of sounding too callous, which she is not. 'It's probably unfair to ask children those kinds of questions,' she says. 'But every family runs to a different rhythm. Our family has always worked with me and my husband working. It's been all right for us. I don't feel as if I've ever made the wrong trade-offs. I've always been the kind of person who has 12 things on the go at the same time. That's the way I am. As my mother says to me: \"Even when you're relaxed, you're exhausting to be around.\"' What will Barbara Cassani do next? She's not as tough as she may appear to those who do not really know her - this is a woman who, after all, weeps occasionally when reading the Harry Potter books to her children. There's little doubt that she's been wounded by what happened at Go, though her fabulous windfall must soften any disappointment. Yet it is impossible to think of her remaining idle for long - she is too ambitious, too restless, and too intellectually curious. 'Barbara is a formidable woman,' says Calder. 'She's a leader with a phenomenal capacity for hard work and for inspiring loyalty among those who have worked for her. She'll be back.' Before parting from Cassani, I asked her what she would do with her money. 'The first thing I'll do is pay a lot of taxes. Then I'll put some of it in low-interest, but safe, investments and perhaps some into the stock market. But most of it, I'll use as seed capital for another business.' So she would risk it all? 'Yes, absolutely. I'm not the kind of person to buy yachts or lie on the beach for 10 years, not with my skin colour. And I'd rather invest in me than in someone I don't know. But whatever I'll do, whatever happens in the future, I'll never again allow a company I have built up to be sold from underneath me, as happened at Go.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
