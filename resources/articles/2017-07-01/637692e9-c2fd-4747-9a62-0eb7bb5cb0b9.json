Muthuraj Guruswamy said hackers trying to compromise Adani\u2019s jobs website were the latest hostile distraction, just as the company launched a $1.4m national advertising campaign alongside its overseas push to clinch funds to build Australia\u2019s largest coalmine. The four-month public relations drive began on Sunday with primetime national TV slots during Australian Ninja Warrior, and a four-page liftout in Fairfax\u2019s Sydney and Melbourne newspapers that highlighted jobs, rail sleeper and steel orders but avoided mention of the word coal. The \u201cThis is Adani\u201d campaign followed advice from a lobbying firm which is staffed by former strategists from both major political parties and helps targets of activism with \u201cissues management\u201d. The Guardian understands a former federal Liberal party advisor, Mark Hrycek, now working for Next Level Strategic Services, is overseeing the Adani campaign, which is produced by global advertising firm Starcom. Next Level\u2019s directors are Cameron Milner, a former Queensland Labor secretary and chief of staff to Bill Shorten during the 2016 election campaign, and David Moore, a one-time chief of staff to Howard government minister Mal Brough. Guruswamy, Adani\u2019s general manager of corporate affairs in Australia, said he \u201chad this thought in my head for some time now\u201d that the company\u2019s Indian roots were a factor in opposition to the Carmichael mine. \u201cAs a guy coming in as an Indian-born, naturalised Australian for the last 24 years, I\u2019ve gone through certain jobs and other areas [where] I felt sometimes like, \u2018Man, is it because I\u2019ve an Indian background I\u2019m not moving forward in my life?\u2019,\u201d he said. Some reactions to a recent report predicting Adani\u2019s opening of the Galilee would harm coal projects elsewhere in Australia prompted similar thoughts, Guruswamy said. \u201cI thought [critics] were talking about coal and climate change [but] you\u2019ve got Newcastle coal, you got some expansion of mines in the Surat Basin and the Bowen Basin, which are giving thermal coal and all of a sudden it\u2019s all OK. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thinking, hang on, is it because it\u2019s an Indian company?\u201d The day after Adani launched its pitch for public hearts and minds, IT staff reported that \u201cwe have people trying to hack into our system\u201d, Guruswamy said. \u201cWe know where it is coming from with the hackers, it\u2019s coming from this particular IP,\u201d Guruswamy said, declining to say if it was within Australia. The same day, in an unrelated leak, an environmental protest group, the Galilee Blockade, said it had been given details of the players behind Adani\u2019s advertising campaign. Galilee Blockade spokesman Ben Pennings said these showed \u201cthe revolving door between mainstream politics and the fossil fuel lobby is going so fast it could generate electricity itself\u201d. \u201cWe have a recent Liberal Party operative working for an ex-Labor Party big wig, trying to convince us a complete lemon is a sweet Bowen mango,\u201d Pennings, a former Greens candidate, said. \u201cNo wonder people take to the streets when both Queensland Labor and the federal Coalition happily meet with lobbyists they used to work with.\u201d Milner and Moore did not return calls, and an email request for comment from Hrycek did not receive a response. Guruswamy said when he first looked at the proposed Galilee mines as an \u201coutsider\u201d working at QR National during the mining boom, \u201cpeople were making fun of Clive Palmer with his Waratah coal, GVK had some issues [but] I don\u2019t think this [Adani] project was looked at as a controversy\u201d. \u201cWhy is this [now] a controversial project? I don\u2019t understand it at all.\u201d Guruswamy said the advertising campaign would \u201cgo everywhere\u201d, from supportive regional Queensland communities to southern capitals where many of its activist opponents are based. Adani\u2019s campaign marked \u201ca time to say to the world\u201d that jobs were flowing and finance would be clinched, despite the scepticism of some critics and longstanding opposition from environmentalists and some traditional owners, he said. Guruswamy said he took \u201csome consolation\u201d that politicians across the spectrum who \u201csupport us openly and take all the hits from their constituencies \u2013 or the GetUps or the ABCs or the Guardians of the world - would have done some due diligence\u201d on Adani and its ability to deliver the US$16bn project. The campaign came at a time when Adani considered its solar projects in Queensland a riskier investment than a $2b railway to open up the Galilee basin coalfields, he said. This was despite uncertainty about how much private finance Adani would gain for its railway, and therefore the amount of \u201cgap funding\u201d it would seek from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) to make up the difference, Guruswamy said. Pennings said Adani, which had reportedly applied for up to $900m in Naif funding for its railway, \u201cwill need to spend more than one and a half million to convince us they should get a cool billion of our taxes\u201d. But marketing and public relations experts said it was not green-leaning opponents but people on the street, along with \u201cbusiness influencers\u201d in Sydney and Melbourne, that were the targets of Adani\u2019s advertising. \u201cAt the end of the day, green groups, you\u2019re not going to change their minds, so really any kind of advertising is aimed at those who don\u2019t have a strong opinion,\u201d Margaret Lawson, who runs a Brisbane PR firm, said. \u201cThe general person in the street probably realises there\u2019s some opposition and different opinions but they may not be able to articulate the difference on issues and what the opposition has been around. \u201cIf the only impression in detail they have is from the ads, it\u2019ll be a positive one, [leading] the undecided to, even if not supporting the project, to not be openly opposed to it.\u201d Lawson said coal companies \u201cneed a social licence to operate, which is more than just your regulatory approvals and your funding agreements\u201d. \u201cUltimately their business objectives won\u2019t be achieved if there\u2019s widespread community opposition, and that\u2019s ongoing,\u201d she said. \u201cA social licence to operate is about having people know what you stand for and having an unimpeded channel to communicate your key messages, instead of getting them diluted in the debate on policy issues and regulation.\u201d Lawson said an example of this was the advertisements\u2019 reference to a total 10,000 \u201cdirect and indirect\u201d jobs, instead of the 1464 net average annual mine jobs modelled by Adani\u2019s own expert witness for the land court. Guruswamy said he had recently quipped to a senior government figure that he should be able to count paid roles stemming from the Stop Adani campaign as jobs generated by Adani. \u201cI see \u2018Stop Adani\u2019 signs everywhere \u2013 somebody\u2019s creating that sticker, somebody\u2019s manufacturing it, I want to know all those jobs and I want to put it as part of my indirect jobs created.\u201d Branding consultant Allan Bonsall said the general public would regard \u201cthe Adani brand as an Indian mining magnate that probably makes too much money for his own good\u201d. \u201cThey know there\u2019s a mine and vested interests involved, probably not a lot of positive vibes around it, but not necessarily negative,\u201d he said. Adani was trying to \u201cwin that emotional space just as much as winning the rational space\u201d in debate over the mine. \u201cAdani\u2019s no dummy, they know people are reacting from a point of view of renewables, coal is dirty etcetera,\u201d Bonsall said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that underpinning of the emotional reasons why Adani is a good corporate citizen, reinforcing its business credentials. \u201cClearly what they\u2019re wanting to do is reaffirm in everybody\u2019s head that idea that there\u2019s a positive side, and the fact they don\u2019t make any reference to coal shows they don\u2019t want to flag that as an immediate negative.\u201d Guruswamy said Adani considered its five-year pipeline of 1500MW in solar projects across Queensland to be \u201cmore risk [financially] than putting in 388km of railway line\u201d for a coal mine. \u201cThat\u2019s no joke.\u201d As no Australian governments had set renewable energy targets beyond 2030, banks were refusing to lend for large-scale solar projects that took longer to deliver a return, Guruswamy said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
