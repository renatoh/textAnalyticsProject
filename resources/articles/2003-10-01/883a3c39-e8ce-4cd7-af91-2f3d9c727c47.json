Friend, who began his journalism career aged 15 at the Kent &amp; Sussex Courier, will work his final Sky News shift between 8pm and midnight on Thursday, alongside Vivien Creegor. The 65-year-old has been one of Sky News' main news anchors since it launched in 1989 and even became a movie star briefly in the mid 90s, with cameo roles as a newscaster in Independence Day and Mission: Impossible. Friend, who is due to collect an MBE for services to broadcasting on October 29, said he would not be retiring completely and plans to continue writing and broadcasting after he leaves Sky News. \"It's been a great half century - local newspapers, BBC radio, foreign correspondent and then 14 years at Sky News. I'll miss the people and the buzz of seat-of-the-pants live broadcasting. But half a century in regular employment is probably enough,\" he said. \"Journalists never actually retire and after visiting some of the places I've worked in over the years, I'll settle down to some writing and, hopefully, more broadcasting,\" Friend said. Nick Pollard, the head of Sky News, led the industry tributes to Friend, describing him as a \"true gent - one of the old school of journalists\". \"With half a century of journalism his expertise and breadth of experience will be sorely missed,\" Pollard said. After his stint at the Kent &amp; Sussex Courier, based in Tunbridge Wells, he freelanced for the national newspapers for nine years, before joining the BBC in 1969 as a radio reporter. Friend spent four years reporting from Northern Ireland for BBC Radio 4's Today programme and also spent a short spell in Vietnam. He moved to Australia in 1973 to become the BBC's first correspondent there and four years later went to Tokyo for the corporation. Friend joined the BBC Breakfast Time bulletin for its launch in 1982 as the show's New York correspondent. Stephen Claypole, Friend's former boss as head of BBC newsgathering who went on to become managing director of news agency APTN, said he was \"one of the best reporters of his generation, utterly tenacious\". \"Then he became a presenter who had an unusual understanding of the audience - they always identified with him. \"He was an excellent broadcaster, with a tremendous voice and great on-screen charisma.\" The Channel 4 chief executive, Mark Thompson, who worked with Friend as a Breakfast Time producer, said: \"Bob is an exceptional journalist whose many years as an outstanding correspondent in the field gave him a natural authority as a Sky anchor.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
