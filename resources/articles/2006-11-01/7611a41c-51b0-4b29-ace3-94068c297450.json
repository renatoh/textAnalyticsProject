But David Geffen, America's 45th richest man (worth $4.5bn) and most compelling media mogul, never went to business school; he struck gold by moving the capital of rock'n'roll from New York to Los Angeles in the early Seventies. Now, after a flurry of selling - possibly to free up funds - he seems to be about to try and do the same with newspapers and in the process raise his already influential but enigmatic profile to a new level. His name was last week attached simultaneously to a remarkable sale and a potentially remarkable purchase: he sold what now becomes the world's most highly priced painting, Jackson Pollock's Number 5, to a Mexican financier for $140 million. And at almost the very moment the hammer hit the table at Sotheby's in New York, he finally threw down his gauntlet in the upcoming battle for ownership and control of the biggest newspaper on the opposite edge of America, the Los Angeles Times. The Pollock sale is the latest in a stream from Geffen's vaults. One of America's most renowned collector's of 20th-century masters, Geffen has been shedding his treasures of late: last month, he sold works by Jasper Johns and Wilhelm de Kooning for a combined sum of $143.5m. Before that, another Pollock, a Barnett Newman, an Andy Warhol and a Robert Rauschenberg went for a total of $80m. Maybe Geffen has just gone off painting. Or, more likely, he genuinely needs the money in preparation for another major move on America's media chessboard - not rock'n'roll or cinema this time, but newsprint. According to sources at the LA Times, Geffen has had his eyes on the title for at least a year; meeting the Tribune Group's chief executive as early as summer 2005 and harbouring plans to become not just the main man in Los Angeles, but a national newspaper baron. If successful, he will echo the genesis of his career, when he temporarily made Los Angeles the epicentre of rock'n'roll, stealing the focus from his native New York and simultaneously launching himself up Forbes's 'America's Richest' list. Essentially, Geffen journeyed from the acoustic cooings of Graham Nash and Joni Mitchell to the macho hard rock heroics of and Guns n' Roses and Aerosmith; stadium-packing, multi-million dollar businesses, before eventually moving on to an attempted revolution in Hollywood with Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Dreamworks. He was born in 1943, into a Jewish immigrant artisan family in Boro Park, Brooklyn, the son of a pattern-cutter who died when he was 17, after which his mother, Batya, opened a lingerie shop called Chic Corsetry by Geffen. A young and enterprising Geffen got his first job in the mailroom of the William Morris talent agency, fabricating a degree from Los Angeles, and was rewarded for initiative, rather than sanctioned, when caught steaming open letters. Being an usher on The Judy Garland Show and an assignment to manage the striking vocalist Laura Nyro marked his first employment in the music business. At 26, he joined the music entrepreneur Elliot Roberts, founded David Geffen Enterprises and signed up Crosby, Stills and Nash, bringing them under the wing of the founder of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, who was struck by Geffen's arrogance and grasp of the business. The deal signalled Geffen's move across America from the Big Apple to the leafy canyons of California. Barney Hoskyns's book Hotel California details that cocaine-fuelled era and the activities of an incestuous group of artists (including Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, Neil Young, Linda Ronstadt, Gram Parsons, the Eagles and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash) and ruthless businessmen (David Geffen and Elliot Roberts), who between them turned California into the centre of the pop universe. 'It was the greatest ride,' Geffen told Hoskyns. 'Artistically, financially, fulfilling dreams and aspirations. It was thrilling. The 1990s, which were considerably more successful for me, weren't nearly as magical.' By 1971, Geffen was a millionaire, lounging in his sauna with four men - Jackson Browne, Glenn Frey, Don Henley and Ned Doheny. His joke was that he never wanted his newly launched record company - Asylum - to record more artists than he could fit into his sauna ... which is fine when you've signed the Eagles. Their Greatest Hits remains the best-selling album ever released. But then, in 1977, Geffen was told he had cancer and had only four years to live. He reacted by leaving California for New York, to spend three years in the company of Calvin Klein, Ian Schrager and the Studio 54 crew, befriending John Lennon and, in the process, securing rights to his last album, Double Fantasy, released in November 1980 just before the former Beatle died. Geffen eventually learned that he didn't have - and never had had - cancer and returned west in 1980 to establish Geffen Records, scoring platinum after platinum - Aerosmith, Guns n' Roses, Whitesnake, Nirvana - along the way falling out with both Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, suing the latter for producing material below expectations. He has always been an intensely private man, but there doesn't appear to be a significant other in his life; he lives alone in the enormous mansion he bought from Jack Warner for $47.5m. Although gay, he did pause briefly to live with Cher. More recent and tantalising rumours that he had 'married' actor Keanu Reeves sadly turned out not to be true. These days, he slides in and out of the limelight displaying a healthy appetite for all manner of combat. In 2002, he sued songwriter Denise Rich (ex-wife of fugitive Marc Rich, infamously pardoned by Bill Clinton), because her leaky spa bath was damaging artwork and clothing in his Fifth Avenue Charles Gwathmey-designed apartment that Geffen lists at $20m. More recently and after a protracted legal battle, he was finally forced to allow the public access across his land to Malibu beach. But there have also been moments of heralded philanthropy: money for Aids research, $200m to his fictitious alma mater UCL, donations to Democratic Party candidates and lots of money for his friend Bill Clinton. His quiet, informal political clout and friendship with Clinton have intrigued commentators, but he remains tight-lipped, publicly commenting only that he thinks Hillary Clinton is unelectable. 'He's magnetic,' says biographer Tom King of the Wall Street Journal. King's book, The Operator (2000), which Geffen commissioned but from which he has now distanced himself, noted that: 'Some people found Geffen to be like an intoxicating drug. The high was indescribable, despite the fact that it would likely be followed by a wicked hangover.' In business, Geffen terrifies as much as he impresses. By the time he came to launch his most celebrated venture, he was a multi-billionaire. The story of the Dreamwork studio, launched after a huddle in a house on Pacific Palisades with Steven Spielberg and Disney refugee Jeffrey Katzenberg in 1994, has been oft-told ... how Dreamworks set out to bring a blend of quality and independence to the Hollywood on which Geffen had already turned his back; how the company made some of the most decorated films in recent cinema - Gladiator, American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan, Shrek - but failed to build the safety net needed to weather Hollywood's ups and downs. Last December, Dreamworks was sold to Viacom's Paramount Pictures. Although Dreamworks remains an active component of Paramount, its sale was a moment of mourning for those still clinging to the hope that independent freshwater fish could survive in the ocean of Hollywood. But in the impenetrable and obviously brilliant mind of David Geffen, perhaps this was the moment when the seed of impatience was planted whereby he might one day lose a Jackson Pollock, but gain a newspaper. Since 2000, the Los Angeles Times has come under the umbrella of the Tribune Group (owners of the Chicago Tribune), which is now in the process of breaking up its empire. The last six years have been an unhappy and commercially damaging time for the Times and three names are preparing to bid for the West Coast title: philanthropist Eli Broad, supermarket magnate Ron Burkle - and Geffen, the journalists' preferred candidate, because of his reportedly, and certainly typically, ambitious plans for the paper. For decades, America's newspaper landscape has been dominated by the 'Grey Lady', the New York Times, which rightly claims to being the nearest America has to a quality national. Geffen, however, never plays second fiddle and is reported to be willing to meet this challenge: to stare the Grey Lady in the eye and turn the LA Times into the other American national newspaper. Who would bet against him? The Geffen Lowdown Born: On 21 February 1943, in Boro Park, Brooklyn, the son of a pattern-cutter who died when he was 17. He credits his mother with giving him his work ethic. He dropped out of college to start work in the entertainment business. Best of times: Who knows? Was it being at the epicentre of the Los Angeles rock scene during the 1970s, surrounded by Janis, Joni, the Eagles et al, or was it making those $4.4 billion? Geffen himself suggests the former. Worst of times: Having to watch the Great Unwashed troop by his pool and through his rolling grounds to enjoy their legally obtained right of way across Geffen's private property in order to gain access to the beach at Malibu. What he says: (The Seventies in LA) 'was the greatest ride that one could possibly imagine. Artistically, financially, fulfilling dreams and aspirations. It was thrilling. The 1990s, which were considerably more successful for me, weren't nearly as magical.' What others say: 'Some people found Geffen to be like an intoxicating drug. The high was indescribable, despite the fact that it would likely be followed by a wicked hangover.' Tom King, biographer"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
