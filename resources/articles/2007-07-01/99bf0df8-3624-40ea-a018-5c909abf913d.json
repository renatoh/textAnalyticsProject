How I love that expression. It's the thought of Alexi Lalas tugging a cord to pull away a billowing chiffon sheet as David is revealed in all his uncomplicated and newly unshaven splendour. Who needs Gillette when you've got 125m greenbacks over five years? It will be the equivalent of Beckham's wee friend Tom Cruise being unveiled as the new male principal of the Driffield and District Gilbert and Sullivan Society. I have been racking my brains for the phrase that best describes Beckham's place in the American (forgive me) \"soccer\" firmament and more specifically the LA Galaxy (forgive me) galaxy. He will be . . . a diamond in a dungheap. Sapphire in silage ain't bad and pearl in a stinking, steaming pile of relative mediocrity is good but it's not right. D-I-D does it for me. When else has one player's talent been so massively, inversely proportional to the standard of the rest of the squad; when one man has been so head and shoulders, knees and toes, above anyone else that the ghastly football cliche \"different class\" is rendered pathetically inadequate? I put the problem out to tender. Some suggested Kenny Dalglish and Scotland. But that's different. Clearly Derek Parlane and Willie Pettigrew were not Ian Rush and there were times when King Kenny was on a different plane on the pitch and then the same one back home, but was it D-I-D syndrome? With Graeme Souness, Gordon Strachan and Davie Cooper around? I think not. Some suggested Matt Le Tissier. Again there is no comparison to Becks because I have always held to the theory that he craved that comfort zone. The fact that he never left Southampton for a big club was more about insecurity than loyalty. Apparently some attractive women of low self-esteem surround themselves with a gaggle of \"mingers\", to use the language of Channel 4. Beckham would love to be playing beautiful football in a gorgeous team but that pig-ugly wedge dictates otherwise. Mitch in Brum was adamant. \"Best, Moore and Marsh for Fulham in the 1970s.\" No, Mitch. Three gems they most certainly were but the diamond-geezer shtick was an out-and-out novelty act. They were the Marx Brothers, Marsho, Mooro and Wino, delighting us with their madcap patter. But this wasn't Duck Soup (1933). It was At The Circus (1939). \"Some good scenes but not a patch on their best years.\" Incidentally, Henrik Larsson and Harpo - are they by any chance related? Some other examples get closer to D-I-D syndrome. Jacki Dziekanowski at Bristol City 1992-93 is a good shout. As Eddie in Gloucester put it: \"Polish class amongst carthorses.\" But was the chasm gaping or just quite big? An email from Charles Connelly was persuasive. \"My team Charlton signed the former European footballer of the year Allan Simonsen from Barcelona in 1982. It was surreal - there he was, this football legend, trying to weave his magic alongside the likes of Terry Bullivant and big Les Berry in a crumbling stadium with about 4,000 diehards huddling together on the terraces watching this genius trying to create brilliant football in the bottom half of the old Second Division.\" The textbook case came to me when a Caledonian buddy was talking about one of his badminton shots. \"I lobbed him like Zoltan Varga,\" he bragged. While others nodded blankly, I got it. A player of phenomenal poise and vision, Varga was a Hungarian genius. He played in the 60s and 70s for Borussia Dortmund, Hertha Berlin and Ajax and today he would cost at least \u00a325m. In 1973, banned from German football for taking bribes to lose matches, he was exiled to Aberdeen for a season. A bit harsh, I know. Thirty-one unforgettable games later and presumably rehabilitated, he went to Amsterdam to replace Cruyff. Diamond in a dungheap? He was the Koh-i-Noor in a khazi of kick and rush. Different class? Different universe. For a Varga scenario to occur in a team sport like football it takes a unique set of circumstances. If you can think of any more let me know but I reckon you'll have to go a long way to better that one. Los Angeles maybe? London taps refresh parts other waters cannot reach I was worried about the Tour de France being in London given that the city's water supply is reputedly recycled. If you do live in the capital and have experienced a spring in your step or surge in your libido, now you know why. Those caught with a surfeit of testosterone in their pee have different ways of atoning. Take the Millars. Robert, our greatest touriste, has gone to the other extreme and, according to the Daily Mail, become a woman called Philippa, and David has also remoulded himself dramatically, but as an anti-drugs campaigner. David, who served a two-year ban, said that \"cycling is a complete mess at the moment\". Now you might argue that's like Don Rumsfeld saying \"Iraq is a complete mess at the moment\" but those in the know assure me David is the real deal. He's a rare thing - an athlete who, when rumbled, didn't deny it and now is genuinely and vitally engaged in the war to get drugs out of sport. A valuable member, you might say, of the coalition of the willing. How bad are things? Reluctant to get on my bike, I let my fingers do some crack investigative reporting and discovered that if you Google \"Tour de France\" and \"drugs\" you only get 590,000 results whereas \"Glastonbury\" and \"drugs\" or \"Pete Doherty\" and \"drugs\" yield 654,000 and 620,000 respectively. Could be worse. I spoke to John Scott, director of drug-free sport at UK Sport, and asked if any of the top riders were clean. His answer was extraordinary: \"I believe there are a number of the top riders who are clean.\" Is it possible to win the Tour clean? \"A very good question and I think that is the sort of question that you need to put to the athletes themselves. I think with the proper support, with the proper training, with the kind of medical excellence there is, it can be done.\" Has it been done in the last 10 years? \"Well, the evidence would clearly suggest that it hasn't.\" Centre Court 'jokers' raise the non-existent roof I attended the wonderful Wimbledon men's final on Sunday and you know those jesters you hear on the telly shouting between points and being rewarded with gales of laughter? Well, the king of comedy was five along from me and the master of mirth just round the corner. They must have left feeling like Richard Pryor after Live at the Apollo. The guy near me scored big with \"Rafa, I love you\" and \"Rafa, you're an animal\" while his rival raised the non-existent roof with \"Rafa, will you marry me?\" but his pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was, wait for it, \"Come on Tim\". People near me were practically wetting themselves at that one and excitedly repeating it to one another. I didn't want to embarrass my daughter but I seriously considered yelling \"Come on Eileen\". They'd have loved it. nicky.campbell@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
