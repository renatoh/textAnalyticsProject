Player and manager clashed in public last week when Tevez was taken off in the final minutes against Bolton. It is not known exactly what Tevez's plans are; he desperately misses his two daughters who are back home in Argentina, and returning to South America is one option, as is retirement, even though in an interview with City's club magazine published earlier this week, Tevez insisted he had no such intentions. There is also the deteriorating relationship with Mancini. The Italian may have made Tevez his captain at the start of the season but there is no particular bond between the pair. A short break in Argentina did little to silence rumours about the pair not seeing eye to eye . They exchanged angry words on the touchline at Bolton, with Tevez clearly annoyed at Mancini's decision to replace him with James Milner despite the fact he had scored the only goal. Subsequently, Tevez did not attend the players' Christmas party. If Tevez does leave, it will blow a considerable hole in City's Premier League title challenge. Although the striker missed yesterday's 3-1 win at West Ham \u2013 which left City joint top of the Premier League \u2013 because of suspension, he has been a hugely influential figure since his controversial move from Manchester United 18 months ago. His winner against Bolton was his 39th goal in 60 appearances for the club, emphasising just how much they rely on his output. As doubts remain over the maturity of the 20-year-old Mario Balotelli in the wake of the Italian's petulant reaction to being substituted for his own good at Upton Park, and Emmanuel Adebayor seemingly destined to leave in January after failing to make the bench yesterday, losing Tevez would be destabilising. It would also be unpopular among the City faithful, who have taken the 26-year-old to their hearts and would be distraught if Tevez were merely moving on to another club. It is uncertain whether that will be the case, although there are only a select few in Europe, including Chelsea, Read Madrid, Barcelona and Inter, who could afford the player if City were to demand the full market rate of at least \u00a330m. Tevez's controversial third-party ownership status \u2013 that caused West Ham so many problems when he arrived in England in 2005 \u2013 has now been scrapped, meaning City will not be prepared to accept a cut-price deal. They had hoped an offer of \u00a3250,000 a week would have soothed him, but it seems he is determined to leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
