In a statement on Wednesday, the UN said Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl had resigned with immediate effect his from role as commissioner general at the agency after an internal investigation found \u201cmanagement issues.\u201d Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl tendered his resignation to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday amid widespread coverage of the scandal just hours after he had agreed to step aside temporarily earlier in the day. Preliminary findings \u201cexclude fraud or misappropriation of operational funds\u201d by Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, a UN spokesman said separately. \u201cThere are, however, managerial issues that need to be addressed.\u201d The Swiss national has previously strongly denied allegations of impropriety. A leaked internal investigation into misconduct at UNRWA, completed late last year, accused the agency of \u201ccredible and corroborated\u201d allegations of serious ethical abuses, including some involving Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl. Announcing Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl was stepping aside, the UN secretary general\u2019s office said the continuing inquiry had \u201crevealed management issues which relate specifically\u201d to the agency\u2019s head. UNRWA said he had stepped aside until the completion of the process and the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, had appointed Christian Saunders as the officer in charge for the interim period. Sources said the allegations concerning Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl involved his relationship with a female member of staff, with whom he flew around the world travelling in business class and staying in boutique hotels. According to Swiss media reports earlier this year, Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, who is married, reportedly created a post for a woman with whom he was allegedly in a relationship. The cost of the role was funded by the Swiss foreign ministry from March 2015 to December last year. Several donor countries, including Switzerland and Belgium, suspended funding to UNRWA, which provides support to 5.5 million Palestinian refugees, over the allegations. The alleged misbehaviour at the top of the agency also reportedly involved other senior staff, with some of the complaints allegedly involving attempts to cover up other wrongdoing. The problems at the agency are believed to have come to light after two dozen senior staff complained to UNRWA\u2019s ethics officer, who completed a report on the allegations for Guterres in December last year. The report was leaked this summer, apparently at a time of frustration with the slow progress of the UN\u2019s investigation, prompting further revelations. Although Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl was regarded as a highly effective advocate for his agency \u2013 replacing the shortfall in US funds after Donald Trump cut them \u2013 the allegations suggest an organisation riven by discontent. The leaked investigation depicted an \u201cinner circle\u201d around Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl who were suggested to have benefited themselves. They were accused of \u201cengag[ing] in misconduct, nepotism, retaliation ... and other abuses of authority.\u201d The UNRWA statement said a continuing review by the UN internal oversight office found a number of areas that required strengthening. The apparent relationship at the heart of the allegations had prompted widespread speculation within the agency, as the two officials had flown around the world together, allegedly sometimes staying in a separate hotel to other staff. In a statement earlier this year regarding the claims, the agency\u2019s spokeswoman, Tamara Alrifai, said: \u201cThere is an ongoing investigation concerning UNRWA, and nothing that is being disseminated or discussed are findings of the investigation, only allegations and rumours.\u201d She appealed for people to \u201cwait for the actual conclusions\u201d and for donors to \u201ckeep their funding in place\u201d for Palestinian refugees. In early July, Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl said he \u201cunreservedly\u201d rejected the report\u2019s characterisation of the agency and its senior leadership. \u201cIf the current investigation \u2013 once it is completed \u2013 were to present findings that require corrective measures or other management actions, I will not and we will not hesitate to take them,\u201d he said. Israel expressed \u201cgreat concern\u201d over the findings, saying they confirmed the need for \u201cdeep and comprehensive change\u201d at UNRWA. \u201cThe stepping aside of Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl is but the first step in a long process that is needed to eliminate corruption, increase transparency and prevent politicisation of the agency,\u201d the foreign ministry said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
