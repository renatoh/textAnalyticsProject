One then mentioned Newcastle \u2013 referring to that afternoon in February 2011 when Arsenal contrived to surrender a 4-0 lead in the north-east, and the sense of dread grew. The panic increased after Rickie Lambert went close to reducing the deficit further with a close-range shot on 56 minutes but ultimately this was to be a satisfying match for the hosts, their fourth without defeat this season and the second in succession that has ended in victory. Eight points have been collected, eight goals scored, only one let in, and there is a growing sense that this may not be a bad season for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side after all. \"The vibes coming out are that we look like a real team and we enjoy to play together,\" said the Frenchman. \"That's a good basis and is interesting. \"We have a spirit, a desire to play together and the strength of depth. The vibes coming out, I feel them, the supporters feel them. You don't cheat that.\" Early days it may be but there is no doubt that the \"vibes\" Wenger is feeling are based on more than a hunch. His team look stronger defensively and, going forward, are playing with a collective intent that suggests Robin van Persie's departure has not had the damaging effect many predicted. In fact Arsenal are now threatening their opponents from more angles and avenues than before, with the new signings Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla excelling in Gunner red and white and Gervinho, a frustrating, peripheral figure last season, looking reborn. The Ivory Coast international scored twice against Southampton from a central-striker position once occupied by a gone and increasingly forgotten Dutchman. \"Van Persie scored 30 goals and, when you score 30 goals, everyone gives you the ball,\" Wenger added. \"Our game at the moment is a little bit more diversified but let's see how we deal with that in the big games. It will be important to see how we do against the bigger teams.\" They do not get much bigger than Manchester City, Arsenal's next league opponents next Sunday. That encounter will undeniably be the first significant test of Wenger's side post-Van Persie and whether or not they indeed have the credentials to challenge for the championship this season. Caution ahead of the visit to the Etihad Stadium is advisable, and not just because of the calibre of the opponents. For while the London club's start has been encouraging it is no guide to triumph. Arsenal obtained more points in their first four games in four of the eight seasons they have contested since last winning the title in 2004 and in that campaign they opened with four straight wins, an invincible start from a team which ultimately became invincible champions. \"We will know after 10 games,\" Wenger said when asked if his men could win the title this season. \"I think we have a chance.\" Before City comes Tuesday's trip to Montpellier for what is Arsenal's opening Champions League game. They travel to France in confident, content mood after this less than strenuous test, with Southampton having failed to offer the sort of challenge which saw them unnerve, and nearly beat, both City and Manchester United on their return to the Premier League. Nigel Adkins' side began here in a tentative, reckless fashion, with their defence, which has been the Saints' undoubted weakness so far this season, breeched early and often. They even contributed directly to their own suffering with Jos Hooiveld and Nathaniel Clyne scoring own-goals either side of strikes from Podolski and Gervinho in the first half. The visitors were more purposeful after the interval, thanks in part to the introduction of their \u00a311m signing Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez, but Arsenal were not to be denied, with Gervinho and Theo Walcott sealing the rout late on. \"It's been a tough start but it's given us that belief we are doing the right things,\" said the ever positive Adkins. \"We have learned a lot about peoples' character today.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
