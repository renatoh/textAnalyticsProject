It still had plenty of attractions when conducted by his replacement, Susanna Malkki, even if the young Finn couldn't quite match Volkov's incisive, penetrating direction. Perhaps he would have managed to make more of Orpheus, Stravinsky's little-performed ballet score from the 1940s. An enigmatic, self-contained work, it has all the distance of the composer's neoclassical style but little of its spiky rhythmic energy. Malkki brought an attractive warmth and fluidity to the score, underlining the romantic lushness you wouldn't normally associate with Stravinsky in this period, but at times it was difficult to discern an overall shape or sense of direction, particularly in the sections lacking in momentum. Though Orpheus was the concert's key work, tying in with the festival's Orpheus journey theme, it was never going to compete with the other work on the programme, Oedipus Rex, Stravinsky's macabre gift to the impresario Diaghilev. At times, it is difficult to know what to make of this so-called opera-oratorio, with its pompous narrator courtesy of Cocteau, its monumental anti-dramatic style and its mix of musical references from the 19th century. Malkki opted for creating one great kaleidoscope of colours and effects, revelling in the energy created by Stravinsky's continual juxtapositions. She was helped in this respect by a gutsy performance from the male voices of the Edinburgh Festival Chorus and the strong cast, led by Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts' powerful Oedipus and Natascha Petrinsky's impassioned Jocasta, who sang this music as if it were Verdi, bringing the lie to Stravinsky's alienating devices. The performance was underpinned by the BBCSSO, who responded to Malkki's clear, spare gestures with playing of high energy and precision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
