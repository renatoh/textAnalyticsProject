But his recent study of teachers' views suggest the government's attempt to curb bullying by stringent measures will get a lot of support from teachers. \"More serious incidents such as violence from pupils and threats from parents, were less frequent, but highly disturbing to teachers, who felt they were being blamed in a climate where parents were unprepared to take responsibility for their children,\" reported Dr Neill in research commissioned by the National Union of Teachers. In many cases these problems were due to a minority of children who absorbed a disproportionate amount of staff time and effort. Teachers were highly critical of the policies of inclusion for such children and felt they created a climate where no effective sanctions were available to deal with such problems. \"It is important that the measures proposed by the government for reducing this high-level disruption are adopted,\" he added. When it came to low-level harassment, classroom teachers said senior staff, outside authorities and parents were frequently unsupportive or hostile. Teachers commented that senior staff often gave poor support because of their preoccupation with bureaucracy and the need to maintain numbers in the school. There was also pressure from local authorities to avoid exclusions. Among the comments from teachers gathered by Dr Neill were: \u00b7 \"Though my school is in a lovely, rural area, the behaviour, particularly of some boys in year seven grows worse by the year. Rudeness, verbal abuse and a lack of interest and any effort at all are increasingly the norm.\" \u00b7 \"Malicious verbal threats and intimidation from past pupils, out on the streets, eg. stole my car and taunted me with 'What are you going to f****** do about it?'\" \u00b7 \"Children under five. On a weekly basis staff experience the need to restrain one child to prevent another child being injured. On a similar timescale members of staff experience being hit, kicked or pushed by angry or distressed children.\" \u00b7 \"I was headbutted by a five-year-old child and had my lip split open.\" \u00b7 \"Made-up blackmail attempt!\" \u00b7 \"We had a very damaging incident last year when two boys in year one were found to have been interfering sexually with other children.\" \u00b7 \"I'm quite big, so I'm not assaulted - I only get anonymous text messages on my mobile.\" A concern was the presence of children who could not cope with ordinary classroom life, sometimes due to inclusion policies. Even small numbers of such children could have a disproportionate effect: \u00b7 \"All the above incidents are from one pupil only who is a totally disruptive influence both emotionally and academically to the other children in my class...On one occasion both the parent and child were emotionally disruptive in the class and the head told me to go into the library with my class. This child seems inappropriately placed in a mainstream school.\" \u00b7 \"I have been kicked, punched, and bitten on a regular weekly basis by a pupil in my class who has severe emotional and behavioural problems.\" \u00b7 \"On one occasion, a child stabbed another with a pencil, producing a one inch gash (through a jumper + shirt). Child responsible was sent to headteacher to be sent back five minutes later. I refused to teach class until child was removed for the rest of the day. No further action was taken. Unfortunately the school received no support from county hall or governors. One of their performance management targets (suggested by County Hall) was no exclusions!\" In many cases respondents thought there had been little effective support or sympathy, again often because of maintaining enrolment or as a result of outside pressure, though there were reports of excellent support: \u00b7 \"It took three years to get the child who injured me statemented and a further year to get him into a special unit. \u00b7 \"I was scratched by a seven-year-old girl who drew blood - I contacted the union who contacted the headteacher. Her reply was 'What am I supposed to do about it?'\" \u00b7 \"There appears to be a reluctance to take up cases, particularly for supply, out of fear of backlash from parents or having to substantiate the case to parents who are invariably hostile.\" \u00b7 \"I have had to separate a fight (boy kicking another's head), students who defaecate in corridors, had a laser point shone in my eye by an 11-year-old boy. School makes it very awkward for staff to get hold of incident form because they then have to report it to the LEA.\" \u00b7 \"Reports are made to senior management team but nothing is done re the risk that child is causing, even when a pregnant teacher was hit in the stomach.\" \u00b7 \"Have received serious injury through the violent behaviour of student. Needed surgery and have been absent from post for six months.\" \u00b7 \"It's taken as read that being hit, bitten, scratched etc. are 'part of the job'. \" \u00b7 \"This is a part of my job. A few children react badly to:- routine, new environment, leaving mother, as they start nursery. I have been attacked by kicking, biting, scratching, my throat attacked. I feel this is 'animal instinct' and not the same violence as older children purposely do.\" In some cases the assault had been the last straw: \u00b7 \"As a result of an incident with a student last November when I was physically and verbally abused and then was unsupported by management I, with union help, took severance from the school in April.\" \u00b7 \"Next time I will contact the police myself as I don't feel we are able to do anything in education.\" \u00b7 \"I carry permanent scars from scratches, bites &amp; kicks including a broken nose. I have never received any kind of compensation but I understand that social services workers do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
