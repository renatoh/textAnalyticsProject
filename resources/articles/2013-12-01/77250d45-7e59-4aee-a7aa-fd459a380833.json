As they came to their perfectly-struck golf balls sitting mid-fairway like magical orbs, my mate Brian, relaxed from an afternoon\u2019s spectating in the Emirates marquee, assessed the scene and mused: \u201cI love Adam Scott.\u201d Brian, a man of East Maitland not normally given to such pronouncements, then added: \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t love him like a man loves a woman, or indeed a man. But I love everything about him. I love how he swings the club. I love how good he is. I love his goodness. \u201cI mean \u2026 imagine being him.\u201d Imagine that, indeed. Even without a second Australian Open and the fabled triple crown, Scott has been the best Australian golfer with a bullet shot from Goldfinger\u2019s gun. Everything (bar the approach shot on 18 yesterday, and the chip back onto the green, and the quintuple-bogey 9 at Royal Melbourne) he\u2019s touched has turned to gleaming gold bullion. He has built it and they have come. And he\u2019s turned 45-year-old coal miners from Maitland into simpering schoolgirls. Yet like his mentor and fellow Superman of golf, Greg Norman, Scott remains fallibly human. And when he left the door ajar for Rory McIlroy on 18 yesterday, the Ulsterman of La Mancha pounced like a mountain cougar on a chunk of osso bucco. His approach shot landed top tier and stayed, spin-less. Any friction and his putt would have been 40 feet up a swale instead of 12-feet inside right-edge. His putt to win the championship tipped into the hole like the last golden swallow of beer. So yes, top golf from a tip-top player, and McIlroy\u2019s 6-under 66 was a hot round, reining in Scott\u2019s four-shot lead like Sharky Norman hauling in a massive tuna onto the deck of his 500-foot fishing boat. He even left a couple out there. He is a worthy champion. Scott? Will be gutted like a catfish. Yet he can probably console himself. As Geoff Ogilvy said in the Emirates marquee after his round of 1-over (-2 for the championship) yesterday, even though you haven\u2019t played super golf, you are still playing golf. And people are paying you quite well to do it. And it is hard to be very angry. And as my man Brian would tell you, being Adam Scott appears to be quite good. Indeed it appears to be very good. After all the practice and travel and hotel check-ins, your life would appear to be: play preternatural golf; get adulated within an inch of your life; drive away in a flash car to a flash hotel to eat flash food with flash people before flash women attempt to squeeze their womanly bits between the closing glass doors of the elevator to your penthouse apartment with glittering Harbour views. How good has Scott been this year? He\u2019s number two in the world, friend, and targeting The Tiger. He won the Masters, you may have heard of it. He won $4.9 million on the US PGA Tour. Countless other millions modelling clobber. He has a home in Crans-Montana in Switzerland where his neighbours include Sergio Garcia, the Molinari brothers and Ali Bongo, a magician. At pristine Royal Sydney this week, until 18, Scott scorched the very earth with Australia\u2019s best golfers. He owned Royal Sydney, owned the field, owned the week. Owned Australia. Sure, it was a thin-enough field, and Scott and McIlroy were expected to fill the last two groups Saturday and Sunday. And they did. And the crowds flocked like addicts of golf porn. And the two men were well out there in terms of class in this 128-man field, even with former champions Ogilvy, John Senden and Aaron Baddeley. Scott\u2019s golf this year has entered the other-worldly. He\u2019s hitting it pure. When he misses putts they shave the holes like hot bikini wax. And there\u2019s nothing going on in his head but the rent and, occasionally, Big Stevie Williams, a giant-striding authority figure. And that, people, can be all an elite golfer needs to be \u2026 Number One. I was in Dubai a couple weeks ago watching Henrik Stenson smash the Best of Europe on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates. And there was a machine-like quality about the Swede\u2019s work. He thundered drives straight and long, missing but six fairways in 72 holes. He hit greens and stuck. On the rare occasion he missed a green \u2013 four times in 72 holes \u2013 he got up-and-down. He made putts. And he moved inexorably on, racking up stats like the Terminator knocking off Sarah Connors. Scott\u2019s golf is up there with that. In terms of class in Australia he\u2019s Pat Malone. He owns Australian golf at the moment. And though Jason Day came back well to finish 8-under and T6 here \u2013 and every Australian sports hound is hankering to see how he fares at Augusta - Scott is The One. Our Adam. Good bloke. Even top bloke. Top bloke? Consider: he\u2019s just stuffed up the last hole of 72, played across four long days, effectively giving away the tournament \u2013 the one every Aussie kid wants to win \u2013 and the dream of a clean-sweep of the Australian majors. He\u2019s just spent four hours \u201cholding off\u201d this preternaturally talented Irish wolfhound with every ounce of nous, skill, smarts, nerve and will. And that, folks, is draining stuff, as anyone who\u2019s done a very hard four-hour maths test while every few minutes playing a game of Whack-A-Mole in which every time you miss it costs you 10 thousand dollars would tell you. Yet there\u2019s our Adam at the presentation where he\u2019s got the grace and composure to congratulate McIlroy, and obviously mean it, and still throw in a friendly little jibe about the champion's thus far winless season. \u201cAbout time, mate,\u201d he said with a grin. To which Rory grinned. And we all grinned. Because while winners are grinners, copping a loss like that and still smiling about it, that\u2019s the mark of a top bloke. And there's no higher accolade in the Australian man-rating system. In describing Scott\u2019s work and the crowds that stood 10-deep to see him, Golf Australia CEO Stephen Pitt twice used the term \u201cphenomenal\u201d. You can excuse Pitt for waxing lyrical. Outside November, or Scott and Day contending in Majors, golf in Australia struggles for column inches. But invoking the ghost of the Great White Shark man and placing Scott in that rarefied air is still, even after this year, this month, and his ascension to world\u2019s-hottest-golfer-with-Henrik-Stenson-right-now, premature. Scott does not yet command the adulation of the charismatic, blonde-haired buccaneer. But it\u2019s in the post people.
