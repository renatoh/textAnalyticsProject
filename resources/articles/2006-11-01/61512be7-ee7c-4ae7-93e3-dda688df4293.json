In upholding a complaint of an unwarranted infringement of privacy of five and two-year-olds shown leaving the court after the sentencing of their grandmother (Maxine Carr's mother), Ofcom concluded that the children were innocent bystanders uninvolved in a story that centred on a particularly sensitive and high-profile criminal case (\"the Soham murders\"). In these particular circumstances, and in line with its statutory duty to protect \"the vulnerability of children\", Ofcom considered that there was a higher expectation of privacy for these children where the parents had not given informed consent. Consequently additional care was needed. In not upholding a complaint about published pictures of a 10-year-old and her father, the PCC recognised the context of the pictures which showed both the father and daughter making offensive gestures at a football match. The PCC concluded that they were at a significant sporting event, where their actions could have been viewed by a large number of people, and that they must have been aware of the possibility of being photographed. In these circumstances, the PCC found that it was not unreasonable to have expected the media to assume that the father was unconcerned by the publication of such pictures. Stephen Whittle registers his surprise at Ofcom's finding that a broadcaster's \"prime concern\" should be the vulnerability of children. He will, however, recognise that the phrase - and indeed the obligation against which Ofcom had to judge this particular case - comes from the code issued by the Broadcasting Standards Commission when he was its director. Chris Banatvala, director of standards, Ofcom M&amp;S ad works Naresh Ramchandani is utterly wrong about the M&amp;S campaign (The M&amp;S campaign is glamorous but no good, November 13). What was its problem? It was seen as dull, unstylish and remote. Glamorous advertising for \"Your M&amp;S\" surely addresses these issues. Whether or not the campaign is innovative is irrelevant. Indeed, the mainstream, familiar nature of the campaign probably helps M&amp;S belong again. Originality for its own sake is the curse of our business. Andrew Papworth, advertising &amp; marketing consultant, Billericay, Essex \u00b7 Naresh Ramchandani claims that M&amp;S advertising helped the firm achieve a corporate turnaround but that the advertising was not good. What other measure can there possibly ever have been in the whole cosmos of the quality of advertising other than for it to achieve commercial success? Mark Adams, Pembridge Partners LLP TES loses its mystique Your report on the revamped TES ignored the most momentous change that has taken place (Could do better, November 13). For decade after decade adventurous teachers would turn their hopes to the \"miscellaneous\" section of the jobs pages. That word always carried with it a special mystique. The new TES format has squandered this and replaced it with \"other classifications\". The bland barbarians are at the gate.
