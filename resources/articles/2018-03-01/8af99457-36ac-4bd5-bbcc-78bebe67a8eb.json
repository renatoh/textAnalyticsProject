Khazri was fortunate to escape with a yellow card after lashing out with a foot at Costa Rica\u2019s Kendall Waston as retaliation for a series of rugged tackles by the Central American team. He went on to score the only goal but Waston says England will have been pleased by confirmation that Khazri can be provoked into acts that could lead to his dismissal. \u201cI think in a World Cup match he would have got a red card for kicking out at me like he did,\u201d Waston said. \u201cIn a friendly game sometimes referees can leave it. People might look at that and think he could be wound up \u2013 and in football you have to take advantage of everything. \u201cWhen you know the type of player someone is, you try to do things that might make them crazy and see their team lose them with a red card. England will see what happened and they will try to take advantage of it.\u201d Khazri has been sent off for his country \u2013 against Mauritania in 2016 \u2013 for punching an opponent after a challenge he deemed overly rugged. As well as a short fuse, Khazri has skills that make him one of Tunisia\u2019s key players. His goal against Costa Rica crowned a fine personal performance as a central striker rather than in his customary wide role. Tunisia\u2019s manager, Nabil Ma\u00e2loul, tried him up front after seeing him do well in that position for Rennes, whom he joined last summer on loan from Sunderland. Yohan Benalouane, Leicester City\u2019s Tunisia defender, underlined the threat that Khazri could pose to England. \u201cHe is great for our team because he has lots of quality \u2013 he can shoot, he can dribble, he can make things happen. He will be an important player for us at the World Cup and very dangerous. England should be worried about him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
