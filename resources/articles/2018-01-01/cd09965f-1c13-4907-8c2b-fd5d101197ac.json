The manager is also struggling to add to his squad for the second half of the season. One reason is cost, another the quality of his existing players. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult but we always dream,\u201d Pochettino said. Tottenham are interested in Bordeaux\u2019s \u00a345m-rated winger Malcom but an attempt to get him in the summer appears more likely. Pochettino, who has earned a reputation for giving young players their chance, has loaned Carter-Vickers to Ipswich, having recalled him from Sheffield United, and sent Edwards to Norwich. \u201cWe have built a very strong squad and the demands are higher [for the academy players],\u201d said Pochettino. \u201cIf you were seven out of 10, you were going to have the possibility to play but now we have said to them they need to be an eight or an eight and a half.\u201d On Edwards Pochettino added: \u201cIt is a great opportunity for him at Norwich. He now has the possibility to be a man.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
