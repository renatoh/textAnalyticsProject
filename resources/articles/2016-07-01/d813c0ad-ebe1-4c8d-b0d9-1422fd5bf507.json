If you are a big charity, other awards are available and may we respectfully direct you to them. But if you are a registered charity with turnover of less than \u00a31.5m, these are for you. Smaller charities are too often overshadowed by the big names of the voluntary sector and receive a diminishing share of funding. Yet when it comes to innovation, flexibility and reach into communities, it\u2019s invariably the case that small is beautiful \u2013 and delivers results. The Guardian Charity Awards give smaller social welfare charities a unique platform to celebrate their success. For 24 years, we have showcased their work and given winners the backing and profile they need to move forward. Our entry criteria mean that the big names cannot exert their usual dominance. With each of our five winners receiving an unparalleled package of development support, as well as a cash prize, the awards offer a priceless leg-up to charities that offer practical solutions to people\u2019s problems. Last year\u2019s winners were: Action Foundation, which supports destitute asylum seekers on Tyneside, providing accommodation and running language classes. The Brilliant Club, which places PhD and research students in schools to work with pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds to help them gain places at top universities. Environmental and Management Solutions, which works to combat food and fuel poverty in the Hull area by helping people grow fruit and vegetables and by installing energy-saving technology. Hand on Heart, which raises awareness of sudden cardiac arrest among children and young people and has placed more than 800 defibrillators in schools and community settings. Working Chance, which helps women ex-offenders to gain employment and to break the cycle of disadvantage and crime. Your charity can be local or national. As long as its objective is improving social welfare in the UK in its broadest sense, and provided other entry criteria are met, nothing is ruled out. Will you rule yourself in?
