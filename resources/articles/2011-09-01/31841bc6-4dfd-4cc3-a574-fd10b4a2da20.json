It is 10 metres long with a mass of almost 6,000 kg, and it is about to fall the Earth somewhere between 57\u00b0 N and 57\u00b0 S of the equator, a huge swathe of the planet which includes the UK except N Scotland. Nasa estimates that less than 10% of UARS will survive its fiery plunge into the atmosphere and that some 26 chunks of debris will rain down over a \"footprint\" perhaps 800km long in the craft's orbital plane. The odds of anyone on Earth being struck by one of these pieces are put at one in 3,200. As I write, it seems most likely that UARS will \"decay\" on Friday, though this could be brought forward if there is a geomagnetic storm like the one that occurred last weekend. Such events heat up the atmosphere, increasing its density and the drag UARS feels. My calculations suggest that the average height of UARS will fall from 206 to 192 km today, Wednesday, and perhaps to 166 km by midnight on Thursday. Its reentry may occur a few hours later, but it is too soon to say just when and where. We cannot see UARS at present since it is in the Earth's shadow near our latitudes, unless, that is, we are lucky enough to witness its reentry fireball. The orbital plane crosses the UK during a 5-hour window that begins at about 22:20 BST on Thursday so that if decay occurs later than 03:20 on Friday, which I suspect it will, we are probably \"safe\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
