The three countries, which represent the EU in discussions with Tehran on its nuclear activities, have also discussed admitting Iran to membership of the World Trade Organisation in talks with Iranian officials, the Foreign Office said. The EU wants to persuade Iran to turn its temporary suspension of dual-use nuclear activities into a permanent halt. Tehran, however, says the freeze, agreed last year with the European trio, will be brief. Reports from America today suggest the Bush administration could be preparing to change its opposition to such a deal. The Washington Post reports today that President Bush, after meeting European leaders last week, is close to a decision to back the European proposal. \"The reason we're comfortable considering this tactically is because, strategically, when the president was in Europe, he found them solid on the big issue: that Iran can't have a nuclear weapon,\" a state department official told the paper. \"Having found them firm on the strategic issue, he's more willing to consider tactical aspects with the Europeans - including how do we work with them and what can the Europeans offer that we would be a part of.\" A decision to use incentives as well as tough talk and implied threats of military action would be a radical change of stance for the Bush administration. It has always maintained Iran deserved no reward for fulfilling its legal obligations in the non-proliferation treaty. America fears Iran could use its nuclear enrichment program to manufacture nuclear weapons. Iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful. The Foreign Office said European and Iranian officials had held a series of meetings, mostly in Geneva, in recent months. He said the diplomats were working out how the International Atomic Energy Agency would monitor Iran's compliance with its agreement to halt uranium enrichment activities, and what \"incentives\" Iran could expect in return. The Foreign Office said no firm decisions had been made but confirmed the talks had covered possible supplies of commercial aircraft and aircraft spare parts and WTO membership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
