Although Tyson has a chequered disciplinary history, which most notoriously includes a disqualification for biting Evander Holyfield's ear, Shields said he was confident Tyson would fight according to the rules. \"We are prepared and have had guys in there trying to frustrate Mike in sparring. He knows all about what may happen. We have talked it through and he understands. We say just fight. Mike Tyson will be there to fight properly.\" Asked whether he expected Lewis to foul in an attempt to provoke Tyson, Shields replied: \"Absolutely. But whether he holds or tries to pull Mike on to punches or hits around the back of the head, it will be up to the referee. I want to see the referee do his job and to see Lewis fight according to the rules.\" The possibility of Tyson himself answering questions was removed when the former champion walked out of a \"public\" workout after only briefly hitting a speedball for the benefit of the cameras. He had no word to the hundreds of waiting reporters. The only man for whom Tyson made an exception was Zeljko Mavrovic, the Croatian heavyweight who gave Lewis one of his most uncomfortable nights in September 1998 when Lewis outpointed him over 12 gruelling rounds. Mavrovic subsequently became desperately ill after contracting a debilitating virus and has never stepped into a ring since. \"You all right, brother?\" Tyson asked as he leaned over the barrier to hug the tall, gaunt figure, only recognisable because he still sports his trademark shaved head with a Mohican-style line of hair. Their embrace was warm. \"I'm OK,\" Mavrovic answered before telling Tyson: \"I am a journalist now.\" Tyson smiled, the flash of gold teeth visible as he turned away as if to say, \"So you joined the enemy too.\" \"You kind of irritate him,\" Shields told reporters after Tyson departed. The questions turned to whether or not Tyson was still taking the medication he was prescribed during his ban for the 1997 ear-biting incident. \"That's why Mike won't come out and talk to you,\" said Shields. \"Because you ask the craziest sort of questions. I mean, come on man, this is boxing. Things happen in the past. \"Does anybody ask Lennox why he holds people behind the head and hits people? Do you ask these kinds of questions? You don't mess with Lennox. Good questions for Lennox but, when it comes to Mike Tyson, you want to come out with all the bull.\" Arguably, he has a point. But comments by Tyson's co-trainer Stacey McKinley brought a shudder from the audience. When questioned as to what medication his fighter had been taking, McKinley snapped: \"You want to know that? You ask Mike to his face. I'd pick you out of the Mississippi River because you'd be one dead mother.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
