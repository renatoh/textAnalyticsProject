The county club have secured a \u00a39m loan from the council which will now allow them to complete their agreed \u00a312m purchase of the ground from the Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Company. Yorkshire were granted a 15-year international staging agreement by the England and Wales Cricket Board on the condition that they owned their own ground by the end of 2005. The council met yesterday to agree to the loan, which must be repaid over 15 years. \"The arrangement represents a victory for both the city and Yorkshire CCC,\" said the club chairman Robin Smith. \"The city's future and reputation will be enhanced by the continuity of Test and international cricket at Headingley.\" The decision means that for the first time in a 142-year history Yorkshire will own their ground. They will combine the \u00a39m they receive from the council with \u00a33m they intend to raise through a ground appeal, also over a 15-year period. Mark Harris, the deputy leader of the council, said the decision was taken in the best economic interests of the city. \"We have always been very conscious of the importance of Test match status to Leeds,\" he said. \"An independent study has shown that it would cost the city millions if Headingley lost its Test match status, not just in the present but in the future too. \"The cricket ground is one of the city's crown jewels and cricket one of its major sporting attractions. It is crucially important to the city's reputation and standing nationally and internationally. \"The public can be assured that the loan will be at nil cost to the taxpayers; both the interest and the capital sum will be fully repaid by the club.\" Yorkshire have financed considerable redevelopment at Headingley in recent years, despite not owning it, to keep it up to international standard. They currently have plans to further increase the capacity from its current 17,000 to 20,000 with work on the grandstand and at the Kirkstall Lane end. Meanwhile, New Zealand have dropped an experienced pair in Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan for the first two one-day internationals against Sri Lanka in the new year. Astle and McMillan have been short of runs in recent series and have been replaced by the uncapped James How, the Central Districts captain, and Peter Fulton from Canterbury. \"Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan have not been selected due to recent form,\" said John Bracewell, the New Zealand coach. \"We felt they should return to domestic cricket to work on their batting.\" Stephen Fleming, the New Zealand captain, and their outstanding fast bowler Shane Bond return after injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
