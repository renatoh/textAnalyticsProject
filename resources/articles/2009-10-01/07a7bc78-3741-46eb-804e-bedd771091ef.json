Taking advantage of the added numbers, the concert opened with Michael Tippett's spiky, incisive Concerto for Double String Orchestra and continued with Corale, Berio's expansion of his Violin Sequenza, in which the solo line is performed in the context of the dreamlike ensemble soundscape. It was a showcase for Gould's virtuosity, and a reminder that the ensemble hasn't been afraid to push the boundaries of contemporary repertoire alongside its core programming. Bach's Double Violin Concerto was likewise a reminder of their origins as the Scottish Baroque Ensemble. Performing tastes for early music have changed beyond recognition since violinist Leonard Friedman founded the ensemble four decades ago, but this performance, with current artistic director Jonathan Morton and Gould as soloists, perhaps took the dictates of performance practice to extremes. The pace, even in the slow movement, was extremely brisk, and the tone light enough to avoid much interpretation beyond a clean, clear articulation. The final work, Vaughan Williams's Fantasia On a Theme By Thomas Tallis \u2013 one composer looking back to the music of another \u2013 was perfectly in keeping with the evening's theme, and beautifully shaped, the second orchestra hidden in the gallery sounding like the echo of ghostly viol consort from Tallis's age."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
