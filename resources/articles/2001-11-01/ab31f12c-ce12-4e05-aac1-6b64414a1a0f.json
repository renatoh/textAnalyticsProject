Their tour of Wales, a tradition for nearly 100 years, may have been a victim of the new order but the Barbarians have replaced it with three matches against the home unions every May: England and Scotland each year, with Wales and Ireland alternating. Rejected by some as an anachronism in a modern game that demands absolute dedication and provides employment to nutritionists and psychologists, the Barbarians continue to buck the trend and tonight in Cardiff, where they face Australia, they expect to provide further evidence with which to silence their critics. The Baa-Baas have already been enjoying themselves, spending Monday evening having a few beers together rather than stuck in their hotel watching rugby videos. \"The Barbarians still have an important part to play in the game,\" said their captain tonight, Rob Howley. \"It is all about quality rugby with the pressure off and the chance to properly get to know players from other countries.\" Howley's defiance was echoed by Bob Dwyer, the side's coach for tonight's end-of-tour showpiece against the world champions at the Millennium stadium. \"I think the Barbarians are more important to the game than ever before,\" Dwyer said. \"They are a bridge between the past and the present, a reminder of how the game used to be in the amateur days. \"The Barbarian ethos has always been that playing for the game itself is as important as playing to win and that has not changed. Sure we will be going all out to win, but I have told the players not to worry about making mistakes: the mistake would be not to try anything.\" The Australia coach Eddie Jones does not see tonight's fixture as an extra burden on his already weary players and the Australian Rugby Union will pick up \u00a3400,000 out of the proceeds of the game, expected to draw a 40,000 crowd. \"It is a chance for the players to enjoy themselves,\" said Jones, who has included only four of the side that defeated Wales at the ground last Sunday, with the No8 Toutai Kefu moving to the centre, where he will play alongside his brother Steve. \"I just hope the roof is closed in the build-up to the game.\" Moore felt that Barbarian officials were \"pumped full of self-importance\" and he preferred playing for the Penguins, a touring side \"which had some of the status and glamour of the Barbarians but none of the bullshit\". But others have different memories. The former Wales flanker Tommy David, a member of the 1973 Barbarian side that defeated the All Blacks in Cardiff in one of the sport's most memorable matches, said that the players did not always go along with the old-school-tie approach. \"I was on an Easter tour and the Wales centre Arthur Lewis was the captain. We were playing Swansea and were in the changing room, not in the best of health, when in comes Geoff Windsor-Lewis from the committee to give us a gee-up: 'Come on chaps, let's play it Baa-Baas style', and on he went for some 15 minutes. \"As soon as he had gone, Arthur said a few words. 'You can forget what he said. As soon as we kick off, we are going to kick 'ell out of 'em. Forget about rugby for the first 20 minutes.' \"Then he wagged his finger at John Spencer and David Duckham, two English backs who looked exactly the kind of player a Barbarian committee man would invent, flaxen hair and profiles. 'An' you pair of fairies, you've gotta tackle your gollocks off.' \"It was not until I watched it on television the following day that I realised how good it was. It was a game which never went off the boil.\" Edwards first played for the Barbarians in 1967, against the All Blacks at Twickenham. \"We were told to make our way to the Carlton Towers in Knightsbridge,\" he recalled in his autobiography. \"It was so posh that we had walked 200 yards past it before realising our mistake. \"The rooms were \u00a315 a night, a fortune in those days. A dinner was a week's wages to us so we chose the cheapest steaks, just in case we had to pay. \"The Aberavon second row Max Wiltshire was a bit more daring. He reckoned that on match days he played best on curry for breakfast. The hotel chef had to call him back because it was such an unusual request. 'Would you be happy with a salmon curry, sir?' 'If that is all you have,' replied Max, and the curry duly arrived with an \u00a38 bill to be signed for, one helluva breakfast by 1967 standards.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
