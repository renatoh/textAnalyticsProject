Of all the races currently priced up by the bookmakers on the ante-post front, Europe's biggest all-age contest is often won by a horse that has been trained specifically for the race. The French trainers understand this \u2013 as if from birth \u2013 and having won 63 runnings of the Arc, compared to Britain's 11, there is a lot to be gained for looking closely at any French horses that have been rested over the summer. Winning the Arc after a busy campaign isn't impossible as Aidan O'Brien demonstrated with Dylan Thomas in 2007, but that was a weak renewal and this year's race has all the makings of a vintage contest. In the wake of Rip Van Winkle's breathtaking success last week in the Sussex Stakes, O'Brien sketched out future plans for his stable's best horses and it was no surprise to see him take a leaf out of the French trainers' book by revealing that Fame And Glory, the current 11-4 favourite for the Arc, would be rested over the summer prior to a prep run in the Irish Champion Stakes on 5 September ahead of a tilt at the Arc on 4 October. Perfectly suited by a savage test of stamina when winning the Irish Derby by five lengths, Fame And Glory is a worthy market leader, but the value has long gone. A fear of O'Brien's horses in the big races these days means the bookmakers offer much shorter odds than is necessary about the Ballydoyle runners. Fame And Glory was no match for Sea The Stars in the Epsom Derby and if the season's two leading three-year-old colts were to meet in the Arc it might well be a similar story. But John Oxx, the trainer of Sea The Stars, has been cool on the question of an Arc challenge, pointing out that his fabulous performer would require a sound, and not a soft, surface to send him to the Bois de Boulogne. One horse who won't mind the state of the ground is Vision D'Etat, a remarkable winner of eight of his 10 racecourse starts and arguably Europe's best older middle-distance horse. Indeed, he went into last year's Arc unbeaten but finished fifth behind the dazzling Zarkava. A year later he has matured into a more complete and tougher individual, improving sharply to land the Prix Ganay and more recently the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot where he beat Tartan Bearer with more authority than Conduit managed in the King George. The decision to employ the magical talents of the hugely experienced Olivier Peslier looked a wise move at the royal meeting, and the two will be reunited in the Prix Foy on 13 September. At generous odds of 12-1, Vision D'Etat is well worth an each-way interest for the Arc. His trainer, Eric Libaud, believes his striking colt has the right qualities for a successful Arc challenge, and is dreaming of his grandest hour before the audience at Longchamp. For the notebook Acrostic 1m Goodwood Undone by a wide draw in last week's Totesport Mile, Luca Cumani's four-year-old made stealthy progress to finish on the heels of the leaders in sixth, and this lightly raced sort looks nailed-on to land a valuable mile handicap. The \u00a350,000 contest at York on 20 August looks ideal. King Of Wands 1m6f Sandown Developing into one of the season's leading three-year-old staying handicappers and rates as a possible future Ebor winner. For now a crack at the Melrose Handicap at York in a couple of weeks seems ideal. Scored by eight lengths at Sandown last time and is sure to win more races. Tip of the day Mull Of Killough 3.40 Haydock John Spearing's three-year-old has been given the benefit of a two-month break following a trio of smart efforts earlier in the season, including a couple of wins at Warwick and Thirsk and an eye-catching second to Firebet, a winner of his next two starts and a close second to Harbinger in a Group Three at Goodwood last week. Best fresh, he can resume winning ways."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
