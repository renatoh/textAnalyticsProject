'The Kruger National Park has two million hectares of wildlife reserve, 147 species of mammal, more than 500 species of bird, stretches 400 kilometres from north to south, and the entrance fee is \u00a39 a day,' says Roger Diski, director of the Africa specialist Rainbow Tours. 'It's hard to beat.' But there are also lots of good deals for East African countries such as Namibia, Tanzania and Kenya. Botswana, although home to some of the most fantastic game viewing on the continent, is the most expensive safari country because of its government's policy of focussing on high-quality, high-cost lodges in order to attract small numbers of high-paying guests. Unusual destinations such as Gabon also tend to cost more. Look for places with weak currencies - there is a good exchange rate with the South African rand at the moment. The former French colonies in West Africa, such as Guinea-Bissau, tend to have poorer exchange rates as their currencies are pegged to the euro. Flights can be surprisingly cheap. At the moment www.travelrepublic.co.uk has an amazing fare of \u00a3203 return from London or East Midlands to Mombasa, with Mytravel, departing 26 February, but usually the cheapest return flights to the main southern African safari hub airports - Johannesburg, Cape Town, Windhoek in Namibia, Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, and Nairobi in Kenya - are around \u00a3400 per person, including taxes. Trailfinders (0845 058 5858) has a good range. Go off season You'd be forgiven for being more than a little confused about the African seasons, especially as global warming seems to be distorting the normal climatic patterns, but if you go off peak you'll save up to 40 per cent on the price of your safari, accommodation and flights and not necessarily at the expense of decent game viewing. The dry season is generally considered the ideal time to visit, because vegetation has died and animals are easier to spot around the watering holes they rely on. But there are benefits to going in the rainy season - many animals have their young, the sunsets are better and the countryside looks more attractive and lush. It won't be a wash out either as rainfall is usually intermittent, in the morning and evening. The best quality off-season safari deals are for South Africa, because low season is between May and September when it's rainy and cold in Cape Town and along the Garden Route but dry and sunny in the northern safari areas - the best time for game viewing. The peak season, January to February, is linked to when South Africans take beach holidays rather than when foreigners prefer to go on safari. In most of East Africa there are two rainy periods, from April to June and then November and December. It's generally hottest February to March, and coldest July and August. Richard Smith of Aardvark Safaris suggests looking for deals in Kenya and Tanzania in the first two weeks of December, a quiet period before the Christmas rush. Kenya has good conditions year round, with wet seasons March to May and October to December. The annual migration of wildebeest and other animals across the plains of the Maasai Mara takes place between June and September, so prices rise drastically then. Somak (020 8423 3000) has seven nights at the Samburu Safari Camp in Kenya for \u00a31,199 per person between 13 April and 10 June, \u00a3560 less than in the wildebeest migration period. Pitfall: Many camps refurbish and partially close during off-peak safari season. There will be some rain, and wildlife is harder to spot in the lush vegetation. Choose a self-drive If you're confident about going off the beaten track, one of the cheapest and most exciting ways to explore is by hiring your own vehicle. You'll have the freedom to dictate your own itinerary and pull over if you see something interesting. In many areas there are lots of fixed camps which you can drop into for the night, plus numerous inexpensive lodges. Driving between a few campsites or lodges will work out much cheaper than spending a week in one full-service lodge. The main drawback is that you'll have to find the animals yourself and won't necessarily know what you're looking at. To get around this you could spend a couple of days at a lodge at the beginning of your trip, where a guide will offer advice on how to spot them, and teach you something about animal species and behaviours before you venture off alone. The easiest place to do a self-drive is South Africa, particularly Kruger, which has 17 camps, KwaZulu and Pilanesburg National Parks, and the Eastern Cape, which you can drive to from Cape Town. Those with a bit more nerve and experience could try Namibia, and its Etosha National Park. Car hire costs from around \u00a3130 for a week in South Africa, and up to around \u00a3500 per week for a 4x4 with a roof tent. Rates in Namibia tend to be a bit higher - around \u00a3300 per week for a basic car (see www.dialaflight.com, www.rovingrovers.com, www.drivesouthafrica.co.za or www.carrentals.co.uk). Travel Butlers (0845 838 2450) has two nights at the Sabi Sand Game Reserve in South Africa, staying in the Elephant Plains Game Lodge, plus five nights staying in safari tents at rest camps in the Kruger National Park, for \u00a3484 per person, excluding car hire. If you spend the full seven nights in the rest camps, it costs just \u00a3235 per person. Motorhome Bookers (020 7193 2873) has just launched its service in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. Two weeks touring Namibia and Botswana in April, starting from Windhoek, costs from \u00a3252 per person, based on four sharing a vehicle with two roof tents, including insurance, equipment, gas, camping table and a 24-hour emergency breakdown service. You will have to spend extra on food and supplies, park entry and camp site fees, but your trip could still come in at around \u00a3850 per person including flights. Rainbow Tours (020 7226 1004) has a package to Kruger National Park, including BA flights to Johannesburg, a hire car for seven days, and six nights accommodation, excluding meals, for just \u00a3795 per person, based on two sharing, until 28 March. Pitfall: You need to know what you're doing and be realistic about what you will see. You'll be restricted to the road network - you're not allowed to venture off road alone - and you should only get out of your vehicle at designated view points. Go camping No, you won't get eaten by a lion in the middle of the night... probably. Camping in Africa usually means pitching up in an official campsite with facilities and fences, or somewhere your guide can guarantee is safe. If you camp as part of a self-drive trip you can find a choice of campsites in Kruger National Park, the rest of South Africa, or Namibia at www.krugerpark-direct.com. A campsite pitch costs as little as \u00a38 a night if you take your own tent, permanent tents around \u00a310-15 per person per night, and you can use the communal showers and toilets. Alternatively, choosing a group-tour safari that has accommodation in tents instead of lodges ensures a bargain price. STA Travel (0871 230 8512) has a three-night safari with the Bundu Safari Company in the Kruger, from \u00a3210 per person, including camping in dome tents, game drives, night drives and a tour of the Jane Goodall Chimpanzee Haven. Pitfall: The Jacuzzis and butler service of a luxury camping experience are out if you want to keep costs down. This is as basic as it gets. Stay in a low-priced lodge The benefit of staying in a lodge, as opposed to doing a self-drive, is that you will be taken out on morning and evening game drives by the lodge's trackers. Trackers can take you off-road in pursuit of animals, which unescorted travellers are not allowed to do. South African National Parks has a network of accommodation in the national parks that is very affordable, with huts from around \u00a310-\u00a315 per person per night. A bungalow costs from around \u00a335 per person per night. These prices don't include game drives, which cost from around \u00a310 per person, or food - add these in and expect to pay at least \u00a3200 per week. You could also stay in a self-catering lodge to save money on food. Jembisa in the Waterberg Park, three hours from Johannesburg, has accommodation for \u00a320 per adult, \u00a310 per child, per night. Stay full-board at The Bush House, part of the Madikwe Collection of lodges in South Africa, and it costs from \u00a31,595 per person based on two people sharing, including flights to Johannesburg, car hire, seven nights' accommodation and daily game drives with Rainbow Tours (as before). But stay self-catering in the nearby Madikwe farmhouse and the package price falls to \u00a3845 per person. Pitfall: 'Be careful of very small private game reserves,' says Paul Campbell of Travel Butlers. 'There are a number of places with only 1,000 to 2,000 hectares of land that position themselves as private game reserves but this is not enough for them to have a decent amount of wildlife living in a natural environment and visitors may well be disappointed.' Join an overland tour Escaping the protection of a luxury camp on an overland trip will ensure you immerse yourself in Africa and release your inner Livingstone. You'll have a guide on hand, excursions will be arranged and you can choose a tour with cheap accommodation in tents or hostels. Because you're always on the move, stopping at villages and small cafes and markets, a good proportion of your money will go directly to the local community. Overland adventure specialist Dragoman's (01728 861133) cheapest safari is the 28-night, African Genesis 100 per cent camping trip through Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia, from Nairobi to Livingstone, with time on beaches and lots of wildlife spotting. The itinerary costs from just \u00a3550 including a kitty for food and park fees, but excluding flights. Acacia Adventure Holidays (020 7706 4700) also offers budget overland tours, including The Desert Tracker 19-day trip through South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia. The trip costs \u00a3635 for everything except flights and visas. Wild about Africa (020 8758 4717) has a 10-day camping safari to Namibia from \u00a31,046 per person including flights from Gatwick, most meals, accommodation, camping equipment, and the services of a trained guide. The luxurious version, with the same company, costs \u00a34,629 per person. If you don't want to be stuck in a van, Exodus (0870 950 0039) has a 10-day walking and canoe safari in Zambia for \u00a31,119 per person including flights from London, game drives and camping on beaches. Pitfall: You'll have to muck in and contribute your fair share of stories around the campfire. Luxury it ain't. Do a short trip There's one obvious solution to keeping the cost of your safari holiday down: don't stay for long. As there's no time difference in South Africa and you often fly during the night (the flight takes around 10 hours), you can realistically go for a short break without feeling hideously jet-lagged. Thomson Tailor-made Africa (0870 160 7433) offers three days in Kruger National Park, with daily game drives and meals, plus a night before and after the safari in a three-star hotel in Johannesburg, from \u00a3865 per person, including flights from Heathrow and transfers. A five-night break to the Shamwari Game Reserve plus three nights in Cape Town, staying at the Radisson, costs from \u00a3475 per person, excluding flights, with Visions of Africa (0845 345 0065), between May and September. Add in flights and it would cost from \u00a3900 per person. For people who just want a taste of the experience, Somak (020 8423 3000; ) recommends a two-week coastal holiday, interrupted by a brief two to three-day safari. It currently has a two-week trip to Mombasa that includes a three-day safari, from \u00a31,299 per person. For more luxury, Saadani in Tanzania is the first lodge in East Africa to combine the bush and beach in one location. Cazenove+Loyd (020 7384 2332) has four nights for \u00a31,283 per person including flights to Dar Es Salaam. Pitfall: The short safari side of a beach holiday might not be of the highest quality - with large group sizes for example - so check the details carefully."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
