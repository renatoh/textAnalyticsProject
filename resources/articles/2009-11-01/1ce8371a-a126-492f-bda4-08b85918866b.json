Three of them are included here (the first movement, Washington's Birthday, has already been included on an earlier Naxos disc in this Ives series), and they catch his extraordinary imagination at its most vividly fertile. Decoration Day, which weaves an extraordinary tapestry of references into a dawn-to-dusk chronicle, is one of his greatest achievements, and the sheer churning power and range of his musical voice constantly takes the breath away, even in miniatures such as The Yale-Princeton Football Game and especially The General Slocum, a memorial to a 1904 boating disaster that's recorded here for the first time. A couple of early pieces, a G minor overture and a Postlude in F, provide a reminder of the Brahmsian background against which Ives developed his unique style. The performances by James Sinclair and the Malm\u00f6 orchestra are powerfully wrought; at budget price, it's irresistible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
