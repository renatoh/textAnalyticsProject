A medical policy that he had in place covered payments for his condition and the insurers paid out \u00a34,000 for treatment. However, they then refused to pay any more - saying that he had been diagnosed with arthritis before his policy was taken out. 'What's new?' you might ask. 'Insurers are frequently denying cover for this type of reason.' The difference here, however, is that Herbie is a dog. It seems that dogs and humans are facing increasingly similar issues in terms of the complexity of their disputes with insurers. In fact, pet disputes are possibly more complicated in that the policyholders cannot testify directly, but have to rely on the evidence of vets, veterinary nurses and owners. In Herbie's case, his veterinary nurse had inadvertently landed him in difficulty, noting erroneously on his records that his arthritis had been diagnosed eight months earlier than it actually had been. When his owners took the case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, they won - and Herbie emerged victorious (and less arthritic). Complaints to the ombudsman over pet insurance are soaring (up 18 per cent so far in 2007-08 and up 23 per cent in 2006-07) - largely because pet cover is the fastest growing sector of insurance sales. If they continue at this rate, pet complaints for the current 12-month period will pass 300 by March. Common problems seen by the ombudsman include: \u00b7 Policy limits. Some policies have annual limits on the amount of individual and cumulative claims. If these are not clearly spelt out in the documentation, the ombudsman may well find for the pet owner. \u00b7 Removal of an area of cover when the policy is renewed. Dental and homeopathic treatment cover are examples of areas removed from some policies recently. The ombudsman has found in favour of owners when they have not been notified of the change, 'particularly when a pet is undergoing treatment'. \u00b7 Disputes over whether a particular treatment or operation would be effective. \u00b7 Disagreements over whether alternative treatments, such as hydrotherapy, are covered under individual policies. Veterinary treatment is becoming more sophisticated - and, therefore, increasingly expensive. Fees can quickly add up to several thousands of pounds. Recent Ombudsman cases have involved a \u00a32,000 dispute over a sick kitten, a \u00a34,000 vet's bill to treat a horse with colic and a \u00a312,000 personal accident claim over a parrot which had crashed into the toys in its cage and died (this was turned down by the ombudsman as the 'policy did not provide personal accident cover and... this type of insurance was only available for human beings'). It will be no surprise that we British live up to our stereotypical fondness for our pets. The pet insurance team at the ombudsman service is now used to dealing with distraught owners and warns that such claims can be 'very emotive'. \u00b7 Claims can only be made to the ombudsman after the policyholder has made a complaint to the financial institution involved and has exhausted that complaints process. The ombudsman can be contacted at www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk, on its helpline at 0845 0801800, or by writing to the Financial Ombudsman Service, South Quay Plaza, 183 Marsh Wall, London E14 9SR. Jasmine the cat proves the value of a good policy Despite the growing numbers of people having problems with their pet insurers, Jasmine, my Burmese cat, is living proof of why pet owners should buy insurance to cover vets' fees. Three years ago, Jasmine developed pancreatitis - one day she seemed OK, if a bit fussy about her food; the next she looked as if she was close to dying. I immediately took her to an emergency vet practice in Wimbledon - Stone Lion - which provides 24-hour care. They put her on a drip and started her on all sorts of drugs. You could see that the vets and nurses didn't fancy her chances, but three weeks, two ultrasound scans and countless blood tests later, she was allowed home - several pounds lighter and now diabetic. The care she received saved her life, but 24-hour care and scans with the latest equipment don't come cheap - the bills totalled more than \u00a31,000. Since then Jasmine has needed two insulin injections a day and regular blood and urine checks to make sure her sugar levels remain steady. She recently suffered another bout of pancreatitis, which chalked up a second bill of more than \u00a31,500. Jasmine is now 16\u00bd, still enjoying life, and we still enjoy her. The monthly insurance premiums have soared from \u00a39.99 when I first switched to More Than in 2003 to \u00a339.99 now, and total \u00a31,261, but as the insurer has paid out \u00a36,183 on various claims, we have had more than our money's worth. However, to ensure that you don't end up clashing with your insurer over a refused claim, it is important to understand what you are buying when selecting a policy. Pet insurance policies can offer cover for everything from having to cancel your holiday because your pet is sick to a reward if your pet is lost or stolen. But the most important cover is for vets' fees, for which there are three main types of policy: \u00b7 Cover for life, which renews the amount of vets' fees cover at the start of each year. This is good for ongoing conditions such as diabetes and arthritis. It is ideal for pedigree animals, which are more prone to chronic conditions, but is also the most expensive. Both Marks &amp; Spencer and Pet Plan offer this type of policy. For a moggy aged two to three years, living in south-west London, M&amp;S would charge \u00a311.62 a month for up to \u00a37,000 of cover, renewed afresh each year. The excess depends on the age of the pet. \u00b7 Twelve-month policies, which limit the time a claim can be made for any one condition to 12 months from the date a condition is diagnosed or treated. This is the cheapest cover, but after 12 months no further claims can be made for an ongoing illness or injury. For a monthly premium of \u00a33.99, the Argos Silver policy provides cover of \u00a31,000 per condition for 12 months, with an excess of \u00a350, for our two-year-old cat. \u00b7 Maximum-benefit policies, which allow you to continue claiming until the cost of treatment for a condition reaches the limit - typically \u00a34,000 or \u00a36,000, although More Than has a limit of \u00a37,000. The RSPCA Gold policy would charge \u00a311.40 for our moggy, providing cover of \u00a36,000 with a standard excess of \u00a375.
