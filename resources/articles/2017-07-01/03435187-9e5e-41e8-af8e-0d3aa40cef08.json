Roddick\u2019s wife, Brooklyn Decker, said the former world No1 decided to throw away nearly all of his trophies during a recent cleaning spree at the couple\u2019s home in Austin, Texas. \u201cWe have his US Open trophy,\u201d Decker told People magazine in an interview published on Wednesday. \u201cBut all his other trophies Andy threw away in the garbage.\u201d Roddick was 21 when he shot to stardom with his breakthrough win at Flushing Meadows in 2003 \u2013 still the last major singles title won by an American man \u2013 and finished that season atop the ATP rankings. His abrupt retirement during the 2012 US Open left the United States without an active men\u2019s grand slam champion for the first time in 129 years, since the inception of what then was called the US National Championships. While Roddick never managed to win a second grand slam championship despite reaching four more finals (and losing to Roger Federer in each of them), the outspoken Texan won 32 titles and spent nearly a decade in the top 10 during a 12-year professional career that will see him inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame later this month. \u201cIt was really upsetting,\u201d Decker said of Roddick\u2019s shock decluttering. \u201cHe did it one day when I was out of town. [He] decided that these don\u2019t mean success to me, these don\u2019t define me and I don\u2019t really care to have these material things sitting around the house, so he threw them in the trash. I think he saved a few but they are not on display.\u201d The 34-year-old Roddick, who has done occasional TV work in retirement for Fox Sports 1 and the BBC, is the founder and chair of an eponymous foundation with the goal of helping at-risk youth. He and Decker, who married in 2009, welcomed their first child, Hank, in September 2015."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
