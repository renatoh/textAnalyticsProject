But Leicester, for whom England flanker Tom Croft shone like a beacon among the mediocrity, will not care too much for that after a bonus-point victory against an inexperienced Bristol side returned the Tigers to the all-important play-off places, if only for 24 hours. Mind you, Leicester would have been mighty disappointed had they not bagged the full five points. With Bristol having long since been free from the threat of relegation and with no chance of qualifying for next season's Heineken Cup, Richard Hill, the club's head coach, has opted to give a number of his charges - including captain Matt Salter and Jason Hobson, the would-be England prop - the rest of the campaign off. Quite how that sits with the other clubs chasing a play-off berth is a moot point, but Premier Rugby are likely to want some answers from Bristol. That is for the future, although the West Country club did at least perform with nothing other than full commitment, even if they were on the back foot for much of the match. If the pressure is off Bristol, it has certainly been mounting for the Tigers, who played so insipidly when losing the final of the EDF Energy Cup to the Ospreys eight days ago and then succumbed in disappointing fashion at Bath on Tuesday. They had, moreover, mustered just 12 points from a possible 35 in seven league matches before yesterday. 'It has been a very difficult week, but we played with a lot of commitment,' said Marcelo Loffreda, the Leicester head coach. 'However, we will have to improve a lot if we really want to be competitive at the end of the season.' Next up for the Tigers is a visit to Newcastle, followed by what looks like being a crucial home match against Harlequins on the last day of the regular season. Leicester, who were boosted by the return of Ireland full-back Geordan Murphy following a seven-week absence, took only five minutes to breach the Bristol defence, with Alesana Tuilagi giving Aaron Mauger a run to the line close to the right corner after Dan Hipkiss had produced a powerful thrust on the left. Yes, Leicester were decidedly patchy at times thereafter, throwing out some ill-directed passes, snatching at try-scoring opportunities and conspicuously choosing wrong options. But Croft was never anything other than outstanding, whether he was stealing possession at the line-out on the Bristol throw or rampaging around the field with the ball in hand. More than that, he produced a quite brilliant try-saving tackle on Luke Arscott just before half time, when it seemed for all the money in the world that the Bristol full-back would cross by the posts in what was a rare attack by the visiting side. By that stage, the Tigers had claimed two more touchdowns for a 20-0 lead, with Ben Herring finishing off a catch-and-drive routine from 15 metres out before Tuilagi gave Tom Varndell a canter to the posts when the two wings combined on the short side - and one that had been all but vacated by Bristol. Although Shaun Perry, who was as combative as ever, scrambled over for a try against a somnolent Leicester defence soon after the restart, it seemed unlikely to make any difference to the outcome. And so it proved when the home side were quite rightly awarded a penalty try - bringing them what could be a crucial bonus point, come the reckoning - after Bristol collapsed a five-metre scrum that had already been reset six times. And that was just about that, although Bristol did finish on a high of sorts when replacement scrum-half Graeme Beveridge crossed in the final minute after Andy Goode had claimed a fifth touchdown for the Tigers.
