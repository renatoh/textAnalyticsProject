Before a speech to an energy conference on Tuesday where he is expected to lament that climate change has become \u201ca political battlefield\u201d, Turnbull told the ABC on Monday night the Morrison government had to provide hands-on leadership and coordinate a national response to a bushfire emergency, which has claimed six lives and destroyed more than 680 homes, and is expected to intensify in coming days as summer temperatures breach 40C. \u201cWhen Australians\u2019 lives are at risk, when they are being threatened, when their families and their homes and their crops and properties and everything they hold dear is being put at threat \u2013 that\u2019s a national security issue,\u201d Turnbull said on Monday night. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t a national security issue, what is? The national government has to provide leadership. Obviously the federal government can\u2019t do everything but the federal government\u2019s job is to lead and this is an issue that needs leadership.\u201d The former prime minister said the management of bushfires in Australia was traditionally a matter for state and local governments, with the fire events managed by a largely volunteer workforce. While paying tribute to the fire brigades working around the clock to manage the emergency, Turnbull said the current structure was no longer fit for purpose in an environment where global warming fundamentally changed the risk assessments; where the fires would get worse. \u201cWe can\u2019t kid ourselves that we\u2019re not going to face more and hotter fires. That\u2019s the consequence of global warming. \u201cThat is what you get if you have a hotter and drier climate, more fires and hotter fires. So we have to review the measures we\u2019ve got to defend ourselves against fires and upgrade and improve them, because the challenge has changed. You can\u2019t keep on responding in the same way you have in the past.\u201d Turnbull said Australians needed to understand the seriousness of the fires and the consequences of the changed environment. \u201cThese fires can be 1,000C. They will melt everything except steel.\u201d He recounted his experiences visiting the scene of the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria a decade ago. \u201cWe saw cars which had been caught up in the fire which people had been in, and there was nothing left except the steel,\u201d he said. \u201cThe glass had melted and flowed down over the car, over what was left of the dashboard and the floor. \u201cThe aluminium and the wheels had melted and it was left run out on the ground. That is what our firefighters and our communities in rural areas and areas around our cities are facing.\u201d Turnbull said when he was prime minister, and there were truck attacks launched in Europe by terrorists, he had thought it prudent to bring together state leaders, state police, local government and the private sector to develop a crowded places counterterrorism strategy to try to prevent copycat events in this country. He said a similar adaptation was required for disaster management. \u201cWe can\u2019t kid ourselves that we\u2019re not going to face more and hotter fires. That\u2019s the consequence of global warming.\u201d Turnbull continued to argue on Monday night, as he did in a broad-ranging interview with Guardian Australia late last month, that the Coalition struggled with the reality of climate change. He said the government roiled \u201cbecause there is a group within the Liberal party and the National party who deny the reality of climate change\u201d. Asked if Morrison and other ministers had declined until recently to meet with a vocal group of retired fire chiefs because they styled themselves Emergency Leaders for Climate Action, Turnbull said he wasn\u2019t there to \u201crun the ruler over Scott Morrison\u2019s appointments diary\u201d. He said: \u201cWhether you have the meeting or not, the bottom line is you\u2019ve got to address the issue. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all the tools. What the problem is that people are treating, on the right, they are treating what should be a question of physics and science and economics and engineering as though it were an issue of religion and belief. And it\u2019s nuts.\u201d The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, appearing on the same program, echoed Turnbull\u2019s critique. Albanese said he had written to Morrison three weeks ago calling for a national response. \u201cHe wrote back to me saying it wasn\u2019t required, and that everything was in hand, and quite clearly it\u2019s not.\u201d Albanese said greater coordination was needed because wildfires like the ones Australia is now experiencing did not recognise state boundaries. \u201cAt the moment, there is a single fire that is burning from the Hawkesbury right up to Singleton, a single fire. \u201cThis is connected with climate change. To say that is to not dismiss the need to deal with the immediate, which is keeping people safe, keeping property safe, the immediate response, but we need to accept that we need adaptation, we need mitigation and we also need a long-term plan to deal with climate change, because you have areas that are burning that have not burnt before, because they\u2019re drier, because of what\u2019s been happening on this continent in recent times \u2013 this is an emergency. It\u2019s affecting our security.\u201d Labor has called for an urgent Council of Australian Governments meeting to ensure Australia has the water-bombing aircraft, volunteer incentives and other measures necessary for the future but, speaking to the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday, the government\u2019s leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, said the government was already responding as needed. \u201cIf and when additional support is required, then, of course, we would consider that, but right now as we speak, you know, we obviously planned for this bushfire season and we have put significant measures in place and we have put significant measures in place for the future too, to better address, you know, these sort of emergencies into the future,\u201d Cormann said. Turnbull on Tuesday will address an energy conference in Sydney, and is expected to argue that southern Australia will face more heatwaves, fires, floods and droughts in the coming decades, with \u201ca huge impact on our water and food security, ecosystems, transport, health and tourism\u201d. \u201cWe in Australia, more than many if not most countries, are facing the actual lived experience of climate change, and yet the debate, particularly in Australia, is stuck \u2013 with many, particularly on the right of politics and the rightwing political media, refusing to acknowledge the science, instead stubbornly \u2013 and blindly \u2013 holding to their political positions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
