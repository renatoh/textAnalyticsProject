The cup is expected to sell for \u00a335,000-\u00a345,000. But it is not the trophy itself, it is its association with the most devastating event in Italian sporting history which makes it the most valuable, and scrutinised, item at auction. The cup had been won by the Torino team who were wiped out in May 1949 in the Superga air disaster. Torino were the Manchester United of their day. At the time of the crash they had just won the league for the fifth successive season either side of the Italian war-time break, and were also still holders of the Italian Cup. That Torino team have cast a spell down the years. Tommaso Angelini, an Italian players' agent, said: \"A source of mythology has built up over that Torino team because of the way wonderful players who had won just about everything suddenly vanished in such a tragic and dramatic fashion. The story is still very much alive for Italians. That's why this business with the cup has caused such a fuss.\" But it says everything about the financial and administrative chaos that marred most of Torino's subsequent 53 years that no one realised the cup was missing until January 2000. It had been placed in a public exhibition of memorabilia by Natalino Fossati, the club captain in the 1970s. But Fossati no longer owns the cup. He says: \"I gave the cup, some time ago, to a friend who was having financial problems.\" Torino officials were amazed to learn the cup was in the Christie's catalogue. \"We would like to see the cup in our museum. But we have so many financial problems we can't even afford to buy back what we still consider to be our own property,\" a spokesman said. Christie's officials are content that the anonymous donor of the cup for auction has right of ownership. A spokesman said: \"We understand this has raised a lot of interest in Italy but then that is not surprising, considering its history. \"It's got to be the most significant piece of Italian memorabilia ever to come to auction.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
