Using pure economic rationality, Professor Mishan argues that subsidising students because they benefit society is a \"fallacy\" - one that he says he would have included in his book 21 Popular Economic Fallacies, had he thought of it when it was first published in 1970. \"For if higher education is free,\" he writes, \"a man who chooses to spend three years at university rather than enter the workforce may be willing to do so even though it makes no perceptible difference to his future earnings\". As such he advocates full commercial rates on loans for students to pay the entire costs of their higher education. Mandy Telford, national president of the NUS, is not amused. \"There is no doubt that charging commercial interest rates on loans would put people off going to university,\" she said. \"At present we have a system where the poorest students are forced to work long hours just to keep their heads above water, while the rich, supported by their parents, are able to make greater use of their time. \"Commercial rate loans would hit the poorest students the hardest as they would be forced to borrow the most. After graduation all students would be forced to chase a fast buck to escape the burden of their ever-increasing debts, therefore shunning lower paid jobs in a public sector that is crying out for skilled teachers and nurses,\" Ms Telford added. One effect of subsidising university studies, claims Professor Mishan, is that \"bizarre and outlandish\" courses are likely to proliferate. \"In some courses (possibly medicine, electrical engineering and accounting), the respective IRRs [internal rate of return] may be well above that on commercial investment, whereas in others (possibly psychology, sociology and 'gender studies'), they would be well below,\" he writes. On psychology, sociology and gender studies, he says, \"you learn a few terms you throw into a conversation but nothing more, this is not a good allocation of resources\". Lynne Segal, professor of psychology and gender studies at Birkbeck College, is nearly amused.\"This is amazing. All we hear about is people complaining about boys and masculinity - lower exam results, more crime,\" she said. \"Mental illness amongst men is rising and depression - these are economic issues as well. He seems to be negating the study of human behaviour. It's a bit hard to take seriously,\" she added. Professor Mishan was a professor of economics at London School of Econmics until 1977, after which he moved to America. Since then he has been \"a little bit out of economics\" says professor Colin Robinson, editor of economic affairs, the journal produced by the Institute of Economic Affairs, which published the paper. Professor Robinson says that Professor Mishan was \"at one time a prominent economist... a pioneering figure in cost benefit analysis\". His most well known books are The Cost of Economic Growth and 21 Popular Economic Fallacies. But Professor Mishan does sound amused about his paper. \"This is not my field of competence - it's just bit of fun,\" he reassures us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
