Inside Portsmouth's ageing home, the top-of-the-table diners munched rather than gorged on their latest victory. This was mediocre fare for a season's best home crowd but the outcome was satisfying, even reassuring given that a down-market display still produced maximum dividends. \"With 13 games to go, we are 12 points clear of the third-placed club,\" said Harry Redknapp. \"That's a very good position.\" Indeed it is, even if Portsmouth's manager spoke with the kind of relief visible in many of the players' faces after seeing off a feisty Gillingham modelled in Andy Hessenthaler's combative style. Gillingham's player-manager has no doubts. \"Portsmouth will get promotion with Leicester - I've said that for months,\" Hessenthaler insisted. For all that, you sense that some of Redknapp's players cannot quite believe that the Premiership is within pinching distance. \"The play-offs were the aim, so where we are now is a bit of a surprise,\" admitted Arjan de Zeeuw, whose first goal for Portsmouth represented the narrow difference between the sides. Nevertheless, he believes Pompey will only become stronger in the final straight. \"Now we're here, we really don't want to let it go. And now there's a push for places, all around the pitch.\" As a member of Barnsley's 1997 promotion side, the Dutch defender is well placed to assess what it takes to reach the Premiership - and stay there. \"We've got a better team than when I was at Barnsley. There's a lot of difference between this level and being up there. One little mistake, and the ball is in the net.\" De Zeeuw also believes there is little margin for error now. \"At the start of the season, you think 80 or 90 points will be enough. But look at it now: Leicester are doing well and Reading are making a push. We've got a few tough games coming up, but so has everybody else. There'll be quite a few surprise results.\" But not one here. De Zeeuw ensured that by heading home at the far post from Paul Merson's free-kick just before the hour. Portsmouth's captain was in hot-and-cold mood and Yakubu Ayegbini's burning pace was rarely in evidence. But Pompey still have three more points to warm them.
