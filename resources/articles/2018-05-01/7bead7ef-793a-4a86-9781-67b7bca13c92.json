There were several highlights \u2013 two stand-out moments being Bishop Michael Curry\u2019s astonishing address and the Kingdom Choir\u2019s spine-tingling performance of Stand By Me. Curry\u2019s address was reminiscent of Martin Luther King. It gave the wedding an exciting, black American aesthetic, changing the familiar format for such occasions and making the event unlike anything before it. Curry talked about the redemptive power of love, that love shows us ways to live and that through love, we\u2019ll make of this world a new world. Not only in its romantic form can love heal, any kind of love has that power. These sentiments resonated beyond the wedding. His address gave proceedings an urgency, a potent vibrancy. Another moment which struck a chord was Curry\u2019s reminder of the resilience of faith during slavery. A black American Bishop talking to British royalty about slavery isn\u2019t something you\u2019d expect to hear at a wedding. It was a reminder of the road Harry and Meghan have taken to get here. It\u2019s still an unexpected sight for many \u2013 a mixed race woman marrying into the royal family. Meghan Markle\u2019s inclusion in the family gives it a modern, inclusive feel. She\u2019s the antithesis of the kind of person Britons would normally envision as a royal bride; a gorgeous, divorced, plucky, former actress with a socially conscious edge. She\u2019s an excellent match for Harry\u2019s open, easygoing charm. A dynamic duo, they\u2019ve weathered caustic critics, and done wonders for the profile of the royals, making them appear current and more relevant. They\u2019ve garnered huge interest among the young. Markle\u2019s ascent is the stuff of Hollywood but it\u2019s been a difficult journey, from the press\u2019s dismissive treatment of her at the outset to the stench of underlying racism that dogged some coverage, to her family\u2019s dysfunctions coming to light in spectacularly ironic fashion as the big day loomed. Markle joining the royal family may have some effect on who we see as entitled to join the upper social echelons, and thereby gain those privileges, but we still have a long way to go in terms of attitudes to race, class and equality in this country. This wedding isn\u2019t a bandage to bind the country\u2019s divisions. The ugliness of Brexit, the Grenfell Tower debacle and the horrific treatment of the Windrush generation very much at the forefront of current conversation within the UK\u2019s ethnic minority communities. Yet the wedding, though couched in pomp and tradition, still seems to me like a radical act. The ceremony itself felt radical, with its celebration of difference, its nods to inclusion \u2013 particularly in the gospel choir and its glamorous guests such as Oprah Winfrey, Serena Williams and Ozwald Boateng. Markle is already having some effect \u2013 that\u2019s something to feel positive about, a ripple in the fabric of our society, a change in notion of what the face of the royal family should look like. The world is watching. There\u2019ll be some sense, some admiration for a Britain that can be forward-thinking. The country has come together to celebrate Prince Harry\u2019s wedding to a woman of colour \u2013 and while we\u2019re in a celebratory mood let\u2019s think on Curry\u2019s notion of imagining a world where love is the way. And if we are to build on that from a ceremony that was radical in its feel, how about another radical act? How about making concrete efforts to improve the attitudes around race and class, true structural changes to level the disproportionate inequalities that minority communities experience at all levels \u2013 people who have made huge contributions to the country, yet are still made to feel like second-class citizens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
