Here, it is revealed that the wall\u2019s purpose is to keep out hordes of Tao Tei \u2013 terrifying creatures with T rex heads and great spiny teeth. There is, however, no way of making the Tao Tei actually pay for the wall. The film credits a host of writers including Tony Gilroy, Max Brooks, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, whose opening credits cheekily claim that their story is based on one of the legends of the wall, while outrageously borrowing a key plot point from Jaws. Matt Damon plays William, a mercenary adventurer who has come to China hoping to steal some of their explosive \u201cblack powder\u201d. His weird accent suggests that Williams, like Russell Crowe\u2019s Robin Hood, hails from that part of Tipperary that shares a border with County Durham. He is with his Spanish friend Tovar (Pedro Pascal) when they are captured by the Chinese: commander Lin Mae (Tian Jing) and strategist Wang (Andy Lau), who have a sneaking respect for the way these westerners handle themselves with the monsters. Will our heroes use the beasts\u2019 uproar as cover to steal the black powder, or do the decent thing and help the Chinese battle these hideous creatures? The Tao Teis\u2019 death agonies are as nothing to those of the film itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
