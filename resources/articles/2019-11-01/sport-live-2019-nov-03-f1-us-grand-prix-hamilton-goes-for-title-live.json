His powers show no signs of waning, and it would be more of a surprise were he not to overhaul the German great\u2019s haul. \u201cLooking at my Dad\u2019s smile says it all,\u201d Hamilton says in his latest post-race TV interview. \u201cCloud nine doesn\u2019t get close to where I am. Today\u2019s race summed him up. Beginning from fifth on the grid, his competitive instincts put him within sniffing distance of the win he didn\u2019t even need, despite grid position and race strategy being against him. Bottas was excellent, though, and deserved the win in a race that ebbed and flowed and had plenty of sub-plots. Anyway, that\u2019s us wrapped up for the evening/afternoon. Thanks for your company and emails. Bye. Expanding on that theme, Rosberg has tweeted: Anthony Hamilton is back for a post-race interview on his son\u2019s triumph: \u201cWho would ever have dreamed it?\u201d he beams. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really talk about the championship, every time we discuss things we talk just about the next race, and when opportunities like this come around to win the championship you have to think about these things a bit more. But he still wants to win, as you saw. I\u2019 m glad for Valtteri too as he had the pole. \u201cHe\u2019s pulled together a really fgood team of friends over the past four years, we have friends and family meetings and dinners, and that\u2019s all really good for him. His old sparring partner Nico Rosberg is now alongside him. \u201cJust a big congratulations to you Anthony because you have such a big part in his career,\u201d he tells Hamilton Sr, \u201cwe go back a long way back to when I was 13.\u201d Do you think he\u2019ll go to 2021, Rosberg asks him. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re feeling fit, you can keep going for as long as you can. When he was eight and we had no money, and he first got in his kart, we just said if you\u2019re gonna do this, you\u2019re gonna go for it properly.\u201d Our man in Austin, Tom Dart, has filed his race report: And here\u2019s a tribute to Hamilton by Johnny Herbert: 1 Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes+1:56 0 0 2 Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes 3 Max Verstappen, Red Bull 4 Charles Leclerc, Ferrari 5 Alexander Albon, Red Bull 6 56 0 0 6 Daniel Ricciardo. Renault 7 Lando Norris, McLaren 8 Carlos Sainz Jr, McLaren 9 Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Renault 10 Daniil Kvyat, Toro Rosso 11 Sergio P\u00e9rez, Racing Point 12 Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Alfa Romeo 13 Lance Stroll, Racing Point 14 Antonio Giovinazzi, Alfa Romeo 15 Romain Grosjean,Haas 16 George Russell, Williams DNF Pierre Gasly, Toro Rosso; Kevin Magnussen, Haas; Robert Kubica, Williams; Sebastian Vettel, Ferrari Bottas speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s a nice win, feels good, I\u2019ve felt very good since yesterday in the car. We had a strong pace, the only thing I could focus on was to win, but it was not gong to be enough for the title. I wasn\u2019t quite sure which strategy was going to be the better one but my race was good, and we both had some traffic. Big congrats to Lewis, I\u2019ve failed on my own targets, but he deserves the title. A union flag clad Hamilton is approached now: \u201cIt was such a tough race today,\u201d he says. \u201cValtteri did a great job, didn\u2019t think the one-stop would be possible. I feel so much emotion, to my whole team here, the people back at the factory, I\u2019ve got my family here, my aunt from Trinidad. My dad told me when I was six or seven never to give up and that\u2019s kind of the family motto, I was hopeful I might win today but we didn\u2019t have it in the tyres unfortunately. As an athlete I feel as fresh as can be right now, and for these races remaining we won\u2019t let up now. Pleased for all the Brits and people with the UK flags supporting me here. Verstappen is up next: \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out today \u2013 we did the best we could they were a bit faster today. For us it was a very good race, we had a decent pace, I tried to catch Lewis but that yellow flag on the back straight meant I couldn\u2019t use DRS so I might have come second. Hamilton\u2019s very impressive, just doing phenomenally, with a great team behind him.\u201d Kvyatt\u2019s been given a five-second time penalty. The Mercedes hegemony just goes on and on, in car and in strategy, and Bottas\u2019s performance suggests a serious challenge next year. But Hamilton will take some dislodging, his status as an all-time great even more firmly cemented. \u201cWhat an incredible weekend, I can\u2019t believe it, thank you so much guys,\u201d trills Hamilton back at his team. And he performs some celebratory doughnuts in front of a whooping grandstand. Meanwhile, Kvyatt and Perez are under investigation for causing a collision on that closing lap. Title number six is won. \u201cGet in there Lewis, what a drive mate, that is it,\u201d Hamilton is told over the radio. There\u2019s no response, the commentators reckon on account of him bawling. But a word for Bottas \u2013 a tremendous win from pole, though he had to fight his way back to the front on several occasions. Lap 56/56 Verstappen almost looks as if he\u2019s trying to take on Hamilton at the start of the final lap but locks up. He closes the gap on the Briton to below a second, but it\u2019s too much of an ask. Bottas cruises ahead of both of them, he\u2019s driven brilliantly in a challenging, undulating race and deserves the win. AND TAKES IT. Lap 55/56 Magnusson skids onto the gravel and is out of the race, seemingly suffering from brake failure, which brings out the yellow flag. It\u2019s all done and dusted. Lap 54/56 Hamilton may not win this race, but his competitive approach to it, when he could have coasted, says everything about the qualities that have made him such a serial winner. He\u2019s 1.1sec behind Bottas with two laps remaining. Lap 53/56 Bottas is looking formidable now, 2/1sec ahead of Hamilton, with Verstappen closing in third, two seconds behind the champion-elect. Verstappen gets the go-ahead from his Red Bull team to attack that second place. Lap 52/56 Bottas retakes the lead! The Finn attacks on the straight now, and this time he has the power and moves ahead of Hamilton to his left. Exhilarating stuff. It\u2019s his race to lose now, and he has fresher tyres. Verstappen too is now only 3.4sec behind the lead now too. Lap 51/56 Hamilton hold off a Bottas attack! Bottas gets within DRS range but can he turn on the afterburners? Not quite, as Hamilton turns them on even more. Bottas takes him on on the corner, but Hamilton comes again, forcing his teammate wide and retaining his lead. He just won\u2019t tolerate being beaten. That\u2019s why he\u2019s champion. Lap 50/56 Bottas is almost \u2013 almost \u2013 within striking distance, but not quite yet. The lead\u2019s below a second now. Norris overhauls Gasly to move into eighth. Lap 49/56 Bottas has some more traffic to deal with, those middle-of-field runners themselves jostling fiercely for places and points, and he has 1.2sec to make up. Verstappen\u2019s closing too in third, 5.6sec further back Lap 48/56 How they stand: 1 Hamilton +1.45 2 Bottas +5.89 3 Verstappen +5.78 4 Leclerc +50.8 5 Albon 6 Ricciardo 7 Sainz 8 Gasly 9 Perez 10 Norris Lap 47/56 Leclerc, having not done a great deal, duly sets a fastest race lap on 45, as Bottas cuts Hamilton\u2019s lead to 1.8sec. This could yet be quite the finish. The Finn is told to go for it by his team, while Hamilton\u2019s fans are beginning to celebrate. Lap 46/56 Albon moves above Sainz into sixth to put another top-six finish in touching distance. Hamilton\u2019s lead is now 2.3sec \u2013 he\u2019s had 22 laps on these tyres. Will they hold out? Lap 45/56 Hamilton is now 11 laps away from that sixth world title. He still leads, though Bottas has shaven some more time off it, moving to within 3.2sec of his teammate. Verstappen is third, then Leclerc is way back in fourth and unlikely to cheer Ferrari up with a podium slot. Lap 44/56 Bottas is gaining on Hamilton, but not at a sufficient pace; if those tyres can last, the Briton\u2019s going to win the title with a top-of-the-podium finish. Bottas may be bogged down but he set a race fastest lap on lap 43. Hulkenberg, hunting points, cuts a corner in a duel with Raikkonen and overhauls him to move into 11th. The stewards might have a look, mind. Lap 43/56 Bottas still can\u2019t quite get within striking distance of Hamilton, Raikkonen and Perez offering further traffic obstruction, and these problelms tend to be striking on the high-speed sections of the track. Kubica\u2019s retirement was prompted by a hydraulic problem, by the way. He\u2019s one of two drivers to retire today, alongside Vettel. Lap 42/56 Hamilton is offered the option for another stop, having complained again about his tyres; how\u2019s he going to call it? The title\u2019s surely his, now it\u2019s just about the win. He leads by 4.3sec from Bottas. Verstappen is third, a slightly becalmed Leclerc fourth, Ricciardo fifth, Norris sixth. Lap 41/56 Hamilton registers further anxiety about his tyres, though with 60% performance at the front and 70% at the rear, he should in theory be able to stay out. Lap 40/56 Hulkenburg forces Kvyatt wide and onto the gravel, moving a head of him into 12th. Then both pit, having had their fun. Bottas has now got clear of that bothersome traffic, and has daylight to Hamilton, who\u2019s now only 4.6sec ahead of him. Verstappen, in third, is now dealing with the same congestion that was bothering Bottas. Lap 39/56 Bottas continues to purr, but he\u2019s got some back-field traffic between him and Hamilton to make his way through. The lead is 5.8sec now. Lap 38/56 Bottas has eaten two seconds into Hamilton\u2019s lead in the past two laps. Verstappen, in third, is told he needs to take eight tenths of a second per lap off Hamilton to win \u2013 it\u2019s doable, but not easy. And he\u2019s not torn up trees in this race, Verstappen, despite his strong starting position. Lap 37/56 So to recap, Hamilton leads by 7.5sec, having pitted once, from Bottas, who\u2019s been in twice, and Verstappen, six seconds further back having also stopped twice. Bottas sets a fastest lap of the race though, and is going for the win here. Lap 36/56 Hamilton now leads, but he\u2019s reportedly just beginning to question his tyres, so he and Mercedes face a judgment call on how to handle this race. Will he pit again? Or is he bluffing? Ricciardo is facing a battle for fifth from the improving Albon, whom I was clearly right to praise earlier. Lap 35/56 Verstappen goes into the pits, having struggled with his tyres in the previous couple of laps, switching onto medium tyres. The Red Bull man is down to third as he comes out, so we currently are back to a one-two for Mercedes scenario again. Bottas is pitting now too, for the same tyres. Lap 34/56 Bottas has a poor lap, getting caught in traffic at the back of the field, particularly around turn 12, trying to lap Magnussen. His lead is down to just over six seconds. Lap 33/56 A how-they-stand recap: 1 Bottas +7.4sec, 2 Verstappen +5.72 3 Hamilton, 4 Leclerc, 5 Ricciardo. Kubica retires from the race, having been bringing up the rear in 20th. Lap 32/56 Albon\u2019s moving nicely through the field again after his early problems forced a premature put stop. He overhauls Sainz to move into seventh place. Bottas still leads from Verstappen and Hamilton, who also has the fastest lap, which means he can finish ninth and still win the title, if that record stands to the end of the race. Lap 31/56 \u201cWhy does Mercedes work to give Hamilton a one stop race, and not Bottas?\u201d asks Susan Preston. \u201cIs Hamilton the only driver able to do it? And doesn\u2019t Bottas get annoyed by the preferential treatment of Hamilton?\u201d Lap 30/56 It\u2019s as bumpy as an austerity-ravaged cul-de-sac on turn two, which will mitigate against risks at that part of the track. Meanwhile, further back Perez regains some ground with a fine manouevre on turn 15 to move ahead of Kvyatt and Stroll back into 12th. Bottas stretches his lead to 6.9sec over Verstappen, who\u2019s labouring a touch. Lap 29/56 Hamilton duly heeds the advice and drops the pace a tad, staying around the 1.39 mark to stay third and 11.7sec behind the leader, Bottas. Verstappen is holding steady in second. Lap 28/56 In the middle of the field, Hulkenberg\u2019s one-stop strategy is beginning to labour, as he\u2019s passed by Gasly and Albon who move into eighth and ninth respectively. Lap 27/56 A swift Hamilton lap 26 tooka 2.7sec chunk out of Bottas\u2019s lead there. Hamilton\u2019s now told \u201cIt\u2019s critical we make the one-stop plan work\u201d, cautioning him perhaps about not burning the speed too excessively right now. Lap 26/56 Here\u2019s the latest scores on the doors then. Bottas leads by five seconds from Verstappen, with Hamilton eight seconds further back in third. Leclerc is fourth, 24 seconds off the lead, with Ricciardo fifth. Hard to call, this, it really is. Lap 25/56 Hamilton comes out of the pit lane in third, and will want to go the distance on these tyres now. Vettel is speaking from trackside about his calamitosu race. He said he felt \u201cno contact, wanted to go through the footage. I had a really poor grip, struggled to get the tyres to work, had a poor feeling with the car straight away. I was just about settling into a rhythm and the the suspension failed.\u201d Lap 24/56 Bottas attacks Hamilton, having got the nod from his team, and he retakes the lead. And this time Hamilton DOES pit. Lap 23/56 Ricciardo takes on Perez and wins, moving into sixth and continuing an impressive drive in upper midfield. Hamilton\u2019s called into the pit but is having none of it. \u201cI want to go longer,\u201d he says. That\u2019s thrown a few plans. Lap 22/56 A bit of data boffinry on screen shows impressive tyre performance from Hamilton, who maintains a lead from Bottas but it\u2019s down to 1.3sec. Leclerc moves up above Hulkenberg and Perez into fourth. Lap 21/56 Leclerc goes into the pits, and is a little tardy with it, coming out in sixth. Hamilton leads by 4.1sec from Bottas, who has pitted. Verstappen is third Lap 20/56 Hamilton has been told by his team that they expect Bottas and Verstappen to go for a two-stop race, though the Briton is losing around two seconds a lap to Bottas at the moment. Norris and Gasly pit \u2013 it looks like we\u2019re looking a lot of two-stop races here. Lap 19/56 Verstappen\u2019s losing a second a lap at the moment to Bottas, as the cards continue to fall Mercedes\u2019 way. The Red Bull man may need to stop again. Sainz and Magnusson pit. Lap 18/56 Right, time for an update after all these comings and goings: Here\u2019s how they stand - 1 Hamilton 2 Bottas 3 Verstappen 4 Leclerc 5 Ricciardo 6 Norris 7 Gasly 8 Sainz 9 Raikkonen 10 Hulkenberg. Giovinazzi pits Lap 17/56 Bottas set a newfastest lap for the race on lap 16 by the way, as Hamilton has his one-stop strategy confirmed by his team. Meanwhile Albon\u2019s been told by his team that they\u2019ve spotted some damage to the car, and he\u2019s struggling back down in 13th, having lost six places since the start. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have bigged him up in my preamble. Lap 16/56 Bottas effortlessly passes Leclerc on the corner to move into second. That looked almost too easy, though Leclerc might have been chancing it had he fought that one too hard. Hamilton still leads. Lap 15/56 Bottas comes out of the pits in third, behind Leclerc, who\u2019s not looked too threatening but is now in second. Hamilton leads. That title\u2019s within sniffing distance. Verstappen is fourth, but still very much in contention here \u2013 that pit stop looks to have benefited him. Lap 14/56 Verstappen comes back out on fourth, posing Mercedes the question of whether to pit Bottas, which they do. Lap 13/56 Verstappen comes into the pits, as soon as the pit window opens, and hard tyres go on for medium. So it\u2019s a Mercedes one-two at the moment. There\u2019s some speculation that the damage was done to Vettel\u2019s car on turn eight before he veered off after turn nine. Lap 12/56 Verstappen is struggling to get much from his tyres here and has Hamilton closing on him - he\u2019s within DRS range of Verstappen, who\u2019s been complaining about his car. Lap 11/56 Vettel is out of the race. That suspension failure has ended his involvement in this grand prix, his first DNF here. Towards the back, Perez takes advantage of a Giovinazzi lock-up at turn 12 to sneak ahead of him into 14th Lap 10/56 A tasty little duel between Kvyatt and Magnusson sees the former overhaul the latter to move into 11th. Further up, Hamilton\u2019s starting to gain on Verstappen. As Bottas\u2019s lead moves over two seconds. Could we be headed for a Mercedes one-two here? Lap 9/56 Vettel\u2019s considerate parking after his mini-accident has prevented the emergency safety car from being deployed at least, so fair play to him for that. Anyway, out front it\u2019s 1 Bottas, 2 Versappen, 3 Hamilton, 4 Leclerc, 5 Ricciardo, 6 Norris. The top three in particular look serene while it\u2019s all a bit frenetic and fractious behind them. Lap 8/56 More woe for Vettel - his rear suspension has gone, and he slides off the track. Have the track bumps done for him? He\u2019s having an absolute nightmare here, and he\u2019s becalmed at trackside. Ricciardo passes Norris and moves into fifth. Lap 7/56 Albon\u2019s had a warning for exceeding track limits on turn 19. Three of those and he\u2019s out. Lap 6/56 Lando Norris has done well to move up to fifth, but there\u2019s a fair old gap in front of him to the top four, where Leclerc\u2019s still hanging in there. Ferrari tell Leclerc \u201cwe are going for plan B, and you need to close the gap to Hamilton.\u201d Lap 5/56 So, Bottas leads by 1.8sec from Verstappen who\u2019s 1.5sec ahead of Hamilton, as things begin to settle down. The junior Mercedes man is looking good. Lap 4/56 No further action will be taken over the Albon-Sainz clash. Looking back at the start, that was a masterful start by Hamilton, going round the outside to overhaul Leclerc. Ferrari say they can see the massive understeer Vettel\u2019s reporting but they don\u2019t have explanations for his grip problems. Wonder when he\u2019ll pit. Lap 3/56 Sainz and Albon are under investigation by the stewards over that first-turn collision. There\u2019s plenty of movement in pecking orders here - Raikkonen has gained six places since the start, and he\u2019s up to 11th. Bottas leads by 1.3sec from Verstappen, with Hamilton third. Lap 2/56 Vettel is complaining of damage. Another who\u2019s had some, Albon, is already coming into the pits, having been squeezed by Sainz and veering off the track. But the top two look unscathed \u2013 Bottas leads from Verstappen, with Hamilton in third. Vettel has also been overtaken by Ricciardo, leaving the German in seventh. Lap 1/56 \u2026 and away we go. The front runners get away well and Bottas comes out on top, but Albon and Sainz veer off and make contact, but return to the track. Then Hamilton MAKES GROUND ALREADY, he passes Leclerc and Vettel, Norris moves ahead of Ricciardo. Vettel\u2019s struggling already. Ferrari do not seem to have fired their tyres up, Leclerc is fourth and Vettel sixth. The general sense is that drivers will opt for a one-stop strategy, with the top five on the grid all on medium tyres. \u201cI have a bad feeling Lewis might suffer reliability issues today. Law of averages and all that,\u201d emails James Roe. Perhaps it\u2019s been that kind of sporting weekend for fans of English sportsmen, but I think he\u2019ll be Ok. It\u2019s a sharp, demanding start, a short uphill to turn one. And they\u2019re getting ready for the formation lap. More news on that Verstappen car bother: Red Bull officials confirm it had a hairline crack on the wing, but they got permission to change it, and it\u2019s \u201call done and dusted\u201d. A snatched chat with the man in pole, Valtteri Bottas: \u201cI feel a lot of pressure, the start will obviously be one of the key points of the race, that\u2019s the first thing I\u2019ll be focusing on. If I can come out of that in front, it\u2019ll be an interesting race.\u201d Verstappen\u2019s needing to replace a rear wing, with Red Bull engineers scurrying around his car, as Sky\u2019s Martin Brundle sets off on his grid walk, stopping for a jabber with the actor Matthew McConaughy, who casually remarks that he had dinner with Hamilton last night. \u201cWe could see something special today,\u201d he says. And Hamilton\u2019s dad, Anthony, is in and among it. \u201cI got the call [to come to the race]. he says, \u201c\u2018Dad you need to be here,\u2019 so the whole family are here en masse. It\u2019s unreal, we can\u2019t believe we are where we are, and what\u2019s happened to us. It feels like the first year in formula one every year.\u201d Track details: there are 56 laps in the USA Grand Prix, and the Circuit of the Americas\u2019 lap distance, across 20 turns, is 5.513km. The lap record is 1:37.392, set last year by none other than Lewis Hamilton, though he only came third here last year, behind Kimi Raikkonen and Max Verstappen \u201cHi from turn 4,\u201d chirps Kevin, by email, \u201cSurrounded here by fans from all over the world. Lots of cowboy boots in attendance too. I came from relatively nearby Boston. Looking fwd to a great race. Conditions are .... perfect.\u201d Yes, it looks a scorcher. It\u2019s a sell-out at the Circuit of the Americas, despite the fixture clash with the Nascar weekend up the road at the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Whether the additional carrot of live pop in the evening from Imagine Dragons and Pink is a moot point, but there should be enough glamour on the track anyhow. Get the party started. And those driver championship standings: 1 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes GP 363pts 2 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes GP 289 3 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 236 4 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 230 5 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 220 6 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 77 7 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 76 8 Alexander Albon (Tha) Red Bull 74 9 Sergio Perez (Mex) Racing Point 43 10 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault 38 How they line up on the grid: 1 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 2 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 3 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 4 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 5 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes 6 Alexander Albon (Tha) Red Bull 7 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 8 Lando Norris (Gbr) McLaren 9 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault 10 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 11 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault 12 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas 13 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Scuderia Toro Rosso 14 Lance Stroll (Can) Racing Point 15 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Haas 16 Antonio Giovinazzi (Ita) Alfa Romeo Racing 17 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Alfa Romeo Racing 18 George Russell (Gbr) Williams 19 Sergio P\u00e9rez (Mex) Racing Point 20 Robert Kubica (Pol) Williams Evening/afternoon everyone. In some respects this race feels like the equivalent of turning up on the final day of a series-deciding Test match, with the batting side 63 for 1 and needing only another 35 for victory. You know who\u2019s going to win, and probably how, but the the formalities, the celebrations and the sense of history still lure you through the gates. And it\u2019s quite the achievement Lewis Hamilton is on the cusp of: a sixth F1 world championship, which would put him second on the all-time list behind only Michael Schumacher, and a fifth in six years. His domination of this decade has been emphatic, backed by a champion team, and blessed by his adaptability, resilience and sheer talent. All he needs to do today is finish in the top eight, and he can finish outside it and still seal the title should his teammate Valtteri Bottas not win. The Finn is in pole, so must fancy his chances in this particular race, but it would be a major shock if his senior Mercedes teammate isn\u2019t celebrating tonight. None of this means today\u2019s race will lack spice. For one thing, the verbal jousting this week between Hamilton and Max Verstappen over the latter\u2019s aggressive style, and another near miss between the pair in qualifying yesterday, will make the contest between those two well worth watching. Especially as Hamilton will want to make his way through the field from fifth on the grid; his sparring partner Verstappen starts in third. These remaining races might also offer us into a glimpse into what the F1 world might look like whenever the Hamilton Supremacy finally ends. Charles Leclerc has had a lively first campaign, and the watchable Monagesque driver starts from fourth on the grid today, while another rookie, Alexander Albon, will also be one to watch. The Thai driver was sixth in qualifying yesterday. So in summary then, don\u2019t go anywhere. Lights out 7.10pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
