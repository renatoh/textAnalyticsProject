It starts with me finding a parking space right outside my front door - a rare novelty in London (or any city) these days - \"Ah, perfect!\" I exclaim. A little later, driving over the Severn Bridge into Wales, at one in the morning, momentarily glancing up at those awesome columns piercing the dark, again I mutter, \"Perfect!\" A fair bit later still, I arrive at the old stone barn on the Pembrokeshire mountainside overlooking the Irish Sea - you may recall me going on about it the last time I came here in the winter. I manoeuvre gingerly up the mile-long, deeply-rutted dirt track, delicately uncrumple myself out of my easyCar seat and stare up at a rare alignment of planets in the night sky. It's 3am, absolutely silent - you can't see another house, there's no mobile signal, no email. I can't help but say it again: \"Damn perfect!\" \"Except...\" and my mind defaults to its ongoing theme of late, \"What about all the suffering in the world? How can anything be perfect with all this pain and misery around me?\" \"Well, I'll tell you...\" whispers the old Taoist sage within. The Tao includes everything that is, was and ever could be. There is nothing that isn't part of the Tao - even nothing is part of the Tao. But the Tao can't be described or explained - that's its only rule - it's just too big, too all-embracing. So its followers don't even try. Instead, it's just accepted as a premise or a fact. In Magic Roundabout language, suppose the Tao was a huge, limitless being, an intelligent macrocosmos. That being, Big Tao (pronounced dow , by the way), would look about itself, see all the pleasure and all the pain in the entire universe, and being totally enlightened about both the beneficence and cruelty of life, say, \"Perfect. Absolutely damn perfect!\" This wouldn't be for any latent sadistic tendencies on its part. When you're big enough to encompass the entirety of all that is, you have the perspective of a span of an infinite number of aeons to see that everything in nature, all its agony and ecstasy, is exactly as it's meant to be and is all perfect. There is no sentimentality at this level. But \"down here\" on the microcosmic human level, pain hurts. Whether suffering yourself or witnessing others doing so, pain is a horrible thing. So as a responsible, feeling human, you do all you can to alleviate this suffering, whether that's giving pounds 20 a month to the Red Cross or organising Live Aid (for instance). The trick is to embrace both levels of awareness, the micro and the macro, simultaneously. Within the physical body, according to the Taoist schema, there exists a finer, more subtle body whose anatomy consists mainly of three so-called inner chambers, together comprising the meta-template of who you are, your innermost being or 'higher self'. The first chamber is in the centre of your lower abdomen and is responsible for the energy that drives you through life. The second chamber is in the centre of your chest and governs your ability to feel compassion. The third chamber is in the centre of your brain and governs your capacity to witness the effects of the other two and make sense of it all. Slowing your breath down now and relaxing your body, allow yourself to be aware of the life-force in your belly. Softening your chest, allow yourself to compassionately feel your own existential pain and your empathy with others. Relaxing your skull, let yourself witness the absolute perfection of it all. \"Thanks for reminding me,\" I whisper back at the old Taoist sage, whipping my bags up the steps and into the barn just in time, as the heavens open up and it starts raining cats and dogs. Inside it's warm and dry. I make a (nice) cup of tea, flip open my laptop, write this piece, flop into bed and fall fast asleep. Perfect, absolutely damn perfect. Dear Barefoot After years of \"crackling like fire\" rather than \"flowing like water\" I have discovered that the key to my \"finding\" Tao is in getting pregnant. I dare say that you yourself took a different route! But I am currently entering the last five weeks of my gravid condition and am finding that my energy levels are starting to ebb a little. Any suggestions as to how I can maintain strong, positive energy in this final 'sprint' to the finishing line would be gratefully received. Warmest regards (your Observer articles really brighten up my Sundays by the way). Lisa Newman Try using some Australian bushflower 'vital balance' and maybe some Floradix. Also, sit quietly with your palms upwards as if you were holding a bowl at waist level, then very slowly raise and lower the imaginary bowl 18 times with shoulders relaxed. This will generate chi in the hands, which you should then place on your belly to reap the full benefits.
