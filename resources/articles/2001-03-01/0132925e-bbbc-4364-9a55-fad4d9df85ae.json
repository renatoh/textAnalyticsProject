In July 1999, when Online first reported on the growth of text messaging, one billion text messages were being sent each month. By January last year that figure had grown to four billion, before a wave of publicity highlighted this once obscure service's usefulness. Now, 15 billion messages are sent globally every month. As the figure continues to soar, newspapers tell of dramatic rescues by text message and mini-dictionaries detail a new language springing up in the text's confined spaces. But what if you've missed the boat? Staring at your mobile, what if you don't have a clue how to join in? Feel left out no more - here is Online's guide to texting for the three most popular brands of mobile. We have opted for popular, well-established models rather than the latest whizz-bang versions, but still cannot detail every nuance in each model. But we hope our step-by-step guide points you in the right direction. Keying text The procedure for entering characters into your mobile is much the same, whatever model you are using. When you arrive at the text writing screen (following the steps published on these pages), the characters printed on the keys of your phone become available. Thus, if you press the 2 key once, you get an A. Press the 5 key twice you get a K, and so on. The 1 key usually throws up special characters like full stops and commas, while the * or # key normally allows you to switch between upper and lower case letters. Some phones now also offer predictive text input - where you only need to press each key once, and the phone guesses the word you want to type. Nokia Sending a text message 1 Press the Menu button and use the down key to scroll move to the messages screen. Press select. 2 Use the down key to move to Write messages and press select. 3 A blank screen appears. Enter your message. For lower case letters, press the # key in the bottom right hand corner of the keypad. For capital letters, press the # again. 4 The number of characters you have left in your message (the maximum is 160) is shown in the top right hand corner of the screen. 5 When you are finished, press the Options key. Select OK when Send is highlighted. 6 Enter the recipient's phone number. If you want to search for the number in the phone's memory, press Search and scroll through the numbers using the arrow keys until you find the right number. Press OK. 7 Press OK, and the message will be sent"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
