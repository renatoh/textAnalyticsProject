A conclusion was that better training was required in media relations so that the players could be viewed as rounded, articulate people with something to say and the knowledge of how best to say it, rather than the anodyne zombies many had become, skilled only in the art of saying stuff of any value in as few words as necessary for as much money as possible. Michael Vaughan needs no special training, though, for ever since he became England captain he has provided intelligent comment whenever questioned. In St Lucia, the beautiful Caribbean island that for the England team has taken on the status of Gruinard after the anthrax experiment in 1942, he was asked about match fixing. Does it go on, Michael? He could have obfuscated, but it did not sit with what he believed. So he said he had no proof but his professional knowledge told him there were situations that gut feeling told him might not quite stand up to scrutiny. It was an honest assessment. Days earlier, of course, he had received a slap in the face when a number of his team went on a drinking binge, and were shopped to the papers by a member of the public. One of the group, Andrew Flintoff, progressed to a more nautical theme with a pedalo, was dropped from the next match, lost the vice-captaincy and England's World Cup was never the same again. To Vaughan, it was not the drinking per se that was the problem but the inappropriate timing, hours after a defeat and more pertinently fewer than 48 hours before a further important match. It represented to him, and to Duncan Fletcher, a lack of respect by the culprits for their profession and more restrained team-mates, and for his position as captain. So he was party to a tough decision. Those who were in St Lucia in the aftermath of that mess will recognise - not without some amusement, it has to be said - the subsequent hang-dog, fruit-punch-consuming over-reaction of the team. Players clung to the shadows, afraid that a mobile-phone camera might catch them with anything stronger than a diet cola and pizza. The atmosphere had become as flat as a souffl\u00e9 removed too fast from the oven. From this point, Vaughan suggests in his excellent interview with Don McRae, they never had a chance. Now here comes a little self-delusion. England never had a chance long before that because for some while they had been a poor side, playing cricket to match while utilising a Neanderthal strategy. If they went into the New Zealand match (which preceded the bingeing) in good heart, as Vaughan says, then much benefit it did them for they were routinely picked apart by the Kiwis and sent packing. What Vaughan might find bemusing, though, is the reaction now to his candid words given that he is not revealing a state secret but reiterating something that was blindingly obvious at the time. Flintoff will be incandescent, say some, which might be the case, but will he be more so now than he was at the time? Is Vaughan telling him something of which he was not already aware and that the general public could not at least surmise? Actually I rather hope he will shrug and get on with his rehab, wondering if anything why Vaughan has chosen this moment to resurrect an old issue. For make no mistake, the England captain is one person who does not engage gob without first checking that brain is very much in gear. Vaughan is a consummate politician, skilled at placing the right word in the right place to suit the purpose of his strategy. To my mind, it looks as if it is reiteration of the total authority that might just be teetering on the brink. Further down his interview with McRae comes a rare hint of self-doubt. He won't be around in four years for the next World Cup, he says, so maybe he won't be wanted now. If it is a call to Peter Moores to put an arm round him and say \"of course I need you\" he may be barking up the wrong tree for the coach is his own man, too, it seems. But if he can see the beginning of the end, he won't give up readily, without a scrap. Meanwhile, it must be open season in the columns, unless Vaughan truly is a special case. I can't wait to read what Ian Bell, one of the drinkers, has to say on it all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
