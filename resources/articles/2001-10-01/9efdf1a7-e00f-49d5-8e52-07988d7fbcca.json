Oscar Wilde's Lady Bracknell would be apoplectic. Actually, eleven grand's not bad. In America the feeding frenzy for this particular accessory has reached such heights that Tina Brown's Talk magazine, in a recent gushing tribute to it, claimed that similar crocodile-skin models were on offer in the US for as much as $80,000. But even if you've got the money to spend, there is a waiting list. The bag's manufacturer, Herm\u00e8s, wrings its hands and apologises that demand for its leather goods is so high that there is a waiting list of up to nine months for finished items. Again, nine months isn't so long, either. Because the real hurdle is getting your name on the list in the first place. Demand currently so far outstrips supply the list is often closed. You can wait years. Crisis? What crisis? Doesn't anyone know there's a recession looming? Those who care passionately about such high-end accessories may recognise the handbag straight away as a Herm\u00e8s Birkin. That's Birkin as in Jane Birkin, known principally to the rest of us as the breathy-voiced tease who supplied the vocals to Serge Gainsborough's 60s hit 'Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus' and the woman who had her clothes torn off in Antonioni's Blow Up . The Birkin bag was created in 1984 after Herm\u00e8s president Jean-Louis Dumas met the actress on a plane. Jane Birkin was struggling with the overhead locker, complaining that no one made a handbag that suited her needs. Dumas invited her to the Faubourg workshops where the Birkin bag was first sketched out. For such a cult item, it's surprisingly practical: easy to get into and deceptively large. As one owner proudly announced, 'Career, cosmetic and gynaecological needs are all served by a single bag.' For years, Herm\u00e8s's bestselling bag has been the Kelly - so called after Grace Kelly clutched one to her belly in 1956 to disguise the telltale bulge of her pregnancy from a Life magazine paparazzo. However, recently, the waiting lists have started to swell with orders for the larger Birkin. Tech stocks may tumble and recession may loom, but the appetite for le Birkin in the haut monde seems insatiable. Kate Moss has one in denim. Naomi Campbell, Meg Mathews and Martine McCutcheon all have them. Bryan Adams buys them as presents for loved ones. Owners tell you sotto voce how they managed to jump the queue to get theirs - about how they knew someone in the company who pulled strings. An entire geography of power can be mapped in the time it takes to get a Birkin. Kate Betts, former editor-in-chief at Harper's Bazaar, knows all about that. As an editor, she jumped the queue easily for her first Birkin. However, she ordered a second shortly before losing that job in one of New York's high-profile cyclical media culls. Now at home bringing up her two-year-old, she doesn't know how long she's going to have to wait for her second. 'I'm not a fashion editor any more, so I expect I'll have to wait a little longer,' she says wryly. 'They're very elusive about it. \"Oh, anywhere between three months and 12 years.\"' Those in the know talk of their bags with the conspiratorial lust you normally meet in heroin addicts. One Vogue journalist who bought a Birkin in Herm\u00e8s Rouge leather recently lives in fear that her husband will one day discover how much it really cost. 'I'm ashamed of myself,' the owner confesses penitently. 'I think it's an ill-making amount of money to spend on a handbag.' She still finds herself gazing at her coveted bag, feeling faintly sick. She had wanted one for years and she knew that it's not the sort of bag her husband would ever buy her. 'For a straight man to think of going to a store to spend that much money on a bag is total anathema,' she says. So the Vogue journalist ordered it herself, and when the horrifying day came to buy the most expensive thing she'd ever bought for herself, she snuck into the shop armed with cash, chequebooks and credit cards, scraping the money together from anywhere she could. 'Oh, it happens all the time,' the saleswoman soothed her embarrassment as she counted out the piles of money. 'You wouldn't believe how often. You wouldn't believe how much of the housekeeping money goes missing.' 'Oh good,' said the guilty shopper. 'I'm not alone.' A recently shot episode of the Sex and the City - to be screened in the UK in February - sums up the atmosphere of frenzy surrounding the brand. The thrusting, sex-hungry Samantha acts as PR for the real-life actress Lucy Liu. Samantha craves a Birkin bag, but wants to jump the yawning waiting list, so she employs Liu's star power to jump the queue, ordering one in Liu's name. Unfortunately, the bag is delivered direct to Liu. When an indignant Samantha tells Liu that the bag was meant for her, Liu is understandably furious and sacks Samantha on the spot. A plotline featuring lust, corruption and downfall, without even a whiff of copulation: such are the passions inspired by the Birkin. It's not just America that's besotted, either. Japan accounts for a quarter of Herm\u00e8s's sales. Last June, Dumas opened a new Herm\u00e8s outlet in Tokyo's glitzy Ginza district. It was designed by Renzo Piano and cost $250m to build. However grim the Japanese economy has been in recent times, it's not so grim that they can do without their handbags. Herm\u00e8s began less glamorously in 1837 in the Madeleine quarter of Paris. Like the House of Gucci - which still reminds you of the fact that it began by making saddles using that famous horse-bit motif on its loafers - it soon discovered that there was nothing the 20th-century jet set admired more than a bit of horsiness. In 1922, the wife of Emile-Maurice Herm\u00e8s made a similar complaint to the one Jane Birkin would utter 60 years later: she couldn't find a decent bag anywhere. Emile-Maurice created the Bolide - the 'racing car' - a sleek, modernist design incorporating the newfangled zip fastener, a device which Emile-Maurice had admired so much on a visit to New York that he had bought the patent rights to it. So the Herm\u00e8s handbag was born. Unlike Gucci and so many other fashion houses, Herm\u00e8s has remained a family-owned company. Only 20 per cent of shares are traded on the Paris Bourse. Jean-Louis supervises every each new product. 'He decides very quickly - \"Ce sortira, Ce sortira pas,\"' Bertrand de Courcy of Herm\u00e8s explains. He's worked for the company for 37 years. Also, unlike Gucci, Herm\u00e8s still makes saddles. On the top floor of its old headquarters at 24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, is the Atelier de Sellerie, a small roomful of craftsmen still sit hammering, stitching and polishing beautiful saddles for the bums of the world's posh in exactly the same way as they have done here for more than a hundred years. The cheapest model will set you back about \u00a31,900. On a bookshelf sit the leather-bound record books in which the details of every saddle Herm\u00e8s has ever made here is recorded. This room can barely manage 400 saddles a year, a tiny fraction of the turnover of a company that sold more than $1bn worth of goods last year. But the ethic of almost over-meticulous craftsmanship learned in saddle-making spreads throughout the company. 'Don't forget,' says Kate Betts, 'Herm\u00e8s is a Protestant family.' The main leatherworks was moved to a gigantic atelier in the Paris suburb of Pantin in 1992. Inside its sleek white walls, the true idiosyncrasy of the Herm\u00e8s venture becomes apparent. Emile-Maurice Herm\u00e8s - creator of the first Herm\u00e8s handbag - may have liked modern designs and creations such as the zip fastener, but he loathed Henry Ford's Johnny-come-lately ideas for mass production. Part of the Herm\u00e8s cachet is that each product is still individually handmade. In the huge workrooms here, 250 skilled workers - men and women - sit carefully at desks surrounded by the normal clutter of modernity - minidisc players and photographs of their kids. But their tools are the same as have been used for hundreds of years. Between their knees, they clutch the giant wooden pince-\u00e0-coudre which grip the bags as they work on them with awls and needles, patiently stitching and then polishing the seams with large lumps of beeswax. For all the frippery that surrounds them, the bags are famously robust. They are hand-made using saddle-stitch - two needles passing across the seam in opposite directions. Each worker guards his or her own tools carefully. Retiring craftsmen sometimes chose a favoured pupil to pass their set on to. It takes about five years to become skilled enough to be let loose on your own Birkin bag. Employees typically have been trained for three years before arriving here, and will usually work with a more experienced craftsman for another two. A single bag will take about 18 hours to complete, from cutting to finishing. Each carftsman works on a single handbag themselves. Printed discretely on each bag in gold ink is a code which identifies the worker who made it, the year it was made and the particular atelier it was made in, allowing the Arthur Negus's of the future to determine any bag's provenance. That's part of the cachet. This particular workshop, here in Pantin, is denoted by the letter X. Workers bend over their workbenches in quiet concentration, interrupted by the occasional banging of an awl. In the 21st century, these ranks of artisans, busily practising skills that nearly every other modern industry has abandoned, make an incredible sight. This is part of the mystique you buy into with a Birkin. Whatever Birkin devotees say, you could buy something just as practical in nylon, but with an Herm\u00e8s bag you're buying a distinctly un-21st-century ideal of permanence. 'It could be done with a machine,' says Bertrand, 'but if it was, it would not be Herm\u00e8s any more.' In a corner, a leather-worker sits patiently polishing blemishes from a 35-year-old bag. Customers can send them back here to be renovated. Mothers pass theirs on to their daughters. In the leather store a few streets away, some of the finest hide in the world waits to be cut. Fork-lift electric trucks loaded with piles of skin labelled 'Veau evercalf' and 'Box noisette' drift past silently. 'Oh happy cows,' murmurs one visitor, 'to give your life for a Birkin.' Here, laid out on acres of huge, wide shelves are alligator skins from Florida, buffalo hides from Pakistan, crocodile skins from Australia, goats from India, sharks from Thailand and lizards from Malaysia. Here oxen, goats, deer and calves have all surrendered their skins. All the hides are painstakingly tanned and dyed every colour, pattern and texture imaginable. Herm\u00e8s has cornered world supplies for some of the finest leathers on earth. If Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field, Herm\u00e8s found a way of turning them into stylish accessories. 'You wouldn't want to bring Stella McCartney in here,' mutters a delightfully indiscreet PR. Around 80 coupeurs work cutting the skins. Only the best parts are chosen. Neck areas and flanks where the grain is not perfect are chucked in the bin. It takes two ostriches to make a single ostrich-skin Birkin. Only the best back-skin is used for the crocodile bag. The slightest blemish is tutted over and rejected. The care lavished on each bag is remarkable. Adjusting supply to meet demand is not an easy option. Herm\u00e8s is lobbying the French government vigorously to try to persuade it to loosen the employment laws that prevent their workers from working more than a 35-hour week. They have a powerful weapon: last week Bertrand hosted a tour for a large group of politicians' wives who came to coo and gape at the fabulous Herm\u00e8s bags. Back at the store, elegant Japanese women in Manolo Blahnik shoes pore over 'the book' - a sample book of all the leathers. One of the biggest selling points of Herm\u00e8s bags is that you can chose the combination of leathers and linings yourself. There is infinite variety. For some, this inevitably creates a hierarchy of taste. Talk magazine's recent feature on Birkins decreed that the must-haves were the bags made of the firmer leathers. It is possible to spend $4,000 and still feel inferior. Back in the real world, on the Eurostar home, the ordinary luggage that fills the racks looks - for a while, at least - dowdy and mean. But that passes. The Birkins are undeniably great bags, but the price is quite simply, nuts. 'The cost is ridiculous,' admits Birkin-owner Kate Betts. 'Prohibitive and ridiculous.' The economics of scarcity means that the price rises. And price equals exclusivity, equals frenzied demand, equals more scarcity. The company's finickiness has become a perfect marketing strategy - though of course Herm\u00e8s despises the muckily worldly term 'marketing'. 'Wealth,' wrote JK Galbraith in The Affluent Society , 'has never been a sufficient source of honour in itself. It must be advertised, and the normal medium is obtrusively expensive goods.' The strange thing about a Birkin is that though the price is downright obtrusive, the product itself is usually remarkably unostentatious. Aficionados sneer at the shinier crocodile-skin models, preferring the heavier, practical-looking leathers. In our heavily branded world, the discreteness of a Birkin is an elitism of its own. 'No! It's not a snobby thing.' Helen Fifield, the publishing director of House and Garden, is aghast at the idea. 'They really are worth it. All the other companies make bags that are so high fashion that if you can use it you use it for a season and then it's over. A Herm\u00e8s bag, any Herm\u00e8s bag, is absolutely timeless. And they're beautiful.' Fifield should know. She owns three, a Kelly, a Constance and a Birkin that her husband bought her for \u00a32,300. Those who love them swear they're the most practical bags they've ever owned. 'It's not like a pair of shoes that are going to wear out, or a suit that's going to get shiny over the arse - it's something you've got for life,' says the Vogue journalist who bought hers surreptitiously. Kimberley Fortier, publisher of the Spectator, peers into her Birkin and lists the contents: Evening Standard , Harriet Harman's report on asylum seekers which she's been carrying round for days hoping for a chance to get around to it, a Louis Vuiton make-up bag, a mobile phone, a Telegraph 2001 diary, a chequebook and a large marble egg. Her husband moved heaven and earth to get her a Birkin within two months, sneaking her into the shop one night after closing to allow her to examine the bag, only to have her say: 'It's the wrong one. It's light brown. I want the dark brown one.' The fact that he didn't sue for divorce still amazes her. She dreads the idea that the Birkin should become so fashionable. 'Because I desire neither to be in fashion, nor out of fashion. I simply wish to have the handbag that I want to have.' Because, in the end, becoming too fashionable could wreck the discreet one-upmanship of the Birkin. But there are other drawbacks too. One high-ranking executive tells a story about the time she approached a top media magnate for a pay rise. Unfortunately she had her Birkin with her at the time. Said media magnate took a look at her accessory and turned frosty: 'Anyone who can afford that bag,' he said, 'doesn't deserve a pay rise.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
