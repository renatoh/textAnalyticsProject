Employment in Britain increased by 32,000 to reach a record high of 32.75 million in the three months to April, according to the Office for National Statistics, fuelled by a rise in the numbers of self-employed people and women entering the workforce. The rise was the weakest since August and significantly down on the 99,000 added to workforce in March, although it continued to show that the UK jobs market was defying the worst fears over Brexit. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \u201cThe rate of increase in the latest three months was slower than in most previous quarters, which may be a sign that Brexit-related uncertainty is beginning to make companies more cautious about new hiring.\u201d John Philpott of the Jobs Economist consultancy said the rise in employment masked a drop of 38,000 in the number of workers employed by a company, with self-employed people accounting for the entire net rise. \u201cA closer look at the figures offers a slightly different story,\u201d he said. Britain\u2019s economy has continued to generate new jobs, sending the employment rate to record levels. Unemployment has also fallen, dropping by 34,000 to 1.3 million in the three months to April. The jobless rate remained at its lowest level since the mid 1970s, at 3.8%. But, some economists believe that businesses have continued to hire workers to meet demand rather than invest for the long term in productivity-boosting technology amid the uncertainty over Britain leaving the EU. In a potential sign that the country\u2019s jobs boom could be running out of steam, the ONS said the number of job vacancies in Britain dropped to 837,000, falling from 861,000 at the start of the year. Yet, the jobs market has performed much better than the wider economy over recent months, after figures on Monday showed that factory stoppages and cooling levels of stockpiling ahead of Brexit sent economic growth sliding by 0.4% in April. The lowest unemployment rate since the mid-1970s and high levels of vacancies has helped British workers to start repairing the damage from a decade of sluggish wage rises since the 2008 financial crisis. Annual growth in average weekly wages reached 3.4% in the three months to April, up from 3.3% in March. Total earnings, including bonuses, rose by an annual 3.1% in April, down from a rate of 3.3% in March but still stronger than forecast by City economists. The rise in wage growth also comes as inflation has cooled, further helping to strengthen households\u2019 finances. Alok Sharma, the employment minister, said: \u201cWith wage growth increasing pace on last month, outstripping inflation for the 15th month in a row, and record high female employment, the government\u2019s focus on pro-business policies and balanced economic management is delivering opportunity for all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
