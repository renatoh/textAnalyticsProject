Orr, the 25-year-old half-back, has rejected a club-record offer worth more than \u00a3200,000 over three years from the Tigers and will leave on a free transfer when his contract expires at the end of the season. According to Hill, the former Castleford player who acts as his agent and who will be at the Jungle tonight commentating for radio, Orr has \"magnificent offers on the table\" from two other clubs, and will announce his decision next Monday morning - with Wigan remaining the favourites to beat off competition from Hull. \"I would hope the Cas fans take what Danny has done for the club and understand that he's got to look after himself and his family,\" said Hill. \"I'm more worried about what they'll do to me.\" The example of Stuart Raper, who guided Cas to success before leaving to coach Wigan two years ago, and who is regularly booed at the Jungle, suggests that Orr and Hill may need hard hats tonight. Graham Steadman, the Castleford coach who had appealed to Orr to stay, now faces the task of avoiding a collapse in team spirit. There is speculation that he will transfer the captaincy to Ryan Hudson. Cas attempted to sweeten the pill slightly yesterday by announcing that Jon Hepworth has made his loan move from Leeds permanent. Hepworth, a half-back or hooker, has signed a three-year contract. However, Castleford's chief executive Richard Wright stressed that the club would still be \"vigorously pursuing\" further half-back options. St Helens coach Ian Millward said that Paul Sculthorpe is doubtful for tonight's game with a hamstring injury. Sculthorpe's brother Danny will be missing for Wigan against Wakefield after an operation on his knee, and Bradford's Paul Andersonwill miss out at Halifax with an arm problem. St Helens have announced an operating loss of almost \u00a3800,000 for 2002. The chairman Eamonn McManus, however, insists the club's finances are now under control."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
