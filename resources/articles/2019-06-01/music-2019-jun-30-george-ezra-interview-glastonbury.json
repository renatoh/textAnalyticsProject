We chatted to him backstage. Hello George! Now you\u2019ve hit the big time, weren\u2019t you tempted to arrive in a helicopter? No! Noooo! I really wanted to camp but I was told that staying in a tent wasn\u2019t the best idea. Is that because you\u2019re too famous now? Well, after my last record, I\u2019m kind of in the public eye in a whole new way. It\u2019s definitely dying down, which is good, but I guess you don\u2019t want to tempt fate. I want to be able to enjoy myself, so I\u2019m just 10 minutes down the road in a tent in the field. You\u2019re in a tent? Look, I\u2019m in a nice tent thing, I\u2019m not roughing it. The first year I played, I roughed it and loved it. But once you\u2019ve had a taste of the other side, it\u2019s hard to go back. I\u2019ve got lots of friends and family with me: my mum and dad are here, and my brother\u2019s playing on Sunday night too. You\u2019ve played a lot of festivals. What have you learned? When you see old footage of Woodstock, all the people there were in their own world. They were sat down, talking, dancing. As a musician, you\u2019re just one part of that. Glastonbury is the only festival where it feels like, for the audience, the event itself is so much more important than a set. As a performer, it\u2019s a really beautiful feeling to walk on stage because it feels like you\u2019re part of something. Are you going to go out after your set and enjoy yourself? Oh yeah, and tomorrow and the night after probably. I went out last night too. Last night? That\u2019s wild! My tactic this year has been to treat it like any other show. In the past, I wouldn\u2019t have had a few drinks the night before a big show. But I did and I just thought: \u201cWell, actually, I love our set and I love our band and there\u2019s really not much to overthink with an hour-long set.\u201d It\u2019s really short. We call it the \u201cpower hour\u201d. Are you going to play all the hits at the beginning, or save the bangers until last? We still have to be economical with our songs. If we played our biggest hits, it would just be two songs and the audience would definitely filter out! That\u2019s very self-depreciating. You can\u2019t be too precious: there are songs we\u2019ve had to lose for the set, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Honestly, you just think: \u201cIt\u2019s not about me today.\u201d There\u2019s hundreds of acts on. There are kids who will have their minds blown by someone they\u2019ve not even heard of yet. There were people at the Pyramid stage at 9am to get a good spot to see you. How does that make you feel? That\u2019s very sweet but my advice would be not to do that. Because they\u2019ll be missing other stuff. They just want to be close to you. They\u2019re not going to be close to me. There\u2019s a huge pit between me and them. This is your biggest ever billing. Does it matter to you where you are? Yes. But only in that I\u2019d want to do anything but headline. Really? But you\u2019re almost headlining this year! In three or four albums\u2019 time, headlining the Other stage would be incredible. Maybe it\u2019s a lack of confidence, but that slot as a headliner \u2013 I\u2019m just not there yet. I interviewed Emily Eavis for my podcast and I asked her if anyone had ever turned down a headline slot, because I would. She just chuckled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
