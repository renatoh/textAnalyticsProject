Haldane will say he was closely watching for signs inflation in the UK would fall below the Bank\u2019s target. In his speech about the psychology of central banking, Haldane will praise various features of the policy-setting framework that help guard against \u201ccognitive ticks that can affect human decision-making\u201d. But on so-called \u201cgroupthink\u201d, where people tend to adapt their view to conform to those around them, he sees evidence of shortcomings ahead of the collapse of Northern Rock, then Lehman Brothers and the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d that followed. He\u2019ll say it was too soon to tell whether other collective blind spots remained on the monetary policy committee (MPC). Referring to work by researchers at Warwick University, which analysed minutes from MPC meetings, Haldane points out that banking issues were low down on the agenda during the period of economic calm prior to the crisis known as the \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d, but rose up as the crisis struck. \u201cFor the decade prior to 2007, banking issues did not get much of a look-in. They typically accounted for only around 2% of MPC discussion time during the Great Moderation. With hindsight, given emerging pressures in the banking sector, this was a collective blind spot,\u201d Haldane will tell a Royal College of Medicine conference. \u201cIt is too soon to tell whether any collective blind spots remain. But compared with the pre-crisis period, the Bank today has two extra pairs of policy eyes through the prudential regulation authority (PRA) and financial policy committee (FPC). Joint meetings between the MPC, FPC and the PRA board now take place. These help strengthen the committees\u2019 peripheral vision and are a safeguard against groupthink.\u201d. His speech will go on: \u201cImprovements to the Bank\u2019s forecasting process have some considerable distance still to travel\u201d. Haldane, who joined the MPC in June, gives little away on his current view over the best path for interest rates in the speech. He has been widely described as a \u201cdove\u201d on borrowing costs, erring towards looser policy, and recently described himself as having grown \u201cgloomier\u201d over the economy. Last week, the Bank signalled interest rates could remain on hold at the record low of 0.5% until next autumn as inflation is likely to fall below 1% in early 2015. The Bank has a government-set target of inflation of 2% on the consumer prices index (CPI) measure and has to write an open letter to the chancellor if the target missed by more than 1 percentage point on either side. Haldane will also raise the threat of low inflation in his speech on Monday, highlighting what he see as success in keeping inflation in check, or taming the \u201cinflation tiger\u201d, by giving central banks independence and increasing public confidence that inflation will not be allowed to climb too high, but he will warn such a public view can work the other way in the form of low and falling inflation expectations. \u201cAs some countries are finding today, the tiger is capable of biting back,\u201d Haldane says. \u201cSo far, inflation expectations in the UK have held up and, on a central view, the Bank expects inflation to be on target at a 2-3 year horizon. But this tiger needs careful handling. Even in the UK, some measures of household inflation expectations have fallen slightly over the course of this year. The tiger has stirred. Wearing my MPC hat, and with UK inflation already below target, this is something I am watching like a dove.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
