The prayer is contained in a video, first published by Eternity News but later removed and republished by Queensland Parents for Secular State Schools, in which Morrison explains his faith gives him \u201cenormous encouragement\u201d in how to respond to the crisis. Morrison, Australia\u2019s first evangelical Christian prime minister, has made no secret of his religious faith, referring to his re-election in 2019 as a \u201cmiracle\u201d. Many other former prime ministers, including Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Kevin Rudd, identify as Christians. On 23 March Morrison called for Australians of faith to pray as parliament reconvened to pass the second tranche of fiscal support for those harmed by the economic effects of Covid-19 shutdowns. But glimpses of Morrison\u2019s personal practice of Christianity are rarer, such as his decision to invite cameras into Horizon church at Easter in 2019. In the video, which appears to be filmed in his prime ministerial office, Morrison thanked people for their prayers and described the world as \u201clargely in trauma \u2026 with the scale and pace of what is unfolding \u2013 this is incomprehensible, even just a month ago, what we\u2019re seeing today\u201d. \u201cPray for the premiers and chief ministers, they\u2019ve joined me in a national cabinet \u2013 which is unprecedented for Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a moment like when Moses looked out at the sea and held up his staff \u2026 there are moments of great faith in this. \u201cBut as a prime minister I have to take my decisions based on very strong advice and exercise the best judgment I can. \u201cAnd my faith gives me an enormous encouragement in how I can make those decisions and try and do that in the best way I can.\u201d Morrison then shares biblical verses from Psalms about God delivering the righteous from troubles and from Isaiah that the Lord \u201cwill guide you always\u201d and \u201cwill satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land\u201d. \u201cYour people will rebuild the ancient ruins \u2013 that\u2019s a prophecy over our country, I believe \u2013 and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called repairer of broken walls, and a restorer of streets with dwellings. \u201cI pray that we will be a restorer of streets, with people in them, businesses open again, Australians going about their lives again, returning to their jobs, returning to their livelihoods, returning to normal times in our schools so children can learn and that we can get to the other side of this.\u201d Morrison offers a prayer that begins \u201cheavenly father, we just commit our nation to you in this terrible time of great need and suffering of so many people\u201d. \u201cAnd we do this also for the entire world \u2013 in places far from this country there are people suffering even more, going through tremendous hardship, crying out.\u201d Morrison also prays for \u201ccolleagues in parliamentary roles, it doesn\u2019t matter what party they\u2019re from\u201d, ministers in his cabinet, and again for the premiers and chief ministers. \u201cPray that you\u2019ll keep the national cabinet strong and united, and we may be able to face each day and each challenge with unity and purpose.\u201d Bishop Phillip Huggins, the National Council of Churches Australia president, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe prime minister says he\u2019s a person of faith \u2013 therefore he prays. \u201cHe\u2019s just being true to himself \u2013 likewise \u2013 the prayer we\u2019re asking people to share is consistent with our tradition.\u201d The NCCA prayer asks worshippers to pray for \u201cthose in need of healing\u201d and the \u201cHoly Spirit\u2019s discernment amidst the many choices and decisions facing our national, community and medical leaders\u201d. Martyn Iles, the Australian Christian Lobby managing director, said it was \u201crefreshing to see a prime minister with the humility to consider and pray for others in the midst of crisis\u201d. \u201cAlongside his emphasis on practical measures, it demonstrates good leadership,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
