I started the season with people asking about my philosophy. I keep redoing it. I lost probably five players in the first month. So you have to get others, but you can\u2019t buy them,\u201d Mellon says of life at a club pushed into the relegation zone by Saturday\u2019s results. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a training ground, we come 29 miles to here, we get sandwiches from the local butty shop, the soup arrives just about half warm and we wash our own training kit. But we still count ourselves very fortunate we are in football.\u201d Mellon is talking at Lilleshall, the national sports and conference centre, in Shropshire, where his players have been preparing for Monday\u2019s FA Cup fifth-round tie at home against United \u2013 a game that is probably about as appealing to Louis van Gaal right now as that lukewarm soup. Brimming with excitement, Mellon sounds like he cannot wait for kick-off. The 43-year-old Scot, who led Shrewsbury to promotion from League Two last season, is an effervescent character, fiercely ambitious and not short of ways to motivate his players, with Jamie Vardy\u2019s name chief among them. It was only four years ago that Vardy, now the Premier League\u2019s leading scorer, was turning out for Fleetwood Town in the Conference and Mellon, who was in charge of the club at the time, admits he often cites the England international\u2019s rags-to-riches story to try to inspire others to make a similar journey. \u201cI am like a big schoolboy when it comes to football,\u201d Mellon says, smiling. \u201cI still dream, I have ambition, I have managed against Manchester United about 1,000 times in my playground career, this time I\u2019m doing it for real. I want my players to believe. I hate it when a player loses ambition. What sometimes happens at this level is that the ambition goes, then the imagination goes, and you can\u2019t improve them. \u201cI encourage them all the time to be ambitious, believe they can be Jamie Vardy. We\u2019ve had Ryan Woods and Connor Goldson here, 18 months ago they were just coming out of youth teams, now they\u2019re playing in the Championship [for Brentford and Brighton respectively] in front of crowds of 28,000. \u201cIn the week before our last game we showed some footage of strikers at Fiorentina and Southampton, their movement and imagination. You see our players rising up, getting that excitement: \u2018I could have a bit of that\u2019. It inspires them. They played in the afternoon and two of the three lads I showed it to scored. There were big smiles on faces.\u201d Mellon, whose playing career took him to Bristol City, West Bromwich Albion, Blackpool, Tranmere and Burnley, took over the recently-relegated Shrewsbury in May 2014, at a time when he was studying on the Football Association\u2019s Uefa pro licence course alongside Ryan Giggs. Van Gaal\u2019s No2 has long had a reputation for being a quietly spoken man but Mellon saw another side at St George\u2019s Park. \u201cI don\u2019t buy into the idea that Ryan\u2019s not forceful enough. I think he\u2019s very steely-minded, very clear about how he wants the game played, has a good presence about him. But I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll know if anybody\u2019s going to be a manager until they\u2019re in that technical area, they get beat and certain things get thrown at them, how they deal with it \u2013 that\u2019s when you\u2019ll know.\u201d Although this is the first time Shrewsbury have reached this stage of the FA Cup since a 1-0 defeat against Arsenal in 1991, they hosted Chelsea in a League Cup tie only 16 months ago and won many plaudits on an evening when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side required a late own goal to squeeze into the quarter-finals. Mellon remembers initially thinking Mourinho was joking when the he spoke so warmly about Shrewsbury afterwards. \u201cWe played with a back three and that wasn\u2019t something a lot of teams were doing. He felt that was new for his team. He was really complimentary about how brave we were when we got the ball, how determined we were, not kick you off the pitch, roughen you up \u2013 we wanted to give a better account of ourselves than that. He actually said we gave them a tougher game than a lot of their opponents that season. I laughed. He replied: \u2018No I\u2019m serious. I congratulate you on that.\u2019 I said: \u2018Thanks, sorry we never knocked you out.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
