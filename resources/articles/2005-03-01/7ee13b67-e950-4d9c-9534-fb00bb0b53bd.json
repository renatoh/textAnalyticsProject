Fletcher will team up with Carl Robinson in a new-look midfield in the World Cup qualifier against Austria in Cardiff on Saturday and the 24-year-old is grateful to have been handed his chance. \"I don't think there is a player anywhere in the world like Sav but I am grateful the new manager has put his faith in me and given me the chance,\" said the West Ham United midfielder. \"It is really encouraging when a manager puts his confidence in you; when he does that, you want to repay him. \"I know that myself and Carl Robinson will be intent on doing that; only that will make sure the manager keeps picking us.\" Savage walked out on the Welsh national team after Toshack omitted him from the squad for Saturday's game with Austria and the return in Vienna next Wednesday. The manager pointed to the form of Fletcher and Robinson as his reason for dropping the Blackburn Rovers midfielder. And, though Robinson will be winning his 21st cap against the Austrians, this will only be Fletcher's fifth, putting him firmly in the international rookie category. \"I don't feel added pressure because Robbie is not here and the manager has talked of myself and Carl Robinson filling that gap and being given a chance,\" added Fletcher. \"Sav made his decision, that is up to him and he has been a fantastic servant for his country over the past few years. \"You will miss quality players and I can't allow myself to start thinking and worrying that I am replacing him. I have to get on with it and do my best, that's all I can do. I have never started a competitive game for Wales, so I just want to go out and do my best for the manager and the fans.\" As for Savage's decision to quit, Fletcher said: \"It is up to others to decide what they want to do but I do accept that international football takes up a lot of your time. \"But in the end I only want to play and do well for myself and the team and I am obviously delighted to be in this position. There are still players around me - John Hartson, Ryan Giggs and Craig Bellamy - who have great experience and that will help me. \"As for our position in the group with only two points, it is never mission impossible. If we felt that, there would be no point turning up. \"We can do it and must continue to think that. These two games will be the biggest of my career but the pressure is off us because nobody expects us to qualify now.\" - PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
