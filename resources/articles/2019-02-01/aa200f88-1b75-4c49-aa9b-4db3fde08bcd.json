Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side had leapfrogged Norwich at the summit on Saturday after their draw at Middlesbrough, only to see the Canaries skip past them again with a win over Ipswich Town on Sunday. But Leeds took pole position once more after first-half goals from Pontus Jansson and Jack Harrison secured victory over mid-table Swansea, though they had to endure a nervy finish after Oliver McBurnie\u2019s 87th-minute penalty for the visitors. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why we only won by one goal because we dominated the game and had many chances to score,\u201d said Bielsa. \u201cWhen we win the game we can wait for the next game with serenity.\u201d Norwich, meanwhile, slipped to a surprise 3-1 defeat against Preston. Ben Davies, Paul Gallagher and Sean Maguire put the home side in a commanding position before Teemu Pukki scored a late consolation for Daniel Farke\u2019s side. Third-placed Sheffield United, who would have gone top on Friday had they held on to a 3-0 lead at Aston Villa, closed the gap on Norwich with Richard Stearman scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win over Middlesbrough, who had Daniel Ayala sent off in the second half. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really difficult couple of days,\u201d said the United manager, Chris Wilder. \u201cWe felt we had to produce a big performance.\u201d Play-off chasing Derby were held to a 1-1 draw at the bottom club at Ipswich, Jon Nolan cancelling out Tom Lawrence\u2019s early strike for the Rams, and Aston Villa\u2019s slim hopes of a top-six finish are fading after a 1-0 defeat at Brentford, thanks to Neal Maupay\u2019s last-minute goal. Wigan continue to edge away from the relegation zone after a 0-0 draw against Stoke but the big winners at the bottom were Reading who surged out of the relegation zone with a 2-1 win over Blackburn. Nelson Oliveira, playing in a mask after the facial injuries suffered against Villa this month, scored the late winner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
