The city, under 24 hours away from Liverpool's biggest match for at least 15 years, is not the place that Boris Johnson portrayed it as. Rather than wallowing in self-pity, Liverpool is indulging in its self-worth. The mood is detectable in the public's voices. Mention the Champions League final and you hear the high-pitched Liverpool accent rise another octave. Ironically, this city of positivity is being exited rapidly. \"It's deserted now,\" said Jimmy Mooney, a 40-year-old from Toxteth, referring to the huge numbers on their way to Istanbul. He admits that he is the odd one out among his seven brothers as he does not follow football. Despite his lack of interest in the game, he cannot avoid it. \"It's been the talk of the town.\" Toxteth is a closely knit area and that communal spirit makes Liverpool's success all the more rousing for its residents. \"There are lots of nationalities here who all get on,\" said Mooney, who is of Trinidadian origin. \"Lots of people knock it, but there's a real community spirit here. In other places, it is about how big your house is. Here people look out for each other.\" That spirit is obvious when you take a glance at Kenny Erangey's home, situated close to where Ringo Starr once lived. Kenny has Downes Syndrome. He is a fanatical Liverpool supporter and those around him have helped turn his home into a Liverpool shrine. There is not one place you can turn to without seeing the club's memorabilia. The city is red and white. Admiral Carpets has a Liverpool mat hanging in its window - albeit alongside an Everton one. Flags are hot property with many Liverpudlians complaining of being unable to get their hands on one at lunchtime yesterday. Andrew Edge, 21, has been selling flags close to Anfield. \"We've sold about 10 times as many as normal,\" he said. Around the corner at The Park pub, opposite the Kop, the barman Ronnie Bate is ready for the exiting Liverpudlians to be replaced by hordes of incomers. \"I have got a big load of people coming from Ireland,\" said the 50-year-old. \"It's on normal telly but they just want to be here. Everybody wants to be around this area to celebrate when we beat Milan.\" Bate's only concern is that the victory parade would be tomorrow, meaning many travelling fans would miss it. That is not on those supporters' minds at the moment, though. At Liverpool airport, where more flags hang proudly at the entrance, there is a real party atmosphere. The statue of John Lennon is bedecked in a Liverpool cap and scarf. Dan Bunder, 30, is especially pleased to be going. \"You have to have been to six Champions League matches and I had been to five,\" he said. \"Then it dropped from six to five. I called my wife. I have waited 20 years for this.\" So many Liverpudlians are joining him that 20 extra flights were chartered for between 3am and 5am today. \"This is the busiest few days since the airport opened,\" said Adele Platt, 37, who works for Co-op Travel at the terminal. Mally Hughes has been a Reds fan since 1961: \"I went to Paris (for the 1981 win],\" said the 52-year-old, who will be in Liverpool tonight. But he added: \"The atmosphere is better this year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
