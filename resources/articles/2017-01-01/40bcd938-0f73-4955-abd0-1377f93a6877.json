To loud cheers, the first Q train to run from 96th Street in Manhattan to Coney Island set off soon after noon. New York governor Andrew Cuomo was aboard to celebrate an engineering project his administration has made a matter of state and city pride. \u201cIt\u2019s the inaugural ride,\u201d Cuomo told a large crowd who pushed their way into the subway cars. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting, and it\u2019s a great way to start the new year here in New York.\u201d The completion of the $4.4bn Second Avenue line \u2013 technically a four-stop extension of the Q \u2013 is a substantial achievement for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The line was conceived in 1929, at the height of the Jazz Age, and its construction started 45 years ago, in 1972. It stopped soon after when the city ran out of money. The project restarted in 2007 and was completed on time. The nearly two-mile segment adds stations along Second Avenue in the Upper East Side, at 96th, 86th and 72nd streets, and a new connection to an existing line at 63rd. City planners have long considered the extension critical to easing congestion on a system that carries 5.6 million riders on an average weekday. On Sunday, Second Avenue residents expressed excitement over their new mobility but also anxiety over whether the line would hasten gentrification in an area widely regarded as one of the last comparatively affordable spots in Manhattan, a borough where the average apartment price hit $2m last year. \u201cThe rents might go up a bit but it\u2019ll bring way more customers to the restaurants on Second Avenue,\u201d said Pam Miller, who was riding the Q with her son, Ben. Makeup artist Toby Klinger, 36, said the extension would make the area more livable. \u201cI\u2019ve been living on Second Avenue almost my whole life and we\u2019re already seeing rapid gentrification,\u201d she said. Klinger rejected the notion that with the help of the new line and the planned closure and renovation of the L train to Brooklyn, the Upper East Side might become a new Williamsburg \u2013 home to a surging population of millennials in hipster uniform. \u201cI like being the only hipster,\u201d said Klinger. \u201cIt used to be a very diverse neighbourhood with a mixture of white, black, Latino and Arab families, and it\u2019s becoming a place for young professionals to dock their iPhones. The character of the neighbourhood is changing completely.\u201d Alan Behr, a lawyer, said the opening would allow a far easier commute to Midtown. The construction of the line had already changed the neighbourhood, he said, with local stores losing business as a result of the disruption. Behr, 62, doubted the new line would lead to a rapid transformation. \u201cThe Upper East Side is a much quieter neighborhood than downtown,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a woman was killed in a hit and run at 10.30 at night, nobody saw it because everyone was asleep. \u201cBut in New York, when you can get from here to there, it\u2019s always a pro. Anything that gets mass transit running faster is a good. The prices may go up but at least we\u2019re going faster. This is our first new foray into mass transit, and that\u2019s important for us.\u201d Amid the positivity, there were some dissenting voices. Bienvenida Rodriguez, who said she had lived in the neighbourhood for 37 years, said the construction had been \u201cnoisy and scary\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had explosions,\u201d she said, \u201csometimes we had no water. It\u2019s been rough for the people living here. I hope now it won\u2019t be dangerous but I\u2019m afraid the homeless will come here now. So we\u2019re praying for the best.\u201d Other passengers, however, noted that the new stations were a vast improvement on the city\u2019s existing stations, many of which date to the early 20th century. The new stations feature striking artwork. At 96th Street, the transportation authority commissioned Sarah Sze, who represented the US at the Venice Biennale in 2013. Her new works use the intense blue of Spanish pottery. At 86th Street, Chuck Close has created 12 large-scale portraits of subjects including composer Philip Glass, the late Lou Reed and three other painters, Cecily Brown, Alex Katz and Kara Walker. Elsewhere, there is work by Vik Muniz, Jean Shin, Zhang Huan and Sienna Shields. \u201cIt\u2019s fabulous,\u201d said another passenger, Lauren Michaels. \u201cThe trains are bright, the concourse is clean and I\u2019ve been reading about the artwork, which looks pretty interesting. \u201cI like the way they chose a different artist for each station, and actually doing art. Let\u2019s see how it wears.\u201d More than2,000 people worked on the extension, tunneling through granite and digging through sand and mud. The line is also meant to run north through Harlem and ultimately into the Bronx but no date has been set for that phase of construction. \u201cThis was a long time coming,\u201d noted Cuomo as the first train pulled out. Disembarking at 86th Street, the governor offered a jovial assessment of his trip. \u201cThere\u2019s no steering wheel and no brakes so it was a good thing they wouldn\u2019t let me drive,\u201d said Cuomo, who is reported to be eyeing a 2020 presidential run against another prominent New Yorker, Donald Trump. \u201cI was along for the ride. It was the first ride and it was a great one.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
