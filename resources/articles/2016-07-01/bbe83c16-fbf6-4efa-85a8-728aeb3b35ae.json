At an appearance in Philadelphia ahead of the Democratic convention, which begins in the city on Monday, he added: \u201cThe DNC was tipping the scale the entire time for Hillary Clinton.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s events show really what an uphill climb the Democrats are facing this week in unifying their party,\u201d he said. \u201cStarting out the week by losing your party chairman over longstanding bitterness between factions is no way to keep something together.\u201d While Priebus acknowledged that both parties were struggling to achieve unity over their chosen nominee, he added that success was defined by \u201chow you lead and how you bring things together through times that aren\u2019t the easiest\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not sitting here believing that the DNC was impartial,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWe knew they weren\u2019t and [the leak] just was a dramatic illustration of what we knew the truth was the whole time anyway.\u201d The RNC chair also took aim at Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator who was chosen on Friday to be Clinton\u2019s running mate. \u201cHillary Clinton showed her true colors,\u201d he said, arguing that she had chosen a centrist Democrat after a year spent of overtures to progressives, particularly those who supported Sanders in the primary. He called the decision \u201cthe furthest thing from an olive branch to Democrats who are fed up with a system that doesn\u2019t work for them.\u201d \u201cThe problems that Democrats have are ideological and the extreme left will not be satisfied by one person\u2019s resignation,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s campaign chair, Paul Manafort, also chimed in on Kaine, telling reporters \u201cthe choice becomes even more clear as a result\u201d. Both Clinton and Kaine, he said, were career politicians \u201cwho have been a part of government most of their lives\u201d \u2013 as opposed to Trump, whom Manafort had proudly labelled an \u201coutsider\u201d during a talk show appearance that morning. Manafort did not comment on the turmoil affecting the DNC, other than to rebuke the Clinton campaign\u2019s suggestion that the Russian government was behind the leaks in a bid to help Trump. Instead, he took a shot at Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state, to claim she had compromised national security. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty desperate pretty quickly,\u201d Manafort said. \u201cIt\u2019s a far reach. Obviously we don\u2019t know who\u2019s behind the leaks. The leaks of this week put the DNC at risk, but the potential leaks of Mrs Clinton\u2019s server sitting unprotected in her home certainly created greater risk than what the DNC did.\u201d He added: \u201cYou can be sure that if they\u2019re able to hack the DNC, the Clinton server was hacked as well and those state secrets are sitting somewhere if not many places around the world.\u201d Priebus said the RNC took every precaution to secure its own email servers and data. \u201cSure, we would be concerned about any foreign government that would be able to break into email servers,\u201d he said, before criticizing the DNC\u2019s conduct once more. \u201cYou don\u2019t say stupid things on email either and send it around staffers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou use your head a little bit. Obviously, not only were these guys tipping the scales, but they were dumb enough to actually do things like that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
