As the standard bearer of France's republican tradition he oversees an impressive parade on Bastille Day. Horseguards, soldiers, pilots, police officers and firemen will march down the Champs Elys\u00e9es accompanied by as much hardware - tanks, rocket launchers and fighter jets - as France's military might can muster. But, even in his Bastille Day best, Mr Chirac cannot ignore the fact that France is deeply fed up, and with him above all. The latest poll shows that only 32% of French people have confidence in the president, while the Parisien newspaper said this year's July 14 celebrations \"smell like the end of Chirac's reign\". That France is not in the mood to party is clear. But this is more than a nation in economic and political depression. It is a crisis that some analysts believe could turn violent. Commentators evoke May 1968, when students rioted through the streets of Paris setting up barricades and tearing up paving stones to hurl at the police. Everyone got angry, went on strike and then went back to work or study. It did not change much, but it remains a seminal moment of that generation. Many believe France has another crisis coming. For 30 years the country ignored warnings that its system needed an overhaul, that it could not sustain its massive public expenditure, enormous bureaucracy, expensive public services, high taxes and crippling social charges. Paradoxically, French people often say they want changes, and then bring the streets to a standstill when their politicians try to introduce them. Instead of pressing ahead with difficult reforms, ministers have all too often taken the soft option of retreating. \"The French do not change things by consensus, they change things by conflict,\" said Pascal Perrineau, a professor at the Paris Institute for Political Science. \"The French model is no longer accepted as universal because it doesn't work. The French are at a crossroads. They know they must change and adapt to a more liberal, global world, but they are hesitating and it may well be that they need a push. From time to time a man of history, like Bonaparte and de Gaulle, comes to force us to accept change, but we have a revolutionary history which makes this period particularly risky.\" But what exactly is wrong? Why is the home of a 35-hour working week, long holidays, generous benefits, fine gastronomy and TGVs riddled with self-doubt? Rejection of the European constitution by French voters in May, and the failure of Paris to secure the 2012 Olympic Games hit the country hard. Accusations that London had \"cheated\" led to more self-flagellation: \"We don't even know how to lose gracefully,\" said a morose Frenchman. But the French were already demoralised. The constitution and Olympic failures simply tapped into a deeper malaise about what it means to be French in the 21st century. Mr Chirac personifies this discontent. What, the French ask themselves, has the president ever done for them? Charles de Gaulle restored pride in post-war France, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand left an impressive cultural legacy - the Louvre Pyramid, the National Library, the Bastille Opera house. Sleaze and scandals Mr Chirac will be remembered more for the sleaze and scandals that have mired his decade in power. Bereft of direction, the Chirac presidency will go down as the era of broken promises, or \"words, words, words\" as one analyst put it. Angela Faragasso, who runs a bar in the ethnically mixed area of Menilmontant in Paris, believes the country's problems date from April 21 2002, when French voters put Jean-Marie Le Pen of the Front National into the second round of the presidential election. \"We didn't vote for Chirac because we wanted him as president but because we didn't want the other guy as president. It wasn't a real choice,\" she said. Most people were horrified by Mr Le Pen's success, but many voted for the extreme right and left in the first round \"to make a point\", to give the political elite a good kicking. Instead it was an unrivalled example of shooting yourself in the foot. Mr Chirac made fighting unemployment a mainstay of his manifesto, but one in 10 of the population is unemployed while an estimated quarter of all youngsters are jobless. The celebrated but hugely expensive health service is almost bankrupt. Farmers complain they are being squeezed out by unreasonable and incomprehensible demands. Small busi nesses say there is no incentive to succeed. Isabelle Coulet, 45, who recently set up AIM, a film production company, says employing staff in France is out of the question when social charges mean paying another 60% of an employee's salary to the state. \"I'm French and I want to stay in France so I pay my taxes and charges and I'm hyper-honest about it. But I can understand why people cheat or go abroad. The current situation in France is catastrophic,\" she said. The gloom and scepticism is worsened by a sense that the political elite clings to power and privileges with scant regard for ordinary voters. This was highlighted by recent scandals over luxury grace and favour apartments given to politicians and civil servants. St\u00e9phane Rozes, assistant director of French opinion pollsters CSA, said: \"The French look to their leaders to take control, but in the last few years they've done nothing but pass the buck. They say it's not our fault, it's because of Brussels or globalisation or whatever. People feel the politicians enjoy privileged positions but refuse to assume their responsibilities.\" Mr Rozes said polls indicated they would accept change if it was of general benefit \"but not if it's for individual profit\". Aziz Senni, 28, who runs his own taxi firm in the suburbs of Paris, is a Frenchman of Moroccan origin who employs around 80 drivers.\"I'd certainly take on more but I can't afford to. For every euro they get in their pay packet I have to pay another euro to the state. \"Unemployment is the biggest problem especially among youngsters from immigr\u00e9 families. These young people find their olive skin a real handicap here and a lot of them don't have much hope of getting jobs.That's why people like me start up our own businesses.\" The sense of crisis has seeped out of the corridors of power, through the cities and towns into \"la France profonde\", where France's famously strident farmers also feel unloved. Rural heritage \"Nobody seems to give a hoot if we produce anything or not. In fact they're prepared to pay us not to produce anything,\" said dairy farmer Fran\u00e7ois Fihue. \"We're proud of our work and don't want to be paid for not doing anything. We just don't know what French society, what French people, want from us. They go on about France's agricultural and rural heritage, then they sue us because the cock crows too early or the tractor makes too much noise or our farms are too smelly.\" It is hard to find anyone feeling cheerful. Rebecca Martin, a 25-year-old former Sorbonne student from Britanny, said she and her student friends were pessimistic about their job prospects.\"There's a growing feeling that there's no point studying because you won't get the job you want. I shouldn't say it but the French are basically lazy. They want to get paid more for fewer hours and keep their benefits and jobs but they don't want to work.\" Three years ago Maxime Brunerie, described as \"emotionally disturbed and with neo-Nazi links\", took a pot-shot at Mr Chirac as he was reviewing the troops on Bastille Day. This year with another 22 months of his mandate to run he has been fending off political snipers - many of them from his own ranks - even before the ceremony begins.\"Chirac is weak and Chirac has weakened France,\" said Richard Liscia, director of the health industry newspaper, Le Quotidien de M\u00e9decin. \"When France voted \"non\" to the constitution they voted for a question that wasn't asked: Do you like Chirac?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
