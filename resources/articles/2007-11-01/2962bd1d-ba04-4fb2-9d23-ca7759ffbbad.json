The giant peccary, twice as heavy as related species living locally, was identified after skins and bones of animals killed by hunters were spotted by a Dutch biologist. The animal has been seen along the banks of the Aripuana river but conservationists think it may already be endangered as illegal logging and gravel extraction is ruining its habitat. The Tupi tribe call the pig \"caitetu munde\", meaning \"great peccary which lives in pairs\". Now classified by scientists as Pecari maximus, the animal was identified by Marc van Roosmalen, who is based at the National Institute for Amazon Research, in Manaus. He filmed a herd in March 2003. Aside from its size, the peccary differs from three better-known relatives - the white-lipped, collared and Chaccoan peccaries - through not moving about in large herds. It also only eats fruit from the ground and does not dig up roots. In the journal Bonner Zoologische Beitrage, the biologist and his colleagues write: \"Pecari maximus walks silently through ... [dense climax forest] in small family groups.\" They warn of \"commercial hunters\" using the pig to feed hungry settlers, and say that due also to its limited distribution it should be placed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
