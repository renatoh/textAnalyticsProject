Officials from the Football Association lodged a complaint with the governing body after Ashley Cole and Emile Heskey were subjected to racist chants from a large section of the home crowd throughout the match. Uefa will also examine security arrangements in Slovakia which failed to prevent running battles before and during the match between supporters and riot police. Violence broke out in the stadium during the first half after missiles were thrown into the English section and some of the visiting fans tried to rip down a thin fence dividing them from Slovak supporters. On Friday evening two England fans were shot as security guards in a city centre bar fired warning shots to clear England supporters. Gareth Jones, 30, from Coventry, had a bullet removed from his neck in hospital yesterday, and Phil Holland, from Worcester, was shot in the knee but discharged himself from hospital. Two security men were arrested and detained in connection with the incident. The FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said: \"The racism is very disappointing. Throughout the game Emile Heskey and Ashley Cole, in particular, suffered a torrent of racist abuse whenever they got the ball and they deserve credit for the way they conducted themselves throughout that.\" Heskey described the abuse as the worst he had encountered. \"It wasn't just a few people it was the whole stadium,\" he said. \"It was very hard but we just tried to block it out.\" The referee Domenico Messina referred to the abuse and the violence in his match report and Uefa will be under pressure to take firm action. Last week PSV Eindhoven were fined just \u20ac15,000 (\u00a39,500) after their supporters abused Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord during a Champions League match, a decision understood to be under review. \"Uefa utterly deplores any form of racism,\" said Mike Lee, Uefa communications director. \"We are appalled at what appears to have occurred against England last night.\" One sanction thought to be under consideration is banning Slovakian supporters from attending the return match next year. Referring to the violence, Lee said: \"There were some ugly scenes but we need to look at exactly what went on and we cannot prejudge.\" The disorder came as England played their first competitive match since the summer World Cup in Japan and South Korea, during which supporters were praised for their good behaviour. Paul Newman, the FA's head of communications, said some of the tactics employed by the police were \"inappropriate\", but events in Bratislava appeared to confirm fears that the violence associated with English supporters will return when the side play in Europe. Saturday night's events will raise fears that the next two major tournaments, Euro 2004 in Portugal and the 2006 World Cup in Germany, will be marred by English hooligans. Some 6,000 England fans, 4,300 of whom had tickets, made the trip to Bratislava for the game and many seemed intent on trouble. They found locals happy to respond to their attempts at intimidation. The tone was set on Friday night as rival groups of supporters fought running battles in the streets. The England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson witnessed some of the violence from his hotel room window and heard the shooting. \"I heard shots and I thought it was fireworks,\" he said yesterday. \"I looked out of the window and it was like the wild west. \"I understand fans from both England and Slovakia were involved in fighting but I did not know exactly what was happening. \"I saw 50 or 60 police running into McDonald's and then 'boom'.\" There was also trouble elsewhere in Europe as fans made their way to and from the game. Ten England fans were arrested in Prague after a dispute over a bill in a lap-dancing club. In Vienna yesterday five English people were arrested after they smashed cars and shop windows. Some 1,200 known troublemakers were issued with banning orders prior to the match and 12 England fans were turned back from various British ports and airports at the weekend while four were refused entry to Prague. Mark Steels, a spokesman for the National Criminal Intelligence Service said yesterday: \"That does show that there are still a small minority travelling with England who are happy to get involved in trouble.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
