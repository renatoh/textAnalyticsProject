I love working with people - knowing the patients throughout their lives and working with a good team. About 50% of my patients are English or Irish and the rest are from other ethnic backgrounds. The number of refugees goes up all the time. We have a constant stream and it makes life interesting as well as challenging. Since last year, the chief frustration has been getting locums and nursing staff. It is so difficult for nurses to live in London. There are no locums available for love nor money and that is frustrating when you're in a two-doctor practice as we are. I suspect it is due to levels of disenchantment and the age of GPs generally. Many doctors decide to do something else and not to jump through hoops for the government or health authority or anyone else. The paperwork isn't any worse. The government's new contract is our current concern - there is uncertainty about what it is going to mean. More financial resources will be available but this may not translate into more help in inner London. I've just had my first patient who has been offered a private place alternative to the NHS: he has been on a waiting list for a bypass graft for five months and has just been given a list of nine alternative hospital places including six private places. This means services offered privately but paid for with NHS funding. I am concerned over issues of accountability and follow up but guess it is progress in our pressured healthcare system. You get the impression that there are fewer doctors available to work. There is a local project to get refugee doctors up to speed by having them follow British doctors at work. The thing is to not allow standards to drop. Despite the challenges, I continue to love my job. Public voices: March 21 2002 GP, north London Salary: c. \u00a355,000 I enjoy my work in the local community and feel privileged in the respect I receive. A lot of my time is still taken up with paperwork though and I feel that my time could often be better used. Increasingly I also find myself doing advice work, especially with people who have arrived in the country recently and need to talk to someone they trust about issues like benefits and housing. This is very satisfying and my patients appreciate the help I give them. A GP does have an important role to play as the patient's advocate but it does mean I have less time to spend with people with medical conditions who need lot of attention. I feel very frustrated at the shortage of doctors and nurses in the London area. This leads to unacceptable delays in seeing patients - I would guess that the 10-day wait to see a doctor at our surgery is not unusual for the area. At the moment I feel ambivalent about the government using private services to treat NHS patients. I think the problem lies with adequate follow up of patients and accountability, although straight forward operations like hip replacements and cataract removal could probably be performed by private hospitals for the NHS. There is also a need for a public re-education programme which aims to make people aware of the kinds of problems that a GP and a practice nurse can realistically deal with. An example of the kind of things that patients misunderstand is how antibiotics work and how long they will take to have any effect. All too often people will come back to the surgery or go to casualty prematurely. This clogs up the system and drains it further. Despite all of these frustrations, I still enjoy my work a great deal and feel happy that I can contribute to society. Lou Alexander The Common Good: March 21 2001 GP, north London Salary: c.\u00a350,000 Most of the time I enjoy my work very much. Unfortunately though, like a lot of public service workers these days, I spend too much of my time doing paperwork when I should be attending to patients. This can be very frustrating, especially when you take a lot of pride in your work. Keeping up with everything and trying to be really useful to your patients can be extremely exhausting - there simply isn't enough time in the day. I do think that to be a public sector worker, you need to have a vocation. By this I mean that to be useful and to make a difference to the community is important to me. On the whole I am treated with respect by patients, but I think that a lot of this has to do with the fact that I am a very informal person. I treat everybody equally, and I don't think of myself as more important than my patients. I think this attitude is vital if you are to be successful when working with the general public. I am strongly opposed to private sector medicine and would never work in that area myself. I have come to terms with the fact that some people make the choice to opt for private treatment, but the fact that most people can't make that choice is what keeps me going."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
