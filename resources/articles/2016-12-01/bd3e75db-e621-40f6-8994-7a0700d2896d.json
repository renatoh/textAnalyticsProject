The England head coach has also told the Northampton hooker that there is no guarantee he will hold on the England captaincy following the dismissal and subsequent suspension that will rule him out until 23 January. \u201cDylan will be more disappointed than anyone about what has happened and he has got to cop the penalty because the World Rugby directive on protecting the head is 100% right,\u201d Jones said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. \u201cHe has let down himself, he has let down his club and he has let down his country.\u201d England have won 13 games in a row with Hartley as captain but Jones was far from equivocal about the 30-year-old retaining the armband for the Six Nations, which begins for England on 4 February when France visit Twickenham. \u201cHe is eligible for selection for the Six Nations and it comes down to the case for every selection \u2013 we pick the best 23 and if he is in the best 23, then he has a chance to be captain,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThis is not the last chance for him but he understands that he can\u2019t behave in the way he did.\u201d Hartley received the third red card of his career six minutes after coming on to the field as a replacement for Northampton against Leinster at Franklin\u2019s Gardens this month. The subsequent six-week ban took his career total to 60 weeks of suspensions and means that if he does lead out England against France he will have had only six minutes of competitive rugby in the previous two months. Hartley has a much better disciplinary record for England than Saints but if Jones does decide to replace him as captain, the three main candidates for the role would be Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and Mike Brown.Jones did, though, offer some support to Hartley, telling the Times: \u201cThe thing about Dylan is he loves rugby, he loves playing for his club, playing for his country. Let him pay the penalty and get on with it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
