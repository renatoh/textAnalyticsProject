TO NEGATIVITY Notice how plain women always hang around with absolute boilers? Makes them comparatively beautiful, see. Similarly, the presence of Sunderland in this season's Premiership has made the rest of the league look relatively good. But closer inspection reveals bags under the eyes and pungent BO. We are on course for the first Premiership season in history in which the average number of goals per game will be under two. So is it really surprising that Liverpool and Chelsea have emulated the MU Rowdies by being dumped out of Europe because of their inability to score? Lord Ferg abandoned his club's attacking tradition to fiddle with his formation like a fumbling teenager, while Liverpool and Chelsea ignored proven goalscorers Michael Owen and Hernan Crespo in order to take on the cream of the continent with jumped-up bouncers such as Peter Crouch and Didier Drogba - rich men's versions of Kevin Davies, Mr Em and James Beattie, to name but three other oafs indulged by English clubs. Do you think Portuguese midfielder Tiago rang compatriot Comical Jose last night to offer a further example? \"You flogged me, a creative player, to Lyon for a \u00a31.5m loss and then splurged \u00a324.4m to relieve them of Michael Essien,\" he could have lectured. \"And while that glorified mule missed your Barcelona shambles because of suspension, I delivered a man-of-the-match performance and two silky goals in my new team's 4-0 destruction of PSV.\" Laudable Lyon combine class with adventure, while the top English clubs blend brawn with yawns. The situation is, like the Fiver most Friday nights, scandalous and staggering. Shouldn't Liverpool fans be singing \"You'll never work again\" to a manager who invited Big Cup elimination by dropping his best player in the first leg and trying to scab a 0-0? Is it really acceptable for a team with infinite wealth to try to blag a goal in the Nou Camp by sending on a second-rate centre-back as striker? And, most staggering of all, is the man who's masterminding Lyon's swashbuckling progress the same Ged Houllier who was run out of Anfield two years ago for being narrow-minded and boring? Or is Rafael Benitez that Ged Houllier in disguise? * * * * * * * * * * * * MULTIPLE QUOTES OF THE DAY, IN WHICH PROFESSIONAL NAYSAYER EAMON DUNPHY CONTINUES HIS BATTLE WITH FELLOW RTE ANALYST JOHN GILES FOR THE TITLE OF NARKIEST ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PUNDIT On Liverpool v Benfica: \"It was Ragball Rovers out there with Cisse and Garcia. Look at Cisse - somebody thought he was worth \u00a314m at some stage. He has no left foot and no right; \u00a314m and counting. They bought him a big mansion in Cheshire and now he's no more than a part of the landed gentry. Absolute rubbish.\" On Harry Kewell: \"Fat. And a clown. A fat clown for all to see.\" On Robbie Fowler: \"An overweight has-been. He's got more money than Liverpool.\" On Luis Garcia: \"What do you do with him? I'll tell you what to do with him: put him in a bin where he belongs.\" On Jose Mourinho: \"He's a bluffer who just got found out. He will never be at the tactical level of Milan or Barcelona, he doesn't even have the footballing intelligence to know why Barca beat him. Look at his claims that the best team didn't win. Ridiculous. He's a Bengal lancer.\" ********************* SAVE YOUR LOVE FOR ROME AND FOR ME If you're a Middlesbrough-based Fiver reader who's today seen dozens of bemused-looking Italians asking: \"Where is-a the three-starred Michelin ristorante?\" and staring blankly at the smog-encrusted streets - don't worry, there's an explanation. They've been duped. You see the Middlesbrough tourist centre (yes, such a thing exists) has told them that: \"Whether you're craving designer bargains, gastronomic delights or cultural connections we'd love to welcome you to absolutely fabulous Middlesbrough!\" The lies, sadly, don't end there. For Roma fans who've abandoned the delights of the Vatican, Colosseum, Pantheon, Il Gelato Di San Crispino (the best ice-cream in the world, Mark Viduka take note) and ancient ruins, have been told the local attractions include 'Middlesborough town centre' - a place so grotty it makes Luton's Arndale look classy - as well as Darlington Railway, in Darlington, and the museum in Hartlepool, in, er, Hartlepool. Still, at least Boro boss Steve \"I'm suspicious of that word 'entertainment'\"McClaren remains 100% honest ahead of tonight's Euro Vase fourth-round clash. For despite facing a Roman legion more depleted than at any time since the Battle of Antinople (Francesco Totti, Vincenzo Montella, Doni, Daniele De Rossi and Shabani Nonda are all out), McClaren is promising to stick with his tried-and-tedious 4-5-1 formation. \"If we can stop them scoring here it will give us a great chance,\" he chuckled. \"Keep a clean sheet in the first leg and you've got a good chance in the second.\" The Fiver's advice? Have a hefty wager on nil-nil. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Internazionale head honcho Massimo Moratti has marked the club's 98th birthday by linking them with Thierry Henry. Michael Carrick is Lord Ferg's top MU Rowdies summer target. Paul Le Guen's first job as Pope's O'Rangers manager will be to lure Lyon keeper Gregory Coupet to the club. Barcelona will underline the quality of their squad by flogging forgotten man Javier Saviola to Atletico Madrid. And Luton boss Mike Newell has been spotted playing golf with Freddy Shepherd after Alan Shearer told the Jongleurs FC big cheese to make him the club's next manager. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF The Pope's O'Rangers have agreed a \u00a348m deal with JJB Sports to retail the club's branded sports and leisurewear in their stores across the UK for the next 10 years. A matter of days after signing for Tamworth, Paul Merson has decided to retire from football. That's one thing he's managed to quit then. Andy Cole faces another three weeks on the Manchester City sidelines with knee knack. Construction work on Brighton's new stadium at Falmer has been put back by a year after Lewes County Council lodged a legal challenge. \"How can they say they have the best interests of the community at heart?\" blasted Seagulls chief executive Martin Perry. Former German international Steffen Effenberg has joined the chorus of calls for national coach Jurgen Klinsmann's head. \"If I was in charge, then I would get rid of Klinsmann right away,\" he sniffed. \"The rest of the world is laughing at us.\" Spanish sports minister Jaime Lissavetsky has vowed to introduce tougher legislation to deal with racist fans. \"The government is preparing changes to the law so that it can act with greater rigour, will be able to hand out heavier sanctions and make individual actions punishable,\" he declared. And Ian Wright is launching a Jamie Oliver-style TV show to improve youngsters' health. Ian Wright's Fitter Kids will see the hapless pundit put eight out-of-shape teenagers through a six-month training programme. * * * * * * * * * * WIN A SAMSUNG D600 PHONE Send your best sporting picture - an English player at Highbury, Freddie Flintoff wetting the baby's head, whatever ... taken with your mobile to the.gallery@observer.co.uk now.

It makes a mockery of the whole competition, if not football itself. I vote we start a campaign now to have one of the lesser teams thrown out to allow the reigning champions of Europe to rightfully take their place in the last eight\" - Nick Fletcher. \"I understand there was a banjo and cow's backside competition in Liverpool last night. Eleven men wearing red shirts have been criticised for wasting the judges' time\" - Eddy McDowall. \"How nice it was to hear DJ Clueless mark Arsenal's Big Cup progress on 606 last night with a one-hour whinge about Liverpool's exit. With EhColinEhMurray preaching the way of the Scouser to all and sundry, is this the start of a London-based, non-Scouse, celebrity DJ, pro-Liverpool, anti-London bias?\" - Dan Rowley. \"Beth McPherson alleged that your publishing of her letter yesterday would enable her to 'make family history'. Perhaps you should print a letter by Bob Geldof so he can do the same to poverty\" - Martyn Shapter. \"So, I go through the hell of a 24-hour bureaucratic nightmare trip at the receiving end of hundreds of years of Middle East conflict (Tuesday's TV and radio) and Andy Korman bags a prize for poking fun at me from the comfort of his no-doubt posh surroundings (Wednesday's letters).
