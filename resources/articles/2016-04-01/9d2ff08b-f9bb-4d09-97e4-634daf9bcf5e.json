The ad comes as a survey revealed 93% of the Great Barrier Reef was affected by the bleaching. That finding motivated the Queensland government to call on the federal government to convene an urgent meeting of the nation\u2019s environment ministers to talk about measures to address climate change in light of bleaching. Organised by the Climate Council, the full page ad in the Courier Mail on Thursday contains an open letter signed by 56 scientists. \u201cOne of the reasons we placed the ad in the Courier Mail was that we\u2019ve seen very little coverage of the coral bleaching event in that paper and in fact there was a front-page story that said the coral bleaching event had been wildly exaggerated,\u201d said Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland and one of the signatories of the letter. The letter explains that it is the worst bleaching event in its history, and that it is being driven by climate change. \u201cThe Great Barrier Reef is at a crisis point,\u201d the scientists say. \u201cIts future depends on how much and how quickly the world, including Australia, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit ocean warming.\u201d It then calls for Australia to rapidly phase out coal-fired power stations and for no new coalmines. \u201cThis must be the top priority for Australia if we are to protect what remains of the Great Barrier Reef and other reefs around the world,\u201d they say. Climate Council member and signatory to the letter Lesley Hughes said: \u201cWe are now seeing first-hand the damage that climate change causes, and we have a duty of care to speak out.\u201d On 7 February, the Courier Mail ran a story quoting the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, as saying the reef remained an untouched beauty. His comments were in response to a David Attenborough documentary about the Great Barrier Reef being aired. \u201cThe key point that I had from seeing the first of the three parts is that, clearly, the world\u2019s Great Barrier Reef is still the world\u2019s Great Barrier Reef,\u201d Hunt told the Courier Mail. The story included a subheading that read: \u201cReports of reef\u2019s death greatly exaggerated: Attenborough\u201d. A News Corp Australia spokesman said on Wednesday that the claim there had been very little coverage of coral bleaching in the Courier Mail was \u201cfrankly baffling\u201d. \u201cA quick Google search shows numerous stories have been published including, to highlight just a few, on March 1st, 21st and 30th. And today the paper has covered the issue extensively once again,\u201d he said. \u201cEqually importantly the paper also exposed Greenpeace\u2019s dishonesty in using deceptive imagery on two separate occasions. Such scare campaigns only serve to undermine the efforts to secure the reef\u2019s future.\u201d A story about the 93% bleaching appeared in Thursday\u2019s paper on page 13. The Queensland environment minister, Steven Miles, called for an urgent meeting with Hunt, and said \u201cwe have to move quickly on climate change,\u201d and bemoaned the \u201clack of a coherent effective national policy.\u201d \u201cThe federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, has been downplaying the seriousness of the coral bleaching because he knows the major cause is global warming and we still haven\u2019t seen any meaningful climate change policy from the federal level,\u201d Miles said. The Queensland government itself has been criticised for approving Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine, which would be Australia\u2019s largest coalmine. Federal approval of the mine will be challenged in court this month, on the basis that emissions released when the coal is burned will threaten the Great Barrier Reef."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
