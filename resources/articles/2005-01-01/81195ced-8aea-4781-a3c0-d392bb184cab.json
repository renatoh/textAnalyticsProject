The holiday will include a trip to Kipling camp to see wildlife and also Delhi, Taj Mahal and Jaipur. I want to travel as light as possible. What should I take? Many thanks, Penny Sutton Dear Penny, Although it pains us even to write this sentence, you must take no more than two pairs of shoes: one pair flip flops, one pair trainers. Leave your jeans at home: too hot and stiff and way too touristy. For less than the weight of one pair of Sevens you can pack in two pairs of cotton pyjama trousers (try Knickerbox) which are perfect - cool, comfy, and modest. No combats, ever. Be respectful and sensible - no miniskirts, obviously - and take some loose, long-sleeved cotton tops as well as a couple of vests. However, beware that all this loose floatiness does not lead you into Judi Dench ethnic chic territory. A good rule of thumb is no sequins and no paisley. For night train journeys take a warm hoody, and a pashmina. (If you must wear both at the same time, for heaven's sake make sure no one gets photographic evidence.) Lastly, leave your Chanel handbag at home - the bag you'll need (as well as your main rucksack) is a shoulder bag that closes with a zip (this is essential) and is big enough for book, passport, aforementioned hoody, bottle of water. Herve Chapelier (available at Selfridges) have a good range of nylon zip bags that are comfortable, weigh nothing, and add a little French je ne sais quoi. Happy travelling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
