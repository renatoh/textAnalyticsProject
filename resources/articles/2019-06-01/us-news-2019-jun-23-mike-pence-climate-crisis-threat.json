Tapper responded: \u201cThe science says it is.\u201d Pence said: \u201cBut what we won\u2019t do, and the Clean Power Plan was all about that, was hamstringing energy in this country, raising the cost of utility rates for working families across this country.\u201d Tapper interjected: \u201cBut is it a threat?\u201d Pence did not answer the interjection, complaining instead that \u201cother nations like China and India absolutely do nothing or make illusory promises decades down the road\u201d. He also praised US focus on natural gas and \u201cclean coal technology\u201d. Tapper persevered: \u201cBut is what people are calling a climate emergency, is it a threat? Do you think it is a threat, manmade climate emergency is a threat?\u201d Pence said: \u201cI think the answer to [that] is going to be based upon the science.\u201d Tapper insisted \u201cthe science says yes\u201d and told the vice-president \u201cthe science community in your own administration, at [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] at the [Director of National Intelligence], they all say it is a threat \u2026 but you won\u2019t, for some reason.\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d said Pence. \u201cWhat the president has said, what we have said is that we\u2019re not going to raise utility rates.\u201d Tapper persisted: \u201cBut is it not a threat?\u201d Pence criticised the Clean Power Plan, the Obama-era rule which the Environmental Protection Agency rolled back on Wednesday, thereby relaxing controls on carbon dioxide admissions from coal-fired power stations. He also took aim at the Green New Deal, a package of proposed legislation which Democrats including the prominent New York progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez say would boost the US economy while working to reduce the effects of the climate crisis but which Republicans say would be financially ruinous. Tapper tried once more: \u201cOK. So you don\u2019t think it is a threat, is all I\u2019m saying? You don\u2019t think it is a threat?\u201d Pence said: \u201cI think we\u2019re making great progress reducing carbon emissions. America has the cleanest air and water in the world...\u201d Tapper interrupted, laughing: \u201cThat is not true. We don\u2019t have the cleanest air and water in the world. We don\u2019t.\u201d Pence said: \u201cOK.\u201d Tapper asked him to \u201cget back to me with some statistics that show it\u201d. Pence could have reached for the Environmental Performance Index, a joint initiative of Yale and Columbia universities and the World Economic Forum which does in fact rank the US joint-first in the world on drinking water. However, it also places America 10th in the world for air quality and 29th for water and sanitation combined. Pence insisted the Trump administration was \u201cmaking progress on reducing carbon emissions. We\u2019re doing it through technology, through natural gas, through continuing to support \u2026 nuclear energy, clean energy. \u201cThe answer, though, is not to raise the utility rates of millions of utility rate payers across the country.\u201d Tapper finally gave up, and asked about Russian election interference instead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
