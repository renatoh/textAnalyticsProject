Lying ill in bed at the age of 16, he opened a copy of Harpers &amp; Queen he had borrowed from his mother, and the world tilted on its axis. \u201cThat first couple of hours with a glossy changed my life,\u201d he writes in his new memoir. \u201cI was mesmerised.\u201d He loved it all \u2013 the writing, the pictures, even the \u201cgentle waft\u201d of fragrance that emanated from the advertisers\u2019 scent strips \u2013 and in a heartbeat he knew that it was in this world he wanted to make his career. Even as he was still in his pyjamas, he was scribbling an article. It was called How to Survive Teenage Parties \u2013 a piece that, he says now, sought to define the different kinds of people you would meet at groovy gatherings on \u201cthe wild frontier\u201d between Sussex, where his family had a house, and Hampshire. In the long years since, little has changed. The love affair continues. Coleridge will finally leave Vogue House, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s London HQ, at the end of this year, when he retires as chairman of the company. But he remains fully in thrall to magazines. Yes, many of them are in serious trouble (soon after we meet, it\u2019s announced that Marie Claire is to close its UK print edition after 31 years). Yes, their budgets are vastly smaller than in the glory days (Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of Vogue, GQ and House &amp; Garden, has only just crept back into the black, after posting a loss of \u00a313.6m in 2017). But, he insists, they are not dead yet \u2013 and nor have they become boring, whatever I might think (to me, they seem like catalogues now, lacking the wit and drama that I too once loved). \u201cI was just reading World of Interiors,\u201d he says. \u201cThe new one had come up [to my office], and I was turning the pages, and I found it constantly exciting.\u201d I look at his face \u2013 it is ever smiling, though his grin undeniably has something of the assassin about it \u2013 trying to work out if he really means this. Is it possible for a man of his age and experience (or for anyone at all) truly to find sofas and pelmets constantly exciting? But I see no sign of irony, no hint of pretence. The World of Interiors in question now sits on a nearby ottoman, and judging by his body language it\u2019s all he can do not to leap out of his seat and begin flicking through it again this very second. Coleridge and I meet at his house in Chelsea: a stuccoed terrace in one of London\u2019s smartest streets (his neighbour is Richard Rogers; his corner shop is Peter Jones). The interior is pale and \u2013 to my untutored eyes \u2013 sort of Oka-ish, with top notes of Rajasthan (Coleridge loves India more than any other country, and some of his collection of Indian miniatures are arranged in a pyramid shape above the fireplace). On this sunny, early autumn afternoon, he is in a slightly skittish mood \u2013 and not only because he has a book \u2013 The Glossy Years \u2013 coming out, something that is \u201crather nerve-racking\u201d. Earlier today, at the House of Commons, he saw Boris Johnson\u2019s first performance at prime minister\u2019s questions, and listened to Sajid Javid\u2019s spending review (as chairman of the board of trustees at the V&amp;A, he was happy indeed to hear that museums are in for a small rise). \u201cAll I could see from my seat was his blond hair,\u201d he says, somewhat wonderingly. \u201cAnd then, in front of me, was Jeremy Corbyn\u2026\u201d And how, since he has brought it up, does he feel about politics at the moment? Coleridge went to Eton and, as he notes in his book, not only are about a quarter of his closest friends Old Etonians; their networks are \u201cas deep and pervasive as Japanese knotweed\u201d. Quite a number of those with whom he went to school are involved, to a greater or lesser degree, in the current crisis, from Charles Moore, the former editor of the Daily Telegraph, to Oliver Letwin, one of the Tory MPs who lost the whip after voting against the government earlier this month. Does he have to avoid certain subjects at dinner parties? Yes. \u201cI never now mention the referendum or anything that flows from it. I never mention it at work, either, though I imagine that the majority of my colleagues are remain.\u201d A one nation Tory, he wasn\u2019t an \u201cardent\u201d remainer, though he voted that way in the referendum. His main feeling now is that he wishes there had never been a referendum in the first place. It simply wasn\u2019t necessary: \u201cThings were going well enough.\u201d And what about his privilege? One of the things I like about his book is that even as he gently sends up his background, he never tries to hide it; to pretend that it was anything other than extremely posh. He\u2019s perfectly happy to reveal, for instance, that at the age of five, one of his school friends casually informed him that his father owned an island in the West Indies (this was Mustique, and the boy in question was Charlie Tennant, the son of Princess Margaret\u2019s pal Lord Glenconner). Nor does he mind admitting that when he and two Eton friends decided to travel across Russia to Iran in their gap year, the mother of one of them, who happened to be the Duchess of Buccleuch, organised a weekend at her stately pile at which various distinguished experts were assembled to offer them advice (these experts, he writes, must have been utterly aghast at the boys\u2019 ignorance). Nevertheless, I wonder: is he ever embarrassed to be an Etonian? Especially at this particular moment. \u201cWell, our second son, Freddie, was reading my book at the weekend,\u201d he says, prevaricating madly (he and his wife, Georgia, a healer, have four children \u2013 and, in addition to this place, a grand-sounding house in Worcestershire). \u201cAnd he was struck by how much the world has changed in my lifetime.\u201d He goes on a bit about mobile phones, schools and certain attitudes \u2013 and of course, he and Freddie are right. Things have changed. But then again, they\u2019ve hardly changed at all: Etonians, as I now point out, are still running the country. \u201cWell,\u201d he says again. \u201cAt this precise moment, Etonians are all killing each other, aren\u2019t they? I was at the GQ man of the year awards, and as Rory Stewart [another Old Etonian] was handed his rather ugly, plastic trophy [for politician of the year], he did make the remark that he was expecting to be fired \u2013 and he duly was [by Boris Johnson, also an alumnus of that very expensive school near Windsor].\u201d Seriously, though. What about his privilege? Has he learned to check it? Even Vogue is woke now. For a few seconds, he hesitates. \u201cJournalism is not the same as being a banker or something,\u201d he finally says. His point, I think, is that, as the son of a man whose father was chairman of Lloyd\u2019s, he had no connections in Fleet Street or anywhere else in the media (later, he will email me to emphasise this). \u201cMy parents brought us up comfortably. But we weren\u2019t part of a rich beau monde. Candidly, that was one of the things I loved about magazines. They were a window on another world.\u201d Was he a reluctant memoirist, or an eager one? \u201cNeither, actually. Ed Victor [the late literary agent] rang me and said [he adopts a slow American twang]: \u2018I\u2019ve had this aaw-ffer from Penguin\u2026\u2019 My first thought was that I was too young [he is 62]. Then came a moment of slight vanity. Then I thought: perhaps no one else will ask. I was a freelance writer first, and thus, I\u2019m highly trained never to turn down money for words. So I said yes.\u201d And how did he find it? \u201cIt was immediately interesting.\u201d Things came back to him, though the great worry is that, over time, stories do get a bit tidied up. There may be some acquaintances who do not quite recognise the details on the page. And once his best anecdotes were all in place, of course, there was the agony of it being read. He sent off the manuscript to his first boss, Tina Brown, the former editor of Vanity Fair, the New Yorker and Tatler (where she employed him), in the hope of getting a nice jacket quote out of her. \u201cYou have a pavlovian response to your first boss,\u201d he says. \u201cThey always remain that.\u201d When Brown did praise The Glossy Years, he must have felt a bit as he used to in the old days, when he used to win her over in editorial conferences by punting stories about well-hung dukes, society wives who\u2019d once been escort girls, and particularly unctuous courtiers. After Eton, Coleridge did a stint as a trainee reporter on the comedically named Falmouth Packet, after which he went to Cambridge University where, though ostensibly studying history of art, he enjoyed a regime of \u201cfull-on time wasting\u201d. A dedicated fan of David Bowie, he coloured his hair bright orange, and took lessons from the singer\u2019s mime tutor Lindsay Kemp, in the hope of either meeting his hero, or Kate Bush, in class. During the holidays, he interned at Harpers &amp; Queen, and went travelling with, among others, his friend Craig Brown. These adventures were sometimes grubby (he hitchhiked across eastern Turkey), and sometimes swanky (in Paris, he met the former Diana Mitford, widow of the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley; the thing that sticks in his mind about the encounter was that she told him she used to keep her own hand cream in the ladies\u2019 powder room at Claridge\u2019s). He was awarded something called an aegrotat degree \u2013 this is basically Latin for sick note \u2013 because, having hurt his back in Yazd, in Iran, he was in hospital and unable to sit his exams. The week he left Cambridge he read in the Evening Standard that Tina Brown had been appointed the editor of the ailing Tatler, and he duly wrote to her, asking for a job. His interview took place in the kitchen of the house she shared with her boyfriend (now husband), Harry Evans, the editor of the Sunday Times, where she was busy staring at a load of photographs of the 18th birthday party of the Duke of Rutland\u2019s daughter, Lady Theresa Manners, at Belvoir Castle. \u201cDo you know who any of these chinless characters are?\u201d she asked him. He did. In fact, he\u2019d been at the party himself. \u201cI need a headline,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething snappy.\u201d Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Coleridge did not hesitate. \u201cSaturday Night Belvoir?\u201d he offered. He was hired on the spot, and no wonder: as he points out in his book, just in case the reader is not quite au fait with the correct pronunciation of the Rutlands\u2019 pile, such a headline is a near perfect example of early 80s magazine wit, being both a pun on a well-known movie and potentially \u201cdeliciously\u201d excluding (Belvoir Castle is pronounced \u201cBeaver\u201d). Tatler was fun, and bonkers. Among his tasks was to sell review copies of books to a dealer (the cash was used to pay Julian Barnes, the magazine\u2019s restaurant critic), and to collect, in person, the monthly column of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll. Did he ever ask her about the identity of the headless man (during her divorce from the duke in 1963, a photograph emerged of his wife fellating a man whose face was not shown)? \u201cHa ha ha, no,\u201d he says. But eventually, he moved on, having landed a column in London\u2019s Evening Standard. Writing a column could be terrifying: the search for a good subject every week. Coleridge, though, was creative. Three days before his first column, he had the bright idea of disguising himself as a chauffeur and gatecrashing the party for the drivers of those attending Prince Andrew\u2019s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle. What cunning and guile, I say. \u201cYa! I remember it very well. It was slightly like catacombs. I recall the brickwork, about 100 drivers standing round. You had to work the room without \u2013 ha ha \u2013 drawing too much attention to yourself.\u201d In this period, he lived in Radnor Walk, Chelsea, where \u2013 he says, en passant, in his book \u2013 the actor Rupert Everett was his \u201ccharlady\u201d. Could he tell me more? \u201cWell, he was on the periphery of people I knew. I said I was looking for someone to clean the flat, and he said he would like the \u00a32 an hour.\u201d How lovely, having someone so attractive about the place. \u201cWell, I was at the office! Actually, when I came back, the flat sometimes looked disappointingly much the same as it had when I left.\u201d In 1989, however, he returned to his natural jungle habitat in the form of Harpers &amp; Queen, and by the time he was 29, he was its editor. From there, he was wooed to Cond\u00e9 Nast by Si Newhouse, its billionaire owner, to become the editorial director of its British company (later, he would become its managing director, and after that, the president of Cond\u00e9 Nast International). Did he have pangs, putting his own journalism aside? Did he miss his byline? \u201cThe books were a great substitute,\u201d he says (he has written many novels, as well as nonfiction). Life was, in any case, very good. For instance, his Cond\u00e9 Nast \u201ctraining\u201d in New York, when he became managing director, basically turned out to be an enjoyable stay at the Pierre hotel, and a series of lunches at the Four Seasons. Looking back, does he think all that spending was misguided? If these companies had known what strife lay ahead would they still have convinced themselves that it was, for instance, basically fine for Isabella Blow, the fashion director of Tatler, to take a black cab from Liverpool to London (she didn\u2019t realise there was a train station in Liverpool)? A brief silence. \u201cI think there are lots of strands to this. Vogue is very expensive to produce \u2013 but so much of the work [the photography] that has been done in magazines over the past four decades is so important. It is true art. It will be the focus of retrospectives in museums for years to come.\u201d All the same, people were, I think, too easily dazzled and distracted then \u2013 though in the case of Blow, it\u2019s hardly surprising. She once sat next to Coleridge at dinner wearing a burqa topped with a pair of stag\u2019s antlers. Perhaps, though, the Blows of this world were more up his street than, say, Princess Diana, who liked to pop into Vogue House for lunch, having tipped off the paps first: though he believed HRH looked fabulous at the time, and he was thrilled to the point of breathlessness when she asked him if her breasts were too small, he thinks now that \u201cher blue suit with gold buttons had something of an Aeroflot air stewardess about it\u201d. On the sly, he is quite the bohemian. Can magazines really survive in the digital age? He is determined that, at the top end of the market, they will. There is, he says, no better way for a company like Chanel to communicate with its select group of customers than via the pages of Vogue \u2013 and for these customers, in turn, Vogue is just \u201cpart of the kit, like Horse &amp; Hound in a groom\u2019s yard\u201d. And is Cond\u00e9 Nast finally becoming more egalitarian now? In the old days, those seeking a job there used to be required to give details, on paper, of any private income they had. (Cond\u00e9 Nast salaries being what they were, it was often said that you could only afford to work there if you were privately well off.) Though he rather shoots himself in the foot by telling me a long story about a woman who turned down a \u00a310,000 pay rise at another company simply for the kudos of remaining at Vogue, he insists that things have changed. \u201cAt GQ and Wired we took on people from all over the place. At Vogue, half the staff at least have just come from\u2026.\u201d He corrects himself. \u201cNot just come from\u2026 from fashion college.\u201d Will he grieve when he leaves Vogue House for the last time? Will he miss the cast of characters that daily enter the building via the famous revolving door in which a dachshund called Alan Plumptre, the beloved pet of a staff member, was brutally crushed to death? \u201cNo. I have worked towards retirement in stages \u2013 and also, there is a feeling that people sometimes outstay their welcome. By the time they go, everyone resents them. It has been magically lucky that the curve of growth in magazines matched my working life\u2026\u201d But? I wait, but no qualifier is forthcoming. In his chair by the window, the late afternoon sun falls on Coleridge\u2019s shiny head like a blessing. The Glossy Years by Nicholas Coleridge is published by Penguin (\u00a325).
