But in a sparkling first six days of this competition most teams have been going for the equivalent of a quick checkmate, the attacking play driven along by rule changes and what appears to be a narrowing of the divide between the superpowers and the emerging nations. Fifa's president Sepp Blatter, perhaps not the most impartial witness, has described the opening round of 16 games, which produced 46 goals, as \"full of football at its best and highest level\". Goal ratios are the only statistics worth a light and in Korea and Japan those first games joyously average out at 2.88 goals a match, the best since Sweden's 3.6 in 1958. Blatter, like his predecessor Joao Havelange, has attracted criticism for his determination to widen football's pyramid base, not least because both men have also used it as a way of increasing their own power. But the policy, however tainted in conception, finally seems to be bearing fruit. If it has not yet delivered a sport in which all teams are equal, the dilution of standards has been slowed considerably and many would argue that the developing nations have enriched the mix. The hosts, South Korea and Japan, are in only the foothills of true parity. But they and the rest of the world will be encouraged by their performances this week and by the United States' 3-2 victory over Portugal, in a way more astonishing than Senegal's first-day triumph over the holders France. An early defeat for the champions is always a healthy beginning to a sporting event. But its memory has paled since and even Brazil's first match, traditionally heralded as the start of the competition proper and scintillating though it was at times, did not so much set the tournament alight as live up to the standards already set. If Senegal took to the World Cup like a duck to soup, it has been a long and winding road to Damascus for South Korea, who finally managed their first finals victory in their sixth World Cup. But their experi ence may help other young nations to cut the journey time. China, finals virgins until a few days ago, played some pretty football before the occasion - and Costa Rica - got the better of them. And we now consider the likes of Nigeria and Cameroon as much a part of the occasion as Germany, Italy or Brazil. If the spirit of adventure continues, this World Cup may be the first since Switzerland 1954 without a 0-0 draw in the group phase. It can never, of course, hope to emulate 1954's goalscoring - 140 in 25 matches - but only 16 nations competed then, a time when goals, and wins, were cheap. South Korea were thrashed 9-0 by the Puskas-inspired Hungary and 7-0 by Turkey, and Austria v Switzerland gave us the highest-scoring match in World Cup history, a 7-5 victory for the Austrians in the quarter-final. Most fans had low expectations this time. But the football so far has revised opinions drastically. Pre-breakfast kick-offs did not augur well for viewing figures but the standard of play has also provided a boost for TV executives. About 500m people watched France-Senegal and in Japan, where a top show normally commands a 20% audience share, an estimated 58.8% of Tokyo residents tuned in for their country's opening game. England's game against Sweden brought in 12.6m viewers, and Brazil managed 90% for their side's opener. Most encouraging of all is the fact that players have now adjusted their mentality to take account of three points for a win, this being only the third World Cup since the system was changed. The extra point has already invigorated play in national leagues as well as the Champions League. Away teams seek to score rather than prevent opponents from scoring, and there is now a similarly uplifting effect on the biggest stage. One senses, too, that players are fed up submitting to the fear of failure which has subjected them to too many World Cup penalty shootouts, most notoriously in Italy in 1990 when both semi-finals were decided by spot kicks. Brazil's triumph in 1994 was similarly tainted, the final remembered only as the first to be decided by a shootout. This tournament, however, is shaping up to be the most attractive since Mexico 1986, when Maradona was in his pomp, although even that one did not boast quite such rich fare in the opening games. Even the sight of empty seats at some of this year's matches has not dented the atmosphere or the attraction, because on the field, where it matters most, there has hardly been space to breathe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
