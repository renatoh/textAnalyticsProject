The film has the support of Pratchett\u2019s estate, and is produced in association with Narrativia, Pratchett\u2019s production company. This sits in contrast to BBC America and BBC Studios\u2019 forthcoming adaptation of Pratchett\u2019s books about Ankh-Morpork\u2019s City Watch, The Watch, which Pratchett\u2019s daughter Rhianna Pratchett has said \u201cshares no DNA with my father\u2019s Watch\u201d. The Amazing Maurice was the 28th novel in Pratchett\u2019s Discworld series, but the first written for children. It was also the first novel for which he won a major award, taking the Carnegie medal in 2002. A twist on the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, it follows the story of Maurice, who with a group of talking rats, and a flute-owning boy, Keith, travels from town to town, infesting the streets with rats before charging the citizens to remove them. But when the troupe arrive in the town of Bad Blintz \u2013 so named, according to Maurice, because it has a bath its people are very proud of \u2013 they discover something evil. Sky will release an animated version of the book in 2022, with Laurie as Maurice, Emilia Clarke as Malicia, the daughter of Bad Blintz\u2019s mayor, Himesh Patel as Keith, Gemma Arterton as Peaches, one of the rats, and Hugh Bonneville as the mayor. The film will be co-produced by Sky, Ulysses Filmproduktion and Cantilever Media, with animation studios Studio Rakete and Red Star Animation . \u201cI\u2019m huge fan of Sir Terry Pratchett, so I would not be embarking on this project unless I felt we were bringing the film to life in a way that honours the book and will please its numerous fans around the world,\u201d said Cantilever\u2019s producer and chief executive Andrew Baker. Narrativia\u2019s managing director Rob Wilkins, the late Pratchett\u2019s friend and assistant, said that \u201cbringing Maurice\u2019s story to life was such a joy for Terry\u201d, and expressed his delight that the production companies were \u201chonouring his vision with such reverence and respect\u201d. Pratchett always said that the Carnegie he won for The Amazing Maurice was the prize he was most proud of, despite his numerous awards, degrees and knighthood. Accepting the medal in 2002, the author said he was \u201cdelighted and genuinely shocked \u2026 because Maurice isn\u2019t just fantasy but funny fantasy, too\u201d, and \u201cit\u2019s nice to see humour taken seriously\u201d. \u201cYou can tell that Maurice is a fantasy because it looks like one. It has rats that are intelligent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems to me even more fantastic that in the book there are humans that are intelligent as well. Far more beguiling to me than the idea that evil can be destroyed by throwing a piece of expensive costume jewellery into a volcano [as in Tolkien] is the possibility that peace between nations can be maintained by careful diplomacy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
