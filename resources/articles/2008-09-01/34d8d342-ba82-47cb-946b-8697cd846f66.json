Eden Lake Another gory, edge-of-seat onslaught in the charming British countryside, but by pitting urban pleasure-seekers against disaffected local teens, first-timer James Watkins certainly raises some talking points. Jar City A solid police procedural in the classical tradition, as a tough, weary cop opens cans (or rather jars) of worms in a murder hunt, but the epic Icelandic locations add a distinct local flavour. Tropic Thunder It's been fashionable to knock Ben Stiller's big-budget war-movie satire, but when it's funny it's very funny, with a jaw-dropping cameo by a major Hollywood movie star that must be seen to be believed.
