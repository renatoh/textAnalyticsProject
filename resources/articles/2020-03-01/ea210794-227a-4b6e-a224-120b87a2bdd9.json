The vote on rewriting the country\u2019s Pinochet-era constitution was originally due to take place on 26 April \u2013 a date that the country\u2019s health ministry now predicts will be the height of the virus outbreak in the country. Chile currently has 324 confirmed cases \u2013 the highest number per capita in South America. Lawmakers have provisionally set the new referendum date for 26 October, yet the move still requires formal approval by a two-thirds vote of congress. \u201cThis sends the message that the health of Chileans is our priority,\u201d said \u00c1lvaro Elizalde, president of the opposition socialist party following the announcement. \u201cWe\u2019re confronting a crisis that requires we act responsibly.\u201d A new constitution was a central demand that emerged from protests over inequality last October. The mass demonstrations saw more than 30 killed and thousands injured, as well as billions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage and losses to business. Coronavirus, however, has quickly upended political priorities in Chile. President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era announced a 90-day \u201cstate of catastrophe\u201d to confront the growing outbreak in Chile, which came into effect on Thursday. The move gives the government extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement and assure food supply and basic services. The military is permitted to intervene and uphold order when necessary. Hours later, council workers moved in to remove protest art and sculptures from Santiago\u2019s main square, Plaza Italia, which had been a key staging ground for demonstrations but was gradually abandoned this week as protesters began to comply with quarantine measures. The cleanup operation has provoked outrage. \u201cA significant amount of people might interpret this as a provocation. It is irresponsible \u2013 it could even motivate protesters to go back to the plaza,\u201d said Nico Silva, a social anthropologist who had regularly attended the protests."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
