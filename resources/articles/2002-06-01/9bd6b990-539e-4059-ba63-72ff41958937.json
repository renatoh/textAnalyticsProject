The buzz of mobile phones on the returning team coach, the singing in the dressing room and the fist-clenching salutes to the crowd now seem a distant memory. While there was obvious delight at our survival from the \"group of death\", yesterday's 0-0 draw against Nigeria also signalled a time for reflection among the players. As we embarked on our two-hour journey back to Awaji, the attention had already turned to Saturday's opponents, Denmark. Sitting next to Nigel Martyn, we agreed that of the two possible opponents in the next round, Denmark were our favoured choice. We know exactly what we're going to get from them, whereas Senegal remain an unknown quantity. Inconsistent and brilliant in equal measure, the unpredictability that was so apparent against Uruguay makes Senegal awkward opponents at the knock-out stage. Denmark, on the other hand, have a similar mentality to our own, and we know the strengths and weaknesses of their side. Saturday's late kick-off time in Niigata is also a relief, as the heat and humidity for yesterday's game was unbearable at times. We have a set of scales prominently placed in the dressing room and such is the efficiency of our medical team, every player was thoroughly checked over. I was losing close on two litres of fluid per half, and that was par for the course for most of the lads. To counter the weight loss we took on water and isotonic drinks, while the half-time team talk saw a new addition to our perspiration-drenched kit: ice jackets. The physio Gary Lewin handed out what are, in simple terms, white body warmers soaked in iced water. It was a strange sight for a group of players more used to staying warm than cooling down, but the jackets are imperative in such extreme conditions. Owing to the high humidity, sweat does not evaporate on the skin, so the body's cooling system is not as efficient as normal - I was more than happy to play the second half in my jacket. I cannot overstate how much yesterday's conditions hindered a free-flowing game of football. I'd never played in such intense heat and humidity, and my feet were on fire for the remainder of the evening. I'm aware our performance might have been misinterpreted back home as somewhat pedestrian, but the conditions dictated that we had to play within our means. Mr Eriksson made it abundantly clear in our pre-match team talk that he wanted us to go for the win, to approach the game in the same manner as against Argentina, but it was impossible to play with the same verve for the full 90 minutes. Even our opponents were keen to slow the game down at certain stages. Nigeria had their chances, but at no point did I feel we were in trouble. The pace of the game dictated that I could get forward more often, and I even found myself in a goal-scoring position in the first-half. Unfortunately, I tested the ballboys more than the goalkeeper. Ashley Cole mirrored my attacking runs down the left, but for me the most pleasing aspect of the game was the cohesion we again showed defensively. As more games are played we know when to push forward and when to hold, and when you've got Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell barking out instructions, there is a calm assurance within the ranks. Rio caught the eye again yesterday, and having trained with him every day for the past year, I have no doubt he can become the best in the world in his position. He was certainly the centre of attention among the press corps in the tunnel after the game, but his level-headed nature ensures he remains focused on the job in hand. The final whistle was greeted with the calm, professional reaction the performance war ranted. Both teams were happy with the result, and the biggest cheer of the day came back in the dressing room as we learned about Argentina's shock exit from the tournament. Not that we'd wish to add insult to our old adversary's pain, but we are pleased a squad of Argentina's quality is returning home. With France's departure the previous day, it underlines the fact that there are no easy games at this level. And with every departure, our stay is prolonged. Let's hope that remains the case for the foreseeable future. Danny Mills's official website is at www.eworldsports.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
