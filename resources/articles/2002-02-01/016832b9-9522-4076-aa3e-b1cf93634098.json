For a few moments, though, as Florida Pearl picked up the leaders on the home turn in the Hennessy Gold Cup, this horse who has come up short at Cheltenham twice before was the only one on anyone's mind. No horse had ever won four Hennessys, yet as Adrian Maguire lobbed into the straight three wide, seemingly going better than either Alexander Banquet or Rince Ri, Florida Pearl looked a worthy favourite to do just that. But not for long. The punters cheered on their 6-4 favourite, only to see Alexander Banquet, his stable companion, press on once more with Rince Ri. Florida Pearl's long run of success in the Hennessy was about to come to an end. Not that of trainer Willie Mullins, though. Rince Ri ran bravely and well, but Alexander Banquet soon had his measure. On the run to the line, it was Behrajan, who had looked to be struggling for fourth place at best on the home turn, who stayed on again. He was within a length and a half at the line, and might have got past in another 100 yards. He will have that, and more, in the Gold Cup at Cheltenham next month. Whether the placing of either horse will matter that much on March 14 may well depend on the going. It was desperate at Leopardstown yesterday, sticky and exhausting, and probably quite unlike the conditions at the Festival next month. Florida Pearl for one might be a different horse on better ground. \"Adrian said he just couldn't handle the ground,\" Mullins said. \"It's the first time really that he's run such a disappointing race, which in a long career isn't too bad.\" Alexander Banquet, inevitably, was the major mover in the betting once the layers had finished scribbling, but the fact that he is still 10-1 (from 20-1) with Coral suggests that this was hardly a conclusive Gold Cup trial. The same firm left Behrajan unchanged on 12-1 and pushed out Florida Pearl to 16-1 (from 12-1). Ladbrokes' odds reflected where Alexander Banquet's most realistic ambition may lie. He is their new 10-1 favourite for the Grand National in April. \"He's always had a race like this in him,\" Mullins said. \"He was second in this last year when I thought he was only three-parts ready, so I thought he had to have a good chance this year as he hasn't missed a gallop. There are very few horses in training that have won a Grade One bumper, a Grade One hurdle and a Grade One chase.\" Plenty of the punters who turned up at Leopardstown will have their travel and accommodation in the west country booked already. As regards paying for it, Like-A-Butterfly, who won the Deloitte &amp; Touche Novice Hurdle with a minimum of fuss, is the most obvious possibility to emerge from yesterday's card. Christy Roche's mare, who runs in the green and gold of JP McManus, could run in either the Supreme Novice Hur dle or the Royal &amp; SunAlliance Novice Hurdle next month, and JP would not be JP if he did not keep people guessing. Coral, the only British firm betting on the novice hurdles, reckon she will go for the Supreme, and quote her at 9-2 second favourite (from 6-1) behind Miros, the 3-1 favourite. The McManus colours were carried with rather less distinction by Youlneverwalkalone in the Dr PJ Moriarty Novice Chase, also a Grade One event, coming home only third behind Harbour Pilot and Truckers Tavern. Harbour Pilot now goes straight to the Royal &amp; SunAlliance Chase - he is the new 9-2 favourite from 14-1 with Coral - although Noel Meade, his trainer, is another who would like a wet Festival. Truckers Tavern could run in the Arkle Trophy, according to Ferdy Murphy, his trainer, but only if the ground is soft. Turtleback, who had been backed down to favouritism for the Triumph Hurdle, was taken out of the betting entirely by Ladbrokes after finishing a poor third in the Cashmans Juvenile Hurdle. Scolardy, trained by Willie Mullins, got the better of Newhall in a tight finish but the placings were reversed at a subsequent stewards' enquiry. Mullins is considering an appeal. Meanwhile Scolardy was cut to 16-1 from 25-1 for the Triumph by Coral."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
