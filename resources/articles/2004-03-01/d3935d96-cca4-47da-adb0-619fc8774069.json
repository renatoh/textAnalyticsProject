What was even more encouraging was that three of them were aged 21 or under. At a time when Scotland's national team seem to be slithering unchecked towards unprecedented ignominy, Celtic Park is emerging as a rare repository for hopes for the future. The youngest member of O'Neill's team, the 19-year-old goalkeeper, David Marshall, emerged as the most celebrated contributor to a 0-0 draw that took the Scottish champions-elect into the Uefa Cup quarter-finals. In defence of the 1-0 victory in the first leg of the tie two weeks earlier, the teenager was the most formidable barrier of all. In front of him, sharing the twin-pillars role with the towering Stanislav Varga, 20-year-old John Kennedy was the personification of composure, judgment and timing as he helped to disarm the Barcelona front line of Ronaldinho, Luis Garc\u00eda and Luis Enrique. The seemingly inexhaustible Stephen Pearson, 21, was, along with Stilian Petrov, the release conduit in midfield, willingly taking every opportunity to carry the ball into forward areas, affording those behind precious rest periods and spreading alarm among opposing defenders. In addition to these three, O'Neill has, in the course of this glittering season, given opportunities to Shaun Maloney, 21, Craig Beattie, 20, and Ross Wallace, 18, all of them home-bred. Even when allowances are made for the manager's natural inclination to talk up the prospects of any novice, it is clear that O'Neill's faith in the chances of all six making the grade is authentic. The most striking element of their emergence is its suddenness. At the start of the present campaign, only Maloney - not expected to regain fitness from knee-ligament damage until the autumn - was recognised as a first-team squad member. With Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton and John Hartson on the premises, the young striker's appearances were limited. Kennedy was striving to establish himself as a defender at a time when Varga, Bobo Balde, Johan Mjallby, Joos Valgaeren and Ulrik Laursen seemed to be insurmountable obstructions to his progress, but the diminishing powers of Mjallby and Valgaeren and Laursen's long absences because of injury have left their young challenger in the top three choices. Marshall had Robert Douglas, the regular Scotland goalkeeper, and Magnus Hedman, owner of more than 50 Sweden caps, obscuring his view of the first team. It would appear now that Marshall, in the four-and-a-half matches he has played since replacing Douglas when the latter was sent off at half-time in the first game against Barcelona - the result of a fracas in the players' tunnel - has seized the ascendancy among the goalkeepers. Hedman is on loan to Ancona in Italy and it is doubtful if Douglas would have dispossessed Marshall for today's Premierleague match against Rangers at Ibrox even if he had been recovered from a hip injury. Indeed, his unavailability is a blessing, at least postponing the moment when his demotion as a result of Marshall's excellence becomes official. It was not merely the series of exceptional saves against Barcelona that distinguished the young goalkeeper in the Catalan capital, but the nerve, decisiveness and alertness he demonstrated from the earliest stages of the match. 'Those early moments were a little worrying,' Marshall said. 'We had been talking in the dressing room of making sure we kept it tight in the first 15 or 20 minutes and, of course, it was anything but.' Having dived to his left to claw the ball cleanly from the feet of Gerard, Marshall thereafter gave the kind of flawless display that promises to make him immovable in the foreseeable future. Pearson was bought from Motherwell during the January transfer window. At \u00a3350,000 - with his contract due to expire in June, financially troubled Motherwell had no choice but to accept - his cost was negligible and his future value already looking immeasurable. If Wallace and Beattie have made only fleeting appearances in the first team, it does not dilute O'Neill's conviction that they also have the potential to become fine players. Nor does it reduce the shock of so many young Scots having made such progress in such a short time. For O'Neill, the six represent a persuasive advertisement for Celtic in the matter of recruiting other outstanding young players. From a national point of view, Celtic's flourishing crop offer justified optimism that, for the first time in at least two decades, Scotland may be on the verge of producing players of genuine quality - and, more importantly, in bunches.
