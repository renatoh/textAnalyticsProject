Of late, they have tended to become vehicles for starry groups of soloists, though they work best, as here, when they are treated as ensemble pieces, in which no one artist is allowed to upstage the others. The singers in this instance are Marlis Petersen, Stella Doufexis, Werner G\u00fcra and Konrad Jarnot, the pianists Christoph Berner and Camillo Radicke. There's a strong sense of emotional give-and-take between all six, and the two works are finely contrasted, with Liebeslieder-Walzer wittily observing the vagaries and rituals of desire, and Neue Liebeslieder very much about the sometimes regretful aftermaths of consummation. The two sets are separated by the reflective Drei Lieder, Op 64, exquisitely done, though their positioning fractures the mood. A classy, sophisticated disc, it works best if you reprogramme it so the Drei Lieder come at the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
