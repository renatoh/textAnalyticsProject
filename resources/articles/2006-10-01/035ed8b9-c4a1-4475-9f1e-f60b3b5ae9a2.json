I did the pushchair thing the first time and from what I've heard and read, slinging a baby makes lots of things so much easier so am really keen to \"baby-wear\" this time! Miranda Dunn, Derbyshire I can't recommend baby-wearing enough. I only wish I had discovered it earlier than I did. We had a Wilkinet, \u00a336.50, from birth, that was fab (www.wilkinet.co.uk, 0800 1383400) but it took me ages to work out I could also use it indoors and get on with things while carrying my baby, which is what they love, so they're more contented and cry less. My daughter was four months old before I discovered ring slings and even older before I discovered mei tais - traditional Asian carriers - and all the others out there. There are a few studies that show that babies who are slung (I use the word as a generic for all baby-wearing) cry far less. This is because babies are programmed to want to be close (no, it doesn't spoil them, quite the reverse) to a parent. But also we're all busy and have lives, so carrying a baby for any length of time is hard work. A good sling frees up your hands, distributes the weight over your back and shoulders and also holds the baby in a position that's good for their developing spines (avoid baby carriers that hold babies with their entire legs dangling and so put all the pressure on their lower back). A few things to remember: the closer your baby is slung to you, the lighter he will feel; you may get addicted and start a collection of slings; what works for one person may not work for another - I cannot stress this enough - so try a few out before you buy. A great way to do this is through www.slingmeet.co.uk, which is a website dedicated to meeting other sling-wearers in your area to get information and try out their slings (as in the ones they own; it's not a shop). The other thing to remember is that slings take a bit of getting used to - there is a learning curve. Don't let this put you off, because like all good things, it's worth it. Luckily, slings are mostly sold by parents who know their product and can advise in detail. It's not like going to a department store and being sold a pram by a 20-year-old who's never given birth, let alone been on a bus with a child and so will sell you a 15kg travel system. In your shoes I would look at a wrap initially - these are literally great lengths of material that you wrap round you in a variety of ways and knot to fasten (yes they are safe if you follow the instructions). The beauty of them is that they are really comfortable, you can keep them on but pop baby in and out. Stretchy wraps such as the Moby, from \u00a329.50 (from SaSa Slings, Little Possums or Baby-Bean) or Kari-Me, \u00a341 (Little Possums) are easier as they have \"give\"; not-so-stretchy ones such as the Ellaroo Wrap, from \u00a345 (Baby Bean, Little Possums, SaSa Slings) or Calin Bleu ones, from \u00a327.50 (www.calinbleu.com, 0845 862 0073) are more supportive when baby gets heavier. Ring slings are great because they're so easy - you literally shove baby in there and pull it to fit. The rings act as a tensioner, but not everyone gets on with them as they put all the weight on one shoulder and I found back carries difficult in them, but many mothers swear by their ring slings. Look at Zolowear (www.zolowear.com, 020-8810 6973), which makes great ring slings in cotton (around \u00a355) or silk - the latter aren't cheap at around \u00a3100 but they are extremely beautiful and the UK rep is a mine of information. One of the best-selling mei tais is the Kozy (www.kozycarriers.com), which you can only get from the makers in the US for about \u00a340. It is supremely comfortable, and is suitable from birth (but takes confidence with a newborn). A superb carrier for babies from six months (you can use from birth with the newborn insert, \u00a312) is the Ergo, from \u00a339.50 (www.freerangekids.co.uk, 01253 896290); this is very probably the carrier I hear most parents rave about more than any other. It's a soft-framed carrier, a bit like a rucksack, and I still carry my three-year-old daughter round in it for long stretches. I find it a godsend in the morning (at home) when she wants my attention but I have loads of things to do; she happily plays cars on the back of my head whilst I sort the day out. Two final things: baby's trousers can get pushed up in a sling, so invest in some fabulous baby-legs (like leg-warmers) to keep them warm, \u00a36.50 from SaSa Slings. And www.thebabywearer.com is a superb site for all sling information including those studies I talked about. www.baby-bean.co.uk, 01535 644800; www.littlepossums.co.uk, 01454 850446; www.sasaslings.co.uk, 01702 477234. \u00b7 Contact Personal Shopper, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER or email: annalisa.barbieri@mac.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
