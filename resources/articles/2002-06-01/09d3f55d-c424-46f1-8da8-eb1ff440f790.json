He is one of several leading athletes to be given this lifeline. Campbell, born and raised two miles from the new City of Manchester Stadium, had feared he would be left out after his withdrawal from the 200m at the trials last weekend due to illness. The inclusion of the Olympic 200m silver medallist and others is dependent on them justifying their places with good performances by the July 14 deadline. Campbell has not finished a 200m race since Sydney 21 months ago but is optimistic he will soon demonstrate what good form he is currently enjoying. \"I am happy to be given a place in the 200m and would like to thank the selectors for their confidence in me,\" said the 28-year-old, who is coached by the 1990 and 1994 Commonwealth 100m champion Linford Christie. It is a sensible decision in light of Dwain Chambers, Europe's top-ranked 200m runner, concentrating on the 100m. At his best Campbell is a match for anyone in the world and, if he can be fit in time, a victory would be a major boost. The European indoor 60m champion Jason Gardener is also a relieved man after being given a place in the 100m. He finished only fourth in the trials but his cause was helped when Chris Lambert, who finished third, said he preferred the 200m. Like Campbell, John Mayock, the Commonwealth 1500m silver medallist in Kuala Lumpur four years ago, will have to prove his fitness after missing the trials. His decision, though, has backfired as he wanted to run in the 1500m but has been picked for the 5,000m. The Olympic bronze medallist Kelly Holmes, chosen for the 800m and 1500m, the defending 110m hurdles champion Tony Jarrett and Donna Fraser, fourth in the Olympic 400m final, also have to prove their fitness. Less fortunate is the out-of-form 1998 triple-jump champion Larry Achike. The selectors can find no place for him alongside the Olympic champion and world record holder Jonathan Edwards. Tosin Oke and Phillips Idowu, also highly ranked in world terms, have the other places. Carl Myerscough, winner of the shot and discus at the trials, was not named for either event. The 24st \"Blackpool Tower\" needs special exemption from the English Commonwealth Games Council and they will decide on Thursday if Myerscough should be allowed to compete. The case of Matt Douglas, the 400m hurdler, who served a three-month suspension for a minor stimulant offence, is also on the agenda. ECGC rules state that anyone who has served a drugs suspension should not be allowed to represent England in the games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
