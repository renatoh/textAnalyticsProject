So there is this intrigue.\u201d Can you make a film about someone without seeing their face as they talk about their life and work? I\u2019m one of those desperate to see Sherman, to reconcile the person with the roles she creates for her art, but perhaps I\u2019m just prying. In the Arena documentary Cindy Sherman #untitled (BBC Four), we get her voice in a new interview, and Beavan has filleted previous filmed interviews, the last from 2009. Peel away the layers in her portraits and you can see the traces of Sherman\u2019s eyebrows and the wrinkles in her skin. \u201cYou can see the cracks in the armour,\u201d says her old photography teacher. She\u2019s in there somewhere, despite her best efforts to vanish. This film is a great look at one of the most important artists working today, told through the interviews with Sherman and through insightful offerings from those who have known and worked with her. I could have done without the inclusion of a group of Instagram influencers \u2013 used to make the point about how relevant Sherman\u2019s work is in our selfie-obsessed, digitally artificial world \u2013 and had more from Sherman on the big issues: love, death, ageing and parrot-keeping. Her parrot, Mister Frieda, is the only being allowed in the studio with Sherman while she works \u2013 it\u2019s a pity he only says \u201chello\u201d. I love Sherman\u2019s filing cabinets of props \u2013 fake eyeballs in one drawer, teeth in another, noses in another. People say she is really trying to do self-portraits or reveal a hidden side to her, but that\u2019s not right, says Sherman: \u201cIt\u2019s more that I\u2019m trying to lose myself, to really totally disappear.\u201d In footage from previous interviews, Sherman reveals more of her working practice \u2013 she has a mirror next to the camera and concentrates on \u201ctrying to transform that reflection that I see into this other person\u201d. She edits out the pictures where she recognises herself until \u201cfinally, I see the one that looks like somebody else\u201d. These somebody elses are a huge cast of characters, from clowns and Renaissance Madonnas and pig-nosed horrors to Hitchcockian heroines and pink-cheeked teenagers and ageing society dames. Even if we weren\u2019t allowed to see Sherman\u2019s process of transformation, it would have been great to have more on where these people came from. Like most children, Sherman loved dressing up. \u201cI think the whole reason I developed this into an art form,\u201d says Sherman in an older interview, \u201cwas that I would get dressed up whenever I was depressed or confused about things, I would go off into my room and turn into somebody else.\u201d An early series shows Sherman transforming herself, shot by shot, from an unremarkable young woman to \u201cthis total vamp\u201d. \u201cShe shows you,\u201d says Barbara Jo Revelle, her teacher from 44 years ago, \u201cthat it\u2019s a decision \u2026 how you create your own identity.\u201d So much of this is wrapped up in Sherman\u2019s experience of being a woman, from the anxiety she feels walking down a dark street to the memories of sleeping with curlers in her hair as a teenager \u201cand how uncomfortable women would make themselves in the name of being beautiful, but beauty at that time was really how men wanted women to look\u201d. Her Centerfolds series, created for the magazine Artforum (but never run, possibly because some of her women looked vulnerable and victimised), \u201cwere meant to resemble in format a centrefold, but in content I wanted a man opening up a magazine to look at it in expectation of something lascivious, and then feel like the violator they would be.\u201d Her stepdaughters (she says she was \u201clucky\u201d not to have her own children) remember, wonderfully, playing in the scenes Sherman created for her grotesque Fairytales and Disasters period in the 80s, complete with fake bums and boobs and homemade vomit. \u201cShe would let us put on all the makeup,\u201d remembers one. This work was a rally, remembers her old boyfriend, the artist Robert Longo, against the male artists who were being feted at the time when, he says, it was the women \u201cwho were making the most aggressive, toughest art possible\u201d. Sherman claims not to be political, at least in her personal life, but it\u2019s all there in her work. She made her 2008 portraits of ageing socialites so big \u201cbecause male artists do it all the time, even when they\u2019re not even well-known\u201d. She is grappling, points out the curator Eve Respini, \u201cwith what it means to get older as a woman in a really youth-obsessed culture\u201d. And now, she\u2019s on Instagram where she plays with filters \u2013 not to make herself look pretty, as everyone else does, but to transform herself not just into someone else, but something barely human. \u201cI see them as sketches,\u201d says Sherman, \u201cand maybe some of them will work their way into being real art pieces.\u201d A group of schoolgirls sit outside Sherman\u2019s current London show, scrolling through her Instagram pictures. One wants to know what she really looks like. \u201cOh wow, she looks quite normal,\u201d says another, finding an undisguised picture, and she sounds almost disappointed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
