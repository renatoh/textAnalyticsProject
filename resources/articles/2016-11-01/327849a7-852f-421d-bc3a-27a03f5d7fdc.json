About 190,000 new dwellings were added to the housing stock in the year to March 2016, which was an 11% increase on the previous year\u2019s new additions, not in overall housing stock. The article named the Shell Centre as a London office block that had been converted to flats; it is still offices (Rush of office conversions lifts housing stock by 11%, 16 November, page 27). \u2022 A review of a Bugzy Malone gig last week gave the venue as the \u201cRoyal Albert Hall, Manchester\u201d.
