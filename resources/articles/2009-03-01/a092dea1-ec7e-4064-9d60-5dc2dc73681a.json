Celtic won 2\u20130 at Hampden Park last weekend and are three points ahead heading into this weekend's league fixtures. \"The league continues,\" said Smith. \"Losing a cup final was extremely disappointing but if you allow it to have an effect on the rest of your season, then it becomes an even worse defeat. So we can't allow that to happen. We have to make up for it, and show determination to do that.\" Rangers welcome Hearts to Glasgow tomorrow; Celtic are at Dundee United on Sunday. Smith went on to counter accusations that his team had lacked invention six days ago. \"The one thing about Scotland is that we are always told our league isn't any good,\" he said. \"We keep being told that \u2013 and then we are expected to play a game you would really need to be in a far better league to play. \"It's a difficult environment in which to say you are going to play football when everyone tells you that you cannot afford to get the best players. The beautiful game requires beautiful players.\" Kirk Broadfoot is likely to miss today's game because of a calf problem. That has serious implications for the Scotland manager, George Burley. Smith regards his right-back as a doubt for the national team's match in Holland ono 28 March and Tottenham Hotspur's manager, Harry Redknapp, is adamant that Burley's first-choice, Alan Hutton, will not travel. \"I spoke to George Burley and he won't play Hutton against Holland, definitely not,\" said Redknapp of a player who has not played a competitive game since November, having fractured a foot. \"It is too quick after his injury.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
