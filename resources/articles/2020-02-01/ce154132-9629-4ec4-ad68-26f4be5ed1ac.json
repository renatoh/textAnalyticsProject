England are due to face Italy in Rome on 14 March on the final day of the Six Nations but there are already doubts over Italy\u2019s match against Ireland in Dublin a week earlier. The Irish health minister said on Monday that the fixture needs \u201cconsiderable consideration\u201d. The Italian rugby federation has also postponed all matches, from elite to grassroots level, this weekend and suspended all gatherings of its national teams in the affected regions. Postponed matches would mean the Six Nations is forced into at least one extra week, or fixtures could have to be played considerably later. That could wreak havoc, with France, England and Ireland still harbouring hopes of winning the title. In 2001 one match was played in September and two in October owing to the disruption caused by the spread of foot and mouth disease. Ireland\u2019s minister for health, Simon Harris, said: \u201cThe rugby game is something that needs considerable consideration. This situation is evolving. The weekend\u2019s activities have shown there is still an awful lot unknown about the coronavirus and about the path it might take. There will be some big decisions in the coming days. Most particularly, I\u2019m thinking of the Ireland-Italy game.\u201d Two Pro14 matches \u2013 Ospreys\u2019 match against Zebre in Parma and Ulster\u2019s trip to Treviso to play Benetton \u2013 have been called off. \u201cTo ensure the safety of our players and spectators Pro14 Rugby fully supports the preventative measures taken in Italy,\u201d read a statement. On Sunday, all sporting events in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto were postponed, including the women\u2019s Six Nations match between Italy and Scotland. Several towns in the areas are under lockdown. While England\u2019s men\u2019s side face Italy in Rome next month, both the women\u2019s and under-20 matches are scheduled for those affected regions. \u201cThe Six Nations is monitoring this situation very closely and is in regular contact with the [Italian federation] and all other unions and federations as well as the relevant local authorities and health organisations,\u201d read a statement from the tournament organisers. Mauro Vegni, the head of the race organisation for several top Italian cycling events including the Giro d\u2019Italia, which is scheduled to start on 9 May in Budapest, said he was concerned the virus could affect the Milan\u2011San Remo race next month. \u201cLike everyone, we are concerned by what\u2019s happening,\u201d he told Cycling News. \u201cAt the same time we hope that, with time, the situation will improve and that the number of cases will not increase. Milan-San Remo is the one that worries me the most,\u201d he added. At the moment there\u2019s no plan B for Milan\u2011San Remo. It would make no sense to cut three quarters of the race. We can only follow the lead from the government. We still have three weeks until Milan\u2011San Remo.\u201d South Korea\u2019s K-league has postponed the start of its football season, which had been due to kick off this weekend. \u201cThe K-league has decided to temporarily postpone the start of the 2020 K-league season until the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak eases,\u201d it said in a statement. Matches featuring Daegu FC, based in the city at that is the epicentre of the South Korea outbreak, and nearby Pohang Steelers, had already been postponed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
