While the performance and the 36-18 victory over New Zealand certainly ticked the boxes before this autumn\u2019s home Test series against the same opponents, this was more about showcasing the sport to a new audience. The early signs from the United States seem encouraging. A crowd of 19,320 may not seem that significant at first glance but, considering this was Denver\u2019s first exposure to rugby league and no attendance for any rugby game of either code in Colorado has been greater, it is hard to argue the game was anything other than a success. Rugby league\u2019s biggest challenge now was outlined by Wayne Bennett, the England coach. \u201cWe need people to stand up for our international game,\u201d he said. With this match facing such strong opposition from the Australian NRL over concerns about the travel and altitude, the sport has to build on the momentum it has created. \u201cIf we started State of Origin now, it would never get off the ground,\u201d Bennett said. Indeed, the crowd was far greater than the 12,349 who watched Queensland and New South Wales play in California in 1987 because, back then, Origin was perceived as a pointless exercise. Now, it is the pinnacle of the Australian game and, perhaps, a lesson in persistence for the sport at international level. With attitudes shifting towards the international game after the success of last year\u2019s World Cup, ensuring a return to the United States next year as soon as possible is the priority. The 2025 World Cup is being staged in the US and Canada, the ultimate moment for the game\u2019s venture into North America. What happens between now and then is crucial. \u201cI just hope we can come here again to start putting an imprint down on this place,\u201d Bennett continued. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a global product, we won\u2019t have a product within 20 years.\u201d This was not about how the game was perceived in the living rooms of Batley, Wigan and St Helens but how the American public took to the sport. They should have been impressed from the all-action 80-minute display of Sam Burgess to Ryan Hall\u2019s magnificent flying finish in the corner and the impressive debuts of Jake Connor and Tommy Makinson. England fans have plenty to be excited about at international level \u2013 but so too, it seems, does the game as a whole. With a World Cup seven years away, the potential of accepting teams from areas like New York \u2013 which already has a bid lodged with the RFL \u2013 into the British game is also important. But ultimately the sport\u2019s chance of long-term success lies with the international game. England and New Zealand gave it a significant shot in the arm on Saturday \u2013 but the sport must act decisively to ensure the momentum is not lost."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
