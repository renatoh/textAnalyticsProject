Until recently the England manager's business affairs were the subject of a tax investigation in Italy, which Digger can reveal was concluded last year with the payment of \u20ac5m (\u00a34.2m) to the Italian revenue service. Capello has confirmed to friends that the back tax was paid by an offshore company called Sport 3000, a firm he set up in April 2000 and in which he held 4,999 of Sport 3000's 5,000 shares. Its principal business was the import, export and sale of clothing, perfume and cosmetics. However, although its products were umbilically linked with the Fabio Capello brand name, he no longer has any personal connection to Sport 3000. In 2001, he sold his interest in it and he is neither a shareholder nor a director. According to documents held at the Luxembourg companies registry the purchaser of that interest, and the rights to market the Fabio Capello brand, was Maria Laura Guardamagna. She is a partner in Studi Guardamagna e Associati, the law firm where Capello's son and agent Pierfilippo is also a partner. From the outset Capello's other son, Edoardo, an economics graduate, was \u2013 and remains to this day \u2013 a Sport 3000 director. Capello states that in a previous court inquiry into his business affairs the judge made clear in his remarks that the England manager had done nothing improper. Strings attached So how much have Tom Hicks and George Gillett paid for Liverpool? No, not nothing at all. Far from it. Indeed, according to the club's accounts published last Friday, every Liverpool fan's favourite hate figures have injected \u00a3144m into the club, and more than \u00a386m of it between July 2008 and July 2009. Clearly this money does not come without strings. It is accruing 10% interest every year and, although this has not been paid to the club's Hicks-Gillett-controlled Cayman Islands parent, at the most recent count the rolled-up interest had reached \u00a38.1m. There are also questions about exactly what the provenance of the funds is \u2013 whether, for instance, it is Hicks's and Gillett's own cash raised from the sales of some of their US businesses or if it has been released from a contingency fund set up during their leveraged buyout. Fans will not be reassured that a spokesman for the pair did not answer these questions yesterday. They will also have concerns that despite the injection of these monies the club's financial position has worsened. But the money is there, and Kopites should be encouraged by the terms of the loans: \"Kop Football (Cayman) Limited cannot demand repayment if to do so would cause the company to become insolvent.\" Given that even the club's auditors pretty much admit the club already is, that money is there to stay. Wada on the outside The World Anti-Doping Agency will not have any direct role in drugs testing at the World Cup next month. The lack of Wada involvement strikes a blow for the players, who are angrily opposed to the intrusive \"whereabouts\" demands of its anti-doping code, which require that they tell drugs testers where they will be for one hour of every day. Wada claims its absence from formal procedures in South Africa is not a sign of ongoing tension with Fifa over the introduction of its information regime (even though the Football Association, which will not demand that its England players submit to a tough new drug\u2011testing regime until next season at the earliest, is by no means the sole national governing body thus far declining to set up a whereabouts database). Whether Wada's hoped-for whereabouts regime will ever be properly rolled out remains in doubt: the threat of a massive legal battle with the players remains. Wenger's windfall Arsenal's Highbury Square development, which even Alisher Usmanov's fellow major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, said last July was a threat to the club's financial future, is now contributing significantly to revenues. The redevelopment of the old stadium has paid off all debts, meaning the proceeds from all the remaining unsold units will flow directly to the club \u2013 and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's transfer kitty. In time, this is expected to provide him with a \u00a330m windfall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
