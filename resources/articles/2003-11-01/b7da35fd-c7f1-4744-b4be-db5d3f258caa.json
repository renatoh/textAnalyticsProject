We must end this blame-game between Whitehall and Town Hall. It should be local voters who decide whether local tax is too high or too low and they should do this on the basis of understanding the connect ion between local council spending decisions and local taxes.\" Sir Robin Wales, chairman of the Association of London Government: \"Had we been starting from a level playing field, this settlement would have been good news for London and our seven million residents - but this isn't the case. The reason London appears to do better this year is that its continued growth requires boroughs to provide local services to an increasing number of people who depend on them. But this settlement unfortunately won't allow us to continue to provide a range of local services valued by our communities\" Andrew Cozens, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services: \"The extra resources which have been provided must be seen in the context of our increased responsibilities, the substantial improvements in the overall quality of services which the government has rightly demanded, and certain key, high profile areas where especially high targets have been set.\" Kevin Morton, of the Local Government Information Unit: \"It's clear that ministers have struggled hard to close the \u00a3800m town hall funding gap that the Local Government Association identified, and to protect schools in particular, within a local government finance system that is over-complex, unsustainable and in need of radical reform. Some local services will still be squeezed, especially in the districts. There will be widespread above inflation council tax hikes and the threat of capping remains.\" John Bangs, head of education for the National Union of Teachers: \"The government is still not out of the woods. It has floors and ceilings in terms of money it guarantees local authorities and that is lower than last year. Where local authorities have higher costs such as those in the south-east, they are going to be pushing it and will have some difficulties. They have done better but they are not out of the woods.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
