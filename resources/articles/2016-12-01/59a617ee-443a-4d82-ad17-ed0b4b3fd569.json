But Turkish and Russian leaders moved rapidly to contain any damage to relations between the two countries, and analysts said that Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Vladimir Putin are likely to find common ground in the desire to assign blame to their perceived strategic adversaries. Both Ankara and the Kremlin announced that a meeting of foreign and defence ministers from Russia, Turkey and Iran to discuss the three allies\u2019 next steps in Syria is to go ahead as planned in Moscow. Erdo\u011fan called Putin to discuss the killing of Andrei Karlov and said afterwards they had agreed that \u201cour cooperation and solidarity fighting terrorism should be even stronger\u201d. Mustafa Akyol, a Turkish commentator, said Erdo\u011fan and Putin will each want to point the finger at their perceived antagonists. \u201cBoth sides believe in a western conspiracy to set them against each other,\u201d he said. Diplomatic analysts said that neither leader had an incentive to disrupt a loose accord they have reached over Syria, allowing each to pursue their war aims. Turkey has ensured that its incursion into northern Syria did nothing to weaken the siege on Aleppo by Russian and pro-Assad forces. Meanwhile, Moscow is widely believed to have given its assent to Turkish ambitions to take the northern Syrian town of al-Bab, to further its aim of blocking the consolidation of a Kurdish ministate, Rojava, on Turkey\u2019s southern flank. \u201cRussia and Turkey have every incentive to manage this crisis. The forced evacuation of Aleppo aids in Russia\u2019s war effort, while Turkey has won Russian acquiescence to its efforts in [al-Bab] \u2013 which is intended to blunt Kurdish expansionism,\u201d said Aaron Stein, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council thinktank. He added that the assassination is likely to make bilateral ties more asymmetrical than they already are. \u201cRussia has always had the upper hand. This just makes it stronger,\u201d he said. Turkey and Russia both alleged a broader conspiracy behind Monday\u2019s shooting. Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, referred to \u201cdark forces\u201d operating behind the assassin. Putin referred to Karlov\u2019s assassination as a \u201cprovocation\u201d aimed at derailing Russo-Turkish ties, using a common codeword for conspiracy by Moscow\u2019s foreign enemies. Pro-government commentators in both countries were quick to suggest there must be unseen western hands behind the killing, echoing Putin\u2019s and Erdo\u011fan\u2019s conspiratorial world views. A Russian senator, Frantz Klintsevich, claimed it was \u201chighly likely that representatives of foreign Nato secret service are behind\u201d Karlov\u2019s killing. Another senator, Alexei Pushkov, blamed \u201cpolitical and media hysteria\u201d sown by Russia\u2019s enemies, and tweeted that \u201cthe key question is who is behind the assassination and therefore an undeclared war on Russia\u201d. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s supporters started broadcasting a theory that the assassin was a supporter of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s political enemy Fethullah G\u00fclen, a Turkish cleric living in exile in the US. The Turkish president has blamed G\u00fclenists for a July coup attempt against him, using the claim as justification for arrests of ten of thousands of alleged G\u00fclen supporters in the government, military, judiciary and press. Turkish calls for his extradition are a major cause of friction in bilateral relations with the US. Sinan \u00dclgen, a former Turkish diplomat now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the killing in Ankara will not cause the same crisis in relations triggered by the Turkish shooting down of a Russian warplane along the Syrian border in November 2015. \u201cThis time around, there is no willingness on either side to escalate. On the contrary, first official statements tend to view this attack as an attempt to derail the ongoing rapprochement between Ankara and Moscow,\u201d \u00dclgen said. \u201cGoing forward, Moscow will nonetheless want a thorough investigation into the nature of the attack so as to identify the culprits. It remains to be seen whether this was a lone wolf attack or the doing of a more organised jihadist cell that has infiltrated Turkish law enforcement.\u201d Maxim Suchkov, an expert on the Middle East at the Russian International Affairs Council, agreed that there is no political incentive in either Moscow or Ankara to turn the killing into a wider crisis, and argued that fearful comparisons with the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo more than a century ago were misplaced. \u201cRussia and Turkey have recently had substantial contacts on the senior military and political level,\u201d Suchkov said. \u201cTroublesome parallels with the beginning of the first world war are in the air but if Erdo\u011fan manages to carry out timely and effective crisis diplomacy with Putin, there may be no serious consequences for the state of the bilateral relationship ... Too much is at stake for both Moscow and Ankara right now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
