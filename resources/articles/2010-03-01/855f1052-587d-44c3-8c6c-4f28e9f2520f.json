Shocking, isn't it, trying to develop the future wealth of the nation? What people in the arts repeatedly fail to grasp is that without science and technology our country will lag behind others, therefore it is a priority. Only by science and technology generating inventions and wealth can we afford the luxury of art, as important as it is in a modern society it does not in any way generate wealth in any real sense. Of course the theatre, for example, can generate money \u2013 it's a private enterprise \u2013 but it only generates money because society supports it. All societies throughout history, of course, support the arts, but support is the right word. And the comment that: \"The best indicator of what universities should teach is what students want to study\" is amusing although surely not serious. Perhaps we should all just teach computer games, or perhaps pop music. We enter a seriously competitive time for our country. Please support science and engineering, it is the economic lifeblood of our nation. Any references to the salaries of bankers is null and void in a capitalist society. But even those in the banks require wealth generation that only comes from inventions and innovation through science and engineering I have a love and understanding of the arts. It always saddens me how little the arts community reciprocates. Iain Morgan Professor of molecular oncology, University of Glasgow \u2022 Simon Jenkins' characteristically spirited defence of humanities and social sciences raises a tricky issue and a challenge. The tricky issue is that while there are worries about government deciding which subjects students should or should not study at university, the debate about this can too easily descend into something that Jenkins rightly sought to avoid \u2013 a sterile battle between science subjects and the rest. The damaging myth of two rival cultures needs to be challenged at every turn, especially if it prompts asymmetrical resource allocation. As Melvyn Bragg has said: \"In this country there is a very large minority who take it for granted that the multiverse, the dissolution of the monasteries, the history of the brain, zero, Avicenna and Joseph Conrad belong to the same spectrum.\" It is talent, innovation and creativity, in all its forms and in all rigorous disciplines, that we need to nurture in our young people. Adam Roberts President, British Academy \u2022 Simon Jenkins' commentary is timely, as the Higher Education Funding Council has published its \"consultation outcomes\" for the Research Excellence Framework outcomes, which will give birth to a maze of panels and assessment groups to gauge the impact of \"research outputs\" from British universities and colleges. The word impact in its \"wider impact\" manifestation is perhaps only \"widely\" understood by Peter Mandelson, but the blood is already on the carpet in many universities, including King's College London, whose principal, Professor Rick Trainor, was one of the signatories to the Observer letter from which Simon Jenkins quotes on the imperative need to understand the world and its people through the study of \"their language, identities, histories, faiths and cultures\". Fine words indeed, but of little consolation to the 235 people who may lose their jobs at King's at the end of this academic year, and not just in the humanities and social sciences: King's boasts the oldest department of engineering in the United Kingdom; its department of past and present distinction is to close this year as part of a \"redeployment exercise\". And Oxford's new vice-chancellor, Professor Andrew Hamilton, may recall that the Exeter University department of chemistry on which he cut his undergraduate teeth was closed a few years ago, victim to the Review Assessment Exercise, father and mother of the REF.
