Neville was speaking after the Manchester derby, which saw United defeat City 2-1. The result, however, was overshadowed by an incident during the second half of the game that appeared to show a City fan making a monkey gesture towards a United player. Speaking on television afterwards, Neville linked the incident with the political leaders debate on the BBC on Friday evening. \u201cYou are watching the prime minister\u2019s debate where he is talking about migration to this country and people having to have certain levels. It fuels it all the time. It has got worse over the last few years in this country and not just in football,\u201d said Neville, a former Manchester United and England international. He added: \u201c[This fan] thinks he can come to a game and racially abuse someone playing football. It is disgusting. It is terrible and something has to be done. It is not just about banning him from football. Everyone has a responsibility.\u201d He suggested English football has a greater responsibility after Gareth Southgate\u2019s England team players were racially abused in Bulgaria earlier this year. \u201cWe always judge other countries on how they deal with racism but we are poor with dealing with it ourselves,\u201d he said. Manchester City said on Sunday night they were \u201caware of a video circulating on social media which appears to show a supporter making racial gestures\u201d during the match. The club also said they are \u201cworking with Greater Manchester Police in order to help them identify any individuals concerned\u201d. Manchester City said they operate a \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d regarding discrimination of any kind, adding that anyone found guilty of racial abuse will be banned for life. They said they were also investigating an incident where objects were being thrown onto the pitch aimed at players. After the game, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r spoke out strongly about the incident. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the video, heard from the players. We keep talking about it every bloody week. But he\u2019s been caught on camera. He should, in my opinion, never be allowed into a football ground again. It is unacceptable.\u201d Manchester United made a formal complaint to the referee and their opponents after the game, it was revealed. \u201cI am sure that City and the authorities will deal with it. We keep talking about it every week and it doesn\u2019t stop unless it\u2019ll have consequences.\u201d Rival City manager Pep Guardiola said afterwards: \u201cI support the statement the club has done. I am pretty sure the club and policemen are going to make the right decision for it not to happen again. Of course, it is a battle to fight every day, so unfortunately it happens in many places and hopefully it cannot happen again.\u201d Jesse Lingard, one of the United players at whom racist abuse was allegedly directed, said on social media last night: \u201cNot even this idiot can ruin tonight\u2019s feeling, shameful behaviour. It may be a derby but there is never ever a reason to be racist!\u201d Kick It Out, the campaign to rid football of racism, said last night it had been \u201cinundated with reports of alleged racist abuse from a number of individuals at the Manchester Derby. We will be contacting both clubs to offer our support and hope swift action is taken to identify the offenders.\u201d The Professional Footballers\u2019 Association condemned the alleged abuse: \u201cWe are disappointed by what appears to be racist abuse from fans at the Manchester derby. We welcome this prompt response from Manchester City. Racist abuse is a criminal offence and must be dealt with accordingly.\u201d League Two club Forest Green Rovers reported on Saturday night they were investigating a further incident of alleged racist abuse by a supporter of a player during their game with Scunthorpe United."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
