One day she is sacking the West Ham United manager, Gianfranco Zola, the next she is on the BBC's Junior Apprentice with Alan Sugar, assessing \"Britain's brightest and youngest business minds\". Gawd help us. According to Wikipedia \u2013 and I accept that is not the most promising start to a sentence \u2013 Brady impressed her boss, David Sullivan, because she was \"a sacker\". True to her reputation, she had the much loved but unrealistically remunerated Italian out of the Upton Park door in 10 minutes, with m'learned friends standing by, licking their lips over the afters. \"Sackers\" like Brady \u2013 who in truth does not do a lot on Junior Apprentice but presumably got the gig for her experience of working with self-made men of vaguely scrotal appearance \u2013 are clearly going to be in increasingly high demand in these straitened times. This may be why Jordan De Courcy, one of the contestants, chose to launch his campaign in the following charming manner: \"I'm ruthless. If somebody is there that I don't need in my company, they're gone. It's as simple as that.\" Jordan is 16. I realise these programmes are heavily \u2013 and, yes, ruthlessly \u2013 edited so that some participants appear even more hideously and hilariously self\u2011aggrandising than they already are, but really, when 16- and 17\u2011year\u2011olds are going around saying things like \"I don't want to be like my mum\" \u2013 hello, mum \u2013 \"I'm going to make sure I achieve my goals, no matter what life throws at me\", and \"I'm not a business boy, I'm a business man\", they only have themselves to blame. At that age, kids are not supposed to be boasting about their business expertise. They are supposed to be hanging around outside chip shops, the boys telling wildly exaggerated stories about their sexual exploits and begging the one kid who has a motorbike to let them have a go. And the girls \u2026 well, frankly I have no idea. But just mooching about pointlessly did seem to be a necessary stage we all went through. (\"But weren't those the Swinging Sixties?\" my kids always say, and I have to explain that the Swinging Sixties did not turn up in Manchester till about 1973. Antonioni was not shooting movies in Cheetham Hill.) Maybe if Zola had seen Brady with some of these ruthless go-getters on Junior Apprentice, he might not have expected Sullivan and David Gold, West Ham's co-owners, to have a conversation with him, which is what he anticipated in his last press conference of the season. The property and porn barons did not even turn up for the meeting, leaving their \"sacker\" to do the deed. That, I'm afraid, is how it works. I once did an interview with a \"consultant\" whose job was to \"sort out\" reportedly inefficient Health Service Trusts. She told me the element of surprise was key in the sacking scenario. Wrong\u2011foot the sackee by calling him or her in for a \"quick meeting\" midway through a Monday morning, when they least expect it, and hey presto. It is typically sweet of Zola to have expected otherwise. If he is looking for solace \u2013 along with compensation, obviously \u2013 he might be comforted to learn that when his sacker was on Desert Island Discs she chose Last Christmas by Wham! and Abba's Dancing Queen among the discs she wished to spend the rest of her life with. So if she ever gets marooned, that will teach her. He may also take comfort from the triumph of his old team in an FA Cup final that was far more entertaining than most of us expected. Having endured Chelsea's prolonged, orgasmic celebrations at Stamford Bridge after their Premier League success the previous Sunday, one's appetite for more Chelsea triumphalism was limited. The Cup final felt more like a post\u2011coital cigarette than the climax to the season. In the event it was a very watchable game of football and ITV's coverage was pitched about right. It is pointless to pretend the Cup final means anything like it used to, so the pre-match malarkey was kept fairly tight, the highlight being a short film following Avram Grant back to Israel and to his grandparents' graves in Russia. The piece featured the estimable Mrs Tzofit Grant's appearance on Israeli TV, drinking her own urine. The presenter, Matt Smith, offered the opinion that Mr and Mrs Grant would be popular figures at any Premier League club. \"As long as they don't put her in charge of the half\u2011time drinks,\" said Andy Townsend, which might have been Joke of the Week were it not for the Junior Apprentice show, during which you would need to have a heart of stone not to be in constant paroxysms of mirth. The contestants I particularly like are Rhys Rosser and Tim Ankers, not just for the possibilities they provide in terms of rhyming slang. I like Rhys because he looks like Alfred E Newman from Mad Magazine and was savvy enough to note that Instinct, the name chosen for the boys' team, sounded like a deodorant, and Tim because he said he could not cut up cheese on his market stall because it was too windy. That is the kind of attitude teenagers should have. I should not laugh too much, though. They will probably be running West Ham in a couple of years' time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
