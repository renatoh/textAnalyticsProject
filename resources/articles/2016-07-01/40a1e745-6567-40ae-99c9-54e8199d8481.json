On Monday, as part of a lengthy Twitter tirade over the Dolphins\u2019 perceived failings, Miko Grimes tweeted: Ross and Tannenbaum are Jewish. The Glazer family, who own her husband Brent\u2019s current team, the Buccaneers, are also Jewish. Tannenbaum, who was hired by Miami in 2015, left the New York Jets after signing Mark Sanchez to a disastrous five-year, $58.25m deal. Miko Grimes has long been critical of the Dolphins and their personnel. Last year, she openly criticized Ryan Tannehill, who threw 24 touchdowns and 12 interceptions on the season. Brent Grimes was cut by Miami in March after nine years with the team, and days later signed a $16.5m deal with the Bucs. By Monday afternoon, Grimes was yet to delete the tweet, and she was unrepentant afterwards: She also told ESPN: \u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Jew buddies\u2019, I was speaking about how a lot of communities (Jewish, Christian, gay, sometimes fraternities and sororities) will hire their \u2018own people\u2019 for jobs before others. That\u2019s a fact! Why people find facts offensive is strange to me. And now I\u2019m a racist? Lmao! How?\u201d The Dolphins told ProFootballTalk that the team have no comment. The Buccaneers also said they have no comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
