Dragon Flyer, on whom Steve Drowne put up 1lb overweight, struck the front approaching the final furlong and kept going well to hold off Funfair Wane by half a length. McCourt said: \"That's perfect. As a jockey I won on both my first and last rides and also my first runner as a trainer, Lance Armstrong, was a winner - and I rode him too.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
