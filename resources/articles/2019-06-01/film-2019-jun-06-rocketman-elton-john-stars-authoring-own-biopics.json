A haggard-looking John plops in his chair and rattles off his laundry list of flaws: he\u2019s a profligate boozer and overly fond of both cannabis and cocaine, he\u2019ll shag anything with a pulse and a Y chromosome, he has wrestled with a touch of bulimia, some anger management issues here and there, etc. The film frontloads this scene as a purposeful statement of intent, that this will be the warts-and-all biopic from which Hollywood studios tend to shy away. Take him or leave him, here\u2019s the real Elton John, or so director Dexter Fletcher would have us believe. The movie that follows this bold overture has no intention of following through on this declaration of imperfection, at least not with any sincerity. The script pays lip service to these vices and failings, allowing a stylish quick cut of the occasional railed line without even approaching the cyclone of dysfunction and despondency the public already knows John spiraled into being. His tantrums, mild as they are, usually stem from some provocation placing them not so far past reasonable. It\u2019s possible that Fletcher\u2019s simply a weak film artist, and God knows his previous work completing Bohemian Rhapsody supports the theory. But that earlier Freddie Mercury portrait also suggests a sort of corollary \u2013 that bringing a subject on to develop their own biopic can result only in dilution and creative compromise. It\u2019s a regrettably common occurrence, for a noted figure to shepherd their own movie treatment through production. This generally streamlines and accelerates the tedious process of development, with a marquee name attracting financiers and quelling potential squabbles over life rights. In the instance of something like Rocketman, the real Elton\u2019s cooperation was practically a must, as the film dies without access to his deep catalogue of pop-rock hits. But allowing a person some measure of authority over their own depiction on film sets a director on a slippery slope that ends with pleasing the talent instead of challenging the audience. At the time of Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019s release, detractors attributed many of the Queen chronicle\u2019s shortcomings \u2013 from twitchy editing schemes to the mismatched characterization of Freddie as a self-destructive timebomb in contrast with the decent and responsible other members of the band \u2013 to the participation of \u201cconsultants\u201d Brian May and Roger Taylor. The vast majority of faces from pop cultural history have treated a movie as a chance to shape and secure their legacy, the exact antithesis of the form, which exists to pick apart the public\u2019s conception of a well-known figure and then defy it. Even in the examples concerning less-famous personalities, their coming on board proves bane as much as boon. Movies such as the recent Fighting With My Family (the life and times of stereotype-flouting English wrestler Paige) or Walk Ride Rodeo (the true account of paraplegic rodeo racer Amberley Snyder\u2019s journey back to the saddle) could not exist without the thumbs-up from the genuine article to use their likeness and story. This also has a way of defanging movies, however, with the main character\u2019s only stroke of complexity relegated to something simple and inoffensive. In both aforementioned films, the main character shows a bit of spiky personality before taming those impulses to grow into the disciplined, inspirational force their real-life counterpart would love to be. This phenomenon may have hit its nadir with the recent On the Basis of Sex, a Ruth Bader Ginsburg picture with the actual Notorious RBG\u2019s seal of approval. Ginsburg herself had a hand in the film \u2013 we know this because it ends with actor Felicity Jones scaling the steps of the supreme court like Rocky Balboa until she transforms into the justice we all recognize \u2013 and seldom has there been a more naked act of self-hagiography. The script takes no interest in showing us any side of this woman other than the public-facing one. She\u2019s intelligent, she\u2019s driven, she\u2019s not taking any guff from her male colleagues and she\u2019s out to change America \u2013 right in line with the history books. The most revealing bits concern the rather healthy sex life between Ginsburg and her unflaggingly, almost comically supportive husband, Martin (Armie Hammer). Even then, she\u2019s still being cast in a generous light. Ginsburg\u2019s only sin? Fighting for the rights of her fellow women too damn hard. Of course this inclusionary method makes for thin, flaccid, facile entertainment, but more meretriciously, it undermines the purpose of biographical cinema. Consider The Social Network, adapted from a nonfiction book that already waded through thickets of legal red tape to write about the Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg against his will. The film faced many of the same squabbles about accuracy and fairness and a lack of generosity towards the big names that made this story worth telling. While that film\u2019s screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, took some liberties with the facts and drew flak for it, he also gave us one of the decade\u2019s finest exemplars of the biopic. The film ends a lot closer to Citizen Kane than the feelgood picture book suggested by On the Basis of Sex, with our insights into an icon muddled rather than affirmed. Efforts conceived under this philosophy make the utterly true assertion that close dissection of anyone would expose real contradiction, ugliness and frailty. Sanitize these elements as Hollywood may, it\u2019s the nasty, unflattering things that make us human. Famous types may commission the building of a trophy in their image if they so please. They should just know that that\u2019s exactly how it makes them look: gold, plastic, lifeless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
