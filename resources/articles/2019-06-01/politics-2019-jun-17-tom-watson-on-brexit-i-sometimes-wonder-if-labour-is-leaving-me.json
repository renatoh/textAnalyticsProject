It\u2019s leaving me\u2019", "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has said he believes his party would be \u201cleaving me\u201d if it cannot fully endorse a second referendum, hours after giving a speech in which he said it should be the party of remain. Watson told the BBC that Labour \u201ccertainly might lose some votes\u201d for backing a referendum, but would pay \u201ca very high electoral price\u201d for not taking a clear position on Brexit. Asked if he might be prepared to leave the party without a clear change of direction, he said, \u201cI\u2019m never going to leave the Labour party,\u201d but then added: \u201cSometimes I wonder whether the Labour party is leaving me.\u201d Watson said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d Labour\u2019s position would change at the party\u2019s annual conference in September, but said he feared \u201cby then it will be too late\u201d. The deputy leader\u2019s interview followed a speech he gave at a pro-EU thinktank arguing that Labour needed to make a better case for continued EU membership \u2013 even at this late hour. Watson\u2019s intervention was immediately criticised by the party chair Ian Lavery, a vociferous opponent of a second referendum. \u201cBrexit has turned this country into a toxic nation. However, ignoring the 17.4 million leave voters isn\u2019t politically smart nor indeed particularly democratic. Is it?\u201d Lavery tweeted after Watson\u2019s speech. Watson said that no one should question his motivation in pushing for the change. \u201cYou may disagree with me fundamentally, and I respect that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think for the Labour party, having knocked on doors up and down the country in the local and European elections, having spoken to many thousands of Labour voters, many of whom are lifelong Labour party members who told me they were voting for the parties at the election because of the lack of clarity on our position.\u201d In his speech at the Centre for European Reform, Watson also took a veiled swipe at some Labour MPs and union officials, including Unite\u2019s general secretary, Len McCluskey, who have cautioned against a referendum, suggesting they had not made the case for how the EU had helped their towns and workers. \u201cFor those on the left to fail to acknowledge that is to rewrite history,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is no \u2018boss\u2019s club\u2019, it is both an engine of progress and a backstop against regressive and repressive governments.\u201d He said his party needed to become the home for remainers after European election results that had seen the party squeezed by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. \u201cEuropean is who we are and who we have always been,\u201d he said. \u201cOur members are remain. Our values are remain. Our hearts are remain. We need our Labour party to be true to who we are and be loud and proud in support of Europe.\u201d Watson said that a new public vote was the only option now that parliament and the government had failed to break the impasse. \u201cWe put the question back to the people because parliament and government \u2013 as we reach the three-year mark \u2013 have proved utterly incapable of implementing Brexit, and shows no more sign of doing so now than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cThe notion that it\u2019s in some way undemocratic to let the people put an end to this crisis because, after three years, parliament and government cannot, is absurd. And if you want Brexit, and you believe there is still a majority for it in the UK, then a public vote will break the deadlock and deliver the Brexit you want.\u201d Watson suggested the party needed to step up its campaigning for a public vote. \u201cNow is the time to speak out more loudly than ever, before any further irreparable damage is done,\u201d he said. At a fractious meeting of Labour MPs last Monday, Jeremy Corbyn was urged to move faster to change the party\u2019s policy. However, a special meeting of Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet due to take place to discuss Brexit policy on Monday was cancelled because \u201ca number of colleagues [were] unable to attend\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
