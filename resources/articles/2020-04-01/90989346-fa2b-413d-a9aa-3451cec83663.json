About 15 years ago, the Melbourne couple were at a social event and James, who has struggled with depression throughout his life, had hit a bad spot. He refers to Rebecca as his \u201crock\u201d, but on this occasion it became too much for her. She turned to him and said: \u201cI can\u2019t be your support person right now. There\u2019s a lot of lovely people here who love you. Please go and get support from one of them because I can\u2019t be that person right now.\u201d That hurt, says James now. \u201cIt felt like being slapped. It was horrible. And it was necessary and absolutely the right decision \u2026 I\u2019m glad she did it.\u201d The candour with which James and Rebecca discuss their 26-year relationship is refreshing. They\u2019ve done plenty of work to get there. They don\u2019t shy from talking about their dynamic: while Rebecca gives James stability, he helps her work through her emotions before she makes any big decisions. \u201cThat\u2019s all really positive,\u201d says James, \u201cbut [in the first 10 years] we did get very co-dependent, and undoing that was one of the hardest things we\u2019ve ever done as a couple.\u201d Before the moment at the party, James says: \u201cI think I started to think of myself as half of a couple. I forgot that I\u2019m an individual as well, and I think it took Rebecca really putting her foot down to remind me of that.\u201d They met online in 1993, three years before the word \u201cinternet\u201d came into common usage. He was in Wagga Wagga, she was in Bendigo, and they were both on the only Australian MUD (multi-user dimensions) playing a text-based version of World of Warcraft. \u201cPeople tended to use [games] very much like World of Warcraft these days \u2026 as much for socialising as they did for actually playing a game,\u201d says James. As a woman online, Rebecca was a rarity and she got plenty of attention. James helped her navigate it. They struck up a connection, talking via early text chat programs, on the phone and even writing letters. But Rebecca had a boyfriend, and James was determined to remain honourable, so they remained just good friends. That is until they met in person. After a few months of chatting, James went to Bendigo to visit Rebecca. \u201cThe first three thoughts that went through my head were: \u2018Oh my goodness, she has beautiful eyes. Oh my goodness, she\u2019s got a beautiful smile. Oh my goodness, she\u2019s so short,\u2019 \u201d he says. But finally meeting in person was strange, says James: \u201c[I was trying to work out] how this actual physical person in the real world relates to this digital person that I\u2019ve known. Where are the common threads? Where are the differences? I\u2019m just trying to find the person that I know in this physical presence.\u201d They shared a kiss that weekend but went back to their lives, keeping in touch online and on late night phone calls. Then, after a couple of visits back and forth, James asked Rebecca to marry him. \u201cWe\u2019d been together in person connecting in physical space for 10 total days. I had no plan. There was no sort of agenda ... I just knew. There was a part of me that just went, this is the person I really do want to spend the rest of my life with. And so I just asked.\u201d Rebecca hesitated because of the speed of it all, but agreed. In 1994 they both moved to Melbourne, and after a few months they moved in together. Later that year they set a date for their wedding and were married in March 1996. Although they are quite different in many ways \u2013 \u201cRebecca is a very textbook introvert, and [James is] a very textbook extrovert\u201d \u2013 the couple share many interests and have similar politics. \u201cThere was always a desire to do the right thing and to try to achieve results that were as positive as was possible for everybody,\u201d says James. \u201cAnd I think that was something that we really shared. We cared about each other, but we cared about people in general, and we cared about the world.\u201d One of their strengths as a couple is that they are honest with each other in \u201ca constructive and compassionate way\u201d. Says James: \u201cA lot of the time when you meet people and they say that they practise radical honesty, what they mean is they\u2019re arseholes. They just mean that they don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s feelings and they just want to speak their mind and they don\u2019t care what the consequences are. I think one of the things that really drew us together is that we cared about the consequences of our own actions, and we cared about how we impacted on other people, even though we did it in very different ways.\u201d That honesty has helped them negotiate another part of their relationship: both are bisexual and non-monogamous. They are prominent members of Bisexual Alliance Victoria, and have had other partners at different times in their relationship. Having other people around has meant there has been more support when things have been difficult. For instance, when Rebecca was diagnosed with breast cancer it helped to have other people to share the load: \u201cHaving all that support meant that it was easier for me and easier for James, because James knew that he wasn\u2019t on his own having to deal with this. I don\u2019t think that with my cancer diagnosis, James would have coped if there weren\u2019t other people around giving him the support he needed.\u201d There is rarely any serious conflict between them because they try to talk about things before they become a real issue. \u201cWhen we do disagree, we try to find a solution,\u201d says James. \u201cIt\u2019s never: \u201cHow can I win this?\u2019 It\u2019s always: \u2018How can the two of us together make this work?\u2019 And sometimes the compromise will be that somebody will miss out or both of us will get something we\u2019re not 100% happy with.\u201d Their affection for each other is obvious \u2013 James frequently slings his arm around Rebecca and she reaches out to touch him reflexively. This is deliberate, they say. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to me that people I\u2019m in a relationship with actually like me touching them,\u201d says Rebecca. \u201cI don\u2019t really see the point of being in relationships with people who don\u2019t like me to touch them \u2026 I am happy stroking and massaging and leaning into people.\u201d Particularly in the early days of their relationship, sex became a way of recharging their batteries, says James. \u201cTouch in general, even not actual sex ... It\u2019s like that grounding \u2026 I\u2019m here, you\u2019re there, we\u2019re touching each other and we\u2019re together, and fuck the rest of them, basically.\u201d Their other secret, says Rebecca, is that they enjoy being silly. \u201cDoing that every couple of days, just laugh until you cry, because you walk out with all those endorphins from laughing and happiness. And you can\u2019t think ill of your partner if you\u2019ve just spent together 20 minutes laughing with them.\u201d The couple works hard on their relationship, and where other couples grow apart, they have been very determined to grow together over their 26 years. \u201cWe spend time together and we check in about stuff. We have deep and meaningful conversations about all sorts of topics, just because they\u2019re fun,\u201d says Rebecca. \u201cI like talking to James. He\u2019s fun to talk to. And we talk a lot about stuff that\u2019s important to ourselves. It\u2019s not every single day, and it\u2019s not every single conversation that\u2019s deep and meaningful and serious, but there\u2019s a lot of checking in and a lot of making sure that we\u2019re still good.\u201d And they are always happy to see each other. When they were both working not far from each other they would have lunch together regularly. James remembers his colleagues asking him about it. \u201cThey were like: \u2018You live with her and see her every night. Why do you want to go have lunch with her?\u2019 \u201d And I just looked at them with this puzzled expression on my face, [and said]: \u201cBecause I like her. I enjoy her company. Why else would I have married her if I didn\u2019t like her and enjoy her company?\u201d We want to hear your stories about staying together.
