Pirlo, running into his prime at 26, is only just gaining the recognition his years of hard work deserve. Certainly the Scotland manager Walter Smith knows all about him; he scored twice for Italy with identically flighted free-kicks in a World Cup qualifier against the Scots at San Siro two months ago. Pirlo has been described as the Milan linchpin, a deep-lying playmaker who can dictate the game with his control, vision and passing. He is also a free-kick specialist par excellence, but his learning curve has been gradual. Of modest stature (1.77m and 68kg - 5ft 10in and 10st 10lb), he was a product of Brescia's youth system and starred for Italy's Under-21 side but his career stalled after a move to Internazionale. The nerazzurri were unable to make best use of his talents and loaned him out to Reggina and Brescia before a surprise switch to Milan in 2001. Now he is the sort of player every coach would love to have. Having converted from an attacking midfielder at Inter, Pirlo plays just in front of the back four for Milan, but not in the style of a Roy Keane or Patrick Vieira. He leaves the growling aggression to Gennaro Gattuso and Clarence Seedorf on either side of him, preferring to use using his vision and ability to read the game to spot the opposition's gaps and spring the kind of devastating counter-attacks that did for Manchester United across two legs. If anyone is a danger to Liverpool it is Pirlo. \"He is the best in the world in his role,\" said the Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti. \"He is a complete player; he can do everything on the pitch.\" His team-mates are equally appreciative. \"When I see what Andrea can do with the ball I have to ask myself whether I am a footballer,\" Gattuso said. Indeed, when Pirlo does not play, neither do Milan. This season they dropped crucial points in the race for the Scudetto against minor teams such as Livorno, Bologna and Siena when he was injured, Juventus eventually taking the title. \"There isn't a substitute for Pirlo at Milan,\" said Milan's assistant coach Mauro Tas sotti, and the vice-president Adriano Galliani confirmed: \"When he doesn't play we have to change our system because no one else can play like Pirlo; he is a unique and irreplaceable player.\" If Liverpool manage to take Pirlo out of tonight's game in Istanbul, Rafael Ben\u00edtez's side will surely increase their chances of lifting the trophy. They could do worse than take a leaf out of Marcello Lippi's book. When Milan played Juventus in 2003 the Juve coach ordered Pavel Nedved to close Pirlo down whenever he received the ball. Juventus won 2-1 and Pirlo had one of his worst nights in football. \"Pirlo is the key to Milan's game,\" said Lippi, now the Italy coach. \"Whenever we were facing Milan we prepared the game keeping in mind Pirlo's characteristics. He is pivotal for Milan with his technical qualities and intelligence.\" Lippi still regrets that because of suspension he could not count on Nedved when the two sides met again a few months later in the Champions League final won by Milan on penalties at Old Trafford.
