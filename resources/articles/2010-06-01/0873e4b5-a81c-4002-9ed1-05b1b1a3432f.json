A stuttering qualification campaign, injuries to key players, and doubts over the coach have dampened hopes. But if the defensive partnership of Ricardo Carvalho and Bruno Alves stay fit, if Pepe is fully recovered, and if Carlos Queiroz can coax the same form out of Cristiano Ronaldo as when the two were at Manchester United, who knows? That's probably too many ifs. I'd say it'll be a last-16 finish. Men to watch: Given that Ronaldo will almost certainly be double or triple-marked, it'll open up space for other flair players like Nani and Sim\u00e3o. Another player who could explode is Danny. After a year out injured, he has been in outstanding form for Zenit St Petersburg. And Alves is looking to impress scouts. Weakest link: Midfield. Two of Raul Meireles, Tiago, Pedro Mendes and Deco are likely to be on the pitch at all times and it is difficult to see any of these getting into any other top international side. The coach: Queiroz is an astute tactician and surprisingly audacious. I rate him, but I'm in the minority. Best chant: Brace yourself for the blindingly original: \"POR-TOOO-GAL-POR-TOOO-GAL ...\" Least-liked opponents: France, for beating Portugal in the semis at Euro 84, Euro 2000 and World Cup 2006. TIPS Winner: Argentina. Good enough to survive Diego. Golden boot: Gonzalo Higua\u00edn (Argentina). England: There are too many issues: the second striker, the Lampard/Gerrard partnership, centre-backs' injuries, the goalkeeper, wingers. It'll take everything to click into place at once. Tricky.
