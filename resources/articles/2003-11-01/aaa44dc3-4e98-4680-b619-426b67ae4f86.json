(HP) as an inexpensive method of storing digital information. Researchers at the Princeton, New Jersey school and Palo Alto, California-based company, were able to develop a write-once memory cell that can hold gigabytes of information and be produced very inexpensively from a commonly used plastic substance and a small amount of silicon, they said. \"The plastic polymer is known as PEDOT, a shortened version of the chemical name for the substance. PEDOT conducts electricity at low voltages, but is a semiconductor at higher voltages, said Craig Perlov, a scientist with HP Labs, in an interview with the IDG News Service.\" The story continues here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
