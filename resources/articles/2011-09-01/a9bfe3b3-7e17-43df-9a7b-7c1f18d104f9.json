That was the conclusion of a panel of newspaper editors, politicians, regulators and lawyers at a meeting chaired by Sir Harold Evans in which the outgoing chair of the Press Complaints Commission faced questions about her organisation's effectiveness. Lionel Barber, the editor of the Financial Times, said that he wanted to plead for \"one last drink in the last chance saloon\" arguing that newspapers, under increasing financial pressure, did not have the resources to pay for a heavy regulatory burden, at the event organised by Thomson Reuters. However, he added that the Press Complaints Commission needed to be revamped, and that \"the new body needs to have investigatory powers\" \u2013 amid wide spread criticism of the body that is currently chaired by Baroness Buscombe. Human rights lawyer Lord Lester agreed, saying that \"I don't want to our judges to be editors \u2013 I want editors to be editors\" and argued that he wanted to see reform of the press regulation come from existing editors rather than from MPs and peers at Westminster. Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, clashed with Buscombe when he said that the PCC was \"a good mediation service, a good arbitration service, but it's not a regulator\". Interrupting him, Buscombe said that \"she didn't have the power\" to investigate the phone hacking story properly - and separately insisted that \"I'd never had my personal strings pulled\" by any of the newspaper groups that fund the PCC. However, it was Lord Prescott, who was the most voluble critic of existing press standards and regulation, complaining that \"the PCC code of conduct is voluntary, it is agreed with the industry and it is up to the industry to observe it\". Prescott cited the Telegraph's covert recording of Vince Cable at his constituency surgery earlier this year, as an example of where a newspaper assumed it was acting within the code \u2013 although it was eventually found to have been in breach. It fell to the editor of the Times James Harding, a News International title, to respond to the former deputy prime minister, saying subsequently that he \"understood that you're very cross, and I respect that, but that doesn't need to inform the future of press freedom\". Harding also conceded that the Times had been \"too slow\" to pick up on the importance of the News of the World phone hacking story until the Guardian revealed that the newspaper had hacked into mobile phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
