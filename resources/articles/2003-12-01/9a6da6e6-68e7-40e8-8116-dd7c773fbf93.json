Based on analysis of the most recent census, Britain's general union GMB said that more than 3 million men work 49 hours or more a week. In Kensington and Chelsea, as many as 42% of male workers exceed the EU's limit of a 48-hour working week. The City of London and Westminster are close behind, with 41% and 37% respectively. Least likely to work more than 48 hours are people in Belfast and Gwent, where only 14% of men do more than a 48-hour week. On average, women's working hours are far lower, due to a larger number of part-time workers and women taking time out to care for children. Only 5.8% of women in England and Wales work more than 48 hours. However, in Kensington and Chelsea and the City of London, that figure rises to almost one in five."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
