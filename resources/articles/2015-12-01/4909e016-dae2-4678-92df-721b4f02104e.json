The perfume costs around 6,000 roubles (\u00a357) for a 100ml bottle. It comes in a sleek black bottle featuring a profile of the Russian president\u2019s head and the words \u201cInspired by Vladimir Putin\u201d in English. \u201cIt\u2019s a warm scent, a textured scent. It\u2019s soft but at the same time it\u2019s very firm,\u201d said Vladislav Rekunov, the Belarus-born perfumer who came up with the scent. The perfume went on sale in Moscow\u2019s GUM department story on Thursday and can also be ordered online. Staff at the stand said orders had already come in from Germany and China, and they were also hoping to present a bottle to Putin himself. A limited edition of 2,000 bottles has been prepared, and the makers hope a female version will follow in the new year. Some of the sale proceeds will go towards helping disabled children. According to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, the perfume has notes of lemon, bergamot and blackcurrant. \u201cTo start with it is rather citrusy, but then the aroma opens up you you can feel its forest-like core \u2013 pines and fir cones. Finally there is musk and mung beans,\u201d a perfume consultant told the newspaper. \u201cWomen like the fragrance even more than men.\u201d The perfume could be the perfect gift for the Putin fan who already has a Putin T-shirt, mug, fridge magnet and iPhone cover, all of which are available in Moscow shops."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
