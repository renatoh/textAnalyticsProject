The damning findings by the US justice department (DoJ), set to be officially announced on Wednesday, identify a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of unconstitutional conduct in the city. The justice department launched its investigation into the city\u2019s policing a month after Freddie Gray\u2019s death last year. Gray, a 25-year-old African American man, died a week after he was arrested from a spinal injury sustained while he was held in the back of a police van. The city erupted in weeks of unrest, including numerous mass demonstrations against police brutality and a day of rioting. The report found a vast racial disparity in enforcement, especially in stops, searches, and discretionary misdemeanor arrests. African Americans, for instance, account for 91% of \u201cfailure to obey\u201d and trespassing charges, and over 80% of charges such as making a false statement to an officer or disorderly conduct, even though they account for roughly 60% of the population. African Americans were arrested for the possession of drugs more than five times as frequently as their white counterparts, although drug use, the report notes, is roughly the same. Justice department officials found that residents believe there are \u201ctwo Baltimores\u201d, including \u201cone wealthy and largely white, the second impoverished and predominantly black\u201d, the report reads. \u201cCommunity members living in the City\u2019s wealthier and largely white neighborhoods told us that officers tend to be respectful and responsive to their needs, while many individuals living in the City\u2019s largely African-American communities informed us that officers tend to be disrespectful and do not respond promptly to their calls for service. Members of these largely African-American communities often felt they were subjected to unjustified stops, searches, and arrests, as well as excessive force.\u201d The report documented extensive evidence of these perceived racial disparities. It found that over a five-year period, African Americans accounted for 95% of people stopped by police more than 10 times. One African American man, according to the report, was stopped 30 times in less than four years. \u201cDespite these repeated intrusions, none of the 30 stops resulted in a citation or criminal charge,\u201d the report states. This finding falls into a nationwide debate about unfair traffic stops of African Americans after the deaths of Sandra Bland in Texas last year and Philando Castile in a Minnesota traffic stop last month. Although Castile had been stopped 46 times, only six of those were for offenses that an officer could have seen before stopping the car. The report \u201creveals a widespread pattern of BPD officers stopping and detaining people on Baltimore streets without reasonable suspicion that they are involved in criminal activity. This conduct violates the fourth amendment.\u201d In one case, while DoJ officials shadowed officers on patrol, a supervisor advised a patrol officer to \u201cmake something up\u201d in order to justify a stop. The report shows that training and supervision within the department are so lacking that often officers\u2019 own reports fail to provide a justifiable reason for stopping a citizen, frequently relying on judgment of a \u201chigh crime\u201d area or fear for \u201cofficer safety\u201d. In one example, officers stopped an African American man for wearing a hoodie and putting his hands in his pockets on a cold January evening. \u201cAlthough there was no basis to detain the man, two officers attempted to handcuff and shackle him, while one officer struck him \u2018in the face, ribs, and back\u2019 with fists,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe man continued to resist being shackled as additional officers arrived, one of whom tased the man twice to prevent him from \u2018escap[ing] the scene\u2019.\u201d Ultimately, the man was not charged and although the supervisor noted that the man had been beaten and shocked with a Taser, \u201cthe sergeant\u2019s report of the incident concluded that the \u2018officers showed great restraint and professionalism\u2019\u201d. In one of the most overt examples of racial bias, a supervisor sent a sample report for trespassing arrests to a sergeant and patrol officer with many blanks to be filled in, \u201cincluding the arrest data and location and the suspect\u2019s name and address, but does not include a prompt to fill in the race or gender of the arrestee. Rather, the words \u2018black male\u2019 are automatically included in the description of the arrest. The supervisor\u2019s template thus presumes that individuals arrested for trespassing will be African American.\u201d The report traced these police practices back to the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies of the late 1990s, which \u201cled to repeated violations of the constitutional and statutory rights, further eroding the community\u2019s trust in the police\u201d. Although the report notes that the police department has made progress, it is clear that the \u201clegacy of zero tolerance enforcement continues to drive its policing in certain Baltimore neighborhoods and leads to unconstitutional stops, searches, and arrests\u201d. The report concludes that \u201cBPD\u2019s systemic constitutional and statutory violations are rooted in structural failures\u201d. In finding that the department violated rights guaranteed by the constitution, the DoJ\u2019s conclusions were similar to those in its report on the Ferguson, Missouri, police department, which began following the death of Michael Brown. That investigation resulted in a consent decree agreement between the Department of Justice and the city of Ferguson that laid out a series of mandated reforms. In Baltimore, the DoJ says it is already working with the city to \u201cforge a court-enforceable agreement to develop enduring remedies to the constitutional and statutory violations we found\u201d. Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake asked for the justice department review last year in the wake of Gray\u2019s death. After a series of violent months in the city and a scathing \u201cafter action\u201d report that condemned police handling of the riots that followed Gray\u2019s death, Rawlings-Blake fired the then police commissioner, Anthony Batts, and replaced him with Kevin Davis. Six officers were also charged in Gray\u2019s death. But after a mistrial and three acquittals, prosecutors dropped the remaining charges. At a press conference on the report, Rawlings-Blake said there was no connection between the trials of the officers in the Freddie Gray case and the DoJ report. But state\u2019s attorney Marilyn Mosby saw a direct link between the reforms that the department has already undertaken \u2013 such as a new use of force policy that favors de-escalation and cameras in the back of police vans \u2013 to the trials of the officers. \u201cWhile the vast majority of Baltimore city police officers are good officers, we also know that there are bad officers and that the department has routinely failed to oversee, train, or hold bad actors accountable,\u201d Mosby said. \u201cSince the death of Freddie Gray, a number of reforms have been put in place as a result of the prosecution of the six police officers.\u201d Police commissioner Kevin Davis said that action had already been taken to remove officers involved in the most egregious incidents, noting that he has fired six officers so far in 2016. But he identified with citizen outrage over the findings. \u201cWe know that our citizens are outraged at some of the details included in this report. And they should be. Citizens can\u2019t be expected to respect an agency if the trust of that agency is breached,\u201d said Davis at the press conference. \u201cThis report is not an indictment of every man and woman who has the privilege of wearing this uniform, this patch, and this badge. This report is however an indictment of those bad behaviors by a relatively small number of police officers over many, many years. There are officers right now that are just as offended to see the details that are laid out in this report.\u201d Local activist group Baltimore Bloc says that the report is a \u201cverification of our daily life in Baltimore\u201d and an indictment of the city\u2019s failed leadership. The report strongly condemns the department for violating \u201cthe First Amendment by retaliating against individuals engaged in constitutionally protected activities\u201d. \u201cIt troubles me to read how frequently the Baltimore City Police Department has engaged in various disturbing patterns or practices, including excessive use of force and unjustified and severe disparities in the rates of stops, searches, and arrests of African Americans,\u201d congressman Elijah Cummings said in a statement. \u201cThe statistics are simply astounding, and the unconstitutional violations of our citizens\u2019 rights are unacceptable.\u201d Sherrilyn Ifill of the NAACP\u2019s Legal Defense Fund, called the findings \u201cdevastating\u201d, adding that: \u201cthe city\u2019s residents will need a few days to absorb the findings in this unsparing report. But then it will be critical to begin the hard work of ensuring that this federal investigatory process yields real and lasting change in Baltimore.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
