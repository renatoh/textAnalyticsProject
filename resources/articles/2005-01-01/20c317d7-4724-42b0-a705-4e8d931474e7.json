Well, perhaps not speechless: the ebullient founder of the comedy troupe Gross National Product is not a man frequently lost for words. But here in the oldest saloon in Washington DC, with its air of quiet power-brokering, many of those words are pessimistic. GNP's latest revue is entitled Son of a Bush, Simmons not being an admirer of the current incumbent of the White House just across the road. 'You have no idea just how disillusioned people in north-east America are,' says Simmons. Actually, I think we have. But the irony is that when George W. Bush is sworn in for a second term on Thursday, he'll inherit not just a divided country but a capital city which has so far largely ignored him. DC is having a moment - but it has precious little to do with the current administration. In recent years the city has been transformed. Run-down areas have been cleaned up and renovated; an economic boom has sent property prices soaring, and DC, once nicknamed 'Deserted City' at night, has now put more police on its streets than any other city in America. But the credit for this lies not with Dubya but with Mayor Anthony Williams, a Democrat, now in his fifth year of office. Local voters, they'll tell you with some passion, were more than 90 per cent behind John Kerry. In any case, the real revolution has been at street level. Tourists have been flooding into DC: more than 20 million last year, 900,000 of them from the UK. They come for the monuments and the museums - but also for the hip new hotels, the scores of new bars, restaurants and clubs, and the distinctly laissez-faire attitude that emerged during the years of President Bill Clinton and has never disappeared. Some 200,000 people attended DC's gay and lesbian Capital Pride march last year, which can hardly have gone down well with the neo-cons in the White House. You sense this new mood on arrival. In the lobby of Hotel Rouge there's Pop Art on the walls, retro furniture and Sean Paul drawling on the sound system. The Rouge's look is best described as hi-tech bordello. My deep crimson room has a flat-screen computer, but also zebra-print bathrobes and a minibar containing flavoured condoms. Downstairs the staff offer complimentary mid-morning Bloody Marys. Not quite what you'd expect from a city of Republican-suits, and this is just the start. Strolling down U Street I call in for a hot dog at Ben's Chili Bowl, whose booths and Formica tables have catered to the local black community since 1958. The place is packed. U Street, once known as 'Black Broadway', has been off limits to tourists for decades. Now it's a vibey den of soul-food restaurants and jazz clubs, rechristened the 'New U'. Likewise the Penn Quarter, north of DC's famous Mall. This was once a ghost town after dark; now at midnight clubbers in baggy hip-hop clothes rub shoulders with the after-theatre crowd at 7th Street's many restaurants. Perhaps this renaissance is unsurprising when you consider the city's social mix. 'You've got politicos, lawyers, interns, students and diplomats,' said one bartender. 'These people mix across party lines, and they like to get out and meet each other.' And now they have more choices. In affluent Georgetown I ate at Mie N Yu, a resolutely eclectic restaurant that resembles a Moroccan souk. Dinner was Indonesian satay followed by steamed Japanese vegetables; cocktails were industrial-strength; conversation was loud and risqu\u00e9. Somehow it was hard to imagine President Bush enjoying Mie N Yu. 'He's like a fish out of water in this town,' said the guy at the next table. 'The Clintons were out and about in the city all the time, and they kind of set the tone. Bush spends all his spare time on his ranch. He's very removed from what's happening here.' True. But Washington is never far removed from George Bush, or any other president. No other US city carries such an enormous burden of political symbolism. Since 11 September, foreign visitors can no longer tour the White House, and the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument are fenced off. But there are two important additions to the Washington landscape, and each has a different resonance. The first is the National Museum of the American Indian, which opened last September. This tells a moving story of struggle, deprivation and near-genocide. 'It's about survivance,' writes Native American author Gerald Vizener. 'Survivance is more than survival. Survivance is about redefining ourselves.' The second new attraction is the WW2 Memorial, which also opened last year. This too proves controversial, but for other reasons. While the water features and columns commemorating the 400,000 US war dead are moving, some of the inscriptions seem crashingly gung-ho given the Iraq situation. 'We are determined that... our flag will be recognised throughout the world as a symbol of freedom on the one hand and overwhelming force on the other,' proclaimed General George C. Marshall in 1942. Sound familiar? But on a bright Sunday morning, with the sun glinting on the Potomac river, politics seems a long way away. At the Eastern Market in the Capitol Hill district - until recently another dodgy area - the covered food hall, built in 1873, was crammed with exotic foodstuffs. Outside was a flea market selling everything from reggae CDs to model planes. An elderly man played a saxophone; people walked their dogs; parents strolled by with kids. At an outside table I ate eggs Benedict and reflected on the ironies of this week's inauguration. All that hoopla for Bush in a city that was 90 per cent opposed to his election. But Washington is a town used to tolerating unwelcome out siders. Bold, sassy and hipper by the day, DC will continue to march to its own drum. Even comedian John Simmons, in his gloom, had admitted as much. 'There's so much going on in DC, why just look at the place politically?' he said. 'This is a great, great city. When it comes down to it, who gives a f*** about George Bush?' Factfile Paul Mansfield travelled to Washington with Virgin Holidays (0871 222 0306). Three-night breaks at the Hotel Rouge cost from \u00a3519pp room only, including flights and transfers. An upgrade to Virgin's Upper Class costs from \u00a3865pp each way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
