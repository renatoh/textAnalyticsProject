At the height of the space race, American air force and navy pilots reckoned a successful marriage was essential if you wanted to be part of the Apollo programme. But being the wife of a rocket-jockey could be a fraught, lonely affair. You were given no psychological preparation for the pressures you would face and, when your husband was shut away training (or actually taking that one small step), you were pursued by the media like some 1960s Wag. The unlucky ladies talk about those days in The Astronaut's Wives Club (11am, Radio 4): how they found a place to chew the fat and get support when their relationships suffered. Meanwhile on Bognor pier, people are throwing themselves into the sea while dressed as chickens, pantomime cows and grand pianos. The one who flies the furthest will win up to \u00a325,000. This is the annual Birdman of Bognor competition - the background to Sarah Daniels's Afternoon Play (2.15pm, Radio 4). Marcia Warren, Emma Fielding and Philip Jackson star."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
