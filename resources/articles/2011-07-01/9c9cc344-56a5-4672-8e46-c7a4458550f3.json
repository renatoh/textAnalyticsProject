Image: Dan Logen, 1 February 2011 [velociraptorize]. Nikon D300, 600 mm lens, ISO 800, f/9, 1/640 sec Question: This non-migratory monomorphic mystery bird, which is endemic to the highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea, is a member of a family of birds that are exclusive to the Old World. This small bird is often heard, rarely seen. In fact, these birds are best identified by range and song. You have seen a congener of this species as a mystery bird, so it is possible that some of you can identify this bird's taxonomic family, and possibly even its genus. Response: This is an adult Ethiopian cisticola, Cisticola lugubris, a grass warbler species that is best identified on the basis of its voice rather than appearance (I think its song is reminiscent of the buzzing part of a grasshopper sparrow's song). This cisticola has a black back (thus its alternative common name) with rufous wing panels and a grey tail with prominent sub-terminal spots and white tips on the retrices. Originally thought to be a subspecies of the winding cisticola, Cisticola galactotes, this species was recently elevated to full species status based on vocal and plumage differences, although additional genetic research is required.
