The boy was shot on an evening walk with his father and the family's dog along a footpath by a golf course near Castleford, West Yorkshire, where the practice is illegal but has been regularly reported in recent months. Neighbours in Castleford called for tougher action against gangs who use high-powered torches or car headlights to mesmerise their prey before killing them. Lamping claimed another young victim last month when Byron Evans, 13, was shot by his stepfather in Devon during a legal night-time hunt. The latest victim, who has not been named, was taken to Pontefract general infirmary after the shooting at 8.30pm. A spokeswoman for West Yorkshire police said: \"He and his father had been walking their dog on a path near to Whitwood Technical College, which backs on to Whitwood golf course. \"They were distracted by a bright light and the boy cried out. His father turned to discover his son had received a gunshot wound. Due to the seriousness of this incident police are keen to trace anyone who may have been in the area at the time.\" Lamping is legal on private land with the owners' permission, provided the guns are all licensed - the position at Little Cholwell farm in Harberton, where Byron died. Dorset police believe that he was mistaken for a fox when his eyes reflected the light. In August a lamper was cleared of assault at a court hearing after a leading nature writer, Trevor Lawson, was shot in the chest while out looking for barn owls. Anthony Burns, 52, from Prestwood, Buckinghamshire, mistook Mr Lawson's night-vision binoculars for a fox's eyes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
