The more fundamental cause is surely the structural reforms undertaken by the coalition government. Switzerland is not in the EU and yet ETH Zurich is going from strength to strength. Outside Europe, the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University (where I work) have shot up the rankings partly because the national government has invested, the universities don\u2019t have to chase the tuition fees of overseas students, and the universities\u2019 missions are tied into national development. Whether or not the Brexit vote is ever enacted, there is nothing to stop the UK following a similar path. Scott Anthony Singapore \u2022 I could not help but notice that under the headline \u201cBritish universities plunge again\u201d \u2013 note, not \u201csome British universities\u201d \u2013 four out of the top 10, or 40%, including Manchester, actually rose up the rankings. This fact is not referred to in the story itself, with a narrow focus on Cambridge. I am sure that the Guardian can do better than this and find room to celebrate as well as commiserate. By the way, I am not an academic but do live in Manchester.
