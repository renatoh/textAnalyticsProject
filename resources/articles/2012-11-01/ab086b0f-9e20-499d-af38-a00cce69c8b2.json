While the penny pinchers would scale back on the good we can do in this world, the DoH looks at the map and presses ahead. Hence a conference on Thursday: Current Issues in Global Health. Sad, of course, that health secretary Jeremy Hunt won't be there, but there are compensations. For scheduled is Ken Clarke \u2013 minister without portfolio, envoy for trade \u2013 who will speak in the session Trade for Health, drawing, no doubt on his 10 years at British American Tobacco, a stint reported to have made him \u00a31m. He resigned as deputy chair in 2008, but he can reflect that the titan he helped to build now operates in 180 countries. If they feel healthier \u2013 aside from the 6 million killed by smoking each year \u2013 that may be because of Ken. \u2022 Trepidation in Labour ranks as it is confirmed that Lynton Crosby, the Aussie election attack dog, will mastermind the next Conservative election campaign. Doors slam, windows rattle, pets howl. If there are weak spots Crosby, the force behind Boris Johnson's two election victories in London, will find them. One wonders if Ed Miliband feels the need to have a word with Helen Goodman, the shadow culture minister. Her brief would seem to encompass the web and its benefits, such as broadband. The problem is that she doesn't seem to know very much about it. Blogger Terence Eden flags up an exchange between Goodman and experts giving evidence to an inquiry on filters and online protection. \"I'm sorry, maybe I'm particularly stupid,\" she said. \"But I haven't understood how I get this software or this kit or whatever it is, this filter thingy that you click or whatever without buying a new computer, and I don't want to spend a thousand pounds just to have a filter. I just haven't understood what I do, and you've been talking to us and I've been in this room for half an hour.\" You can download parental control software for free, said the expert. \"But I don't know how to download parental controls,\" cried Helen. \"I can send an email, I can click on to Windows but the minute you talk about downloading software, my brain goes bzzzz.\" Oh dear. Remember, Crosby takes no prisoners. \u2022 More on the unpleasantness between the website Independent Catholic News and senior staff at St Mary's Catholic college in south-west London. Last Friday we reported that journalist Jo Siedlecka had one week, by order of the high court, to name the anonymous author of a letter to which three senior college officials, including the principal, Prof Philip Esler, took legal exception. Four days left, but she's not budging. Over the weekend Prof Esler withdrew from the legal action, citing his fear of \"reputational damage\" to the institution. The other two will, however, press ahead. Someone may lose, but no one's going to win. \u2022 The die was cast. The date was set. Television journalists Mark Daly of BBC Scotland and Alex Thomson, chief correspondent for Channel 4 News, were due to face the ire of Rangers fans, having exposed the shenanigans that resulted in the team being demoted to the Scottish third division. Brave pair, thought fans, as they signed up for the Media Monday event at Edinburgh Napier University on Monday. But both cried off: Daly must complete a quickly commissioned Panorama, and Thomson is stuck in Gaza. He's a lucky guy. It's safer for him there right now. \u2022 Finally, a tale for our times. It concerns the publication Education for Liberation, a little-known product of the Socialist Teachers' Alliance. Education for Liberation is not a super soaraway kind of title. But adherents like it. Last week Alex Kenny received a consignment containing the latest edition at his home in London. Six heavy boxes, each containing 200 copies, were left in the front porch. \"Unfortunately, some time between 4pm and 5pm, two boxes disappeared. It would appear that they were stolen by members of Walthamstow's criminal fraternity.\" But that's the thing about stealing boxes: one never really knows what is inside. \"At 7pm, on returning from the local shops,\" reports Alex, \"I found the missing two boxes, one open, neatly stacked by the front gate.\" All copies apparently returned. It's a miracle. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
