Without an inquiry these shameful revelations will linger on and shame this country's reputation. To be credible the inquiry must be in public and take evidence from former British detainees and especially from Shaker Aamer, the one remaining British detainee still languishing in Guant\u00e1namo, after eight years without charge or trial. The Bush administration conceded in 2007 that it had no evidence against him. Shaker Aamer is in extremely bad health due to the harsh conditions and the particularly vicious torture he has experienced. As the longest remaining British detainee in Guant\u00e1namo his evidence could be vital to this inquiry. He should be returned to Britain urgently and reunited with his British wife and their four children.
