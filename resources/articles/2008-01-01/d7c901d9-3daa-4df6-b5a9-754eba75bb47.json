The 73-year-old is a benign minimalist who benefits from being steered away from simple prettiness into stranger, more unsettled waters. In the 1970s, he formed Cluster with Dieter Moebius, and the pair proceeded to work with both Neu!'s Michael Rother (as Harmonia) and Brian Eno. Following 2003's Lunz, American composer Tim Story is again doing the steering, and with a much bolder hand, shading Roedelius's neo-classical piano meditations with cello, oboe and pensive electronics. Intermittent Haiku has the same nostalgic, rain-blurred synth tones as Boards of Canada; Downrivers is underscored by a tachycardiac tick like a malfunctioning clock; Beforst is a luminously textured marvel. This is a record to set alongside 1977's Cluster &amp; Eno, but also Air and Aphex Twin: beautifully eerie, a world unto itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
