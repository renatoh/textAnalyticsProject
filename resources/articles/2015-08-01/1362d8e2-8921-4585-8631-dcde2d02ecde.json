Tuesday evening in Sweden will determine how costly that wastefulness will prove. A tie Celtic should have pushed out of sight within 45 minutes is delicately poised with 90 to play. Jo Inge Berget, not so much an ineffectual loanee at Celtic last season as an anonymous one, afforded Malmo increased hope of a Champions League place with a goal in the fifth minute of injury time. It marked Berget\u2019s second strike of the match, an obviously wounding twist of fate for the Celtic manager, Ronny Deila. As Deila well knows, only progress on this stage can endorse or otherwise his tenure. \u201cYou feel you could get something more from the game tonight,\u201d Deila said. \u201cThey scored with the two chances they had but we have to see how it is after two legs. They have to beat us in Malmo. We are very irritated with the last thing that happened in the game but we have to move on and know we are ahead.\u201d Age Hareide, Deila\u2019s counterpart at Malmo, said his team are now the favourites to progress. \u201cWe will attack them at home and play our normal game and hopefully it will be enough. We saw Celtic against Inverness [on Saturday]. We know they don\u2019t have the legs for 90 minutes,\u201d he said. A dig towards his fellow Norwegian manager? You bet it was. Champions League football has a relevance to Celtic way beyond Deila\u2019s reputation. That much was highlighted by the vibrancy of the atmosphere a the kick-off. Even by this famous venue\u2019s history, the intensity was notable. On the field, Celtic\u2019s start could not have been more emphatic. Malmo were given no chance whatsoever to settle, with the Swedes finding themselves a goal behind before enjoying any meaningful possession in Celtic territory. Leigh Griffiths scored the opener and in doing so supplied justification of Deila\u2019s decision to start him in attack. A slick move on a drenched pitch carved open the Malmo defence. Stuart Armstrong produced a surging run before feeding Stefan Johansen. The midfielder played in Griffiths, who had the simplest of tasks in sliding the ball past Johan Wiland. Malmo, inside three minutes, did not so much look rattled as terrified. The lead was promptly doubled. Johansen was again the provider, this time with a corner that Nir Bitton met inside the six-yard area. Griffiths was again significant, having caused suitable distraction on the goalline. Even with 10 minutes played, and with Malmo\u2019s recent experience of turnarounds in European competition, it looked impossible to make any case for the Swedes hauling themselves back into this tie. They had been battered aside by Celtic\u2019s energy and tempo. And this, strangely, a Swedish team far more immersed in their season than is the case in Scotland. It took 22 minutes for Malmo\u2019s first attempt of note. When it arrived, Craig Gordon did well to scramble a Vladimir Rodic effort round the post. Any visiting encouragement from that would be readily offset by the glaring element of panic every time Celtic crossed the halfway line. Still, Malmo\u2019s decent spell and occasional moments of poor communication in the home defence served as a warning to Deila\u2019s men to box clever. They did nothing of the sort seven minutes into the second half. Celtic wasted a corner before cheaply conceding possession through their captain, Scott Brown, in midfield. Malmo\u2019s Magnus Eikrem subsequently swung a cross into the penalty area that eluded everyone apart from Berget at the back post. The former Cardiff player supplied a clever finish on the half-volley, that rendered Gordon helpless. Celtic\u2019s vulnerability had been exposed and Malmo, now full of confidence, were transformed. Berget\u2019s previous Glasgow frustration was settled in one swing of his right boot. More was to follow. Griffiths was soon on hand to restore the two-goal advantage and settle palpable home nervousness. The striker, hardly renowned for his aerial prowess, did terrifically well to outjump Anton Tinnerholm and loop a header past Wiland. The ball crossed the line via the goalkeeper\u2019s right-hand post. The tenacity alone shown by Griffiths was worthy of a goal. Now was the time for Celtic to stick rather than indulge in anything reckless. The energetic Griffiths was replaced by Nadir Ciftci, with more concern apparent as Mikael Lustig was carted from the pitch on a stretcher after collapsing in a heap without challenge. No fourth goal was forthcoming for Celtic; Malmo and Berget supplied the dramatic intervention. The midfielder looked like he rather enjoyed it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
