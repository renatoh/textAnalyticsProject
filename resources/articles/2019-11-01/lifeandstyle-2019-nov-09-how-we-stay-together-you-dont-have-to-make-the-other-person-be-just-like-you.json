Even a good collaborator will feel the initial urge to push back, but \u201cwhat really makes the difference \u2026 is not someone who doesn\u2019t have that emotion, but someone who knows how to manage it\u201d. It\u2019s the same in relationships: \u201cHilary and I are extremely different and our secret [to] how we stay together, and stay together happily, is our ability \u2013 that we\u2019ve learned little by little over the last couple of decades \u2013 to manage that.\u201d The couple have collaborated from the start. They met in 1997 in New York, where the Sydney-born Bell was doing a postgraduate playwriting course at Juilliard and Johnston had been living and playing music for years. Both signed up for a two-week musical theatre workshop that paired up composers and writers with actors to create songs, with the trios rotated for variation. Bell and Johnston were drawn together romantically but they didn\u2019t work together until the final group. Their singer had just found out she was pregnant so she asked the pair to write a lullaby for her unborn baby. The pressure was on: \u201cWe knew that we really liked each other, but if our relationship was going to have any future we had to write a really good song,\u201d Johnston says. \u201cIf we wrote a bad song, then it was all over.\u201d The resulting lullaby was called Upon the Waves and apparently it was a hit. \u201cI think I can say there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house,\u201d Johnston says. \u201cShe loved this song [and] I think it\u2019s one of the best things I\u2019ve ever written. It worked out for the couple too \u2013 they have been together for more than 22 years and have two children of their own. After eight years in New York, the couple settled in Sydney in 2005. In conversation they bounce back and forth, often finishing each other\u2019s sentences. That first collaboration set the pace for the pair. Johnston encouraged Bell, as the librettist, to write the lyrics first, then he responded with music. \u201cI think that\u2019s illustrative of a lot of the things that work in our relationship,\u201d Bell says, \u201cYou let me set the course a lot of the time.\u201d \u201cI let you have your own way a lot of the time,\u201d Johnston retorts with a smile. After those first intense creative weeks, the couple were inseparable, even though they are quite different. There is an age gap of more than 10 years, they come from different backgrounds and they had very different attitudes to life. \u201cI was much more, \u2018Well we can\u2019t do that because we\u2019re not allowed to,\u2019\u201d Bell remembers, \u201cAnd Phillip was, \u2018Fuck it, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\u201d At that stage, Johnston says he\u2019d had a \u201cmore complicated life\u201d. And when Bell\u2019s parents met him for the first time, she remembers they were somewhat \u201cbewildered\u201d. She says: \u201cPhillip was such a sort of foreign entity to them. He was a jazz musician. He\u2019d been around the block a few times. He was older than me. He\u2019s American as well, so I think that they just kind of thought, \u2018Who is this person? Is he really going to be part of our family?\u2019\u201d But their connection was undeniable, Bell says: \u201cAs soon as we met, it just felt like this was the future.\u201d When Bell\u2019s US visa ran out, they decided to get married. It was \u201ca no-brainer\u201d, even if it happened sooner than planned. There was one caveat: Bell knew she\u2019d want to go home to Sydney one day. \u201cIt was pretty early on. I said, \u2018So could you imagine moving to Australia?\u2019 And he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know where it is, but sure.\u2019\u201d Their decision to have children was just as straightforward, Bell says. \u201cThere are these things that you think of as massive life decisions \u2013 and I\u2019m an incredibly indecisive person \u2013 but for those milestones, they just seemed like, \u2018Oh, yeah, this is what we do next\u2019.\u201d Their relationship did change once their two children came along, but what helped was that they shared the child-rearing. This was particularly true given the ups and downs of creative life. \u201cWhoever has work, works; whoever happens not to have as much did the bulk of the cooking and picking them up and all of that.\u201d Now both successful in their own right, the couple have continued to collaborate and support each other in their work. As artists, they understand each other. \u201c[Artists] worry about all sorts of things [while] the rest of the world doesn\u2019t understand why that matters,\u201d Bell says. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t worry about things that other people seem to think are important. And so there\u2019s no need to sit down and explain to each other.\u201d Their creative lives are constant so they have each other to lean on: \u201cWhat we do is what we love and it\u2019s interesting to us, and sometimes of course, it\u2019s problematic. But also, when we\u2019re having problems with other collaborators around our projects, Phillip can completely understand and identify with what I\u2019m talking about and help me solve problems and give good advice.\u201d Having someone in a similar industry helps to weather the ups and downs of a creative life. \u201cIt\u2019s great that there\u2019s always someone to walk the dog,\u201d Bell says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s always someone making money,\u201d Johnston adds. Although the couple have similar values and agree on religion and politics, they have very different artistic tastes, Johnston says. \u201cWe often come out of a movie or a play and one says, \u2018That was the worst play I ever saw.\u2019 And the other says, \u2018That was the best play I ever saw.\u2019\u201d They have learned not to take it personally. \u201cInitially, especially when you\u2019re getting to know each other, you want to turn each other on to things you love,\u201d Bell says. \u201cSo when that didn\u2019t really work, it was hard not to be offended by it. Now, it\u2019s kind of funny and it\u2019s even more surprising if we both liked the same thing.\u201d Johnston agrees: \u201cWhen we find something [and] we think, \u2018The other person might like this one thing,\u2019 we present it that way, very gingerly. \u2018I think this is actually something that I like that you might like\u2019 \u2013 but it usually isn\u2019t.\u201d They also have quite separate social lives too, with only a few mutual friends. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s strange. Like when it was Phillip\u2019s 60th birthday, I put together this book of tributes from his friends and I didn\u2019t know a lot of them,\u201d Bell says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have their phone numbers or addresses and so I had to go on this undercover research to get to them.\u201d Johnston adds: \u201cAnd some of them said quite insulting things about me, which is one of the ways you could distinguish my friends with Hilary\u2019s friends.\u201d Having different artistic tastes isn\u2019t that important, Johnston says. \u201cThe issue of whether you feel the same way or differently is not as important as how you deal with that difference [with] tolerance and you can generalise it to what\u2019s going on in the world in a big way. The important thing is not how people think about things, but how they deal with the differences. If you look around the world, it seems like people are having a harder time tolerating people who are different from them.\u201d Considering their differences taught him an important lesson about relationships, Johnston says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make the other person be just like you.\u201d Bell agrees: \u201cThe flipside of that is loving the fact that they\u2019re not just like you and that they can open your eyes to things that you would never come across on your own ... Not just books or art or whatever, but ways of looking at things or people that you wouldn\u2019t normally think about talking to.\u201d Even when they disagree, Bell says, they keep their cool. \u201cWe never shout. We\u2019ve never called each other a name and even if you\u2019re really upset about something, you never forget that that\u2019s the person you love, and you never seek to undermine their dignity.\u201d She often looks to her parents who have been together for 54 years and considers what they would do in a similar situation. \u201cJust coming from a background where the assumption is love, respect, dignity, listening, that makes it much easier to perpetuate that way of treating a person.\u201d Their commitment to each other has remained unshakeable. \u201cOnce you do commit to somebody, you don\u2019t wake up each day going, \u201cAm I still committed?\u201d You just don\u2019t even question it.\u201d As Johnston puts it: \u201c If you\u2019re committed, you don\u2019t let minor things get in the way of your commitment.\u201d And Johnston\u2019s is the final word of advice on how to stay together: \u201cDon\u2019t be a jerk.\u201d \u2022 We want to hear your stories about staying together.
