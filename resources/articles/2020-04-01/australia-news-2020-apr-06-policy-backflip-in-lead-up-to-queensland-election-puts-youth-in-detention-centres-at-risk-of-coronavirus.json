The state\u2019s human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, said without urgent attention, he thought it \u201cinevitable\u201d that children would again be \u201cwarehoused for prolonged periods\u201d in police watch houses \u2013 a situation that provoked outcry about their treatment and prompted reforms of the youth justice system. \u201cLast year we saw children held in adult watch houses in some cases for weeks on end,\u201d McDougall told Guardian Australia. \u201cOn the present trajectory we are rapidly approaching the same situation and the Covid-19 pandemic brings another layer of complexity to this crisis.\u201d In 2018, Guardian Australia reported concerns about children being held in watch houses for extended periods due to overcrowded detention centres. The ABC\u2019s Four Corners program last year revealed that children as young as 10 had been housed in police custody alongside maximum security offenders. The program prompted significant reform by the Queensland government and its approach was praised by human rights groups. It established a separate department for youth justice and announced initiatives to keep children out of detention and watch houses. Last month the government made an about-face policy pivot: it announced a new \u201chard line on youth crime\u201d approach that aimed to place more children in detention. This was partly a response to vocal campaigning by local media in Townsville, where Labor seats are considered vulnerable at this year\u2019s state election. In its announcement, the government said it would take \u201ctougher action on bail\u201d including seeking to keep more children on remand, and a \u201cpolice blitz on bail\u201d to appeal court decisions. \u201cThese are changes our MPs in Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and the Gold Coast have advocated and the government has acted,\u201d the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said. This week, there are 223 children in youth detention centres; significantly up from late last year, when the initial youth justice reforms were starting to take effect. There are 258 youth detention beds in Queensland, but it is unclear whether these are all available, as ongoing expansion works at the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre had temporarily reduced its capacity, and these works are ongoing. Human rights advocates with knowledge of Queensland\u2019s youth detention system say the \u201csafe\u201d capacity of these centres is below the total bed numbers, as crowded facilities limit the ability of authorities to separate detainees of different ages and risk profiles. Crowding is often also considered a contributing factor to incidents in youth detention centres. On 18 March, a disturbance occurred at the Townsville centre that involved three boys climbing on to the roof. McDougall said the overwhelming majority of children in youth detention were from Aboriginal families, and many were accused of offences while living in unstable residential care arrangements. \u201cThe situation calls for intensive resources to be made available to Aboriginal controlled organisations to assist the safe return of children to Aboriginal families and kinship carers. Aboriginal voices need to be heard in the process of finding creative solutions to this pressing crisis.\u201d Concerns about \u201chard line\u201d policies disproportionately affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and broad powers given to police to enforce public health regulations. Amnesty International Indigenous rights campaigner Lidia Thorpe said detention often took children out of safe environments with family. \u201cLocking them up is putting them at more risk, given we\u2019ve seen already this virus has got into prisons. Because of the overcrowding it puts kids or anyone at more risk of getting the virus. \u201cThe safest place for these kids is at home.\u201d Thorpe was critical of the government\u2019s youth crime shift, which she said fed into a narrative that promotes racist attitudes towards Aboriginal people. \u201cI think we have to keep in mind the Queensland election is coming up and unfortunately when we do have progressive governments in power, it becomes a race to the bottom on law and order. We\u2019ve seen this around the country where we\u2019ve had Labor governments in power. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to suggest that when we see a child misbehaving that the best thing for that is to lock them up and isolate them. If this was happening to non-Aboriginal kids we would see an outrage in this nation, but [because] it\u2019s happening to Aboriginal people it\u2019s like it\u2019s expected.\u201d The office of the state minister for child safety, youth and women, Di Farmer, said in March there were an average of seven young people a day held in police watch houses \u2013 down from 34 in March 2019 \u2013 and that the vast majority of those were waiting for a court hearing or processing. \u201cThe average number of days spent in a Queensland police watch house since January 2020 was two days, which reflects the significant transport arrangements required for transfer from remote and regional communities,\u201d a spokesman for the minister said. \u201cThe government is investing $177m in new youth detention centres beds, which includes the expansion of Brisbane Youth Detention centre with 16 new beds due to come online in May, and construction of a new 32-bed youth detention centre at Wacol. \u201cThis investment means state-wide capacity will increase from 258 beds to 306 beds by the end of this year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
