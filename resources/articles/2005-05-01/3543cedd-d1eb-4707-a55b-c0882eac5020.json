A large pubic wig, explains Rory Bremner. \"Have you seen one? Presumably you wouldn't know if it was a good one\u2026\" It's under discussion at the Hay Festival for a reason; one that only really becomes clear when you hear the impressionist in full George W Bush mode, declaring patriotically in Texan that he's \"proud to be a merkin.\" Bremner's gags are usually a bit more squarely political; in the last decade he's moved from light entertainer to fully engaged political satirist. He and colleagues Bird and Fortune take the research seriously, he says: \"Before you make nonsense of politics, you have to make sense of it.\" And he's still very funny: something that seems lost on his interviewer at Hay, James Naughtie, who repeatedly interrupts before the punchline and steadfastly refuses to laugh at his jokes. Interestingly, Naughtie also seems oblivious to the giant screen behind him, on to which his features are being projected up close like a glaring Magwitch, fingers teasing the edge of his nostrils. What, asks Naughtie, would Tony Blair say to you if he was here now? In fact, says Bremner, the last time they spoke was in 1996, when he warned Blair that from now on they'd be making jokes about him. To which the future PM asked: \"How does Lord Bremner sound?\" The audience laughs, but this time Bremner doesn't look like he's joking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
