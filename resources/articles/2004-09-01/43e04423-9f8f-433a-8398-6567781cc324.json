Fly-half Wilkinson, favourite to captain England in their November Tests against Canada, South Africa and Australia, booted 13 points in a comfortable away victory. The injury-time sending-off of Newcastle back row forward Phil Dowson could not disguise a quality Newcastle performance that saw them score four tries and claim an important bonus point. By the time Dowson left, after a punch-up of both packs, Newcastle were home and dry as they built on their victory over Premiership new boys Worcester last weekend. With Wilkinson in the driving seat, Newcastle blew Bath away inside the opening 26 minutes as flanker Mike McCarthy, Tom May and Michael Stephenson capitalised on sloppy Bath defence. With Wilkinson kicking two conversions and a penalty during that early onslaught, Bath still had a mountain to climb despite lock Steve Borthwick crashing over from close range. Bath fly-half Chris Malone slotted a penalty before the break, and even though Newcastle had lock Luke Gross yellow-carded they were in total control approaching the second period. Wilkinson landed the first-half of a drop-goal double on 56 minutes to ease Newcastle's nerves and although that heralded Bath's best spell of the game, there was no way back for the home side. Bath wing Brendon Daniel scored two tries during the final quarter, but his contribution was disrupted by May's second try which made the game safe. Referee Steve Lander imposed discipline in the closing minutes after a brawl which owed much to Bath's frustration. Dowson was shown a straight red, and he can now expect a minimum three-week ban, while May was sent to the sin-bin.
