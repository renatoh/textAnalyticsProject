New figures issued on Friday showed that Aldi has leapfrogged Waitrose to become the UK's sixth-largest supermarket, dealing another blow in a relentless campaign against the retail establishment by discounters that has seen the departure of Tesco's chief executive this month. \"We are in a period of unprecedented investment and this will have an impact on the profit we report next month,\" said Waitrose managing director Mark Price. \"We are investing to enable us to compete effectively in this very tough market and to build a strong business for the future.\" Earlier this year, Price said that Waitrose would not be slashing prices to compete with the discounters, but wanted to become \"everything the discounters aren't\". There are plans for 30 \"grazing\" bars where shoppers can enjoy deli food or freshly baked cakes, and investing in matching the prices of its main rivals, such as Tesco, which have been making price cuts. It will also offer special deals to members of its MyWaitrose loyalty card scheme. It has 4.5 million members, up from fewer than 1 million a year ago, after it began offering free tea or coffee on every visit to the store. But Waitrose said the scheme was not responsible for the half-year drop in profits because the business was investing less in MyWaitrose than this time last year. Price said Waitrose had ended the half-year strongly after suffering a few tough weeks in which sales fell back year-on-year as it struggled to top a strong period in 2013 when it was offering special money-off vouchers. Sales for the week to 26 July were up 6.7% on a year before, well ahead of the general grocery market. Full details of the group's first-half results are scheduled to be revealed on 11 September. A year ago the business reported a 13% rise in operating profits to \u00a3160m. Price's revelations about the likely profits hit for Waitrose this year come as the latest market share data shows Aldi is now the UK's sixth-largest supermarket. Market analysts Nielsen found Aldi controlled 5.2% of the market compared with Waitrose's 5% in the 12 weeks to 19 July. Nielsen said that the discounters were being visited by 14% more people than a year ago as Aldi and Lidl continue to outperform the market with sales increases of 25% and 17%, respectively. A spokeswoman for Waitrose said it was still gaining market share and was not losing out to the discounters. \"This is a story of the squeezed middle, with Aldi's gains coming almost entirely at the expense of the big four. We continue to outperform the market and have more customers than ever before,\" she said. But Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said that fresh food such as fruit and vegetables were now emerging as a new battleground with Aldi and Lidl, which were beginning to tackle an area that traditional supermarkets, especially Waitrose, have dominated. \"The discounters have been very effective at stealing share for packaged goods \u2013 such as cans, packets and bottles. If they can also eat into fresh foods, which account for almost half of food and drink sales, we could see a seismic shift in the sector over the next six months,\" he said. The big four supermarkets have already been forced to cut prices on basics such as bread and milk, with Morrisons promising \u00a31bn of price cuts and product improvements over the next few years and Tesco slashing more than \u00a3200m from prices so far this year. While Asda and Sainsbury's have managed to retain their market share and Waitrose continues to gain, Tesco and Morrisons are in retreat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
