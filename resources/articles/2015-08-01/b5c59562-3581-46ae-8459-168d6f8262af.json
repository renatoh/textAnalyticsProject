The suspect, who has not been named, has a criminal record for rape and assault, Rodolfo Rios Garza told reporters. Two other suspects remain at large. Espinosa, who fled the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz in June after being threatened, was tied up, tortured and shot in the head in an apartment in a middle-class neighbourhood on Friday. Also killed were his friend Nadia Vera, a social activist, and two of her roommates - a 19-year-old student and an unnamed Colombian woman - as well as their 40-year-old housekeeper. The murders have sparked widespread protests and international condemnation of the spiralling violence against journalists in Mexico. Veracruz, where 13 journalists have been murdered and three others disappeared since 2011, is the most dangerous place to be a journalist in the Americas, according the press freedom group Article 19. Espinosa\u2019s friends and colleagues believe he was targeted because of his work covering social movements and protests, including the violent police clampdown on students just before he fled Veracruz. But investigators have so far played down the possibility that the attack was linked to threats received by Espinosa or Vera, who left Veracruz last year fearing for her safety. Vera, 32, was an active member of the anti-corruption social movement #YoSoy132 in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz, whose protests Espinosa had regularly covered. She reported several incidents of police brutality before leaving the state in 2014 to work as a cultural organiser in the capital. Late last year, she posted a video warning that if anything happened to her, it would be the fault of governor Javier Duarte. Espinosa had also publicly linked the governor to the murder of journalists. Duarte issued a brief statement lamenting the \u201cabhorrent\u201d massacre, but previously he has blamed the murders of Veracruz journalists on personal vendettas, and recently accused some reporters of being involved in organized crime. His administration has jailed two bloggers and threatened to jail a photographer for exposing self-defence groups in the state. But investigators say all lines of investigation remain open, including robbery despite the evidence of torture and execution-style killings. Espinosa, 31, had told friends that he thought he was being followed in Mexico City. He had described two separate incidents where he was approached by strangers who asked if he was the photographer who had fled Veracruz. As a security measure, Espinosa maintained regular contact with friends and family via text messages so that they knew he was OK. The last message he sent was at 2.13pm on Friday, when he told a friend that he had slept late after staying up all night talking and drinking, and that he was about to leave to work for the AVC photo agency. On Tuesday, prosecutors released video from a street security camera showing three suspects leaving Vera\u2019s apartment less than an hour after Espinosa\u2019s message. The footage, timestamped 3.00pm, shows one man walking away with suitcase, another man leaving in a red Ford Mustang. A third man is seen running across the street five minutes later. The bodies were discovered several hours later by another flatmate. Neighbours have said they did not hear anything unusual that afternoon. If the men caught on camera are the attackers, it means they tortured, bound, raped, killed and packed a suitcase full of stolen items in less than 50 minutes. Authorities said that they do not know exactly what was stolen. Investigators today also released the name of the registered owner of the red Mustang \u2013 which they say was in possession of the Colombian victim \u2013 used as getaway vehicle by one of the suspects before being dumped a few miles south. The same weapon was used to kill all five victims and is not linked to any other crime, prosecutors confirmed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
