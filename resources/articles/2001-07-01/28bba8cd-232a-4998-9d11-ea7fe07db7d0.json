Avid supporters of the All England Tennis Club can wear their heart on their credit card thanks to Halifax. It launched its Wimbledon affinity card back in 1999 and will be heavily promoting it during British sport's most famous fortnight. But do affinity cards offer users a good deal? The Wimbledon card comes in three varieties - gold, platinum and standard. The annual percentage rate (APR) on balance transfers is 4.9% on the gold and platinum versions and 5.9% on the standard card. Interest on purchases is 16.9% on the upmarket cards and 17.9% on the bog-standard version. There's no annual fee and an interest-free period of 59 days. The card gives fans the chance to support grass-roots tennis, but details of how this works are sketchy. A spokesman for Halifax refuses to disclose exactly how much money is handed over to the All England Club when you use your card. However we are told a donation is made every time you make a purchase. Other affinities The Wimbledon credit card is one of a wide range of affinity cards on the market. The market leader, Bank of Scotland, has more than 500 on offer, with causes ranging from major charities such as the NSPCC and the British Red Cross, to football clubs and universities. It even has cards for fans of James Bond and Elvis. The deals cut with each organisation vary, but the bank's manager of affinities, Chris James says: \"In general, the organisations involved will have an income generated from the card.\" When looked at on a card-by-card basis, the amount given to charities seems pretty meagre. People's Bank's Comic Relief card, for example, pays \u00a35 to the charity on first use, but just 0.60% of any purchase thereafter. A cardholder making a first purchase of \u00a350 will benefit the charity to the tune of \u00a35.30, but subsequent spending will raise money at a rate of just 6p per \u00a310 spent. However, these small amounts add up and Comic Relief says it has already received over \u00a3100,000 from the scheme. And, according to a spokeswoman for Moneyfacts: \"When people choose an affinity card they are more interested in the donation than the interest rate.\" A good cause? If you pay off your balance every month, this type of approach to choosing a card is all well and good. But if you keep a balance on your card, then looking at the donation rather than the rate could cost you, and the charity, dearly. Some affinity cards do have good rates: the NSPCC card, for example, has a rate of just 9.9% for the first year, putting it on a par with that offered by Intelligent Finance. But if you want to back the work of English Heritage you'll dive straight into an APR of 18.9%. Keeping a balance of \u00a31,000 on the card will set you back \u00a3189 a year, compared to \u00a399 on the Intelligent Finance visa. English Heritage will receive \u00a313 from a \u00a31,000 purchase, assuming it's a first spend - \u00a376 less than had you taken the cheaper card and handed over the difference to the charity. Affinity cards do have a certain amount of appeal. \"Some people like to display an organisation's logo,\" says Mr James. \"They like to show their allegiance to a body. They like to be able to donate as they spend.\" Affinity cards let you do all that, but if you just want to maximise your donation and minimise your spending, you are probably better off setting up a direct debit to your chosen charity and choosing a cheaper card. In the case of tennis fans, you'll probably need that extra money for the price of strawberries they serve at Wimbledon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
