Many in the City fear the worst as the company is heavily exposed to the buy-to-let market, which experts say is hugely overheated. Yet Paragon continues to prosper, its share price trading near an all-time high of 313p. Recent figures were good. Chief executive Nigel Terrington points to the growing number of divorces and single households, and the fact that prospective first-time buyers are renting because they cannot afford to purchase. These are trends that should continue to work to Paragon's advantage. For a company that almost went bust in the early 1990s, Paragon has undergone a transformation and is riding high as a mid cap mortgage lender specialising in buy-to-let homes. It recently bought Britannic Money, another buy-to-let specialist, for \u00a318.7 million, viewed as a knockdown price by brokers. Martin Cross, an analyst at broking firm Teather &amp; Greenwood, says: 'The acquisition clearly benefits Paragon's buy-to-let mortgage business by increasing its size by 50 per cent.' It was all so different a decade ago when, under its previous name, National Home Loans, Paragon nearly went under during the 1991 recession. NHL grew rapidly in the bull market of the Eighties. High interest rates and rising unemployment caused default levels to rise and with falling house prices there was little security to compensate. Paragon's financiers, mainly banks and local authorities, cancelled their funding arrangements. The situation became so serious that the Bank of England had to organise emergency funding for the group's banking operation. Former management was replaced in 1992 and the new team, headed by Jonathan Perry as chairman with Terrington as chief executive, remains intact today. By 1995 the renamed Paragon recommenced its lending, specialising in buy-to-let mortgages. Paragon's mortgage book has grown to more than \u00a31.8 billion. It also branched out into car finance in 1997 and personal lending with the acquisition of Universal Credit from Lloyds TSB in 1998. Although Paragon has diversified, its focus has increasingly been on secured residential mortgage lending. With Britannic Money, the total assets of Paragon are now some \u00a35bn, of which a significant proportion is secured residential mortgages. 'The acquisition of Britannic Money brings together two major buy-to-let lending organisations, with complementary distribution channels giving considerable scope for growth,' says Terrington. But with some economists forecasting the end of the buy-to-let boom, has Paragon bought Britannic at the wrong stage in the buy-to-let cycle? Terrington argues that changes in demographics and Government housing policies will result in the private rented sector's share of the UK's total housing stock continuing its growth path of recent years. Further, the absence of first-time buyers from the mortgage market is also helping to boost the buy-to-let market. According to The Centre for Economics and Business Research the buy-to-let market is set to grow by 40 per cent by 2012. Terrington is equally convinced of the underlying credit quality of buy-to-let customers and points out that Paragon's buy-to-let arrears stand at a fraction of normal commodity mortgages. Shareholders have bought into this optimism. Much could go wrong, but there is no sign that investors are bailing out.
