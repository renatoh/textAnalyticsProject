I had a lot of freedom, but there was a lot of drama. It was a childhood of extremes. I was bullied by my history teacher. He\u2019d say, \u201cWell, your grandmother is a fascist [Diana Mitford, wife of Oswald Mosley], so you\u2019re getting a D in this essay,\u201d and I was like, \u201cWhat does that have to do with it?\u201d I didn\u2019t retrench into just thinking, \u201cOh gosh, they\u2019re just being mean to me.\u201d I went to Auschwitz. I went to the Holocaust camps. I did a lot of deep research, which was pretty heavy in my teens. But it was something I needed to resolve to understand why I was being bullied. It took me a long time to realise that I didn\u2019t have to be defined by the place that I came from. I try not to look in the mirror. I\u2019m very, very hard on myself. I\u2019m not someone who thinks I\u2019m completely fabulous. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always disguising myself. David Bowie had a wonderful sense of humour. He was funny, clever, disarming and very interested in what everybody had to say. We frequented the same secondhand bookshop in New York. I was happy to know that I wasn\u2019t the only person that was so obscure. It\u2019s hard to say how many pairs of shoes I own. Probably hundreds. Most of them are in storage. In between making music and making visuals, I\u2019ve neglected to figure out where I actually live. I haven\u2019t had a Guinness for a really long time. Alas, I don\u2019t get it free, but my dad worked for the brewery until the late 80s, so we did get a large case at Christmas. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s where my hair comes from. I almost died three years ago. I collapsed in the studio, was rushed to hospital and they had to remove something in my intestine. I was 10 hours on the operating table and they didn\u2019t think I was going to make it. What I did feel was that it wasn\u2019t the end of the world to die. Is there a God? I absolutely believe that the spirit goes into this great sort of beyond and there is an afterlife. Making music is the most fun I\u2019ve had. I\u2019d trained as a soprano, but hadn\u2019t done anything with it. I\u2019ve got three albums now. Life throws things in your way and you either embrace them or you can avoid your destiny. I suck on Nicorettes all day long, the ones that look like Tic Tacs. Although I\u2019ve not had a cigarette in 18 years, nicotine helps me think. Salvador Dal\u00ed was my childhood neighbour. I had no idea he was such a famous artist. I just thought he was a friend of my mum\u2019s who lived in Cadaqu\u00e9s. When I wrote at school about what I did in my summer holidays, they handed it back and said I was lying. I was in lockdown in LA for seven months. It\u2019s been a nightmare living in America, because of the politics. You couldn\u2019t get away from it. Being in LA in May with all the protests and dissatisfaction was awful. Not only were we under lockdown, but we were under curfew, too \u2013 alarms were going off every hour. It was like something out of a science fiction novel. I\u2019ve lived long enough to know that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around me. How would I like to die? I\u2019d like to know that I was dying. I would like to be conscious when I\u2019m dying. I think it\u2019s an important step. Daphne Guinness\u2019s Revelations is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
