The strike by more than 30,000, followed by two further days of disruption, comes as Belgium's La Poste \u2013 and other continental operators \u2013 have been linked with buying the up-to-30% stake in Royal Mail to be auctioned by the UK government. Belgian unions are incensed that Danish Post, one of those interested in buying into Royal Mail, is selling its 24.9% stake in La Poste to private equity firm CVC Partners for \u20ac373m (\u00a3330m) \u2013 earning a profit of more than \u20ac200m in three years. CVC, in turn, sold its 22% stake in Danish Post to the state-owned Swedish operator. The Danish operator, which is merging with Sweden's Posten, paid about \u20ac150m for its stake in a joint venture with CVC in 2006 that took 50%, minus one share, in La Poste. The Belgian state owns 50% plus one share and must approve any change in the ownership structure. Yesterday Piet van Speybroeck, La Poste's chief spokesman, said of reports that La Poste would bid for the Royal Mail stake: \"I have absolutely no comment to make.\" It is, however, more likely that the Danes will team up with CVC to bid for the holding. Others in the frame are the Swedes, Germany's part-privatised Deutsche Post and TNT of the Netherlands, the front runner. The main British postal workers' union, the CWU, is understood to have warned the chief executives of all these and other potential bidders that his union will \"strongly oppose\" any move by them to buy into Royal Mail. The warning comes in a confidential letter from its leader, Billy Hayes. The EU's postal market will be fully open to competition in 2011 and Belgian unions fear this could hasten trends to cut costs by shedding labour and/or moving staff onto part-time or temporary contracts. That process has accelerated since 2006, when the Danes and CVC formed their consortium. Van Speybroeck told the Guardian: \"We deplore that the strike has been launched which is bad for customers and is taking place even before negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement to cover the next few years have begun. \"There have been many changes in the past seven years and it's hard for people to accept more in future. We understand the feeling of general dissatisfaction but there's no alternative. We have got to change as we're not fully ready for 2011 and EU liberalisation.\" La Poste reported operating earnings (before exceptionals) of \u20ac162.7m in 2007 and is due to announce its 2008 results in April. In recent days Sweden's Posten has declared annual operating profit last year of Skr1.9bn (\u00a3147m), Deutsche Post an operating loss of \u20ac567m after huge losses and restructuring charges at its US business and TNT an operating profit of \u20ac982m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
