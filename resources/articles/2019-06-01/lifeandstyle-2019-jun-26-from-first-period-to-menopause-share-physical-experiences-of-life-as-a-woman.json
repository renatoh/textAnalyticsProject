Is there a physical experience you\u2019ve had as a woman that has had a significant effect on your life \u2013 good or bad \u2013 and that you consider to be underreported? We\u2019d love to hear your stories, positive or not, affecting, angry or humorous, from your first period to the menopause and beyond. One in five girls and young women in the UK are teased or bullied about their periods, yet some women view menstruation as a \u201cfeminine power\u201d. Ten per cent of women consider leaving their jobs due to menopausal symptoms, while for other women the hormonal shift is a liberating experience. Share your experiences From the highs of sexual pleasure and discovery, to the lows of illness, infertility and abuse, we want to hear about women\u2019s experiences with their bodies from birth to old age.
