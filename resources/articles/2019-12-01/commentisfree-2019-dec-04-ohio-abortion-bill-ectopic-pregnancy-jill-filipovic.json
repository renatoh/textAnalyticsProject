But it is real. And it\u2019s dystopian \u2013 a sign of the disturbing push from the \u201cpro-life\u201d right to treat women\u2019s bodies as incubators, no matter what the physical toll. The law would criminalize abortion and make it punishable by life in prison; \u201caggravated abortion murder\u201d would carry the death penalty. That\u2019s right: \u201cpro-life\u201d lawmakers in Ohio want to throw women and girls in jail for life, and even execute them, for ending their pregnancies. It\u2019s troubling that this even needs to be said, but because legislators in Ohio apparently don\u2019t know: you cannot re-implant an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies are potentially life-threatening complications where a fertilized egg implants itself somewhere outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. As the cells multiply and the embryo grows, it can burst the tube, causing serious and potentially deadly complications. As a result, the standard of care for ectopic pregnancies is to dissolve the fertilized egg. Some self-styled \u201cpro-life\u201d healthcare providers refuse to do even this, and will instead remove part or all of a woman\u2019s fallopian tube. The embryo still dies, and the procedure is more complicated, but hey, they didn\u2019t directly \u201ckill\u201d a fertilized egg. It\u2019s this logic that Ohio\u2019s anti-abortion legislators seem to be following: that a fertilized egg is a life, and therefore, it\u2019s impermissible to remove it. So why not have a doctor scoop it out and stick it in a woman\u2019s uterus? Because, well, you can\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s no procedure for it, and it\u2019s not so easy to move microscopic fertilized eggs around, especially when they are implanted and growing in a woman\u2019s body. Doctors can certainly try \u2013 and in doing so, put their patients through serious and unnecessary surgery, and put them at risk for catastrophic hemorrhage. That\u2019s the choice that these Ohio legislators would force on healthcare providers: put your patients at risk for a made-up procedure that cannot and will not work, or face the rest of your life in jail. As for women, well, the bill treats them as mere incubators, not fully-fledged human beings who may object to having their organs sliced open and their lives put on the line so a doctor can go through the motions of pretending to save an egg. Under the terms of this bill, a person may also face execution for \u201caggravated abortion,\u201d which more or less means performing an abortion while also committing another serious crime. Bad news, I suppose, for anyone who enjoys combining abortion and bank robbery. And lest you think that this is the invention of one or two deranged imbeciles in Ohio\u2019s legislature, the bill has 19 co-sponsors \u2013 one-fifth of Ohio\u2019s house. Even if this bill passes and is signed into law, it\u2019s so blatantly unconstitutional that it won\u2019t go into effect \u2013 at least not until Roe v Wade is overturned. But that\u2019s the plan among abortion opponents: push laws that put women at risk so often, and make those laws so extreme, that overturning Roe seems like a foregone conclusion, not a decision that will leave American women (and people who care about women) up in arms. And set the stage for a national anti-abortion takeover: if Roe is overturned, anti-abortion forces will be as committed to letting states decide their own abortion laws as they are to not putting women in jail for abortion \u2013 that is, not at all. Expect a full-court press to outlaw abortion at the federal level, women\u2019s lives or medical reality be damned. The Ohio law is fully divorced from reality. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s misogynist. And it\u2019s where the United States is heading."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
