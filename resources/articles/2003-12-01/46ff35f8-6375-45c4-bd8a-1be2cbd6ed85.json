Not before time. Both main London houses have had indifferent years - predictably in ENO's case, surprisingly in Covent Garden's, given the goodwill and excitement generated by the arrival late last year of the popular, gifted Antonio Pappano. With Raymond Gubbay throwing a mischievous spanner in the operatic works at Easter, by offering mid-price, mainstream works in English at the nearby Savoy, both ends of WC2 had better look urgently to their laurels. Presented this year in two separate halves, soon to be united in one long, exciting evening, Richard Jones's US-imperialist version of Berlioz's The Trojans promises to be another highlight of a make-or-break year for ENO under its new artistic director, Sean Doran. Doran and his financial advisers have sensibly scheduled a few bums-on-seats revivals - not including, I am as pleased as unsurprised to report, the work responsible for my worst night out of the year: The Handmaid's Tale, Poul Ruders' adapta-tion of Margaret Atwood's novel, in a staging by Phyllida Lloyd verging on the desperate. After re-runs for Jonathan Miller's elegant Der Rosenkavalier and David Alden's unexceptional Tristan und Isolde, ENO offered its best work at the Barbican, theatre as well as concert-hall, laying itself open to two unwelcome suggestions: that the Coliseum is not the best display-case for its smaller-scale, more intimate work, and that surtitles are now indispensable for opera in English. The first was proved beyond dispute by Sam West's stylish Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte and David McVicar's potent Rape of Lucretia, the second by everything, wherever - not least the last two 'public rehearsals' for Paul Daniels' mouth-watering Ring cycle in Jeremy Sams' sleek but inaudible new translation. Covent Garden kept making the mistake of letting designers direct - as in Charles Edwards' Elektra and Robert Wilson's A\u00efda, and the French duo of Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier, let loose on Madama Butterfly, La Cenerentola and Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet. Sets alone do not an opera make, as was also proved by the revival of Francesca Zambello's Don Giovanni, especially when they fell down. The best memories of the Bow Street year, apart from its Sondheim Christmas cracker, were Dawn Upshaw's debut in The Cunning Little Vixen, the thrilling Russian recreation of Nijinsky's choreography for The Rite of Spring and welcome revivals for John Copley's high-camp Semele and Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant I Pagliacci - a lavish vehicle for Pl\u00e1cido Domingo as both singer and conductor. Not for the first time, the regional companies seemed to be trying harder, with Welsh Opera scoring hits with Jephtha and Parsifal, and Opera North with its 'Women on the Edge' trilogy (La Traviata, Rusalka, Manon). But the operatic achievement of the year was Scottish Opera's majestic Ring cycle, finally seen in full after a serial unveiling, which should scoop the forthcoming round of awards, richly deserved by director Tim Albery and conductor Richard Armstrong. In any other year, Glyndebourne's magical Tristan und Isolde would have won all palms, for Nikolaus Lehnhoff's exquisite staging as much as the fine performances of its two young principals, Robert Gambill and Nina Stemme, under the masterful baton of Jir\u00ed Belohl\u00e1vek. Poor Simon Rattle was meanwhile landed with a Peter Sellars staging of Idomeneo so perverse that the music got all but drowned out; how weird that Sellars's six-year-old Theodora was, by contrast, the other highlight of the Sussex season, along with David McVicar's spruced-up La Boh\u00e8me, alongside a feisty Figaro and a frothy Fledermaus. The other country houses struggled to keep up, with Garsington scoring one hit out of three - memorable Mozart after wrecked Rossini and strangled Strauss - while Grange Park managed vivid Verdi before grim G&amp;S and shameful Chabrier. Both could learn from London's own country-house opera, Holland Park, which staged a formidable Fidelio, tense Tosca, vivacious Werther and luscious L'Arlesiana. In a forgettable year for contemporary opera, the only one with a chance of survival was Simon Holt's Who Put Bella in the Wych-elm?, slickly staged at Aldeburgh and the Almeida. Aldeburgh also hosted a duly majestic concert performance of Britten's Gloriana, a lone musical nod to the Coronation anniversary, while Graham Vick followed up his 'People's Fidelio' in Birmingham with an equally engaging Candide. The Barbican's Ligeti weekend, climaxing in his opera Le Grand Macabre, was the highlight of a mixed year for contemporary music, still apparently as intent on alienating its audience as winning converts; only new pieces by Julian Anderson, Harrison Birtwistle and Peter Maxwell Davies stood out, alongside the continuation of last year's enterprising George Benjamin festival. Indian summers for Sir Charles Mackerras and Sir Colin Davis, primarily with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and LSO respectively, made many other conductors sound routine, though Mikhail Pletnev gave a memorable Rachmaninov series and Murray Perahia galvanised the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. Despite a vintage Proms and an enterprising Edinburgh, the festival of the year was the South Bank's celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of Prokofiev's death, with Vladimir Ashkenazy in charge of programming his music alongside select Shostakovich. The QEH hosted an enterprising Monteverdi weekend, climaxed by a suave Miller staging of Orfeo. The often underrated Philharmonia and LPO regularly proved themselves as polished as their Barbican counterparts, the LSO and the BBC Symphony. Especially welcome visitors to the Barbican were William Christie and his Les Arts Florissants, notably in a semi-staged version of Handel's Xerxes with Anne Sofie von Otter. But 2003 may ultimately be remembered as the year that music finally grew up on television, with the invention of a new genre, the docu-opera, in Penny Woolcock's thrilling Channel 4 film of John Adams's The Death of Klinghoffer. C4 also caused a stir with the success of its 'reality' series Operatunity, launching careers of some sort for the winners, Denise Leigh and Jane Gilchrist. Battersea Arts Centre, meanwhile, unveiled a potential successor to Jerry Springer - The Opera in Newsnight - The Opera. All the more reason for the big-time houses to raise their game.
