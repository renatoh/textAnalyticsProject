The retired teacher, aged 60, bludgeoned his wife Carol to death with an ice axe then dumped her body in bags in Coniston Water, in the Lake District, in July 1976. The body of the mother of three remained there for 21 years until divers found it in 1997, still in a blue baby-doll nightdress. Today, a jury at Manchester crown court rejected Park's defence that he was a loving husband, and that Carol had run away with a \"mystery lover\". Detectives say that, as Park remained at liberty and successive murder teams toiled without any DNA, other physical evidence or witnesses, he must have believed that he had carried out the perfect crime. Even when the jurors were considering their verdict after a ten week trial, he had confidently told reporters he would be giving interviews after his release. Instead, he was tonight beginning a mandatory life sentence after being convicted by a jury of seven women and five men. The judge, Mr Justice McCombe told him he must serve at least 15 years. \"I am not sure there was a significant degree of planning ... there was, however, considerable violence,\" Judge McCombe said. \"I also have to take into account this terrible concealment of this body that led to so much suffering to so many people for such a long time.\" Park was led from the dock in a trance-like state, holding his hands out before him and grasping for the rail before being taken down. Earlier, as the verdict was announced, his son Jeremy sat with his arm around close family members. Park's third wife, Jenny, burst into tears. While giving evidence in his defence, Park had described the couple's early relationship as \"love's young dream\". He said that, on the day of her disappearance, the family had planned to take a day trip to Blackpool but that his wife had felt unwell and had chosen not to join them. He claimed he and the three children returned to the family home in Leece, near Barrow, Cumbria, which Park had built, to find Carol had vanished. The court heard she had been involved in a number of affairs with different men and that the couple had an unstable relationship and complicated love life. Both had been sleeping with other partners. When Carol vanished, Park told police about his wife's affairs and said she had simply left the family home and gone off with another man. Park had reported his wife missing - not to police but through his solicitor - on September 4 1976, six weeks after her disappearance. Officers initially carried out a routine investigation on the basis that she was a missing person. Park did not make any emotional appeals for his wife to return. Detective Chief Inspector Keith Churchman, the senior officer in the case, said his colleagues in 1976 had done all they could with what they had to work with at the time. \"No one was saying Gordon Park had killed his wife. It was dealt with as a 'missing from home',\" he said. Before the body was found by chance, the police's leads had amounted to nothing. The divers who discovered it were exploring a part of Coniston not normally used for diving because the water is extremely murky. The body had landed on an underwater plateau, 270 yards from shore and 80ft below the surface. If it had been dumped a few yards further from the shore, it would have sunk to the bottom, probably forever, police said. \"It was only by sheer luck she was found - he very nearly got away with it,\" one detective said. After the body was found, police descended on Park's home and his boat, the Mrs J, searching them as he enjoyed a cycling holiday in France with his third wife. He was arrested and charged with murder, but in January 1998 the crown prosecution service decided there was not enough evidence to bring a prosecution. Park, who had been in custody on remand, was freed, but the case was never closed. In 2002, Chief Inspector Churchman took over the investigation, looking at all the evidence as far back as 1976 to see whether anything had been missed. The process turned up new evidence. Analysis of the stones used to weigh down the body revealed they had come from Park's home. Detectives were contacted by Michael Wainwright, a fellow inmate of Park's when he was on remand at Preston prison. He told them of an alleged prison confession Park had made, admitting his guilt. Detectives went back to the CPS with the new evidence, and it agreed to run a trial. Park was rearrested and charged for a second time in January 2004. There was not one single piece of evidence that pointed \"indisputably\" to Park being the killer, the trial heard. However when taken together, the clues could only point to the defendant and not some \"mysterious stranger or secret lover\", prosecutor Alistair Webster QC told the jury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
