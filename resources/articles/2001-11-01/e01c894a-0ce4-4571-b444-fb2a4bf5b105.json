Janey Grace, the controller of CITV, said the only way to cope with a severe cut to next year's programme budget would be to show more repeats rather than commission fresh programming. The CITV budget recently suffered a cut of around 17%, to just over \u00a330m a year, and plans for an ITV children's channel have been dropped. \"I can't compete with the BBC any more for ratings with less than half its spend,\" Ms Grace told a Voice of the Listener &amp; Viewer Association conference on the future of children's television. Instead of commissioning expensive dramas, she now plans to experiment with low-budget formats such as documentaries and video-style diaries. Repeats would include drama series such as new series of My Parents are Aliens and Don't Eat the Neighbours. It is not clear how ITV will be able to meet its commitment to provide 75 hours of children's drama a year unless repeats are counted in. Ms Grace called for a complete revamp of the current commissioning system, whereby controllers only buy the rights to screen programmes. Instead, she said, ITV should establish a centralised children's unit that would operate in the same way as CBBC, owning all rights including merchandising. Only under such a system would CITV be able to pay its way, she said. The \u00a3300m fall in advertising income this year has led to ITV's owners insisting that the budget was concentrated on prime-time. \"When the chips are down the big boys want their money for peak times. All the minority programme areas (religion, regional) are being asked to make their contribution\" said Ms Grace. The CITV controller is one of a number of ITV executives going to see the independent television commission next week, as part of a lobby for cuts in annual licence payments totalling \u00a3300m. Some ITV executives openly question whether the network needs to make children's programmes at all, although they are a statutory duty at present. They also say the programmes should reflect the income they attract, rather than being subsidised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
