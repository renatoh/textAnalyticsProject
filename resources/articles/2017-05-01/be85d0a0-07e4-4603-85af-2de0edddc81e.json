An unlovely term that means giving one of your kidneys to a stranger. I\u2019d always known this was a thing but I\u2019d thought it was a bit weird, a bit excessive, like donating an arm. Why not just stick to blood donation? I\u2019d last come across the idea in Larissa MacFarquhar\u2019s 2015 book Strangers Drowning which had the alarming subtitle \u201cVoyages to the Brink of Moral Extremity\u201d. It\u2019s about ultra do-gooders who make normal people feel uncomfortable or worse. Which may be part of why they do it. MacFarquhar\u2019s subjects include people whose sense of the world\u2019s suffering leads them to give all their possessions away, live like vagrants, move to impossibly dangerous parts of the world. The help they provide for the poor seems questionable, but there is no doubt about the harm they do to themselves and those around them. Among these extremists are altruistic kidney donors. Many people, she says, \u201cparticularly doctors\u201d (she\u2019s writing about US doctors) find this donation \u201cbizarre even repellent\u201d. The brink of moral extremity did not sound like a place I wanted to go. In October of last year I was in the car with my wife and we were listening to a podcast in which a speaker used kidney donation as an example of a contract that can\u2019t be enforced. Almost irrelevantly he said people\u2019s queasiness about the subject isn\u2019t really rational: we don\u2019t need two kidneys, the operation is safe and the benefit to the recipient huge. I immediately thought: if that\u2019s true, it sounds like a good idea. When I got home I spent an hour online reading about kidney donation. I discovered that we can get by perfectly well on one kidney. If you donate a kidney, your life expectancy doesn\u2019t change. But what if you get a kidney disease, I wondered. The answer is that if you get a disease or eat certain poisoned mushrooms (as Nicholas Evans, author of The Horse Whisperer, did) it will affect both kidneys equally. The downside is an abdominal operation, but it\u2019s routine and so safe that it\u2019s even difficult to quantify the risks. In fact, it\u2019s comparable to the removal of an appendix, which has a death rate of one in 3,000. One of the problems of charity, of helping people, is assessing how much they are really helped. The result of receiving a kidney is just bloody obvious. Life on dialysis is debilitating, difficult, time-consuming. Receiving a kidney allows the recipient to return to normal life almost instantly and also doubles life expectancy. The economic results are pretty startling as well. The cost of a transplant is about \u00a317,000, while the average cost of dialysis is \u00a330,800 per patient per year. After the first year, the NHS gets a saving of over \u00a325,000 for every year the kidney continues working. By the end of that hour I decided to donate a kidney. The problem might have been the reaction of my wife and my children. If they had seriously objected or been upset, there would have been a difficult conversation and I don\u2019t know what the result would have been. In the event, they were startled but totally supportive. It took just a few clicks, one phone call and two days later I was sitting in the office of a specialist donor nurse at the Royal Free Hospital in London. At this point you discover that donating a kidney is both very easy and more difficult than you might think. You want to give it and the NHS really, really wants to take it. But they have to decide whether you\u2019re the right person to do this and that\u2019s a complicated process. The first person I met after the nurse was not a nephrologist (a kidney doctor) or a transplant surgeon but a psychologist. I spent an hour in an office explaining my decision. The purpose was basically to establish whether I was sane. The NHS wants your kidney, but it doesn\u2019t want it if you are giving it because you see it as making sense of a failed life, of giving away a bit of your body you consider worthless because you are worthless. That sort of thing. The psychiatrist got me to draw a family tree and talk about my relation to each person. Have I ever suffered from depression? Well, mildly, from time to time. Had I recently suffered a family loss? Actually, I had. My father had died the previous year, but I didn\u2019t feel it was related to the decision. But of course once you tell a psychiatrist that something is unrelated, it sounds like you\u2019re concealing something. By the end of the session I felt I was probably incapable of any decision, let alone donating an organ, but the psychiatrist pronounced me absolutely fine. He was more worried about people who didn\u2019t admit to weaknesses. I then went through a large number of examinations, including one epic day where I seemed to be plugged or inserted into every machine in the hospital, looking at my kidneys, my heart and lungs and, most ominously (considering what I\u2019ve done to it over the years), my liver. There were also enough urine and blood samples to do something that requires a lot of urine and blood. These tests eliminated about a third of potential donors. Another third change their mind. My final meeting was with an independent assessor, a doctor unconnected with the department, to make sure that I wasn\u2019t having the operation under duress or for money (both are criminal offences). This is a major issue in donation to family members but it scarcely applied to me. And then I was given the seal of approval. Next I was told that a perfect match had been found and a day was scheduled. I was told that the operation was going to be done by \u201crobotic renal surgery\u201d. You can look at this on YouTube. I did but you shouldn\u2019t. I think of kidneys as neatly arranged in anatomical models, or on a butcher\u2019s tray. (Unlike my family, I like eating them \u2013 as did Leopold Bloom in Ulysses who savoured their \u201cfine tang of faintly scented urine\u201d). A robotic operation may sound clinical, and I hoped it was clinical, but it looked like two prongs pushed into a shopping bag full of offal, hacking and cutting. But what did I know? And last week I had the operation. There\u2019s not much to say about that, except that, paradoxically, I went in well and came out ill. There was the delirious day of the operation, an uncomfortable hazy day after and I was home the next day. I was told that the \u201creceiving\u201d operation had gone perfectly and that he was a very nice man. That wasn\u2019t meant to be the point, but it\u2019s good to know. So, sitting here, slightly sore, five days later, what do I think of it all? First, it should be said, altruistic kidney donation is still rare. Until 2006 it was actually illegal in the UK. Since then there have been just over 500 operations. London\u2019s Royal Free hospital does about two a year. It seems \u2013 and I\u2019m curious about this \u2013 that giving away a part of my body that I don\u2019t need is less of a big deal to me than it is to many other people. Years ago, a friend of a friend suffered kidney failure. His father was a perfect match but ultimately refused to donate. He couldn\u2019t face the idea of the operation. It devastated the family. That shows the strength of the yuck factor. Personally, I\u2019ve told family and a few friends about it, but that\u2019s all. It\u2019s the same reason that I\u2019ve written this anonymously. People are complicated and divided about this. I am too. I wanted to do it without making a grandiose statement about myself or telling other people what they should do in any way whatever. However. Who should do this? Lots of people find the whole idea so creepy and repulsive that they couldn\u2019t consider it. Fine. Once we\u2019re past that, the main problem is the commitment. Kidney donation involves numerous hospital visits, a couple lasting a whole day, followed by a recommendation of four to six weeks off work. I was perfect for this. I\u2019m a self-employed writer. My time is flexible. My work involves thinking of things then writing them. I won\u2019t be back on my bike for a while, but writing this article shows that I\u2019m back at work. For many people that just isn\u2019t practical. One group who may not think themselves eligible but would (in my opinion) be suitable would be the recently retired. In fact, you can donate when in your 70s. Time on your hands? Want to do something helpful? It\u2019s worth thinking about. For myself, it was a strange six-month journey. I know the NHS and its staff face terrible challenges. I probably dealt personally with approaching a hundred NHS workers: nurses, doctors, surgeons, anaesthetists, porters, cleaners, students, radiographers, many others. They all must have their problems, but with me they were efficient, enthusiastic, highly professional and human. All of them. I felt genuinely privileged to be prodded, poked and examined by them. In the end I think it was a good thing to do, but it doesn\u2019t make me a good person. I\u2019m just muddling along, like everyone else. A couple of people said that I was being \u201cvery brave\u201d. I\u2019ve always tried to explain that if what I was doing involved bravery, I wouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place.
