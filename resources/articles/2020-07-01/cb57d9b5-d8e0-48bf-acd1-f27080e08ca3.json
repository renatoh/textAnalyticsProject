Aubameyang has scored five times in his past six games, including the double that defeated Manchester City and took Arsenal to the FA Cup final, but his future remains unclear and he stands to be a free agent in just over 11 months. Negotiations over an extension have not moved rapidly and Arteta outlined the added certainty an agreement would bring. \u201cWhen I was talking about the uncertain things that we have on the table, obviously he\u2019s one of them,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cWith Auba, I think I\u2019ve been very clear with what I want. The quicker we do it, for me personally, the better because the player will be more focused, more determined and more calm. But we have to respect the timings as well as the needs of the football club.\u201d Arsenal visit Aston Villa on Tuesday and wins in their final two top-flight matches would offer a good chance of Europa League qualification before the final against Chelsea. Arteta confirmed Mesut \u00d6zil was back in training and did not rule out a recall for the playmaker. \u00d6zil has not played since March, having been dropped and then sidelined with back problems. Matteo Guendouzi has been in a similar position, missing the past eight games and training alone for disciplinary reasons, but Arteta suggested both players could heed the example of Granit Xhaka, who seemed certain to leave in January but has bounced back. \u201cI think he is a really good example for any player that is in a difficult moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are willing and consistent and you really want to do it there is always a way back.\u201d Asked to confirm it applied to \u00d6zil and Guendouzi, he continued: \u201cThat applies for any player and any member of the staff. If you show that, that you decide to do the best not only for yourself but for the team and for the club, I think everyone will welcome you.\u201d The resolve Arsenal have shown in beating City and Liverpool has delighted Arteta, who detects his players are taking pleasure in showing a defensive steel that has not always been evident. \u201cI try to convince them that without that we cannot compete with the top teams at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we are willing to do that, and we do it throughout the game, we\u2019re going to give ourselves a big, big chance. \u201cThe fact of the trick here is that they\u2019re really enjoying doing that. If they do it because we have to push them to do it all the time, for me that\u2019s not the right way and we\u2019re not going to accomplish it long term. If they start to enjoy doing it together and be proud of it, and they can see the results and sense that unity, that is powerful.\u201d Arsenal have come under heavy criticism at times this season and Arteta, who faces Villa without the injured Shkodran Mustafi but welcomes back Eddie Nketiah and C\u00e9dric Soares, said he hoped they had used it as \u201ca challenge to put things right\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
