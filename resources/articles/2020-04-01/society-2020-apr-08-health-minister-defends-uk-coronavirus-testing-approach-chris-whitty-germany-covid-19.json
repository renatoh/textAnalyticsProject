Hancock will issue the plea on a conference call on Wednesday, echoing his call for help on ventilators, after the government conceded that none of the antibody tests it has are good enough for mass usage. Biotech companies will be asked to help identify and mass-produce a fingerprick test that is accurate enough to offer to the general population to see if they have had coronavirus. At the moment the UK is relying on laboratory tests to show whether a patient currently has coronavirus, and there is capacity to test 14,000 people a day \u2013 typically those in hospital, care homes or prisons, or NHS workers. The government is targeting 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, with both types \u2013 lab tests and fingerprick tests \u2013 making up the total. But it looks increasingly unlikely that an antibody test will be ready in time. Experts believe both types are needed to help at least partially end the lockdown and start returning people to work. The UK has been criticised for its slow start on ramping up testing. Edward Argar, a health minister, said on Wednesday that the UK \u201chasn\u2019t got the testing issue wrong\u201d, after Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said there were lessons to learn from Germany\u2019s high testing rate and slower increase in deaths. Argar, who toured the broadcast studios, said the UK recognised it needed to ramp up the number of tests being carried out but he downplayed the importance of Germany as a model to follow. He said the UK was seeing \u201crapid increases in testing\u201d and Hancock was determined to meet his target of 100,000 a day. Asked about Whitty\u2019s view that Germany had \u201cgot ahead\u201d on testing, Argar said there were other factors in the country\u2019s apparent success in flattening its curve. \u201cI would absolutely expect him to say we need to look at what other countries have done that has had a really positive impact,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cBut I would come back to his caveats in which he did also say there were a whole range of factors for why Germany\u2019s death rate does at the moment appear to be lower.\u201d He also repeated suggestions that the UK lockdown was likely to be extended next week, even though the government has refused to confirm that. \u201cWe need to start seeing the numbers coming down and that\u2019s when you\u2019re in the negative,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have a sense when that\u2019s sustained over a period of time, that you can see it coming out of that. We\u2019re not there yet and I don\u2019t exactly know when we will be.\u201d Experts have said the UK should not be coming out of the lockdown without developing a clear strategy for stamping out the virus through mass testing. Whitty, when asked on Tuesday about the differences with Germany, said: \u201cWe all know that Germany got ahead in terms of its ability to do testing for the virus, and there\u2019s a lot to learn from that.\u201d Germany is able to test 500,000 patients a week and is under pressure to increase this further. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had given a more circumspect reply, saying: \u201cThe German curve looks as though it\u2019s lower at the moment, and that is important, and I don\u2019t have a clear answer to exactly what is the reason for that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
