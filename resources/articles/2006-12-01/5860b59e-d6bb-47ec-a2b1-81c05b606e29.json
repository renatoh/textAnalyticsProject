At first it's glamorous and exciting - answering three different phones and shouting \"buy, buy\", \"sell, sell\" and \"you can't handle the truth\" at people. But, eventually, it leads only to colleagues asking you to order less stationery and respond more politely to inquiries after your health. By far the best option is to feign a whirlwind of activity while sitting at the eye of the storm downloading music, familiarising yourself with the political upheaval in the Democratic Republic of Congo (on Wikipedia) to impress people at dinner parties, and sending emails with the subject line \"I'm bored\". It is vital that your computer screen faces away from anyone who might be concerned with what you're doing. Fight for these vital desks - he who Hotmails with impunity wins the day. Sending emails has the bonus that your face, hands and eyes move exactly as those of a person deeply engaged in putting together a report. Booking a holiday, by contrast, involves a good amount of scrolling, picture-gazing and phoning people with clearly leisure-related phrases such as: \"It says five minutes from the beach, but is that in a car or on foot?\" It is, therefore, only suitable for looking busy when your colleagues are far away. The mobile phone is not your friend. It speaks of decadent, nay extravagant, slacking such as arranging nights out or, worse, merely ringing someone to chat. Use only when nipping out on false pretences; consider pretending you smoke and get 40 minutes a day extra outside the building using the mysterious licence the nicotine-addicted get. Other great get-out-of-jail-free cards include carrying around random, yet important-looking, pieces of paper and referring to them periodically. At intervals, uncap a pen dramatically and tick something in such a pantomime fashion that even a dead person might realise you'd achieved some success. Electricians have been known to bed down among the insulation in hollow ceilings, safe in the knowledge that they can, if questioned, claim to be adjusting wiring. This principle can be applied to other areas of the office. Meeting rooms can always be employed, with the spurious statement that you were looking for somewhere quiet to get through some tough reading. When cossetted in their soundproof confines you can do what you like, up to and including inflating a bouncy castle, without fear of reprisals. If you're forced to remain at your desk, make sure the debris thereon looks suitably eager. Leaving Mars Bar wrappers or well-thumbed copies of Country Life gives the wrong impression to someone walking past. Make sure a graph is always on your screen when you pop out, and write yourself Post-Its with important phrases on them. The ultimate way to look busy is, of course, to get promoted to the level that everyone automatically assumes you're feverishly busy. That this level of busy-faking tends to occur at the same time of life as a passion for golf is no coincidence. Some truly cunning employees have managed to convince their superiors that they're \"doing deals\" out on the course. Such a fantastic achievement deserves respect rather than envy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
