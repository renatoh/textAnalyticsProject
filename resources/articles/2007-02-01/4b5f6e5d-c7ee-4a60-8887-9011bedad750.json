Photograph: Gero Breloer/EPA Even now, 18 years after the fall of the Berlin wall and some eight years since the transfer of government from Bonn, this most un-German of cities is still uncertain about its identity as a capital. Despite its growing image as a cool metropolis of underground nightclubs and a growing artists' scene with new hubs of creativity springing up all the time, the view from within the city is often despondent. Berliners see the place as down-at-heel, and unable to compete with London, Paris or New York as a vibrant world city. Their city is not your typical west European capital, but one of smelly drains, bad service and dog muck, of makeshift nightclubs in railway stations, lofts and deserted warehouses, still mentally divided into east and west. It's also financially bankrupt. It seems it takes an influx of visitors from the outside world to change their minds. Last week, they streamed in on charter flights and private jets for the 10-day long Berlin film festival which closed at the weekend - and it's thanks to them that Berliners are learning to appreciate how much their standing has grown. Brangelina recently bought a penthouse flat in the trendy district of Mitte, reportedly because they wanted their children to grow up experiencing a bit of the grittiness of real life not found in LA. According to the newly-launched German version of Vanity Fair, it measures a staggering 600 sq metres and the lift goes directly up to the loft apartment. Brad Pitt reportedly worked together with a local architects' office, Graft, to convert it. Other \"outsiders\" are lapping up the city: was that Jennifer Lopez seen in the riverside warehouse nightclub Spindler and Klatt? And Robert De Niro, eating schnitzel in the elegant Borchardt restaurant? Norman Mailer, wandering incognito through the streets? And yes, Matt Damon enjoying, as he is unable to back home, a cigarette on the sidewalk? Writing in Der Tagesspiegel, Elisabeth Binder is excited by the New York Times' proclamation that \"Berlin is like New York City in the 1980s\", where \"rents are cheap, graffiti is everywhere and the air crackles with a creativity that comes only from a city in transition\". As Binder says: \"This isn't something you grasp when you live here permanently\". Along with the World Cup, the Berlinale has helped to up interest immensely, and the stars of the Berlinale - including, this year, Judi Dench, Lauren Bacall, Sharon Stone and Richard Gere - have contributed towards the image, or myth, of this new, inspiring, creative city. Glamour is not what lures them, rather the lack of it. It's fitting that the current location of the Berlinale, since its shift from the west of the city, is on the former no man's land, next to where the Berlin wall once ran. Most visitors don't realise this as they swan between cinemas and parties in the sea of futuristic buildings that have sprung up on the once desolate strip of land. Yet it is this tension between what it once was and what it is trying to become that gives the city its charm. Lose that and Berlin will lose its edge. It's a delicate balancing act between smelly drains and glitzy penthouses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
