Many publishers and aspiring novelists must look at the sales figures for How to Be Good (370,622 copies and counting) and wonder what it is that Hornby's got. It cannot just be the subject matter: relationship fumbling among educated yet demotic middle-class over-30s (and their children). It is surely whatever makes the telling of the story seem unmanufactured, inimitable - in Henry James's highest term of praise, \"sincere\". It is what all Hornby's books have in common, and what makes them identifiable: a certain narrative tone. Tone is the hardest thing to catch, yet what often matters most to readers. It is what makes you think that a Jane Austen sentence could not have been written by anyone else - as if, like stylistic DNA, the smallest element of a writer's prose carried within it the essence of his or her singularity. Successful bad writers can have this too, though only as some merely dogged, mechanical consistency of style. Finding a personal-sounding tone is much harder. When I was a student, and tough-minded literary theory had recently arrived, \"tone\" was banned, as bespeaking a woolly and impressionistic approach to textual analysis. It was particularly shunned as a metaphor taken from speech (suggesting a tone of voice). Jacques Derrida had decided that it was a terrible error to think of language as essentially spoken (personal, spontaneous) rather than always written (systematic, second-hand). Yet reviewers invariably speak of the \"tone\" of Hornby's narratives, and it is surely as good a word as any for his appeal. Here is something like a typical Hornby sentence (Katie is telling us about a row with her husband). \"It begins with something about a plastic bag with a hole in it (I didn't know it had a hole in it, and I told David to use it to... Oh, forget it); it ends with me telling David that he's a talentless and evil bastard, and with him telling me that he can't hear my voice without wanting to throw up.\" You may say that this is not great writing, but the banalities and exaggerations are the point. The intended effect is of a voice (Hornby's voice, to all intents and purposes) ruefully admitting to the ordinary, self-administered disasters of life. That parenthesis is very Hornby: his narrators often lead you part way down an absurd explanation before saying, as Katie does, \"I will spare you any further details.\" In his invaluable though now neglected book, Practical Criticism, IA Richards defined \"tone\" as \"the attitude of the speaker to what he is speaking about\". He was thinking of poetry, but the definition is still useful. \"Tone\" is entirely separate from story. In a first-person, semi-confessional narrative, tone is even separate from the actual content of the narrator's thoughts. Tone is, as it were, what Katie thinks about what she is thinking, what she says about what she is saying. Katie is always catching herself, correcting herself, not quite liking what she has just told us. She finds herself privately appalled by her daughter's \"charitable\" friendship with an obnoxious, \"deprived\" schoolmate. \"So. To recap: I wish to be forgiven for my trespasses... and yet I will not forgive those who trespass against me, even if they are eight-year-old girls whose only real trespass is smelling bad. And having grey skin. And not being terribly bright. Right. OK, then. Let me think about that, and I'll come back to you.\" The tone always has to be anti-solemn, even if melancholy is sometimes allowed. The trick is to sound bleak (because honest about human failures) while conveying some underlying sense of buoyancy (because people are decent really). Here is Katie contemplating her agreement to allow David's healer, GoodNews, to \"treat\" her too. \"Maybe that's what marriage is anyhow, the death of the personality, and GoodNews is irrelevant: I should have killed myself, as it were, years ago. As I walk up the stairs I feel like I am experiencing my own personal Jonestown.\" There is nothing suicidal in these sentiments, of course, just self-mocking hyperbole (one of Hornby's favoured tropes). The tone tells us that the narrator finds it as absurd as we do. And tone is what matters. \u00b7 John Mullan is senior lecturer in English at University College London \u00b7 Have your say about How to Be Good on the Guardian talkboards or write to The Review, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
