Designed as a pre-emptive strike on an imminent report from the Democratic majority, the GOP document underlines how evidence presented at the hearings failed to shatter Republicans\u2019 united front. It also provides a blueprint for House Republicans to defend the US president at Wednesday\u2019s judiciary committee hearing and for their Senate counterparts to acquit him in a trial. Democrats accuse Trump of attempting to bribe the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, by making a White House meeting and nearly $400m in military aid conditional on Ukraine announcing two investigations that would boost Trump politically. The 123-page Republican report was prepared for Devin Nunes, Jim Jordan and Michael McCaul, the ranking members on the House intelligence, oversight and foreign affairs committees, respectively. It directly contradicts the testimony of career diplomats and makes little attempt to get to grips with the devastating evidence of Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, who spoke about the existence of a quid pro quo, or Fiona Hill, former top Russia expert at the White House, who warned against falling for Moscow\u2019s propaganda about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election. Instead it spins the affair as a Democratic plot. Its executive summary begins with the premise that nearly 63 million Americans from around the country elected Trump in 2016 but now 231 House Democrats in Washington are \u201ctrying to undo the will of the American people\u201d. It accuses the party of seeking to impeach the president from day one. \u201cThey are trying to impeach President Trump because some unelected bureaucrats chafed at an elected President\u2019s \u2018outside the beltway\u2019 approach to diplomacy,\u201d it says. The evidence does not prove Democrats\u2019 allegations about Trump leveraging a White House meeting and military aid for political self-interest, it states, nor that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and a \u201cshadow\u201d group of US officials conspired to benefit the president politically. (Hill testified that John Bolton, then Trump\u2019s national security adviser, described Giuliani as a \u201chand grenade that was going to blow everyone up\u201d.) \u201cNone of the Democrats\u2019 witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor,\u201d it argues, echoing a Republican talking point during the hearings that said the evidence against Trump is based on hearsay. \u201cAt the heart of the matter, the impeachment inquiry involves the actions of only two people: President Trump and President Zelensky. The summary of their July 25, 2019, telephone conversation shows no quid pro quo or indication of conditionality, threats, or pressure \u2013 much less evidence of bribery or extortion. \u201cThe summary reflects laughter, pleasantries, and cordiality. President Zelensky has said publicly and repeatedly that he felt no pressure. President Trump has said publicly and repeatedly that he exerted no pressure.\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the intelligence committee, dismissed the minority report as \u201cintended for an audience of one\u201d and ignoring \u201cvoluminous evidence that the president used the power of his office to pressure Ukraine\u201d. \u201cTellingly, the Minority dismisses this as just part of the President\u2019s \u2018outside the beltway\u2019 thinking. It is more accurately, outside the law and constitution, and a violation of his oath of office,\u201d he added. Appearing on the Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC network later on Monday night, Schiff offered more details about the timeline for the committee\u2019s report. \u201cWe\u2019re putting the finishing touches on the report, which will be released publicly tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow night we\u2019ll also have a vote to formally transmit the committee report to judiciary. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a long document. Members started reading it today. They\u2019ll be reading it throughout the day tomorrow and essentially it outlines in considerable detail a scheme that began, actually, well before the recall of Ambassador [Marie] Yovanovitch and was designed to further two political objectives of the president, which is an investigation into Joe Biden and an investigation into this debunked conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine that interfered in the last election, not Russia.\u201d Trump has persistently told Democrats and other critics to read the call transcript. But they have pointed to 10 words, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though\u201d, as clear proof he expected a quid pro quo in the context of congressionally approved military funding being frozen. It was later released. The report adds: \u201cEven examining evidence beyond the presidential phone call shows no quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, or abuse of power. The evidence shows that President Trump holds a deepseated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine due to its history of pervasive corruption.\u201d Trump has also been vocal about his doubts over US foreign aid and the need for European allies to shoulder more of the financial burden for regional defence, it goes on. \u201cUnderstood in this proper context, the President\u2019s initial hesitation to meet with President Zelensky or to provide US taxpayer-funded security assistance to Ukraine without thoughtful review is entirely prudent.\u201d All members of the House intelligence committee can review a draft of Democrats\u2019 report in classified spaces on Monday night. It will be adopted at meeting behind closed doors on Tuesday evening, then sent to the judiciary committee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
