But until now none had achieved the feat across fiction and non-fiction. The honours go to Conn Iggulden, whose Genghis Khan novel Wolf of the Plains has followed its predecessors by hitting number one. Simultaneously, The Dangerous Book for Boys, which he co-wrote with his brother Hal, edged out Peter Kay by just 48 copies to take the non-fiction top slot. All that remains is for him to pen a bestselling children's book. \u00b7 The biggest thrillers of all time - The Day of the Jackal and The Da Vinci Code - built their conspiracy plots around real historical events. So it was inevitable that the death of Princess Diana would get the same treatment. In July, the month before the 10th anniversary of the Paris crash, Transworld will publish The Accident Man by Tom Cain (the pseudonym of a \"well-known investigative journalist\"). The book stars an assassin who ordinarily targets \"bad people\", but who realises, after engineering a car accident, that he has been set up to murder the royal. The branch of Waterstone's at Harrods - the store owned by Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed Al Fayed - has not yet decided whether to stock the book. \u00b7 As publishers concentrate their marketing budgets on fewer and fewer books, they are able to afford television campaigns. In February, Penguin will sponsor an entire weekend on digital channel Paramount to promote Marian Keyes's paperback Anybody Out There. The weekend, called \"The Funny Side of Love\", will feature programmes such as Ally McBeal and Sex and the City - each introduced by Keyes. \u00b7 Woolworths has always been a bookseller - it was one of the first outlets for Penguin's mould-breaking paperbacks. But the company has suddenly become the dominant force in British book distribution. This week, via its Entertainment UK division (EUK), it bought the renowned wholesaler and library supplier Bertrams. Founded by Elsie Bertram from her garden shed in the 1960s, Bertrams revolutionised the supply chain, enabling booksellers to order an unmatchable range of titles for next-day delivery. The Norwich-based business has been through rocky patches, but this \u00a329m deal sees it join former rival THE to form a group supplying Tesco, Sainsbury's and numerous websites - as well as thousands of independents. Publishers will be concerned: although such consolidation was inevitable, this will pile yet more pressure on trading terms. \u00b7 Despite the trend for new-look classics lists, no publisher has dared to meddle with the texts - until now. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson is to launch a list of edited literary classics, called Compact Editions. It claims that market research shows many readers are put off by the \"elitist\" image of classics and by their daunting length and small print. So the Compact Editions - slogan \"Great Books in Half the Time\" - have been \"sympathetically edited\" down to fewer than 400 pages each. Weidenfeld insists that the novels retain the core plot, characters and historical background. The first six titles - Anna Karenina, Vanity Fair, David Copperfield, The Mill on the Floss, Moby-Dick and Wives and Daughters - are to be released in May and will doubtless be snapped up by students eager to cut down their reading time. \u00b7 \"Parental involvement in reading has more of an influence on children's achievements than any other factor - including how well-educated or rich their parents are.\" So says Julia Strong, director of the new Family Reading Campaign, which launched this week. Research shows that 20 per cent of children feel their mums don't encourage them to read, while one in three receives no encouragement from their dad. The campaign wants all families to put reading, particularly reading for pleasure, at the heart of their daily lives and the culture of their home. It brings together organisations from the education, library and parenting sectors to hammer the message home.
