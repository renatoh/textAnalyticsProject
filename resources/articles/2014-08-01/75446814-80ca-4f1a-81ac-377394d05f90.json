I have become very adept at typing while working on matters to do with our dispute up here in Doncaster. Perhaps it could empower me to find an alternative career and become an author? How about the memoirs of my time in the caring profession, Confessions of a Support Worker maybe. One for the top shelf? Early start today, domestic duties carried out. In a previous life, of an Upstairs, Downstairs sort, I would undoubtedly have been Downstairs. Wife and son, still in the horizontal mode, candidates for Upstairs. My nearly 18-year-old has probably spent the majority of the night flicking his eyes from one screen to another, from iPad to iPhone to PC. His eyes are generally like catherine wheels when he surfaces. I keep telling him to enjoy it while it lasts, because when the dramatic drop in wages kick in thanks to the inappropriately named company I work for, some of the screens may well have to disappear. The response tends to be a shrug of the shoulders. I don't think the significance of what's going on has registered in a testosterone-fuelled young mind. Could Churchill help? I spoke to a former colleague yesterday who, after 35 years in the job, said goodbye to the people she has cared for all her life, people with learning disabilities. She simply cannot carry on working for a company whose philosophy is all about profit. A few tears were shed as we have grown up alongside each other, part of our extended family. Still, there's always a glass of wine and Max Hastings's book on Churchill's \"finest years\". Maybe I could use some of his speeches as a rallying point for my fellow strikers? More tempting still is to lock myself in the conservatory for a session of listening to the mighty Led Zeppelin, an integral part of my daily life for more than 40 years. Let us all fight together I go on a shopping trip with the better half. As the traffic becomes stationary, I recognise a familiar face walking along Balby Road. I wind the window down and shout: \"Ey up, big lad, how you doing?\" It's Andy, a gent I used to care for. \"Hello, Rog,\" comes the response. \"When you coming back to the flats; we miss you?\" \"I don't know, mate. Maybe one day. \"You still going down to watch the Rovers?\" \"Yep, I'm still going.\" As we pull away, my wife asks if I'm OK. All right, I say, as the tears roll down my cheeks. This company cannot take away my memories of my career and I have no regrets. We fight on. And for the future generations. For my son. If we allow the Gordon Gekkos of the private equities to have their way, he has no future. Zero-hours contracts, minimum wage, creating a transient workforce. Time for a Churchillian call to arms: \"We shall never surrender\u2026\" I knew reading that book would come in handy. I switch my phone back on after a few hours' break. Inundated, like my colleagues, with messages of solidarity and support (please keep the donations coming, folks). Our fight is your fight. A recent survey concluded that our National Health Service is the best in the world and that the worst is America's. Unless we make a stand now for our national treasure, we will undoubtedly inherit the latter. To the millionaires sat round the cabinet table this has no significance; they all have private care. I have to admit that I Googled myself recently. \"Anti-capitalist\" came the result. Why? For asking for a fair living wage? If that's the case, I am proud to be deemed as one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
