Actually that was last year. In terms of album sales across Europe, it seems the British are already here. UK acts have dominated the European album charts in 2006, collecting19 of the 36 Platinum Awards so far handed to records with sales of more than one million copies, according to new figures. Homegrown artists make up four out of the top five biggest sellers this year, with only Confessions on a Dancefloor by Madonna, who at her current rate of progress will be more British than the Queen by 2010, foiling a clean sweep. Robbie Williams predictably dominates the upper regions, with albums in first and third positions and another, his latest Rudebox, looking set to join them with sales of two million in its first week. James Blunt and Coldplay are the other British acts in the top five, in second and fourth place respectively. The US is the country with the next largest number of Platinum acts. It has 12 on the list. But one of those, Scissor Sisters, were signed in the UK. The British Phonographic Institute (BPI) said the results underlined British music's increasing profile on the international stage. Chairman Peter Jamieson said: \"These latest figures confirm that we are going through a golden age for new British music, even by our own high standards.\" Six of the 19 UK Platinum Award winners are 2006 releases and Britain's haul is likely to rise even further when records by Arctic Monkeys, Snow Patrol, Corinne Bailey Rae, Keane and Razorlight are taken into account. The Kooks, Sugababes and Katie Melua are amongst other UK artists who have already made it to the one million mark this year. Quite apart from Britain's success, the overwhelming success of English language acts in Europe is worth remarking on. Of the remaining five non-UK, non-US albums to hit one million sales, two are from a Colombian, Shakira, who sings in English. Two more are French, and one is Italian. A BPI spokesman said: \"There is a degree of truth in the argument that American and British acts do well because English is the second language across most of Europe. But that doesn't explain why we are doing better than the US. Sales of British music have grown 15% over the past five or six years despite the fact that the industry as a whole is going through a tough patch. That solid period of success has given us the opportunity to invest in new bands, which means your Keanes and Razorlights are more likely to get their break.\" There is some good news for those who rail against the seemingly unstoppable march of the English language across Europe. Holding out as a last cultural bastion against overwhelming Anglo-American domination is the young French singer Raphael, whose Caravane album has drawn comparisons with Neil Young and Bob Dylan. However the remaining two names on the list will not make such pleasant reading for our continental cousins. International bright young things they really are not. Johnny Halliday and Zucchero anyone?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
