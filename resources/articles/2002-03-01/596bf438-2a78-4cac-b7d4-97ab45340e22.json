Resuming on 131 for one and needing another 200 to win the Test, the series and the minds of their last remaining doubters, Steve Waugh's men blasted a cavalier path to a four-wicket triumph that confirms their position as the world's best Test team. Ricky Ponting brought up a fine undefeated century by smashing a six for the winning runs, but it was fitting that Shane Warne was at the crease with him. The leg-spinner, playing in his 100th Test, was named man of the match for his 63 in the first innings and his marathon haul of six for 161 from 70 overs during South Africa's second innings. It was a victory that was hard earned by the Australians and was rated by Warne as the best of his illustrious career. \"I think this is probably my favourite-ever Test match,\" he said. \"The good thing about the Australian cricket team is that this is a team sport, and something an individual sport doesn't give you is team achievement. It couldn't have worked out any better. To be there and get a few runs at the end was just a wonderful feeling. \"I'm very satisfied but I'm absolutely knackered too, so hopefully I'll be able to spend a little time on the beach before the next Test in Durban.\" That game, the last of the series, begins on Friday. Australia suffered a mini scare when, having advanced to 251 for two, they lost four wickets for 54 runs. But Adam Gilchrist rapiered 24 from as many balls to put the chase back on track and Warne was nerveless at the death, finishing unbeaten with 15. Ponting ensured a stylish finale when, 94 not out and with three runs to win, the Tasmanian completed his 10th and most mature century with a pull off Paul Adams over the square-leg fence which sent him into a delirious sprint towards the pavilion. Matthew Hayden will retain slightly less ecstatic memories of the Test. Four runs short of becoming the only man behind Sir Donald Bradman to score centuries in five successive Tests, the hulking left-hander lost patience with Jacques Kallis bowling two feet outside the off stump and lurched at a near wide only to snick a catch to the wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. With Hayden departed, Australia lost both Mark and Steve Waugh in quick succession - the umpire Rudi Koertzen mistook Mark's bat hitting his boot for an edge, and Steve was bowled for the second time in the match by a chinaman from Adams - before Damien Martyn was dismissed for a duck, sending the crowd into an optimistic frenzy. But Gilchrist soon silenced them. South Africa's selectors reacted to the defeat by recalling the out-of-favour all-rounder Lance Klusener for the third Test. Shaun Pollock has not recovered from his side strain and yet another seamer, David Terbrugge, will play, three years after his last international appearance. \u00b7 The gold bar on offer at the first Test between South Africa and Australia to any batsman hitting a billboard target with a six will again be up for grabs during all seven matches of their forthcoming one-day series."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
