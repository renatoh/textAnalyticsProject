The move - the most dramatic change in newspaper editorship of recent years - will make Wade the Sun's first female editor. The News International chairman, Les Hinton, made the announcement in an email to staff at lunchtime today. \"David Yelland announced today that he was resigning as editor of the Sun. He is to take up a role in the management of the company and will be entering business school in the United States,\" he said. \"Rebekah Wade, editor of the News of the World, becomes editor of the Sun, effective Tuesday, January 14.\" Mr Hinton added that a full statement would be issued later today. When Yelland was appointed editor of the Sun in mid-1998, many thought he had been brought in by proprietor Rupert Murdoch to make the paper more heavyweight. He first came to Mr Murdoch's attention while he was the business editor of the Sun and progressed to become the deputy editor of the New York Post and one of the media mogul's speechwriters. One of his first front pages showed a picture of Tony Blair accompanied by the Eurosceptic slogan: \"Is this the most dangerous man in Britain?\". However, under Yelland's editorship the Sun has also urged its readers to vote Labour. Throughout his time in office, Yelland has been engaged in a war of words with Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan. The feud became increasingly bitter over the past year as the two tabloids engaged in a price war. When the Mirror dropped its cover price by 12p to 20p last spring, the Sun quickly followed suit and slashed its own price, dropping even further to 10p in London. Sales of the Sun have stabilised at about 3.5 million copies - with a slight dip in December 2002 - while sales of the Mirror have continued to decline. Last week Wade and Yelland returned from holidays in Barbados. Wags claimed it was significant that both were on the same plane out but only Wade travelled first class. Wade, also showed first class networking skills, by sejourning on Lachlan Murdoch's yacht."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
