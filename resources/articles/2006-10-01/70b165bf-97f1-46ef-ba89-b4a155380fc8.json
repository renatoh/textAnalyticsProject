We've seen Stupid Dublin, Stag-Party Dublin, Success-Story Dublin; and now, in drama (Conor McPherson's Rum and Vodka), in reportage (Paul Reynolds's King Scum) and in film (Lenny Abrahamson's truly wonderful Adam and Paul), we're seeing Scuzzy Dublin, Screwed-up Dublin, Sinking Dublin. Novelists, too, have touched on this, but none more so than Mia Gallagher in her debut breezeblock of a novel, which takes screwed-up and scuzzy into hitherto uncharted territory. Hellfire is the unrelieved internal monologue of \"a mass a blood and bones and cravin called Lucy Dolan\", fresh out of prison. It is addressed to a man called Nayler with whom she anticipates some kind of reckoning. She is a recovering junkie, given to visions (an inheritance from her tarot-reading grandmother), and the issue of a home not so much broken as smithereened. Her reminiscences take in her progression, before the age of 15, through pickpocketing, homosexuality, the gamut of drug use from tobacco to smack, gangsterism, arson and the witnessing of horrific violence. Her downward spiral begins when she's still in the womb, and is black and steep and extreme. Nayler introduces her to heroin and makes her pay for her fix by watching him have sex with her mother. She is periodically sectioned until one psychotic episode, during which she kills a man in an airport lounge, puts her in prison; we join her on the first day of her release, as she waits in the ruined house on top of a mountain where her younger and less tarnished sister was, some years ago, tortured and killed (this sister was often used as a human ashtray by her mother). This is a web of cruelty so contrived as almost to rival Thomas Harris's Hannibal for ludicrousness, except for one crucial difference - Hellfire is believable. This stuff happens. And Gallagher depicts a culture in despair and a society in irreversible meltdown with tremendous compassion and energy. Many will balk at the relentlessness of this large book, but that should not diminish its vitality and importance. Fate - or, more specifically, predestination bound up with sociopolitical prejudice - is central to the novel. Sterne-like, we see Lucy in the womb and witness her emergence into a world drenched in violence, from the domestic (wife-beating) to the political (pub-bombings), and over which priests loom like commandants. It is a world of supernatural noise and influence represented by the church and tarot, in which any sense of rootedness soon crumbles away and one is forced to recognise that one's identity is contingent on the partiality of those with power. Nayler's take on this is that \"shit happens\", but Lucy acknowledges the entrenchedness of the desolation: \"there's harsher ways a killin people than breakin their necks ... Ya can leach the spirit outta them by strippin them of hope and beauty, by stickin them in a barracks a grey concrete, by leadin them ta expect nothin from their lives only failure. Who would say a life lived in failure, in yearnin and wantin and hatin and fearin and cryin and seekin, is any kinder than death?\" Such authenticity needs redeeming, especially in such a long novel, and this is partially achieved through Gallagher's narrative skill, the cohesive networks of sign and motif that run throughout, and are impressively sustained. The symbolic scene in which Lucy and Charlie are stuck in the basement of a townhouse-turned-drug-den, \"in the scullery - somewhere the gentry never visited\", is remarkably done; as, at times, is the unexpectedly weighted power and beauty of the imagery: \"The trackmarks inside her arms are blue and red, like the Union Jack blew up right beside her and scattered her with its dust.\" It's always pleasing, too, to see standard English take a battering, although the dialectical rendering here is necessarily light. But the vernacular rhythm is perfect, as is the illustration of the accumulative nature of idiolect with phrases pilfered from commercials and songs seaming the speech. This solidity is threatened but never overrun by the vagueness consequent to a vast cast, and also the lack of physical description of almost anything but people; this could, of course, be a deliberate attempt to add another facet to the depiction of junkie self-absorption, but it does, in such a long novel, become wearying. Yet the gamble Gallagher takes - to insist on the redemptive power of story through one restricted voice and over so many pages - pays off. That's an extraordinary ambition. A grand achievement, too. \u00b7 Niall Griffiths's most recent novel is Wreckage (Vintage)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
