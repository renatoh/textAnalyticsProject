According to Artnet, the Cinema for Peace fundraiser took place at the Berlin Konzerthaus, whose pillars the artist decorated \u2013 as part of his installation Safe Passage \u2013 with 14,000 lifejackets flown in from Lesbos, Greece, where almost 450,000 refugees arrived in 2015 on their way into the EU. Fundraiser guests, including actor Charlize Theron and Pussy Riot member Nadya Tolokonnikova, were encouraged to don emergency thermal blankets similar to those given to refugees. In a Facebook post, Tim Renner, Berlin\u2019s culture secretary, was highly critical of the sight of dinner guests at a star-studded gala posing in the blankets at the party. \u201cWhen Ai Weiwei illustrates the dimensions of terror outside [the gala] with 14,000 life jackets from Lesbos, it is perhaps not subtle but effective and justified; but when the guests of Cinema for Peace are prompted by the organiser to don emergency blankets for a group photo, even if understood as an act of solidarity, it has a clearly obscene element,\u201d he said. Ai Weiwei, whose recent work has focused on the migration crisis, was criticised two weeks ago for recreating a photo of the drowned Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi \u2013 for the magazine India Today \u2013 in which the artist lies face down on a beach. He maintained that his work was intended to \u201cdefend the dignity\u201d of the refugees."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
