The Dutch striker unexpectedly emerged as Thierry Henry's main partner for much of this season and scored four times in 27 Premiership appearances. He told the club's website: \"I am so pleased that I will be at Arsenal for another year. Next season will be my 10th with the club, and that just shows what Arsenal means to me. \"We have a great squad and team spirit at the club which we have proved by winning the Premiership this year. I hope I will be part of another successful campaign for Arsenal next season.\" Bergkamp is believed to have accepted a cut of 40% on his \u00a31m a year salary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
