His almost 3,000 songs, 30 Broadway shows and 17 Hollywood musicals amounted to a unique testament to a talent for creating tunes and lyrics that millions of people in several generations could identify with. Jerome Kern, asked about Berlin's place in American music, replied \"Irving Berlin is American music\" and Cole Porter put him in one of his own songs in Anything Goes: \"You're the top, you're a Waldorf salad; You're the top, you're a Berlin ballad.\" \"I've not done badly,\" he decided towards the end of his life \"for a poor immigrant boy who can't read music.\" He did his composing on a one-key piano (F sharp) with a lever under the keyboard to manipulate a fuller range. Asked what effect a more sophisticated musical education would have had on his talent, Berlin replied \"Ruin it.\" Born in Siberia, his real name was Israel Baline. After trouble with local Cossacks his father Moses emigrated with other Russian Jews to America, taking his wife and eight children. Little Izzy was only four when they settled in New York's Lower East Side in three crowded rooms with no windows. He sang in a local synagogue with his father. His father died when he was eight, and at once he gave up school and went on the streets selling newspapers and singing the songs he picked up outside the bars and restaurants. His first really original song, Alexander's Ragtime Band, was hard to sell, then hit followed hit - Everybody's Doin' It, Ragtime Violin, and so on. In 1939, with the world on the brink of another war, he paid his tribute of schmaltz to his adopted country with God Bless America and refused to accept any royalties. He wrote White Christmas for a Bing Crosby film and it became the Yuletide runner-up to Silent Night. Not that composition came to him easily. Walter Scharf once said that seeing Berlin working on White Christmas was like watching a woman in labour. At 53, he decided to do another wartime musical, 25 years after his first one. He found soldiers this time were more grim and serious and cynical about blatant flag-waving. This Is The Army responded and became a hit both in the US and overseas. After the war, his biggest successes were the musicals Annie Get Your Gun, and Call Me Madam - his flow of tunes seemed as spontaneous in his sixties as in his twenties. He summed up his lifetime of songs this way: \"White Christmas made the most money but God Bless America is the closest to me emotionally.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
