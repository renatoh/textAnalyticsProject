As Downing Street pledged to press ahead with its counter-terrorism bill, the rebels said they hoped to defeat the government after signing up MPs who voted in favour of Tony Blair's unsuccessful bid to extend to 90 days the period terror suspects could be detained without charge. David Winnick, one of the main rebels, said: \"I believe there is a reasonable chance that the government will be defeated, but I do accept that the government will do everything in its power to try to persuade some of my colleagues to agree on the basis of various concessions.\" The rebel amendment was tabled as Downing Street made clear that Gordon Brown was determined to press ahead with his plans. The prime minister's spokesman said: \"It is the prime minister's view and the home secretary's view that there can be no question of any compromise over 42 days. They are both strongly of the view that it is necessary to put in place legislation on a precautionary basis to enable terror suspects to be held for more than the current 28-day limit.\" Brown and Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, were said to be \"displeased\" by a report in yesterday's Guardian which said that the prime minister had sanctioned a last-ditch move to secure a deal to avoid a government defeat when MPs vote next month. There was no complaint with the substance of the article, which reported that the compromise would not be over 42 days but over the parliamentary and judicial oversight that would be established. Downing Street was irritated that some Labour figures were happy for reports to appear which showed the prime minister was prepared to back down. Brown is keen to avoid the impression that he is weakened after he made a U-turn this week to compensate most of the people hit by the abolition of the 10p tax rate. But the prime minister's spokesman indicated that the prime minister was prepared to reach out to rebels on the judicial and parliamentary oversight element of the bill. \"Of course there is a detailed discussion on exactly what precise parliamentary and judicial safeguards are in place in order to enable that,\" he said. There is a debate within government over the 42 days. Jack Straw, the justice secretary, is making little secret of his unease about the change which may, he fears, exacerbate the government's relations with British Muslims. Straw, who has a high proportion of Muslims in his Blackburn constituency, is supported by other figures, such as Sadiq Khan, the government whip and MP for Tooting, who is one of only two Muslim members of the government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
