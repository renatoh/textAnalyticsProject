The Springboks were undone by the potent cocktail of Irish passion and cussedness, the precision boot of Jonny Sexton and rain \u2013 just the kind of slippery conditions they are likely to encounter when they meet Scotland at St James\u2019 Park, Newcastle, or Samoa in Birmingham next autumn. \u201cWe just made too many mistakes\u2026no excuses there,\u201d said the coach, Heyneke Meyer, for whom Saturday was his first defeat in the northern hemisphere as Springboks coach. Everything seemed to be going well, especially after recently beating New Zealand, the best side in the world. South Africa had even found a young fly-half capable of adding flair to the traditional Bok strength of a physical pack. However, Handr\u00e9 Pollard, 20, the architect of victory over the All Blacks, as well as scorer of two tries, came a poor second to Sexton, who spent the match proving to his paymasters what a good deal they had done in buying him back from France. From the opening moments when the fly-half\u2019s first kick landed on Bryan Habana and a second caused the full-back Willie le Roux the first of his many problems, South Africa alarm bells were ringing and Pollard got something of a reproach from his coach for not handling the conditions. \u201cYou can\u2019t play Championship rugby [the Rugby Championship] away from home. You have to adapt to conditions and we didn\u2019t do that,\u201d said Meyer, who had seen Pollard turn down three kicks at goal in the hope of something better and generally be over ambitious with his game management. \u201cWe have never played well this year in wet conditions. You have to go back to basics, be more astute tactically. We will learn from this and at the end of these four games we\u2019ll know where we stand, which guys can cope and which guys can\u2019t,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cWe have to get balance in our side. It\u2019s great to score tries but, if the game doesn\u2019t open up, it\u2019s usually an arm wrestle. You have to look after the ball. \u201cCall it a lack of concentration, call it a lack of coaching, call it whatever you want but we have to catch better. The strange thing is the three training sessions we had before the match were probably the best I\u2019ve had since becoming the Bok coach.\u201d What happens in training this week during preparations for the England Test was a subject tackled by Meyer\u2019s captain Jean de Villiers, presumably the guy who could have overruled Pollard\u2019s ambition in favour of something more conservative and more Bok. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it on the chin, we\u2019ll be hard on each other for a couple of days,\u201d De Villiers said, \u201cthen we\u2019ll start focusing on the next game.\u201d If Sir Ian McGeechan, the former Lions coach, is right in saying a wounded Springbok is the most dangerous Springbok, then England will have to look out although Saturday\u2019s weather forecast for Twickenham suggests more showers. Either way, Meyer is convinced 11 months out is too soon to start worrying about the World Cup. \u201cYou don\u2019t look that far ahead,\u201d said the former Leicester coach. \u201cYou learn game from game and this is a really important tour for us because it will show what\u2019s lacking in the game plan. Seven games is a lot of rugby before the World Cup starts but it\u2019s important for me that we know exactly where we stand after this tour.\u201d Ireland\u2019s coach, Joe Schmidt, meanwhile enhanced his reputation by introducing a new centre partnership who seemed to understand more about wet-weather rugby than anyone facing them. Robbie Henshaw, playing his second Test in the No12 shirt, alongside Jared Payne, a New Zealander making his debut for his adoptive country, may not be together next week even if Payne\u2019s foot mends in time for the Munster man to face Georgia. However he had a decent audition for the No13 shirt Brian O\u2019Driscoll wore 133 times.
