The ten minute rule bill - which stands no chance of becoming law - aims to overturn legislation from the past three centuries which now discriminates against anti-monarchists and Catholics. Kevin McNamara, the Labour MP sponsoring the bill, described it as a \"modest measure\" which would demonstrate the will of the house to modernise its constitution. The treason, felony, act of settlement and parliamentary oath bill would see Britain's unwritten constitution brought into line with the European convention on human rights by allowing: \u00b7 MPs to affirm an oath of responsibility to constituents, rather than the monarch, amending the 1978 Oath Act \u00b7 Subjects to express a view to peacefully abolish the monarchy without being subject to a life imprisonment under the 1848 Treason and Felony Act \u00b7 Allow Catholics to inherit the throne, amending the Act of Settlement, 1701 Mr McNamara said the move to amend the oath - which has prevented Sinn Fein MPs attending the Commons chamber - would \"return to solemnity\" an act which has recently become \"an indignity and an absurdity\" because of Labour critics of the monarchy murmuring or muttering the oath. The bill was agreed by 170 votes to 32, and will now receive its second reading in January. It was opposed only by the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, the Reverend Ian Paisley, who condemned it as \"an attempt to undermine the constitution.\" Last year, the Guardian unsuccessfully appealed to both the attorney general and the high court, in an attempt to guarantee the editor, Alan Rusbridger, would not go to prison for publishing articles advocating a republic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
