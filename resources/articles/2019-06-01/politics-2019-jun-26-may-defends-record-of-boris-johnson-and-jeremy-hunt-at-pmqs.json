In a fierce exchange at prime minister\u2019s questions with the Scottish National party\u2019s Ian Blackford, May said: \u201cEither of the candidates for this high office would do a darn sight better job than anybody sitting on those benches,\u201d pointing to Labour and the SNP. Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, challenged the prime minister to say whether she would decline to vote for a successor willing to take the UK into a no-deal Brexit. \u201cDo or die, come what may. Those are the words of the prime minister\u2019s likely successor,\u201d Blackford said, referring to Johnson\u2019s Talkradio interview on Tuesday. \u201cThe Tory dream is to drag us out of the EU, no matter the cost.\u201d Blackford said the prime minister was showing \u201cgross cowardice\u201d by not condemning her successor\u2019s willingness to enact no deal. \u201cYou are asking people to put their faith in the most incompetent foreign secretary in a century, a man who has made a career out of lying, who has spent his week avoiding the media and staging photos and playing to the extreme delusions of the Tory shires,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, we also have the most incompetent health secretary in our history, a man who writes books on privatising our NHS.\u201d In an earlier exchange with Jeremy Corbyn, May defended the UK government as the Labour leader challenged her over arms sales toSaudi Arabia. His comments came after British weapons exports to the Gulf kingdom were ruled unlawful by the court of appeal in a judgment that also accused ministers of ignoring whether airstrikes that killed civilians in Yemen had broken humanitarian law. \u201cThe UN describes the situation in Yemen as \u2018humanity\u2019s biggest preventable disaster\u2019, and the government sees fit to continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia during that situation,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cCan I ask the prime minister a very simple question: does she believe there are serious ongoing violations of international humanitarian law by Saudi Arabia in Yemen \u2013 yes or no?\u201d May insisted the government did \u201cconsider these issues very carefully when we are considering arms export licences\u201d and said a political solution was needed in Yemen. However, she defended the Saudi-led intervention, which she said was \u201cin response to a request from the legitimate government in Yemen, following a rebel insurgency which overthrew the internationally recognised government\u201d. May also criticised the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who was forced to withdraw an invitation he had issued to Ahmed Alshami, a leading member of the Houthi coalition, at a Stop the War Coalition meeting on Tuesday. The Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, a former international development secretary, also criticised the British response, calling the situation \u201ca catastrophe\u201d. \u201cIsn\u2019t the case that Britain should move to a position of far greater neutrality supporting a comprehensive ceasefire?\u201d he said. \u201cWhile Britain is absolutely right to condemn the Houthi attacks on Riyadh and Jeddah, can we not also condemn the night after night bombings by the Saudi aircraft which are killing innocent civilians and radicalising tens of thousands of Yemenis?\u201d May said the government had supported efforts for a ceasefire, reiterating that a political settlement was \u201cthe only way to get the security and stability in Yemen\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
