Speaking after her campaign launch on Tuesday morning, the former leader of the House of Commons suggested it would not be right for her to issue a blanket ban on any future referendum, even though she was against it. \u201cThe reason I say \u2018never say never\u2019 is because I do not think that there should be another independence referendum in Scotland, I do not think it\u2019s in their interest, but on the other hand, I am a big believer in devolution,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what I just want to say is I am not going to stand here and utterly rule it out because I think that that is disrespectful. But I would very strongly fight against a second referendum, which I don\u2019t think is in the interest of Scotland and it\u2019s definitely not in the interests of the UK.\u201d Leadsom said she believed another referendum could be avoided by working to strengthen the union. \u201cWhat I think we have to be doing is promote the strength of the UK working together far stronger, far more than we have done, and I have a number of policy areas that I would use to try and make that happen,\u201d she said. Most Tory leadership candidates have so far ruled out any prospect of a second independence referendum. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, and the international development secretary, Rory Stewart, have all suggested they would not grant the Scottish parliament the powers to run another legally binding vote. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has published draft legislation on how a fresh referendum should be run in the second half of 2020. Javid said he would not allow a second independence referendum and Sturgeon should spend time improving public services rather than calling for a fresh vote. Hancock said his message would be \u201cNo way, Nicola\u201d to the idea of a fresh independence referendum. Hancock, who has the backing of several Scottish Conservative MPs, said: \u201cI\u2019m against second referendums because we live in a democracy and we follow the results of the first. When people are given a vote, politicians should listen. \u201cThe SNP government would do better to focus on the powers that it does have that it isn\u2019t using well enough. We all said before the Scottish referendum that this would settle the issue for a generation, and it has.\u201d Stewart said a fresh referendum on either Brexit or Scottish independence would only divide the country further, and has proposed a \u201cminister for the union\u201d in order to strengthen the UK. \u201cIn everything we do and everything we say in this leadership race, we should remember that the key is to unify the country and not divide the United Kingdom,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
