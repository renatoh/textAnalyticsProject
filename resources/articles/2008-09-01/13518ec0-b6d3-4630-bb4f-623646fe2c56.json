Last year, the commission invited 2,300 barristers to join a panel giving them access to the longest criminal trials but at reduced rates. So far only about 100 barristers and three QCs have signed up. The Criminal Bar Association has described the capped fees as \"derisory\". Under the new scheme, a QC's fees for trial preparation work range from \u00a391 to \u00a3145 an hour. For a leading junior, the rate is \u00a379 to \u00a3127 an hour. The lawyers who sign the panel's contracts represent defendants in cases where, for instance, the trial is likely to last more than 40 days, or where it lasts 25 days but involves a combination of factors such as terrorism, serious fraud or more than 10,000 pages of prosecution or third-party evidence. The dispute between the Bar and the commission reflects concern about payments to lawyers under the legal aid system - which is run by the Legal Services Commission and overseen by the Ministry of Justice - and the perception that some criminal barristers have become fat cats. Peter Lodder QC, a senior criminal barrister and chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, disputed this view, saying: \"There are people who have made a significant amount of money out of the system in the past, but there are very few of them and they have attracted a wholly disproportionate amount of media attention. Setting pay at these rates is thoroughly detrimental.\" He said that the full impact of the Bar's boycott had not yet been felt but that the first serious trials requiring QCs were due to reach court in the new year. The scheme suffered its most serious setback last week when James Benson, the solicitor representing one of the defendants in the Rhys Jones murder trial, was told he would be paid despite not being on the panel, after he started legal action against the commission. David Keegan, the director of high cost case contracting at the commission, said that although the exception made in the Rhys Jones case had not made the scheme redundant, he recognised that it \"definitely weakened it\". He acknowledged that there would be difficulties with forthcoming large trials, given that only three QCs had signed up to the scheme. \"We may have to acknowledge other exceptions in future,\" he said. Among the trials that could be affected by the Bar's boycott is a complex drugs trial at Woolwich crown court in April 2009 which will involve 24 defendants, all of whom were granted certificates by a judge for representation by a QC. According to Lodder, failure to secure QCs to represent these defendants could stall the trial and force the release of the defendants on bail, due to the limits placed on custody time for those awaiting trial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
