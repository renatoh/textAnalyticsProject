The 32-year-old British driver, who finished fourth in Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, said: \"This car hasn't suited me as well as McLaren's last two. Since I've been here this has been the worst year. It's been tricky, even on good weekends. We've had a problem pretty much every weekend, lately. We need to stop it. I don't get it.\" Button has been just as frustrated as his departing team-mate Lewis Hamilton as McLaren have failed to match the performances of Red Bull \u2013 or even Ferrari, who now look likely to relegate the British team to third place in the constructors' championship. Red Bull are certain to nail the team title, probably in Texas on Sunday week, while the drivers' crown is a two-way fight between Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso of Ferrari. Last year Button was the world championship runner-up, with 270 points; in 2010, his first year with the team, he finished fifth with 214 points; this year he is sixth with 153 points \u2013 102 behind Vettel \u2013 and in the unlikely event of him winning the last two races he will finish with only 203 points. Button denied that there were issues with his DRS or Kers systems in Sunday's race. \"The weekend was weird. Friday was good, Saturday morning was good but qualifying and the race wasn't amazing. It wasn't horrendous but it wasn't amazing. We've got to try a few new things with the set up. I'm not happy with where it is at the moment. But hopefully next year will be perfect. \"Next year is exciting but we've still got two races where we want to do well in. We still want to get Ferrari in the constructors, but it's 22 points [behind] now, which is quite big. We need some good points in the next two.\" Button said that McLaren had held more talks with him about next year's car since Hamilton's decision to quit the team for Mercedes. \"The car is quite unusual in the way that it works,\" he added. \"It works really well for Lewis, and works really well for me at times. But the consistency isn't there.\" But it only works well for Hamilton when it does not break down. Hamilton has often been outstanding this season but has been frustrated by pit-lane mistakes and, more recently, poor reliability. He dominated the weekend in Abu Dhabi and stormed away from his 25th pole position into a comfortable lead, only to pull out before the halfway stage because of an electrical problem, evoking memories of his gearbox failure in Singapore, when again he was running away with the race. \"It's twice in the last five races,\" he said. \"And the cars, apart from India, have had problems in all five. In Singapore we had the gearbox failure, at Suzuka a rear rollbar malfunction, before qualifying and in the race, and in Korea a rear rollbar failure. Then we had India, which was fine, and then here. So that's four hardcore difficult weekends.\" Hamilton added: \"I've been on pole position seven times this year. I have only won three times. In the other ones we've had failures and issues with pit stops and so on. If my car was as reliable as Sebastian's or Fernando's I would be right up with them now. But the team is strong and they will always bounce back.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
