I can't see my opponent's face, let alone peer deep into the whites of his eyes, but I know he's sitting in Amarillo, Texas, using the (presumably) false name of FatMan, and has been playing pretty aggressively for the past three hours. To call or not to call? In this cyberspace poker game I've got only 15 seconds to decide, much less than in a regular game. But this is a regular poker game, played for real money, and the chat-box shows the dealer telling me to hurry up and make my move. I'm still dithering when a ping tells me I've been 'timed out', or automatically folded. Just as well, for FatMan turns out to have a pair of aces against my pair of kings. And the final card is another ace, giving him an unbeatable hand. A 'pony' saved, in poker parlance, leaving me $1,700 to play on with. Not too bad, as I started with the daily maximum of $600. I click the box offering me the chance to sit out the next few hands, and go walkabout in the action-packed 'lobby' of www.pokerstars.com, one of dozens of websites taking over this popular game, made respectable by books and TV tournaments. The constantly changing noticeboard shows me there are more than 3,000 people playing at some 350 tables on this website alone. The figures are much the same at pokerstars' main rivals, partypoker.com and paradisepoker.com, not to mention planetpoker.com and the UK-based Ladbrokes, now the second-largest site in the world. If it's 2am here, it's 9pm yesterday along the eastern seaboard of the United States, 6pm in the American West, and God knows what time in Sydney, Stockholm, Monte Carlo and Warsaw, where the other players at my table are signed in from. They can fake their names - you have to, in fact, as all normal names have long since been collared - and they can fake what they look like in the little round slots offering the chance to post a likeness. The woman beside me is probably a man. But they can't fake where they're from, which you can discover by sliding your cursor over their name. That information is hooked up to their line of credit, be it US bank account or (as in my case) credit card. When you claim your winnings, they send you a dollar cheque. And the system seems to work. All honest and above board. It certainly worked for an American player with the wonderful name of Chris Moneymaker, who won the $2.5 million first prize in this year's World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, after starting out on PokerStars with $40. It's the biggest parlay in the history of the game, and it's turned every poker player I know into an internet junkie. Among the countless other addicts, snooker champ Steve Davis tells me he's hooked on internet poker. He and his pals Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams and promoter Barry Hearn all play together (under pseudonyms, of course) on the site co-run by Hearn's Matchroom with Ladbroke's, pokermillion.com, an adjunct of the Sky TV series of the same name. 'I was already an internet junkie,' says Davis, 'downloading music and running my own website, but poker has taken over most of the time I spend online. If you ask me, it's the best reason for having the internet.' In the olden days, outside our regular games in people's homes, we poker addicts would have had to wait till 2pm, get out the car and head down to our local cardroom (even in London, there's only one left). Even then, we might have had to wait an hour or two to get a seat in the game of our choice. Now poker is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. No one can see you, nor can you see them. But, boy, do you get to know them. Or do you? Internet poker is subtly different from the real thing. Part of the appeal of poker is the backchat at the table. All that is miraculously recreated on the net, up to a point, by means of that chat-box, in which I can type in 'Nice hand' to show FatMan I'm a good loser (or am pretending to be), or 'Up Yours!' if I want to upset StetsonHat from Dallas in Seat Six. Not being able to see their faces is the worst thing, on top of the hectic speed at which the game is played. There's no doubt I'm playing worse tonight than I would at a real table. I'm making calls I shouldn't make, because no one can see me squirming with embarrassment. And because, although I'm playing for real money, it still feels like a game I'm playing on my computer rather than a real poker game, where vital decisions take a tad more time. 'It's even more addictive than face-to-face poker,' says the playwright Patrick Marber, an old sparring partner of mine at the green baize. Hearn prefers the word 'compelling', which has a 'less pejorative' ring. But Marber readily admits he needs his regular fix. 'I go through phases of playing every night before I go to bed. And then I try to steel myself to phases without. But it's tough, very tough.' I'm finding much the same myself, as FatMan bets big at me again. Hey, let him exercise his ego for a while. Mine's under control. This time I exert some self-discipline, fold and check out of the table in search of the safer world of poker tournaments. Everyone I've talked to lost in their first month on the net, as the switch from real to computerised poker takes some getting used to. There are some very good players in cyberspace, who have adjusted their games to computer dealing - slightly different from human, random dealing - and the suspicion that some players are computerised 'shills', invented by the websites. Maybe some opponents are partners sitting in the same room, clever enough to falsify their location, working together to nail the other players? Maybe that 'bad beat' was the computer favouring one of its own? Maybe these offshore websites will just run away with all our money one day? 'They're making so much dough they don't have to,' says Roy Houghton, a cardroom manager forced by Britain's antique gaming legislation to run 'semi-legal' tournaments above a London pub. 'It's in their interests to keep it straight.' The websites take a small 'rake' from each pot, which varies with the size of the game. With so many hands per hour at so many hundreds of tables, they're making tens of thousands a day. Journalist Victoria Coren, one of Britain's leading female players, has all but given up cash games in favour of internet tournaments. 'The financial risk is lower,' she explains, 'and the standard of play is more consistent.' Now she wins more than she loses. Last week saw the launch of the first world championships on the web, with a guaranteed $1m in prize money. Eleven events in different poker disciplines over 11 days climax next Sunday in the Big One, a No Limit Hold 'Em tourney, which costs $1,000 to enter but offers a first prize of at least $250,000. But enough of this chat. Now you must excuse me, as FatMan's money seems to be going to his head. He's just lost a big hand he shouldn't even have been playing. Time for me to get back in the action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
