Lizzie Vereker, the curvy, middle-aged wife whose rat of a husband is cheating on her, is contemplating her misery and \u201cfeeling rather old and dried-up\u201d. So she rubs \u201cskin-food into her face, only to realise she\u2019d forgotten her neck, which is supposed to betray your age most, so she rubbed the excess skin-food down into it. Then she remembered you were supposed never to rub skin-food downwards as it made your face droop. Would her life have been different, she wondered, if she\u2019d always remembered to rub skin-food upwards? Would James have stayed faithful to her?\u201d Lizzie gets her happy ending (with a corpulent Cockney millionaire). She\u2019s also left me, on the rare occasions I remember to use any \u201cskin-food\u201d (I like to call it \u201cmoisturiser\u201d), carefully rubbing it upwards. She\u2019s no middle-aged cliche, but a survey of more than 1,000 women over 40 has found that more than half (51%) feel that older women in books do fall into \u201ccliched roles\u201d. Fifty per cent of the women surveyed said that older characters are shown \u201cas baffled by smartphones, computers or the internet\u201d, 35% felt older women were portrayed as \u201cuninterested\u201d when it came to sex scenes, and 21% said women came across as \u201cdesperate\u201d. Only 10% felt older women were portrayed as \u201csexy\u201d. Carried out by Gransnet and HarperCollins\u2019 division HQ, the survey heralds the launch of a fiction competition for women writers over the age of 40, for stories featuring a lead character over the age of 40. HQ executive publisher Lisa Milton admits that while the imprint publishes \u201cmany\u201d books by women over 40, and \u201cmany\u201d with female characters over 40, it\u2019s \u201cnot enough\u201d. \u201cWe know that women over 50 are the fastest-growing group of workers in the UK, and it\u2019s important that we publish to reflect the world around us,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a laudable initiative \u2013 it was only a year ago that the actor and writer Barbara Ewing was talking about how her novel, The Actresses, about women in their 50s, had been issued with a cover featuring a young woman; Hilary Mantel described women over 50 as \u201cthe invisible generation\u201d. But there are an awful lot of excellent novels featuring older women out there already. From my own beloved Jilly\u2019s Etta Bancroft in Jump! (\u201csweet, kind, still beautiful\u201d) to Jonas Jonasson, Rachel Joyce, Joanna Cannon and Libby Page, elderly protagonists aren\u2019t hard to find. I adored Alice LaPlante\u2019s murder mystery Turn of Mind, about a murder suspect with Alzheimer\u2019s; Kazuo Ishiguro, Nobel laureate no less, features an elderly couple at the heart of The Buried Giant. MC Beaton provides some middle-aged detection in Agatha Raisin, and there\u2019s a wealth of middle-aged protagonists negotiating the vicissitudes of life and family in books from Elizabeth Buchan, Harriet Evans, Anne Tyler and Elena Ferrante. I\u2019ve just finished Anne Youngson\u2019s gentle, moving, joyous Meet Me at the Museum. Shortlisted for the Costa first novel prize and recent winner of the Paul Torday Memorial prize \u2013 Youngson, by the way, published it when she was 70 \u2013 it follows the letters exchanged between a grandmother in her 60s in East Anglia, and a museum curator in Denmark. Youngson\u2019s protagonist, Tina, is beautifully realised \u2013 and although there\u2019s no sex, desperate or otherwise, she\u2019s perfectly capable of sending an email. Youngson\u2019s editor at Transworld, Jane Lawson, acknowledges that older women in fiction can often be predatory, lonely or suffering from dementia. But Tina is \u201cnone of these\u201d. \u201cShe is a strong character in her own right,\u201d Lawson says, \u201cwith no issues or insufferable discontent. The story comes from the central character\u2019s own determination to find a new life, a new experience. She doesn\u2019t feel remotely encumbered by age and she is not defined by her age. My own bookclub of fortysomethings adored this book, not for its depiction of a \u2018feisty\u2019 older woman, but simply for its tender insight into the human heart, its warmth, and even its bite.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
