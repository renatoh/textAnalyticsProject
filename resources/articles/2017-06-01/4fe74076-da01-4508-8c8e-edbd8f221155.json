Nadal, who won his 10th French Open on Sunday said: \u201cI am very sorry to say that I am not going to be able play Queen\u2019s next week. I was hoping to take some days off and then be ready. But, at 31, and after a long clay-court season with all of the emotions of Roland Garros, and after speaking to my team and doctor, I have decided my body needs to rest if I am going to be ready to play Wimbledon. \u201cI am sad to make this decision because I love Queen\u2019s. I won the tournament in 2008 and every time I reached the Wimbledon final it was after playing Queen\u2019s.\u201d The announcement nevertheless comes as a surprise and throws into doubt Nadal\u2019s chances of winning a third Wimbledon title. He has been in phenomenal form on his favourite clay and breezed through the French Open in near-record time, thrashing Stan Wawrinka for the loss of six games in three quick sets and showed no obvious physical distress. He did hint in his victory press conference that the grass season made extra demands on his knees, which have let him down several times during his long career. If he is not confident of getting through the warm-up tournament, he might be more vulnerable at Wimbledon than previously thought. The integrity of Queen\u2019s remains intact however, with the world No 1 Andy Murray committed to defending his title. Wawrinka, the reigning US Open champion, the 2014 winner Grigor Dimitrov, and last year\u2019s runner-up Milos Raonic will join Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, Nick Kyrgios, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Marin Cilic and Tomas Berdych in a quality field. Britain\u2019s Kyle Edmund, the world No44, has been added to the draw for the first time, after the withdrawal of the world No35 Diego Schwartzman through injury. Roger Federer, meanwhile, returns from a 10-week break during the clay season in Europe refreshed for Wimbledon, and told the ATP on Tuesday he was committed to a full schedule for the rest of the season. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough breaks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a practice world champion now, and that\u2019s not who I want to be. I want to be a champ on the match courts, so I\u2019m going to be playing a regular schedule for the second part of the season.\u201d New LTA chief Lloyd will focus on Murray success Scott Lloyd, a former teenage prodigy, has been named the new chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association. The 41-year-old leisure industry magnate starts work in January but set out his broad aims after his appointment yesterday. \u201cThe current success of Andy and Jamie Murray, Johanna Konta, Gordon Reid and others is helping inspire a whole new generation to give this great sport a go,\u201d Lloyd said. He was a good junior but chose to make his career in business rather than sport. He certainly had the pedigree. His father, David, was an accomplished Davis Cup player and later Great Britain team captain and his uncle, John, was an Australian Open finalist. Konta, meanwhile, chalked up her 300th career win when Tara Moore retired in the second set of their first-round match at the Aegon Open in Nottingham, leading 6-4, 3-0 when her compatriot called it a day due to a foot injury. Heather Watson lost 6-2, 6-3 against the fourth seed Alison Riske."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
