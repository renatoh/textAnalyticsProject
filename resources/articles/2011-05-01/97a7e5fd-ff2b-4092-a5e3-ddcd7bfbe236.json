Sir Alex Ferguson said the player had attended the match \u2013 \"He was in the dressing room at the end,\" he said \u2013 despite his disappointment at learning the news, though he was not spotted during the game itself among those omitted in the stands. Berbatov, a \u00a330m signing from Tottenham Hotspur in 2009 and the joint leading scorer in the Premier League this season, has not scored in the Champions League since October 2008, yet the United manager had admitted the decision had prompted \"heartache\" in the buildup. \"Picking my team was easy, but my subs were very difficult,\" Ferguson said. \"I tended to overload in the midfield because I thought that was the area that was most important in terms of the way Barcelona play \u2013 the game could be decided there \u2013 and the work you need in that central area. \"I only had the one defender to have options in midfield and wide, so it came down to a choice between Michael Owen and Dimitar Berbatov. If you're looking for someone to nick a goal in the last few minutes, with Owen's experience, that's why I took that decision.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
