An extraordinary confluence of adverse events dictates that Pardew\u2019s first meeting with David Meyler since he head-butted the Hull City midfielder in March appears unlikely to prove anything more than the merest footnote to events at St James\u2019 Park on Saturday. Equipped with numerous banners and placards, Newcastle fans are planning assorted anti-Pardew protests before, during and after Hull\u2019s visit. With his job very much on the line, the 53-year-old\u2019s mood is unlikely to be soothed by the presence of Steve Bruce and Hatem Ben Arfa in the adjacent dugout. While Bruce would reportedly not be averse to swapping his role in charge of the visitors for Pardew\u2019s office, Ben Arfa could easily become a focal point of Tyneside dissension. Although a big favourite of the St James\u2019 crowd, the gifted Frenchman fell out with Newcastle\u2019s manager and was loaned to the KC Stadium on transfer deadline day. The terms of that deal preclude him playing on Saturday but Bruce hopes that positioning Ben Arfa on his bench will aid Hull\u2019s cause. Despite Fabricio Coloccini, Newcastle\u2019s captain, having begged home supporters to get behind the Premier League\u2019s bottom team, Pardew is preparing for the worst. \u201cOf course I\u2019m bracing myself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to wave to the crowd and say \u2018Hi everyone, I\u2019m happy, how are you today?\u2019 That\u2019s not happening.\u201d Much of the anger stems from Newcastle\u2019s collapse during the second half of last season. They have won only five Premier League games since January, with no League victories as yet this season. When they did beat relegated Cardiff at the end of the last campaign, the hostility towards Pardew was such that he remained penned back in his dugout, unwilling to venture into the technical area lest it provoke wholesale anarchy. \u201cThat was the first time I\u2019ve ever experienced anything like that,\u201d acknowledged Pardew, who has described his detractors as being in the grip of \u201cmass hysteria\u201d. He knows that things could turn far uglier on Saturday. \u201cI will gauge the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about being a coach who can control certain situations \u2013 and these things can make you stronger.\u201d He believes Newcastle will surround him with extra security personnel but has not requested such back-up. \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m not scared, I\u2019m not in fear,\u201d said a manager whose side have scored only three goals while conceding nine in four League games this season. \u201cThat\u2019s not an ego or arrogance thing, it\u2019s just the way I\u2019m wired. I want to get the game played and get a win.\u201d It does not help that six of Newcastle\u2019s seven new faces this summer lacked previous experience of the English game. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what the new signings are going to be like,\u201d conceded Pardew, who has reason to feel let down by the failure of Mike Ashley, the club\u2019s owner, to sign the proven striker and central defender the team craved this summer. \u201cI\u2019ll look for players who I think are struggling with the situation and, to protect them, it may well be that I make an early change. It might be that the situation gets too much for an individual. \u201cI think it\u2019s important they understand the history and dynamics of this football club. I have tried to express to the new players that this is a place where emotions run high. You get unbelievably brilliant atmospheres which take your breath away but you\u2019re going to get the other side from time to time. It\u2019s an emotional crowd and the players are going to have to deal with that.\u201d Pardew\u2019s failure to keep his own emotions in check prompted his infamous altercation with Meyler. \u201cI\u2019ve had to change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incident I regret. I\u2019ll shake his hand and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll smile at me. It\u2019s something I like to think I\u2019ve learned from.\u201d Bruce learned some harsh lessons during a sometimes awkward stint as Sunderland\u2019s manager and he expressed sympathy for his counterpart\u2019s plight while simultaneously sensing an opportunity. \u201cI know what Alan\u2019s going through,\u201d said Hull\u2019s Geordie manager. \u201cThe north-east\u2019s a difficult, difficult place to manage. The pressure seems to quadruple and when there\u2019s a crisis there\u2019s really a crisis. Some of the nonsense is ridiculous but we have to be mercenary enough to try and take advantage.\u201d Coloccini can only hope his appeal strips the edge off the anti-Pardew feeling. \u201cWe understand that things can get frustrating,\u201d wrote the defender in his column for Saturday\u2019s match programme. \u201cBut we need your support. It will not be an easy game. It\u2019s very important that you\u2019re right behind us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
