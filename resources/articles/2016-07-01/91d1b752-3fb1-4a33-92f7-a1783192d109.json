The idea was a spoiling tactic by opponents, led by former prime minister Tony Abbott. It will be expensive and is unnecessary. Even if we hold one, the decision whether to allow same sex couples to marry will need to be confirmed by parliament. And, more importantly, there is something demeaning about asking a minority group that has suffered discrimination throughout our history to have to politely ask the majority to pass judgment on the equality of their relationships. And yet it looks like we will have one, later this year or early next year. We haven\u2019t seen the question to be put to the Australian public, and we haven\u2019t seen the legislation that will outline how the vote will be conducted. These details are crucial. Labor and the Greens have not yet said whether they will support the legislation to enable the plebiscite to be held. Labor has flagged that it will introduce a bill to legalise same sex marriage when parliament resumes next month, but that seems more a political tactic than a practical one. At this stage, it seems likely that enough of the cross bench senators \u2013 Jacqui Lambie, Pauline Hanson, the Nick Xenophon team and others \u2013 will support the plebiscite. The government took this policy to the election, and for prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to renege on it now isn\u2019t going to happen. So if we are to have this plebiscite, it is possible, just possible, that a national conversation about allowing two people of the same gender the rights of heterosexual couples to marry \u2013 and the symbolism of full acceptance that would signify \u2013 could be a unifying moment for this country. I have little doubt a plebiscite would pass, and the people will have had their say on a parliamentary process that has refused to reflect their will on this issue for so long. The fear that this will be a damaging debate is a real one, especially given the anger and sullenness consuming our politics, but it\u2019s better to trust citizens than to fear them. A plebiscite also might \u2013 only might \u2013 be a chance to show how we can disagree with each other with vigour without abusing each other. We are in an era when arguments, especially on social issues around identity, collapse before they begin into name calling and dehumanising the \u201cother\u201d as bigots, misogynists, racists, or homophobes. People can be all these things, but other people may have reservations about same sex marriage, or haven\u2019t thought about it much or yearn to ask what might seem a stupid question. They shouldn\u2019t feel too nervous to do so for fear of being labeled a bigot. It\u2019s possible that the only way same sex marriage supporters could lose a plebiscite is if they abuse people who have reservations. The lessons are all there in the Irish referendum in May last year, when two out of three voters in this most Catholic of countries supported same sex marriage. Tiernan Brady was the Yes Equality\u2019s political director. He has moved to Sydney to help the campaign and will play a key role if we have a plebiscite. It was Brady who inadvertently gave the Irish campaign its spirit, after he saw a woman during the Scottish Independence referendum with a home-made sign around her neck. It read: \u201cI\u2019m voting Yes, Ask me Why\u201d. That became the theme of marriage equality meetings across the country. According to a book on the campaign, Ireland Says Yes, same sex marriage campaigners made a deliberate decision to avoid a bullying or abusive tone. It became about families. Mothers and fathers talked about equality for their sons and daughters, as did grandparents. Well-known people like former president Mary McAleese spoke of her gay son Justin. \u201cA yes vote costs the rest of us nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cA no vote costs our gay children everything.\u201d The Irish campaign allowed space for someone with questions, or doubts, to raise them and have them answered with respect. It learned from failed attempts to introduce same sex marriage in several American states and from a failed referendum to legalise divorce in Ireland in 1986 \u2013 it was eventually passed in 1995. Anne Connolly, who worked on those divorce campaigns, explained to an interviewer that in the first referendum people who had fears about divorce didn\u2019t feel comfortable expressing them. The campaign \u201cshot down these fears, or positioned these as being luddite, conservative, reactionary or unsympathetic to the plights of people who found themselves in broken marriages,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more we created a confrontational, conflictual positioning, the more we were actually pushing them into a No vote mode.\u201d That is a crucial lesson, not just for the same sex marriage campaign, but for all our contested political conversations. The chairman of Australian Marriage Equality, Alex Greenwich, acknowledges a nasty tone on both sides to some of the debate in Australia in the past and says that preparations for a plebiscite already underway are taking the Irish lead. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that that an issue that shouldn\u2019t have been made political has been made political,\u201d he says. Brady stresses that it is \u201cterribly destructive\u201d to abuse people who disagree, to shut them down. \u201cOf all groups in society lesbian and gay people in particular should know the impact of being called names,\u201d he says. The Irish campaign was tough for lesbians and gays, and some arguments from the No side were deeply hurtful. Brady says it would be better if Australia avoided a public vote, but he also believes the process brought Ireland closer together and contains lessons about how other controversial debates could be conducted. \u201cWe were very conscious that we all had to live in the same country the next day, so the campaign had to be one that brought people together instead of dividing them. It\u2019s about how do you stop this being an angry debate on television and be one about conversations in families and communities and workplaces.\u201d The toughest part in Ireland was answering red-herring arguments from some No campaigners, arguments that are already being put here. One of the key No talking points was that same sex marriage would lead to commercial surrogacy. Brady found himself pointing out again and again that the issues are separate. In the end, though, \u201cIreland was transformed by the process\u201d. \u201cWhen you run a positive campaign, you do bring people together. The debate wasn\u2019t about beating someone else, it was about persuading someone else. That means the whole world when it comes how people engage with each other when they disagree with each other.\u201d If the marriage equality campaign can do that, it will have made an enormous contribution, not just to their cause, but to the bigger cause of how to disagree with respect. If a plebiscite can bring this country together on this one issue, it might not prove to be a waste of time and money, after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
