Trump\u2019s new nominee, Alexander Acosta, is the dean of the Florida International University College of Law and the former US attorney for the southern district of Florida. He is Trump\u2019s selection to replace Andrew Puzder, whose nomination foundered after accusations of alleged wrongdoing in his businesses and personal life. But Acosta\u2019s record is not without its own potential sticking points. From August 2003 to June 2005, Acosta served as the assistant attorney general in charge of the justice department\u2019s civil rights division. During that time, the division was roundly accused of a lax approach to racial bias and voting rights and of taking the politics of a lawyer into consideration when hiring new attorneys and assigning or transferring cases. Those accusations became the subject of hearings on Capitol Hill and a 2008 joint investigation by the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility, which singled out Acosta personally for a failure of oversight. Acosta, the investigation concluded, had failed to act on \u201cred flags\u201d about the conduct of his subordinate in charge of hiring. The employee, Bradley Schlozman, was ultimately hauled before a congressional committee on charges that he had used political affiliations in vetting potential civil rights attorneys. Federal law prohibits the use of political or ideological affiliation to evaluate candidates for the justice department\u2019s career attorney positions. The OIG report that chastised Acosta concluded that Schlozman distinguished between \u201cright-thinking Americans\u201d and \u201clibs\u201d or \u201ccommies\u201d when hiring new attorneys, and that Acosta was aware that Schlozman had forwarded a racially insensitive email around the office. Despite his own misgivings about Schlozman, the report said, Acosta did nothing to prevent Schlozman from becoming his replacement when he left the civil rights division. In an email, Schlozman said: \u201cI strongly disagree with the preposterous allegations leveled by the highly partisan inspector general back in 2008, most of which have been refuted.\u201d He provided the link to a Weekly Standard article which disputed many of the report\u2019s claims. \u201cI\u2019d also note that the Obama DoJ\u2019s civil rights division engaged in politicized hiring at a level exponentially worse than anything I was even accused of,\u201d he said. \u201cBattling the unprofessional attorneys who populated much of the Division during my tenure was a herculean task, but I am extremely proud of my tenure there.\u201d Acosta reads as an odd selection for Trump\u2019s cabinet. He has been outspoken in his defense of Muslim Americans and their religious civil liberties, criticizing policies that prohibit headscarfs. And unlike many Trump picks, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is one of a career civil servant. Acosta has clerked for the conservative US supreme court justice Samuel Alito, served on the National Labor Relations Board, and worked as a federal prosecutor. Still, his 2003 appointment to lead the civil rights division elicited mixed feelings from civil rights groups. \u201cThere is no broad-based support for Acosta among civil rights groups, as of yet,\u201d Nancy Zirkin, of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said at the time. \u201cSeveral organizations are expressing concern.\u201d The Bush administration enacted policies that seemed to make politicized hiring inevitable. In 2002, the then attorney general, John Ashcroft, disbanded the hiring committees made up of veteran career attorneys and placed the authority to hire with political appointees. A year later, Acosta issued a memo within the civil rights division that further reduced the ability of career civil servants to vet potential hires. The changes took their toll. From 2003 to 2006, only 42% of new hires in the Civil Rights Division had civil rights experience, compared with 77% of new hires in the two years prior, according to an investigation by the Boston Globe. The Globe report, for which reporters obtained hundreds of pages of hiring data from an open records request, also found that the new hires\u2019 credentials skewed political. Eleven out of 45 lawyers hired in that period were members of the Federalist Society, a conservative thinktank, and seven were members of the Republican National Lawyers Association. During the same time period, the Globe reported, the civil rights division brought far fewer voting rights cases or cases involving employment bias against black people than before, and more cases alleging discrimination against white people or Christians. Morale among career civil rights attorneys became so low, some complained to the Globe, that a 2005 buyout offered led to 63 resignations \u2013 twice the average number since the late 1990s. \u201cThe clear emphasis has been to hire individuals with conservative credentials,\u201d Jon Greenbaum, a career civil rights attorney, told the Globe. Greenbaum left in 2003. \u201cIf anything, a civil rights background is considered a liability.\u201d David Becker, a career voting rights attorney who accepted the buyout in 2005, told the Globe that the division replaced lawyers like him with \u201cinexperienced ideologues, virtually none of which have any civil rights or voting rights experiences\u201d. It was during these turbulent years that Acosta oversaw the civil rights division and delegated hiring to two subordinates who were later accused of improperly considering applicants\u2019 political or ideological affiliations. Acosta gave final authority on hiring to Sheldon Bradshaw, his primary deputy assistant attorney general, who in turn turned over most hiring decisions to another deputy, Schlozman. According to several members of the division who spoke to investigators, Schlozman ran the hiring process with little oversight or scrutiny. Schlozman and his superior frequently referred to applicants they favored as being \u201cgood American\u201d, \u201cfine American\u201d, \u201cright-thinking American\u201d, or being \u201con the team\u201d, which investigators concluded were codewords for conservative. To describe applicants or career civil rights attorneys he didn\u2019t like, investigators said, Schlozman used the terms \u201clibs\u201d and \u201ccommies\u201d. A Washington Post investigation reported that Schlozman had transferred three minority women out of their positions over their supervisors\u2019 objections to \u201cmake room for some good Americans\u201d. While he denied those reports, Schlozman conceded, in testimony to a congressional committee, that he often bragged of hiring conservative lawyers. The inspector general\u2019s investigation did not establish whether Acosta knew about the signs that Schlozman was engaged in political hiring. And Acosta claimed that no one approached him with complaints of inappropriate hiring practices. But at least one official claimed that she complained to Acosta that Schlozman had hired as her deputy \u201can applicant whom she considered unqualified even for a line attorney position\u201d. The official, special litigation chief Shanetta Cutlar, told investigators that Acosta brushed her off. Acosta claimed he did not recall the conversation. He did, however, recall having a discussion in December 2004 with a different section chief about Schlozman\u2019s management style. Acosta was also aware that in August 2004, Schlozman had mass-forwarded an email containing a racist joke, writing: \u201cY\u2019all will appreciate [this].\u201d In the email, a colleague said he liked his coffee \u201cMary Frances Berry style \u2013 black and bitter\u201d. Berry was the former chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Acosta claimed he demanded a written apology from Schlozman for forwarding the email, although investigators never found such an apology when they searched Schlozman\u2019s correspondence. Overall, Acosta acknowledged to investigators that he was aware of potential problems with Schlozman\u2019s conduct and formed his own concerns. But Acosta, investigators concluded, did not alert anyone in the justice department of his concerns. In fact, after Acosta left the civil rights division in 2005, Schlozman served as his acting replacement for five months before becoming an interim US attorney. It was not until 2007 that Acosta took any action to prevent Schlozman from obtaining a position of power. At that time, Acosta claims, he helped stymie Schlozman\u2019s hiring as director of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys. A White House spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Cutlar, who held her position until 2010, could not be reached."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
