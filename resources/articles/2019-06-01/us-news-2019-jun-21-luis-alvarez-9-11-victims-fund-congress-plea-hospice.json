Retired New York police department detective Luis Alvarez used what he expects to be his final interview to make a final impassioned plea to Congress to renew the 9/11 victims fund and deal with an \u201cepidemic\u201d of Ground Zero-related illnesses. Alvarez said on Thursday that after nearly 70 rounds of chemotherapy, doctors had told him there was nothing more they could do. He was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2016 that has spread to his liver. \u201cIt\u2019s an epidemic. There\u2019s going to be more and more first responders getting sick. And our government has to take care of them. It\u2019s just a matter of decency, a matter of doing the right thing. We did the right thing when we went down there. Now it\u2019s the government\u2019s turn to do the right thing by us,\u201d Alvarez, 53, told Fox News. Alvarez said going through cancer has been stressful for his whole family. \u201cWe need to ease the stress on the first responders,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd let them know that they\u2019re not alone. That the government is here to back them up, to give them the support they need, the financial support that they\u2019re going to need when they get sick. It\u2019s just a matter of time. You know, most of us that were down there \u2013 it\u2019s just a matter of time before we get sick.\u201d It came just nine days after he received a standing ovation in Washington DC, where Stewart and other first responders addressed the House judiciary committee, to speak out against plans to cut 9/11 compensation by up to 70%. \u201cYou made me come down here the day before my 69th round of chemo, and I\u2019m going to make sure that you never forget to take care of the 9/11 responders,\u201d he said at the hearing. But the following day his health took a downturn and doctors concluded that his liver had shut down. Speaking with his son David by his side from a hospice in Long Island, near New York City, Alavarez said to Fox News host Shepard Smith on Thursday: \u201cWe need this bill passed, Shep. It\u2019s got to be passed quickly and efficiently so we never have to come down to Washington again and lobby.\u201d He said he was comfortable and \u201cat peace\u201d surrounded by his family and that he had \u201cno regrets whatsoever\u201d. He insisted that he was just doing what any fire, police or emergency worker would have done when he spent three months at the site of the 9/11 attacks, searching for remains and clearing up in a smoldering, toxic pile after terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the World Trade Center. He added: \u201cI\u2019m nobody special. I did what all the other guys did. And now we\u2019re paying the price for it.\u201d He said he is leaving his sons David, 29, Tyler, 19, and Ben, 14, \u201cwithout a father\u201d. While he said he was \u201clucky\u201d to have had the heathcare that he has, there are people in his position who do not. He said it was time for the government to act: \u201cWe just want the money to be there for our families so that God forbid they do get sick, they\u2019re covered.\u201d He said they were told the air was safe \u2013 which it was not \u2013 but even if they had known it was unsafe they would have gone in regardless, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what we do\u201d. He said the problem is a US-wide issue among first responders who travelled to New York after the 9/11 attacks to help and warned others to be vigilant. \u201cI just want them to know, hey if you were down at Ground Zero \u2026 get yourself checked out. Because you could be sick from ground zero,\u201d he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
