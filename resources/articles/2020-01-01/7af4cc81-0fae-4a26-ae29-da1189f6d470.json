Anne Twomey, a professor at the University of Sydney, issued the warning on Tuesday after Scott Morrison asked the attorney general to \u201cclarify\u201d and \u201caddress\u201d legal issues with the program which the auditor general found was skewed towards marginal seats. Two leading plaintiff law firms, Slater and Gordon and Maurice Blackburn, have offered to run a class action or test case against the program, citing comments by the Australian National Audit Office that it was \u201cnot evident to the ANAO what the legal authority was\u201d for McKenzie, the former sports minister, to approve grants.\u2019 Coledale football club \u2013 already the most outspoken critics among the clubs which missed out on funding \u2013 has already contacted Maurice Blackburn about launching a case. Twomey told ABC News Breakfast the commonwealth is \u201conly given limited powers under the constitution\u201d and \u201cthere is no power given to it in relation to sport\u201d. Twomey cited the case brought by Ron Williams against the federal government\u2019s chaplaincy scheme, in which the high court found the commonwealth can\u2019t spend money unless there is parliamentary authorisation and \u201cunless there\u2019s some support in the constitution for it\u201d. Twomey suggested the commonwealth could argue the community sport infrastructure grants program comes under the \u201cnationhood power\u201d, but she doubted that \u201cresurfacing an oval\u201d would constitute a \u201cnational emergency\u201d or something that states are unable to do. \u201cWe know that the states can, and do, give out sports grants. \u201cSo, it doesn\u2019t seem to fit either of those, which means there\u2019s a bit of a problem in terms of supporting this program.\u201d Twomey said the lack of ministerial power is a secondary reason the program may be unlawful. \u201cThat\u2019s a power that\u2019s been vested by the legislation in Sports Australia \u2026 and that means that there are some difficulties there in terms of working out how it is that the minister could make the final decision in relation to these grants. \u201cSo, the grants themselves may well be unlawful.\u201d Martin Smith, a coach and member of the Coledale football club\u2019s infrastructure working group, told Guardian Australia its executive is still considering launching a case and despite reservations about the time commitment and potential negative fallout \u201cthe early signal is, yes, we\u2019d like to do it\u201d. The Coledale Waves are a rapidly growing club, which reached 600 registered players by adding more teams for women and men over 18 despite having only one field. Smith said the club had \u201cexpended significant hours\u201d on an application to upgrade its facilities, because the club\u2019s field has no lights and no space for both storage and women\u2019s change rooms. \u201cWe were probably in that group of recommended clubs that missed out due to the minister\u2019s intervention. \u201cDo we feel angry? Yes, probably - and disappointed that taxpayer money was spent in this way. \u201cThe class action \u2013 if it comes to that \u2013 I believe is a worthy thing. Governments should not be able to act in this reprehensible manner.\u201d Slater and Gordon practice group leader, Andrew Baker, noted that one of the \u201cmain advantages\u201d of a class action is that any claim \u201cwill automatically cover all groups that fall within the class\u201d. He said this was an \u201cimportant feature\u201d given clubs \u201care probably going to be reluctant\u201d to bring individual claims because they will need to apply for grant funding in future. In its scathing report, the ANAO said: \u201cA significant shortcoming was that, while the program guidelines identified that the minister for sport would approve [community sport infrastructure grant] funding, there are no records evidencing that the minister was advised of the legal basis on which the minister could undertake an approval role, and it is not evident to the ANAO what the legal authority was.\u201d It noted that although the sports minister has a power to direct Sports Australia \u201cit was not used\u201d. The attorney general, Christian Porter, told Guardian Australia the government had noted the comments concerning the legal basis for ministerial involvement and \u201cgiven the lack of any conclusive view offered by the auditor general, the prime minister has sought further consideration of the issue, which I am attending to\u201d. McKenzie and the prime minister Scott Morrison insist that all projects granted funding were eligible and no rules were broken in the administration of the scheme. On Monday the sports grants scandal drew in Morrison after revelations that he had personally handed out grants in his electorate of Cook, including a $200,000 grant to the Lilli Pilli Football Club. The ABC reported that Lilli Pilli Football Club had started works in October 2018, despite Sports Australia guidelines stipulating that projects that have already commenced works are not eligible for funding. A spokesman for Sports Australia told Guardian Australia the club has \u201cbeen making progressive upgrades to [its] facilities\u201d and its grant application, submitted in September 2018, related to the second stage of projects. \u201cThe club\u2019s second stage projects included the fit-out of gender-neutral change-rooms and a community room,\u201d he said. \u201cSport Australia notified the club of their successful grant application in December 2018, with work commencing on their second stage projects in January 2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
