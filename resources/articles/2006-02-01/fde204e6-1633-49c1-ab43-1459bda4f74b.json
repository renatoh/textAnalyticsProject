I'd persuaded my husband and two daughters to hire a 'traditional' thatched cottage in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland to experience the beautiful scenery and the friendliness of locals and to get to know my extended family a little better. From outside, the cottage looked beautiful, with its whitewashed walls, window boxes full of flowers, a bright red front door and surrounding fields. We parked the car and ran up the drive as we couldn't wait to see inside. The bubble burst as soon as we opened the door to be greeted by the smell of damp and a small gloomy room filled with old and dangerous-looking furniture. The kitchen was so small that only one person could stand in it at a time. The mattresses in the dark, damp bedrooms were lumpy and the shower room had smelly drains. The main bathroom was the only room that didn't smell badly and in an effort to calm myself, I sent the children out to play while I had a bath. I had hardly lowered myself into the tub when my husband burst in shouting that the thatched roof was on fire. He had lit a fire to warm and brighten up the living room, only to discover that the chimney was blocked. By the time I had managed to throw a towel around myself and run outside, my husband was attempting to put the fire out from ground level by chucking basins of water onto the roof as there was neither a ladder nor a fire extinguisher to hand. Several minutes later with the cottage roof still smouldering, we were greeted by a passing local: 'Are yous enjoying the sun?' Seemingly oblivious to the smoke and my semi-nakedness, he continued to chat away about the wonders of the Northern Irish coastline and countryside and even offered to supply us with free logs for our fire. He promised good weather for the coming week and wished us a happy and restful holiday before continuing his stroll. My husband and I spent the rest of the holiday taking it in turns to sleep on the sofa and the spare single bed, as the mattress on our bed felt like a rock. At least the torrential rain that followed for the rest of our stay ensured that the thatched roof didn't ignite again. \u00b7 Have you had a crap holiday?
