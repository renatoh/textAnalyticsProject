The latest row was sparked after Lord Heseltine, a former Tory deputy prime minister, said Conservative MPs should oust Mr Duncan Smith and install former chancellor Kenneth Clarke in his place with former defence secretary Michael Portillo as his deputy. Mr Duncan Smith dismissed the attack: \"It is one of the most irrelevant stories I have ever heard.\" He was immediately joined by Norman Tebbit, a former party chairman, who branded Lord Heseltine \"a serial Conservative assassin\". \"He did it to William Hague. Indeed, he did it to Margaret Thatcher. I suspect he would do it to any leader except Michael Heseltine. \"His fear is not that Iain Duncan Smith might lose the next election. His fear is that Iain Duncan Smith might win the election and lead a eurosceptic government that would refuse to submerge Britain in the proposed European republic.\" The current Tory chairwoman, Theresa May, also castigated Lord Heseltine and suggested that he \"take up golf, like every other retired person\". In an interview in today's Independent, Lord Heseltine says that unless the Tory leader is toppled there is \"not any prospect\" of the party having \"a ghost of a chance of winning the next election\". \"We've got a better shadow cabinet on the backbenches than we have in the actual shadow cabinet on the frontbench,\" he says. He calls on the parliamentary Conservative party to cast aside the newly written constitution giving the national membership the final say on a new leader. MPs should bypass the 350,000 members in the country, who last year rejected Mr Clarke in a ballot, he said. He admits, however, that such a move would be a \"constitutional aberration\". The Conservative leadership has also moved swiftly to play down Lord Heseltine's remarks. \"He has been saying this kind of thing for some time,\" said a spokesman. \"He said similar things before the last election when William Hague was leader. We regard this as nothing new at all.\" The Ulster Unionists have also been drawn into the fray, with some suggesting that the party could mount a reverse takeover of the Conservatives. Such a move could well ensure that David Trimble MP, the Unionist's leader, would become the leader of the merged party. David Trimble has so far dismissed the suggestion. He said: \"There are lots of things one might like to do if the opportunities are there, but that is not the issue at the moment.\" \"I am the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, that is a very onerous job in itself, and it gives me some insight into the problems that people have as leaders of other parties. \"I have no desire, no intention of taking on an even bigger task, I have enough problems of my own.\" But he acknowledged that he was interested in his party and the Tories working very closely together. \"I want to see Ulster Unionism at the heart of British politics. I don't see any justification for our being excluded from national politics, which in many respects we are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
