His opponent, Iran\u2019s No 1, Parham Maghsoodloo, is an ambitious former world junior champion, who before the start optimistically assessed his chances at 50-50. They played 90 minutes of 5+1 blitz (five minutes for the game plus a one-second per move increment), 60 minutes of 3+1 blitz and 30 minutes of 1+1 bullet. The first five games went very well for the Iranian, a win each with three draws, but then the No 1 got into his stride, aided by his opponent\u2019s hesitations and errors. Carlsen won the final five games of the 5+1 segment, highlighted by his impressive victory in game eight. Maghsoodloo\u2019s plan to use his queen\u2019s side pawns to box in Black\u2019s dark-squared bishop was artistically trumped by Carlsen\u2019s light-squared bishop at h7 targeting White\u2019s poorly protected long castled king. Carlsen then swept the first six games of the three-minute segment as the 20-year-old visibly crumbled, leaving a knight en prise in one game and losing on time in another. Even when Maghsoodloo broke the sequence with a draw, it was from a botched winning position. The 11-game sequence is not a record for the speed championship, as Hikaru Nakamura once won 18 straight against Hou Yifan. Carlsen eased up in the one-minute segment, which he showboated with a joke in a dead drawn ending where his knight and one pawn met bishop and two pawns with no passed pawns. He exchanged knight for bishop so as to demonstrate that, even playing instantly, he understood the technique of distant opposition in pawn endgames, a concept which Maghsoodloo\u2019s friend and former compatriot, Alireza Firouzja, had famously failed to do against Carlsen in Stavanger. As for the overall match, Carlsen summed it up: \u201cOnce it starts going south then it\u2019s all psychological.\u201d The chess.com speed event is a 16-player knock-out. If the seedings work out, Carlsen will meet elite grandmaster opponents in the quarter- and semi-finals, followed by a final against Nakamura or the US champion, Wesley So, who have both performed well against the champion in recent online events. Not Firouzja, though. The rising star, widely regarded as heir apparent to Carlsen, was eliminated in a first round tiebreak by Russia\u2019s Vladimir Fedoseev. Sixty years ago Mikhail Botvinnik, world champion on and off for 15 years, never played blitz and discouraged his pupils from it, but the floodgates opened up when Bobby Fischer and Mikhail Tal constantly honed their speed skills and Fischer won the first unofficial world blitz title in 1970. Now the frontier for speed players is one-minute bullet, one minute for all your moves, which is far too fast for the vast majority of ordinary players but whose image has been transformed by the patronage of Carlsen, Nakamura and Firouzja, the three best bulleteers in the world. Firouzja\u2019s surprise loss to Fedoseev this week was partly attributed to his preference for 1+0 bullet without the one second per move increment. And there are plenty who consider even 1+0 bullet too slow, and prefer to play hyperbullet, 30 seconds, or ultrabullet, 15 seconds for the entire game without increment. The lichess website is the popular choice for ultrabullet and has around 10,000 competitive players. For most of them, the game is as much or more a matter of flagging the opponent through a fast connection, swift mouse action and shrewd pre-moves which anticipate the opponent\u2019s replies, than the actual chess. One young English ultrabullet player always opens with 1 h2-h4-h5-h6. But when Carlsen plays ultrabullet, as he has done using the handle of DrNykterstein, 0.15+0 can often provide a coherent and even instructive game. Thus the world champion, whose influence and example has been a major factor in the current online chess boom, is also largely responsible for the niche popularity of a form of the game which would make Botvinnik turn in his grave. 3696: 1 Ng7+!
