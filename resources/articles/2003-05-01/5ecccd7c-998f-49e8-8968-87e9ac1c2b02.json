With \u00a32m worth of prize money, it is an event for which officials always impose a three-line whip on all the best players. But Padraig Harrington, the No1 attraction in European golf, No8 in the world and winner of last weekend's Deutsche Bank event in Hamburg, will be at home in Dublin, contemplating the half-million pounds or so he has won in the past two weeks. There is a lot of upper-lip stiffening going on at HQ at Wentworth and by the best and longest-serving sponsor the tour has known, Volvo. The Irishman is a significant loss to the tournament and everyone - himself included - realises it. But on Sunday night, even in the wave of relief that swept over him after his play-off victory over Thomas Bjorn, he was adamant that he would not be going to Wentworth. He has a simple explanation, followed by a series of justifications. \"I just don't play well on that course at this time of year,\" he said. \"I have to be realistic. I usually miss the cut and then spend the rest of the week beating my brains out on the practice ground with my coach trying to find out why. \"I mean, last year the winner was 19 under par and I can't even imagine how anyone could get that low on that course. I suppose it's a bit like me and The Belfry; I like that course, do well there and there must be players who wonder how I do that.\" His decision is not a complete surprise to the tour. When he set his schedule for the season it did not include the PGA for the foregoing reasons but officials hoped they could lean on a man essentially easy-going and obliging. But on Sunday he said: \"If I alter my schedule now it would mean competing six weeks in a row, including the US Open. That in turn could have disastrous consequences for the rest of the year.\" Harrington, well aware that qualifying for the Ryder Cup team starts in September, does not want to be tired or stale when those events come around. \"I realise,\" he said, \"that a good player should be able to play on any course at any time and maybe, given the form that I'm in, this would be a good time to try and find out how to play Wentworth. But I've made my decision and in any case it's very rare that the winner one week wins the next. You get three days of congratulations and that's the best part of it. You don't win that often so it's best to massage your ego when you do, and enjoy it.\" He felt that winning on Sunday was \"another step up the ladder\" to his ultimate ambition, to win one of the four championships. \"There's a big gap between this and a major,\" he said, \"but I'm getting there.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
