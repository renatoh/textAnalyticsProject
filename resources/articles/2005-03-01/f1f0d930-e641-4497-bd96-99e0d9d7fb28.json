I hope it lasts,\" says Gwendolen in The Importance of Being Earnest. White Nile would have been her sort of stock. Yesterday - a week and three days after trading in the shares of this speculative African venture were halted - the directors said they are still not ready to publish details of White Nile's oil deal in Sudan. Shenanigans with the stock exchange are said to be the cause. The new deadline is the end of this month. It could all be dismissed as entertaining sport were it not for the enormous claims being made behind the scenes. White Nile is apparently confident it has a provisional \u00a315m fundraising in place at 150p a share. If so, it will rival anything from the dotcom years. The directors, including former cricketer Phil Edmonds, invested at 0.1p just before Christmas; the first \u00a39m funding in February was at 10p; can 150p really be possible? We shall see. The circular threatens to be a stonker, running to 250 pages, of which a full 50 may be taken up with a geological survey. The optimists hope it will prove a few billion barrels of oil sit under White Nile's patch of Sudan. The key section, though, will be the one titled \"risk factors\". Total, the French oil giant, is telling the world it still has the oil rights to the land. White Nile reckons Total ceded them after the Sudanese coup d'etat of 1989. White Nile's pals are the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, soon to form the autonomous government of south Sudan. This former rebel group is likely to be given majority-ownership of White Nile as part of the exploration and production deal. They will be getting a slice of the most bizarre market tale in years. Let's hope it lasts. Money capital Much is being made of the New Statesman's cover story this week - the bling bling list - which supposedly illustrates how New Labour's resistance to taxing extreme wealth has encouraged an explosion of the super rich in Britain. The actual article, by John Kampfner, is rather thoughtful, concentrating on the tension between the government's moves to improve the lot of the very poor and its seeming determination to ignore calls for a new tax band on those who are earning in excess of \u00a3100,000. In fact, Kampfner's analysis has very little at all to do with the New Statesman list, which itself is an edited version of the annual Sunday Times rich list - taking the wealth of people like Bernie Ecclestone as reported in 1997 and seeing how much this has grown over the past seven years. Setting aside the obvious errors (Philip Green tops the list, when it is of course his wife Tina who owns Bhs and Arcadia), what is noticeable is how irrelevant Labour has been to the creation and maintenance of these new fortunes. What they reflect - from steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal to property dealer John Whittaker - is the availability of cheap finance, which has been used by canny individuals to build highly leveraged businesses at impressive speed. It is an international phenomenon, which feels noticeably British only because London is now the undisputed centre of the financial world. Warning light Private new car sales (ie non-fleet sales) collapsed by almost a quarter in February from a year earlier. In January they were down 21%. The wheels, we would guess, have suddenly come off this under-analysed sector. Car sales have never been a top-tier economic indicator because they are not seasonally adjusted and can be distorted by the twice-yearly registration change. But that does not mean the numbers are not telling us something important. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders tried to shrug off the bad data yesterday, saying that no one buys a car in February ahead of the March change in number plate. Maybe, but 23% fewer people bought a car ahead of this March than ahead of last March. That's why we look at year-on-year figures. And January's fall was nearly as bad. Indeed, both were the worst since the registration system changed back in 1999. For what it's worth, the SMMT predicts March sales will \"only\" be down 6% from a year earlier. Private car sales are interesting because they can be taken as a proxy for durable goods sales. They are also the biggest purchase most people make after their houses. They are not included in official retail sales figures but are part of overall consumption spending. The Bank of England has been warning for a while that it is growing increasingly concerned about the fragility of consumer spending. Most pundits have focused on data on retail sales and household spending, both of which have slowed sharply. But the Bank commented about cars in the minutes of both its January and February rate meetings, saying it suspected higher interest rates and weaker house prices were discouraging people from buying. If it is watching car sales so closely, perhaps we should follow suit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
