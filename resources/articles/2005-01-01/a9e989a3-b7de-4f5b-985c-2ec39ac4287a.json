After travelling for hours through plains covered only with thick Mozambican bush, the bridge is an intriguing possibility. I drive warily across - it's so narrow only one car at a time can pass. As soon as I set foot on Ilha de Mozambique, I realise the place has little to do with what could be expected from a tiny atoll of rocks and white sand set off Mozambique's remote northern coast. Far from being a simple paradise of beaches and palm trees, the island reveals itself as the most urban and sophisticated place in the region. The island used to be the capital of the Portuguese colony of Oriental Africa, and it was to mainland Mozambique what the brain is to its body, linked by a long spine in the form of a bridge. Walking around its streets is like visiting an open-air museum. Elegant examples of Portuguese colonial architecture - sun-warmed pink and ochre stucco town houses and churches - alternate with glimpses of turquoise sea. The remains of this fading world of empire jostle with traditional huts made of wattle and mud and the burgeoning tropical vegetation - palms, papayas and banyan trees. The town seems to live in a relaxed atmosphere, suspended between the splendour of ancient eras and the simple rhythms of village life. Most of the stone buildings have remained empty since the Portuguese left the country in 1975, and nature is now taking its revenge on cement and stones. Long exotic creepers climb up the walls and huge roots burst out of floors. I walk around the island looking for a place to stay. In 20 minutes I've crossed it from one end to the other without seeing another tourist. The list of guesthouses and hotels is certainly not long, but I am lucky. I find a charming room in a renovated Portuguese villa, called Patio dos Quintalinhos, set between an ancient mosque and a Christian orphanage. From outside you can't see much, but inside the place is stylishly decorated with a wooden fishing boat adapted as a sofa hanging from the living room ceiling, and a little swimming pool in the interior garden. The owner is an Italian architect called Gabriele, who moved to Ilha four years ago to work as a volunteer and is now busy restoring many of its ancient buildings. He's an expert on the island's architecture and he offers to take me on a tour. 'Have you ever heard of Latin Africa?' he asks me before going out. 'You'll see what I mean in a minute...' Gabriele and I while away the day in cafes where we are served strong espressos and delicious sweets made of crushed almonds mixed with sugar. A little after noon, we visit the teeming fish market and bargain for shrimps and crabs to give to the Patio cook to prepare for dinner. Cuisine here, like the language - still a Portuguese patois - and the music with its mixture of Brazilian and local rhythms, retain a Latin flavour unique in the region. After the cultural tour, I feel ready for a swim. Beaches around the island are busy with fishermen repairing their nets and selling their catch. For more solitude, Gabriele suggests that I take a dhow ride to Choqu - an idyllic beach back on the mainland. The only access is from the sea and, once there, the sole company I have on the miles of powdery white sand are hundreds of little crabs and shiny cowries. Later in the afternoon, I catch a ride from a fishing boat back to Ilha just in time to enjoy the sunset from the terrace of my guesthouse while sipping a cold 2M, the local beer. Gabriele is there, too, and we contemplate the view of the huge orange sun sinking into the sea to the melancholic notes of a muezzin calling for prayer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
