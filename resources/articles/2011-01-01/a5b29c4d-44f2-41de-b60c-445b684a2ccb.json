Five other ways to follow the action", "bodyText": "1 Watch it on television The easiest option, requiring only equipment, eyes and a comfortable chair. On ITV the game was introduced by Adrian Chiles with the words \"I just love this place. You can feel the hand of history on your shoulder\", or in cases of exiled broadsheet reporter intrusion, the hand of the chairman perhaps. The only real drawback was spending the entire 90 minutes listening to Peter Drury saying things like \"It's a cup tie with chemistry, Andy\", combined with an in-built inability to ask a nearby steward to have him removed. On the plus side the half-time queue for the loo is much shorter and there aren't generally threatening men inside smoking and shouting. Or if there are, it is at least acceptable to scream and call the police. Best bit: Gareth Southgate caught clearly yawning in the reflection in the studio window behind Gordon Strachan while his co-pundit attempted to say the word \"Nasri\". 2 Watch someone else watching it on television When a man is tired of Nigel Winterburn in a pair of headphones he is tired of, if not exactly life, then at least Sky Sports News on a match night. Men in suits talking about sport like it's a Middle Eastern war zone! Hypnotic scrolling info-tickers! And best of all an ex-Arsenal left-back watching television while you watch him on television telling you things about what he can see on television until someone finally says \"... And we'll be back with Nigel in just a minute.\" Best moment: a toss-up between Nigel saying \"it could be three four five nil but I'm not going to make that prediction\", some shaky footage of Buckie Thistle players fighting each other and the We Buy Any Car advert. 3 Nearly watch it on the internet The last recourse of the picture-craving Elland Road exile. The internet is, of course, awash with allegedly free allegedly live streaming feeds of allegedly top football matches. But somehow trying to get them to work is a bit like fighting your way through a thicket of cyber-bubblegum. First up: a dizzying jukebox of scrolling adverts with random phrases like \"Live!\" and \"English FA Cup!\" and \"Download now!\" scattered about like runic ciphers. Another live feed turned out to be a strangely absorbing set of coloured squares, like a Rothko painting of a Neapolitan ice cream. Another was entirely obscured by information about a \"shocking\" new teeth whitening treatment. The best picture quality offered an endlessly repeating TV commercial for the kingdom of Bahrain. No doubt, a nice kingdom. But not quite Elland Road. 4 Hear it on the radio The traditionalist's approach to enjoying football in absentia. Allow the wordsmiths of the airwaves to conjure the white heat of Elland Road in your kitchen, car or bathtub. \"No let up from Arsenal in their yellow shirts playing from left to right attacking the south stand where the Leeds supporters are sitting in those royal blue seats...\" Whoa there! Radio commentary does seem to have become a little more aggressive in its throat-clutching explanations of what exactly is going on out there, but it is still a joy on the BBC where the requirement to actually describe things seems to bring the best out of the languid, opinionated, non-joke-mode Mark Lawrenson. The closest thing to being there while not being there, if only perhaps for the wonderful howls and roars of the crowd, accompanied, for this listener at least, by similar howls and roars at the sudden appearance at the mic of Alan Green. 5 Read it on the internet A standard option for an exiled soul cast out from real life interaction and forced to moon from the sidelines. Happily, there is plenty of company here, not least in the form of the Guardian's own original minute-by-minute coverage, provided last night by internet football legend Paul Doyle. Plenty of instant wordsmithery: \"GOAL! Leeds 1-2 Arsenal (Johnson 37') A stonker, an absolute stonker! Johnson simply booked the ball into the top corner with his left foot from 29 yards.\" Live reader interaction (such as \"'Doesn't Arshavin's ironic smirk after giving the ball away resemble a man amused by his own decline and as a result the absurdity of life?' muses Ashkan Kalashy\"). Even better: it's free; and no one can ever tell you you're not allowed in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
