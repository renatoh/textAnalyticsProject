We'll be back in 20 minutes for the final session. Meanwhile this from Mark Pickering. \"I am enjoying the moving 'close' button on the Landrover pop up,\" says he says. \"It's doing a fine job of entertaining me whilst I work - I never know which corner it will appear in!\" There speaketh a man for the nation. Thanks for all your emails, and sorry I couldn't use them all, Sean. 13th over: England 51-1 (Trescothick 12, Butcher 14) Another change as Kallis comes on for Pollock. If anyone is going to swing it like Elvis's hips circa 1956 it'll be Kallis, but all his first over produces is a nice boundary for Butcher. \"Can you just tell Rory that slagging off Red Dwarf, Dungeons and Dragons etc is fine, but leave Buffy alone,\" says a firm-sounding Julian King. \"It is the finest exapmle of TV for a long time. He will have me and Brian Appleyard to anser too if he doesn't pipe down.\" Consider him told, Julian. 12th over: England 45-1 (Trescothick 12, Butcher 8) A change in the bowling as Andrew Hall replaces the Lisa Riley-diet loose Ntini. It's a good start too, accurate and steady, and earning a deserved maiden. \"I wondered if anybody else watched 'the real Geoffrey Boycott' last night,\" says Matt from Manchester. \"Was it only me that thought the image of Geoff Boycott as a 'Lothario' disturbing?\" 11th over: England 44-1 (Trescothick 12, Butcher 8) No signs of a David Hasselhoff-rough start for Butcher: two boundaroes off the over leaves England kicking on nicely. Meanwhile, over in email world, the IT/geek debate is continues apace. \"Has anyone considered that maybe if the authors and emailers of this page spent less time mocking techies' private habits, said techies might be more inclined to make sure that there aren't huge interruptions in coverage?\" says Steve Cross, a man who I'm guessing works in IT. 10th over: England 36-1 (Trescothick 12, Butcher 0) [Pause while over-by-over reporter, having had no lunch makes himself a protein shake. Ah, that's better]. Meanwhile, Trescothick clobbers two boundaries to move onto 12. \\3If you want to get into real geek speak, then surely you just have to go anti-Microsoft (bonus geek points for using $ instead of s) and mention that almost any browser other than Internet Explorer has a 'block pop-up facility',\" says Kenneth Yau. \"However, I think the techie geeks who programmed the Land Rover ad have done something clever to bypass the blockers anyway. So that was a waste of valuable working time, wasn't it?\" Indeed it was Kenneth. 9th over: WICKET! Vaughan c Gibbs b Pollock 23 (South Africa 28-1) Now the screams are coming from the South Africans! Vaughan, who's looked masterly this afternoon, can't resisting pushing at one and Gibbs and second slip scoops the catch. That's Pollocks 300th Test wicket and he's rightly delighted. Meanwhile the rest of us... \"I have never met Laura Dance,\" says Anton Lawrence. \"Am I the only one, or are there more?\" No, don't worry, Anton. You're not alone. 8th over: England 23-0 (Trescothick 4, Vaughan 18) Listen to that boozy, mid-afternoon roar! Ntini drops one short and wide and Trescothick pounces like a hungry panther, looping a vicious cut shot over gully for a boundary. Which means that, finally, after 30 minutes and 23 balls, he's finally off the mark. \"Before anyone starts ranting at the recordingly-challenged Green, could I just point out that there have been four Scritti Politti albums which, while still averaging out at one every six and a quarter years, is more productive than the combined work output of GU readers during a test series,\" says Alistair Moffat 7th over: England 19-0 (Trescothick 0, Vaughan 18) Steady this from England: Vaughan is happy to block the straight ones and cut loose when anything strays - and so far it's doing him well. \"Re: puzzled Christopher Greenwell. Didn\u00b9t Botham and Tuffers both hit the hash pipe at some stage in their England careers?\" says Andrew Whittaker, who may or may not be related to Hollywood star Forrest. \"And what about that scandal involving Derek Randall and Pamela Anderson? Uncanny parallels with a Motley Crue biog surely.\" Hmmm. 6th over: England 16-0 (Trescothick 0, Vaughan 15) Better over from Ntini that, but still no real pace, discernable swing or length. He's bowling too wide outside off-stump and Trescothick is content to watch. Meanwhile, a special Laura Dance section \"laura dance was indeed at college with me. i was indeed a scientist. i am now, however, in the field of 'science communication', hence the clarity of my first email. hello laura, by the way. how are you\" -- Henry Scowcroft (a man who clearly feels capital letters are beneath him). \"i was at college with laura dance (over 127) and can confirm that rather than knowing anything about being watching cricket lazily in the afternoon sun, she got up early and rowed silly long canoes for \"fun\". her input is unwarranted. Sean Morley (a man who clearly feels capital letters are beneath him). 5th over: England 14-0 (Trescothick 0, Vaughan 14) Now it's Vaughan's turn to face Pollock. And, in truth, it's not the most confident of performances: first he chases one down leg, a la David Gower, and nearly gets a flick to Boucher - and, two balls later, only just makes it to his crease after scampering for a quick single. \"Can we get Wayne 'I've-just-polished-off-another-pack-of-cheesy-wotsits' Stubbs to pipe down?\" says Rory Batho (and lots of others). \"Dungeons and Dragons less nerdy than Cricket?! Hogwash. If he doesn't like it, there must surely be an episode of Buffy or Red Dwarf on the Sci-fi channel he can watch instead?\" 4th over: England 14-0 (Trescothick 0, Vaughan 13) Vaughan's already in the groove, guiding another Tony Hadley-smooth drive through the covers. The shuffling Trescothick is yet to get off the mark, however. Number of people complaining about the Land Rover pop-up ads=17. It's not for me to say, of course (more than my job's worth etc., etc.) but doesn't Google have a toolbar that can zap them? 3rd over: England 9-0 (Trescothick 0, Vaughan 8) Another solid over from Pollock. Trescothick, who's had a poor summer, is rightly watchful. \"Dungeons and Dragons could only be defended by someone called Wayne,\" says Tom Adam. \"Beyond satire.\" 2nd over: England 9-0 (Trescothick 0, Vaughan 8) Two exquisite cover drives from Michael Vaughan has the Oval crowd cheering boozily - and it was nearly three: only a brilliant stop from Graeme Smith, standing at mid-on, prevented Vaughan going onto double figures. Meanwhile anger is still the theme of your emails. \"How can you compare anything in English cricket to Motley Crue?\" asks a puzzled Christopher Greenwell. \"David Gower buzzing an Australian cricket ground in a light aircraft wouldn't even make it to a footnote in the Motley Crue book.\" First over: England 0-0 (Trescothick 0, Vaughan 0) Most experts reckon this Oval pitch is still a belter and England should make a hatful on it. It doesn't quite look that way at the moment: Pollock is as tight as a Mod's trousers in his first over, and Trescothick can do nothing but block and watch. To your emails! \"I will add to the queue of no-doubt seething over-by-over'ers by saying that St James' Park is in London (nr Home Office), not Newcastle - you are obviously a North London Grauniad journo with too much Fiver on the brain,\" says the astute Stefan Webb. Sorry, again, everyone: the lack of capital letters threw me. INTERMISSION We'll be back in 10 minutes for England's innings/collapse. In the meantime, the nerds are striking back. \"I suppose you think cricket is superior to Dungeons and Dragons?\" says a braying Wayne Stubbs. \"After all, one consists of sad individuals living out their fantasies for long hours in the company of other nerds, reciting arcane jargon and recording strange statistics on a grubby piece of paper. And the other is Dungeons and Dragons.\" Mmm. WICKET! England strike Ntini b Anderson 11 After being sliced over slip for a boundary, Anderson comes back with fire in his belly (note to worried readers: not literally). After tricking Ntini this way and that, he hurls one through his gate to leave South Africa all out for 484 off 128 overs. \"Not that you're worried about the competition or anything but Alex Sharrat over on Sky has just warned 'South Africa are edging closer to my 504 all out prediction. If I'm right, I'll explode,' says James Wilson. \"We live in hope.\" Indeed we do, Jamie. 127th over: South Africa 480-9 (Pollock 66, Ntini 7) A quiet maiden, which at least leaves Ntini facing Anderson in the next over. Meanwhile thanks to everyone who's pointed out that Run and Become (the shop Shaun Pollock was buying his shoes from) is - to quote Daniel Sladen \"a sports shoe shop on Palmer Street between St James's Park tube and Victoria\" and not, as I assumed, somewhere in Newcastle. \"I was at college with [Shaun-Pollock spotter] Henry Scowcroft,\" says Laura Dance. \"I have a vague idea he was a scientist hence, probably, the lack of capital letters that would have made it all clear. Nice chap though.\" 126th over: South Africa 480-9 (Pollock 66, Ntini 7) A change in the bowling as James Anderson, sans streaky-bacon coloured highlights, comes into the attack. One delivery nearly cuts Ntini at half but apart from that South Africa look mighty confident. This partnership is now 48. \"Could we find out if Owen Gartside is any relation to Green Gartside, singer with 80s band 'Scritti Politti?\" asks Chris Lancaster. \"If so, could he ask Green if three albums is really an appopriate level of output for 25 years work? If he slacked any more, he could be a Guardian journalist.\" 125th over: South Africa 478-9 Oh dear, this is looking horribly familiar. Having steadily tightened the screw to leave South Africa at 432-9 at lunch, England have got their powertools out and completely loosened it. They haven't even had a sniff of a wicket in the last 40 minutes. Meanwhile can anyone make sense of this? \"Saw Shaun Pollock in run and become in St James' Park on Monday,\" says Henry Scowcroft. \"He was buying new trainers. He is very tall. Glad you're back.\" 124th over: South Africa 464-9 (Pollock 52, Ntini 7) What a way for Shaun Pollock to bring up his 50! Rightly anticipating that Giles' twirlers are twirling even less than usual he charges down the pitch and blugeons him over long off for a six. \"Gareth Boardman is almost right,\" says Owen Gartside. \"Mogwais are nice until they eat after midnight, then they turn into Gremlins. So Gremlins are always nasty, no matter what time of day they eat. And, by the way, I'm still not interested in buying a Land Rover.\" 123rd over: South Africa 456-9 (Pollock 44, Ntini 7) A reprise of the last over as Pollock takes a single off the fourth ball to leave Ntini facing Harmison. An expectant murmur drifts around the Oval. But not only is Ntini unfazed, he clonks the Durham paceman for a confident couple of runs. Just read the idea of the desktop scorecard. What's the point? Loads of people already do them,\" says Chris Marshall. \"What would be better is a desktop card that tells you when there's something entertaining to read in the commentary.\" You'd be waiting a while, Chris. 122nd over: South Africa 453-9 (Pollock 43, Ntini 5) The wiles of Giles return. After Pollock nibbles a single off the fourth delivery of the over, the England fielders crowd expectantly around Ntini looking for a bat-pad. Sadly, Giles is wayward and the South Africans survive. Meanwhile this from Ed Auger. \"Yesterday was horrific,\" he says, tongue surprisingly not in cheek. \"Not only because you weren't around but because as a result of your absence I had to rely on the truly abysmal imitation of your good self on Sky Sports for my cricket updates.\" 121st over: South Africa 453-9 (Pollock 42, Ntini 5) In that over Harmison is more wild than cock-rockers Motley Crue in their 80s prime. Result? Pollock smashes a boundary and the South Africans go past the 450 mark. Pedants corner: \"Don't you numbnuts' know anything? Gremlins only get nasty when you feed them after midnight,\" says Gareth Boardman. \"They reproduce when you cover em in water!\" 120th over: South Africa 448-9 (Pollock 37, Ntini 5) More runs from Pollock, as South Africa sneak towards 450. Meanwhile the abuse continues to clunk in. \"It appears that Fiveritis (ie. doing sod all) has spread to the cricket coverage,\" chirps Emer Callery, who is certainly full of beans today. Good day to you too, Emer. 119th over: South Africa 443-9 (Pollock 36, Ntini 1) Harmison, all menace and wayward spite, charges in. But Ntini survives - for now at least. He is getting an extra-sized arm guard, though, which seems wise. \"Erm is it the site working?\" asks a bemused James Lewindon. \"Correct me if I am wrong but weren't gremlins only nasty when they were sprayed with water?\" True, James, true. But you're forgetting that when our techie team start playing the latest Dungeons and Dragons game the drool they produce is enough to supply a small African state. Hence the gremlins. 118th over: South Africa 441-9 Flintoff grimaces, and with good reason. Pollock swings and gets a meaty edge which sails between wicket-keeper and second slip. Still, at least it means Ntini will be taking strike. Incidentally, the number of ranting emails received this morning = 289. Number of people now demanding a desktop scoreboard = 77. Sorry, we'll do our best, but one step at a time, eh? 117th over: South Africa 434-9 We're back, promise (and apologies once again for the jazz riffery of the last couple of days). Ashley Giles, bowls the first over after lunch and, as usual, doesn't get much turn. A sedate couple of runs later the players are changing ends. So, what did you miss? Day one reprise: Having inflicted the sort of pain that'd make even Jamie Theakston's Soho Dungeoness blanche yesterday, South Africa are hoping to make England suffer again today. They start on 362-4 - what price it's 550 all out by stumps tonight? Apologies for technical problems yesterday: We had \"a critical failure of the NFS server\" at 9.30am yesterday morning and it threw everything into chaos. Sorry. Apologies for technical problems today: Apparently it's something to do with [over-by-over report dons anorak] GNL's ISP connections. Sorry again. Rants, abuse etc,. etc: \"You owe us big time. Had to spend all day yesterday working, so today you need to be twice as entertaining as usual,\" says Richard Butler, who may or not be the former UN weapons inspector. \"Watching it on cricinfo is not fun.\" \"Thanks to your gubbins technology yesterday I had to follow the score on the BBC - frankly their coverage is useless,\" says Freddie Mills. \"Sort it out today please.\" \"You awake yet?\" - Ross Brown. \"It's nearly 11 and I still can't get any commentary on your site,\" asks Matt Amer. \"Has it all gone horribly wrong again and am I actually going to have to do some work two days running?\" \"Rubbish.\" Jonathan Pughe. \"Anybody know whats happening in the cricket? Somebody should start a service that gives you live written commentary direct to your desk, so you can keep up to date at work. That'd be magic!\" Joshua Hardie. \"So what did you boys do on what effectively was a paid day off then?\" asks Colin Gerrard. \"Productive five minutes finishing the Fiver, then an afternoon in the pub (or vice versa)?\" Au contraire, Colin. We worked till we dropped (as always.) Hurrah! Our crack team of techies have discarded their 19-sided dice and sorted out the problems. So, what have you missed? WICKET! In the second over of the day, Martin Bicknell gets one to nip back, leaving Jacques Rudolph trapped lbw for 0, leaving South Africa on 365-5. WICKET! Bicknell strikes again, swinging one away from Boucher, who gets an edge and is caught behind for 8. South Africa are now 385-6. WICKET! Shaun Pollock smashes Ashley Giles straight down the wicket, Giles tips it onto the stumps and Jacques Kallis is run out for 66, leaving South Africa 419-7 WICKET! Fatty Flintoff strikes, trapping Andrew Hall lbw for 1, leaving South Africa on 421-8. WICKET! Another run-out! Paul Adams goes for one after a brilliant piece of fielding by Mark Butcher, to leave South Africa on 432-9 at lunch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
