Romero was signed as a free agent in July, with Van Gaal having managed the Argentinian at AZ Alkmaar. David de Gea has been dropped while he is a target for Real Madrid and, while the Spaniard\u2019s future remains unclear, Romero is the No1 and has kept four clean sheets in United\u2019s five games, with the defence conceding only one goal. Van Gaal said about his goalkeeper: \u201cUntil now we don\u2019t allow a lot of shots. I think only maybe the save against Brugge at 1-0 was very important. He did also a save at Tottenham. He could not show what he can do but that\u2019s only a compliment for the team.\u201d Romero\u2019s fine displays came despite joining United\u2019s summer tour late. Yet the manner in which the 27-year-old has slotted in was expected by Van Gaal. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised we are doing well with him because the defence starts with the striker and we have proved also last season that we have a good defence.\u201d In Wednesday\u2019s 4-0 win at Club Brugge in the Champions League play-off second leg Javier Hern\u00e1ndez missed a late penalty and Van Gaal was annoyed. He said the Mexican should be able to handle the demands of playing for the club. \u201cEvery player who plays for Manchester United has to cope with that pressure.\u201d Wayne Rooney, who scored a hat-trick in the victory over Brugge, handed the ball to Hern\u00e1ndez for him to take the spot-kick. Van Gaal welcomed the gesture, though he would have felt different if the game had been goalless. \u201cNot surprised because he is a very social guy, a real captain, but he cannot do it when it\u2019s 0-0, then I\u2019m very angry, but at 4-0 I think it was a great gesture.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
