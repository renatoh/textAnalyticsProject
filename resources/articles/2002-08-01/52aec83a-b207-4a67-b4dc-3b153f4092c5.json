To their right, a DJ creates a vibrant hip-hop soundtrack, showing off impressive scratching and beatbox skills. The audience is full of teens and twentysomethings, whooping, laughing and waving their arms. This could be a gig or a club. In fact, it's a theatre in Edinburgh, and just another performance of The Bomb-itty of Errors. This boisterous, invigorating production is the Holy Grail that theatres across Britain endlessly seek: a hit among young audiences. Nearly every performance during the play's run at the Pleasance Over the Road, one of the larger Edinburgh fringe venues, sold out. And it was not just kids whose imaginations were caught by the piece. Britain's theatre critics praised its \"gleeful exuberance\" and \"lively subversiveness\"; even the Telegraph, not generally known as an arbiter of cool, felt that it \"pulses with wit, savvy and a sublime sense of its own ridiculousness\". Film and theatre director Julie Taymor, who saw the show in an earlier incarnation in New York, caught the mood when she wrote in Vogue magazine: \"If the Bard were alive today, he might well be a rapper... Bomb-itty is rap at its best, theatre at its most compelling.\" This is all the more remarkable considering the play's premise. Most people would run a mile from a production that, in the US, was billed as \"an 'ad-rap-tation' of Willy Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors\". In the wrong hands, an attempt to mould Shakespeare's comedy of mistaken identities to the rhythms of hip-hop would be disastrous - as embarrassing as a teacher wearing a baseball cap backwards and bigging up Shake to the Speare. But Bomb-itty instantly dispels any doubts: partly because of its infectious sense of humour, partly because of its ingenious use of Shakespeare's text (some lines are rapped intact), mostly because it is performed with jaw-dropping speed and energy by its classically trained cast. In Shakespeare's original, Antipholus of Ephesus and his servant Dromio are thrown into confusion when, unknown to each other, their twin brothers of the same names arrive in town from Syracuse. In Bomb-itty, the Antipholus and Dromio twins are now quadruplets, put up for adoption after their father, a famous MC, committed suicide. Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus visit Syracuse, New York, to take part in an MC competition. In the ensuing mayhem, one Antipholus is called home to a wife he never married, only to fall in love with her sister. Meanwhile, the other Antipholus runs foul of a policeman who enjoys a worrying relationship with his horse. Four actors play 16 characters, including a Jewish jeweller with a line in astonishingly elaborate mama insults, a wannabe MC with an agonising inability to rhyme and a Rastafarian quack doctor who blithely dispenses elephant urine. The most amusing characters are those that require the actors to don drag: Charles Anthony Burks's princessy prostitute is a treat, but the show is stolen by Chris Edwards's deliciously ditsy Luciana, who cannot remember the words to a love song whose chorus simply repeats her own name. Some of the characters are stereotypes, and there is a tendency to lapse into playground humour, but there is no doubting the intelligence with which this show has been put together. Bomb-itty started life as a university project, written and performed by four final-year students at New York's Tisch School of the Arts: Gregory Qaiyam, Erik Weiner, Jason Catalano and Jordan Allen-Dutton. Qaiyam's DJ brother Jeffrey arranged all the music. They gave six performances in 1998, and received so much support that they returned to New York the following year for a seven-month run, which in turn led to a lengthy Chicago run. Despite first appearances, Bomb-itty adheres closely to Shakespeare's play. Most of the original characters are present in some guise or another, and many of the sentiments are the same, even if the language is resoundingly modern. When Antipholus of Ephesus is puzzled at his unexpected popularity in Syracuse, for instance, he remarks: \"Everywhere I go, people giving me skin/ They saying 'Whassup?' and they calling me friend.\" Later, when the same Antipholus attempts to woo his sister-in-law (unaware of her identity, naturally), he quotes from Shakespeare verbatim. \"Shakespeare is a gift for rappers,\" says Andy Goldberg, who directed the New York, Chicago and Edinburgh productions. \"There are so many rhyming couplets, which lends itself to rap, and so much punning and wordplay, which are the same tools that hip-hop uses.\" Although Shakespeareans have been pleasantly surprised by the play, it hasn't been received with universal approval. Some American audiences have objected to the portrayal of Hasidic Jews and gays, to the point of storming out of the theatre. Others have questioned whether it is right for middle-class white men (as the creators were) to appropriate black culture in this way. \"Since the cast became more multi-ethnic, people have concentrated more on the storytelling,\" says Burks, a black actor who understudied in New York and began performing Bomb-itty in his own right in Chicago. And it is that storytelling, he thinks, that makes the piece admirable to hip-hop purists who might otherwise dismiss its feel-good, Cypress Hill-style sounds as too accessible. As for accusations of anti-semitism or homophobia: \"We offend everybody,\" he says cheerily, \"but in a way that's fun. And if you read Shakespeare on sex, homoeroticism, race, he's worse than we ever are.\" Perhaps that's why Shakespeare has proved so ripe for ad-rap-tation in the past. Before they found fame with the Fugees, Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean performed in Club XII, a hip-hop musical based on Twelfth Night. Earlier this year audiences in San Francisco were treated to MacB, a hip-hop version of Macbeth in which the witches were an R&amp;B girl group and the Thane of Glamis a record-industry mogul looking to beat his competitors. Over on the east coast, audiences at New York's third annual hip-hop theatre festival could attend performances under the banner Rapping the Bard. In Britain, meanwhile, audiences at the Queen Elizabeth Hall have seen Rennie Harris's Rome and Jewels, an all-male, street-dancing Romeo and Juliet. This is all part of a wider movement that seeks to shatter the image of theatre as the province of the white middle classes. Hip-hop theatre aims to bring more black stories to the stage, and entice people, especially the young, away from the cinema and TV. In some respects, Bomb-itty is typical of the genre's development to date: its characters are MCs, they are absorbed in the rap world. The next step, says Burks, himself a writer, is to \"create hip-hop theatre with stories that aren't stereotypically black\". Having created one of the most popular pieces of hip-hop theatre to date, Bomb-itty's creators are now recording a comedy sketch show for MTV. But their ambition for the play - for it to run in multiple cities in multiple countries - is slowly being fulfilled. This year has already seen three different casts performing Bomb-itty in Chicago, Florida and at the Edinburgh festival. Now there are plans for a London transfer. When the group does return to the theatre, says Goldberg, it probably won't be with more Shakespeare. \"We're going to go through the canon one by one,\" he says. \"What about a hip-hop Dickens?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
