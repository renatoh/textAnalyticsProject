The fiasco, revealed after First Group won the contract to run the line instead of Virgin Trains, could end up costing the government up to \u00a3100m, while the financial audit would not have cost more than \u00a31m. Patrick McLoughlin, the minister of transport, will give a statement to the House of Commons this week on an investigation into the bid and the arrangements for management of the line when Virgin's contract runs out in December. The government has asked Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, who also sits on the board of the DfT, to carry out an inquiry. Critics point out that Laidlaw's inquiry cannot be independent if he's a board member. Civil servants and ministers say that it was normal practice to employ financial auditors, such as PwC, to check the calculations and methods used by civil servants in awarding contracts. An independent audit is also a useful way of deflecting charges or accusations of incompetence or bias. A spokesman for the DfT refused to confirm while Laidlaw was carrying out his inquiry that a financial audit was not carried out on the bid. McLoughlin described \"serious errors\" in the bidding process carried out under Justine Greening, who is now minister for international development but was then transport secretary. The initial cost of the suspension of the franchise is estimated to be \u00a340m but three other franchise bids have also been suspended, which will incur further costs. Stephen Joseph of the Campaign for Better Transport said he had also been told that the absence of an external financial audit was a factor. \"What we have heard is that the government completely changed the nature of the franchise, cut the number of civil servants by one third and then would not allow them to employ external auditors. None of this has been passenger-focused, it has all been about the bottom line,\" he said. The civil servants' error was in producing spreadsheets that mixed up real and inflated figures and included double accounting. A financial audit would have uncovered mistakes and could have saved the government from the massive costs it now faces. Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said the government's rush to cut spending was instrumental in the franchise failure. \"It will add insult to injury if \u00a340m and rising of taxpayers' money has gone down the drain because of shortsighted shortcuts made by ministers, designed to save money but ending up costing vastly more,\" she said. Three members of the Professional and Commercial Services Union, who have been suspended by the DfT for their role, are understood to be furious that they have been made scapegoats for ministerial mistakes. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: \"Having cut resources to the bone, in the name of austerity, ministers have shamefully sought to blame civil servants.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
