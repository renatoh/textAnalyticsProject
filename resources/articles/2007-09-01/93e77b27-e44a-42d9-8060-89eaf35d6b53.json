Such was the uncertainty over Flintoff's participation in the tournament that his place in the squad was not confirmed until Saturday evening after medical staff had examined his left ankle and found no swelling following England's series-clinching seven-wicket win. Although the management are hopeful he will be fit for England's Twenty20 opener against Zimbabwe in Cape Town on Thursday, they know definitive statements are pointless: their prize all-rounder now inhabits a world in which doubt is the lingua franca. \"It's a very good sign that the ankle didn't swell up,\" said Peter Moores. \"But it still felt a little bit strange and unstable. So the plan is to take him to the Twenty20 and keep managing him through that. The key thing is that we're not doing damage to Fred's ankle. The surgeon and the medical team looked at it and they're quite confident because there's no swelling. We've got to make sure it feels right to play with because for Fred that's quite important.\" Flintoff's value as the bowling attack's first-change enforcer was underlined once more at Lord's. He removed Rahul Dravid in his second over and, fortuitously, Sachin Tendulkar in his third en route to figures of three for 45. And if Dravid's assessment that Flintoff is \"half their side\" was a little harsh on the rest then Paul Collingwood's claim that he is \"two players in one\" was closer to the mark. But even the hymns of praise are tinged with regret. Speculation over his possible participation in the five-match one-day series in Sri Lanka starting on October 1 remains and Moores admitted that part of Flintoff's challenge over the coming weeks and months will be to readjust mentally to the constraints placed on him by an ankle that has already undergone three operations. \"It's frustrating for him that he can't just go out and play, and he's coming to terms with that,\" said the England coach. \"He just wants to go out and play and bowl at 90mph and bat the way he bats. I think realistically he's going to have to work with what he's got. We've just got to manage it. There's no other way around it. We're hoping it gets easier because he gets used to it and the medical team find the right strapping, the right brace, or whatever, to make him able to play.\" England's chairman of selectors David Graveney yesterday confirmed Flintoff had been looking at changing his bowling action. \"People have looked at his front foot position to see if that has any affect on his ankle, to take the pressure of it slightly,\" he told Five Live's Sportsweek. \"It will be gently over a period of time - it is not going to happen in a matter of days. Again, I am sure Freddie will be working with Allan Donald to effect that change.\" Barring an unlikely defeat to Zimbabwe, England are scheduled to play five group games in seven days but since no bowler can send down more than four overs a match, the hope is Flintoff can muddle through. \"One thing Fred's got in his favour is that he doesn't need to practise a lot to keep his consistency,\" said Moores, who also pointed out that the player's left ankle was not rotating as much at Lord's on the point of delivery as it has done in the past. Even if Flintoff does break down, however, England will not be short of all-rounders. Dimitri Mascarenhas was confirmed as a replacement in the 15-man squad for the left-arm seamer Ryan Sidebottom, who remains short of match fitness following a side injury, and will enter the tournament with expectations high after smashing five successive sixes at The Oval last week and taking three for 23 from 10 overs on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
