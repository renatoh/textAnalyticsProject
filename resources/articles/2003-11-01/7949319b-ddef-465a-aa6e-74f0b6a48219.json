On average, we will spend \u00a3345.65 each on presents, \u00a3114.72 on food and \u00a363.85 on drink, and the rest on Christmas cards, accessories and decorations. But despite planning a shopping binge, one in five people fail to budget for the festive season. People in Scotland are planning to be the biggest spenders, shelling out an average of \u00a31040 each, \u00a3413.80 of which will go on presents. Those in the Midlands expect to spend the least, at still generous \u00a3819.40. Almost a quarter of people are planning to do some of their Christmas shopping overseas, and 57% of those will be crossing the channel to stock up on booze in France. The internet has yet to catch up with the high street, with only 3% of people saying it would be their main way of doing their Christmas shopping. Almost a quarter of those who said they were not planning to buy online said they would never do so in the future, and nearly half said they were unlikely to. Over two thirds of people said they would dip into their savings to fund Christmas spending, while just 9% said they would be relying on credit cards or loans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
