Signalling that the world now faced a \"time of adversity\", the chancellor opened the door to tax rises when he signalled his determination to press ahead with increased spending regardless of the state of the economy. Tony Blair had underlined the changed economic mood on Sunday when he indicated that the government might have to relax its tough rules on borrowing. But the chancellor went further in his speech to the Labour conference yesterday when he talked of \"building public support for the Budget and spending decisions\" - code for possible tax rises. Winning such support would allow him to \"release further new resources for tackling poverty and for public services\" when he unveils his next spending round in July. Mr Brown also called for global cooperation in tackling terrorists' access to finance. He disclosed that Britain has already frozen \u00a361m in bank accounts linked to Afghanistan's Taliban government. Mr Brown said: \"Ready access to finance is the lifeblood of modern terrorism. And no institution, no bank, no finance house anywhere in the world should be harbouring or processing funds for terrorists.\" A Treasury source indicated that the chancellor would stand by Labour's manifesto commitment not to raise the higher and basic rates of income tax. There would also be no extension of the scope of VAT. However, the source held out the possibility of an increase in national insurance payments. \"We gave no commitment in this area during the election,\" the source said. Excise duties could also be increased. Michael Howard, the new shadow chancellor, rounded on Mr Brown last night, claiming that he was using the bombings as an excuse for tax rises that were in the pipeline already. \"At a time of national crisis the chancellor should tell the British people the truth and acknowledge that the storm clouds were gathering before September 11,\" Mr Howard said. The Tories claimed during the election that taxes or borrowing would have to rise to pay for Labour's spending plans. They argued that current plans were unsustainable because of the gap between public spending increases, at just under 4%, and trend growth rate at just over 2%. The chancellor's signals on taxes came during a sombre speech that was dominated by the fallout from the American bombings. \"This is no ordinary time, no ordinary conference,\" Mr Brown said. \"September 11 transformed our times and our task. Let us be in no doubt: it has fallen to our generation to bear the burden of defeating international terrorism.\" Mr Brown, who made a point of not attacking the Tories, said that the fallout from the bombings underlined the importance of his brand of progressive politics. In a tribute to the New York firefighters, the chancellor described them as \"quietheroes\" who demonstrated a \"common humanity expressed through public services\". The international coalition to tackle global terrorism should also be joined by \"a humanitarian coalition to tackle the evil of global poverty\", Mr Brown said, adding: \"We have always held true to the high ideals of freedom, social justice and oppor tunity for all. We remember the generation that even in Britain's darkest hour never lost sight of its commitment to social progress.\" Amid his sombre language, the chancellor insisted that Britain was better placed to weather the global downturn than it was in the early 1990s when interest rates, inflation and unemployment were all high. In a reference to the Wilson and Callaghan governments, Mr Brown said: \"Our spending plans are affordable precisely because we have not made the mistakes of the last two Labour governments who, by refusing to take early action to maintain stability, ended up cutting public spending.\" The Treasury source made clear that the chancellor had a \u00a39bn \"cushion in the public finances\" because of the sur plus he has built up over the past four years. Such strong public finances allowed for \"the automatic stabilisers\" to kick in during a downturn. \"If growth is slower than forecast, taxes will be down, spending will increase and so borrowing will be higher,\" the source said. \"But if growth is down we expect it to be higher after a few years, meaning taxes will be up and borrowing will be down.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
