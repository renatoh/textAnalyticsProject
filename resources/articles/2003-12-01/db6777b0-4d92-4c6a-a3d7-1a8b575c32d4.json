Even sitting still, she seems to be arriving at 20km a second, a bright spark across the winter skies. This is handy if you are about to become a television lecturer, and bang on if the big things in your scientific life are lumps of rock from Mars that landed on Earth with a bump. Dr Grady, 45, head of meteoritics and petrology at London's Natural History Museum, is about to become a star and then - metaphorically again - move to another planet. She is this year's Royal Institution Christmas lecturer, the latest in a 180-year-old tradition, and later this month, she will appear over five days on Channel 4, taking a studio audience of 200 schoolchildren on a voyage through space and time. She will start with the Big Bang 13bn years ago and explain the stars and galaxies, the making of a solar system from a gazillion bits of rock and dust whizzing about in space, and then explore the planets, especially Mars. Which is also spot on: by the last episode, with luck, a British team will have a lander on Mars, and will have begun a search for evidence of bygone life with an instrument built by Grady's husband, Ian Wright of the Open University. Life for the Grady bunch has been Mars-obsessed lately: her professional preoccupation has been to build up a picture of the carbon cycle on the red planet from a study of bits of Martian meteorite. Her husband's has been to get there and to find out whether any of that carbon may have passed through some living thing, billions of years before. The high point will be on December 29 with - cross your fingers - an image beamed back from the camera on the Martian lander Beagle 2. \"The bottom-line message that I hope people take home [from the lectures] is that it is not finished, that although we have been doing this research for a long time, it is not done and dusted by any stretch of the imagination. We have barely scratched the surface, there is so much more that we need to understand, there are so many unanswered questions and you - the 14, 15, 16 year-olds - you are the generation who are going to carry on with this, you are perhaps the first generation to return to the moon, you are going to be the first generation of space travellers,\" she says. \"That is what I want to get across. We are at the brink now. We are just starting to develop the technologies to reach out into space and it is going to be the next generation to take that through: the next generation of telescopes, the next generation of astronauts, the next generation of travellers. That is what I want them to feel: that there is so much still to do, and that we need them to do it.\" The Royal Institution lectures were always a star turn. When Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday spoke, society listened. Albemarle Street, the base for the institution, was so jammed with carriages that it became the city's first one-way street. Grady was surprised to get the role. The train broke down at Watford Junction on the way to her audition, and she was half an hour late when she ran up Albemarle Street; it was also raining, so she looked like a drowned rat, clutching a soggy poster and carrying a Lego Mars rover made by her son Jack, now 13, which came to bits in her bag. Even so, she made an impact. \"I arrived all to pieces figuratively, and gave the lecture and they obviously reckoned that I could keep my head in a crisis so I was appointed to do it for this year,\" she says with Yorkshire intonations from a childhood in Leeds. Grady always wanted to be a scientist. She did chemistry at the University of Durham and, brought up on the limestone and millstone grit of the Dales, combined it with geology. She went on to a PhD at Cambridge, where her supervisor Colin Pillinger - now chief architect of Beagle 2 - suggested a closer look at moon rocks and meteorites. The project combined chemistry and geology, astronomy and planetary science. \"It was ideal.\" Women are a minority in science. It is a world of men of a certain age. \"Yes, with a beard , probably glasses and a pocketful of Biros,\" she agrees. But she never had any problems. \"Never. Others have. I have been lucky in that I have always done what I wanted to do and I have had the support of my peers and the support of my immediate bosses and most importantly the support of my husband, because I couldn't have done all these things without being able to share the child's care. But without knowing that I could rely on Ian, and he could rely on me, it would have been difficult.\" She can think small: a millionth-of- a-metre small because she is interested in tiny grains of silicate, which are about a micron in diameter. This is space dust: 40,000 tonnes of it lands on Earth each year. She can think bite-sized: of the 30,000 or so meteorites or lumps of stony, stony-iron or carbonaceous chondrite that hit Earth each year. Most are bits of asteroid. More than a dozen are known to have been chipped off the moon. Twelve so far have been identified as bits of shrapnel from Mars, hurled into space by some ancient cosmic collision, that wandered into an orbit round the Sun and eventually hit the Earth. She can think big, because these fragments tell a planet-sized story. They are pointers on a journey back to Mars. Robots have already been there, three more will land in the next few weeks. Humans alive now could one day walk on Mars. \"One of the things I am going to talk about is what we would do if we landed on Mars, what we would do if we wanted to make Mars a habitation. The first thing is to do something about the atmosphere: how would you build up the atmosphere, what sort of plants would you grow? Would you start with major terraforming, straight away, dragging in bits of comet to melt and put carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? Or would you start small and have a whole series of biodomes? In the biodomes you'd have to start small with bacteria, lichen, and start building up and then go on to higher things, slipping oxygen in to the atmosphere all the time. Then go on to grasses perhaps, because there are no insects to pollinate so you need something _ Cacti with long roots might be able to tap into any underground ice reservoir,\" she says. She will be talking to a generation alive to the violence being done to Earth, to its atmosphere, its ozone layer, its biodiversity. So then she puts the big question: never mind the expense or the technology, should you do such things to an innocent planet? \"I don't think we should. No, it is a planet that we don't understand and it maybe has its own ecology, we don't know. Even if it's found to be truly dead - and that there is nothing there - I still don't think we have the right to take over something else. Notwith standing the rightness and wrongness of it, it probably wouldn't work. Why should Mars keep an artificial atmosphere when it lost its own natural one? We don't think that the Martian atmosphere was removed by any unusual mechanism. It wasn't stripped away during some giant impact, as far as we are aware. So if Mars lost an atmosphere once, it can lose it again, and again and again. It won't grip its atmosphere, it is too small. So I think we might be on to a bit of a loser.\" Her moments of greatest joy in science are when she opens a white envelope from the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council that says her grant proposal has been funded. \"Sometimes it has made me cry with happiness. Yes! It is not something that happens that often. We spend a lot of time and energy thinking of projects that we want to do. I want to do this research, I really, really want to do this research and I write the best proposal that I can, and it can only be six pages long, with all the really trenchant reasons for doing this, for doing it now, this is why it is important, this is why it is significant, this is what the scientific community, the nation, the world will get out of it and you send it in and it is like sending your newborn through the post. And two months later a little note comes back which says 'unfundable'! It has gone to your peers - and your peers have said it's crap! It's just so awful.\" The money is so she can fund her post-docs in their own meteoric careers. This is St Monica, she says, training the next generation. She claims never to have had any eureka moments, just a procession of small delights from science. A big moment could be looming fast. Beagle 2 is on board Mars Express and closing on the planet at 11,341mph. Both orbiter and lander are packed with sophisticated hardware but the big question has hardly changed in a century: is there, was there once, could there ever have been, life on Mars? \"I don't know, I mean I am always in two minds, that's why I am a Liberal Democrat. Sometimes I think there has just got to have been life on Mars. There has to have been, it had everything, it had the ingredients, it had water, it has got carbon,\" she says. \"If life is simply a chemical process, it must have taken place on Mars, it must have done. But it has presumably also ceased because Mars has become dead and desolate. Mars has no internal engine, like the Earth has, it has no atmosphere, it is a hostile place. OK, some of the bacteria that got going on Earth 3bn years ago, their descendants are on Earth now, and so perhaps there were things living on Mars 3bn years ago and they are still managing to eke out some tiny little existence within rocks _ I don't think it is going to be an easy search to find life on Mars. My gut feeling is it has to be there but it is probably either dormant or dead. I would be thrilled to bits, tickled pink, over the moon, beyond Mars, if we find life living on Mars. But I will be surprised.\" Channel 4 supplied her with a personal shopper to prepare for her TV debut. \"Who used to work with Trinny and Susannah. But who is now working with S-Club Juniors. And Posh Beckham. And I am somewhere in between. It was great fun. We didn't have a very large budget and I squandered it all on one black velvet coat.\" If the coat doesn't make an impact, think about the asteroid named after her - 4731 Monicagrady, out there in the asteroid belt, far beyond Mars. \"There are no actual measurements, but we do know its magnitude, how much light it reflects back and from that you can infer that it is about 12 by 15km. So it's quite a small one. It is in a very stable part of the main belt. So unless something very strange happens it is never going to arrive here.\" Further reading Search for Life, by Monica Grady (Natural History Museum, \u00a39.95). ISBN 0565091573.
