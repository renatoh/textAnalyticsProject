The grand new Queensferry Crossing across the Forth was opened to global acclaim and a few days later Scotland was voted the most beautiful country in the world by readers of the Rough Guide series of travel books. The New York Times serenaded Glasgow with an article that told its readers about the delights of spending 36 hours in the city. And over the course of five days the international football team won two games without conceding a goal that allowed the nation to dream for a few weeks that we might qualify for a World Cup. Short of outright independence, it\u2019s difficult to see how many more cherries we could fit into our bowl. This being Scotland, though, it would be sinful to get too carried away. The nation\u2019s relationship with optimism is one of passionate love followed inevitably by casual betrayal, after which we all sport the national costume of sackcloth and ashes. I woke clammy from a nightmare last week in which we had actually qualified for the World Cup in Qatar only for the tournament to be cancelled because of a nuclear strike by that wee bam Kim Jong-un. In the meantime, we might as well take the adulation while it\u2019s going; it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re ever going to grow accustomed to it. The responses to the opening of the new Queensferry Crossing more or less defined the political and cultural divisions across the nation since the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said that all Scotland was \u201cbursting with pride\u201d at the opening of the new bridge and among the multitudes who walked across it before it was open to traffic were many wearing Yes badges and saltires. Some of us felt a bit queasy about this: it is, after all, just a bridge (albeit a magnificent one) and no Scottish firms were deemed to have a sufficiency of skills to win any of the construction tenders. Yet I soon felt my initial reserve melting in the feverishly hostile response by rightwing commentators and politicians who seemed regretful that the bridge had actually been built at all. Whenever pride is expressed in anything Scottish these days, a flotilla of prominent pro-UK supporters is always on hand to sniff out any signs of scrofulous nationalism. Arguably, the accolade of being voted the planet\u2019s most beautiful country by a globally recognised travel publication is much more valuable. The boost to the Scottish economy from an increase in visitor numbers, one of our key economic indicators, will be immense. And though it\u2019s much more difficult to predict an increase in inward investment stemming directly from the award, it will certainly heighten economic interest. Yet the response to the Rough Guide accolade seemed much more measured. Perhaps this was because more of us have begun to acknowledge and appreciate just how beautiful Scotland is. In recent years, Scotland has been garlanded with international visitor commendations, from possessing some of the world\u2019s most desirable islands to offering one of the world\u2019s best student experiences. Indeed, only last week, five Scottish universities featured in a list of the world\u2019s top 200 compiled by the Times Higher Education rankings. Perhaps, too, there is a gnawing sense of self-awareness about all the natural beauty that Scotland possesses. The patterns of inequality that are stitched into the fabric of Scotland\u2019s most densely populated areas mean that very few people from these communities will rarely, if at all, get the opportunity to appreciate what is in their own back garden. The cost of taking a family for a holiday, even a short break, in some of our most beautiful places is not cheap. How many of us would swap much of Scotland\u2019s natural beauty for being able to reduce the huge number of our children who still live in poverty? Last week, too, it was revealed that the CEO of McDonald\u2019s is paid more than \u00a311m a year while some of his workers are earning as little as \u00a34.75 an hour. The previous week, it was revealed that Scotland\u2019s top CEOs are paid on average 24 times the salary earned by their workers. This feeds into a perfect storm of need that also includes Scotland\u2019s social and affordable housing crisis. This has driven more families into unaffordable debt as they are forced to fall on the tender mercies of private landlordism and exploitative rent rates. According to the latest house conditions survey in a report compiled by the Unison trade union, 840,000 households were in fuel poverty and 47.5% of dwellings failed to reach the Scottish housing quality standard. Almost 50,000 dwellings, or 2% of the total, were below tolerable standard or not fit to live in. The report goes on: \u201cThe most recent housing statistics show that 167,122 applicants were on housing lists at March 2016 \u2013 of which 24,600 were for a transfer and 142,500 were waiting to enter social housing. Meanwhile, the market continues to fail to provide the scale of housebuilding which is required. The private sector is building virtually half the number of houses it was prior to the economic crash of 2008 \u2013 with 11,917 completions in 2015 compared with 21,679 in 2007.\u201d The SNP government says it has the highest house-building rate anywhere in the UK. Clearly, though, the rate is still nowhere near enough to meet the need, a consequence of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s right-to-buy policy. This stemmed less from a desire to improve the quality of life for working-class people than a craving to stimulate the financial services industry that collapsed under its own greed and corruption in 2008. It\u2019s good to live and work in such a beautiful country. It would be even better, though, if more of my fellow Scots could afford the opportunities to appreciate it too. Perhaps they might consider paying for a holiday in someone else\u2019s home once they have stopped worrying about finding one of their own that they can afford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
