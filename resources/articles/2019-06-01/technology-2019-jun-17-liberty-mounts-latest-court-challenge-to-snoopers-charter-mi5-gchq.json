In its latest challenge to the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), the civil rights organisation Liberty has argued that government surveillance practices breach human rights law. Of the multiple powers authorised by the legislation \u2013 labelled by critics as the \u201csnooper\u2019s charter\u201d \u2013 the ability to interfere with computers, mobiles and other equipment amounts to the greatest invasion of individuals\u2019 privacy, the court was told. Appearing for Liberty, Martin Chamberlain QC explained that the IPA \u201cprovides for a wide expansion of bulk secret surveillance powers\u201d, undermining articles 8 and 10 of the European convention on human rights which guarantee privacy and freedom of expression. He warned of the \u201cinherent dangers\u201d of bulk hacking powers, by which the intelligence services could take \u201cremote control of a device, for example, to turn mobile phones with cameras into recording devices \u2026 or to log keystrokes to capture passwords,\u201d thereby potentially overriding any encryption. Chamberlain cautioned about \u201cthe dangers of secret surveillance regimes\u201d, which arose from \u201cthe possibility of abuse of power necessarily exercised in secret, and the generally chilling effect on individuals\u2019 communications and expression of ideas caused by the existence of such powers.\u201d Other powers in the act, he said, \u201cpermit the interception or obtaining, processing, retention and examination of the private information of very large numbers of people \u2013 in some cases, the whole population. They also permit serious invasions of journalistic and watchdog organisations\u2019 materials and lawyer-client communication.\u201d He said MI5 and GCHQ could intercept data that \u201cshows, for example, that an individual has accessed a website containing information about sexual health or abortion or suicide,\u201d and this data \u201cwould be searchable without a warrant\u201d. Vulnerabilities that have been built into software to allow law enforcement access cause \u201creal and significant risks\u201d that third parties could exploit them. The WannaCry online attack, by which hackers infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide with ransomware in 2017 attack, represented \u201can example of the kind of unintended consequences that state bulk hacking activities \u2026 can have,\u201d he said. But Sir James Eadie QC, representing the government, argued that the powers provided by IPA \u201cstrike an appropriate balance between security and individual privacy\u201d. He said in his written submission: \u201cThe powers under challenge are of critical importance to, and are effective in securing, the protection of the public from a range of serious and sophisticated threats arising in the context of terrorism, hostile state activity and serious/organised crime.\u201d Last week it emerged that MI5 had lost control of its data storage operations. MI5 admitted there were \u201cungoverned spaces\u201d on its computers where it did not know what it held. In parliamentary debates about the Investigatory Powers Act, the government insisted the security services conducted only targeted searches of data under legal warrants in pursuit of terrorist or criminal activity, and that bulk interception was necessary as a first step in that process. Compliance with the Investigatory Powers Act is overseen by the investigatory powers commissioner, Lord Justice Fulford, who has announced he is stepping down from the role in October almost six months earlier than scheduled. He is to become vice-president of the criminal division of the court of appeal. In comments revealed during legal action last week, it emerged that Fulford had written to MI5 warning that future applications for interception warrants \u201cwill not be approved by the judicial commissioners\u201d unless there were improvements to its storage practices. The National Union of Journalists has intervened in the Liberty case, arguing that there are insufficient safeguards in the act to protect confidential journalistic sources. Before the hearing, Megan Goulding, a lawyer at Liberty, said: \u201cIn creating the snoopers\u2019 charter, the UK government has attempted to legitimise the most sweeping and intrusive mass surveillance powers to be found anywhere in the democratic world. These powers allow the state to collect the messages, location and browsing history of innocent, ordinary people without grounds for suspicion. \u201cWe are bringing this challenge because this law has no place in any credible democracy, least of all one with such a long and proud history of defending individual liberty. The government must introduce a targeted surveillance regime that does not require its citizens to sacrifice their rights to privacy and freedom of expression.\u201d Responding to the legal action, the security minister, Ben Wallace, said: \u201cWe live in a world where paedophiles groom children online, terrorists continue to plot attacks and where hostile states have attempted assassination on our streets. It is therefore imperative that our law enforcement and security and intelligence agencies have the tools they need to protect us all from these very real threats to our security, prosperity and our way of life. \u201cPolice and intelligence officers who use these investigatory powers every day do so within a strict set of rules and are overseen by ministers and the independent investigatory powers commissioner. We will continue to defend the investigatory powers regime in court.\u201d The hearing, at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, is expected to last five days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
