Lee, who was president from 2008 to 2013, is accused of accepting bribes worth about 11bn won (\u00a37.4m) from South Korea\u2019s national intelligence agency and businesses, reportedly including Samsung. \u201cEach accusation he faces is a significant offence that requires formal arrest,\u201d an official from the prosecutor\u2019s office said, according to Yonhap news. \u201cWe explained the unavoidable need for his arrest, and also that there is a great risk of him destroying evidence since he has denied even basic facts related to the allegations.\u201d In response, Lee\u2019s office said he \u201ccannot accept the charges outlaid by the state prosecutors\u201d and he planned to \u201cfight with full-fledged effort to get the truth out at court\u201d. The likely arrest comes a year after Lee\u2019s successor, Park Geun-hye, was arrested on corruption charges following months of street protests. She became the first South Korean president to be impeached in December 2016 and prosecutors last month asked for her to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for accepting \u00a315m in bribes. Lee, 76, was questioned by police last week for a total of 21 hours over two days. \u201cI stand here with a heavy heart,\u201d Lee said when he arrived at the prosecutors\u2019 office in Seoul last week, confronting a bank of television cameras. \u201cI hope that I will be the last former president to stand here.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for causing concern to the people,\u201d he told reporters, adding that the security situation on the Korean peninsula was \u201cdire\u201d. He has previously called the investigation \u201cpolitical revenge\u201d and denied the charges against him. He is accused of accepting bribes from Samsung in exchange for a pardon for the company\u2019s chairman. The charges date back to his presidential run in 2007 when he allegedly took bribes from a buddhist monk who wanted Lee\u2019s help in establishing a university. Lee, a former Hyundai executive, is also accused of using his presidential power to settle a legal case against an auto parts company he secretly owned. He reportedly then had Samsung pay the company\u2019s legal fees. He is also accused of moving classified government documents to a warehouse owned by DAS, the auto-parts company. Prosecutors are also investigating Lee\u2019s wife, Kim Yoon-ok, on suspicion that she accepted about \u00a3660,000 in bribes from sources including the national intelligence service. Lee will probably become the fourth former president to face criminal charges. Aside from Park, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo were convicted of bribery and sedition in 1996 but were pardoned a year later. Roh Moo-hyun was not formally charged, but committed suicide in 2009 after being questioned by prosecutors on allegations of graft. The current South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, accused Lee of targeting Roh in an effort to discredit liberal politicians. \u2022 The subheading on this article was amended on 20 March 2018 because an earlier version said Lee was accused of accepting \u00a37.4bn worth of bribes. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
