Walker was speaking to an audience in London at the international affairs thinktank Chatham House while on a four-day trade mission to the UK, which is being interpreted as an attempt to demonstrate the Wisconsin governor\u2019s credentials as an international statesman. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave that up to you,\u201d he said, when he was asked the question by BBC journalist Justin Webb. \u201cI\u2019m here to talk about trade not to pontificate on other issues. I love the evolution of trade in Wisconsin and I\u2019d like to see an even bigger evolution as well.\u201d Webb, who was chairing the talk, responded that \u201cany British politician, right- or leftwing, would laugh and say \u2018yes of course evolution is true\u2019\u201d. As part of the trip, which is ostensibly to promote trade ties between the UK and his state, Walker visited former prime minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s grave, went to Brookwood military cemetery in Surrey and watched prime minister\u2019s questions from the public gallery. He also had private meetings with prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne. In his speech, Walker said: \u201cIt was my honour to pay respects to your Iron Lady.\u201d When asked what he thought of prime minister\u2019s questions, he said: \u201cI found myself listening to questions and thinking what would I say, how would my response be.\u201d On the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the UK and the US, Walker said: \u201cJust like two dear friends, our countries have stood together and fought two world wars.\u201d He said the two countries have \u201ctriumphed over the forces of evil not once but twice\u201d. The Wisconsin governor repeatedly refused to answer questions on US foreign policy, saying that it would be impolite and disrespectful to the US president to talk about the subject on foreign soil and saying that he was on an official visit to promote trade with his state. Walker also stressed his commitment to free trade, saying that it even extended to his state\u2019s precious cheese market. \u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d he said, \u201cif my state was a country it would rank fourth in the world for cheese production, just behind the United States, France and Germany, and just above Italy. \u201cWe believe we make [cheese] better than anybody in the world, but we don\u2019t begrudge anybody trying to make a better cheese. In other words, we say let the best cheese win.\u201d Walker is in the UK while a row blazes in his home state over a proposed $300m (\u00a3187m) funding cut to the University of Wisconsin and the changing of the institution\u2019s century-old mission statement. At Chatham House, he said the proposal was about balancing \u201cquality and cost\u201d and that the cuts would be made up for by savings. The New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, who is also thought to have his sights on the Republican presidential nomination, visited the UK on a similar trip last week. The visit backfired when he was caught off-guard by questioning from journalists. Asked about the debate surrounding the safety of measles vaccines, Christie said that although he had had his children vaccinated, it should be a choice for parents. His comments were criticised as contributing to misinformation about the vaccine. Walker is thought to be trying to avoid a similar fate by steering clear of too much confrontation with the press on his trip. Walker defended Christie during his Chatham House talk, saying he was treated unfairly by journalists: \u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t the most substantive thing that he said while he was out here, but for whatever reason that was the lead ... It\u2019s another example of where [the media] go to whatever is the most glaring headline, and not the substance.\u201d It is Walker\u2019s third official overseas trade mission, after trips to China and Japan, since he became governor in 2011. He is also planning a trip to Israel, a common destination for aspiring presidents. The UK is another favourite of aspiring presidential candidates. Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, Texas governor Rick Perry, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio have all visited in the past year. Hillary Clinton visited the UK to promote her book last summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
