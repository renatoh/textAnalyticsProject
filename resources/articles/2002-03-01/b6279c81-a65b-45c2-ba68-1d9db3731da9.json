Dips into the transfer market to sign Frenchman Lauren Robert and Welsh striker Craig Bellamy cost Bobby Robson \u00a316m, but in an effort to strengthen his squad the clubs player trading deficit increased to \u00a36.1m leaving the Magpies suffering a \u00a31.4m pre-tax loss in the six months ending January 31 2002. Their loss over the past six months compares to a previous profit of \u00a35000 but Newcastle may feel its money well spent as they currently lie fourth in the Premiership and continue their push for a place in Europe. \"Our ambition is to get into European football, and we hope that will be the Champions League next season,\" said non-executive chairman John Fender. \"It has been a strong six months and we are continuing to grow revenues as a result of the stadium expansion, revised media rights and pursuit of other commercial opportunities,\" he added on Newcastle's website nufc.co.uk. Fender was highlighting the underlying strength of the club as a business with turnover up 11 percent to \u00a335.8m helped by a 37 percent boost in television revenue, while operating profit before player trading was up 16 percent at \u00a37.9m. St James' Park now has a capacity of 52,200, making it the second biggest ground to Old Trafford, from which it continues to gain. Since the reign of Ruud Gullit the squad has been reduced from 54 to the low 30s and the average age has also been lowered to 23. Players wages only equate to 42 percent of turnover compared with most of the Premiership clubs hovering around the 50 percent mark. Yesterday the club had welcomed the news that their plans to build a permanent base on North Tyneside for itsYouth Academy had been given the green light. Alongside the preparation of six football pitches and an indoor training area at Darsley Park in Benton the Club are also providing funds to improve local sports facilities, offering the use of selected football pitches and a new cricket pitch to the local community. Chairman Freddy Shepherd is delighted at the news. The new academy will allow us to compete with the Premiership elite. Manchester United and Liverpool have had their turn but now it's our turn with the likes of Shola Ameobi, Michael Chopra and the many other promising youngsters we have."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
