The Australian emerged triumphant in a time of 1min 44.71sec to claim his second gold after winning the 400m freestyle at the weekend. The Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband took silver in 1:45.23 and the American Michael Phelps collected the bronze in 1:45.32. Amir Khan, Britain's only boxing representative in the games, used his lightning jab and reflexes to out-class the home favourite Marios Kaperonis, with the referee stopping the fight after one minute 40 seconds of the third round. The Bolton lightweight, 17, is the youngest fighter in the Olympic competition. Ben Ainslie lost an appeal against his disqualification from the second race in the Finn class but the gold medal hopeful now leads the discipline after six of the 11 races. Ainslie had a fourth-place finish in race five in the morning and followed that up with a third win of the regatta in the afternoon to move ahead of Spain's Rafael Trujillo. Lowlights Sarah Gibbins, Team GB's only woman shooter, became the third Briton to misfire her way out of the Olympics, joining the Sydney silver medal winner Ian Peel and Ed Ling in failing to qualify for their respective finals. The primary school teacher was two shots away from the top six and a place in this afternoon's final in the women's trap. Melanie Marshall, the fastest woman in the world this year in the 200m freestyle, finished last in her semi-final. The 22-year-old from Lincolnshire went out with all guns blazing and took control of the race to lead at the 150m mark but ran out of steam in the final 50m. Quote of the day \"I'm thinking it's going to be a hit-and-run attack while I am standing in line for food or something\" - Andy Roddick is watching his back after hearing the Australian women's water-polo team will give \u00a3300 to the first girl who lands a kiss on the US Open champion.
