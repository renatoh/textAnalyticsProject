There have been a number of impressively low lows so far, including Chris Christie\u2019s bizarre mock trial of Clinton on Tuesday. And then there are the merchandise stands, which are doing a brisk trade in pins and shirts emblazoned with insults more petty than witty. One of the hottest shirts at the convention, for example, is the \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d number that you can accessorize with a \u201cLife\u2019s a bitch, don\u2019t vote for one\u201d pin. However, ladies and gentlemen, I think we may have just reached a new low! It\u2019s the Bill Clinton rape shirt. The latest fashion must-have for the classless in Cleveland sports a picture of his face with rape in block capitals underneath, making a nuanced reference to allegations against the prospective first gentleman. The creative director behind this number is Infowars host Roger Stone \u2013 a longtime Trump supporter. While the rape shirt may not exactly be subtle, it is symbolic \u2013 not just of the tone of the RNC but of the election as a whole. The T-shirt is representative of some of the most important issues at play in this year\u2019s election. The first is the increasing use of misinformation as a campaign strategy in a post-factual world. This recently played out in the Brexit vote, where the leave campaign successfully betted on the power of fantasy over fact. As the Guardian\u2019s editor Kath Viner recently wrote, \u201cWhen a fact begins to resemble whatever you feel is true, it becomes very difficult for anyone to tell the difference between facts that are true and \u2018facts\u2019 that are not.\u201d So if you call Clinton a rapist enough times, then it\u2019s likely that people will start to believe it is a \u201cfact\u201d. There are lies, there are damned lies, and there are damned lies that help win elections. Trump has long been aware of the power of spreading misinformation and has found a kindred spirit in Alex Jones, who is considered by many to be America\u2019s leading conspiracy theorist. Both Trump and Jones have raised Clinton\u2019s rape allegations before; Jones discusses them in a YouTube clip titled Donald Trump Accuses Bill Clinton of Rape, for example. What is clear from this clip is what really outrages Trump and Clinton is not the idea of rape itself, but the idea that the Democratic party is criticizing Trump for being misogynistic while Clinton has a history of unsubstantiated rape accusations. Which leads us to the second big issue: Trump\u2019s strategy for winning women. You see women don\u2019t really like Trump, God knows why. Trump probably wouldn\u2019t care but seeing as women make up 51% of the population and more women vote than men, he needs them. Particularly as Clinton is in possession of that pesky woman card, you know? So, in the past few months, Trump has made something of an effort to woo women. In April, for example, he wheeled out his wife and daughter to explain to the media that he\u2019s actually a misunderstood feminist. And on Monday he held a Women Vote Trump event. Unfortunately it was very, very empty. Trump seems both unlikely and unwilling to win women with kindness at this stage. So it seems that he\u2019s trying to take women\u2019s support by forcefully discrediting Democrats, rape being sort of discrediting. The final thing the T-shirt is a sign of? Well, that it\u2019s probably the worst election ever. You might think rape-as-fashion-accessory would be rock bottom, but I\u2019m afraid November is still a while away and there\u2019s likely a lot more low to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
