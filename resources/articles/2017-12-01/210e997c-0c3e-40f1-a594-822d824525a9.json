Wilshere, who has been at Arsenal since the age of nine and spent last season on loan at Bournemouth, started his fourth successive Premier League game in his team\u2019s 3-2 victory at Crystal Palace and set up the visitors\u2019 decisive third goal. \u201cI probably feel better than I did last year,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel fitter, and am getting better each game. I spoke to the boss [about contract talks] and he said he will speak to me. I\u2019m sure it will get done.\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger subsequently confirmed those talks will take place next month, once the cluttered fixture schedule over the festive period has been concluded. \u201cThe situation is that we need to sit down with him,\u201d said the Arsenal manager. \u201cAt the beginning of January, it\u2019s planned. \u201cThere is no delay. I said we would sort out his situation at the end of December, and so I told him we want to meet and sit down with him to talk about the future. That\u2019s what I did. Now we play today, we play on Sunday, we play on Wednesday. At the moment the focus has to be on the games.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
