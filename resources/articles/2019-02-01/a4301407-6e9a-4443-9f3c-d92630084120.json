Mill owners and city government responded in a swift and heavy-handed manner; local militias and police forces were called to the streets. Protesters died. Many more were arrested. On a cold, blustery February day 107 years later, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren stood in front of Everett Mill to announce her candidacy for president of the United States, channeling the spirit of those women as she told her supporters that they were in a fight for their lives against a rigged system that favors the rich and powerful. \u201cThese workers \u2013 led by women \u2013 didn\u2019t have much. Not even a common language. Nevertheless, they persisted,\u201d she said. \u201cThe story of Lawrence is about how real change happens in America. It\u2019s a story about power \u2013 our power \u2013 when we fight together.\u201d For Warren, who grew up in an economically struggling Oklahoma household and who first rose to mainstream prominence by handing out practical financial advice to American families, the word \u201cfight\u201d is central to her platform and political ethos \u2013 it was a word peppered throughout her speech. But on Saturday, she made clear that hers was not just a fight against president Donald Trump, but against a system she described as one where the rich, privileged and powerful oppress the rest of the country. \u201cThe man in the White House is not the cause of what is broken, he is just the latest \u2013 and most extreme \u2013 symptom of what\u2019s gone wrong in America, a product of a rigged system that props up the rich and the powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else,\u201d she said. \u201cSo once he\u2019s gone, we can\u2019t pretend that all of this never happened.\u201d The backdrop of the mill, where the so-called Bread and Roses strikes originated, was symbolic. But so too was the choice of the modern day city of Lawrence, which is one of those places in America that has felt left behind in recent times. To many in New England, Lawrence is synonymous with crime, drugs and poverty. The Republican governors of Maine and New Hampshire have invoked the city\u2019s name when laying blame for the opioid crises in their states. As was the case at the time of the strikes, Lawrence is a working class city of immigrants, with a population that is about 80% Latino. It is a city where wealth is nearby, but out of reach for many. Sebastian Brown, 31, moved to Lawrence five years ago. While he had yet to choose a candidate to support, he was excited by Warren\u2019s message and was happy Warren chose the town as the site of her announcement. \u201cThis is a working class city. And I think her \u2013 and Bernie [Sanders] \u2013 are running on platforms that speak to the working class and how they\u2019re being screwed over by the rich and powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think she\u2019s a great messenger for it.\u201d While there was optimism about Warren\u2019s candidacy at her rally, she enters an already crowded Democratic field amid renewed controversy over her past identification as Native American. For years now \u2013 since even before he was president \u2013 Trump has needled Warren on the issue, calling her \u201cPocahontas\u201d. He and others accuse Warren of falsely presenting herself as Native American to gain unfair advantages in life. The controversy was re-ignited last week when the Washington Post published Warren\u2019s 1986 registration card for the Texas State Bar. In it, she listed \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d as her race. Warren has now apologised repeatedly for identifying as Native American, saying in recent days that she \u201cshould have been more mindful of the distinction with tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty\u201d. She still maintains that Native American ancestry was part of her family\u2019s story passed down to her. How damaging the controversy will be remains to be see. Warren enters a diverse Democratic field where other candidates belong to minority groups: New Jersey senator Cory Booker is African American; California senator Kamala Harris was born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is both the first Hindu and first Samoan-American member of Congress, and the former San Antonio mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro is Latino. When the Democratic race gets heated, Warren\u2019s portrayal of race could prove to be a point of attack. Peter Devlin, a 56-year-old dentist from the nearby town of North Andover, said he was at the rally to hear what Warren had to say but said that the Native American controversy \u201cis going to be a problem\u201d for her campaign. \u201cI voted for her as senator, but I\u2019m concerned about her electability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough run. She\u2019s got a bit of baggage and she\u2019s so sort of cliche progressive liberal that I think there\u2019s a lot of America that\u2019s not up for that. But I want to hear what she\u2019s up to.\u201d However, other attendees, like 64-year-old Vicki Ward, who drove two hours to the event from Vermont, were ready to throw their support behind Warren on the first day of the senator\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cI think she\u2019s got the qualities that we need,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need a woman president and I think it will be the fight of our lives.\u201d Maryann Johnson, who came to Warren\u2019s announcement from New Hampshire, also said she was already sold on Warren. \u201cI basically agreed with everything she said. We need to have more equality, there needs to be less corruption in government,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s inspiring.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
