Her comment was made in the wake of the recommendation by the International Olympic Committee's Programme Commission that eventing should be excluded from the Olympics. The president says the FEI will be contesting the decision. The high cost of creating event courses is one of the main reasons why the IOC wants to drop the sport from the games. Yet the course in Jerez, although not an Olympic one, has cost \u00a32m. By comparison 24 new fences, out of a total of 32, built for the recent Burghley Horse Trials cost \u00a3170,000. Mike Tucker, the course designer here, described the Princess's comments as \"unreasonable\" and said that he had not had total control over the amount of money spent. The eventing in Jerez begins today with the first of two days of dressage. Britain have been drawn eighth out of the 13 teams. Meanwhile the pure dressage is already under way, with Britain making a shaky start yesterday. Peter Storr on Gambrinus and Emile Faurie, on the highly strung Insterburg, gained scores of 63.04% and 63.20% respectively, well below their personal bests. The other two riders, Laura Richardson and Richard Davison, go today and need to produce better results if Britain are to achieve anything."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
