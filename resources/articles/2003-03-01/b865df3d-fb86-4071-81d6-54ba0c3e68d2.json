Following the death of Princess Diana in 1997 the press agreed to back off from the princes until they had finished full-time education - in return for regular photo calls. \"An agreement has to be two-way. Since the agreement there has been very little in the way of material from the palace, particularly for the Sunday papers,\" Coulson told a parliamentary inquiry into privacy and media intrusion. His remarks follow the publication of pictures of Prince William in the News of the World at the weekend, dressed in jeans and a baseball cap and carrying Tesco shopping bags in the streets of St Andrews where he is in his second year at university. \"The spirit of the agreement was that on a regular basis we would have material,\" said Coulson. Giving evidence to the committee earlier, Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan described the princes as \"a huge commercial property\", a phrase which Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger referred to later in the session as \"an odd way to describe them\". At the weekend St James' Palace suggested the Prince William pictures were in breach of the agreement, but Coulson said he took exception to this accusation and described the pictures as \"inoffensive\". \"We considered them to be quite charming in the way they presented the royal family,\" Coulson added. He denied the pictures invaded Prince William's privacy. \"It was clearly not a breach of the [press complaints commission] code - these pictures were taken in public.\" Coulson said even though Prince William's 21st birthday is approaching, St James' Palace has not yet announced any plans to the media for marking the event. However, he added that the News of the World made clear in its leader column on Sunday that last weekend's pictures did not mark \"open season\" on Prince William or any other members of the royal family. Coulson, together with the editor of the Sun, Rebekah Wade, was giving evidence to a Commons select committee inquiry investigating whether the current system of press self-regulation works. Wade said the Sun was \"very proud of the PCC and self-regulation\". She added that the newspaper was proud of the way the PCC has changed the newspaper industry over the last 10 years, and said that its director, Guy Black, and his team offered ordinary people \"a very good service\". \"The days of foot-in-the-door harassment and snatched photos are gone,\" Wade said in a letter to the inquiry. Giving evidence today, she said last summer's Soham tragedy was a perfect example of the PCC working well. When the commission requested that all newspapers leave Soham, they did so immediately. The inquiry is focusing on ordinary people whose privacy had been invaded by the press. \"Ordinary people are my readers. If people are unhappy with my newspaper when I go into the office the phones are ringing,\" said Wade. \"It tends to be the rich, the powerful, the famous who complain about privacy.\" Wade admitted, however, that in the past the Sun has paid police officers for information. It is illegal for a police officer to accept money in return for information. Both Wade and Coulson said journalists on their newspapers were well trained in understanding and abiding by the PCC's editorial code of practice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
