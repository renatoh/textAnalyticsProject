The Spaniard left the field in injury time to a standing ovation, the least he deserved for a hat-trick which secured Liverpool three points to alleviate the pressure on his manager. All three goals showcased Torres's astonishing, lethal touch in front of goal, an inherent awareness of the goalscorer's art, his raw pace and power. Given the stop-start nature of his debut season in English football and the rollercoaster nature of his team's campaign to date, a return of 21 goals by this stage of the season borders on the amazing. 'In terms of his adaptation, it not easy for a foreign player the first year,' said Ben\u00edtez. 'But we knew he is a player with power, with pace and in the English game sometimes you can kill defenders with pace. Last summer we were monitoring a list of maybe 10 strikers, and in the end we had two or three good options, but we decided on Torres because he is young, hungry and the conditioning he has would be good for the Premier League.' But not good for Middlesbrough, on this occasion, although the visitors stunned Liverpool by taking the lead and had chances to make this a closer contest. Instead, the afternoon concluded on an even more costly note for Boro, with J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re shown a straight red card five minutes from time by referee Lee Mason following a minor altercation with Javier Mascherano. 'He raised his hands though he's not exactly floored the opponent,\" said Boro manager Gareth Southgate. 'You have to accept if you raise your hands in the modern game, with a young referee, you are going to be punished. It's a lesson J\u00e9r\u00e9mie has to learn. 'It's a strange feeling. We're very, very down. We feel we have given Liverpool a hell of a game and feel we should have taken something from it.' After last week's humbling against Barnsley in the FA Cup, a strong start was imperative for Liverpool. Instead, Ryan Babel handled on the edge of the area and Stewart Downing's superbly weighted free-kick hurtled in the direction of three unmarked Boro players. Turkish striker Tuncay Sanli eventually had the simple task of steering his header past Jose Reina. It was not an auspicious start by Liverpool, particularly considering the game was being played before a rare appearance by one of the club's controversial American ownership group, Tom Hicks junior, son of the Texan co-owner. But any side featuring the sublime talents of Torres can never be discounted and, twice within one first-half minute, he effectively determined the game. In the 28th minute, Reina's long kick should have been better dealt with by the Boro defence and Julio Arca's weak backward header was always likely to end in disaster. So it proved, as Torres sprinted ahead, rounded keeper Mark Schwarzer and assuredly beat the covering defender on the line. If that effort hinted at the ruthless efficiency possessed by the Spaniard, it was nothing compared with his second goal - his 20th of the season in all competitions - which followed seconds later. Fabio Aurelio played a square ball to Torres, stationary 20 yards out, and with his marker David Wheater failing to close him down, the striker took a touch and beat Schwarzer from that distance with a lethal low shot. Holding a one-goal edge, there was still cause for concern for the home supporters, not least when Tuncay had the ball in their net for a second time from a Downing cross only for the 'goal' to be correctly disallowed for blatant handball, an infringement initially missed by the assistant referee. It was a nerve-jangling period for Liverpool and their fans, but one which, predictably, given events of the first 61 minutes, Torres brought to a close with his hat-trick goal. Dirk Kuyt's diagonal long ball fell just on the edge of the Boro area and caused uncertainty between Wheater and Schwarzer, who dithered outside their box to allow Torres to hook the ball cleverly around them and into the open goal. Seven minutes remained when Downing collected Arca's pass, ghosted past Yossi Benayoun and the out-of-position Steve Finnan, to score from a tricky angle but, with the Aliadi\u00e8re dismissal following shortly afterwards, it was insufficient to salvage anything."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
