Invited by a friend to attend the N\u00fcrburgring 1,000km race and that year's grand prix at Spa, he discovered an enduring love of, and affinity for, motor racing, resulting in some famously dramatic pictures. From a vast portfolio, some of the best are now on show at an exhibition (Proud Gallery, Camden \u2013 proud.co.uk) timed to coincide with the publication of a 200-page collection of his work. Both are entitled: The Golden Age of Formula 1 (book out mid-October, published by teNeues, \u00a360). The cars are, of course, the stars. Schlegelmilch describing his aspiration to \"freeze the speed in a photo\" amply demonstrated in the iconic shot of Stefan Johansson's Ferrari as he comes off the gas at Monaco. He has captured it so well, so often. There's a vertigo-inducing sensation as Emerson Fittipaldi's beautiful black and gold John Player Special Lotus leaps out of the frame as it exits a crowded pit lane at Brands. And a palpable sense of power from Peter Gethin's McLaren, in a beautiful swathe of half-light and spray at Spain's Montjuic in 1971. However, understandbly for a photographer who seen so many, he has also taken a fantastic range of driver shots. Again many of theses are instantly recognisable: Michael Schumacher turning in towards the camera; Aryton Senna as he puts on his fireproof balaclava; Damon Hill glowering at some out-of-shot detail. Damon's father Graham features throughout as well: imperious, thoughtful, celebratory, intense. As if Schlegelmilch had been present at every significant moment of his life. It is the breadth of these portraits that really emphasises the length of his career: The Kansas City Flash \u2013 Masten Gregory smoking a cigarette, resplendent in NHS specs at Monza in '62; Stirling Moss, Jackie Stewart, Bruce McLaren, Jim Clark, John Surtees, Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost, even a stolen moment of Jochen Rindt, his wife Nina and Colin Chapman, whose look, styles and colour absolutely encapsulates the 1970s from which it was taken. He has also visited 40 years worth of tracks, Monaco is still a favourite \u2013 a circuit where photographers used to be able to stand inside the corners and where its layout still allows them closer to the cars than any other. So Monte Carlo then, but also the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife (Stewart again, this time airborne), S\u00e3o Paulo, downhill from the old pits toward Eau Rogue at Spa, the Tifosi at Imola, Zandvoort and even the volcanic undulations of Clermont-Ferrand have come under Schlegelmilch's ornate scrutiny. The exhibition is well-timed for race fans as well. It launches the day before the Goodwood Revival Meeting (Friday 17-Sunday 19, goodwood.co.uk), a wonderful celebration of the sport's golden age, combining genuine racing with dressing-up and nostalgia \u2013 a unique chance to see some of the cars Schlegelmilch photographed, first-hand and flat-out on the track.
