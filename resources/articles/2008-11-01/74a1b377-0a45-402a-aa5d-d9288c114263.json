But here's an interesting new development - according to Stars and Stripes magazine, a special videogame unit has been set up to procure and modify commercial games for training use. From the article: The Army gaming unit will watch trends in the industry and identify technology that can be used for military training. The need for video games as training aids was judged so great that the Army wanted to get products out to units before the funding came online. In addition to the $50 million, the Army gaming unit has an undisclosed additional budget to purchase a state-of-the-art commercial video game system that will be fielded for training in February. If, for any reason, conscription is re-introduced, it'll definitely the Army gaming unit that I'll ask to be assigned to. Anyway, at the moment, the army is using a rather decrepit shooter named Darwars Ambush as its main teaching tool. Apparently it teaches players how to react to ambushes and roadside bomb attacks on convoys, but there are no editing tools and only a handful of soldiers can play at once. There's a new game on the way though - no, it's not Gears of War 2 (I'm pretty sure American soldiers don't employ underslung chainsaws on their rifles in Iraq). It's currently called Game After Ambush (eh?) and will be properly unveiled soon. It seems game developers have been invited to tender for the military contract - with $50m or more up for grabs, it's probably an attractive proposition. Also from the Stars and Stripes piece: The new game will also be able to interact with the Army's battle command systems that soldiers use in the real world to track equipment, enemy and friendly forces using computerized maps. Erm, did we learn nothing from War Games? (Via CNET)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
