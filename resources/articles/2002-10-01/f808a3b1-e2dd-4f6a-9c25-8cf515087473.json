Unfortunately, the marble table top broke a couple of years ago and has yet to be replaced, but we use the chairs every day. My grandmother was very Italian and very meticulous, so it depresses me that they're completely trashed. The kids have jumped all over them, and the weaving at the back is fraying. I keep thinking that one day, when I've got the money, I'll have them renovated. During the war, my grandparents were forced to flee Italy, as my grandfather was a communist, and one of the few things they managed to take with them was the table and these chairs, which ended up with them in a bedsit in Cheam. But later, when my father built a house for them in Wimbledon, the table and chairs became the centrepiece of that house. My grandmother was also a wonderful cook, and food was the focal point of her life. I would go to her house and sit down at the marble table with these chairs and have a fantastic meal. It's nice now that when my father, Richard, comes here for supper, we are still using them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
