Photograph: Don McPhee/The Guardian Martin Kettle, in his otherwise very well-written and heartfelt farewell to Darcey Bussell, makes a few mistakes that cannot be overlooked when analysing ballet within the context of modern dance. I have no doubt that \"no other dancer of our times has connected more naturally both with the dance and with the wider public\" than Bussell, as Kettle states. Many viewers tuned in to watch Bussell's Covent Garden farewell, including me. But I disagree with Kettle when he states: \"Bussell's departure will leave a big hole in British dance.\" There are nearly 5 million people participating in community dance each year in England, hardly a \"hole\". Moreover, a recent survey of over 50,000 14-year-olds showed dance was the second most popular physical activity after football. Whether this will result in more Fonteyns and Darceys is a moot point: the important element is that dance as a general activity has a strong presence throughout the country. Kettle takes ballet and its prima ballerina, Bussell, as the start and end-point of modern British dance. He even mentions Matthew Bourne, \"probably the most widely known name in British dance today\", as an example of how the public attitude towards dance has changed in the last decade. But the reality is much more complex. Ballet is a spectator dance - unlike participatory dance forms such as jazz, breakdance and salsa, which are equally if not more popular than ballet. Most people involved in dance are in classes that bring an immediate and sudden effect on mental and physical health. Yet, if we are to realise the four main points raised in last year's Dance Manifesto (download the pdf here), mentioned by Kettle, we will have to do more than call for ballet to have a higher profile. Ballet already boasts wide corporate support and has a range of private donors, so does not need more exposure. But many other British companies, dependent on the Arts Council, will see their funding cut as a consequence of the Olympics. They are the ones, alongside ballet, which give the UK the multicultural nature of which we are so proud. The manifesto asks clearly for dance to be an integral part of every young person's education: with its elitist nature, ballet polarises audiences rather than acting as a common denominator. And a quick look at the ticket prices of any ballet will prove to anyone that this dance form cannot be a benchmark for accessibility. Kettle mentions that he \"travelled to inner-city Peckham to watch a class of seven- and eight-year-olds rehearsing the Carnival of the Animals as part of the Royal Ballet's Chance to Dance programme\". As a ballet aficionado myself I cannot see how those children will be enthused to perform a dance that traces its origins to late-1400s Italy. If dance is to make it as a force majeure in 21st century Britain, it is important that it begins at the heart of our communities and with a level playing field for all its different forms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
