Emphatic victory in the 234th episode protected their eight-point lead at the Premier League summit, extended their unbeaten league run to a club-record 32 games and brought J\u00fcrgen Klopp his 100th league win as Liverpool manager. It is also likely to herald another period of expensive upheaval for their distressed neighbours. Everton\u2019s defence unravelled as their quest for a win at Anfield entered its 21st year and they conceded five goals in a derby for the first time since 1982. The defence for Marco Silva to remain as manager may well have crumbled too. His expensively assembled but gutless side languish in the relegation zone following an eighth defeat in 11 Premier League matches. They started here with a five-man defence, plus a four-man midfield blanket in front of them, yet were cut apart by the magnificent Sadio Man\u00e9 and Liverpool\u2019s recurring derby hero, Divock Origi. Equally as damning was that defeat came at the hands of a Liverpool side featuring five changes from Saturday\u2019s win over Brighton, only one forced on Klopp, and minus six of the players who started last season\u2019s Champions League final. The local rivals produced six goals in a frenetic first half and Everton had chances to have unnerved Liverpool before Georginio Wijnaldum inflicted a punishing fifth goal in the final minute. But overall the night served only to expose the widening chasm between the two clubs, a shift that commenced the moment Klopp walked through the door at Anfield and involves leadership off the pitch too. The Liverpool manager\u2019s century of league wins has arrived in 159 matches \u2013 quicker than any of his illustrious predecessors. Everton have managed 57 victories from their last 159 league games while squandering millions on average players and managers under Farhad Moshiri. David Moyes, or whoever the Everton hierarchy choose next, will inherit a squad without fight and mired in a relegation scrap. Xherdan Shaqiri was handed his first Premier League start of the season and Adam Lallana only his second as Klopp banked on both getting quickly up to speed with the intensity of a Merseyside derby. They did not disappoint on that score. Liverpool were dominant from the start, looking to release Man\u00e9 behind the wing-back Djibril Sidib\u00e9 at the earliest opportunity. Everton were uncertain, visibly so defensively, as their new-style back five looked to each other to track Origi\u2019s runs or Lallana\u2019s movement between the lines. Their collective failure to take responsibility led to a complete breakdown whenever Liverpool switched play from back to front and a horrendous opening for Silva. Man\u00e9 was irrepressible from the off and carved open the visiting defence with a glorious pass as Everton\u2019s first attack of the game resulted in Liverpool taking the lead. Lallana launched a counter-attack after an Everton move had broken down, taking Tom Davies out of the equation with a fine pass to Man\u00e9. What followed from the Senegal international was sublime. Scampering forward down the left he curled the perfect pass behind both Mason Holgate and Yerry Mina to release Origi through on goal. One touch took the striker beyond Jordan Pickford before he rolled his fourth Anfield derby goal into an empty Everton net. The visitors could not get to grips with Liverpool\u2019s ability to switch play or counter-attack with breathtaking speed. Man\u00e9 created the second too. Collecting Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s crossfield ball with an impudent touch, the forward cut in from the left and threaded another perfectly weighted pass into the path of Shaqiri. With Gylfi Sigurdsson failing to track his run the Switzerland international steered his finish wide of the exposed Pickford into the corner. Everton\u2019s response was exactly what was required, in fairness, as Alex Iwobi injected much-needed commitment and creativity into the visiting display. Michael Keane produced a polished finish, certainly by the standards of a central defender, when he pounced on Iwobi\u2019s low cross to lift the ball over Adri\u00e1n and half the deficit. Everton were suddenly dangerous but their lack of quality in attack was telling. Iwobi released Dominic Calvert-Lewin through on goal but the striker showed no conviction or pace and was bundled into a miscued shot by Virgil van Dijk. It was an important miss, as well as another moment when the England under-21 international went looking for a penalty or free-kick too readily. VAR agreed. Liverpool restored their two-goal cushion with criminal ease from an Everton perspective. A long ball down the centre from Dejan Lovren released Origi clear of the dawdling Keane. The striker killed the pass with a beautiful first touch and sent his second arching over the advancing Pickford. Man\u00e9 made it four when Everton were again undone by a Liverpool counter-attack. Alexander-Arnold led the charge against Davies and squared for Man\u00e9 to score with a precise finish from 18 yards. Silva had to instigate change and introduced Bernard for Sidib\u00e9 as Everton reverted to a 4-4-2. It paid off in first-half stoppage time when the Brazilian crossed for Richarlison to beat Adri\u00e1n with an attempted header, although the ball came off his shoulder. Everton showed more composure on the ball in the second half but remained a defensive shambles and the rout was confirmed when the substitute Roberto Firmino embarrassed Holgate before teeing up Wijnaldum for a low finish into the far corner. Man\u00e9 and the Everton substitute Moise Kean had squandered excellent chances before then. Silva departed without applauding the away section. A taxi awaits. l"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
