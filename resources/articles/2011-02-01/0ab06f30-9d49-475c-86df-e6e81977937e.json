A visit to Dubai or Malaysia for a training camp was the original intention, but Scotland's preference now is to have a five-day spell in Spain before returning to play Brazil. The friendly was discussed by the Scottish Football Association's board last Thursday. A contract with the agency looking to bring Brazil to Britain could be finalised in the next few days. Argentina, then under the guidance of Diego Maradona, travelled to Hampden Park for a friendly in 2008. The Brazil encounter would be even more notable, though, by taking place in England. The behaviour of Scottish supporters would be of particular interest, with the FA keen to stage an England v Scotland friendly at Wembley in 2013."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
