Scotland office minister George Foulkes is to present his case for an elected president of the council of ministers at a speech in Perth tomorrow. The president would be elected for a five-year term of office that can be renewed for one further five-year period, the minister will argue. Mr Foulkes, a member of the cross-party groups Britain in Europe and Scotland in Europe, will also advocate early entry to the single European currency. Mr Foulkes said today: \"It is important to give equal, if not more power and accountability to the council of ministers representing the national governments, and for that body to be headed by an elected president. \"I think that would help ensure that Europe has strong leadership, and that it is accountable to the national governments and not to the central bureaucracy. \"It means we could have an effective Europe without it being a superstate,\" he added. He did not rule out the possibility of prime minister Tony Blair being a future European president: \"That is certainly something that in the long-term is not beyond the bounds of possibility.\" The call comes after Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing, president of the European convention, last week promoted the idea of an elected EU president when he presented his carefully-balanced draft for a European Union constitution. Mr Giscrad said that there was a \"very broad consensus\" for having a European president and putting an end to the current six-month rotation system. Mr Foulkes said the post was intended as a counterweight to the power of the European Commission. He stressed that the European president would work alongside the presidents of both the commission and the EU parliament. \"Romano Prodi, as president of the Commission, is a powerful figure and the Commission is seen as a powerful body,\" Mr Foulkes said today. Foulkes' proposal forms part of a package of reforms, which also include the creation of a European parliament second chamber, made up of MPs from national parliaments. Other reforms comprise a written constitution for Europe, spelling out the proper levels of decision-making for particular issues, and early entry into the single currency. The president should also deliver an annual agenda, like the Queen's speech, outlining work for the coming year, Mr Foulkes added. He will tell tomorrow's meeting of the European movement: \"Although Europe should remain an association of sovereign states, we still need leadership, democracy and efficiency within our collective presence.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
