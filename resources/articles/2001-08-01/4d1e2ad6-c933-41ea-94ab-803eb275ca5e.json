Telling someone they have to learn is the kiss of death. The things we learn best are the things we want to learn. One child I know who thought he was hopeless at maths wanted a rabbit. His parents told him he could have the rabbit if he designed and built the hutch, which he did, using rulers and set squares, etc. This mother needs to look first at what her sons like to do. Boys often learn well by doing practical things. She could encourage them to explore their environment, whether country or urban. Perhaps invest in a cheap camera to put together a picture book on local buildings. Maybe they'd like their own little gardens, or perhaps they'd like to build a pond. If the family has a video camera, the boys could write a script, find locations and make an adventure video with their friends. If they like machinery there are living museums, which shouldn't be passive experiences, but ones in which they are encouraged to explore. Perhaps she could buy a cheap microscope - it doesn't have to cost a fortune - and there's an excellent new book called Explosive Experiments: Science With The Squishy Bits Left In by Nick Arnold (Hippo Books, \u00a37.99), which is a child-friendly introduction to science. She shouldn't supervise them too much, or say things aren't quite right, but let them learn on their own. All these kinds of activities can make an immense contribution to skills like researching, writing, developing logical sequences and so on. Dr David Lewis Psychologist specialising in learning and performance. \u0095 Summer holidays are great for the first two weeks, then the cry of \"I'm bored\" goes up. Kids don't like a complete absence of structure. I expect my son to keep a diary of just a couple of lines every day. A little writing at a regular time every day - perhaps before tea or bed - means that when they get back to school they don't have that huge 42-day gap since anyone asked them to sit down with a pencil and try to think. Perhaps they can put the entries in a nice folder and send them to a relative who's away or abroad, or to someone like a grandparent. There are some great websites for learning, and stacks of Cd-Roms you can borrow from the library. And each day there's a BBC a programme called Xchange - a Why Don't You for the 21st century - and an Xchange website www.bbc.co.uk/Xchange with plenty of games and things to do, many of which are science or nature based. Some of the activities involve exploring the neighbourhood and getting out and about. But it's also important for parents not to feel too guilty. There's nothing wrong with kids learning to cope with boredom on their own. You don't have to structure every day with activities and outings. An important part of the holiday is just having time for games, like football, or a walk in the park. Don't underestimate the joy of just having time to be. Karen Johnson Executive editor, BBC Education \u2022 Parents today are very conscious of the national curriculum and feel responsible for their children's education, which can be quite frightening. However, there are lots of things they can do to increase their children's confidence, which in turn will enhance their response to learning. Perhaps this mother could set her sons the task of preparing a meal that everyone will enjoy, including making a list and doing the shopping. If they need prompting, some simple ideas might be tuna pizza, baked potatoes, salad and knickerbocker glories. Children enjoy having a role in the home environment and like to have some purpose to the activity they're doing. Perhaps if you have a garden they could set up an obstacle course - while at the same time clearing out the garage! They could go to the library and look at the local authority website, which should have an events page. Local museums, galleries and zoos are increasingly laying on programmes during the summer holidays. The boys could bring home some craft books; children love making things and they could perhaps put on a puppet show for relatives or make gifts for relatives or friends. Parents need to plant ideas, give guidance and then help out with projects. They shouldn't criticise or take over - but taking an interest is crucial.

He has enjoyed nursery and most of the time is really looking forward to \"big school\", but sometimes first-day nerves take hold. Can you give me any hints on making his first day at school an easy transition? \u0095 Do you have a problem with your child's education? Is something bothering you about his or her school?
