It was impossible to black them out entirely, though, and during the day the sun would shine through tiny cracks and chinks in the window coverings. Years later, when the violence and anxiety of the war had subsided and only the ruins remained, Piene would say that when he dreamed about a better life, that better life was represented by the sun \u2013 seeing it, feeling it flood a room. Mattijs Visser, founder of the Zero Foundation, tells this story by way of explaining a work of Piene\u2019s, Pirouetten (Pirouettes in English). The artwork is a giant brass cube, about a metre along each edge, its sides peppered with holes in the pattern of suns and stars. It is strung up from the ceiling by one corner while a lamp turns slowly inside it, casting not shadows but moving patterns of light on the surfaces of the room. Piene called them \u201clight ballets\u201d, collaborating on them with composers including Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage. At the end of the war, nearly all the public buildings in D\u00fcsseldorf, Piene\u2019s hometown, were destroyed. In the late 1950s he joined with two other German artists who were also \u201clooking for the same light\u201d: Heinz Mack and G\u00fcnther Uecker. Over eight years they would pull into their orbit Yves Klein, Yayoi Kusama, Marcel Duchamp and more than 100 other artists whose work intersected or sympathised with their own. Zero, the artistic tendency that developed as a consequence \u2013 named for the point of beginning, the origin \u2013 was not simply about desiring a new kind of art, but a new kind of world. The Zero movement \u2013 or \u201cdynamic\u201d as Visser calls it \u2013 has slipped under the radar for many years but the past decade has seen a growing interest in the vision and works of those artists. In 2014 the Guggenheim staged a large retrospective, with the Stedelijk museum in Amsterdam following in 2015. And a new Zero exhibition is now showing at the Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Tasmania, coinciding with this year\u2019s Dark Mofo arts festival. Mona\u2019s exhibition might be a \u201cfiller\u201d \u2013 the originally scheduled artist pulled out just nine months ago \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t know it if Mona\u2019s founder, David Walsh, hadn\u2019t said so. The work feels remarkably contemporary for pieces created in the 1950s and 60s \u2013 the metallics, mirrors, careful use of light and stark simplicity of many of the works suit Mona\u2019s black walls and its underground aesthetic. There is a real democratic sensibility to many of the works. \u201cThey were strongly against \u2018the artist, his hand\u2019. They had to free themselves from this,\u201d Visser says. Sometimes this meant works were not transported for exhibition but rather recreated onsite by assistants or friends who would follow an artist\u2019s instructions using materials that were on hand. In one display at Mona, hundreds of identical plastic bags \u2013 the kind you might take a goldfish home in \u2013 are filled with water and pinned to the wall, illuminated by a spotlight in one corner. The installation was created with new materials by following instructions left by Hank Peeters. Sometimes it meant collaborative works. Visser gives the example of Lucio Fontana, who painted a canvas which he then sent to the Belgian artist Jef Verheyen, who painted over it before sending it to Hermann Goepfert in Frankfurt. Goepfert created a metal structure for the canvas before Verheyen came to Frankfurt to poke some holes in it. When works were sold, the funds were shared. \u201cThey didn\u2019t care who made it, who signed it, who produced it,\u201d says Visser. \u201cIf somebody could sell it, wonderful. He would put it in the pot and they would live from that.\u201d Many of the works at Mona require activation or movement from the viewer, such as Christian Megert\u2019s Spiegelenvironment (mirror environment), a curved wall of mirrors illuminated by spotlight. Depending on where you stand, you see yourself in every mirror \u2013 or in none. \u201cThere\u2019s a moment where you\u2019re completely blinded, so you open your eyes, and you start again, you start seeing again,\u201d Visser says. (This work would inspire Yayoi Kusama to create her own mirror rooms.) The artists used what was available to them \u2013 everyday objects such as wood, nails, matches and fabric. At the same time they were fascinated by newness and new materials \u2013 aluminium, plexiglass, plastic \u2013 and they wanted to throw off the shackles of artistic tradition. By using new materials, by pushing into performance, by getting away from the idea of art as an object you hang on the wall, Zero was paving the way for what we now call installation art. Mack and Piene would host themed exhibitions that would last for a single evening. They also published magazines that explored their ideas in more detail. They crossed borders \u2013 geographic and linguistic \u2013 creating connections with artists all around the world. And there were plenty of likeminded people: in Japan, a group that also called themselves Zero had started, completely independently, in 1953. There was also a Zero group in the Netherlands, founded also without any idea there were others doing so, in 1958 \u2013 the same year Mack and Piene were publishing their first Zero magazine. They had more than just a name in common: they also had a point of view. Mack wrote about the concept of \u201cresting restlessness\u201d \u2013 \u201cthis idea of art being something that wasn\u2019t static, something that broke boundaries,\u201d says the curator, Jane Clark. In G\u00fcnther Uecker\u2019s Lichtregen (light rain), slender aluminium poles hang from the ceiling, inserted with fluorescent globes. Lichtregen was intended to invoke the natural world but through a feeling rather than a direct representation. In Adolf Luther\u2019s bottle smashing room (in German, Flaschenzerschlagungsraum), participants hurl identical glass bottles at a metal plate set against a wall. When the bottle smashes, a flash of light bursts across the room, while the broken glass creates a mound against the wall. While the effect of the remnants has its own beauty, says Clark, the artwork is in the act of smashing. There weren\u2019t many galleries with an interest in Zero so the artists\u2019 ability to show their work depended on very practical things like a fast car and money for fuel, as well as works being either small enough to transport in the back seat, or simple enough to recreate anywhere. They also relied on likeminded people who would understand the spirit of what they were doing. \u201cOtto Piene was asked how many people were in the group or the movement,\u201d says Visser. \u201cHe said, it\u2019s not a group. It\u2019s not a movement. There\u2019s no precedent; there is no manifest; there is no dogma. There is a vision.\u201d The \u201cvision\u201d dissolved in 1966. The artists threw a party to farewell it. \u201cI think some of the reason they split up in the end was because actually their ideals, and their ideas, really diverged,\u201d Clark says. \u201cI think they were quite conscious that you can\u2019t push a good thing too long, it loses its energy.\u201d Visser founded the Zero Foundation in 2011, with those Zero artists who were still alive, to preserve and revitalise their work \u2013 and continue to experiment in their spirit. \u201cIf the artists would come here to the exhibition, they would say, \u2018Yeah, we would have done it in the same way.\u2019\u201d \u2022 Zero is at Mona in Hobart, Tasmania, until 22 April 2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
