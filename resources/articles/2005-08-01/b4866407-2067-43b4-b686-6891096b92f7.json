Once again yesterday he emerged from the slough of despond to play a leading role in England's effort to win a Test match and to reassert his much-disputed claim to be considered a vital member of Michael Vaughan's side. On Thursday he had compiled a tidy innings of 23 before getting his pads in the way of a delivery from Shane Warne, with whose guile his own relatively plain bowling has been unfavourably compared. Yesterday, enjoying the familiarity of a ground that has been his home for the past 13 years, he removed two of Australia's most dangerous batsmen at a time when each was looking set for a long stay, his successes helping to compensate for the opening bowlers' inability to capitalise on an early breakthrough. Then, for good measure, he accounted for Warne as Australia struggled to approach England's first innings total. Anyone who doubted the left-arm bowler's place in England's plans would have been interested to witness the reaction of his team-mates to the capture of the first of those wickets. The mass embrace in which Giles was instantly engulfed seemed to be staged with a special fervour, suggesting that the team wanted the rest of the world to see the value they place on his presence. It was only last summer that Giles found it necessary to consult England's psychologist, Steve Bull, in order to combat his own reaction to outside criticism. Bull's advice enabled him to come back so strongly that he finished the summer with 31 wickets against New Zealand and West Indies, a man of the match award at Lord's and the memory of knocking back Brian Lara's middle stump. All this won him a place as one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year, in the first clean sweep for English players since 1960. The acclaim made him feel, he remarked, as if the 2004 season represented \"the start of the rest of my career\". It must have been a particularly nasty shock, within weeks of seeing his portrait occupying a place of honour in the old primrose almanack, to discover himself facing a new prosecution on the very grounds that he thought he had demolished. In trying to restart the rest of his career, he came under even heavier fire. At the beginning of the week he was scorned for using his Guardian column to attack the suggestion that when he is on the team sheet, England might as well be taking the field with 10 men. The tone in which he couched his riposte laid him open to further charges of exhibiting self-pity. Yesterday, however, he found a much more effective way of putting his persecutors on the back foot. On a pitch providing not much more help to England's bowlers than it had offered the Australians a day earlier, Giles's steadiness became a valuable weapon once it became clear that the pace quartet would not exactly be tearing the opposition apart. In his five overs before lunch he took the wicket of Ricky Ponting, whose 61 had been compiled with ominous serenity. Trying to dink a decent delivery round the corner, Ponting got a top edge and saw the ball loop to Michael Vaughan at short fine leg. If another wicket in the innings matched Ponting's in importance, it was that of Michael Clarke. Six overs into his second spell early in the afternoon, Giles persuaded the 24-year-old into an injudicious swish that gave Geraint Jones a rare excuse for taking pride in his day's performance. Giles wheeled away from the City End for the remainder of the innings, knocking back Warne's off and middle stumps with one that spun out of the rough and concluding with three for 78 from 26 overs. In the end, Giles's reputation will be secured less by his individual exploits than through his membership of the team that restored England's cricketing self-respect. Perhaps the knowledge that he came into the professional game as a converted seam bowler militates against a wholehearted acceptance of his place among England's great slow left-arm bowlers, prompting a suspicion that he lacks the instinct and the bone-deep knowledge that underpinned the work of his memorable predecessors. Does he have the seething imagination of Tony Lock or the unrelenting aggression of Derek Underwood? Can he match the individual qualities of Johnny Wardle or Norman Gifford? But a comparison with less remote figures might be kinder and more instructive. If he cannot lay claim to the originality of Phil Edmonds, and if the ball does not linger on his fingertips as it did those of Philip Tufnell, he also lacks the mental frailty that prevented those two from realising their full potential in Test cricket. As the sun came out and Giles prepared to accept the congratulations for his contribution to a satisfying day for his team, only one cautionary thought intruded on a pleasant scene. If he could find enough in the pitch to take three wickets on the second day, what mayhem might Warne be ready to unleash in order to stifle England's attempt to square the series? Just ask Andrew Strauss, bowled by a magical delivery in the last over of the day. As Giles himself said this week, with an almost painful honesty, there is only one Shane Warne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
