Henry was again the inspiration behind a sublime Arsenal performance at Elland Road yesterday as Arsene Wenger's side began their defence of the FA Cup with a superb 4-1 third-round win over struggling Leeds. The Frenchman insists, however, that talk of trophies is premature. \"Last season, a lot of people were talking about us winning this and winning that and we only won the FA Cup,\" he said after the Gunners stretched their unbeaten run in the competition to 15 games. \"Let's keep our feet on the ground, enjoy it and see what we can do. But we are not trying to beat any records. \"We are far from another FA Cup final. We have a lot of stuff to focus on with the Premiership, then the Champions League and when the FA Cup comes around again we will focus on that.\" Henry scored the Gunners' equaliser - his 17th club goal this season - after Jens Lehmann had gifted Mark Viduka an eighth-minute opener, and then set up the second and third for Edu and Robert Pires. The quality of Arsenal's play was at times breathtaking as Leeds were carved open at will for all four goals, although the final scoreline was harsh on caretaker-boss Eddie Gray's side. Henry added: \"I've always said that as long as we play as a team then we can do well and that's what we are doing. At the moment people are talking about one, two or three players, but it's a team thing. Lehmann, meanwhile, is confident his error against Leeds will not affect him, but is grateful to his team-mates for sparing his blushes. \"I made the wrong decision, made a mistake and it was a freakish goal,\" he explained. \"Unfortunately it happens and I am very sorry about it. I said sorry to my team-mates in the dressing room at half-time, but they told me not to worry.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
