Her companion nods: \u201cWe need a government that can actually govern.\u201d Like most Spaniards, the pair, who do not want to give their names nor say how they would vote, are not relishing Sunday\u2019s general election \u2013 the country\u2019s fourth in as many years. \u201cI just feel fed up and defrauded,\u201d says the first woman. \u201cNone of the politicians here seems to get it. We can\u2019t go on like this. We can\u2019t go on with more and more problems and more and more unemployment. People keep saying things are getting better but they\u2019re not.\u201d The latest general election comes just seven months after the previous one, and fewer than six months after European, regional and municipal elections were held. Since the end of April, the country has been in the hands of the acting government of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, whose ruling Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) won the last election but failed to win a majority. The PSOE\u2019s attempts to form a government came to nothing after the centre-right Citizens party ruled out any form of co-operation, and efforts to make a deal with the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos also proved fruitless. S\u00e1nchez claims that his rivals\u2019 intransigence left him with no choice but to call another election. The timing, however, is far from ideal. The bitterly divisive question of Catalan independence re-erupted last month after Spain\u2019s supreme court jailed nine separatist leaders for sedition over their roles in the failed push for independence two years ago, prompting violent protests on the streets of Barcelona. The unrest was seized on by the parties of the Spanish right, who accused S\u00e1nchez of weakness in the face of such separatist provocation. It has proved a particular gift to the far-right Vox party, which has seen a surge in support amid its calls for a radical recentralisation of Spain. Polls suggest the party could now become the country\u2019s third largest political force after the PSOE and the socialists\u2019 traditional rival, the conservative People\u2019s party (PP). The Citizens party looks set to pay a high price for its decision to forfeit the centre ground and lurch to the right in the hope of competing with the PP and Vox. If recent polls prove accurate, the party will see its seat count tumble from 57 to 20 or fewer. To make matters worse, Spain\u2019s unemployment figures rose by almost 100,000 in October and the European commission has revised the country\u2019s growth forecast down from 2.3% to 1.9% for this year, and from 1.9% to 1.5% for 2020. Then there is the question of frustration and apathy. In April, turnout reached 75.5%, well up from the 69.8% of voters who headed to the polls in June 2016. Jos\u00e9 Pablo Ferr\u00e1ndiz, chief researcher for the polling firm Metroscopia, believes turnout will be somewhere around 70% on Sunday. In places such as Guadalajara, which lies an hour\u2019s drive north-east of Madrid in Castilla-La Mancha, Citizens\u2019 collapse could be Vox\u2019s triumph. Six months ago, the PSOE, the PP and Citizens each took one of the province\u2019s three seats, with the latter edging out Vox by fewer than 3,500 votes. \u201cIf you look at the map of the last election, the people scrapping over the last seat in many places were Citizens and Vox,\u201d said Ferr\u00e1ndiz. \u201cCitizens won them last time round, but the party\u2019s fall means that Vox won\u2019t need to pick up many more votes to take them.\u201d Although the PSOE are again expected to finish first, polls suggest they may lose some of the 123 seats they won in April. \u201cS\u00e1nchez thought he\u2019d keep the voters who supported him six months ago but also pick up some more from Citizens and so win a larger majority,\u201d said Ferr\u00e1ndiz. \u201cBut neither of those things appears to be happening. The battle is now between the other parties on the right \u2013 and abstention.\u201d In keeping with the growing political fragmentation of recent years, things are also growing crowded on the Spanish left, with the PSOE and Podemos now joined by M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds (More Country), a party led by \u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, one of the founders of Podemos. Whatever the result this weekend, negotiations to form a government promise to be as fraught and tortuous as last time, and a renewed impasse beckons. Despite the weariness though, Vox is not the only party looking forward to Sunday. The PP is expected to bounce back from its terrible showing in April, while the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) \u2013 the largest and most moderate of Catalonia\u2019s three pro-independence parties \u2013 is expected to finish first in the region and perhaps extend its lead over the Catalan branch of the socialist party. The ERC favours a less confrontational and more pragmatic approach to the quest for Catalan independence than Together for Catalonia, the separatist party led by the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont. The strategy appears to be paying off in a large chunk for the region \u2013 where many people are still furious over the supreme court\u2019s verdict. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019re the ones who can make more progress than anybody else because we keep our ideas but we have a plan to implement the republic, even if it\u2019s not magic and we\u2019re not saying that things can be done overnight,\u201d said Alfred Bosch, the ERC politician who serves as the region\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cPerhaps that looks more realistic and more appealing.\u201d Realism may abound in places such as Guadalajara, but political appeal is in rather shorter supply. Jes\u00fas Iglesias, a 49-year-old security guard from the city, lists his worries as he takes a cigarette break: pensions; the cost of renting; the situation in Catalonia, and what he sees as an excess of ineffectual publicly elected officials. \u201cWe need to get rid of the political old guard and get some new, young people in,\u201d he says. \u201cGiven the size of the country, we have far too many politicians and local councillors.\u201d Iglesias may also be \u201chasta el gorro\u201d, and torn between the PP and Citizens, but he knows he once again has a democratic duty to fulfil on Sunday. And besides: \u201cIf I don\u2019t vote, I can\u2019t complain.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
