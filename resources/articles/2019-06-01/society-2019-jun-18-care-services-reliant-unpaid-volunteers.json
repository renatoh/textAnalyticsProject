It morphs into self-righteousness", "bodyText": "Do-gooders, what do they know?\u201d Our geri-coterie were discussing how our care would be delivered. Charlie\u2019s surly remark was characteristically ungracious but he had a point. The voluntary sector has grown like Topsy both in numbers and in status, but its delivery of care to vulnerable people is seriously inefficient. Today, professional care services are disintegrating under the parsimony of austerity and are forced to outsource provision, specifying the same service for substantially less cost, which can only be achieved by dispensing with paid staff and employing volunteers instead. At the same time, the work itself has expanded with the proliferation of mental illness and lifestyle morbidity, dysfunctional families and disrupted homes, which all contributes to an epidemic of ill-being aggravated by enhanced longevity and junk diets. The traditional volunteer pool was women, grandparents and faith organisations, and it is drying up. The grandparental generation is now preoccupied with caring for grandchildren due to their own children\u2019s commitment to careers. Equally, women have jobs that rob them of time and energy to tidy up the national mess, scrub the public floor, dust the community furniture. As for faith systems, their holy communities are preoccupied with the repair of high-maintenance architectural white elephants, or focused on rapture in the hereafter. None are equipped to undertake the social gospel in the here and now. So the hungry are unfed and the imprisoned unvisited. And us crumblies undercared for. Put together, the new demands and the decline of its \u201cservice providers\u201d has created an inconvenient truth. The voluntary sector is no longer fit for its contemporary purpose. Besides, volunteers themselves are not easy creatures. We never have been. Managing us is akin to herding cats. Most of us are single-issue people, drawn to help causes with which we have a personal association, often through the loss of someone close or their suffering a particular misfortune. All of us commit unconditionally at first, but with time our initial altruism morphs into a distasteful mix of proprietorial self-righteousness, resentment and bickering. Trustees too are volunteers, who tend to be recruited from retired executives disappointed by loss of status. It is pretty unusual to come across any members of the voluntary top brass whose skill portfolio bears any resemblance to the task they volunteer to undertake. However the real ghost in the care machine is establishment indifference. Caring is not understood by an uber-class that had nannies, bedders to clean their university rooms at Cambridge and scouts to do the same at Oxford; it\u2019s a below stairs activity. They encourage and celebrate the volunteer as hero because it exempts them from any professional responsibility for the grubby business of incontinence and dementia. If the situation is to be retrieved, it requires the politicians to recognise that virtue is not its own reward; we all need structure and acknowledgment in our work, and it is the absence of both in the voluntary sector that\u2019s the cause of the crisis. Volunteers need positive feedback, and honeyed flattery doesn\u2019t cut the mustard. We need structure, job descriptions, and, yes, hierarchies, and operational incoherence doesn\u2019t deliver. Charlie was right. Of course there is a human responsibility to provide care, but duty of care requires a professional delivery. \u2022 Stewart Dakers is a 80-year-old community voluntary worker"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
