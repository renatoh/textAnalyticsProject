The FA is to investigate the incident after a member of Leeds\u2019 staff was seen acting suspiciously outside Derby\u2019s training ground on Thursday. The Leeds manager told Sky Sports: \u201cIt\u2019s true there was someone from Leeds. The responsibility for this is me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if this is legal, illegal, right or wrong. It\u2019s enough Frank Lampard and Derby felt it was not the right thing to do. I didn\u2019t behave well. I talked to Lampard and he told me I didn\u2019t respect fair play. I have a different point of view on it but the important thing is what Frank and Derby think. I am responsible for it because I didn\u2019t ask for permission to do it. \u201cWithout trying to find a justification, I have been using this kind of practice since the qualifications for the World Cup with Argentina. This is not illegal, we have been doing it publicly, we talk about it in the press. For some people it is the wrong thing, for others it\u2019s not.\u201d Lampard was irritated by what he called a disruption but acknowledged Bielsa\u2019s contrition. \u201cThat\u2019s good. He said the same to me, so I\u2019m pleased,\u201d said the Derby manager. \u201cOn a sporting level, it\u2019s bad, in my opinion. Talking about \u2018I did it somewhere else, it\u2019s fine\u2019 \u2013 that doesn\u2019t work for me. It\u2019s disrupted our preparations. Police had to come to the training ground, so that was disruptive. We were training on team tactics, shape, personnel and the fact that Harry Wilson wasn\u2019t training. \u201cHe\u2019s admitted it, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any further action but we had a guy in the bushes before we played Leeds earlier this season and we lost 4-1.\u201d Police confirmed officers were called to the training ground and a man was spoken to at the perimeter fence. No arrest was made. A statement read: \u201cOfficers conducted routine checks which were all above board. Despite media reports, no damage to the fence was found and the man was stopped outside the grounds. No arrests were made and the man was sent on his way.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino said the episode was not a surprise. The Tottenham manager played under Bielsa at Newell\u2019s Old Boys, Espanyol and Argentina. \u201cThere is nothing wrong to try to find information and know a bit more about what the opponents are doing. That happened 30 years ago in Argentina. Not only Marcelo, all the managers were like this,\u201d he said. \u201cHere maybe it is a little bit weird but in Argentina it happened. It is not a big issue or a big deal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
