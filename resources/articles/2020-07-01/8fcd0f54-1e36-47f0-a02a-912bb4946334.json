In addition to the statewide closures, the 30 counties on the state\u2019s monitoring list must also shut down indoor operations at places of worship, fitness centers, hair salons, barbershops and malls. California is contending with a rapidly growing caseload; the state has seen an average of 8,211 daily cases over the past week, an uptick from the 7,876 average from the week before. The positivity rate has increased to 7.4%, up from 6.1% a few weeks prior. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on all of us to recognize, soberly, that Covid-19 is not going away anytime soon,\u201d said Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor. \u201cWe were able to suppress the spread of this virus. We were able to knock down the growth of this at the beginning. We\u2019re going to do that again,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind. But at the same time, that can\u2019t happen without demanding something of you,\u201d he added, urging people to continue to wear masks and observe physical distancing. In total, California has reported more than 320,000 cases and 7,017 deaths. In the last 24 hours alone, 23 people have died from coronavirus, Newsom said. The move comes as cases nationwide top 3.3m, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tracker, meaning the country now accounts for about a quarter of all cases worldwide. More than 135,000 Americans have died of coronavirus. Florida, another state experiencing a major surge, reported 15,299 new cases on Sunday \u2013 the largest single-day rise of any state so far. Donald Trump continues to downplay the crisis and undermine public health experts, blaming the rising numbers on increased testing. On Monday the US president retweeted a claim that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is \u201clying\u201d about coronavirus. Last week California experienced its two deadliest days since the start of the pandemic, marking a particularly difficult period for a state that had been widely applauded for its early action in stemming the spread. Newsom\u2019s announcement on Monday came two weeks after he called for a similar shutdown for 19 of the state\u2019s hardest-hit counties, an order that affected 70% or the state\u2019s population. There are now 30 counties on the state\u2019s \u201cwatch list\u201d \u2013 regions where coronavirus is getting worse \u2013 prompting authorities to stall reopening statewide. The move comes as California\u2019s two largest school districts, Los Angeles and San Diego, announced classes would remain online-only throughout the fall semester. Trump responded to the announcement, saying he believed \u201cschools should be opened\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re losing a lot of lives by keeping things closed,\u201d he said. Newsom joins governors across the country who are rolling back reopening efforts. Earlier this month, Doug Ducey, Arizona\u2019s governor, and Greg Abbott, Texas\u2019s governor, ordered bars, nightclubs, gyms, movie theaters and water parks to close in their states. Abbott went a step further and ordered that residents wear masks in public, as Newsom has required Californians to do since mid-June. Meanwhile, Andrew Cuomo, New York\u2019s governor, announced on Monday that travelers coming from states with high levels of coronavirus spread must now provide their contact information to officials. Public health officials have narrowed down the sources behind the surges in each individual county, which are varied in demographics, industry and landscape. Los Angeles county, whose population makes up more than a quarter of the entire state, has been home to the largest number of coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, with public health officials attributing this in part to high levels of testing. Marin county, an affluent, mostly suburban county north of San Francisco, is experiencing elevated transmission and increased hospitalizations in part due to an outbreak at San Quentin state prison. Meanwhile, Imperial county, a small southern block of desert bordering Arizona with a population of 181,000, has seen an elevated transmission rate possibly linked to residents traveling to and from Mexico for work and healthcare, as well as from an outbreak at a meatpacking facility."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
