The service for the 41st president was attended by four former presidents and one current president: Donald Trump. \u2022Some lingering animosity was on show between Trump and Hillary Clinton, who he slammed during his presidential campaign and has continued to criticize his 2016 rival in office. \u2022George W Bush delivered a moving eulogy to his father. Bush Sr showed that \u201cone can serve with integrity and hold true\u201d to \u201cvalues like faith and family\u201d, his son said. \u2022In other news, former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is dropping out of the race to be the Democratic 2020 presidential nominee. He\u2019s the first major contender to do so. \u2022And one potential Democratic candidate continued flirting with a presidential bid. Michael Bloomberg went on a trip to Iowa to make friends, he said, and later promised to sell his company, or put it in a blind trust, if he runs. A little more on that man Michael Bloomberg \u2013 he has said if does run for president, which given his Iowa exploits seems likely \u2013 he would sell his massive company, or put it in a blind trust. It\u2019s a marked difference from Donald Trump, who did neither. Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump are running the company while their dad is president. Attorney generals from Washington DC and Maryland, and a number of federal agencies, began issuing subpoenas to the Trump Organization on Tuesday as they investigate whether payments made by foreign governments to Trump hotels violate the Constitution. Donald Trump\u2019s tariff wars have cost Nebraskan farmers more than $1bn in lost revenue, according to the Nebraska Farm Bureau. \u201cRetaliatory tariffs make our US products more expensive for international customers, meaning they buy less or buy from someplace else,\u201d Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson said in a press release. \u201cThis report provides a clear picture of how much we\u2019ve lost due to those tariffs and the need to improve our trade relations.\u201d On Monday Trump said farmers would benefit from his mooted, but shrouded, deal with China. Coal use in the US is expected to fall to the lowest level since 1979, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden reports that coal-fired power plants in the US have been shutting down as they are unable to compete with cheaper natural gas. \u201cIn 2007, there were 1,470 coal generators. By the end of 2017, there were 941,\u201d Emily writes. Coal plant retirements were highest in 2015, in part because of a rule regulating their mercury emissions, the government assessment said. US environmental regulators are planning to roll back those standards. The environmental protection agency later this week will also unveil a proposal to rescind standards for new coal plants to capture the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. But the change will not spur companies to build new coal plants, which are more expensive than natural gas plants and cause more pollution. Donald Trump promised to bring back coal-mining jobs during his presidential race. Democrats in the House of Representatives will push for stricter background tests on gun sales when Congress reconvenes in January. Mother Jones reports that Democrats plan to prioritize legislation that will require background checks on every gun sale. Currently private sales are not subjected to the FBI\u2019s National instant background check system. The legislation represents an aggressive shift in strategy by Democrats and their gun reform allies, who in previous years had tended to pursue more modest background check bills that would have exempted large numbers of gun purchases. The legislation will have at least some Republican support. GOP Rep Peter King, who previously introduced gun-control measures in conjunction with Democrat Mike Thompson, told Mother Jones he plans to support the bill. Deval Patrick, the former Democratic governor of Massachusetts, has pulled out of the 2020 presidential race. Patrick\u2019s decision, first reported by Politico, comes as something of a surprise given he hadn\u2019t announced he was running in the 2020 presidential race, and given the election is 699 days away. It may have been prompted by a Huffington Post article, published yesterday, which reported Patrick had made millions from relationships with companies accused of engaging in shady practices. Patrick, who has spent the past few months pootling round the country to support Democratic candidates, also went on to work for Bain Capital after leaving the Massachusetts capitol. Two elected Democrats have officially their candidacies for president: Rep John Delaney (who announced his campaign in July 2017), and Richard Ojeda, of the West Virginia State Senate. Michael Bloomberg, former New York City mayor, Bloomberg LP founder, and Big Gulp soda opponent, popped up in Iowa last night. Apparently Bloomberg was in the state to find out more about Iowans and as an opportunity to ask people who live there questions about their lives. If it seems strange that a man would travel across the country to a random state and start quizzing its residents, it shouldn\u2019t. Iowa is, of course, not a random state. It\u2019s the first in the nation to weigh in on Democratic presidential candidates. And Bloomberg is \u201cconsidering\u201d being one of those candidates. Bloomberg was coquettish when asked if he was running for president, according to ABC 7. \u201cI do think that after 12 years in City Hall, dealing with international problems and security problems and economic problems and creating jobs and the environment and guns and women\u2019s rights and tobacco and these things, that I have a lot of experience which would be useful if I was President of the United States,\u201d said Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say something, it\u2019s a different thing to have actually done it.\u201d If elected Bloomberg would become the first person who is definitely a billionaire to be president of the United States. The intrigue over the still undecided election in North Carolina\u2019s ninth congressional district is still continuing. The North Carolina board of elections has refused to verify Republican Mark Harris\u2019s victory in the district amid allegations of fraudulent activities related to absentee by-mail ballots. Harris finished ahead of Democrat Dan McReady by just 905 votes in the November mid-terms. But since then people have come forward saying they were paid to collect absentee ballots \u2013 which is illegal \u2013 by a political operative connected to Harris\u2019s campaign. Absentee ballots have to be signed by a witness \u2013 usually a family member or friend. But on Tuesday CNN reported that of a set of 161 ballots it had obtained from the ninth district, the same nine people had signed at least 10 absentee ballots each. Many of those nine people who signed ballots seem to know each other, checks of public records and their social media accounts showed. Some are also associates of Leslie McCrae Dowless, a longtime North Carolina operative who worked for the campaign of Mark Harris, the Republican who leads the race by 905 votes. A CNN review found three witnesses signed more than 40 ballots each, another signed 30, and three other people signed more than 10 apiece. North Carolina election law states only the voter or a near relative can hand in an absentee ballot. A line from George W Bush\u2019s speech that could have been meant for a certain person in the audience... Bush said of his father: \u201cShowed me what it means to be a president who serves with integrity, leads with courage, and acts with love in his heart for the citizens of our country.\u201d George H W Bush\u2019s body is now bound for Texas, before a service there on Thursday. We\u2019ll switch our focus to the rest of the day\u2019s political developments. Our Washington bureau chief David Smith has this news wrap of the funeral: George W Bush has just given a eulogy at George H W Bush\u2019s funeral service. Bush Jr describes a man full of vigor, even into old age. His father \u201cwas born with just two settings\u201d, Bush says: \u201cfull throttle then sleep\u201d. \u201cAn empathetic man, he valued character over pedigree,\u201d Bush says of his father. He showed that \u201cone can serve with integrity and hold true\u201d to \u201cvalues like faith and family\u201d. \u201cIn victory he shared credit when he lost he shouldered the blame,\u201d Bush says. He says history will remember H W Bush well. \u201cThey will say that george H W Bush was a great president of the United States. A diplomat of unmatched skill,\u201d Bush says, as well as a man who served \u201cwith dignity and honor\u201d. Bush tears up as he ends by saying the 41st president was: \u201cThe best father a son or daughter could have.\u201d Earlier, presidential historian John Meacham, had remembered George H W Bush during his own eulogy. \u201cHis life code, as he said, was tell the truth, don\u2019t blame people....to choose the right over the convenient, to hope rather than to fear, and to heed not our worst impulses,\u201d Meecham said, as Donald Trump looked on. As the funeral continues, a report has emerged that Donald Trump is ignoring concerns over the soaring national debt, because he won\u2019t be in office once it becomes untenable. According to the Daily Beast aides have sat Trump down to explain to the president how the national debt is likely to have a \u201chockey stick\u201d spike in the future. Trump\u2019s response, according to Daily Beast sources? \u201cYeah, but I won\u2019t be here.\u201d The episode illustrates the extent of the president\u2019s ambivalence towards tackling an issue that has previously animated the Republican Party from the days of Ronald Reagan to the presidency of Barack Obama. But for those who have worked with Trump, it was par for the course. Several people close to the president, both within and outside his administration, confirmed that the national debt has never bothered him in a truly meaningful way, despite his public lip service. \u201cI never once heard him talk about the debt,\u201d one former senior White House official attested. Here\u2019s Donald Trump arriving at Bush\u2019s funeral. He and Hillary Clinton \u2013 and Bill Clinton \u2013 fail to acknowledge one another, while Melania Trump shook Bill Clinton\u2019s hand and waved to the former first-lady. A nice little thing that happened just now \u2013 George W Bush slipping Michelle Obama what was apparently a piece of candy. The pair are known to be friendly, and Bush did the same thing earlier this year at John McCain\u2019s funeral in a moment that went viral on the internet. Current and former leaders are in place at the National Cathedral for Bush\u2019s funeral. And here is George W Bush and family outside the Capitol earlier. The 41st president has been remembered fondly in the media \u2013 particularly in the American media \u2013 over the past few days. Many have praised Bush Sr\u2019s warmth and diplomacy, comparisons which seem particularly pertinent given Donald Trump\u2019s convention-defying approach to the presidency. While Bush undoubtedly deserves praise for his decades of public service, and he has been credited with steering the US and aiding Europe as the Soviet Union collapsed. But the eulogizing has struck a discordant tone with many. While respecting Bush and his family, it would be remiss to ignore the dog whistling of Bush\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign and his inaction in the midst of the Aids crisis. George H W Bush\u2019s body has arrived at the United States Capitol ahead of his funeral. His casket will now be escorted to the National Cathedral, where the funeral service will begin at 11am. Bush\u2019s body was flown to Washington DC from Houston, Texas, on Sunday, where he has been lying in the Capitol Rotunda. After the funeral today his remains will be flown back to Houston for a service on Thursday. He will then be mounted onto a train which will carry him 70 miles to College Station, where Bush will be buried at George the H W Bush Presidential Library. The Bush family arrived earlier to attend the arrival of the former president. The Republican-controlled Wisconsin state senate passed sweeping bills this morning designed to weaken the powers of the incoming Democratic governor. Ignoring days of protests at the Capitol building, in Madison, the GOP rushed through the legislation just before dawn. The bills would require the approval of the state Senate and House \u2013 which will still be Republican-controlled in the next session \u2013 before Michigan\u2019s new governor, Tony Evers, can make changes to work and drug-testing programs or redirect funds for highway programs. One of Evers\u2019 key campaign promises was improving the quality of Wisconsin\u2019s roads. He also pledged to repeal laws which allowed the state to drug test food stamp recipients. Michigan Republicans have been weighing similar action ahead of the state\u2019s incoming Democratic governor. The big news overnight, of course, was that Robert Mueller has recommended Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, should not serve any prison time. Mueller made the request in a heavily redacted court filing on Tuesday. We learnt that Flynn has participated in 19 interviews and provided investigators with documents and communications and given first-hand accounts of \u201cinteractions between individuals in the presidential transition team and Russia. We\u2019re yet to hear Donald Trump\u2019s views on the developments. On Monday experts said Trump\u2019s praise for Roger Stone \u2013 Trump said his longtime adviser has \u201cguts\u201d for apparently saying he won\u2019t testify \u2013 could amount to witness tampering. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of goings on in Washington and around the country. The state funeral of former president George H W Bush will take place today. The 41st commander-in-chief will be remembered at Washington National Cathedral from 11am, with his son, 43rd president George W Bush, among those who will deliver eulogies. Former presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter will attend the ceremony, as will Donald Trump and the first-lady Melania Trump. German chancellor Angela Merkel, Prince Charles and former UK prime minister Sir John Major are also in Washington DC. Donald Trump announced this morning that the funeral service is not a funeral, but instead a \u201cday of celebration\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
