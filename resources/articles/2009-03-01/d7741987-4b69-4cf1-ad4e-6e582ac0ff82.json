Sbragia was appointed only in December following Roy Keane's sudden exit but has been warned by Quinn that he still has to prove he is the right man for the job long-term with the American investor Ellis Short poised to take a controlling interest in the club in the summer. The former first-team coach understands the pressure he is under with nine games left to play and is confident he will retain his job as long as he keeps Sunderland, who are three points above the relegation places and play Manchester City on Sunday, in the Premier League. \"There is always pressure on the manager,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter where you are in the league, we have to be successful and we live and die on results. You are always on trial, it is not any different. We know what we have to do. \"My main focus is staying up and then I have a lot of things on my mind and things I want to change, but that can't be done unless we are in the Premier League. I have a plan of how I want to work it and the players, or type of players, I want to bring in. I am here for the long haul, if we stay up.\" Relegation would be a huge blow for Sunderland although, according to Quinn, it would not be a catastrophe economically because every player has a clause in their contract which reduces their wages by 40% if they fall into the Championship. \"Obviously some players won't come down with us, and their agents won't let them, but for us as a business it wouldn't be catastrophic,\" the chairman said. \"It would be catastrophic for morale and fans but we'd still be in better shape than when we took over when we were in the Championship.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
