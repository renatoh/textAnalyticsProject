You can hear it in his voice over the phone from Jutland. Like every other fur farmer in Denmark, he has 10 days to kill his mink. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s dawned on me how grave the consequences will be for us. We are shellshocked. I was up at 4am because I couldn\u2019t sleep. I\u2019ve been pacing up and down the floor, and I\u2019ve cried. It\u2019s a state of shock,\u201d said Paps\u00f8, who has more 30,000 mink on his farm. On Wednesday the Danish government announced a cull of every mink in the country over fears that a Covid-19 mutation moving from mink to humans could jeopardise future vaccines. A new strain, currently known as the Covid-19 mink variant, is already circulating among the Danish human population, and 214 people are known to have been infected. \u201cIf we don\u2019t [cull them] the government will send police or even military, we\u2019ve been told,\u201d Paps\u00f8 told the Guardian. For Paps\u00f8 and his wife, the cull will be the end of 30 years\u2019 work. \u201cOur business is destroyed now. It was bad already as 90% is from China. A lot of them travel here to buy the fur. They couldn\u2019t do that when Covid hit. And now this,\u201d he said. Given the scale of Denmark\u2019s nationwide cull, which includes breeding stock, it could be a while before fur producers think beyond it. Although so far no official ban has been imposed, on Wednesday a statement from the Danish police said: \u201cNo minks will be allowed in the cages in 2021.\u201d Paps\u00f8 said the restrictions are likely to shut down the sector. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s 99% certain the industry will not come back from this,\u201d he said, despite the fact that Denmark\u2019s mink quality can earn farmers a 40% premium compared with other countries. A spokesperson for industry lobby Fur Europe suggested that some mink farmers might now go overseas. \u201cIf they are thinking about the future at all right now, Danish farmers might be thinking about leaving,\u201d Nick Madsen said. \u201cIn the past, fur farmers from Denmark have relocated to North America or eastern Europe. There are questions over Poland [due to a potential fur farm ban], but Bulgaria might be attractive.\u201d Describing the cull process, Paps\u00f8 said the mink are \u201cmoved from their nest into a small box. In that box there is CO2-gas. That sedates them, and they fall asleep are gone in 10-15 seconds. It\u2019s as humane as you can do it, there is no transport as with other livestock and no stress from that.\u201d But animal welfare organisations disagree. Wendy Higgins of the Humane Society International (HSI) said gassing is \u201cparticularly cruel because mink are semi-aquatic animals able to hold their breath for long periods\u201d, which means that some could survive the first attempt. \u201cIn the Netherlands there was video of mink culls that appears to show some mink surviving initial gassing and having to be gassed a second time,\u201d Higgins said. The order to cull mink has fuelled debate about the future of fur. Birgitte Damm, policy adviser and vet with NGO Animal Protection Denmark, said the Danish cull was the end for fur. \u201cThe corona pandemic showed us that the time when thousands upon thousands of animals could be crammed into tiny spaces is over. The animals are suffering and the farms are breeding grounds for new diseases. The future holds no minks in tiny cages, not in Denmark, not anywhere.\u201d Globally, Higgins said data from the world\u2019s largest auctioneers, Kopenhagen Fur, showed a long-term decline in mink prices, from \u20ac59 (\u00a353) per pelt in December 2013, to \u20ac19 in September 2020. \u201cThere\u2019s no question, the fur trade has been in decline for a while, but the past year has seen a perfect storm of events,\u201d she said. \u201cTop designers have been dropping fur in droves because it\u2019s jarringly outdated as well as cruel. Consumers increasingly want high animal welfare, environmentally-friendly products, which fur is not.\u201d Recent undercover investigations in Asia and Europe showing foxes skinned alive, mink eating each other, and paralysed mink with rotting back legs, have also lowered demand. Madsen and the Finnish CEO of Saga Fur auctioneers, Magnus Ljung, both see it differently. They point to a jump in Chinese demand following news of the Danish cull and expect further price rises. Some Danish pelts from Covid-19 free farms will make it to market, Madsen added. \u201cThe farm has to be outside the (7.8km) security zone around infected farms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe estimate 4 million to 5 million [pelts] will be destroyed around 7 million will reach the auction house next month.\u201d Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.
