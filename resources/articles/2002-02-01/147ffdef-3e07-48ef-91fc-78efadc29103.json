The new village, on the site of a former railway goods yard in the centre of St Austell in Cornwall, will mix housing, shops, businesses and public spaces - including a village green. As with Poundbury, which was nicknamed Charlesville, the streets of the planned Cornish village have been designed in the style of a traditional village or market town. Like Poundbury the layout has also been designed primarily for pedestrians rather than cars, with an emphasis on reducing vehicle speed. Poundbury has featured in a government guide to improving the design of housing estates, but it's design angered architects for its conservatism. The architect and former regeneration adviser to the government, Lord Rogers, described it as a \"questionable exercise in Hardeyesque nostaligia\". The Prince's Foundation - which promotes a return to human values in architecture, urban design and regeneration - has been working with the partners involved in the Cornish scheme. It is understood that the prince, who is also the Duke of Cornwall, is taking a close personal interest in the project, and it is likely he will make a visit later this year. The project is a partnership between Restormel borough council, the South West regional development agency, Devon and Cornwall Housing Association, the developer Midas Homes, and the Prince's Foundation. The St Austell urban village meets the government policy on maximising the use of derelict land to include affordable housing and a range of employment and community facilities. Subject to planning permission, the urban village will feature around 140 dwellings, comprising a mixture of two bedroom flats, and two, three and four bedroom houses. The Prince's Foundation is working with all the project partners to ensure the development reflects urban village principles. \"We see this flagship scheme as a pilot for good practice in the development of brownfield sites in the borough and Cornwall,\" said Restormel council spokeswoman Shirley Polmounter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
