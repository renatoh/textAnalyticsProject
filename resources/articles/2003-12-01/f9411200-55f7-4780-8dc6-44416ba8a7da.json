However, for those entirely devoid of plumptious thought or tingling inspiration, you may be relieved to hear that a stupidly expensive Christmas gift is often greeted just as warmly. A personalised Miller Harris perfume, say - a snip at a mere two grand. Or perhaps a handsome tub of La Prairie Skin Caviar, with its own little runcible spoon? And really now, who could resist a jar of Cr\u00e8me de la Mer's super-swelegant face cream, especially when the silver lid is engraved with your very own initials? Admittedly, a Diptyque candle for every month of the year does smell a little of Christmas Eve desperation. Fortunately, it also smells of Mexican orange blossom, so everyone's a winner. Tip: do be sure to ask the shop assistant to leave the price tag on now, won't you?
