During the day, he studied literature at Brooklyn College and worked in a cafe. At night, he stayed up writing poems. It wasn\u2019t just the sense of isolation that comes from being the only one awake, when \u201cyou look out of the window and it\u2019s completely dark and you\u2019re at sea in this little ship\u201d. It was more that writing in the off-hours relaxed his knack for self-criticism. \u201cYou get the last word of the day,\u201d he says. \u201cThe editor in your head \u2013 the nagging, insecure, worrisome social editor \u2013 starts to retire. When that editor falls asleep, I get to do what I want. The cat\u2019s out to play.\u201d The poems that came out of those night-time efforts were published in 2016 as Night Sky With Exit Wounds, the success of which still amazes the author \u2013 the book won a Whiting award that year, and in 2017 scooped both the Forward prize and the TS Eliot prize. Vuong, who is 30, was not from a background from which writers traditionally emerge. As a two-year-old, he had been brought to the US from Vietnam as a refugee and settled with his family in the working-class town of Hartford, Connecticut. No one in his family spoke English. When his father left, his mother got work in a nail salon, menial work for little reward and a quality of life that Vuong had no particular expectation of exceeding. If Night Sky tackled the absent father as myth, then his debut novel, On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous, reckons with the mother and grandmother who raised him and it is the influence of these women \u2013 courageous, difficult, devastated by the ripple effect of the Vietnam war \u2013 that forms the spine of the novel and asks the central question: after trauma, how do we love? We are in Vuong\u2019s open-plan living room in Northampton, Massachusetts, a leafy college town where he teaches creative writing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Peter, his partner of 10 years, has taken the dog out. Vuong is slight, with a silver earring in one ear and the habit of pushing his tortoiseshell glasses up his nose. He speaks, as he writes, in poetic imagery, what he calls \u201cthe metaphor as autobiography of the gaze\u201d. In the novel, the world seen through a speeding car window \u201csurges by like sidewise gravity\u201d. A bird on a windowsill appears not as a bucolic symbol but \u201ca charred pear\u201d. To Little Dog, the protagonist \u2013 so named by his family to protect him beneath a cloak of worthlessness \u2013 the world is an ugly place, in which beauty is made more so for the improbability of existing at all. \u201cFreedom,\u201d he says, \u201cis nothing but the distance between the hunter and its prey.\u201d That On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous is one of the most anticipated novels of the year \u2013 the novelist Max Porter has called it \u201cstaggeringly beautiful\u201d, observing that \u201cit seems obvious now that a gay young poet born in Saigon would write the great American novel\u201d \u2013 is, in large part, down to its perfect engineering, a piece of autobiographical fiction that avoids all the traps of that genre. It is fluid, moving the way thought moves, in circles not lines, and written in the form of a letter to Little Dog\u2019s mother that he knows she\u2019ll never read. It is easy to imagine a bad version of this novel in which any one of its preoccupations might have overgrown to capsize it. It might have been the Opioid Novel, or the Vietnam Novel, or the Exploitative World of the Nail Salon novel. It might have been the Gay Adolescent Love novel or the Violent Childhood novel, all themes that are touched upon lightly while still assuming a fully weighted presence in the narrative. How Vuong does this is a mystery, as is the seamlessness with which he moves between scenes of violence in the Vietnam war to scenes of violence in the home in Connecticut, to love scenes with a doomed boy called Trevor. The book has a poetic density that is at once elliptical and unflinching in its gaze, a testimony to the endlessly complicated dynamics of damage. \u201cSometimes being offered tenderness,\u201d writes Vuong, \u201cfeels like the very proof that you\u2019ve been ruined.\u201d Vuong grew up in a world in which he was marginalised across every axis \u2013 class, race, sexuality. His was a violent household. In a memoir piece he wrote for the New Yorker two years ago, which would form the basis of many scenes in the novel, Vuong, addressing his mother, recalled \u201cthe time you hit me with the remote control. A bruise I would lie about to my teachers. I fell playing tag.\u201d And,\u201cthe time you threw the box of Legos at my head. The hardwood dotted with blood.\u201d And, \u201cthe time with a gallon of milk. A shattering on the side of my head, then the steady white rain on the kitchen tiles.\u201d Post-traumatic stress disorder was something no one had any idea about at the time, \u201cexcept in veterans\u201d. But there is no question, looking back, that both his grandmother, who saw her village in Vietnam razed by US soldiers, and his mother, ripped from everything familiar for a new life in the US, where her husband beat her before leaving, were suffering from PTSD. Violence was the ugly expression of this trauma, but with distance, Vuong could see a positive release of that energy, too \u2013 chiefly in the way that his mother and grandmother told stories. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this until I talked to other Vietnamese-Americans \u2013 that it was rare for families to talk about the war,\u201d he says. Partly it came out of boredom. They were broke, stuck in the house with each other and \u201cwe had no TV\u201d. But there was something else going on, too. \u201cThe stories, at first, were folklore. My grandmother would tell a ghost story, then she would say: oh, that was after the napalm. So through cycles of these stories, that world started opening and as a child I would ask: what\u2019s napalm? They ploughed on. It was almost intoxicating for them to create a mythology of their lives, because they were so powerless. They were all women. The men were gone; they did their harm and were gone. And they were empty hands, had no English, were powerless everywhere else. But when it was time to tell the story, they held everything.\u201d Vuong had no context for what he was hearing. He only knew that in the stories, these women who counted for nothing outside, ran through the fire and survived. \u201cThey turned themselves into myths and it had a rhetorical power. They turned themselves into the Odyssey.\u201d In the novel, the trauma of Little Dog\u2019s mother and grandmother shines through in grimly humorous ways. Lan, the grandmother, yelling at his addled mother to get back in the car, shouts to get through to her, \u201cget back in the helicopter\u201d. Buying a dress from the Salvation Army, his mother asks Little Dog to read the label and find out, \u201cis it fireproof?\u201d In the family mythology, Vuong was the single last hope of these indestructible women and when, in the mid-2000s, Hartford was hit by the opioid epidemic, it\u2019s the thing that stopped him from leaning towards drugs. \u201cA lot of my friends were dying. And I thought: OK, I can die.\u201d Worn out by poverty, bullying, bereavement and violence, he regarded this outcome as regrettable, but \u201cI think that might not have been enough, were it not for me being my family \u2019s only hope. Because they were also dying, in a different way: financially, mentally. And I thought, I can\u2019t die. Literally I can\u2019t die.\u201d He wanted to change his family\u2019s story. He wanted to make his mother happy. He wanted to exceed the expectations of someone born to his station in life. So what did he do? He smiles. \u201cI went to business school.\u201d There was a year in early adulthood when Vuong and his mother didn\u2019t speak. He knew life had been hard for her, leaving Vietnam and dealing with his father, about whom he knows very little other than that after his mother kicked him out, he \u201cwent off to do criminal things and ended up going to jail\u201d. But he hadn\u2019t yet got to the stage of forgiving her. \u201cIt was the worst, for both of us,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when we looked at each other again, we just sobbed and said: oh, we can\u2019t do that. We\u2019ve got to find a way.\u201d This happened before Vuong had written a single line, and it was important; \u201ca pivotal moment to understand that anger destroys, not only those around you, but especially yourself. Anger is energy \u2013 you can get a lot done with anger; you can write multiple books. We\u2019ve read those books and you realise as you\u2019re reading them: oh, this is not for me. It\u2019s their own project. So I didn\u2019t want to write angry. I didn\u2019t want to be angry. I saw what anger did, growing up, and it was powerful, a force to be reckoned with, but it didn\u2019t lead to anywhere that I was interested in going.\u201d This isn\u2019t the received wisdom among many of those applying to study creative writing at college, where it is sometimes assumed that having something to rage about is a definite advantage. After eight weeks at business school \u2013 which he characterises as \u201clearning to lie\u201d \u2013 Vuong dropped out and enrolled to read literature at Brooklyn College. He started to write poetry. And then he had an unsettling experience. Freshly arrived in New York, he turned up at a poetry reading one night, pretty sure he was about to \u201cmeet my people\u201d, having spent the previous two decades as a fish out of water. \u201cAnd the first thing someone said to me was: hey, I\u2019m at Sarah Lawrence, where are you studying? And I said: oh, I\u2019m not in an MFA [master of fine arts]. And he just turned around and walked off.\u201d He bursts out laughing. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d Another student on a prestigious writing programme chatted to Vuong for a few moments, before saying: \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky \u2013 you\u2019re gay and from war.\u201d The idea of Vuong\u2019s childhood as a generator of great material for fiction is one that makes him laugh like a drain. These days, if any of his upper-middle-class students grouse that they don\u2019t have a good backstory, he mildly points out that Virginia Woolf got one of the best novels ever written out of someone basically crossing a lawn. At the time, however, he was shocked and disappointed. He hadn\u2019t been prepared for the merciless competition of the New York poetry crowd \u201cwhich depended on appearances, soirees and parties. So I just holed up in my apartment and the library.\u201d His confidence cratered. He wondered if he\u2019d made a terrible mistake. Then he hit upon an unexpected remedy. \u201cA huge moment in my education as a writer was reading biographies. I beg my students to do it, because everything that they\u2019re feeling, Sylvia Plath felt 70 years ago. And Ginsburg and Lorca and Rimbaud. There\u2019s Virginia Woolf, this genius, who\u2019s going on a crisis walk. You read the prose and you would never think this woman has any doubt. And yet here she is, out there, asking: what am I doing?\u201d Vuong thinks he was lucky in some ways. \u201cI had no pressure. I could really experiment with my voice. I could play, and find pleasure in it. I see with my students that they\u2019re under a lot of pressure from their families. A parent will say to me: \u201cmy future Pulitzer winner!\u201d and I just groan. Poor kid. What do you say to that?\u201d He started going to open mic poetry events, which were shabbier and more democratic than formal readings, and at one of which he met a law student called Peter. To that point, Vuong\u2019s relationships had been largely dysfunctional, \u201cbad, bad relationships in almost this cliched trope of seeing what\u2019s familiar in violent, self-destructive folks\u201d. His horizons had been limited in other ways, too. It is an odd side-effect of poverty that you become trapped in a previous era, he says; new things take longer to arrive, and when they do, no one has time to absorb them. \u201cYou don\u2019t have no time. That\u2019s the thing everybody in my community says: I ain\u2019t got no time for that!\u201d He laughs. \u201cBeing poor is about waiting, I learned. You\u2019re waiting in line for welfare. You go to the ER, you wait. You want to file for sexual assault? You wait. And so everybody\u2019s in a queue and one thing that happens is that you\u2019re in a cultural time warp. You\u2019re in the past. So when I went to New York in 2007, I had no iPhone, no Facebook; in my community, when it comes to technology and access, they are mostly in the late 90s.\u201d They were also culturally fairly regressive, although in his own home at least, homophobia was one of Vuong\u2019s lesser problems. (There is a heartbreaking bit in the novel in which Little Dog wakes to find \u201cFAG4LIFE\u201d scrawled on his family\u2019s front door in red paint and he tells his mum that it reads: \u201cMerry Christmas, Ma. See? That\u2019s why it\u2019s red. For luck.\u201d) When he was growing up, his mother and grandmother weren\u2019t thrilled by his sexuality, but \u201cbecause they came from a long line of rice farmers, they were close to native traditions in Vietnam, and those communities had intersex folks who were seen as having all-seeing power. They were powerful people and there was a mysticism associated with that. That doesn\u2019t mean they hoped their children would be queer. But although they were shocked, they had a very practical way of looking at things. That\u2019s what I admired about them. Their view is that this is borrowed time. We should\u2019ve been gone up in smoke. But now we\u2019re here, let\u2019s just live.\u201d The downside to this attitude was economic ruin. \u201cIt leads to financial woes and bankruptcy. Maxed-out credit cards.\u201d He\u2019s laughing now. \u201cOK, after 20 years, the party\u2019s over! Let\u2019s think about savings! They\u2019re all in financial ruts because they had that mentality.\u201d It was a joyfulness, or at least a somewhat constructive outlook, that Vuong associates with women who emerge from trauma as opposed to destructive and self-destructing men. It still amazes him, looking back, how the women in his family \u2013 his mother, his grandmother, his aunts \u2013 dealt with the threat of their husbands. \u201cThe incredible thing that I can never quite understand was how they were able to kick them all out. The men had access to jobs, money, a patriarchal presence in the world, and even though they had troubles too, as immigrants and refugees, we come from a patriarchal tradition in the old country just as deeply rooted as in the west. In some cases, when men are talking to each other, women aren\u2019t supposed to even be in the room. So that was what they were coming out of. And to think divorce?! These things were still taboo where they came from. And they all really did it.\u201d The question of courage underlines everything Vuong writes, both in terms of the characters and in the nerve held by the writer creating them. Night Sky With Exit Wounds, published when he was 27, and which \u201ctook off in ways that no poet ever suspects will happen, and should not expect again\u201d, dared to imagine scenes in which brutality and sensuality combined. (In one scene, the poet describes his father masturbating in a bathroom after he has beaten his mother, observing \u201cthat a man in climax is the closest thing to surrender\u201d.) The novel has a similarly shocking breadth of sympathies. In both, Vuong\u2019s ultimate aim was to dignify the experiences of his childhood with the solemn, years-long gaze of the novelist. \u201cThe great male writers of the European tradition, be it Proust, Tolstoy, Turgenev, deemed that those most inspiring to them existed in a white aristocracy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou read those books and you wouldn\u2019t even know that people of colour existed in Europe. To each his own, and that was their choice. But I wanted to say: these lives, of women, and even of poor white people \u2013 these lives are worthy of literature. As Turgenev looked at the crumbling Russian empire, I look at these folks in a different crumbling empire and deemed that these are inspiring lives to an artist.\u201d He also wanted to say something about where the cost of war falls, not from the vantage point of the grand historical epic, but from inside the small, cramped sadness of a house still flattened decades after the conflict has ended. \u201cIt\u2019s the stories of our species that men create these wars and women clean them up. They clean them up emotionally, they have to deal with the PTSD that comes home, they have to postpone their own healing, forgo their own self-care, in order to hold these households together. They literally nurse these broken bodies back to health. I wanted a book to honour that without romanticising it. To say women have been doing this and they\u2019re not necessarily these heroic legends. What\u2019s the mental cost of the women who do these extraordinary things? In the book, the cost is their own private life.\u201d A few months ago, Vuong\u2019s mother was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and he has been commuting back and forth to Hartford to accompany her to chemotherapy. After a dire admission to hospital, during which, he says, she was in so much pain \u201cit sounded like warfare and I was ready to bury her\u201d, she is responding to treatment and even hopes to come to his book launch. He thinks of something she said to him when he first left for New York. \u201cShe told me: it\u2019s OK for people to think you\u2019re a fool.\u201d Vuong laughed and said: \u201cReally? Why?\u201d and his mother replied: \u201cBecause then they\u2019ll tell you everything about them. You can see them from all their angles.\u201d It\u2019s the wisdom of his life. The subversive power of being \u201ca small, queer, person of colour\u201d is that Vuong has the ability to see everything. He smiles. \u201cNobody hides themselves from a fool.\u201d \u2022 On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a312.99).
