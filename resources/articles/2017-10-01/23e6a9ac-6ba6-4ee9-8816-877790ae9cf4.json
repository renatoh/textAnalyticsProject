Ishiguro, author of novels including The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go, was praised by the Swedish Academy for novels which \u201cuncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world\u201d and were driven by a \u201cgreat emotional force\u201d. Despite being among those tipped for the prize, whose previous winners include Seamus Heaney, Toni Morrison, Doris Lessing and Pablo Neruda, Ishiguro told the Guardian he had been completely unprepared for the announcement and had even doubted at first if it was true. \u201cYou\u2019d think someone would tell me first but none of us had heard anything,\u201d said Ishiguro, who had been sitting at his kitchen table at home in Golders Green in London about to have brunch, when he got the call from his agent. \u201cIt was completely not something I expected, otherwise I would have washed my hair this morning,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was absolute chaos. My agent phoned to say it sounded like they had just announced me as the Nobel winner, but there\u2019s so much fake news about these days it\u2019s hard to know who or what to believe so I didn\u2019t really believe it until journalists started calling and lining up outside my door.\u201d Ishiguro, who was born in Nagasaki in Japan but moved to the UK when he was five, said he was \u201ctremendously proud\u201d to receive the award and emphasised how much he hoped it would be a force for good at a time of global instability. \u201cThis is a very weird time in the world, we\u2019ve sort of lost faith in our political system, we\u2019ve lost faith in our leaders, we\u2019re not quite sure of our values, and I just hope that my winning the Nobel prize contributes something that engenders good will and peace,\u201d he said. \u201c It reminds us of how international the world is, and we all have to contribute things from our different corners of the world.\u201d With names including Margaret Atwood, Ngugi Wa Thiong\u2019o and Haruki Murakami leading the odds at the bookmakers, Ishiguro was a surprise choice and he admitted one of his first thoughts had jumped to fellow living authors he felt were equally deserving of a Nobel. \u201cPart of me feels like an imposter and part of me feels bad that I\u2019ve got this before other living writers,\u201d said Ishiguro. \u201cHaruki Murakami, Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Cormac McCarthy, all of them immediately came into my head and I just thought wow, this is a bit of a cheek for me to have been given this before them. \u201cAnd because I\u2019m completely delusional, part of me feels like I\u2019m too young to be winning something like this. But then I suddenly realised that I\u2019m 62, so I am average age for this I suppose.\u201d However, any concerns over Ishiguro\u2019s win creating friction in the literary world were quickly appeased as authors such as Rushdie were among the first to offer their congratulations. \u201cMany congratulations to my old friend Ish, whose work I\u2019ve loved and admired ever since I first read A Pale View of Hills,\u201d Rushdie said. \u201cAnd he plays the guitar and writes songs too! Roll over Bob Dylan.\u201d Ishiguro, who is currently \u201cvery deep\u201d into writing his latest novel, which he is juggling alongside film, theatre and graphic novel projects, also expressed concern at the distracting burden of celebrity that the Nobel prize might bring and impact on his writing. He said: \u201cI\u2019m hoping it doesn\u2019t mark some kind of end. I\u2019ve had to battle a lot of my writing life between the demands to be a public celebrity author and finding the time and space to do the real work, so I\u2019m hoping the work itself just continues and is no different to where it was yesterday. \u201cI just hope I don\u2019t get lazy or complacent, I hope my work won\u2019t change. And I hope that younger readers aren\u2019t put off by the Nobel. I have GCSE people reading my books and I\u2019m very proud to have that younger audience.\u201d Ishiguro studied creative writing at the University of East Anglia, going on to publish his first novel, A Pale View of the Hills, in 1982. He has been a full-time writer ever since. According to the Academy, the themes of \u201cmemory, time and self-delusion\u201d weave through his work, particularly in The Remains of the Day, which won Ishiguro the Booker prize in 1989 and was adapted into a film starring Anthony Hopkins as the \u201cduty-obsessed\u201d butler Stevens. Addressing Ishiguro\u2019s Nobel win, the former poet laureate Andrew Motion, said: \u201cIshiguro\u2019s imaginative world has the great virtue and value of being simultaneously highly individual and deeply familiar \u2013 a world of puzzlement, isolation, watchfulness, threat and wonder. \u201cHow does he do it?\u201d asked Motion. \u201cAmong other means, by resting his stories on founding principles which combine a very fastidious kind of reserve with equally vivid indications of emotional intensity. It\u2019s a remarkable and fascinating combination, and wonderful to see it recognised by the Nobel prize-givers.\u201d Will Self, meanwhile, reacted to Ishiguro\u2019s win in characteristically lugubrious fashion. Self said: \u201cHe\u2019s a good writer, and from what I\u2019ve witnessed a lovely man, but the singularity of his vision is ill-served by such crushing laurels, while I doubt the award will do little to reestablish the former centrality of the novel to our culture.\u201d The Nobel prize for literature comes with winnings of 9m Swedish krona (\u00a3832,000). Permanent secretary of the academy, Sara Danius, spoke to Ishiguro about his win around an hour after the announcement. It was a marked change to previous winners such as Bob Dylan, who took weeks to acknowledge the accolade, and Doris Lessing, who famously responded with a derisive \u201coh Christ\u201d when the news was broken to her by reporters. \u201cHe was very charming, nice and well-versed, of course. He said he felt very grateful and honoured, and that this is the greatest award you can receive,\u201d said Danius. \u201cHe is someone who is very interested in understanding the past, but he is not a Proustian writer, he is not out to redeem the past, he is exploring what you have to forget in order to survive in the first place as an individual or as a society,\u201d she said, adding, in the wake of last year\u2019s uproar over Dylan\u2019s award, that she hoped the choice would \u201cmake the world happy\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not for me to judge. We\u2019ve just chosen what we think is an absolutely brilliant novelist,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
