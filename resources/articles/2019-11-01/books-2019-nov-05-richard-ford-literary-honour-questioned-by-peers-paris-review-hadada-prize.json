Ford will be presented with the Hadada prize in April by Bruce Springsteen, who once described Ford\u2019s work as \u201cpoignant and hilarious\u201d. Ford follows in the footsteps of previous winners including Philip Roth, Norman Mailer and Joan Didion, with the magazine saying that his \u201cwriting has been commended for its \u2018linguistic mastery \u2026 rivalled by few, if any\u2019 and for the \u2018terse poetry\u2019 he brings to his prose\u201d. The prize is given to \u201ca distinguished member of the writing community who has made a strong and unique contribution to literature\u201d. But when the decision was announced on Monday, writers including Viet Thanh Nguyen, Sarah Weinman and Saeed Jones questioned the magazine\u2019s choice. While Ford has won critical acclaim for novels including The Sportswriter and The Lay of the Land, and won the Pulitzer for his 1995 novel Independence Day, his response to negative reviews has been criticised. In 2001, Whitehead wrote a negative review of his short story collection A Multitude of Sins, and at a party two years later Ford spat in his face. In 2017, he defended his response, writing that \u201cas of today, I don\u2019t feel any different about Mr Whitehead, or his review, or my response\u201d. Rebecca Solnit said of the exchange: \u201cThat\u2019s not a battle; that\u2019s just a white creep spitting on a black man like the white racists at the lunch counter sit-ins.\u201d Whitehead later warned other negative reviewers of the book \u201cthat they might want to get a rain poncho, in case of inclement Ford\u201d. When Alice Hoffman wrote what Ford called \u201cnasty things\u201d about Independence Day, he shot a hole through her latest book and posted it to her. In a 2003 interview with the Guardian, Ford said \u201cpeople make such a big deal out of it \u2013 shooting a book \u2013 it\u2019s not like I shot her\u201d. Nguyen, the Pulitzer-winning Vietnamese-American writer, pointed out that the magazine \u201chas never given this award to a writer of colour in 18 years, and only five women. They missed Toni Morrison. Living writers who could get this award: Maxine Hong Kingston, Sandra Cisneros, Edward P Jones, Louise Erdrich, Yusef Komunyakaa, to name a few,\u201d he wrote on Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
