The TUC said employers were being encouraged \"to make smash and grab raids on their staff's pension benefits\". This followed a speech by Christine Farnish, the chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, arguing that employers should be able to cut retrospectively benefits built up by employees in \"guaranteed\" occupational schemes. The TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, said: \"This is no more than a retrospective pay cut, cutting wages that have already been paid. Unions will fight this tooth and nail, both politically and in the courts. If this were allowed, there would be an inevitable chain reaction with every employer facing City pressure to break the pensions promise to their staff. \"It's odd to see the leader of what is meant to be a pro-pension body putting forward a proposal of collective self-harm.\" Union leaders were also quick to point out that boardrooms have, in most cases, maintained their final-salary benefits for directors while preparing to cut those of workers. In a speech to the annual conference of the NAPF, Ms Farnish said employers faced unprecedented costs and risks to their pension schemes. \"The scale and magnitude of these and the future uncertainties are far greater than anyone had ever imagined,\" she said. Employers are leaning on the government to include clauses in a new pensions bill allowing them to scale back their commitments to pay specific benefits. While ministers have said they will listen to arguments for such a move, it would be likely to meet strong opposition from the Labour backbenches as well as unions. Ms Farnish's comments followed research showing employers want employees to pay in more and work longer to fund final-salary pension benefits. Research by the pension advisers Aon Consulting reveals that more than seven out of 10 employers are considering telling staff they must increase the level of contributions. Almost a third of respondents said they would be considering making the demand within the next year. A fifth said they wanted to increase the retirement age. Reducing the benefit accrual rate for members was also likely to hit pension payouts. More than a quarter of respondents were contemplating this move in 2006, Aon said. In most cases the shift would reduce benefits from two-thirds of salary to a pension paying the equivalent of half salary. A spokesman for Aon said: \"Employers are trying to find a middle ground - a more measured approach to pension provision which sees both the employer and the employee share responsibility for the costs and risks ... more formalised risk-sharing may become more normal for such defined benefit schemes.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
