The result means that the House of Commons has rejected the Lords amendment to the health and social care (community health and standards) bill which stripped it of mentions of foundation hospitals. This afternoon's vote came after the health secretary, John Reid, told MPs that the measure would lock hospitals \"into public ownership\". He suggested that Tory opposition to the plans was motivated by the knowledge that \"a thriving local hospital owned by local people in a way that national services have never been owned before will defend itself politically against any future Conservative government's plans to privatise the National Health Service\". \"If people vote against the government they will be harming not only the National Health Service but harming our own government by marching into the lobbies with the crowd opposite,\" he warned Labour MPs. But many remained unconvinced. The Labour chairman of the health select committee, David Hinchliffe, called the proposals a \"half-baked idea\". \"I believe this policy represents a return to a market ethos and to competition,\" he said. Labour backbencher Joan Walley claimed that foundation hospitals would poach staff because they would be able to pay more than other hospitals. \"We will be increasing the health inequalities, not decreasing them,\" she warned. The Tory health spokesman, Tim Yeo, accused Mr Reid of being merely concerned with his future. \"Your concern about how the vote goes this afternoon is not a concern about what that vote will do to patients...it is a concern about what that vote will do to the government and your position in it,\" he told MPs. This afternoon's narrow victory for the government whips comes after the chancellor, Gordon Brown - who battled to water down the plans in cabinet committee - spent the morning ringing round wavering backbenchers seeking to persuade them to back the government. Mr Reid, who also met likely rebels, brought Mr Brown on board by agreeing a common line of argument in favour of foundation hospitals. Mr Ried claims in today's Guardian that \"choice and capacity are not rivals but partners\" in the NHS is the fruit of those discussions. He makes clear in his article that increased choice - a key aim of Blairite ministers - is only possible with increased capacity and investment. \"Without the increase in capacity, choice will remain theoretical at best and a cruel deception at worst,\" he said. Rumours are also circulating at Westminster that the former health minister, Alan Milburn, who aggressively pushed the policy of foundation hospitals but did not speak in this afternoon's debate, has been asked to keep a low profile today. Mr Milburn is known to have frequently clashed with Mr Brown. It was even reported in February that the department of health was pursuing a \"flying fuck\" strategy of ignoring Treasury reservations about its policy direction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
