World Cup qualification remains a long shot, even if the pulsating boost afforded to Scotland by Leigh Griffiths\u2019s outstanding double against England gave Strachan reason to believe. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t,\u201d the manager insisted. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t believe it I think it would rub off on the players. The players can sniff that.\u201d Strachan\u2019s own situation has, of course, been intrinsically linked to struggles which preceded the March win over Slovenia and briefly stirring events of Saturday. It now seems certain the 60-year-old will see out the campaign, which apart from anything else will be commercially and practically useful to the Scottish FA in terms of sourcing a replacement. \u201cI have got a way of dealing with it,\u201d Strachan said regarding speculation. \u201cWhat makes me strong is those players and everybody I have met this week. People come up to you and say: \u2018Keep it up, keep it going.\u2019 That energises you. \u201cYou all know that I do keep a barrier between myself and the media. It is nothing against you guys. I can get on and do my job, then it doesn\u2019t affect me. If it affected me then it would affect the players. You have seen the performances over the last couple of years. I have got no problem with that. Funnily enough, somebody said: \u2018Would you go back to full-time [club] management?\u2019 I said: \u2018Yeah, with that group I would.\u2019 \u201cI actually get excited when it\u2019s time to get together with them. I just love working with them. We have faults, we all know there are faults \u2013 but that\u2019s not their fault, that\u2019s the Scottish game.\u201d That widespread chasm between Scottish players and their English counterparts is not lost on any sane observer, albeit Strachan has regularly been guilty of underplaying what talent is actually at his disposal. Teams with less to pull upon have fared better than the Scots under Strachan\u2019s guidance. A case in point relates to Griffiths, whom Strachan showed a real reluctance to play until recently. The manager will claim it was a simple mistake but pointing towards Christophe Berra as a player at a Hearts team \u201cwho finished sixth\u201d in Scotland was disingenuous; they did not, just as the centre-back was virtually an ever\u2011present player last season for Ipswich Town in the Championship, a division from which Strachan has always drawn heavily. Berra was actually one of Scotland\u2019s best players on Saturday. \u201cListen, we have to improve,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a different story. We could sit here all night and talk about things that we have to do to make us better as a group. In general, we still have to improve a lot as a whole, Scottish players. \u201cWhat you can\u2019t say, though, is can you improve on your work rate. Unless you stand out there in that tunnel with these [English] guys and then get knocked down you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. It\u2019s like in rugby when you come up against a pack and that pack keeps knocking you back. It drains you. That\u2019s what happened with these guys. It drains you. But they kept finding an energy from somewhere.\u201d Scotland would now be helped in part by England maintaining their imperious qualifying form against other teams in the group. \u201cI hope so,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cThat\u2019s 35 games unbeaten [in tournament qualifiers] and it\u2019s the closest they\u2019ve been to losing that record. \u201cWe had a moment in the day that a lot of us in football won\u2019t forget. We will remember the noise after the second goal forever. It could have been the best ever. If you can leave memorable moments then you have given something to the game.\u201d Griffiths was so close to becoming a national hero. His international manager drew comparisons to David Beckham and his memorable free-kick goal for England against Greece in 2001. \u201cSome people can do it after 20 minutes when they\u2019re fresh,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cFor Leigh to dig out these two late on was incredible. I actually thought the second one would go in as well, I really did.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
