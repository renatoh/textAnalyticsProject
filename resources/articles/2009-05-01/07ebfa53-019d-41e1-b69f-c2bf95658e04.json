In a statement released by his agency, the American said his 37-year-old wife had been diagnosed with the disease after extensive tests. She is expected to undergo surgery within the next two weeks. Mickelson was due to play in this week's PGA Tour event in Texas, the Byron Nelson Championship, and next week's Crowne Plaza Invitational in Fort Worth, a tournament he won last year. The left-hander, currently ranked No2 in the world, was among the favourites for next month's US Open at Bethpage, New York, where he came second to Tiger Woods in 2002. Clearly his return there must now be in some doubt, as will his entry for the Open Championship at Turnberry. The Mickelsons met in 1992, when the golfer was a student at Arizona State University and she was a cheerleader with the Phoenix Suns basketball team. They married four years later and have three children, Amanda, aged nine, Sophie, aged seven, and Evan, who is six. At Wentworth, meanwhile, Justin Rose yesterday pulled out of this week's BMW Championship because of a back injury. Rose finished second in the event behind Anders Hansen after a play-off two years ago. He was replaced in the field by Scotland's Richie Ramsay, who will play with Thomas Bjorn and Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano when the tournament begins today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
