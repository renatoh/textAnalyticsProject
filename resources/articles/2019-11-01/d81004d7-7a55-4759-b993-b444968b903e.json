Croatia\u2019s 3-1 win over Slovakia means they top Group E, but the 2018 World Cup finalists got a scare when Robert Bozenik put the visitors ahead after 32 minutes in Rijeka. Two goals in four minutes from Nikola Vlasic and Bruno Petkovic settled the hosts\u2019 nerves near the hour mark, before Ivan Perisic sealed victory with a spectacular finish, volleying into the top corner on the stretch with 15 minutes to play. Things were more straightforward for Germany in M\u00f6nchengladbach, where the hosts beat Belarus 4-0. Matthias Ginter\u2019s backheeled finish from Serge Gnabry\u2019s cross gave Germany a half-time lead, and Leon Goretzka doubled their advantage shortly after the break, rifling a low shot home from a short corner. Midfielder Toni Kroos then stole the show with two fine goals as Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side sealed qualification from Group C. The Real Madrid midfielder sidefooted home clinically from the edge of the area on 55 minutes, and added a second late on after twisting beyond two defenders. Manuel Neuer denied Belarus a consolation from the penalty spot, tipping Ihar Stasevich\u2019s effort round the post. Austria secured a top-two finish in Group G with a 2-1 win over North Macedonia in Vienna. Stefan Lainer was the star man for the hosts, the Gladbach right-back setting up David Alaba with a terrific through ball after seven minutes, then bundling home a second from a corner early in the second half. Despite Vlatko Stojanovski\u2019s late consolation, Franco Foda\u2019s side held on to ensure their place at the finals. In Saturday\u2019s other games, already-qualified Poland beat Israel 2-1 in Jerusalem. Robert Lewandowski was on the substitutes\u2019 bench for the first hour, with Grzegorz Krychowiak and Milan striker Krzysztof Piatek getting the goals in his absence. Elsewhere in Group G, an own goal from Igors Tarasovs condemned Latvia to defeat in Slovenia \u2013 their ninth loss out of nine in this campaign. Belgium emphatically secured top spot in Group I, beating second-placed Russia 4-1 in St Petersburg. Eden Hazard scored twice after his brother, Thorgan, had put Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s side ahead. Romelu Lukaku added a fourth, lashing the ball home from the edge of the area, before Georgiy Dzhikija scored for the hosts. The group whipping boys, San Marino, remain without a point after losing 3-1 at home to Kazakhstan \u2013 but they scored their first goal of the campaign through Filippo Berardi, whose cool finish on the break sparked scenes of joy in Serravalle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
