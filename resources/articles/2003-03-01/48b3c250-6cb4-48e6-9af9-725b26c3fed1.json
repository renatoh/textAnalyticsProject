It also includes industrial designers and evangelists who will pitch the concept computers to manufacturers,\" says The Seattle Times. The idea is to create new platforms on which PC manufacturers can base their own designs. Examples include the Tablet PC and Media Center PC. Traditionally, this sort of thing used to be done by chip manufacturers as a way of encouraging companies to use their processors, eg the Tandy Color Computer and the WebPad. It helps companies that don't have a lot of cash for R&amp;D or a high level of skills to get into new markets. The scary part would be if Microsoft was really convinced a concept would appeal to the market and couldn't get anyone to take it up.... which is how it eventually arrived at doing the Xbox in-house."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
