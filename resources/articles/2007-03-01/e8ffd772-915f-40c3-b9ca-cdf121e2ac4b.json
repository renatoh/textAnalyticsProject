While such programmes don't exactly glamourise crime, neither do they paint a realistic picture of prison life. The Hull-based charity the No Way Trust aims to set the record straight. Each week, over 1,000 secondary school students take part in their crime and safety awareness days, designed to give young people an insight into prison life. Over the course of the day, students are taken off timetable and isolated from their peers. They participate in exercise and meal routines and are escorted between different areas of the school (renamed A wing, B wing and so on). Prison myths With the help of a mobile prison cell, the prison officers who run the events have little trouble dispelling popular myths that liken prisons to hotels. A few minutes inside the cell (complete with a prison- issue bed, adjacent toilet and bars across the window) is usually enough to quash any ideas about Playstations and pool tables. \"It's all about challenging perceptions,\" says Paul Wilkinson, chief executive of the No Way Trust. \"The media does distort reality. You watch something like Bad Girls and they've all got their cells doors open. In a real prison, people would just help themselves to each other's stuff.\" The trust was founded by Wilkinson and fellow Hull prison officers David Jones and Sam Hall in 1993. After 14 years working with adult and top-security prisoners, Wilkinson had gone to work in a young offenders' institute and was \"immediately struck by how hurt and upset the youngsters were\". He says: \"We want to make sure they don't end up in prison in the first place.\" The charity believes educating young people about the realities of prison life can encourage them to think twice about getting into trouble. As well as the practical workshops, it also produces a range of teaching resources. Wilkinson is still a serving prison officer, working four days a week in Hull prison in addition to his work for the trust, which is mostly staffed by volunteers. As well as the workshops, the trust also helps schools to access grants or funding to cover the cost of the awareness days. Where funding is not available, the charity will try to subsidise or meet the costs in full. The use of shock tactics makes for maximum impact. A couple of hours of being marched around the school, being kept inside at break time and having to ask permission to go to the toilet soon takes its toll. \"We've had children get very upset and annoyed at having their freedom restricted,\" says Janine Killough, citizenship and personal, social and health education coordinator at Valentine's high school in Ilford, Essex, which recently hosted an awareness day for year 8 students, for the third year running. \"I thought prison would be bad, but not that bad,\" admits Stuart, a year 8 student. \"The prison cell was barely six feet wide. The prison officer told us that any narrower and you would go mad, which is why it's that size. It was cramped, smelly and not private. The prisoners are treated a bit like animals. It would definitely make me think twice about committing a crime.\" Classmate Anisa was also struck by the lack of privacy. \"The toilet wasn't sectioned off in any way and some prisoners have to share cells. That sounds horrible.\" The use of artefacts makes it all the more hard-hitting, says Killough. \"The officers bring in all sorts of bits of prison uniform to show them, even boxer shorts. I think they deliberately pick out things that look a bit grubby and soiled, which has all the children gagging.\" The key message of the day is \"choice\", she says. \"It really makes the students think about the consequences of making the wrong choices. Because they are hearing it from professionals, the message has far greater impact.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
