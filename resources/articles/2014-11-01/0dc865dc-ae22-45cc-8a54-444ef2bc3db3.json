It was not among the adjectives he reached for early on in his reign when he ejected the scrum-half from the squad after a second drunken exploit in three weeks but the player and the national team are in a different place now. When he disciplined Care, a player he had coached as a youngster in Leeds, in January 2012, Lancaster said he would not give up on the Harlequin, saying: \u201cI think he can become the world\u2019s No1 scrum-half\u201d. Care has become England\u2019s first-choice No9, a position the coach describes as the most competitive in the squad with Ben Youngs, Lee Dickson and Richard Wigglesworth all vying for favour, and it will be a considerable surprise if he does not start for Lancaster against New Zealand on Saturday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change now what happened to me,\u201d says Care, who last month became a father for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s part of growing up, part of life. Everyone has their own story and we all go through good and bad times. I\u2019ve learnt from that experience [in 2012] and I think it made me the player and person I am today. I went back and worked on my game and took it a lot more seriously. I wanted to be playing for my country as England\u2019s No9. It\u2019s the ultimate honour. And I wanted to go to the World Cup and try to win it. That\u2019s the dream. I\u2019ll do anything I can to keep playing well and keep making people proud. \u201cIt was a bit of an eye opener not getting picked and knowing that it was for your own wrong-doing was a horrible feeling. I\u2019ll never let it happen again. You wonder how you are going to get back in but Stuart made it very clear that, if I let my rugby do the talking, the door would not be shut on me. He was frustrated, telling me he knew the potential I had and that I was not fulfilling it.\u201d Care believes that fatherhood has also changed him. \u201cIt puts a lot of things into perspective and makes you suddenly grow up. For the first in my life I\u2019ve properly got responsibility. I\u2019ve got someone else to look after rather than myself. It\u2019s an unbelievable feeling. It makes you grow up and not worry about the little things quite so much.\u201d Care made his name as an impulsive scrum-half who never missed an opportunity to lift the tempo of a game by taking a penalty quickly or looking for gaps in the opposition defence but Lancaster feels he now has a rounded view of the game, more calculating and patient, a controlling influence who has forged a strong partnership with Owen Farrell at half-back. \u201cDanny has always had a point of difference but in the last year he has matured and come to understand his leadership role in the team,\u201d says Lancaster, \u201cand what it takes to win in different ways. Previously everything was about playing quick all the time, tapping and going, but sometimes in certain games you have to kick well as a nine and show the control of a game manager. He now recognises when a wing is up on a ruck in the centre of the field and puts the ball in behind and rolls it into touch, giving the opposition the pressure of a line-out in their own 22. When someone makes a mistake, you give them another chance. Danny has taken his extremely well.\u201d Care has become adept at dropping goals, a way of turning pressure into points. \u201cOne thing the coaches wanted me to work on was not letting the outside-half do all the decision-making,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took me a while to realise I could influence games by being smarter. \u201cA few years ago I thought a match could be played at 100mph, throwingthe ball around and going from everywhere, but at Test match level the difference is often only a few points and a mistake can be the difference between winning and losing. I want to be unpredictable. We\u2019re coming up against the best teams in the world in the next few weeks and we need to consistently make the right decisions.\u201d England have 12 Test matches before they start tilting for the World Cup they are hosting. They face New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia at Twickenham this month where they will play three of their Six Nations matches and two of their warm-up matches before the tournament. The next time they meet the All Blacks after the weekend could be in the World Cup final with the two countries avoiding each other in the knock-out stages if they win their groups. That will be more of a task for Lancaster\u2019s men, who have to contend with Australia and Wales. \u201cWe need to be beating the big teams, especially at home,\u201d says Care. \u201cThe first two games are against the first and second best in the world. In at the deep end but they are the matches you want to play in. We beat the All Blacks two years ago and South Africa defeated them recently so they are not invincible. They are an unbelievable team, the best in the world, but we think there are a few areas that we can challenge them in and we back ourselves to be pushing them come the World Cup. \u201cStuart is a coach you want to play for. I have known him since I was 14 and I am as scared of him now as I was then. He has brought a culture to the squad and we want to take that forward and establish a legacy. He is a proud bloke and we want to do well for him. He believes in values, what being an England rugby player means, the people we are representing, those who have worn the jersey before. We want to play for the whole country and inspire people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
