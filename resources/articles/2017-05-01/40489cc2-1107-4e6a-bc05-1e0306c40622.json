Jo\u00ebl Veltman 6 Fractious tussle with Mkhitaryan in the first half but made little genuine impact going forward and was rarely engaged defensively. Matthijs de Ligt 7 The 17-year-old showed strength and doggedness beyond his years at centre-back and clearly has an exciting future. Davinson S\u00e1nchez 8 Unlucky with the nick on Pogba\u2019s goal, which cannot detract from an hugely impressive display. Fine late challenge on Lingard. Ja\u00efro Riedewald 5 Sloppy throw-in gifted United possession for their first goal and although the left-back was steady thereafter it proved costly. Lasse Sch\u00f6ne 5 Experienced midfielder struggled to gain his side a foothold in an area United dominated physically from the opening moments. Hakim Ziyech 6 Such a creative force at his best but, aside from one fine ball for Younes after the break, was kept away from dangerous areas. Davy Klaassen 6 Captain tried to threaten with runs beyond the defence but had little joy and made scant impact in possession. Bertrand Traor\u00e9 6 Forced Romero into a save after 15 minutes and was Ajax\u2019s biggest first-half threat with some strong runs but influence faded. Amin Younes 6 Showed his ability to take men on with two promising runs in the opening period but buzzed around to little further effect. Kasper Dolberg 5 Barely had a kick although the supply lines were blocked and there was little support. Replaced just after the hour. Substitutes Neres 6 (for Dolberg, 62); Van de Beek 6 (for Sch\u00f6ne, 70); De Jong 6 (for Riedewald, 82) Not used Boer, Tete, Westermann, Kluivert MANCHESTER UNITED Sergio Romero 6 Held a first-half shot from Traor\u00e9 but was hardly extended otherwise, making David de Gea\u2019s absence a non-issue. Antonio Valencia 7 Tested Onana with his first run forwards and was rarely exposed by Younes\u2019s dribbling skills at the other end. Chris Smalling 8 Justified his selection by dominating Dolberg and was equally commanding when nodding down for Mkhitaryan\u2019s strike. Daley Blind 7 Kept his old team at bay with relative ease, mopping up whatever went astray around the box and tracking runners carefully. Matteo Darmian 7 Stopped a dangerous Traor\u00e9 run before half-time and stood up comfortably on a night when the defence was hardly ever stretched. Ander Herrera 7 Kept a close eye on the dangerous Ziyech and his intelligence was integral to a midfield that seized control from the beginning. Paul Pogba 8 Had a slice of luck for his goal but started the game well and did not let up. Passed astutely and helped United overpower Ajax. Marouane Fellaini 8 Did exactly the job required, squeezing the midfield space and teeing up Pogba for the opener. Could have scored with a header. Juan Mata 7 Put in a decent shift but found few opportunities to be constructive, tucking in diligently when Ajax had possession. Henrikh Mkhitaryan 7 Had endured a tetchy first half, being booked for a foul on Veltman, but that was forgotten when he popped up to finish so sharply. Marcus Rashford 7 Was the outlet for a number of early balls as United looked to stretch Ajax. Ran willingly but rarely into goalscoring areas. Substitutes Lingard 7 (for Mkhitaryan, 74); Martial 6 (for Rashford, 84); Rooney 6 (for Mata, 90) Not used De Gea, Jones, Carrick, Fosu-Mensah Referee Damir Skomina Slovenia"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
