Speaking from the headquarters of news website Rappler on Wednesday before she was taken away by four plainclothes officers, Maria Ressa said she was not intimidated. \u201cThese legal acrobatics show how far the government will go to silence journalists, including the pettiness of forcing me to spend the night in jail,\u201d she added. The charge of cyber-libel, which Ressa denies, was filed by the justice department and the warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest issued by a Manila court judge on Tuesday. After she was arrested, Ressa was taken to the National Bureau of Investigations, which is under the Department of Justice, where she was to be held overnight. \u201cThe filing of this case is preposterous and baseless,\u201d said Rappler in a statement. \u201cIf this is another of several attempts to intimidate us, it will not succeed, as past attempts have shown.\u201d The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines described the arrest as a \u201cshameless act of persecution by a bully government\u201d. \u201cIt is clear this is part of the administration\u2019s obsession to shut Rappler down and intimidate the rest of the independent Philippine media into toeing the line,\u201d the NUJ said in a statement. The charges against Ressa relate to a story published on Rappler\u2019s website in May 2012 that alleged ties between a Philippine businessman, Wilfredo D Keng, and a high court judge. The controversial cyber-libel law under which she is being prosecuted, was enacted four months after the story was written. The libel case was first brought in 2017, but initially dismissed by the NBI. It was reopened in 2018. Ressa\u2019s arrest comes just two months after she turned herself in to authorities over charges of tax evasion at Rappler. Speaking on her release on bail in December, Ressa accused the Philippine government of trying to intimidate and harass journalists and \u201cweaponising the rule of law\u201d against its critics. Rappler, which is one of the most influential news sites in the Philippines, has also been one of the news outlets most critical of Duterte\u2019s administration since he took power in 2016. In particular, it has scrutinised his government over the brutal war on drugs, which officially has taken more than 5,000 lives, though human rights groups allege the true figure is more than double that. In response, Duterte\u2019s administration has instigated seven separate cases against Rappler. The government banned Rappler\u2019s political reporter from the presidential palace. It has ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate Rappler for being \u201cforeign-owned\u201d, even going as far as revoking its licence, in a case that went all the way to the court of appeal. In November, the Department of Justice confirmed it was charging Rappler with three counts of failure to file returns, and one count of tax evasion \u2013 all charges that Ressa denies. The charges carry heavy fines and jail sentences of up to 10 years. Ressa\u2019s refusal to back down has won her plaudits around the world. She was named a Time magazine person of the year in 2018, and won the 2018 Knight International Journalism award and this year\u2019s prestigious Press Freedom award, given by the Committee to Protect Journalists. Butch Olano, the director of Amnesty International Philippines, described Ressa\u2019s arrest as \u201cbrazenly politically motivated, and consistent with the authorities\u2019 threats and repeated targeting of Ressa and her team\u201d. \u201cIn a country where justice takes years to obtain, we see the charges against her being railroaded and the law being used to relentlessly intimidate and harass journalists for doing their jobs as truth-tellers,\u201d Olano said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
