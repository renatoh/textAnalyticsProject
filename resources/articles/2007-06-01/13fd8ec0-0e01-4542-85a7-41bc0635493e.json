For him he's simply doing what's in his capabilities.\" These are tough days for player and coach, or so it would appear from the outside with Murray slowly recovering from a right wrist injury that makes him a doubt for Wimbledon. However, Gilbert, the Lawn Tennis Association's performance coach, remains the epitome of calm. \"Anytime anybody is injured you always feel for them. But it's part of being an athlete, part of the job. Everybody gets hurt. It's important to stay motivated and keep a positive attitude. The medical advice is more important than anything. You can't be pushing somebody if something is wrong. The experts will say when it's time to do this or that. If not, you can't.\" When Murray roared in pain after hitting a forehand against Italy's Filippo Volandri in the first round of the Hamburg Open, two weeks before the start of the French Open, it seemed obvious it was a severe injury. \"It looked serious but sometimes you never know,\" said Gilbert. \"In the last 10 to 15 years there have been more players having wrist problems because of the rackets and the strings and how much harder they are hitting the ball. Quite a few players have hurt their opposite hand, like Marat Safin and Kim Clijsters. But once something happens, you deal with it. Andy's 20 and it's all about getting better. You see where [Novak] Djokovic is and [Rafael] Nadal. No matter who I am coaching it's all about getting better. The most important thing I learned from Andre [Agassi] is just keep working on your game.\" Already thoughts are focused on the US hardcourt season leading up to the US Open, with Murray due to play in Los Angeles, Indianapolis, Washington, Montreal and Cincinnati. \"Hardcourts are obviously his favourite surface and he feels it's a great opportunity. But first and foremost it's about health. Some injuries are a little different - you play with some easier than others. With this one, a lot of players have missed a long period of time. If you are swinging the racket and you are not right, then you're not right. It's not like you tweaked a little hamstring or something. But if Andy is 100% healthy he'll be looking to play all those tournaments.\" The best match Gilbert believes Murray has played to date was during last year's US Open, the tournament he has always said he wants to win most. \"Andy played unbelievably in the fourth and fifth set against Chile's Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez. He was down two sets to one, with the other guy playing really well, and then he wins the last two sets three and two [6-3, 6-2]. Then at this year's Australian Open he pushed Nadal to the limit.\" The biggest disappointment was losing to Russia's Nikolay Davydenko in the fourth round of the US Open, after he had beaten Gonz\u00e1lez. The match was rain-interrupted and when it restarted the next day Murray appeared flat. \"Davydenko played rough. Andy had some chances, but the guy lifted his game. It was one of those days,\" said Gilbert. \"Davydenko had that little bit more experience and Andy has beaten him twice since then. Sometimes that happens. You can't over- analyse things.\" Gilbert feels for Henman as Wimbledon approaches: \"He's a great guy and has had a phenomenal career. It's strange for me over here. Some Brit will get to the third round and suddenly it's an amazing result and will be all over the papers. Tim gets close - four semi-finals - and all of a sudden it's like you're down on him because he hasn't crossed the finishing line. I kinda struggle with that. He's gotten close but close is not good enough. I want to think he crossed paths with some ridiculously great players. It coincided with Pete Sampras, Goran [Ivanisevic] was in the final four times, and then he jumps into Roger Federer. Tim happened to be around with two of the best, excluding [Bjorn] Borg, grass-court players of all time. There were some rough customers.\" With Murray sidelined Gilbert has been keeping a special eye on the progress of Alex Bogdanovic, Britain's No3, who is pressing to get into the top 100, but lost disappointingly yesterday in Nottingham. \"Alex is a great kid with a lot of talent. After struggling to beat Jamie Baker at Queen's you'd think there was no way that he could possibly play so well against Andy [Roddick]. But that shows you the wide range the guys can have. \"Alex is a tremendous ball striker and a great tennis player when he is 'on'. He should be ranked higher but a lot of guys are like that. It's a matter of putting it together consistently. When I was playing it was 30, 40,or 50 deep. Honest to God, it's like 300-500 deep now. It reminds you that whenever you play, you have always got to be ready. And for Alex it's about being consistent and being able to put it together for longer periods of time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
