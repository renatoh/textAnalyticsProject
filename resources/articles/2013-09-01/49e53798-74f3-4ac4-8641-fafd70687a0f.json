As I have said throughout this campaign, this ballot is the start of Labor\u2019s rebuilding and winning the next election. But make no mistake: this is a tough time for our movement. The Australian people spoke definitively on September 7. We cannot ignore that only 34 in every 100 Australians gave us their first vote. That\u2019s sobering news. But let\u2019s not forget \u2013 over 3.7m Australians still voted for us \u2013 more than any other individual party \u2013 and placed their faith in us. There are reasons to be optimistic. Our membership continues to increase, our online supporter base has grown exponentially and tens of thousands volunteered during the election, more than ever before. Today, our movement is faced with a great task. We must change. Of course, we have been through tough times before and changed our ways. When Gough Whitlam became leader of our party in 1967 we had been out of office for 18 years and had been thrashed at the previous year\u2019s election. He adopted a simple saying \u2013 \u201cparty, policy, people.\u201d And 46 years on, our party should act with these three Ps in mind. Labor is at its best when we are the party of ideas and action \u2013 ideas that empower the powerless and actions that build a better Australia for the long term. Our track-record in government over the past six years shows that we turn great, nation building ideas into action including by putting a price on carbon pollution, or building the NBN. As a member of the previous Labor government, I am extremely proud to have had the opportunity to help build the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We should be proud of our record in government, especially our economic record which protected millions of jobs from the worst of the global financial crisis. I want to build a Big Labor party. A party of big ideas. A party which is deeply connected to the community. A party which reflects our diverse nation. I want to renew our party from the bottom up and I want the energy and passion we saw in the election on display for the next three years. To build that party, we must bring the party together and bring more people from diverse backgrounds into our movement. Our membership needs to be drawn from the cities and regions of our nation and from across a wide array of occupations, including small business people, tradies, farmers, professional women and academics. It should be easier for members to have a formal say. For example, all party members should be granted full voting rights upon joining. But I also believe the best way to democratise the party and promote transparency is through sheer weight of numbers, by opening up the party to many new members. This is how we can do this: we should continue \"primary\" style community pre-selections that have been trialled in a number of seats in order to give our members a bigger say and help ensure that our party produces even better candidates. We should consider quotas for sections of our community that are underrepresented in our parliaments, including Indigenous Australians. And of course we must redouble our efforts to ensure at least 40% of our candidates are female. Labor must work harder to attract and retain members. The party should be cheaper to join with discounted rates available for union members as well as for students, pensioners and people out of work. New members should be quickly and formally introduced to the party. All ALP members will have the opportunity to be educated in our party\u2019s history and structures, ongoing mentoring and immersed in the social activities of our party. New members should be be encouraged to contribute to the party\u2019s policy-making forums. If I am elected leader, my shadow opposition team will actively incorporate the policy contributions of all our members by instituting policy action committees as recommend by the 2010 National Review. I also want to see an online supporter category of membership established. This would be \"try before you buy\" low-cost option that will allow all community members to experience the ALP with a view to taking up a paid membership. Members should be able to join policy branches, enabling them to participate in all forums of the party. We must make it easier for members to participate in branch meetings. Branches should be connected to their communities and actively engaged in locally-based, progressive and community building campaigns. For a start, we must capture the best of the successful field campaigns from both the federal election and the leadership ballot. I believe these reforms are the foundation upon which we must build our new Labor party. Not only is this ballot a genuine opportunity to engage and reconnect with members but it is a reform that has the potential to attract thousands of new members. But we need our party rules to catch up with this process and this new politics because at the moment our actions are ahead of our systems. By renewing our great movement and outlining Labor\u2019s vision for Australia\u2019s future, together we can win the next election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
