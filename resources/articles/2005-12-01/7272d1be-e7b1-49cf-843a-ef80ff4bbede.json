Children are introduced to the pleasure of poetry and rhyme in the home and at primary school, but when they move on to secondary school, most never bother with a poem again.\" You can blame the government for sidelining poetry on the national curriculum. You can blame teachers for making it seem so dull. You can even blame poets themselves for their parochialism and wilful inaccessibility. But you can't get away from the fact that verse appears to be an integral part of the human condition. A generation of kids that found no meaning in Keats, Milton and Larkin can quote endlessly from Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and John Lennon. And somewhere in a bedroom near you, there will be an adolescent poring over the lyrics of The Streets, Pete Doherty or the Arctic Monkeys. For most previous incumbents, the title poet laureate seemed to mean nothing more than churning out the odd bit of doggerel on royal marriages, deaths and, increasingly, divorces in return for \u00a35,000 a year. But when Motion decided to accept the job back in 1999, he wanted to find a way of reconnecting the rhythms of the streets with the rhythms of verse. His opportunity came when his publisher asked him to record his work. \"I was talking to the producer about how sad it was we had lost the chance to hear so many of the great modern poets reading their work,\" he says. \"Famously we have Tennyson, Browning and Whitman, but we have missed out on Hardy, Lawrence and Housman. So together we conceived the idea of creating a sound archive of modern English-speaking poets. You can't underestimate the importance of sound: it was only when I heard a recording of Eliot reading The Waste Land that it began to make sense to me at school. Before that, it had seemed impenetrable.\" Five years and several grants later, the idea reached fruition with the opening of the National Poetry Archive last month. Motion's intention is that the recordings should be as catholic as possible to reflect all cultural voices. \"But cash is limited,\" he admits, \"so there is a committee to decide what should be added. At the moment, we're restricting ourselves to published poets.\" A long-term goal is to use actors to record the work of dead poets. \"It raises interesting questions of interpretation,\" says Motion. \"Some scholars argue Keats was a cockney, so maybe the recording should reflect that. Similarly, if you listen to Wordsworth spoken in a Cumberland accent, you can pick up rhymes that are not immediately apparent in received pronunciation.\" Prep school fear Motion grew up on the Essex-Suffolk border, where his father worked as a brewer. \"My family didn't place great value on learning and there were few books in the house,\" he says. \"My brother and I were sent away to a dreadful prep school in Northamptonshire. Philip Larkin once said that life is first boredom, then fear. But I rather feel that he got it the wrong way round. For my entire time at that school, I was frightened of being punished and learned very little.\" There was no immediate improvement when he moved on to Radley, where he bumped uneasily along the bottom in a state of self-imposed near-anonymity, collecting just six O-levels. \"My highest grade was the one above a pass.\" Things picked up in the sixth form. \"I had a brilliant English teacher called Peter Way,\" he says, \"and it was as if the lights had suddenly been switched on. Literature that had previously meant nothing now made sense; reading became a natural part of life, not some enforced bolt-on. I had a gloriously unencumbered time - without the pressure of exams - in the first year of A-levels, reading my way through Larkin, Milton and Edward Thomas.\" It coincided with the accident to his mother that became the defining moment of his life. Out riding one day, she fell from her horse and remained in a coma for three years. She eventually regained consciousness but was never well enough to leave hospital and died six years later. \"Poetry served both as a retreat from life,\" Motion says, \"and as a framework to understand its miserable randomness. It made me realise that though we may strive to do good, there is no connection between virtue and reward.\" As well as reading poetry, Motion tried his hand at writing it. \"My early efforts were unstructured verbal eruptions,\" he laughs, \"though Mr Way did find some merit in them. What he did, though, was make useful suggestions - such as show, not tell - and give me the confidence to persevere.\" Up at Oxford, Motion soon found himself with an even better guide. \"WH Auden was going through a difficult time in his life and Christchurch provided him with a cottage in the grounds where he could live and work. We were introduced and, for some reason, he decided to take me under his wing and offered me a weekly session on poetry writing. It was just an unbelievable experience. I worshipped him the other side of idolatory and it was like spending an hour each week in the presence of God. He taught me a great deal about structure and technique; he believed that poems had to make sense on their own terms, that you couldn't make eccentric connections in poetry that wouldn't happen in real life.\" There weren't many academic jobs for poets in the early 80s, when Margaret Thatcher's knife was cutting back arts and humanities departments, and Motion was delighted to be offered a post teaching English at Hull. \"I suppose, in some pious way,\" he smiles, \"I thought it was important to have some experience of a place that wasn't south of Watford. But I was happy enough to just have a job.\" The appointment also placed him close to Larkin - another of his all-time heroes - who worked in the university library. \"I did think it would be nice to meet him,\" he says, \"but I never presumed for a moment that we would become friends. He had a reputation for being austere and reserved, but really he was just painfully shy. Everyone always assumes shyness is something that only afflicts the young, but the condition persists and Larkin was never given the understanding he deserved for it.\" As with Auden, Larkin saw something he liked in the neophyte poet. \"I think he enjoyed the fact that my Dad was a brewer and made something people actually wanted. Unlike poets, who produce things no one seems to want.\" The friendship lasted. Motion became one of Larkin's literary executors and went on to write his biography, a book that was well received by almost everyone other than Kingsley and Martin Amis. \"I think they didn't like the fact that Larkin's private side had been exposed to the public gaze,\" he says. \"But I felt it was important to show the real man, as it provides a window into his poetry. \"Many people used to assume his grumpiness was a persona he adopted, when it was actually part of who he was. His poems are essentially quarrels with himself - between the foul-mouthed demotic and the romantic - about being Philip Larkin. As a result, we now read his poems as much more complicated, darker works than we did before.\" After 15 years in the north-east, Motion moved south to the University of East Anglia to take over the postgraduate course in creative writing that had been started by Malcolm Bradbury and Angus Wilson 25 years previously. It sounds like a plum gig - the course was one of the best-known in the country - but Motion was aware he was flirting with danger. \"Malcolm and Angus must have thought it was the easiest job in the world after having Ian McEwan as a first student and Kazuo Ishiguro shortly afterwards,\" he says. \"So I was acutely aware there was a great deal to live up to.\" High hit rate Motion dealt with the problem by expanding the course's remit. Where Bradbury and Wilson had restricted themselves to a small prose group, Motion opened the doors to biography, screen- and script-writing and poetry while managing to retain a high hit rate of students getting book deals and appearing on literary prize lists. But you sense that the strain of running a high-profile course got to him in the end and that he had little trouble accepting an offer from Royal Holloway in 2003 to run its creative writing course. He says that he relished the opportunity to work with a more culturally diverse group of students, but the anonymity and lower expectations were clearly a big draw as well. Buzz of teaching Much as Motion enjoys the buzz of teaching, it's as a poet he is best known and most wants to be remembered. He's acutely aware how easy it is to be distracted. \"Larkin used to look on the library as his proper job,\" he says. \"Poetry was something he did in the evenings from 6 o'clock until he was too drunk to continue. I try to incorporate my poetry writing more into my everyday working routine.\" Motion feels his best poems are those that deal with his childhood and his mother - \"they are mainly about taking pleasure in things for their own sake and resolving the philosophical problems of the randomness of violence\" - but he accepts that most people will remember him more for his work in the role of poet laureate. \"I acknowledge that some people have problems with the notion of writing poems to mark events in the royal calendar,\" he says. \"But I don't really. I am at the reforming end of the monarchist spectrum, but a monarchist nonetheless, so I have no desire to write poems that are disrespectful about the royal family. As a result, I have never felt as if I were being censored in any way. The government may have preferred it if I hadn't written poems about the Iraq war, but no one has ever censured me about it.\" Even so, Motion has hedged his bets. Where previous poet laureates took the job for life, he has always said he will do it for just 10 years. \"I want to keep some control of my life,\" he says. \"I've got books to write, the poetry archive to run, a course to teach, and I don't want to feel permanently as if I'm fighting my schedule. Writers need staring-into-space time every bit as much as they need desk time.\" And when he does get some staring-into-space time, does he ever find himself tempted to switch on the TV? He glances over to the large set that dominates one corner of his sitting-room. \"Daytime television?\" he exclaims, lying through his teeth. \"The very idea.\" Curriculum vitae Name: Andrew Motion Age: 53 Job: Professor of creative writing, Royal Holloway, University of London; poet laureate Previously: Lecturer in English, Hull University; professor of creative writing, University of East Anglia Likes: Fly-fishing Dislikes: Being late Poetry: Poems 1974-84; Natural causes; The Price of Everything Prose: Philip Larkin: A Writer's Life; Wainewright the Poisoner; The Invention of Dr Cake Separated: with three children"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
