Conte posted a video on his Facebook page of the prime minister being offered a cue and joking that she would be \u201chopeless\u201d. May appeared surprised at the proposal and told Conte \u201cYou\u2019ll have to show me how\u201d, which results in the Italian prime minister giving a demonstration. In the footage, chief of staff Gavin Barwell shows the Conservative leader how to position her hand on the table while striking the cue ball, although the footage ends before she takes a shot. Retweeting the video, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, joked: \u201cPleased to see nothing\u2019s been taken off the table.\u201d May is hoping she will not end up behind the eight ball during the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh. The prime minister, who announced that MPs may have to wait until 12 March for a meaningful vote on the government\u2019s final Brexit deal, is also expected to meet Angela Merkel on Monday. The pool video is not the first time that May has been caught on film at a pastime in which she is less than expert. Her dancing caused laughter when she visited South Africa and Kenya in August but she was able to poke fun at herself later. She entered the stage for her keynote speech at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham while swaying along to Abba\u2019s Dancing Queen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
