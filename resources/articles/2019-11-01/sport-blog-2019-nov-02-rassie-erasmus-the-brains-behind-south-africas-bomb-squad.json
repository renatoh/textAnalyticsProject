It was a tactical triumph for the Springboks coach, Rassie Erasmus, who, two years ago, was on his way from Munster to run the disintegrating professional game in South Africa only to find when he arrived home that the national side demanded his immediate attention. But the Springboks\u2019 triumph was also based on his belief that sport is equally about the physical and the mental. South Africa owed their World Cup success not only to the aggression that burned in all their players, even those rather smaller than the forwards who seem as wide as they are tall, such as Faf de Klerk and Cheslin Kolbe, but their ability to sustain the onslaught for 80 minutes. The approach saw off Japan, Wales \u2013 a side that prides itself on its physicality \u2013 and now England. At no point in those matches were the Springboks behind. Erasmus has, in four games, including the three in the knockout stage, split his bench (known as the Bomb Squad) between six forwards and two backs, rather than the conventional five and three. It gave him an alternative tight five, and with Bongi Mbonambi and Lood de Jager barely lasting beyond the opening quarter against England, his decision was seen to be vindicated. As a young coach Erasmus noted: \u201cIt has been scientifically proven that at the end of a game more oxygen is being used to keep tired bodies moving than their brains thinking clearly. I believe that it is at this critical stage that a game is won and lost.\u201d And so South Africa were able to finish as they started, on the front foot and in control. The front-row forwards involved in the final who had the most minutes on the field in the tournament played for England, Jamie George and Kyle Sinckler, even though the latter lasted three minutes on Saturday before suffering concussion, and they played one match fewer with Typhoon Hagibis forcing the cancellation of the encounter against France. \u201cOur front row guys did not have heavy loads,\u201d said Erasmus. \u201cThey tended to play the same number of minutes in the tournament and that helped today in the scrum.\u201d The spread of minutes for South Africa\u2019s six front-rowers was between the 230 played by the prop Vincent Koch and the 270 required of Tendai Mtawarira. England, in contrast, ranged from Luke Cowan-Dickie\u2019s 150 minutes to George\u2019s 317. South Africa\u2019s two tries came in the final 15 minutes, a time when England were chasing the game but had not reached the point where hope melted into despair. The Springboks were using oxygen to keep thinking clearly. Erasmus was at his first World Cup while his opposite number, Eddie Jones, was in his fourth and had suffered two defeats in the tournament, the 2003 final to England and a group match in 2015 against Scotland when he coached Japan. England were the firm favourites after their emphatic victory over New Zealand in the semi-final, but what seemed to be forgotten in the buildup to the final was that only a week before the All Blacks had been basking in the demolition of a team who had beaten them twice in three years, Ireland. England were on the back foot from the start. A feature of South Africa under Erasmus, starting in their victory over the All Blacks in Wellington last year, their first in New Zealand for nine years, is based on protecting the gainline and scavenging tries. The statistics in the final were typical of their matches since then: England had the ball but the Springboks had the points. Wales in the semi-final had 114 carries to South Africa\u2019s 71 but made 182 metres to their opponents\u2019 296. England had 122 carries and covered 173 metres while the Springboks made 380 metres from 89 carries. In both games, their opponents made less than 1.5 metres per carry, nowhere near enough to threaten the gainline, while the Boks made more than four. Erasmus has the demeanour of a jovial landlord, so open with the media there is no hint of pretence, yet all his players refer to his single-mindedness and belief in the power of sport to change the lives of supporters, however briefly. South Africa, the second most successful nation in the history of the game after New Zealand, had become a study in failure before he arrived, divided and fragmented. Erasmus played in the 1999 World Cup semi-final against Australia, a tryless epic that went to extra time, and he quickly had South Africa playing like the Springboks again, hard and mean. After the bruising and, to some, boring semi-final victory over Wales, he promised England more of the same but came up with one new play that punctured a threatened revival in the second half: seven forwards standing close together on the left of the breakdown who immediately bound together so that when the ball-carrier was tackled, it was a penalty for collapsing a maul.
