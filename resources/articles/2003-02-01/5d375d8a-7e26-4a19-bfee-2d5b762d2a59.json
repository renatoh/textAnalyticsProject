It has long advised against travelling to Iraq, but is now warning of the danger of British citizens being used as human shields by the Iraqi regime in the event of war. \"If you are considering going to Iraq, you should be aware that British nationals were used as hostages during the 1990-91 crisis, being held where their safety was at most risk,\" the revised advice says. \"You should also be aware that there is no British diplomatic presence in Iraq to offer consular assistance.\" Foreign Office officials have also warned against non-essential travel to Kuwait, again citing regional tensions and the possibility of terrorist action as the reasons. \"If already in Kuwait, we advise you to leave unless you consider that your presence there is essential. We have ordered the departure of dependants of staff at the embassy in Kuwait, and authorised the departure of those of our staff who wish to leave,\" the office says. Non-essential travel to Israel is also warned against, with Britons being urged to leave the West Bank and Gaza. The advice also applies to East Jerusalem. \"You should consider your arrangements for leaving, and in particular check that your travel documents are in order,\" it says. \"You should register at the embassy or the consulate-general. In the case of the West Bank and Gaza, we would advise you to leave now, while exit routes remain open.\" Earlier this week, a 30-strong group of anti-war activists, including several Britons, left London on the first leg of a trip to Baghdad, where they plan to act as voluntary human shields. Last Sunday, a convoy carrying 75 members of the Truth Justice Peace Human Shield Action group arrived in the Iraqi capital after travelling 3,000 on double-decker buses. A third group of protesters, travelling by air, is due to leave London on Friday. Kuwait is being used as a mustering point for US and UK forces ahead of a possible military strike against Iraq."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
