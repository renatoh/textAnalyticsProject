Describing the idea as \"a dangerous thought but very interesting\", Geraldine Peacock said it was one way of the sector becoming financially independent of the government. Speaking at the Charities Aid Foundation national conference in London, she said: \"Small charities would be able to pool finance. So we will not have to look to the government to bail us out. We are capable of standing on our own two feet.\" Ms Peacock, who took up her position four months ago, also spoke about changes she would like to see to the system of charity trustees. She said charities in the UK needed good quality trustees, and in future she would like the commission to have a role in assessing their performance. If as part of improved governance proposed in the draft charities bill staff have to be appraised it was only fair and equal that the same sort of scrutiny should apply to trustees, she said. Ms Peacock also wanted the law to be changed to allow trustees time off work to devote to their charity work - along the same lines that employees are entitled to leave for jury service. She told the conference: \"Then we would get a greater age range of trustees - it's quite hard to recruit young people as trustees.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
