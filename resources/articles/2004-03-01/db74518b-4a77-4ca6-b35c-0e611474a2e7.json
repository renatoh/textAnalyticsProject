The Dutch duo are two of a number of experienced players whose contracts expire at the end of the season. Certainly some of that group will be leaving as McLeish attempts to reshape an underachieving squad into a winning unit once more. Henning Berg is to retire, Egil Ostenstad will return to Norway, while Michael Mols looks to be on his way after a disappointing season. The De Boer twins, playmaker Ronald and defender Frank, have made no secret of the fact that they have offers to play in Qatar next season. But McLeish insisted that no decision had yet been made, despite the duo being named as departees in the Rangers News this week. He said: \"That is not cast in stone. Their names were used in the papers and Rangers' own publication during the week but that has not been discussed. I think the general perception is that Ronald and Frank were going to the Middle East but we don't know about that.\" McLeish began the rebuilding process earlier in the week by telling Nuno Capucho, Emerson and Christian Nerlinger they were not in his long-term plans. McLeish said: \"I don't criticise players in public in terms of their ability and I certainly won't be starting that. \"I just feel we have to look ahead and try to develop younger players like Stevie Hughes and Gavin Rae as well as looking to add to the squad in the summer.\" McLeish insisted he had not been given an exact figure to spend on new players but was realistic enough to know it would not be a fortune. He said: \"There would be a wish-list if money were no object but I have to remain prudent and bring players in within the parameters. \"Certainly we will look at things a wee bit differently to the way we did last season.\" Hibernian are boosted by the return of Ian Murray and Yannick Zambernardi for the CIS Cup final against Livingston tomorrow. Murray has been missing since November with a stomach problem while his French team-mate has been out with a thigh injury for six months. But Stephen Glass has lost his battle to recover from a knee problem. Livingston have no injury or suspension worries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
