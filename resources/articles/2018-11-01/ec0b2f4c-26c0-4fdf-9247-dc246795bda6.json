The guidance does not say an investigation is mandatory in these circumstances, but it does say there is an expectation that such deaths will be reviewed (NHS to investigate deaths of all mental health patients, 27 November, page 21). \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Lady Trumpington, former Bletchley Park codebreaker, dies aged 96 Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s borrowed white privilege made his murder count Sapphic sensation: the rise of the lesbian story on and off screen Sir Aaron Klug obituary The Joy of Waterboiling: kettle cookbook wins oddest book title award"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
