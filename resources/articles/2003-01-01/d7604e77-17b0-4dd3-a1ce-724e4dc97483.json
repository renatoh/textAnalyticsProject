Yelland is leaving Britain's bestselling daily tabloid with immediate effect to study at a US business school and take up a senior management role at News International, the publisher of the Sun and the News of the World. \"David has had five fabulously successful years in the chair at the Sun. He bows out with an increasing circulation and with even greater distance between the Sun and its competition,\" Mr Murdoch said. \"David's great talent brought a depth and quality to the Sun that has placed it among the country's most respected voices. \"His skills will be missed there but I look forward to working with him in a senior role for years to come.\" Mr Murdoch also praised the talents of Rebekah Wade, who is taking over as editor of the Sun tomorrow after a successful two-year stint at the News of the World, where she has caused controversy with a campaign to \"name and shame\" known paedophiles. \"Rebekah has proven her talent as a great campaigning editor. She has produced a popular, powerful and often controversial News of the World. I am confident she will triumph again at the Sun,\" Mr Murdoch said. The News International executive chairman, Les Hinton, praised Yelland for doing \"a wonderful job at the helm of the world's best popular newspaper\", while describing Wade as \"one of the brightest young talents in Fleet Street\". Yelland joined News International in 1990 as the Sun's City editor before progressing to become the deputy editor of the New York Post and, in June 1998, the editor of the Sun. He said: \"It has been an exhilarating five years but personally and professionally I know this is the right time for a change. \"I had discussions with management late last year and we agreed this was the best time to make the move. \"I'm 40 this year - it's time for me to move on to the next stage in my career.\" Wade, 34, said: \"It's the best job in newspapers and I can't wait to get started.\" She also joined the company in 1990 as a feature writer on Sunday magazine, rising to become features editor of the News of the World in 1994, deputy editor in 1995, deputy editor of the Sun in 1998 and editor of the News of the World in 2000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
