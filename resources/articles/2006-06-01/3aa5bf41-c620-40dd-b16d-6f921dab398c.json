He is retiring. This will be his last Wimbledon and one of only five men to have won all four grand-slam titles will walk off court for the last time at the US Open, which starts on 28 August. Agassi wanted to make the announcement at the All England Club because 'this is where it all started for me, my dreams. So it's only right that I say it here. This championship has allowed me to grow into the player and person I am today and I have so many people to thank for that'. Within minutes, Agassi's seat in the Wimbledon press conference centre was being occupied by Rafael Nadal, who could possibly meet Agassi in the third round. He was five when Agassi won his first Wimbledon. 'No, I did not watch, but it was 1992, no?' said this bright young man from Majorca whose flamboyant appearance brings to mind the early longhaired Agassi. When asked about Agassi, Nadal was quick to seize on the defining period of the American's career. 'He's a legend, no? It is so difficult to go and come back and be as good as before. Mentally so tough to do that. Unbelievable.' Nadal, with his limited English, was right on the mark. Nothing became Agassi more than the way in which he accepted a startling slump in his world ranking to 142 in 1997. He proceeded to climb back up, beginning with the humiliation of playing an event on the secondtier tour. That experience, coupled with his marriage to Steffi Graf, changed Agassi who was genuinely surprised at how forgiving people were of his lapses in both taste and style. Graciousness was not always a trademark in his confused teenage years, but it is now and no one needs to tell Agassi how much he has changed. And, as he admitted, it hasn't been easy. 'I sort of grew up in the public eye and had to learn some tough lessons in front of a lot of people, one of which was to respect the greatest tournament in our sport. To miss it here for a number of years, to come back and be embraced, taught me a lot about what the human spirit is capable of. I started a journey at that stage to do my best to give back everything it had given to me. And, you know, it's been a journey. It's been a growing, learning experience.' Andy Murray may well be echoing those sentiments in a few years. The teenage Scot was next in the hotseat at Wimbledon yesterday, trying yet again to get the British media to understand his dry sense of humour. After dealing with questions about his first-round match against Chile's Nicolas Massu, someone he says he won't take lightly, Murray revealed that, despite his spiralling earnings, he has yet to buy a business-class ticket. 'I did get an upgrade out of Bangkok last year,' he said. 'I was in 89C or something and the guy gave me an upgrade. Maybe he fancied me.' That was a joke. Just like his flippant remark about wanting Paraguay to beat England. 'I try to be myself,' he sighed, 'but it's hard.' It was hard for Agassi, too, and Murray probably connected with that. Agassi has always been his hero and Murray was quite serious when he said that he had sweaty hands when he went on court to hit with him for the first time at Queen's two weeks ago. 'It's the only time I've been nervous on a practice court,' he said. 'He changed tennis and made it a cool sport worldwide. I think to lose someone like him is a shame for the game. I think it's going to feel a little bit different without him on the tour.' Nadal, just a year older than Murray, says he is fit again after the shoulder problem that forced him to withdraw from the Stella Artois. That may not be what Alex Bogdanovic wanted to hear, but the first-round meeting still offers a great opportunity for Britain's least fulfilled talent. The young Frenchman Richard Gasquet prepared for his Centre Court meeting with Roger Federer tomorrow by retaining his Nottingham Open title with a crisp 6-4 6-3 victory over a former Nottingham champion, Jonas Bjorkman. Eastbourne gets great final After several years of announcing as many withdrawals as participants, Eastbourne finally got a high-quality final, and a champion favoured to win Wimbledon. Justine Henin-Hardenne beat Anastasia Myskina 4-6 6-1 7-6 (7-5) in a match that can be trotted out as a PR video advertising the best in women's tennis. While Henin- Hardenne demonstrated the dying art of serve-volleying, Myskina fired her groundstrokes - particularly her two-fisted backhand - with the accuracy that took her to number two in the rankings two years ago. It made for a superb twohour contest, which Henin-Hardenne won with her fifth match point, but the first on her own serve. Henin-Hardenne is looking strong to complete her set of grand-slam titles a week on Saturday. Adios Andre: Agassi will retire after 2006 US Open.
