It is, in fact, raining as I type this. Am I going to stick a fork in my eye? Or jump off a bridge? Hell no! Seattle's best-kept secret is that it's usually a sunshiny 80F (27C) in the summer. It's cloudy and might rain? Yawn. Rain is easy. We don't even use umbrellas, because it's too difficult to carry a coffee and eat a sandwich walking with an umbrella. And coffee \u2013 our drug of choice \u2013 really is the most important thing you're ever carrying. Find the small dealers. The three Vs of coffee shops are: Vivace, Vita, and Victrola. These similarly named coffee houses are equally excellent roasters, with casual atmospheres. Any one of them is a perfect place to get a fix. Skip the original Starbucks in the Pike Place Market. Pike Place is miserable when crowded \u2013 it's only great on a week night, minutes before closing, when locals haggle for flowers and fish. At dusk, you may also run into Princess Angeline, daughter of Chief Si'ahl, aka Chief Seattle \u2013 one of several old souls that people claim to see wandering around the 100-year-old market after the sun drops behind the Olympic mountains. The Olympic peninsula, visible from Seattle's waterfront, is the first day trip you should consider. Hop on a ferry from Colman Dock (aka Pier 52) and drive straight to the Hoh Rain Forest. It's a long drive (about two hours from Port Angeles) but you won't be sorry, nor will you believe your eyes when you see this drippy, neon-green forest, which is thousands of years old and looks almost like it was put on Earth by aliens. Also on the peninsula, at Sequim, is the Olympic Game Farm, which has waving grizzly bears. No, really! Two gigantic real bears wave at you like prom queens in a 4th of July parade. Back in Seattle, the Capitol Hill neighbourhood is dense and walkable, and you can't throw a rock in any direction without hitting a restaurant or a shop. Try Momiji for sushi. For records it's Wall of Sound. The owners Jeffery Taylor and Michael Ohlenroth have impeccable taste for rarities and vinyl \u2013 from avant-garde Japanese noise to electro-acoustic - and share an \"all-killer, no-filler\" philosophy in stocking music for the store. The three-floor thrift store Value Village is probably Capitol Hill's best one-stop shop for everything else \u2013 cut-rate clothing, cookware and even art (like the photograph of a Canadian bodybuilder framed with his posing pouch that I saw here for $6). You might bump into Seattle rapper Macklemore. For live music, pop into Neumos for hip-hop, rock, and hipster faves or Chop Suey for scrappier punk, and garage. Bars worthy of a stop include Unicorn, which is tricked out in dizzying circus stripes with taxidermy on the walls; Bimbo's Cantina, which serves tacos and tequilas in booths under the gaze of Mexican wrestling masks and religious icons by staff who all play in rock bands on the side; and Bait Shop, a 70s-style diner whose wood-panelled walls are adorned with stuffed fish and nautical memorabilia and which sells Hemingway daiquiris alongside its fish and chips. The Pine Box is also worth a stop. It's a beer hall in a former mortuary. Bruce Lee's funeral was held here. Lee, now buried at Lake View Cemetery (also in Capitol Hill) alongside his son Brandon, is rumored to haunt the Pine Box, along with the ghost of a woman and a small boy. Capitol Hill is also Seattle's premier gay-bourhood. Gay marriage is legal. Civil rights are being honoured and celebrated citywide. Nowhere does the celebration shine more brightly than in a flower-shop-turned-gay-bar called Pony. Instead of being full of ghosts, Pony is full of hopes for the future. It's a magical place where everyone \u2013 gay, straight, and all shades in between \u2013 comes together. There's also a clothing-optional photo booth, vintage pornography everywhere, a stripper's pole and a glory hole in the bathroom \u2026 But I'll perhaps save those details for another story.
