At present, this old chestnut is typically applied by media publications to female 2012 athletes, who are marshalled into photoshoots billed as the last word in expectations-busting. You know the sort of thing \u2013 \"Britain's 2012 track hopes \u2013 as you've never seen them before\". Alas, the response to this promise is fast becoming: are they in their knickers? Or a Sexy Party Dress? Because I'm starting to feel that's the only way I ever see them. Scarcely a week now goes by without another big reveal, with recent efforts including a lingerie calendar starring various athletes, and the Daily Mail's weird \"sexy celestial\" themed picture of six female athletes \u2013 or an \"angels sextet\", as the paper called them with mid-mesozoic innuendo. At the so-called higher end, Harper's Bazaar carries a photospread in which several female athletes \u2013 including serial stripper-off Victoria Pendleton \u2013 gad about in glamorous gowns. Mind those gusts of wind, girls! Inevitably, 2012 was always going to be something of a limelight trolley dash for many athletes, who are presumably advised that the way to sponsors' hearts (and a more secure financial future) is to maximise their exposure in this extraordinary year. And even more inevitably, a wildly unimaginative media would try to shoehorn many of the female contingent into this niche. So forgive the return to one of my own old chestnuts, but it feels apposite to recall again that brilliant clip from the Onion News Network, which sees a breakfast TV showbiz reporter enthusing to her studio anchor about the red carpet event she attended the night before \u2013 the Fifth Annual Strong Women in Television Awards. She gushes about how honoured she'd been to present Best Fight Scene In a Wet T-shirt or Short Shorts to Evangeline Lilly of Lost \u2013 causing the anchor to concur approvingly. \"That's a woman who can be tough and independent while wearing a wet T-shirt!\" \"Jennifer Love Hewitt was there,\" the showbiz reporter goes on. \"We chatted away about how great it is that female characters can be sexy and tough, sexy and smart, sexy and professional \u2026 It was a great night for women and for the men who write for them.\" Well quite. The rash of as-you've-never-seen-them-before shoots with 2012 competitors is an uplifting confirmation of how female athletes can be sexy and good at triathlon, sexy and a medal hope, sexy and someone who's worked most of their life for this sporting moment. Perhaps this December, the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year ceremony could create a new category as a sop to some of those ladies overlooked by the all-male shortlist thrown up by last year's awards, which famously included submissions from Nuts and Zoo magazines. There's bound to be argument over the wording with such a hotly contested gong, but I'd go for Best Expression of Drive and Ambition While Wearing Keyhole Knickers. Political footballers Momentarily, it seemed we might have the presidential election to make the recent Irish one look sane. And considering the latter saw Martin McGuinness battling with the singer Dana, that would have been a feat. I speak, of course, of Eric Cantona's reported bid for the French presidency, which the mercurial former Manchester United legend sadly debunked mere hours after having announced it. It was a charity stunt, apparently \u2013 but it did set the mind dreaming as to whether this country would ever see a footballer run for high office. Twitter threw up plenty of nominations for 2011's breakout polymath, Joey Barton, while precedent-wise, someone mentioned the erstwhile Scotland first minister Henry McLeish, who got his start as a Leeds United youth player. Then of course there was CB Fry who, having represented his country at pretty much everything bar taekwondo, failed thrice to become the Liberal member for various constituencies (but claimed to have been offered the throne of Albania). At the very least, the next generation of football video games should include a mode in which a fantasy team of footballers assume various cabinet posts, and must respond to a series of political challenges, such as domestic terrorism, welfare restructuring, re-election, and war. Think of it as the logical evolution of Pro Evolution Soccer, and reflect that they probably couldn't make more of a Horlicks of it all than most politicians."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
