But a year or so after Britart.com began trading, private buyers are doing just that. And so confident is Britart that more of us can be persuaded to buy that it is relaunching its service supported by a new marketing campaign. Using the theme empty walls, Britart is running press ads and a direct mailing campaign which consists of a pocket-sized book of pictures taken of a variety of rooms featuring . . . empty walls. It's a lower key approach than last year's headline-catching outdoor advertising campaign created by fashionable ad agency Mother. That campaign used witty flyposters to turn the likes of lamp-posts and paving stones into public works of art, and won the top prize at this summer's prestigious D&amp;AD awards. But it's all part of Britart's ongoing philosophy of using the internet to make art more accessible. Given the dot.com downturn that has rocked all e-businesses in the months since Britart's launch, one could be forgiven for thinking that a niche proposition reliant on high income young professionals and art enthusiasts would be one of the first casualties. In fact, as Britart marketing director Richard Murphy explains, the desperate market conditions have provided the online gallery with a sharper focus. \"All e-businesses - us included - are on a knife edge,\" he says. \"The general perception that dot.coms were shit affected everyone in the sector looking for funding. By the time we came to do our second round of funding late last year the Nasdaq had dropped by 75%.\" As a result, Britart raised additional funding not from institutional backers but from \"angel investors\" and, Murphy readily admits: \"We didn't raise as much money as we had hoped.\" But, as he brightly points out: \"We're still here.\" Britart made great play of its founding philosophy when it launched: that the internet could be used to democratise art buying. It positioned itself as the antidote to traditional, staid art galleries where the uninitiated art buyer would be more likely to be patronised than welcomed. And it aimed to champion young British artists - typically, those one to five years out of art school - by fostering unknown talent and guaranteeing exposure. The ultimate aim, Murphy adds, was to expand the current original art market by bringing in newcomers. Mother's campaign theme involved the creation of a series of \"art-ilisers\" (labels). The most high profile was the flyposting campaign which used posters to turn street furniture into art. A second wave of advertising extended the theme into offices with art-ilisers designed to turn everyday office items into art. A third wave enabled consumers to art-ilise objects around their own home. Other items created as part of this marketing push included an Art Pencil - a special, boxed pencil sent to various potential buyers which promised anything drawn with it would be art. The off-beat style and tongue-in-cheek tone won Britart a disproportionate amount of media coverage. Around 200 pieces of art a month have been sold via Britart.com for prices ranging up to \u00a328,000. With some 400 artists on its books and around 3,000 pieces currently on sale, Britart still hopes to turn a profit by next year. \"Last year was very much about identifying ourselves and telling the world what we are,\" Murphy says. \"The Mother campaign came out of that. This year we want to address more specifically what it is that stops people from buying art. It's about changing the paradigm of the traditional art gallery by moving art buying away from being a lifestyle choice - an activity of an elite - and positioning it as a personal choice - a matter of taste.\" The new Britart.com site doesn't look much different from before, although it boasts a number of new features. For a start, private buyers now have a chance to self-select according to the types of magazine they read - wallpaper*, House &amp; Garden, Frieze (the art collectors' bible) - to receive advice on which art could be best suited for them. There's also a new service aimed at people wanting to buy art for their business. Again, users can receive suggestions of which works currently available might suit them according to the nature of their business or company style (\"conservative\", \"left of centre\" or \"avant garde\"). \"It means we won't put people off by offering someone who's into land or cityscapes installation work like one we have on sale at the moment featuring earthworms and fingers in a tank,\" Murphy says. Britart.com has also struck a deal with photographic specialists Proud Galleries, which works with photographers such as Rankin, to act as its online sales arm. It's certainly a challenge staying one step ahead in the online art market, Murphy concedes. For not only have most of the major galleries set up online, but there are also around 15 other online arts sales services currently operating in the UK. And as the last into the market, Britart must work hard to reinforce its points of difference. \"Despite the troubles that have hit the dot.com sector, it has been good to consolidate from a position of strength rather than let our ambitions run riot - which could have happened if the boom had carried on,\" he admits. \"It's a trust thing. We have to ensure people still believe we have the integrity to find the best artists but won't intimidate if buyers don't know anything about art - two things which we believe the internet has allowed us to do. They key will be to keep it simple and remain focused.\" With a fair wind, Britart hopes that within the next four or five years it will be financially sound enough to start expanding its horizons - overseas. But it is wary of simply \"going global\" just because the internet is a global medium. \"Although we are a web business it is important to build an understanding of what we do in the outside world,\" Murphy explains. \"There are international cities we'd like to approach - to create a presence that allows us to run events, put on shows and stage gigs. And as the voice of new and emerging British artistic talent, we believe there is scope to export this concept as a blueprint into other markets - to be the voice of artistic young America, and so on.\" In a dot.com world now characterised by more sober expectations, however, such grand ambitions are - for the time being, at least - just a dream."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
