So damn expensive. Take this nursery near Portsmouth. Maxine and Derek, the couple who run it, seem nice, dedicated to what they do. Their place is well set-up and equipped. But it costs fifty quid an hour. An hour! Who can afford those sort of prices in these sort of times? I'm not surprised they say business isn't brilliant. And how good are they, actually? I can't even find an Ofsted report on them. Which might have something to do with the fact that this is The 15-Stone Babies (Channel 4). It's not a good title. You'd expect it to be about how the obesity epidemic is spreading downwards in age \u2013 all the way down (\"Yes, we probably would recommend an epidural in your case, dear\"). But no, in fact we're talking so-called \"adult babies\", or ABs (remember when that was a socioeconomic group?). Now you are probably immediately thinking of people who get off on wearing nappies, etc. And there can be that element \u2013 it can be about sexual fetishism. \"For some adult babies, it's not just about the joy of going back to childhood,\" we're told. \"Nappies can be exciting [really?] and some nurseries offer sexual services. But Maxine sees herself as a more traditional mother \u2026\" What? As opposed to a more modern sex mother? I'm beginning to feel very traditional and old-fashioned myself. I like the kind of mums who make marmalade. Maxine admits that some of her male ABs can become aroused, but says: \"If someone's excited when I'm changing them, I often don't even notice ...\" Hmm, I think it's possible that perhaps Maxine is a teeny bit in denial about it mainly being about feeling comfy and safe. The fact that her and Derek's own sex life has a lot to do with nappies should be some kind of clue to what this is mainly about. And what about the S&amp;M dungeon Derek is building in the shed, because of the downturn in nursery bookings? I need to feel warm, and cosy, protected \u2026 so nail me to a cross and beat me until I beg for mercy! I'm probably making it sound more like a teehee, look-at-these-deviant-freaks kind of show than it is. Liz Allen's film is better than that. It's measured, sober, thoughtful, sensitive. She asks questions, and gets answers \u2013 frank, honest answers. All these people had difficult childhoods, or didn't really have childhoods at all. It's about making up for loss. For Maxine, it's about making up for lost babies (she had two miscarriages). Derek slips in that he once attempted suicide. There is a sadness as well as a seriousness to the film. It's not about despairing of humanity; more about discovering \u2013 and attempting to understand \u2013 a little-known corner of it. Ah good, Pensioners Behind Bars (ITV). Best place for them, I've always thought \u2013 keeps them off the buses, all smug with their bloody freedom passes ... Oh, they've been banged up not just for being old, but for being bad. Sixty-seven-year-old Anthony tried to claim more than half a million quid by faking his own death. Just the one question, Dead Anthony: how come your fingerprints are on your own death certificate? Send him down. Then there's Trevor, 61, in Norwich prison, moaning about the noise and the fact that a lot of the other prisoners are on drugs. Yeah, you probably sold the drugs to them, Trevor (he got caught with \u00a313,000 worth of cannabis, as well as thousands of illegal cigarettes). But Trevor's Mr Small (and Mr Young) compared to John in Aberdeenshire. John was a teetotal churchgoer until the age of 74, when he embarked on a new career, as a smack dealer. It's not just about bad old boys. Adele in Hendon used to be a driving instructor, and the wife of a Tory county councillor (like that's some kind of mark of respectfulness). But she wanted to work from home, so she trained and qualified as a masseuse. Most of her clients turned out to be men. \"Some people would say, 'Do you do happy ending?' and I had to say, 'Yeah, no problem' ...\" Er, hang on Adele, no you didn't! Nor did you have to employ girls to cope with the extra demand. Or convert all your rooms, and then take on another property \u2013 start a brothel empire, basically \u2013 in north London. She seems quite indignant, as if it was all a big mistake. Of course it was. Now lock her up, lock them all up. Old people today, they're a menace, aren't they?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
