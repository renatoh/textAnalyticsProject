From 20 October, the largest dimensions of the two existing small parcel formats will be combined to create a single, bigger format measuring 45cm x 35cm x 16cm, saving up to \u00a35.20 if the contents of a medium parcel can be fitted into the new small format. Royal Mail, which handles more parcels in the UK than any other company, is also running a Christmas price promotion on small parcels from 20 October until 18 January. Under the promotion, all second-class small parcels weighing up to 2kg will cost the same, \u00a32.80. This will knock \u00a31 off parcels weighing between 1kg and 2kg. Franked small parcels weighing between 1kg and 2kg will also benefit from a saving of \u00a31 at \u00a32.50 during the period of the promotion. First-class prices are remaining the same: \u00a33.20 for a small parcel weighing up to 1kg and \u00a35.45 for 1-2kg. Last month, Royal Mail launched a pilot of Sunday afternoon opening at around 100 of its delivery offices across the UK to make it easier for online shoppers not at home during the week to get their parcels. The initiative extends the opening of delivery offices with the highest parcel volumes to seven days a week. Royal Mail also began a trial of Sunday deliveries to addresses within the M25. MPs on the business select committee have launched an inquiry into claims that Royal Mail will struggle to fulfil its universal service obligation to deliver to every address in the country six days a week for the same price due to intense competition in profitable areas. Royal Mail is worried that rival operator Whistl, formerly known as TNT Post, is able to cherry-pick profitable delivery routes in big cities, while Royal Mail is legally required to provide the same service to all 29m UK addresses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
