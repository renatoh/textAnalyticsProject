Vardalos, who wrote and stars in the film, reprises her role as Toula, the browbeaten daughter of the overbearing Portokalos clan. Now, however, she has a 17-year-old daughter who is regularly mortified by the entire family turning up at the various landmark moments of her life. The supporting cast tend to bellow their lines as if they are trying to have a conversation across an eight-lane motorway, but volume of delivery fails to make up for the lack of comic polish. Scenes tend to fizzle out or end with an ancient granny wandering into shot brandishing some baklava. The wedding is a renewal of vows between Toula\u2019s parents; meanwhile, her father is convinced he\u2019s a direct descendent of Alexander the Great. Alexander the Grating, perhaps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
