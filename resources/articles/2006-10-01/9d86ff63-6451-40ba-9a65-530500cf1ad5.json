Specifically with The Sun Also Rises, or, as you Brits call it, Fiesta. The latter title being apposite, because part of what I carried away from that book in my youth was the sense that drinking wine was cool and sophisticated. And, let's face it, this is one of the reasons we read books, especially in our youth, especially books by Hemingway and Kerouac and Lawrence Durrell: to find out how to live and how to pose and where to travel and what to eat and drink and smoke along the way. Everybody in Hemingway's first novel was drinking wine. Not long after my vicarious week in Pamplona, this sense of wine as an appurtenance of the well-lived life was reinforced by Evelyn Waugh, specifically by Brideshead Revisited Charles Ryder and Sebastian Flyte picturesquely draining the cellar at Brideshead over the course of that summer. I was so fixated on the wine and the scenery I don't think I ever grasped the nature of their friendship. Not very Hemingwayesque, but again, for some reason I remember the wine. The fact that wine had no place on my parents suburban dining table seemed to confirm the assessment that its consumption was a mark of sophistication. My parents and their friends drank cocktails - martinis, Manhattans, Old Fashioneds and Stingers. And when they drank enough of them they behaved badly, especially when they were in their Stingers period, though not in a way that I thought of as romantic or chic. Much later I realised that they behaved like the people in John Cheever's stories, although I hadn't read Cheever then and in fact it took me years to appreciate his writing, in part because his characters resembled my parents and their friends. Hemingway was a great fan of Spanish rosado, which may be one reason that on my very first date, at the age of 16, I ordered a bottle of Mateus ros\u00e9, the spritzy Portuguese pink that came in a Buddha-shaped bottle. Never have I felt quite so worldly as I did that night at the Log Cabin Inn at Lenox, Massachusetts, as I sniffed the cork and nodded to the waiter. Many of my college romances were initiated over a bottle of Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, the only name I could remember, but when I arrived in New York after graduation I became a fan of quicker fixes, partly in the semi-conscious belief, imparted to me by so much of my reading, that the road of excess would lead me to the palace of wisdom, that the pursuit of an artistic, and specifically a writing career required a strict regimen of Dionysian excess. New York City in the early 1980s was a congenial setting for this particular aesthetic programme and for an aspiring writer whose role models included Baudelaire, Dylan Thomas, Keith Richards and Tom Verlaine. I worked as a freelance book reviewer and, briefly, as a fact checker for the New Yorker even as I did my best to infiltrate the downtown nightclub scene, which I imagined to be the contemporary equivalent of Isherwood's Berlin or Lautrec's Montmartre. Until one morning, not long after I was fired from the New Yorker, when I was awakened at the crack of 2pm by a call from my best friend, who informed me that Raymond Carver was on his way to my apartment. You could have knocked me over with a rolled up 20-dollar bill, several of which were lying on my bedside table. Jesus Christ. Raymond Carver at my doorstep. Granted, there was some context here: my best friend, Gary Fisketjon was a junior editor at Random House and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Carver's editor Gordon Lish. (He was later to become Carver's editor, as well as my own.) When we were at Williams College together some years before, I had lent Gary a book called Will You Please Be Quiet, Please and ever since then we had both been passionate fans of Carver. Now Gary was returning the favour with interest. He'd had lunch with Carver and Lish; he and Lish had to put in some office time, and Carver had nothing to do until his reading at Columbia that night, so Gary volunteered my services as a tour guide for the afternoon, assuming that I would be thrilled. Which I was, although I had a splitting headache. The buzzer rang, a faint indistinct mumble came through the intercom - and then the doorway was filled by this hulking, slouching bear who mumbled indistinctly as I ushered into him into my tiny Greenwich Village apartment, which showed all the signs of a long, recently terminated binge. We never got around to that tour of the city. We talked for four or five hours, until it was well past time to get Carver to his reading. Mostly we talked about writing, but at some point Carver said, almost apologetically, \"I don't know, it doesn't look like the life you're living here is exactly conducive to writing.\" It didn't take a master storyteller to make this observation but it struck me as a bit of an epiphany. Carver knew whereof he spoke, a devotee of Alcoholics Anonymous who credited that organisation with saving his life. Six months' later I had moved to Syracuse to study with Carver and clean up my act. To supplement my fellowship, which paid tuition plus four thousand dollars a year, I took a job as a clerk at the Westcott Cordial Shop. The neighbourhood was a marginal one, situated between the university and the ghetto, and while we displayed bottles of vintage Bordeaux - I specifically remember the bottle of 78 Smith Haut Lafite with its blue and yellow label - they tended to collect dust; much of our trade was in the area of industrially fortified grape juice, selling Wild Irish Rose and Night Train to guys with bad personal hygiene. I rode out a couple of stick-ups at gunpoint. Still, the proprietor was a Princeton man who had an extensive wine library on the premises and high hopes for the eventual gentrification of the neighbourhood. I used to dip into the wine library between robberies and grad-school assignments, oscillating over the course of a shift between Hugh Johnson's World Atlas of Wine and the stories of Isaac Babel. And I used to dip into the stock when I left at night, it being the tradition among the clerks to supplement our paltry paycheques with the odd bottle of Yugoslavian cabernet. I worked my way up from the cheapest bottles of eastern European table wine - we had quite a few in the two-dollar range - all the way to the Spanish bubbly (cava), which at the time cost five or six bucks. It wasn't a bad way to learn. After my first novel was accepted for publication I was able to afford a few of those vintage Bordeaux. By then I had developed the start of a palate. In Between Meals, AJ Liebling makes the case for starting near the bottom of the food chain. \"If the first requisite for writing well about food is a good appetite,\" he says, \"the second is to put in your apprenticeship as a feeder when you have enough money to pay the check but not enough to produce indifference about the size of the total.\" The same can be said of wine. The poor man, the budget drinker, is forced to make choices and sacrifices that can only sharpen his discrimination and his appreciation of competing pleasures. Starting at the top, one will miss out on the climb. Bad as some of the wine I was swiping from the shelves was, it was an improvement, in an aesthetic and toxicological sense, from the harder stuff to which I subscribed in my early years in Manhattan. Oenophilia was a way of channelling the hedonistic impulse, of refining and intellectualising it to some extent. Fermented grape juice is a far more potent catalyst for contemplation and meditation than a high ball, or an eight ball. I've heard nutritionists distinguish between good fats and bad fats, and I propose a similar dichotomy for intoxicants. You'd never guess wine was an intoxicant on the basis of the books and journals I was reading in the store, but I was beginning to suspect that it could provide intellectual as well as sensual pleasure, that it might be an inexhaustible subject or nexus of subjects - geology, meteorology, botany, history, aesthetics. And of course, literature. I had Hemingway and Waugh behind me on this point. \"Wine is one of the most civilised things in the world,\" Hemingway wrote in Death in the Afternoon, \"and one of the most natural things of the world that has been brought to the greatest perfection, and it offers a greater range for enjoyment and appreciation than, possibly, any other purely sensory thing.\" Not his greatest prose, perhaps, and like so many encomiums to wine - earnest Thomas Jefferson springs to mind - you feel that it leaves out the buzz factor, but still, it impressed me at the time. It was at the Westcott Cordial Shop that I received both the phone call announcing that my first novel had been accepted for publication and the subsequent one from a guy who kept calling me \"babe\" and wanted to fly me out to Hollywood to meet with his fellow executives at Paramount, my girlfriend having passed on the number to both callers. (\"We'll put you up at the Chateau Marmont,\" the Paramount exec told me. \"Is that good?\" I asked. \"Is it good? John Belushi died there.\" Clearly he had read the book, or at least the coverage of the book, and formed an opinion of my habits.) The night of the first phone call I purchased that dusty bottle of 78 Smith Haut Lafite, and while, objectively speaking, it was far from the best Bordeaux I have ever had in my life, I don't for a minute believe that wine appreciation is a strictly objective enterprise: I've gotten far less pleasure out of more expensive and highly regarded bottles of Bordeaux in the years since. Heraclitus tells us you can never step into the same river twice \"for other waters are ever flowing on to you\". Likewise, you can never really drink the same wine twice. The appreciation of wine, for all that we may try to quantify it, is, in the end, a subjective experience. More than a poem or a painting or a concerto, which are problematic enough for the aesthetician, the 1982 La Mission, say, or the 1999 Beaucastel, is a moving target. Not only does good wine continue to grow and develop in the bottle and in the glass, to change from one day to the next in response to barometric pressures and other variables, but our appreciation of any given wine from the same maker and the same vintage, even from the same barrel, is subject to our own quirks of receptivity, to the place and the company in which we drink it, to the knowledge we bring with us, and the food with which we pair it. In order to develop an appreciation for wine, it's true, we agree to the objective fiction; we attempt to isolate it from contextual variables, to treat the glass in front of us as if it contains a stable and quantifiable substance. We Americans are particularly prone to this view. One American wine critic in particular has been accused of reducing wine in its infinite variety and complexity to a numbers game. On the other hand, self-proclaimed Wine Advocate Robert Parker helped to democratise and demystify what was until very recently a stuffy, arcane and elitist branch of knowledge. Parker's belief that wine was a consumer product which could be evaluated and graded like any other was hugely liberating for those of us on both sides of the Atlantic who wanted to penetrate the mysteries of the great French growths. And it took a middle-class American lawyer who'd grown up drinking Coca-Cola with meals to begin to clear away the musty upper-class stench of oenophilia. It's true that Americans can be monomaniacs; despite Thomas Jefferson's best efforts to wean his countrymen off whiskey and brandy, wine has never been part of our culture as it has been in Europe, and American oenophiles can often seem like zealous and narrow-minded converts to a broad and pantheistic faith. Fortunate for me, then, that the crucial phase of my initiation into the cult of Bacchus took place in Britain. Having left the liquor store after my first novel came out, I was in London for the English publication of the book, where my editor Liz Calder threw a party for me. Among the guests was Julian Barnes, whose Flaubert's Parrot I had just finished reading. I met many writers I admired that night, including some I remain friendly with, and some who would have seemed temperamentally more compatible, somehow between the lobbing of compliments back and forth across the net we stumbled upon our common interest in wine. A few nights later I found myself chez Barnes. When I arrived he had decanted two bottles of what I would later realise were legendary Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, the 1962 and the 1967 Jaboulet les C\u00e8dres. I didn't have much respect for Ch\u00e2teauneuf at the time because it was the red wine with which I used to ply my dates in college, and by then I thought of it as a beginner's wine. As soon as I tasted the '67 I realised I had a lot to learn. Julian was a year or two ahead of me in terms of his vinous education and his collecting - already he had a pretty significant cellar, composed mainly of clarets and Rh\u00f4nes. Subsequently, I realised that drinking with Julian was like playing tennis with a superior player - the best possible way to learn and to sharpen your game. He was also a better tennis player at the time. My nascent friendship with Julian coincided with the invention of the fax machine. He had one - odd, given what a technophobe he is, that he beat me to it - and I soon acquired one. We both distrusted the telephone and found this new medium - mediated and written, yet instantaneous - to be congenial. In between my visits to London and his to America we began to fax each other regularly. Our correspondence covered many topics - literary gossip, notes on our reading, my own romantic mishaps. But always there was wine. We inevitably shared notes on what we'd been drinking and buying, who we'd been drinking it with, and what had been said in the course of the evening. At Julian's table, in addition to meeting some of the more interesting literary figures in England, I also met some serious grape nuts, including Jancis Robinson MW and her husband Nick Lander, who then owned my favourite London restaurant and now writes about restaurants and food for the FT. One of the things you picked up from Jancis, or at least I did, was that wine should be kept in its place as part of the meal and part of the conversation, that it shouldn't dominate like some braying drunken uncle at a family dinner. Auberon Waugh was another oenophile I met at Barnes's table, and though I initially thought of him as the son of the author of Brideshead and the author of a rather fierce Private Eye parody of one of my novels, I soon made the acquaintance of his book Waugh on Wine, to my mind his finest achievement. As a guest he was always vague and complimentary about the wine. \"Red, I should say. Very nice.\" Not so in print. Some years later, when a friend of mine became editor of a magazine and asked if I would consider writing a wine column, it was Waugh's example that emboldened and inspired me. Jancis was a goddamn Master of Wine, and it was already too late to catch up with someone like her, even if I didn't already have a day job. But Bron was a happy amateur. Well, not necessarily happy. Gleefully nasty, perhaps. In his essay \"Perils of Being a Wine Writer\", he declares: \"Wine writing should be camped up. The writer should never like a wine; he should be in love with it; never find a wine disappointing but identify it as a mortal enemy, an attempt to poison him; sulphuric acid should be discovered when there is the faintest hint of sharpness. Bizarre and improbable side tastes should be proclaimed: mushrooms, rotting wood, black treacle, burned pencils, condensed milk, sewage, the smell of French railway stations or ladies underwear.\" None of these seems that improbable to me, and as a wine writer I consider Waugh a forebear, although I have to admit I am more of a lover than a killer. Another literary curmudgeon whose advice I keep in mind is Kingsley Amis. \"When I find someone I respect writing about an edgy nervous wine that dithered in the glass, I cringe. When I hear someone that I don't respect talk about an austere unforgiving wine, I turn a bit austere and unforgiving myself ... You can call a wine red, and dry, and strong and pleasant. After that, watch out ...\" When my name was first proposed as a possible wine columnist, I'm told that eyebrows were raised and jaws were dropped. Certain people apparently tapped their nostrils ominously, my qualifications as a hedonist being judged incompatible with any claim of being an oenophile. Even in ostensibly sophisticated circles, Americans are more puritanical than their English and Continental peers, and if I had had to defend myself in front of that particular jury of my peers I think I would have done the classic American mea culpa. I would confess that I used to snort and drink and dance the hoochie coo until I found my own personal saviour. Wine saved me from the demon rum and the devil's dandruff and a whole lot of other bad habits. It lowered my cholesterol and made me kinder to my children and my pets. Wine has led me to some of the more beautiful parts of the world and brought me into contact with some of the more stimulating and congenial eccentrics of our time. Wine people are as a rule gregarious, generous and passionate. The cult of Bacchus doesn't include many anal-retentive personalities. Much as I have ostensibly learned in 10 years since I started writing about wine, I'm not sure that I have ever enjoyed a wine more than I enjoyed that bottle of Mateus ros\u00e9 back in the summer of 1973. I had just acquired my driver's licence and I was in the company of my first love; the night and, beyond it, the entire summer stretched out ahead of me like a river full of fat, silvery pink-fleshed fish. And that was what the wine tasted like. It tasted like summer. \u00b7 Jay McInerney's latest book is A Hedonist in the Wine Trade, is published next week by Bloomsbury price \u00a314.99"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
