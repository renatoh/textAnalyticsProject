They face Italy in Rome on Saturday with the flanker continuing as captain even though Sam Warburton is expected to be fit again. Jones, who captained Wales for a record 30th time in Paris, led from the front and with the victory ending a run of eight straight defeats, the interim head coach Robert Howley named an unchanged team more than a week before the scheduled announcement. \"England are in pole position after winning their opening two matches, but they have some big fixtures coming up,\" said Jones. \"I would not write off France and they have us at the Millennium Stadium last up. We are still in the hunt after recovering from the defeat to Ireland and that is the main thing.\" Warburton, who withdrew from the side to face France because of a shoulder injury, will be named on the bench for Rome if he proves his fitness this week and Jones expects to hand back the armband to him sooner rather than later. \"You only ever look after the captaincy for someone else and I would not have been hurt if I had not been named to lead the side in Rome,\" said the 31-year old Jones. \"The issue for me was being picked in the team; the disappointment is always being left out. \"Sam is the squad captain and he is a kid with a bright, bright future. I have huge respect for him as a player, captain and bloke and cannot believe the reaction that has blown up over him. He will fight his way through this and like a lot of the younger players in the squad, his career sky-rocketed early on. They have all had to cope with the other side. \"The best players earn the world have long careers by learning how to weather storms and not going to either end of the extreme in victory or defeat. I have been around a while and as an older guy I am coming to the table and betting all-in every time, not torturing myself mentally. \"What this Wales team has, and this was evident in the second-half against Ireland, is heart. The players gave everything in Paris and the look on their faces at the end said it all for me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
