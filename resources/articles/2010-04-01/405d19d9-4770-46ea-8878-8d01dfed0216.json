The first black man to play for England, twice a European Cup winner, who lived, played and managed through 25 of English football's most dramatic years and worked with Brian Clough and Sir Alex Ferguson, Anderson should not want for material. But his memory does appear to be a genuine issue. While on the subject of his spell as Middlesbrough's assistant manager, he writes: \"My biggest recollection during this period ... was winning 3-2 at Old Trafford, though I'd be hard-pressed to give you any details of the game ... to be honest, I can't remember it.\" On a couple of occasions he tells a story and then, a few pages later, he tells it to you again, like a boorish drunk uncle. He rushes through major incidents with indecent haste and then lingers over minor ones. His descriptions of matches are bewilderingly sparse. European Cup finals come and go in the space of two sentences. Sheffield Wednesday's run to the 1993 FA Cup final, which featured a historic semi-final derby against Sheffield United, gets 19 words: \"Wednesday began to progress in the FA Cup. So much so, we made it all the way to Wembley.\" That's it. He is at his best, then, when he isn't talking about events but about issues and individuals. There is race, though it is not as dominant as the title might imply. The dust jacket trumpets the \"explosive climax\" in which Anderson \"lifts the lid\" on England's 2018 World Cup bid, a section which is impressively blunt (even if it is in chapter one). He writes well about the breakdown of his marriage and has a winning comedy hatred of Liverpool. But he has been let down not only by the mists of his own memory but by bizarre editorial decisions and errors. The final chapter is almost entirely composed of his predictions for this summer's World Cup, all of which will become irrelevant within weeks of publication. There are factual and grammatical errors. Absurdly, on the top of every other page in the entire book his name is misspelt as \"Viv Andserson\". His autobiography could, should, have been among the best, but a man who made a career out of consistency and reliability could not bring the same qualities to this book.
