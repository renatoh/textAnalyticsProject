A poll in yesterday's Yedioth Ahronoth found that 59% of Israeli voters said they backed the pullout from Gaza and 89% said that the security forces had handled it well in the face of widespread verbal abuse from settlers, including being called Nazis. The prime minister, Ariel Sharon, also benefited, with 61% of voters saying he had provided good leadership on the issue. The main centres of resistance in Gaza to the pullout have now been emptied, leaving only two small pockets of ultra-nationalist and messianic Jews in the West Bank settlements of Sa Nur and Homesh. The army says it will tackle them next week. By the time the operation was put on hold for the Jewish sabbath yesterday, about 1,300 families had left their homes under duress or been carried out by the largest Israeli security operation since the invasion of Lebanon in 1982. The army says it expects the Gaza strip to be completely cleared of the 8,000 settlers who once lived there by Monday or Tuesday, less than a week after it began, after which the military will turn its attention to the selected West Bank settlements. Before the operation began, Israel's defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, predicted that it would take three weeks. Earlier, the army had said it would be twice as long. The speed and relative ease of the pullout - with the settlers' predictions of mayhem and civil war failing to be realised - revived Israeli public support for Mr Sharon's disengagement plan after a slump ahead of the withdrawal. Israeli forces cleared away burning barricades to move into Gadid settlement yesterday, where several families and a few dozen ultra-nationalist youths were holding out in the synagogue. They were swiftly detained but seven escaped by kicking out the back window of the bus carrying them back into Israel and sought to hide in a neighbouring Palestinian enclave, Al-Mawasi. Two were caught and the Israeli army appealed to the Palestinians to turn over the rest. Israel also began the first demolitions yesterday with the crushing of brick houses and trailer homes in Kerem Atzmona. The Palestinians will then demolish what remains. Infrastructure and public buildings, such as community halls and council offices are to be left intact. Mr Sharon said he will visit the emptied settlements next week. The prime minister told Yedioth Ahronoth yesterday that watching the forced removal of the settlers from Kfar Darom on Thursday was one of the saddest days of his public life. But he said his sadness turned to rage later in the day as he watched defiant young Jews barricade themselves on the roof of Kfar Darom synagogue and attack the police with acid and paint. \"This is a bunch of wild people sent to Kfar Darom by the various eye-rollers [hypocrites] in an attempt to prevent physically the implementation of the decisions of government and parliament.\" Mr Sharon repeated his assertion that he has no plans to clear more settlements once the withdrawal from Israel's Gaza and northern West Bank colonies is complete. He said he would instead wait for the Palestinians to \"put an end to terror\" before there is a return to the US-led \"road map\". Palestinians celebrated the clearing of the settlements yesterday. In Rafah, hundreds of Palestinians gave a prayer of thanks outside a gate leading to Peat Sadeh settlement, now empty of residents with just a few soldiers on guard. The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, said Israel's withdrawal is the result of the sacrifices of Palestinian \"martyrs\", a term used to refer to those killed in the conflict including suicide bombers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
