I used FedEx, selecting them from the various quotes on the ParcelHero price comparison website. I paid \u00a368 for the delivery, which was a parcel of kids\u2019 clothes and snacks worth about \u00a3200 which was supposed to be delivered by the end of June/start of July. By August the parcel had not been delivered. In September Parcel Hero emailed me to say my friend in Cairo had refused to pay an additional \u00a3390 in \u201cduties\u201d and therefore it had not been delivered. I was told to pay the \u00a3390 or have it returned to me at a cost of \u00a3390 plus a \u00a3340 return charge. Or I could have it destroyed \u2013 and still be expected to pay \u00a3390. I have tried to reason with ParcelHero but it is threatening to charge my account and the card that was used to pay the original delivery fee. ER, London This week, the parcel was finally delivered. The baby food has gone off, the snacks are in crumbs and the baby boy has already outgrown the clothes you sent four months ago. And this was only after we intervened. FedEx has offered not to charge you for the duties. How could a \u00a3200 package attract Egyptian customs duties of \u00a3390? In truth, they did not. Customs duties were actually \u00a3120, not \u00a3390. What bumped up the cost so massively were a whole raft of other fees. FedEx wanted \u00a3105 for \u201cstorage\u201d of the box while it was undelivered, a \u201ccertificate and approval fee\u201d, a \u201cbrokerage\u201d fee, an \u201cMTS bank fee\u201d, a \u201cpostal licence fee\u201d and a \u201cpayment in advance\u201d fee. Despite your pressing, you could not get an answer for what most of these meant. And on top of that, it added local VAT. When ParcelHero contacted you in September it said the total cost was now \u00a3390. We approached ParcelHero first, as you paid them the \u00a368 delivery fee. It says it was not responsible for fees applied by any country\u2019s customs agency and thought the fees over and above the underlying customs duties \u201cdon\u2019t seem entirely unreasonable\u201d. We pressed FedEx for answers, and it says: \u201cWe have been in direct contact with our customer in order to resolve the matter.\u201d In other words, they had delivered the parcel, late and with no further offer of compensation or even money back for having taken so long. It appears the parcel had been held in bonded storage at Cairo airport, and that obtaining customs clearance from both pharmaceutical and food agencies held things up. But you were not told why it took so long to contact you, and why you were left in a catch-22 situation of paying what you regarded as an extortionate amount to release the parcel, or a similar amount to destroy it.
