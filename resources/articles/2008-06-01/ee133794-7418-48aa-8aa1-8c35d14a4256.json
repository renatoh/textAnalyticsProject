The worst possible day, in fact, because the school isn't going to cancel the event - it's not actually raining, after all - but we all know, in our hearts, that the heavens are going to open at some point, probably just as the reception kids get going with their hard-boiled eggs and spoons. \"The forecast is excellent for the afternoon,\" the primary school head says, totally unconvincingly, as we drop the children off. Each child is clutching a huge array of clobber, since all seasons must be catered for - my nine-year-old, Theo, has two bags filled with water bottles, sun cream and cap for if it's hot, rainproof coat, tracksuit bottoms and wellies for if it's wet. Come lunchtime, inevitably, the weather is no clearer. The mums and dads, released reluctantly from their offices for the afternoon, set off, again weighed down with every possible prop for every possible weather variation. Just as we arrive, big heavy drops of rain start to fall. One race is half-heartedly organised; a child falls over on the wet grass, and the decision is made to cancel the rest of the afternoon. Pupils can go straight home with their parents. In my 12 years as a parent with school-age kids, I've known a lot of cancelled sports days - and this year's, given how wet it has been, was no surprise. In some ways I wonder why the tradition remains so strong, since as a concept it obviously harks back to another age, in which sports were central to a school's notion of what it was. And yet, I'm glad we persist in holding on to it, somehow: it's one of those occasions, after all, that pulls children, staff and parents together in a whole-school setting. There was a camaraderie. No winners, but no losers either, and a lot of happy kids, who'd enjoyed the adventure of it - even if they did end up trailing a mile with everything bar the kitchen sink in their backpacks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
