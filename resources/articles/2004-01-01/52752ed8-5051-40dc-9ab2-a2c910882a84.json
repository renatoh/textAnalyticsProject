Ferries and cruise ships have also had to be on their guard. At a press conference to launch Cunard's new cruise ship, the Queen Mary 2, Micky Arison, chairman and chief executive of Cunard owner Carnival Corporation, said that the industry had reacted more quickly after 11 September than airlines. Companies immediately began to scan 100 per cent of the luggage taken on board, long before airlines adopted the measure. Before the event, both industries conducted only random screening of passengers' bags. At the annual Passenger Shipping Association dinner last November, Admiral Sir Alan West, the First Sea Lord, said the threat of terrorism had been of growing concern to the passenger shipping industry. He speculated that cruise ships were potential floating targets. It was not paranoia; last September, 14 ferries were delayed after a security alert in the port of Dover caused by a suspect pack age that had to be investigated by an Army bomb disposal unit. Three men were later charged. When the QM2 makes her maiden passenger voyage on Tuesday, there will be no scenes of families lining the quays, waving flags and cheering as their relatives leave port. Maybe people have lost interest in such departures, but the threat of terrorism has led to more severe restrictions on access to the docks. The dock gate was closed for the inauguration ceremony on Thursday, and tomorrow the public will not be able to get to the quayside and will have to make do with a small inside spectator gallery. A Cunard spokesman said: 'There are strict regulations and security is very tight.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
