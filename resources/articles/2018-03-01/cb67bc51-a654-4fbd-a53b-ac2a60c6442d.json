Back-to-back defeats by Scotland and France have led to England relinquishing their Six Nations title and slipping to No 3 in the world rankings, and a loss to Ireland would mean three defeats in a rowin the competition for the first time since 2006. It would also be a first defeat at Twickenham under Eddie Jones and could mean England finish the tournament in fifth place. Victory, however, would move England back up to No 2 in the world behind New Zealand. \u201cI\u2019m motivated by finishing the tournament on a high after two disappointments,\u201d Hartley said. \u201cI\u2019m motivated by showing the rugby world that we\u2019re still a good team. We do that by beating the current Six Nations champions.\u201d England\u2019s 18-match winning run was brought to a halt by Ireland 12 months ago, Joe Schmidt\u2019s side denying Hartley and co a second successive grand slam in the process. That was a first defeat for Hartley as the England captain and while revenge has not come into the hooker\u2019s thinking, he admits there is a desire to stop Ireland clinching what would be only their third clean sweep. \u201cWe want to finish the tournament strongly, we don\u2019t want Ireland to win a grand slam,\u201d Hartley added. \u201cIt would be a reward for this team to finish the tournament on a high because there\u2019s not a game the following week to come in and train [for] and improve and review, and to then go out and try and execute. This is our last game for a while together so we want to finish on a high.\u201d Hartley returns to the side after missing the 22-16 defeat by France because of a calf injury. That allowed Jamie George a first Six Nations start but once Hartley had proved his fitness, Jones wasted no time in calling on the captain in his most radical team selection to date. Hartley\u2019s captaincy has been questioned of late, particularly because he is habitually withdrawn around the hour mark, but he insisted he has no doubts over his international future. \u201cI didn\u2019t think like that. I just controlled what I could and looked after myself and here I am,\u201d he said. \u201cI have got to come in and execute my role. I have got to make sure that 85-90% of my game is all about me and then the other 10% is the captaincy. If I focus on myself in delivering first and foremost then that\u2019s the best form of leadership.\u201d Jones has made 10 changes in total \u2013 three positional \u2013 including at least one in each row of the scrum. Kyle Sinckler makes his first England start, George Kruis has replaced Joe Launchbury, and James Haskell and Sam Simmonds come in for the injured Nathan Hughes and Courtney Lawes. \u201cI\u2019d say they are angry and I\u2019d say they\u2019re competitive as well,\u201d said England\u2019s scrum coach, Neal Hatley. \u201cOur training is competitive every day because people are scrapping for places. There\u2019s obviously a certain bit of anger over what\u2019s happened across the last two weeks, which is what you\u2019d expect.\u201d Hatley acknowledged Mako Vunipola takes on a greater ball-carrying responsibility in the absence of Hughes and Lawes but does not believe he is showing signs of fatigue in a gruelling season that has followed the British &amp; Irish Lions tour of New Zealand. \u201cWe ask Mako to carry the ball a lot,\u201d said Hatley. \u201cI think we were talking about it with Eddie the other day \u2013 he finishes games making 15, 16 carries, 18 tackles and however many scrums, lineouts, clean-outs. A lot is asked in international rugby of our props, particularly a ball-carrying prop like Mako. It\u2019s an intense game and the way that Mako likes to play is high-speed. I think he\u2019s coped unbelievably well with the workload.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
