Venezuela\u2019s supreme court had barred three opposition legislators and one pro-government lawmaker from taking office pending an investigation into alleged voting irregularities in the 6 December legislative election that handed the opposition control of the National Assembly for the first time in 17 years of Venezuela\u2019s socialist-oriented government. But opposition leaders, claiming that the ruling was aimed at limiting their majority in the assembly, defied the court and swore in the three contested deputies all the same. Upping the ante, the supreme court ruled this week that congressional decisions would be null until the swearing-in of the three was overturned. \u201cWe completely reject that ruling,\u201d the letter from the three opposition deputies said. But they added that by bowing out, they could \u201chelp free parliament from the institutional ambush [the government] want to lead it into\u201d. Government lawmakers cheered the turnaround by opposition leaders as a \u201cvictory for the people\u201d. \u201cWe face a new scenario now,\u201d said leading pro-government deputy, and former assembly president, Diosdado Cabello. \u201cFortunately for the country [the opposition] backed off.\u201d Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, head of the Datanalisis polling firm, said the decision was \u201cpolitically correct\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a strategically correct decision which causes anger because it is unfair, but it opens the game that had no other way of being unblocked,\u201d he wrote on his Twitter feed. Venezuela\u2019s political standoff pits the socialist government of President Maduro against a coalition of mostly centre-right parties known as MUD, which has said it would use its legislative majority to reverse some of the policies it says have driven Venezuela\u2019s economy to the ground. With the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, Venezuela\u2019s economy is facing meltdown as crude prices continue to plunge and internal price and exchange controls keep a chokehold on manufacturing. A deep recession and spiraling inflation fueled the discontent with Maduro and handed the opposition its December election victory. With the deadlock in the assembly over, Maduro\u2019s government is expected to present legislators with an emergency package to try to salvage the economy, although analysts doubt that it will be the kind of overhaul that the country needs. Through its majority in the assembly, the opposition hopes to steer the country in a different direction and some parties in the opposition coalition have also said they would use their majority in congress to cut short Maduro\u2019s term through a recall referendum. \u201cThe challenges that the opposition faces are complex and the game is just starting,\u201d wrote Le\u00f3n. \u201cThe difference from the past is that now (the opposition) is playing and not sitting on the bench.\u201d Maduro is due to address the assembly on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
