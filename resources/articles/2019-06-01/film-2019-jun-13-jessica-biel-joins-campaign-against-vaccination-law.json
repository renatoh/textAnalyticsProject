According to the Los Angeles Times, officials estimate that about 40% of the 11,500 medical exemptions requested each year would be denied under the bill, which is currently under review. Posting on Instagram, Kennedy had applauded Biel\u2019s efforts, calling her \u201ccourageous\u201d and for her to be applauded for \u201ca busy and productive day\u201d. Kennedy is chairman of Children\u2019s Health Defense, an organisation that explicitly opposes the bill. In another photo, Kennedy and Biel posed with Democratic Assembly member Autumn Burke, with Biel commenting: \u201cGreat meeting with both of you today.\u201d In an interview with the Daily Beast, Kennedy called Biel \u201ca very effective advocate\u201d, as well as \u201cvery strong and very knowledgeable\u201d. He said he would not label Biel \u201canti-vaxx\u201d, calling that term \u201cpharmaceutical propaganda\u201d and \u201ca lie\u201d, adding instead: \u201cI would say that she was for safe vaccines and for medical freedom.\u201d Biel had not previously spoken in public on the issue, but in 2015 it was reported that she had declined to vaccinate her son with husband Justin Timberlake. Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation called \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d one of the 10 worst health threats facing humanity. \u201cThe reasons why people choose not to vaccinate are complex,\u201d says the organisation, citing \u201ccomplacency, inconvenience in accessing vaccines, and lack of confidence\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
