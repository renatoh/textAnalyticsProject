Rumours of divisions behind the scenes have plagued St Mary's in recent months and the new director of football and head coach have wiped the slate clean at the top end of the club. The caretaker manager Dave Bassett, the first-team coach Dennis Rofe and the goalkeeping coach David Coles left yesterday, while Redknapp's assistant manager Kevin Bond was already on gardening leave. In their place Burley has appointed Simon Hunt as his assistant and Malcolm Webster as the goalkeeping coach. The departures of long-standing staff such as Rofe and Coles has come as a shock to the players. Although Burley has made two swift appointments, Woodward's increased power is demonstrated in the overhaul of a regime that showed resistance to some of his innovations, notably the appointment of Simon Clifford. Woodward confirmed he played a significant part in the recruitment of Burley. \"The key with the various changes that have happened and people leaving was to find a coach that I really wanted to work with and I've spent a lot of time meeting a lot of people over the last two weeks,\" said Woodward. \"I'm director of football, I'm heading up the football side. I wouldn't say I'm the boss. I don't see it as being accountable, we are just going to work together. I think we can really do something very special. George is the main man, he is in charge of the first team. He picks the team.\" Woodward, who believes he is up to three years away from managing in his own right, has been the technical and performance director during his five months at St Mary's. \"A title is a title, it's totally irrelevant,\" he said, \"my main role is focused on the training ground and environment down there. I look at the individual player, how to make him special.\" Attention will inevitably focus on the relationship between Woodward and Burley, who left previous jobs at Derby and Hearts following rumours of interference from above. \"Everything around the first team revolves around me,\" said Burley, who has a 2\u00bd-year contract. \"My job hasn't changed. As far as coaching, working with players and bringing players in and out, nothing has changed at all.\" Burley believes Southampton, who are 12th in the Championship, could reach the play-offs this season, adding that he wanted to taste Premiership and European football again, as he did with Ipswich. Of Woodward's footballing credentials, he said: \"Jose Mourinho was Sir Bobby Robson's interpreter and he didn't do bad. He [Woodward] has already shown at a different sport he is world class. It is important that you are not just blinkered to one sport and it's good to look at other ideas.\" The Southampton midfielder Dennis Wise was also in the running for the head coach job. \"I would like him to stay on,\" said Burley, \"he is a very good player and a tremendous character.\" For Rupert Lowe, the chairman, yesterday saw the realisation of a vision for the organisation of the club. \"George's strength and enjoyment is structuring the team and coaching the team. That's what we haven't had enough over the last couple of years,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
