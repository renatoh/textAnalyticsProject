Lancashire's wicketkeeper-captain was tipped in some quarters to get the gloves after James Foster was ruled out with a broken arm but Alec Stewart was given the nod . \"They didn't even have the decency to ring and tell me,\" said Hegg. \"I thought I was in with a shout. After all, they took me all over the world with them in the winter and, even though I ended up being a glorified drinks waiter, I worked hard. \"I've had a fairly good start to this season, no one had told me that I would not be considered, so I was bound to believe I had a chance. I left my phone on all night, thinking I would get a call either way, but there was nothing. \"No arguments with them choosing Alec Stewart. He is a world-class player. But I was left dangling. I obviously don't fit in with the current management's plans. Never mind, I have a massive job to do with Lancashire and I can put all my effort into that,\" he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
