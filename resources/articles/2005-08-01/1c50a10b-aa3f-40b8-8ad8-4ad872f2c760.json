Chelsea had been further frustrated on Monday in the summer's most drawn-out transfer as the documents dealing with its financial formalities were not returned, though they had been faxed to his club Lyon. But it emerged yesterday that the delay was no more suspicious than that August 15 is a public holiday in France and Lyon had given their entire staff the day off. \u00b7 Milan Baros has spoken with his former Anfield team-mate and fellow countryman Patrik Berger and the pair are set to team up again at Aston Villa. The Czech striker, preparing for tonight's friendly against Sweden, said: \"He said it is a club of very high quality, but he did not give me any advice. He left the decision to me.\" The striker also denied claims that talks with the midlands club stalled over his wage demands, revealing that Villa were willing to pay him even more than he asked for. \u00b7 Villa's goalkeeper Stefan Postma has joined Wolves for training, with a view to a possible move. The Dutchman was due to feature for their reserves against Newcastle last night. Wolves are short of cover for their first-choice keeper Michael Oakes as Paul Jones is broke a cheekbone in a pre-season friendly against Dundee and Matt Murray has yet to recover from surgery on his broken foot. \u00b7 Bolton's manager Sam Allardyce has admitted that signing Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata is a gamble - but it is one he is willing to take. Nakata has joined on a 12-month loan from Fiorentina, having played in Italy for seven years. \"It's a risk signing. But he has been in Europe for a long time now, so he should be able to adjust,\" said Allardyce. \u00b7 Mark Fish, 31, has retired because of a chronic knee injury. The former South Africa international defender, who was given a free transfer by Charlton at the end of last season, had signed a one-month loan deal with Ipswich but only played 45 minutes for them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
