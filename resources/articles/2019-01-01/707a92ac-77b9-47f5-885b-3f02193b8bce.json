Mourinho stripped the midfielder of the vice-captaincy and told him he would never be captain but Solskj\u00e6r has worked with Pogba in the past and regards him as a leader. \u201cHe\u2019s a character, he influences people, he cares and he really wants to be successful,\u201d United\u2019s caretaker manager said. \u201cI know him from before [Pogba\u2019s first spell at the club when Solskj\u00e6r was on the coaching staff] and when he\u2019s enjoying himself he brings so many good things with him. \u201cHe knows he can\u2019t do it by himself, he knows it\u2019s a team game but you can see the personality, you can see what winning the World Cup meant to him, so for me, yes, he\u2019s captain material.\u201d Pogba\u2019s social media profile has proved a problem but Solskj\u00e6r is comfortable with modern trends, even if he does not always understand them. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the era we live in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s society now, it\u2019s what kids do and what they are used to. I\u2019m not but they are. It\u2019s all positive, it\u2019s all good messages and I don\u2019t have any problem with it, because that\u2019s Paul and that\u2019s Jesse [Lingard]. As a club we have certain rules but mostly it\u2019s just common sense.\u201d Antonio Valencia remains the club captain, though currently a non-playing one, with Ashley Young taking charge in his absence. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some iconic captains here, all sorts of different types from Eric Cantona to Roy Keane,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThe important thing is not to be afraid of standing in front of your teammates and putting them in their place if you have to. To be fair to Ash, he\u2019s quite good at that. He\u2019s maybe one of the last of the old-school ones, he sounds like Rio Ferdinand or Gary Neville.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
