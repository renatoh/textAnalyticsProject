I love it. Having heard some bloke try to justify his creepy women-on-tube-eating-food facebook page this morning on BBC Radio Four's premier news programme, I confidently expect to hear how this \"lonely chair\" business is proper art tomorrow on all major outlets. So I thought the Guardian should get in. It's art. And the furniture doesn't mind. (Because it's furniture, lads. That's the difference.) More pictures seem to be appearing on the #lonelychairsatcern hashtag. And here. Jon Butterworth\u2019s book, Smashing Physics, is out on 22 May. You can order it now!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
