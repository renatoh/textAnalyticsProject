Demonstrations at the company\u2019s offices around the world began at 11.10am in Tokyo and took place at the same time in other time zones. They follow allegations of sexual misconduct made against senior executives, which organisers say are the most high-profile examples of \u201cthousands\u201d of similar cases across the company. An image from the Singapore hub showed at least 100 staff protesting. Greater numbers appeared on the streets outside Google\u2019s Swiss office in Zurich, and there were protests in the Israeli city of Haifa and Berlin. Google staff also walked out of the London, Dublin and New York offices. In London, the majority of employees left their desks and occupied the main auditorium in the company\u2019s King\u2019s Cross office. Once the room was filled, some gathered outside, as did a separate contingent of employees from the company\u2019s AI subsidiary, DeepMind, prompting some confusion from those who did not recognise their corporate siblings. \u201cI\u2019m here protesting against harassment in the workplace, to make sure we don\u2019t protect or support those perpetrators of harassment,\u201d one demonstrator told Sky News. \u201cPeople are supporting those who have been harassed in any workplace situation, by any employer, and this is just part of the movement.\u201d Employees were urged to leave a flyer at their desk that read: \u201cI\u2019m not at my desk because I\u2019m walking out in solidarity with other Googlers and contractors to protest [against] sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency and a workplace culture that\u2019s not working for everyone.\u201d The Walkout for Real Change protest comes a week after it emerged that Google gave a $90m (\u00a370m) severance package to Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile phone software, but concealed details of a sexual misconduct allegations that triggered his departure. Rubin has denied the allegations. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, insisted that the company had taken a \u201chard line\u201d over sexual misconduct and would support employees who took part in the protests. \u201cEmployees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward. We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action,\u201d he said. Campaigners have posted a list of five demands, including an end to pay and opportunity inequality as well as greater transparency about sexual harassment. The New York Times, which broke the Rubin story, also reported allegations of sexual misconduct against a number of other Google executives. These included Richard DeVaul, a director at the Google-affiliated lab that created far-flung projects such as self-driving cars and internet-beaming balloons. DeVaul had remained at the X lab after allegations surfaced about him a few years ago. He resigned on Tuesday without a severance package. Pichai apologised for the company\u2019s \u201cpast actions\u201d in an email sent to employees this week. \u201cI understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,\u201d it said. \u201cI feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society and, yes, here at Google, too.\u201d The email did not mention the reported incidents involving Rubin, DeVaul or anyone else but Pichai did not dispute the veracity of the New York Times story. Thursday\u2019s protest will be a test of how effectively Pichai has managed to placate staff anger over the issue. Google and its parent company, Alphabet, employ 94,000 people worldwide. An estimated 400 to 500 Googlers walked out of the New York office in Manhattan, gathering in a small park a few blocks away. Organisers said later that approximately 3,000 New York staff had taken part in the walkout. Some carrying signs with slogans such as \u201cWorkers rights are women\u2019s rights\u201d and \u201cTime\u2019s Up tech\u201d \u2013 the latter a reference to the Time\u2019s Up workers\u2019 equality campaign stemming from last year\u2019s reboot of the #MeToo movement in the US. The mostly young workers listened to some of their co-workers address the crowd, such as Demma Rodriguez, who heads equity engineering at Google in New York. \u201cEnough is enough is enough!\u201d she shouted, to cheers. \u201cEvery single person at Google is exceptional \u2026 it is absolutely disgusting that anyone thinks you can be less than exceptional, worse than that, you can be negligent about sexual assault, sexual harassment and abuse of power.\u201d One man protesting, who declined to give his name, said he participated in the walkout because \u201cI have a sister, a mother.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m here for all the women in my life.\u201d Many were too nervous to talk to reporters, while some said they had been told by bosses not to or to refer the media to the company\u2019s PR department. But Amelia Brunner, 25, a software engineer, who has been with the company for three years, said that while she hasn\u2019t experienced sexual harassment, she has endured different treatment at work because of her gender. \u201cPeople will doubt my work a lot more than they will doubt my male colleagues,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will get talked down more in meetings.\u201d She said that while she has a \u201cloud personality\u201d that helps her overcome this, others may not. \u201cTheres a trickle-down effect \u201c she said. \u201cHow are you supposed to rise in the ranks?\u201d Mike Clancy, the general secretary of Prospect, the UK union for technology workers, backed the protest. He said: \u201cThe events at Google highlight the frustration many workers feel about their lack of voice in how many tech companies are run. We need a zero tolerance for harassment and greater transparency over terms and conditions for staff.\u201d Jackie Speier, a Silicon Valley congresswoman, tweeted her support of the walkout using the #MeToo hashtag, which has become a battle cry for women fighting sexual misconduct. Speier represents an affluent district where many Google employees live, the Associated Press reported. In San Francisco, where approximately 2,500 employees work, hundreds gathered in front of the city\u2019s Ferry Building. Demonstrators booed as stories of bad executive behavior were told over the megaphone, and cries went up of: \u201cWe\u2019re fed up, we can\u2019t take it, equal pay, right now.\u201d One Latina employee said she was proud of how the event was able to mobilize a lot of workers in such a short time. Standing next to a white male colleague, the woman, who declined to give her name, said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just women who came together. It was everyone coming together for the cause.\u201d Just before lunchtime on the west coast, the wave of global protests reached Google\u2019s sprawling corporate headquarters in the San Francisco suburb of Mountain View. Speakers in a central courtyard flanked by glass-walled office buildings were ringed by several hundred people who packed concrete walkways, waded into flower beds and stood atop benches or low walls. Around a central folding table, participants wrote signs with slogans like \u201cTime\u2019s Up for tech\u201d, \u201cHappy to quit for $90 million\u201d and \u201cHey Google, do better\u201d. The crowd, heavy on jeans and Google-branded apparel, alternately cheered and booed as organizers read stories submitted by female employees, many anonymously. They alleged widespread sexual harassment, a pervasive gender gap in pay and at least one suspected attempted assault. Individual speakers recounted sexual comments from superiors, and months- or years-long ordeals with human resources officials who often urged silence. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m leading young girls and boys to the slaughter,\u201d said one speaker, who identified herself as an employee who works on Android applications for children. \u201cI mean, why would you want to go into tech if it\u2019s like this?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
