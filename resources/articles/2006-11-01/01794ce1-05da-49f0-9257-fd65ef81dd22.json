This is similar to advice that Katherine Rake, director of the Fawcett Society which campaigns for equality between men and women, was once given: \"A teacher told me to learn to type, but never let anyone know that you can.\" So why the fuss? Both tips were designed to stop women being pushed into typically female roles, something that regularly happens in the workplace. \"Anecdotal evidence shows it's still very common when it comes to things to do with nurturing, caring and admin to ask a woman rather than to ask a man,\" says Rebecca Gill, policy officer for women's equality at the TUC. Rake agrees: \"Stereotypes about appropriate behaviour for women and men are very strong in people's minds and this kind of thing happens all the time. One of the problems is that you often only realise this after the event when you stop and think 'why was it me who was asked?'\" This regularly happens to Nicole, 26, who works for a charity, and who finds that when the PA and team administrator - both women - are away, she is the first person her boss turns to for help with administrative duties. \"Once, when my boss couldn't get hold of his PA and needed his diary checking, he called me on my mobile rather than one of the more junior men at the office. I definitely felt that it was because I'm a woman.\" Nicole hasn't said anything because she is concerned about causing a fuss. But Esther, a 28-year-old editor who was recently asked to stand in for the secretary at a meeting, decided to make herself clear: \"The secretary was away and we needed someone to take the minutes. They immediately asked me. I felt that it was because I was the only young woman there it was assumed that I would take on the secretarial role.\" When Esther declined, it led to trouble with her manager: \"I was put on the spot and ended up looking stroppy, and my manager felt that I made her look stupid.\" So if you feel you are being assigned a role just because you are a young woman, how can you refuse it without ruffling too many feathers? The situation Covering for secretarial and reception staff Ellen, 32, works in public relations. \"When the people in the front office are away, I'm always asked to cover the reception never one of my male colleagues.\" Because most secretarial and receptionist roles are filled by women, people assume it is women who will stand in when needed. How to refuse \"This is a workload issue,\" says Rebecca Gill. \"The individual has to decide whether it's appropriate there and then to say no, or whether to do it and bring up the issue later.\" \"Try using humour or cheekiness to draw attention to the issue,\" suggests Angela Baron, an adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. Angela Mansi, senior lecturer in occupational psychology at Westminster Business School agrees: \"Cheekiness gets you out of some tight corners, so try saying lightly 'Are you asking me because I'm a woman?'\" The situation Pouring the tea \"When I'm in a meeting I make a point of never pouring the tea,\" says Sarah, 28, a project manager. It might be difficult when you're all sitting there thirsty - but by pouring the tea you are reinforcing the idea that this is women's work. How to refuse Ronnie Fox is an employment specialist at the City law firm Fox. \"'It's not my job to do that' is a phrase I have outlawed in the office,\" he says. \"If someone is asked to pour the tea because they are nearest the teapot, then they should pour the tea. But organisations that gender stereotype create unhappy employees, and then they lose out commercially because people don't want to work in that kind of environment. Of course, it's OK to say no to things - and if you think things are unfair you should go to your boss and say so.\" \"It's up to women not to offer,\" says Gill. \"Make yourself tea before the start of a meeting and take it in with you, so who pours the tea isn't your problem. The situation Organising the Christmas party \"It always falls to me to organise the office Christmas party, and birthday cards too,\" says Hilary, who works for a local authority. \"If I didn't do it, then I don't think anyone else would bother.\" How to refuse \"Organising parties and cards for special events is part of falling into the caring role,\" says Rake. \"It can be what makes the workplace a pleasant place to be, but women have to be careful not to fall into a caring role.\" Mansi agrees that women need to resist doing what she calls the \"soft\" tasks. \"If you're the managing director you can do this, but if this becomes a role assigned to you then you can lose credibility.\" Mansi suggests saying yes, but only as part of a team effort. \"You might say 'I'm happy to do this but it would be nice to have help on this. What about you John?' and name someone specific.\" She suggests being assertive, calm and confident and ensuring you give a reasonable response such as \"I'm happy to help out as part of a team but it's not my job.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
