Leonard Orban, the EU commissioner for multilingualism, says that small- to medium-sized companies in the UK are increasingly turning to foreign nationals to fill jobs that call for more than one language. His comments came as it emerged that the European Commission is facing such a severe shortage of native English-speaking interpreters that meetings are being cancelled. The commission also warns that it may have to cut the number of documents it translates because of the dwindling number of British students with degrees in French and German. Since 2002, member states have been committed to a policy of working towards all citizens speaking their mother tongue plus two other languages. A league table to be in place by 2010 will show the competence of students in different EU countries at the end of compulsory schooling. It is widely accepted that Britain will be near the bottom . 'British graduates are missing out on some of the best jobs at home and abroad because they are on the whole monolingual,' said Orban, a Romanian who speaks English, French and Italian. 'An English mother-tongue candidate with additional languages has an even more competitive edge, but let's not forget that only about 25 per cent of the world's population speaks English. If you know the local language and culture, you are more likely to clinch that lucrative business deal, so it is an economic problem for Britain as well,' he said. Likening himself to a doctor helping to cure Britain's poor language skills, Orban said research shows that employers see students with languages as more flexible and better able to build relationships with clients in other countries. 'It is important to promote language learning in the UK in order to give UK citizens the possibility of being more employable, because companies even in this country are hiring people of other nationalities who have better linguistic skills,' he said. Marco Benedetti, the EU's director-general for interpretation, says that a generation of staff who joined when the UK became part of the EU are about to retire and that young people are not coming out of universities to replace them. 'If we don't do something very soon, there will be more and more non-native English speakers obliged to interpret into English,' he said. The British government's decision to allow pupils to drop a modern foreign language at 14 has been blamed for the downturn in GCSE and A-level candidates. The numbers taking GCSEs began to decline in 2002, when Estelle Morris, the Education Secretary at the time, announced that languages would no longer be compulsory for 14 to 16-year-olds from 2004. Many schools pre-empted the policy and stopped entering weaker candidates before the deadline. The number of 16-year-olds taking GCSE French fell again this year, with 201,940 UK entries compared with 347,007 in 2001. Only 76,695 students sat GCSE German, down from 135,133. That trend is translating into a fall in the number studying languages at university. Only 610 students started degree courses in German last year, compared with 2,288 a decade ago, according to a study by the School of Oriental and African Studies. The number taking French fell by a third, from 5,655 to 3,700, over the same period. Modern foreign languages are increasingly seen as elitist, kept alive by the independent sector and selective grammar or specialist language colleges in the state sector, says Fiona Harris, the multilingual officer at the EU's offices in London. 'Already some meetings are being cancelled because they haven't got interpreters,' she says. 'It's not all doom and gloom because we are seeing an increased take-up of Mandarin and Arabic, but that doesn't help us because we need people speaking English, French and German, the three procedural languages.' UK graduates who do have a command of French and German are not always suitable to work as interpreters because of their poor knowledge of English grammar and wide use of slang, says Brian Fox, the EU's director of interpretation. 'Many of the youngsters coming in now speak as if they were talking to their friends when they should be moving up a register. Their command of the English language isn't there any more,' he warns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
