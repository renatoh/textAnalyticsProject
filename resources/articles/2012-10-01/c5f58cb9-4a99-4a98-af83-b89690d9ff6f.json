Tomorrow the countdown continues: check this space for updates. \"I'm a son of Detroit, I was born in Detroit,\" Governor Romney said in Monday's debate. \"And I would do nothing to hurt the US auto industry. My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in trouble was not to start writing checks...\" The president told Romney he was \"airbrushing history,\" reminding him he had opposed the bailout in print. But the bailout was not necessarily against Romney's interests. The Republican nominee may even have made money on the deal. In an investigative report in the Nation, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy author Greg Palast traces how auto bailout money made its way to hedge fund investors who owned a parts manufacturer called Delphi. At least one of those investors, Paul Singer, managed at least $1 million from a blind trust belonging to Ann Romney. When the bailout worked for Delphi, Singer made money and the Romneys made money, Palast writes. If the Romneys did not know about their investment in Delphi, Palast writes, they should have figured it out: Nevertheless, even if the Romneys were blind to their initial investment in Elliott [Singer's hedge fund], they would have known by the beginning of 2010 that they had a massive position in Delphi and would make a fortune from the bailout and TARP funds. Delphi is not a minor investment for Singer; it is his main holding. To invest in Elliott is essentially a \u201cDelphi play\u201d: that is, investing with Singer means buying a piece of the auto bailout. Palast lays out the case in an interview with Democracy Now here. The Romney campaign replied to the report in The Hill: Romney's campaign did not deny that he profited from the auto bailout in an email to The Hill Wednesday afternoon, but it said the the report showed the Detroit intervention was \"misguided.\" \"The report states that Delphi had 29 US plants before the misguided Obama auto bailout, and just four after. Is this really what the president views as success,\" Romney spokeswoman Michele Davis said. \"Mitt Romney would have taken a different path to turning around the auto industry,\" Davis continued. \"As President, Mitt Romney will create jobs and give American workers the recovery they deserve.\" The Guardian's Adam Gabbatt calls Donald Trump's office to ask for his college records and passport records. It goes over like candy. The Karl Rove group American Crossroads has put out a new ad narrated by Clint Eastwood. The ad is called \"At Stake.\" \"When someone doesn't get the job done, you've got to hold them accountable,\" says Eastwood, who appears at the end of the ad. \"Obama's second term would be a rerun of the first and our country just couldn't survive that. We need someone who can turn it around fast and that man is Mitt Romney.\" Is it just us or are Rove's attack ads this year not all that nasty? This one is pretty gentle. The polling news \u2013 noise, Harry Enten calls it \u2013 seems pretty good today for Obama. Shelley Berkley is the Democratic candidate for Senate. A new Time magazine poll puts the president ahead of Governor Romney 49-44 in the key swing state of Ohio. Time reports that the race is neck-and-neck among people who plan to vote on Election Day but the president has opened a wide lead among early voters, giving him the edge: The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus three percentage points. [...] The poll makes clear that there are really two races underway in Ohio. On one hand, the two candidates are locked in a dead heat among Ohioans who have not yet voted but who say they intend to, with 45% of respondents supporting the President and 45% preferring his Republican challenger. But Obama has clearly received a boost from Ohio\u2019s early voting period, which began on Oct. 2 and runs through November 5. Among respondents who say they have already voted, Obama holds a two-to-one lead over Romney, 60% to 30%. Read the rest here. Herein, The Republican Party Rape Advisory Chart. Wow, they finally caught that monkey in St. Petersburg, Florida, CBS reports: \"We concealed ourselves in the area,\" said Baryl Martin, spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, \"and we waited for the monkey to approach.\" Then the monkey was shot with a tranquilizer dart. [...] The Rhesus Macaque achieved notoriety in the Tampa Bay area after repeatedly managing to elude wildlife officials since 2009. The chase, which spanned at least three counties, has been chronicled by local and national media. The president picks up Maya Angelou's vote of confidence, our Gary Younge reports: Paul Ryan delivered a speech today on upward mobility and the economy at Cleveland State University. The video is at C-SPAN. The speech was billed as Ryan's \"first major policy address since becoming the Republican Vice Presidential nominee.\" \"Right now, America's engines of upward mobility aren't working the way they should,\" Ryan said. He said African-American and Hispanic children are disproportionately stuck in substandard schools. \"The question before us today... is how do we get the engines of upward mobility turned back on?\" His answer is to end what he calls a \"culture of dependency.\" He said the fact that the number of people on welfare decreased under President Bill Clinton's welfare reform law demonstrates the power of empowerment. He doesn't say what happened to those people who lost benefits. Ryan said government has the responsibility to protect society's most vulnerable. His budget plan, of course, does the opposite, chopping Medicaid by double digits and ending a swath of programs low-income families depend on. He says Governor Romney \"has always given his time and attention to those around him who are hurting.\" This is by all reports the truth. Elections hinge on... voting. President Obama has 131 campaign field offices in Ohio to Romney's 40. Democrats have registered half a million more voters in Florida than Republicans. Interested in how the ground game is playing out? The Atlantic's Molly Ball has reported the story out. About those offices: But the difference isn't just quantitative, it's qualitative. I visited Obama and Romney field offices in three swing states -- Ohio, Colorado and Virginia -- dropping in unannounced at random times to see what I could see. There were some consistent, and telling, differences. [...] These basic characteristics were repeated in all the offices I visited: The Obama offices were devoted almost entirely to the president's reelection; the Republican offices were devoted almost entirely to local candidates, with little presence for Romney. Read the whole thing here. Reports from Romney's Reno event: Joe Biden reacts to a baby crying during a speech he's trying to give. Check out the video. (Dorsey Shaw/FuzzBeed) Mitt Romney is hosting an event at Reno Events Center in Reno. HuffPo's poll tracker has Nevada at 50-46 for Obama. Every campaign fights for control over media coverage. But campaigns depend on the media to get their messages out. A quid pro quo develops. Campaigns trade access for coverage. What's strange is when a campaign asks for coverage but wants the access part to be invisible. Case in point: asking for a newspaper endorsement based on an off-the-record conversation. President Obama agreed to speak with the Des Moines Register this week about the election and why the paper should endorse him. But then the White House made the conversation off the record. The story might have ended there, with the Register editors deciding to endorse without ever releasing the nature of their conversation with the president. But Register editor Rick Green wrote a blog post Tuesday evening about the strange stipulation: The conference call lasted nearly 30 minutes and was an incredibly informative exchange of questions, answers and an insightful glimpse into the president\u2019s vision for a second term. He made a genuine and passionate case for our endorsement and for reelection. [...] Unfortunately, what we discussed was off-the-record. It was a condition, we were told, set by the White House. [...] We requested that the White House be asked to reverse course so whatever the president shared with us could be reviewed by voters and our readers. No reason was given for the unusual condition of keeping it private. We relented and took the call. How could we not? It\u2019s the leader of the free world on line one. Green's post caught the attention of Register readers and other media outlets. Speculation cropped up that the president had said something the White House did not want to be released. Questions about the off-the-record condition threatened to eclipse whatever impact an endorsement might have. There was the uncomfortable fact that Governor Romney had conducted an extensive, hourlong interview with the paper that he allowed to be filmed. The White House then suddenly reversed course, conceding to the newpaper's request to release details of the conversation. The paper published the transcript of the conversation online today. The bombshell in the transcript? No bombshell. Obama said a couple things slightly differently than he has said them before. The Huffington Post highlighted this passage about the Latino vote: \"Since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt,\" Obama said on a call Tuesday with the Register's publisher and editor, which was originally meant to be off the record. \"Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community.\" The Register will make its endorsement Saturday night. In 2008 the Register endorsed Obama, writing, \"Obama has earned the Register's endorsement for the presidency because of his steadfastness in the face of uncertainty, his clear-eyed vision for a more just America and his potential for rallying the country to do great things.\" The daughter of former candidate Jon. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has added her voice to an earlier White House dismissal of e-mails notifying Washington officials that militant groups had claimed responsibility on social media sites for the Benghazi attack. \"Posting something on Facebook is not in and of itself evidence. I think it just underscores how fluid the reporting was at the time and continued for some time to be,\" Clinton said, in remarks quoted by Reuters. The report continues: Clinton, responding to a reporter's question about the emails, noted that a State Department investigation was under way. \"The independent accountability review board is already hard at work looking at everything, not cherry picking one story here or one document there, but looking at everything - which I highly recommend as the appropriate approach for something as complex as an attack like this,\" she said. \"We will find out what happened. We will take whatever measures are necessary to fix anything that needs to be fixed and we will bring those to justice who committed these murders.\" President Obama is back in the lead 48-47 in Gallup's poll of registered voters. Obama last held the lead among registered voters in Gallup's poll on Oct. 14. Governor Romney still leads among likely voters 50-47, according to Gallup. That gap is 2 points smaller than it was yesterday and 4 points smaller than last week. Gallup found the president's approval rating up 2 points to 53%. Ed Pilkington is in Bowling Green, Ohio, for a look at the president's famed ground game. He has a surprise celebrity encounter: Obama for America, the re-election operation masterminded in Chicago, is waging the most intensive ground operation in US electoral history in Ohio. It has blanketed the state with 125 field offices and is sending out an army of volunteers, backed by the latest digital technology, to hunt down the 3% of voters who have yet to make up their minds. [...] At a local level, the final stretch of the campaign is being buoyed up by celebrities of a slightly more modest hew. Volunteers in the college town of Bowling Green in northwest Ohio were treated to a visit by Crystal Bowersox, an American Idol finalist best known for her white dreadlocks and her penchant for appearing barefoot. She may not be in the same league as the Boss, but Bowersox was able to fire up the volunteers. \"You guys know what's at stake, otherwise you wouldn't be here,\" she said to a gathering of about 30 volunteers, mainly women, about to go out canvassing. \"Being a woman is not a pre-existing condition, and we reserve the right to choose. Taking away the right to contraception is a terrible threat to women trying to sustain themselves financially.\" Full report here. That Romney-Ryan rally in Colorado yesterday saw a big turnout: Today the candidates continue to barnstorm the swing states, with President Obama making a quick California trip to tape Leno. Politico's James Hohmann and Emily Schultheis have the rundown: OBAMA in IOWA, COLORADO, CALIFORNIA and NEVADA: The president starts his day with a 10:10 a.m. EDT rally in Davenport, Iowa, then heads to another rally in Denver at 2:55 p.m. MDT. He\u2019ll tape his appearance on Jay Leno in Burbank, Calif., at 6:30 p.m. PDT, then fly to Las Vegas for another rally at 9:10 p.m. PDT. He will sleep on Air Force One overnight for a flight to Florida. ROMNEY in COLORADO, NEVADA, IOWA and OHIO: He flies from Denver to Reno, where he has an 11:45 a.m. PDT rally in Reno, flies to Cedar Rapids for a 7 p.m. CDT event and ends the night in Cincinnati. BIDEN in OHIO: He holds an event at 12:45 p.m. EDT in Marion. RYAN in OHIO: He\u2019s delivering a speech on \u201cUpward Mobility and the Economy\u201d at Cleveland State University at 2:20 p.m. EDT. The Washington Post confirms that Mitt Romney will not withdraw his support from Richard Mourdock after the Indiana Senate candidate said conception resulting from rape was something God intended. \u201cGov. Romney disagrees with Richard Mourdock, and Mr. Mourdock\u2019s comments do not reflect Gov. Romney\u2019s views,\u201d Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said. \u201cWe disagree on the policy regarding exceptions for rape and incest but still support him.\u201d The Obama campaign put out a statement this morning. \u201cThis is a reminder that a Republican Congress working with a Republican president Mitt Romney would [feel] that women should not be able to make choices about their own health care,\u201d Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. David Corn has more details about Gloria Allred's appearance this morning in a Massachusetts court alongside the ex-wife of the founder of Staples. Governor Romney contributed sworn testimony in the couple's divorce case, TMZ reported. This morning Allred asked a judge to unseal records in the divorce case between the founder, Tom Stemberg, and his wife at the time, Maureen, now apparently Allred's client. The records would include Romney's testimony. Maureen Stemberg has been trying for years to get her story told, Corn reports: Four years ago, Dragon-Lion Media, a movie production company based outside of Los Angeles, announced it was making a documentary on Maureen Sullivan Stemberg, with her cooperation. It issued a press release noting that this \"first-time tell all tale of the interweaving relationships and strange bedfellow[s]\" in her life would feature Romney, without specifying what role he would play. But Edmund Druilhet, the founder and CEO of Dragon-Lion Media, tells Mother Jones that Stemberg had discussed with him her belief that Romney had testified falsely to help Tom Stemberg during the trial. SWAK An aide to Donald Trump said in September that Trump planned to give \"millions\" to support Mitt Romney's candidacy. So far there's no indication that that has happened, although Trump did write a check for $100,000 to a Republican Super PAC. Today Trump released a video offering to give $5m to the charity of the president's choice if the president released his college records. Governor Mitt Romney will not pull his support from Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock, Dana Bash reports on CNN. The Romney campaign has denied requests to take down a television ad endorsing Mourdock, Bash quotes unnamed sources as telling her. UPDATE: Bash's report followed a televised press conference in which Mourdock sought to clarify his comments that a conception resulting from rape was as God intended. Mourdock said he abhors violence and sexual violence in all its forms. He said his words had been twisted in an attempt by his opponents to score political points. UPDATE 2: A second prominent Republican has broken ranks to condemn Mourdock. The Associated Press reports that Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) has cancelled a scheduled trip to Indiana Wednesday to campaign with Mourdock: Ayotte's spokesman, Jeff Grappone, said Wednesday that the senator disagrees with Mourdock's comments, which do not represent her views. Ayotte was scheduled to campaign with Mourdock on Wednesday, but canceled her trip and is in New Hampshire instead. E-mails sent two hours after the Benghazi attack notifying Washington officials that a militant Islamic group had taken responsibility for the attack did not constitute firm intelligence, the White House says. In response to questions from ABC News, which first reported the existence of the emails Tuesday night, the White House rejected the notion that the emails contradicted the Obama administration's public statements about the attacks. \u201cThere was a variety of information coming in,\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. \u201cThe whole point of an intelligence community and what they do is to assess strands of information and make judgments about what happened and who was responsible.\u201d Jake Tapper reports: One of the emails reported ...that Ansar al-Sharia claimed responsibility for the Benghazi attack on Facebook and Twitter, and had threatened to attack the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. [...] White House officials maintained that the emails don\u2019t contradict what the White House believed at that point, based on the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of the attack. The views of the intelligence community are valued far more than Facebook and twitter claims, officials said, describing that email as an unclassified ops alert email, not a vetted intelligence assessment. Three days after the Sept. 11 attack, Carney had a back-and-forth with Tapper in which he said \"We have no information to suggest that it was a preplanned attack\": MR. CARNEY: Jake, let\u2019s be clear, these protests were in reaction to a video that had spread to the region -- Q At Benghazi? What happened at Benghazi -- MR. CARNEY: We certainly don't know. We don't know otherwise. We have no information to suggest that it was a preplanned attack. The unrest we\u2019ve seen around the region has been in reaction to a video that Muslims, many Muslims find offensive. And while the violence is reprehensible and unjustified, it is not a reaction to the 9/11 anniversary that we know of, or to U.S. policy. Just yesterday TMZ scooped the political press with an exclusive interview with a bayonet manufacturer taking umbrage at the president's remarks that the military used fewer bayonets now. Now TMZ has published a report possibly tied to Gloria Allred's big announcement today: Mitt Romney downplayed the value of the office supplies company Staples during the divorce trial of Staples founder Tom Stemberg, the report says. Romney submitted a deposition and testimony in the trial, TMZ says. Here's the TMZ report. This morning David Bernstein tweeted a picture of Allred and client arriving in Canton, Massachusetts. Pressure is growing on Governor Mitt Romney weigh in on comments about rape made last night by a Senate candidate Romney has endorsed. \u201cAnd even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen,\u201d Indiana Treasurer Richard Mourdock said Tuesday during a Senate race debate. Mourdock is the only Senate candidate in this election cycle to benefit from an ad made by Romney, the Democratic National Committee points out. The DNC has produced an ad of its own splicing together Romney's endorsement of Mourdock with Mourdock's comments on rape and God: Today Mourdock sought to clarify his comments. He released a statement: God creates life, and that was my point. God does not want rape, and by no means was I suggesting that he does. Rape is a horrible thing, and for anyone to twist my words otherwise is absurd and sick. Mourdock, of course, isn't the only Republican Senate candidate who has sought to retract something he said about rape this election season. After announcing that the female body has a mechanism that can shut down conception in the case of \"legitimate rape,\" Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin produced an apology video: After initially banning Akin for comments they called unacceptable, the Republican party quietly resumed cash support for his candidacy when it became clear they could not scare him from the race. Indiana gubernatorial candidate Mike Pence, a former chairman of the House Republican Conference, has broken ranks with his party to condemn Mourdock's rape comments. \"I strongly disagree with the statement made by Richard Mourdock during last night's Senate debate. I urge him to apologize,\" Pence said. Here's what Romney said about Akin: Congressman's Akin comments on rape are insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong. Like millions of other Americans, we found them to be offensive. Good morning and welcome to our Wednesday live blog politics coverage. It's October surprise day, an announcement that might seem to want an exclamation point, but does not. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Literally certified bushwa artist and media puppet master Donald Trump of New York, New York, has telegraphed a punch against the president to land at noon ET. Meanwhile California lawyer Gloria Allred, who knows a thing or two about TV cameras herself, is rumored to be teeing up material damaging to Governor Romney. There are 13 days to go in the race to the White House. \u2022 A CBS/Quinnipiac poll released today \"found that, riding a wave of strong support among women, President Barack Obama holds a 50 - 45 percent lead\" in Ohio. Conservative commentators point out that the poll was conducted October 22, two days ago. \u2022 Reuters reports that White House and State Department officials were advised two hours after the attack on the US mission in Benghazi that an Islamic militant group had claimed credit, emails show. We'll take a closer look at the timeline of the attack and the official response today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
