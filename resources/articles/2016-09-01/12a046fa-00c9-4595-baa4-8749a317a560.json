Judge Sergio Moro \u2013 who has overseen the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation into bribery and kickbacks at Petrobras and other major corporations \u2013 must now assess allegations that the Workers\u2019 party figurehead accepted 3.7m reais ($1.1m) in bribes. Lula denies the accusations, which he claims are an attempt to prevent him from running in the next presidential election in 2018. The decision to go ahead with the trial \u2013 which will take place in the city of Curitiba \u2013 comes amid a period of intense political and economic turmoil, which has been exacerbated by the two-year Lava Jato investigation and a conspiracy to end 13 years of Workers\u2019 party rule. Last month, Lula\u2019s successor president Dilma Rousseff was impeached and ejected from office less than halfway through her mandate on relatively minor charges of window-dressing state accounts ahead of the 2014 election. Last week, Brazil\u2019s congress expelled the politician who orchestrated that campaign, former speaker Eduardo Cunha, who is accused of accepting millions in bribes and stashing them in secret Swiss bank accounts. New president Michel Temer has also been implicated in the scandal, three of his ministers have been forced to resign, and other senior figures in his ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement party (PMDB) are expected to come under more pressure in the weeks ahead. Brazil\u2019s major cities have witnessed sporadic, large and sometimes violent street protests for much of the past year, most recently focussed on a Fora Temer (Temer Out) campaign. The president is booed whenever he appears in public and has also divided the region. When he spoke at the United Nations on Tuesday, delegates from Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Costa Rica walked out in a sign that they refuse to recognise his legitimacy. The trial of Lula could raise temperatures further. The former union leader has dominated the political landscape since he led the Workers\u2019 party to its first presidential victory in 2002. Prosecutors allege that he kept his party \u2013 and its allies, including Temer\u2019s PMDB \u2013 in power with funds illegally obtained from over-inflated contracts from government-run companies, such as Petrobras. Last week, public prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol, said Lula was the \u201ckingpin\u201d in the Petrobras scheme, which caused an estimated 42bn reais ($12.6bn) in losses. \u201cHe was the conductor of this criminal orchestra,\u201d Dallagnol said. \u201cThe Petrobras graft scheme aimed at keeping the Workers\u2019 party in power by criminal means.\u201d Prosecutors also allege that Lula benefited through refurbishments carried out by construction companies at two properties. This is denied by the former president and his lawyers, who say he does not own the properties in question and has not even visited one of them. Workers\u2019 party supporters claim the Lava Jato investigation is politically biased and that most of those accused in other parties will not be held to justice. Underlining their fears, congressmen last night attempted to push through legislation that would grant sitting lawmakers amnesty. The implications go far beyond the trial itself. Ana Claudia Farranha, a law professor at the University of Brasilia, said the legal case \u2013 although contentious \u2013 will distract Da Silva and complicate the next presidential election in which he is the frontrunner. Ultimately, she said, it could lead to a realignment of political parties. \u201cThe fence is closing around Lula,\u201d said Farranha. \u201cAs the investigations progress, Lula weakens. I think we will see big surprises for 2018 \u2026 I don\u2019t think the PT (Workers Party) will disappear, but there will be a redefinition of party blocs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
