The most popular causes among those who did make donations were medical research and children or young people, which received 15% of the total amount given to charity. But the amount received by charitable organisations during 2000 totalled \u00a35.76bn, a return in real terms to 1993 levels following a sharp decline in the mid-1990s, the survey revealed. This is down to donors giving more as the percentage of the population donating to charity has only crept up from 64.1% in 1997 to 67.5% last year. Back in 1994, eight out of 10 Britons donated money to good causes. The study conducted by NOP involved interviewing 1,000 people each quarter and revealed the average monthly donation across the population was \u00a310.35, up from last year's figure of \u00a39.76. People aged between 25 and 64 were more likely to be donors and their average donation was higher compared with the youngest (16 to 24-year-olds) and the oldest the over-65s. Stuart Etherington, the NCVO's chief executive said: \"It is very encouraging to see such a recovery in the total amount donated to charity. \"Voluntary organisations are the glue that holds society together, we must work harder to encourage a return to the very high levels of public participation in charitable giving which Britain enjoyed in the early 1990s.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
