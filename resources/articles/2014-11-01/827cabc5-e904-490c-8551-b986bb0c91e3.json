For those of us who live in reality, balancing the demands of family, friends, Black Friday deals that end in stampedes \u2013 or the opposite, utter loneliness \u2013 is a lot more difficult. To get you through these trying times there is television, that glowing box in your living room that is always your friend and even contains your six best Friends. The networks aren\u2019t much help this Thursday. While CBS will offer its regular blockbuster Thursday night comedies (like Big Bang Theory), NBC is showing football, ABC is showing reruns, and Fox has some special about dogs. But have no fear, cable has you covered with plenty of marathons of your favorite old shows (or favorite current shows). It\u2019s like sharing a turkey with someone you love \u2013 even if they are fictional characters. Best Friends (Thursday 27 November at 10am EST, on TBS) No modern sitcom has embraced America\u2019s signature holiday like the dearly departed Friends. For the third year in a row, TBS is going to play all 10 of the show\u2019s holiday episodes in order, including the one with Brad Pitt. Yes, we can all remember happier times when everyone in the family got along. The Simpsons (Thursday 27 November at 4pm EST, on FXX) While this isn\u2019t nearly the epic every Simpsons episode ever the channel did in August, this will bring you 12 of this show\u2019s best episodes followed by the not-so-classic Simpsons movie. Even so, going to Springfield is way better than going back to your hometown anyway. Portlandia (Thursday 27 November at 9am EST, on IFC) The owners of Women and Women First would probably hate the colonial trappings of Thanksgiving but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to be as politically correct. Get ready for season five in January with these 11 episodes. You should probably put a bird on it anyway. Adventure Time (Thursday 27 November at 9am EST, on Cartoon Network) Not only is there a new episode of this delightfully trippy cartoon on every night this week at 7pm EST, we get 10 episodes in a row on Thursday morning just when the kids need something to distract them while the adults try to drink too much wine while cooking turkey. Thanks, Finn and Jake! Star Trek: the Next Generation (Friday 28 November at noon EST, on BBC America) The furthest you can possibly get from the boobs waiting to try to score a cheap plasma TV is to be on the other side of the universe \u2013 or at least on your couch taking in the sci-fi brilliance of this gem. And if you need to find the Borg, they\u2019re in the parking lot at Target. Worst The Millionaire Matchmaker (Thursday 27 November at 3pm EST, on Bravo) If we wanted someone shrill to tell us that we\u2019re not good enough and behaving horribly, we\u2019d be spending the day with our family members, not Patti Stanger. Modern Family (Thursday 27 November at 10am EST, on USA) America has lousy taste. It gives this increasingly mediocre sitcom an Emmy every year, and yet USA still lets viewers pick which episodes will air over this 14-hour block. They probably picked all the ones featuring Manny. Ugh, Manny. Swamp People (Thursday 27 November at 7am EST, on History Channel) It\u2019s not nice to laugh at your relatives, even if they are letting themselves be exploited for reality TV where they go hunting gators and sucking down crawdads. Cops (Thursday 27 November at 5pm EST, on Spike) I\u2019m not mad at Cops necessarily, but this is taking the place of Spike\u2019s classic James Bond marathon where they would show all of 007\u2019s best movies. That\u2019s one tradition I\u2019m certainly going to miss."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
