Kevin would argue Manchester City had enough chances as it was, with only Tim Howard stopping them, but I think with another striker they could have had more pressure and more opportunities. At 1-0 they might have forced a goal and then who knows what might have happened? The way it was, they were always playing catch-up. When Neville was sent off, all of a sudden there was an opening for City in a game they had been completely out of. I would have taken off Joey Barton and brought on Jon Macken, who got the winning goal at Tottenham in their last Cup match. But Kevin never threw on a single substitute. A big thing recently with Manchester United is that they've had problems with the aerial stuff and it was the same on Saturday. Antoine Sibierski got in on two or three occasions and City could have created more of those opportunities - and better ones - if they'd had an extra body in the box. A lot of City's best chances came when Richard Dunne had the ball high up the right-hand side of the field and sent crosses over. Sibierski pulled into some decent positions but a lot of the time he was going in for fighting balls because one of the United centre-backs was with him. Mik\u00e4el Silvestre was often free to keep an eye on Sibierski because he did not have a striker to mark. Fowler was the only one to worry about and John O'Shea was looking after him. If Macken had been in there disturbing Silvestre while the same move was developing it would have been easier for Sibierski to make those runs into empty space and there would have been more targets for Dunne to aim at. Macken could have gone towards Dunne and played a one-two, taking Silvestre with him. Or he could have made a run towards the near post, also forcing Silvestre to follow. Then Sibierski has a free run on to the cross, unless a midfielder has tracked him, because O'Shea has still got to look after Fowler. That is the value of an extra body moving defenders about. I do not think it was a coincidence that Sylvain Distin was up the field and creating problems in the box when City scored their first goal. He got his head on something and it went to Michael Tarnat. Full marks to Howard for making some terrific saves but City should have made life harder for him. They had a realistic chance of pulling it out of the fire but did not disturb United as much as they could have."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
