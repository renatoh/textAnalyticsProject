There were any number of theories doing the rounds as to why the prime minister couldn\u2019t be bothered to turn up for the Channel 4 leaders\u2019 debate on climate change. He was terrified it was a BBC set up and that Andrew Neil would sneak out from behind a curtain and shout \u2018Gotcha\u2019. He was just too shy to show how much he really cared about the environment. Just as he had been too shy to tell David Cameron that austerity was a bad idea back in 2010. He was exhausted after campaigning so hard to unleash the potential of women. Apart from hopeless unmarried mothers of course. They deserved everything they got. Along with the feckless dads who buggered off. There\u2019s going to be hell to pay when Boris Johnson finds out who fathered some of his children. Just to show how much he really, really wanted to be there, the prime minister sent along his dad and Michael Gove to the Channel 4 studios in his place. After all, Stanley was almost the same as him \u2013 give or take a few stray mutant genes \u2013 and the Govester had once expressed a vague interest in a polar bear. But Ben de Pear, Channel 4\u2019s news editor, had had to point out that, charming as both men probably were, neither was actually the leader of the Conservatives. And this was a leaders\u2019 debate. In a scene worthy of The Thick of It, Boris then had a temper tantrum at being excluded from a debate from which he had excluded himself and threatened to review Channel 4\u2019s public service broadcasting obligations. Satire had just eaten itself. The debate itself opened with a panoramic set of a world on fire and presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy explaining the Boris no-show and that he had been replaced with an ice sculpture of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The studio lights were turned on full and right on cue the ice sculpture started melting. There was an identical ice sculpture to represent the Brexit party, who also hadn\u2019t bothered to turn up, but no one was too interested in that one. Rather everyone was openly relieved that they didn\u2019t have to engage with Nigel Farage. After a short video featuring disappearing forests and glaciers, David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg and a dead koala, the five party leaders \u2013 the Green\u2019s Si\u00e2n Berry, Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price, the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon and the Lib Dems\u2019 Jo Swinson \u2013 were invited to indulge in some competitive virtue signalling with their opening statements. They all cared a lot a lot, though Swinson also cared about Brexit. Berry insisted she won first prize as she had cared much longer and the others were all arrivistes. She had a point. Corbyn couldn\u2019t believe his luck as he took the first question on climate change targets. Taking one look at the melting Boris, he indulged his obligatory free hit at the Tories. Something each of the leaders would also go on to do. Hell, why not? No one was going to contradict them. If there\u2019s one thing that everyone was agreed on \u2013 apart from the climate emergency being very serious \u2013 it was that the Tories were basically evil. The Conservatives target was 2050, Corbyn said. Which in reality was 2099. So Boris\u2019s secret plan was to kill the entire planet. He would get stuff done by 2030. Sturgeon and Swinson hurriedly tried to explain why their targets of 2045 really meant that they would be carbon neutral even sooner than Labour. Berry took the high ground and pronounced even 2030 to be defeatist and set her own target of 2029. This quickly developed into a free for all, before Sturgeon, the squabbler in chief, asked everyone to stop squabbling. Remembering they were all there to save the planet, all five leaders held hands and observed a minute\u2019s silence for the burnt koala. Thereafter all five leaders pretty much agreed with each other at every opportunity. People should start to eat a more plant-based diet and everyone should stop flying and take buses. Corbyn even promised to plant 2 billion trees by 2040. Or 200 a minute. There were going to be so many forests, no one would be able to see the wood for the trees. \u201cI\u2019ve got a copy of our green manifesto,\u201d said the Labour leader. \u201cI could have read that online,\u201d Guru-Murthy replied. Corbyn chastised himself and promised to make that two billion and one trees. The debate ended with everyone \u2013 even Jeremy who insisted he was already too miserable to turn the heating up \u2013 promising to do a lot better. The one exception was Berry who said she was fed up with lists and that we were probably going to die anyway. But even she was up for a group hug come the closing credits. After all there were no winners in a climate emergency. There were losers though. The two ice sculptures that had melted into a puddle on the studio floor.
