He expects me to go out and get one but he'll only pay for the (few) work-related calls. Am I the last person to survive without a mobile? How do I tell my boss I really don't want one, without appearing to be a luddite? Your boss should pay If you need a mobile phone for work purposes then your boss should supply one. Explain to your boss that if he/she wants to contact you outside work time then they can leave a message on your answer machine (if you have one), wait until the next day when you are in, or provide you with a mobile phone. The ball is firmly in their court. M Adams, Lancaster Check your contract Check your work contract about your employer's mobile phone policy. You may also wish to consult with your HR department or trade union, if you belong to one. If you need to make phone calls for work get your employer to give you a BT chargecard and a pager if they need to get hold of you urgently. Andrew Davidson, Middlesex You are a luddite Yes, you are the only person to survive without a mobile and no, you can't tell your boss you don't want one without appearing to be a luddite! By distancing yourself from the \"moron culture\" of mobile phone users, you are rather misguidedly claiming a moral high ground over the vast majority of human beings in this country. S Collins, London Emergency use only If you don't travel frequently travel further than 30 minutes away from work or home there is no need for you to get a mobile phone. But if you do so regularly you should get a mobile phone simply so family members can contact you, or you can make emergency calls - the number of telephone boxes on the streets has been decreasing. Getting a mobile phone doesn't mean you are accessible at all times of the day because you can switch it off. O Fadero, via email Culture is hard to avoid I was reluctant to get a mobile at first. However, it's no longer about the fact that you need one but that it is assumed that you have one. We live in a very last-minute culture where plans can rapidly change which can lead to problems if you can't be contacted. For this reason it is very hard to be the one remaining person who is out of the loop. I would compromise: get a pay as you go and ask your boss to pay for the handset and a certain amount of credit per month for work calls. This leaves you free to use the phone as much (or as little) as you want for personal calls and won't cost you much at all. Tess Riley, via email Don't give up Good for you. I respect anyone who does not use or want a mobile. The damn things have made our lives faster but not always easier. Certainly your boss should pay for one if he wants you to have one. And if you don't get one you won't get brain cancer which I'm sure will be prevalent in the next 10-20 years. James Blackwell, Guildford What's the point? We never had a mobile until a year ago when a well meaning friend donated one to us - or rather to our teenage son and daughter. Since then the mobile has spent most of its life in a drawer and during the few times that any of us remembers to cart it along, it is never used. Oops, I think it must need a recharge now... Mrs Helen Boden, London Get real Why don't you want to appear to be a luddite? You clearly are. You'll be much happier when you can admit it to yourself and others. Chris Wardhaugh, Melrose Look on the bright side Look at the advantages of having one: being able to call for help if your car breaks down (the built-in camera is also useful for insurance purposes if you have a prang), letting friends know that you're delayed, being able to meet up with people in busy environments such as festivals or stations. Consider buying a mobile but using it on your own terms: switch it on when you want, don't give your number out to everyone, choose whether you want to answer work calls or let the voicemail handle them and write your text messages in full sentences with correct punctuation. Paul Walmsley, London It's not necessary Don't give in to this misconceived request. Doing business is perfectly possible without a mobile. I am the director of a successful IT consultancy, in business for nine years, and I have never owned one. Suggest to your boss that they distract from the focus of work and are also the best way to disrupt meetings. Simon Woolf, London Spare a thought for your colleagues If you haven't got a mobile phone, your friends and relatives will have to call your workplace number. If you never, ever, receive personal calls at work, you would be rare indeed. A small business will not have a dedicated telephonist and must interrupt their other work to answer your personal call, a time-consuming task if you are not at your desk, and potentially causing business calls to be severely delayed or even lost. Claire Herniman, London My mobile phone epiphany I was a mobile phone luddite (as my family are fond of reminding me) until a bolt of lightning one Christmas Day destroyed our landline connection. We would have been completely unable to communicate with our daughter in the West Indies for the whole of Christmas had it not been for the free mobile that my student son had been given for signing up with a bank, and so I had to eat dirt. Get yourself a cheap pay as you go mobile (they're titchy little things these days), stick it in your bag and promise yourself it's only for emergencies. You'll soon break your promise.
