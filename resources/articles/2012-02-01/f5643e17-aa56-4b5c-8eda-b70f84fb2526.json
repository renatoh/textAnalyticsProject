It was a very good tackle, but like Stephen Ferris's on Ian Evans in the closing minutes of the Ireland-Wales thriller, it could well have seen him sin-binned. Rugby, a sport frequented by quite a few people who could keep a psychiatrist engaged for an hour or two, obviously needs its Geneva Convention, but if its referees are not allowed to make the same distinction on the field as the disciplinary officer in the review court then it may as well ban all contact. Bradley Davies, guilty of a genuinely heinous \u2013 and off-the-ball \u2013 tip-tackle was given seven weeks; Ferris received no supplementary punishment and Robshaw was neither penalised nor cited. Those within the game crave consistency. The wretched directives from Paddy O'Brien's refereeing bunker at the International Rugby Board attempted to make things black and white. The result is a mess, with common sense joining Davies and Ferris in the bin. One last directive from Paddy's outpost beyond reality should grant \u2013 or return to \u2013 the referees powers of interpretation. Anyway, that is all by the by. A sort of huff and puff to postpone the real issue: how to go from promoting Scotland one week as one pass away from being a force to picking up the detritus of their performance against England. Richie Gray and Ross Rennie were indeed one pass away from a try, but the delivery was gruesome. The Scots were denied a try for Greig Laidlaw after multiple inspections of the angles by the television match official, Nigel Whitehouse. To me it looked a try, but perhaps the TMO was influenced by too many hours spent watching \u2013 suffering \u2013 Scottish rugby, and had a notion fixed in his subconscious: you do not deserve it. Still, Scotland have been here before, in the grim place where the only choice is to shake themselves off and carry on. They play on Sunday in Cardiff against Wales who are acclaimed as a \"confidence team\", a side that grows and grows. They are certainly well fertilised, as it were \u2013 as fit now as they were for the World Cup, and buoyed by their away win in Dublin. Is it going to be so very horrible for Scotland, overrun by the side that can finish? The last time they came down to Cardiff for the second round was in 2010. They had lost at home to France 9-18 in the first round and it was expected to be, relatively speaking, a simple Welsh victory. Scotland knocked Wales all over the shop and a few minutes into the second half opened up a 21-9 lead. Wales had invited them into a game of runabout adventure and Scotland had agreed to go for it. They scored tries through John Barclay and Max Evans, both still around, and were dominating the game. Of course, they lost. They were reduced to 13 players \u2013 Scott Lawson and Phil Godman were binned \u2013 and Shane Williams scored with the last move of the game. It left Andy Robinson in that same old grim place, the twist being that instead of playing badly and losing, Scotland had played well and lost. The point is that when it comes to picking themselves up off the floor, Scotland are adept through plenty of practice. And in Cardiff the conditions are the same, the invitation to go wild held out once again to them. This is the fixture of light relief, guaranteed to be a party and all Scotland need to do is deliver the one pass that will finish off a move. Richie Gray is too good to fail again, isn't he? Ross Rennie had an otherwise superb game against England. One pass should not be beyond him. We have reached the point where it is obviously easier said than done, though for the life of Andy Robinson and all his attributes as a truly gifted coach he must be wondering how it can be so. You run, draw the final player and give the ball. Or bash and deliver, like gorgeous George North. What is the mystery? There clearly is one, and even on Thursday night in the Glasgow-Scarlets match there was evidence that the skill is beyond Scotland's grasp. Graeme Morrison was clear, having shouldered his way through the defence, and failed to make the final pass. It was a case of contact absorbing the thought processes more than the pass. Glasgow won the game, however, another reminder of the dangers of taking anything for granted. And it is in the nature of Wales to be generous with their secrets. They sometimes cannot help themselves. If they are intoxicated by the heady scents of home they may defy the message drummed into them by their coach, Warren Gatland, that you have to earn the right to go wide, and just go there anyway, loosely and laterally. And that would interest Scotland. It's a theory, and like anything to do with a Scottish revival, probably not to be taken too seriously."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
