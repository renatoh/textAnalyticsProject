Ferdy Murphy, the trainer, featured in an undercover BBC investigation into alleged malpractice in racing, at the cost of a \u00a34,000 fine and mountains of bad publicity. But 2002 was harder still for Timmy Murphy, who was jailed for a drink-fuelled assault on an air hostess and is now picking up the pieces of his riding career. But at the last, the year at least had the grace to grant them both a winner at the home of National Hunt racing, a glimpse perhaps of better times ahead. Ferdy was not there to greet Historg, who took the Racecourse of the Year Handicap Chase, but there was no mistaking the satisfaction on Timmy Murphy's face as he was led back on Vol Solitaire after the novice chase. And with good reason. Vol Solitaire was backed down to 10-11 to beat Golden Alpha, his only serious rival in the five-runner race, and did so with ease.It was a performance to merit a start, at least, in the Arkle Trophy at the Festival, and he is now a 14-1 chance for that race with Victor Chandler. What backers need to consider, though, is that Paul Nicholls, Vol Solitaire's trainer, has at least three more credible Arkle candidates in his yard, including Azertyuiop, the ante-post favourite. \"If you asked Ruby [Walsh] now which one he'll ride, he'd say Azerty without even hesitating,\" Nicholls said. \"They won't all run. \"Vol Solitaire is much better on this [soft] ground. He really wants 2 miles, but two miles is ideal on this ground in a strong-run race. If the ground was very testing for the Arkle, he'd probably take his chance - but there's other races.\" Nicholls had earlier seen Ad Hoc, whose long-term target is the Grand National, beaten at odds-on in the Spa Hurdle despite getting 8lb from the winner, Stromness, whose success came three years to the day since Alan King had last saddled a winner at Chel tenham. The trainer hopes that his wait for the next one will be less than 10 weeks since Stromness is now 16-1 from 33-1 for the Stayers' Hurdle. \"I was worried about the ground today, it's softer than he really wants, but his class got him through,\" King said. \"At least we've got something to bring back for the Festival.\" Those three days in March occupy every thought and plan, though Martin Pipe's Horus, who started favourite for the race won by Historg, did not show the form expected of a horse with a Gold Cup in him. He remains 40-1 with Hill's for chasing's finest prize. Live The Dream, another Pipe horse, should also be back in March, after her success in the Tote Exacta Handicap Hurdle. Live The Dream gave Tony McCoy his last winner of 2002 after he had been beaten on three consecutive favourites, falling off the odds-on Barryscourt Lad in the opening race. The most frustrated jockey, though, was Pat Eddery, who went to Wolverhampton for six rides on the all-weather in search of his 100th winner of the year - and with it his 28th century in 29 years - but ended stuck on 99. As of this morning, he's back on zero."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
