The president, Tim Wolfe, announced his resignation at a news conference Monday morning. He was followed several hours later by the university\u2019s chancellor and effective chief executive, R Bowen Loftin. \u201cI am resigning as president of the University of Missouri system today,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cI have thought and prayed about this decision. It\u2019s the right thing to do. The response to this announcement I\u2019m sure ranges from joy to some to anger for others. \u201cThe frustration and anger that I see is clear, it\u2019s real, and I don\u2019t doubt it for a second.\u201d Loftin announced on Monday that he would be stepping down from his position at the end of the year. He will remain at the school in a new role involving research. Faculty and deans of nine different departments had called for Loftin \u2013 a former president of Texas A&amp;M university who has held the position since February 2014 \u2013 to resign in a letter sent to the board of curators, according to the Columbia Daily Tribune. The pressure on Wolfe to resign increased at the weekend as the school\u2019s football team, with the support of its coaches, said it would not play until he stepped down. Hundreds of students joined a protest Sunday night over what they said was neglect \u2013 and even tolerance \u2013 by the school of flagrantly racist behavior. The protests began after the student government president, Payton Head, who is black, said in September that people in a passing pickup truck shouted racial slurs at him. In early October, members of a black student organization said slurs were hurled at them by an apparently drunken white student. And a swastika drawn in feces was found in a dormitory bathroom. The protests were organized by a student group, Concerned Students 1950, named for the year the university first admitted African American students. One graduate student, Jonathan Butler, staged a weeklong hunger strike. Wolfe admitted that the university had erred and asked that his resignation provide a moment for healing. \u201cThe question really is, why did we get to this very difficult situation? It is my belief that we stopped listening to each other. We didn\u2019t respond or react ... and we forced individuals like Jonathan Butler to take unusual actions, and immediate steps, to affect change. \u201cThis is not, I repeat not, the way change should come about.\u201d Wolfe, who spoke in a shaky voice and ended his statement in a struggle against tears, said: \u201cI take full responsibility for this frustration, and I take full responsibility for the inaction that has occurred.\u201d \u201cI ask everybody \u2026 use my resignation to heal, and start talking again, to make the changes necessary, and let\u2019s focus on changing what we can today, and in the future. \u201cMy decision to resign comes out of love, not hate.\u201d Wolfe offered an implicit criticism of the tone of the protests and their reception on the university side. \u201cWe have to respect each other enough to stop yelling at each other, and start listening,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to quit intimidating each other.\u201d Students celebrated the news of Wolfe\u2019s resignation with cheers. Within moments, student organizers were heard asking \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d And \u201cour work is just beginning.\u201d Butler, who ended a weeklong hunger strike on Monday, told CNN that the university still has a long way to go to make minority students feel welcome. He said the university system\u2019s governing board needs to listen to more minority faculty and student voices. Members of Concerned Students 1950 said Monday they want a say in choosing Wolfe\u2019s replacement and wanted to meet with the university\u2019s governing board and the state\u2019s governor. Missouri governor Jay Nixon called Wolfe\u2019s resignation \u201ca necessary step toward healing and reconciliation\u201d on the campus. Football coach Gary Pinkel said on Monday that the team\u2019s decision over the weekend arose out of concern for Butler. \u201cI got a call about Jonathan and the players were very very concerned with his life. I did the right thing and I would do it again,\u201d Pinkel said. \u201cI didn\u2019t look at consequences. I supported my players when they needed me.\u201d The school\u2019s athletic director, Mack Rhoades, also reiterated his department\u2019s support of the protests. He he had \u201cmixed emotions\u201d to the resignation of Wolfe, whom he called \u201ca caring man\u201d. \u201cOur student athletes decided to get involved and quite frankly we supported them. We do everything as an athletic department to make sure these athletes are leaders. And they were leaders.\u201d The University of Missouri system has about 35,000 students enrolled with an annual budget of about $2bn. The Division 1 Missouri Tigers football team plays before sold-out home stadium crowds of 76,000.
