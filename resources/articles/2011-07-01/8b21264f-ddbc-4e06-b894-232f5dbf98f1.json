Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, said the prospect of scholarships would motivate students to achieve the grades required for admission and demonstrate that pupils at every school have university potential. The awards would be for \u00a33,000 annually and Hughes has proposed that 10,000 should be made available. There are just over 1,800 state schools that offer A-levels and 298 colleges, including 91 sixth form colleges. He said: \"It would motivate youngsters at age 15 to realise that not only is university an option, but secondly that for some of you financial help is available.\" The government has announced plans for a national scholarship programme that will make annual awards of about \u00a33,000 to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are unlikely to go into higher education. The funding is due to be allocated through universities. In a report to government, Hughes calls for most of these scholarships to be distributed through schools. Students would be told about them at 15, and awards would be made on the basis of results when they were 16 or 17. Hughes compared the proposal to a scheme in Texas that guarantees admission to public universities for the highest achievers in every school. The MP said he hoped that an average of three scholarships could be made available in every state school and sixth form college. Schools that did not have students whose family income fell below a set threshold would have their scholarships allocated elsewhere. In his report, Hughes welcomes a commitment by the government to look at moving to a system of making university applications after pupils have their exam results. He said: \"A system of post-qualification admissions would allow the top universities to target better students who perform well and come from difficult backgrounds or from areas which do not usually send young people to university. This is already done by some of the top universities in the US. I understand that Harvard, for example, writes to every top performing minority student in the country asking them to consider applying.\" Hughes proposes beefing up the Office for Fair Access (Offa), the government watchdog on university access. It should be given powers to impose financial penalties if institutions fail to reach benchmarks on widening participation, he says. The current guidance says Offa should look at \"defined progress\" in relation to benchmarks. Thirteen of the 16 English Russell Group universities are below existing benchmarks for state school access. His report proposes that career discussions should begin in primary schools, with parents and family members invited in to talk to 10-year-olds about their jobs. The government should guarantee face to face careers advice for all young people in schools, he says. Hughes was appointed the government's advocate for access to education in December, shortly after abstaining in the Commons vote that allowed universities to raise tuition fees to \u00a39,000. His report will form part of the government's consultation on its higher education white paper, ahead of drafting a bill in the next session of parliament. Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group, which includes Oxbridge, criticised the proposal to strengthen Offa. \"Financial penalties for not meeting access targets would not only be unfair but they would also reduce money available for programmes to help poorer students win a place at all our universities,\" she said. Liam Burns, the NUS president, said: \"This is a warm-worded but toothless report which does little to mask the chaos of the government's education policy, that has seen fees tripled and vital support such as EMA and AimHigher scrapped in the past year. \"Recommending that all schools and colleges offer university bursary competitions is tokenistic when the upfront support provided to less privileged students through EMA has already been removed.\" The Open University announced on Wednesday that its fee for 2012 would be \u00a35,000 for full-time study in England. Currently, a full-time OU student pays \u00a31,600 annually. A quarter of its latest intake is under 25, but the university's vice-chancellor said he did not expect the announcement would prompt an influx of school-leavers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
