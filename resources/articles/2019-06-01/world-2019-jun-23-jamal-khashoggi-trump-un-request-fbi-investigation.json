A report on Khashoggi\u2019s assassination published last week by the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings said the US should open an FBI inquiry and \u201cpursue criminal prosecutions within the United States, as appropriate\u201d. But in an interview broadcast by NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday Trump brushed the proposal aside. Asked if he would allow the FBI to investigate, Trump said: \u201cI think it\u2019s been heavily investigated.\u201d Asked who had investigated, the president replied: \u201cBy everybody. I mean, I\u2019ve seen so many different reports.\u201d Khashoggi, 59, was a US resident who wrote for the Washington Post. He was killed and dismembered after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October last year, seeking paperwork he needed in order to marry. The UN report contains disturbing details of conversations between unidentified Saudis before and after Khashoggi\u2019s arrival, based on transcripts provided by Turkish authorities. Khashoggi is referred to as a \u201csacrificial animal\u201d. One Saudi official is quoted as asking whether it would \u201cbe possible to put the trunk in a bag\u201d. Another replies: \u201cNo. Too heavy. It is not a problem. The body is heavy. First time I cut on the ground. If we take plastic bags and cut it into pieces, it will be finished. We will wrap each of them.\u201d Transcripts of conversations after Khashoggi\u2019s arrival at the consulate include the journalist saying: \u201cThere is a towel here. Are you going to give me drugs?\u201d The reply: \u201cWe will anaesthetise you.\u201d The UN special rapporteur blamed the Saudi government for the murder and said there was credible evidence that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other senior officials were responsible. Trump told NBC the murder \u201creally didn\u2019t come up\u201d in a call this week with the prince, a key ally of the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who among other responsibilities is charged with implementing a plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Trump also suggested Saudi Arabia was no worse than other states in the Middle East, which he called a \u201cvicious, hostile place\u201d, adding: \u201cLook at Iran, look at other countries, I won\u2019t mention names.\u201d The president then cited a drastically overinflated figure for Saudi spending on US weapons that fact-checkers have previously noted does not match the official record. \u201cI only say they spend $400bn to $450bn over a period of time, all money, all jobs, buying equipment,\u201d Trump said. In fact Saudi Arabia last year signed \u201cletters of offer and acceptance\u201d for $14.5bn in military purchases from the US. The Senate last week voted to block the Trump administration selling arms to Saudi Arabia, seven Republicans joining Democrats to pass the measure. Trump has pledged to use his presidential veto and push on with the sales. While denying he was saying such purchases were \u201cthe price\u201d for Khashoggi\u2019s murder, Trump on Sunday defended his consideration of arms sales in responding to the assassination. \u201cI\u2019m not like a fool that says, \u2018We don\u2019t want to do business with them,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd by the way, if they don\u2019t do business with us, you know what they do? They\u2019ll do business with the Russians or with the Chinese \u2026 \u201cWe make the best equipment in the world, but they will buy great equipment from Russia and from China.\u201d Prince Mohammed has denied responsibility for the murder. Eleven suspects are on trial in Riyadh, five of them facing the death penalty. Confronted with gruesome details from the UN report this week, Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir told CNN the report was \u201cflawed\u201d. \u201cWe know this was a rogue operation that was not authorised,\u201d he said, \u201cwe know that a crime was committed, we have people in jail and on trial as we speak. It\u2019s a gruesome murder that happened outside authorities and for which the people who committed it will be punished \u2026 this should never have happened.\u201d Al-Jubeir also said \u201cmechanisms\u201d were being \u201cput in place to ensure this does not happen again\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
