For the past six months, the pandemic has dominated the three hours he spends on air every weekday. And, alarmingly for a talkshow host, things have become a bit samey. \u201cNormally, I like to have three or four conversational topics in my pocket before we go on air,\u201d he tells me later. \u201cBut since February I have been able to turn up at 10 to 10 knowing we\u2019re going to talk about coronavirus, all day every day, in slightly different ways and forms.\u201d The LBC studios are in London\u2019s Leicester Square; O\u2019Brien and I meet at a restaurant nearby. It is the middle of September, cold and damp, ugly weather. Boris Johnson has just announced amended lockdown measures: pubs will close at 10pm, the rule of six reapplies. A second wave is imminent, despite forewarning, and it has the nation in a muddle. \u201cI had a fortnight off two weeks ago,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. He arrived today straight from his show but refreshed-seeming. We elbow-tapped a greeting; he is easy company. \u201cAnd I realised that I had to come back happy, upbeat, even as we report negativity, even as we continue to report on this catastrophic handling of the coronavirus.\u201d Happiness hasn\u2019t always been the O\u2019Brien remit. Until recently, his show was most captivating when it was fiercely combative, when an opinionated caller rang in about the issue of the day \u2013 immigration, the vague notion of taking back control \u2013 and a fight began. O\u2019Brien refers to himself as a \u201cverbal bruiser\u201d. He has the remarkable ability to recall facts mid-conversation and deliver them succinctly, which makes him a natural for the kind of monologue-driven contest radio that is shared as viral clips. In one corner: O\u2019Brien, voice of reason or left-wing agitator, depending on your politics. And his opponent: an angry caller, outraged by some perceived threat to traditional British values, whatever they are, that O\u2019Brien pokes and probes until he is able to expose the baselessness of their ideas. O\u2019Brien is 48. He joined LBC full-time in 2004. For a long time, he was relatively unknown at the station. (During his first show, his wife called in under a false name to rescue him from a silent switchboard.) But Brexit turned him into a star. \u201cI became, I think, a salve for a lot of people,\u201d he says. He considered Brexit a painful act of self-sabotage. So did many of his 1.2m weekly listeners. \u201cI just think we all thought we were going mad, those of us who were following things properly, those of us who were perhaps resistant to the idea that sovereignty could actually put food on the table.\u201d But his show has changed of late. \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy holding up the mirror to people who don\u2019t want to look as much as I used to,\u201d he says now. For one, he\u2019s not sure it did any of his callers any good. \u201cI changed the opinions of the people listening,\u201d he says. \u201cBut very few people went away having been embarrassed on the show convinced they were wrong.\u201d For this reason, O\u2019Brien has sworn off taking calls from people who dial in just to debate. Besides, what\u2019s left to argue about? Not Brexit. \u201cThat ship sailed in December. It\u2019s over. We lost.\u201d He gives another example. \u201cI won\u2019t have conspiracy theorists on any more,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is risky, because it can make great radio. And there is a constituency of listeners that loves nothing more than to see me locking horns with a\u2026\u201d He trails off. \u201cAs I get older, I feel a sense of responsibility.\u201d A few years ago, O\u2019Brien noticed he often entered arguments just to win them, and that winning arguments had become more important to him than accepting what was right. On the radio he could be cruel or dismissive to callers, especially those who proved his own arguments wobbly. \u201cI found it almost impossible to retreat from any position,\u201d he writes in How Not To Be Wrong, his new book, \u201ceven if I\u2019d only arrived at it five minutes ago.\u201d By his own admission, he became \u201can insufferable dinner party guest\u201d. For as long as he could remember, he\u2019d lived in \u201ca highly adrenalised state \u2013 an almost permanent fight or flight condition,\u201d as though he were always about to come under verbal attack. He explains this over lunch: how he realised he had become hardwired to argue, his perpetual \u201con\u201d condition, the bind he\u2019d found himself in. \u201cIt began to seem ridiculous,\u201d he says. It sounds exhausting, I say. \u201cDo you not get that?\u201d he asks. \u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cIs that alien to you?\u201d \u201cFor it to be a permanent state, yes.\u201d \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know it was a permanent state,\u201d he says. He seems resigned. \u201cIt was just the state. I thought it was normal to wake up every morning with a bolus of tension in my tummy so acute I could sometimes retch while I was brushing my teeth. It was just there, what I would now describe as anxiety, but which I would then have described as preparedness.\u201d For many years, he thought of this preparedness as central to his character. This was why he was able to win so many arguments. This was why he had become so successful. \u201cNot true, evidently. But I didn\u2019t know there was any other way to live. I didn\u2019t know there was another me.\u201d I ask what he was afraid of happening. \u201cEverything,\u201d he says. He worried about losing the job he loved, about not being able to support his family, that the bottom might fall out from under the life he\u2019d built. \u201cBut I thought the price you paid for being on top of the world was feeling like shit. I just presumed that was the transaction. That was life\u2019s transaction.\u201d In 2017, a person very close to O\u2019Brien became seriously unwell, and his family was forced to deal with what he describes as \u201ca huge trauma\u201d. When the news broke, O\u2019Brien discovered to his horror that he was unable to provide help and support. \u201cI was confronted with the evidence that parts of my personality were failing to properly make a contribution to the scenario.\u201d Instead of offering care, all he could do was \u201ctry to argue the illness away\u201d. He felt vulnerable and lost. \u201cI used to do this with my wife,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Are you OK? Is everything all right?\u2019 And I realised that I wasn\u2019t doing it for her benefit. I wasn\u2019t being caring or compassionate. Bollocks. I was doing it so she could reassure me that we weren\u2019t about to be hit over the head with another shock, another disaster, another fight.\u201d Despairing, he tried praying, but that didn\u2019t help, and he tried crying, but that didn\u2019t help either. So he tried therapy, which he thought was pointless, but what did he have to lose? \u201cI can\u2019t stress how cynical I was,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I thought: I\u2019m desperate. I wasn\u2019t helping. I wasn\u2019t equipped to help. Because without realising it I\u2019d seen everything in my life as a fight, and I thought I had to be like that, that that was who I was, that you fight everything.\u201d He laughs. \u201cSometimes you can\u2019t.\u201d I ask, \u201cWhat do you mean, you tried to argue the illness away?\u201d \u201cI was of the view that the best form of defence was attack,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I came out all guns blazing, and it made things worse.\u201d Therapy turned out to be illuminating. \u201cI came out of the first session feeling 3st lighter,\u201d he says, \u201cand we hadn\u2019t actually done any work.\u201d They began by discussing his childhood, \u201cwhich is what they do, that\u2019s the trick!\u201d O\u2019Brien grew up in Kidderminster. He was adopted when he was a month old. He remembers his upbringing fondly, but school was difficult. Between 10 and 13 he was beaten, terribly, by the headteacher at his Worcestershire prep, a big man who kept a paddle in his office. He later went to Ampleforth, a Catholic boarding school run by monks that has had its own reckoning with abuse. O\u2019Brien wasn\u2019t beaten by teachers at Ampleforth, but fights among pupils were common, and O\u2019Brien, an average-sized kid, relied on his ability to win arguments to get through. In his book, he describes this ability as his \u201cgift\u201d \u2013 to make people \u201cfeel small and stupid in order to shore up the often false notion that I was \u2018right\u2019 and they were \u2018wrong\u2019.\u201d He adds: \u201cWhen you spend your formative years expecting an attack from any angle, you don\u2019t notice what it\u2019s done to you until the process of self-protection is complete.\u201d At the restaurant, he recalls a defining moment during therapy. \u201cThe question was something like, \u2018So, you got beaten a lot at school. How did that make you feel?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, great, it was like a badge of honour. I got beaten more times in one term than anybody else in the history of school.\u2019 And the therapist said: \u2018Really? That made you feel good?\u2019 Cue the silence. This endless, endless silence. And it was like being hit on the head. I said, \u2018No, no. It really didn\u2019t make me feel good. It really fucking hurt.\u2019\u201d He slips into the second person now, as though he is talking to himself. \u201cAnd you realise as you say this that, you know what? It still does.\u201d During one of his sessions, the therapist asked: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you pretend that cushion over there is you, aged 10, having just come out of that study, having been brutalised by that man\u2026 Why don\u2019t you tell 10-year-old you how you feel?\u201d \u201cAnd I did,\u201d O\u2019Brien recalls, \u201clike it was the most natural thing in the world.\u201d He looks half-sceptical even now. \u201cThere I was telling a cushion that everything was going to be all right, that you don\u2019t have to pretend any more, that it shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d He realised that as a boy he had created a kind of armour, and that the armour had manifested as a tendency to argue, of letting nobody get the better of him, of always being alert to attack. \u201cAnd look what it\u2019s done to you,\u201d he says. He is talking to himself again, weary now. \u201cYou can\u2019t provide help and support to the people you love, to people who deserve it.\u201d I ask if he is capable of providing love now. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. I ask for an example. \u201cOne of my best friends is dying from brain cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the old me would have been trying to treat the cancer as if it was a tennis opponent. I\u2019d be encouraging him to fight. But you can\u2019t.\u201d The cancer is terminal. \u201cIt\u2019s not if, it\u2019s when. So I realise now that what he needs from me is love and comfort and company and jokes, and not letting every moment of every day be defined by this awful thing that\u2019s happening.\u201d All of this has been revelatory, he says. His inclination to argue, his readiness to fight \u2013 it all emerged from the traumas of his childhood. He understands now: the process of self-protection, a coping mechanism. After therapy, it was as though a weight had lifted, as though he had discovered a new part of himself. O\u2019Brien uses the analogy of the home. \u201cImagine living in the same house all your life and suddenly finding a garden,\u201d he says, \u201cand very enthusiastically running around looking for new ways of thinking, new ways of seeing the world.\u201d As soon as he discovered the garden, he felt free. In How Not To Be Wrong, O\u2019Brien discusses a list of subjects about which he has held misinformed opinions: he once supported corporal punishment; for a while he was in favour of the police tactic of indiscriminate stop and search; he thought teachers shouldn\u2019t have tattoos. In each case he dissects and explains the ways he has been wrong, and argues how admitting his wrongness has ultimately helped him become a better person. When he began writing the book, he asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use yourself as material? Why don\u2019t you work out how you ended up thinking harmful things? I thought: if I can do this for myself, then maybe I can help other people climb down from their furiously held but not entirely defensible positions.\u201d O\u2019Brien thinks we are ridiculous for grudgingly holding on to opinions that can be proved objectively wrong, and he\u2019s concerned by what he sees as our inability to understand that accepting when we are wrong is a strength. \u201cIn much of society today,\u201d he writes, \u201cI see open-mindedness derided as a weakness and the widespread embracing of demonstrably dangerous and dishonest positions purely to upset the \u2018other side\u2019.\u201d He once had a caller who said he supported a right-wing politician despite knowing he was a liar and a charlatan, just because the politician\u2019s position upset those on the left. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d O\u2019Brien says now. Then he sighs. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to make progress if we refuse to listen to each other.\u201d I ask him why this is all so important, accepting when we are wrong. \u201cBecause of the harm it does,\u201d he says. \u201cTo ourselves and the people around us.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the national interest,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at what Johnson\u2019s charged with doing now. He\u2019s charged with writing the road map for the next part of the Covid journey while refusing to admit that he got anything wrong during the first part of the journey. I mean, it\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s beyond parody. Both economically and in terms of deaths, we\u2019re among the worst in the world. And yet he still does it. I think that\u2019s psychological. I think that\u2019s hardwired into him. But if he could be honest about his own failure, then I would trust him more about what\u2019s coming next.\u201d He adds: \u201cIn the simplest terms, it\u2019s about trust. If you never admit when you\u2019re wrong, you eventually become untrustable.\u201d So O\u2019Brien\u2019s show is softer now, more gentle. For some time it has been a home of empathy and understanding. The world hasn\u2019t stopped arguing, but O\u2019Brien has mostly opted out. Given he\u2019s no longer as quick to squabble on air, I ask, \u201care you worried\u2026\u201d \u201cThat I might have therapised myself out of a job?\u201d he finishes. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cI am!\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re a kinder you,\u201d I say. \u201cBut it\u2019s still there,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are impulses and reflexes I\u2019ve honed and polished over 40 years. I still feel it rising up, and sometimes it escapes.\u201d He thinks for a moment. \u201cI hope I can still be trusted company,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when I\u2019m not grabbing people by the scruff of the neck and forcing them to confront their opinions.\u201d How Not To Be Wrong by James O\u2019Brien is published by Ebury at \u00a314.99, or buy it for \u00a312.74 at guardianbookshop.com Photographer\u2019s assistant Bertie Oakes; grooming by Charlie Cullen using using Kevin Murphy Hair Care and Nars Skin Care"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
