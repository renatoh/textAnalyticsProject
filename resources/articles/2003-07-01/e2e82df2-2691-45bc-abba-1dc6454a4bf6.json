I am, in fact, now almost as bored by stupid men on TV as I have ever been bored by them in real life. Except that in real life I don't actually know any stupid men. Or, rather, I don't know any men whose stupidity turns them into Gap chinos-wearing Stan Laurels whose personalities are a selection of Asperger's syndrome tics, quirks and repetitive buzzphrases. The latest addition to the genre is Fortysomething, in which Hugh Laurie plays a 44-year-old married father-of-three and GP called Paul Slippery. The Slipperys have three sons called Daniel, Rory and Edwin and they all live in a nice big house and talk proper, even as they say nothing at all. Estelle Slippery makes observations such as 'No woman over 40 is happy with her upper arms' but as she is played by the lovely Anna Chancellor, who is 38 and has upper arms like a prima ballerina, this sort of line, however true, doesn't exactly resonate. Laurie is very good at doing bug-eyed bafflement and interrogative whingeing; indeed he's fashioned an entire career out of it, but this character has nothing more to add to the usual tired clich\u00e9s of middle-aged masculinity. There is none of the delirious bathos created by a Fawlty or a David Brent, just a few good one-liners left hanging sadly around the perimeters of the plot like a single sock stranded in the dryer. In fact, I fully anticipate a joke about socks-in-dryers before the series is through. An hour is a long time to watch something that hasn't quite decided if it's a sitcom or a comedy drama. Like Cold Feet, Fortysomething has no canned laughter cues, though the script has all the hallmarks of traditional sitcom glibness. For instance, in the first episode Paul Slippery repeated, over and over and with increasingly pantomime-emphasis, the words 'You Should Be At School!' to his youngest son, yet we didn't find out why his son wasn't at school and we didn't learn why Slippery was so wildly ineffective as a male role model that his kids habitually bunked off, turned their home into something out of How Clean Is Your Home? and had casual sex with each other's girlfriends in the daytime while dad listened in. Farcical plotlines - a middle-aged patient of Slippery's dying 'on the job' from a Viagra overdose, Estelle Slippery being made redundant as she arrived for her first day back at work after raising the kids - came jumping out at the first round bell, ready to fight against bigger themes such as memory loss, schizophrenia and the arid emotional landscape of middle-aged married couples, but all the ideas lost the comedy bout on sheer pointlessness. Obviously I'm taking this too seriously. Presumably I was meant to smile when 32 fridge-freezers turned up at the Slippery household for no apparent reason, or when Paul was reminded by one of his smug sons that it was his twentieth wedding anniversary (has a middle-aged telly bloke ever remembered his wedding anniversary? Doh!) or when a pleasure boat was set loose from its river mooring and - ha! ha! - headed towards a weir while Slippery ended up in the drink ... so far, so Terry and June. Mind you, that ran for about 200 years, so there's no particular reason to assume Fortysomething won't be a hit. Interesting, however, that the idea of a bright and capable man married to a borderline-moronic woman is about as amusing a premise for a comedy drama as something set in an Islington care home in the 1980s. Having reached an age where I can be out and proud about balmy summer Sundays spent wandering around botanical gardens before repairing to Home Counties pubs for shandy and scampi, I am seriously contemplating joining the National Trust. Indeed, the only thing that stops me is knowing that from there it is but a hop, skip and wobbly jump to purchasing a caravan, entering the Reader's Digest prize draw and taking up needlework and Nimbyism. Still, I enjoyed Five's armchair pick of the Trust in the form of the Reader's Digest series (Gardens, Statelies, Ancient Monuments...) and particularly the top 10 Finest Castles which was full of did-you-know pub-quiz factoids: there are more than 2,500 castles in the UK, and Caernarvon (number 9) cost \u00a327,000 to build, which was roughly Edward I's annual income. Miriam Margolyes showed us around Alnwick (number 8 and now better known as Hogwarts), describing it as 'the most castley castle I've ever seen', while Michael Portillo claimed that Elizabeth's I's incarceration in the Tower of London (number 5) probably made her 'a better politician', in which case a stay should be compulsory for all aspiring MPs and, while we're at it, let's turn that idea into a reality TV show. Meanwhile, Sandi Toksvig told us that Henry II kept a polar bear in the Tower that he used to take fishing on the Thames until the day it wandered upriver to Richmond. And it was good to see a personal favourite, the absurdly pretty Bodiam castle in East Sussex, make it to number 4, even if it is 'all mouth and no trousers' and, according to Robert Hardy, just 'an old soldier's dream house' rather than an effective stronghold. The 'winner', incidentally, of this light summer breeze of a show was Warwick, while Kent's lovely Leeds castle didn't even make it into the top 10. As shock revelations go, this was right up there with the one that Tim Henman whiles away rain breaks before losing matches by playing backgammon with Mark Philippoussis, rather than, say, reading a book (an activity he described this week as 'boring'. And I could've sworn he'd be a Potter man). In other words, it wasn't a shock and it wasn't a revelation and, come July, when we put away adult things and prepare to grub around in our inner sandpit, that's pretty much how I like my telly. Richard White is an Englishman whose home is not only his castle but his opera house. Access to the auditorium is via the kitchen and Mrs White, disabled by a stroke, can't retire for the evening until her bedroom has been reclaimed from the divas who use it as a dressing room, a domestic arrangement which prompts much bemusement among White's neighbours in the sleepy-and-proud-of-it Norfolk village of Claxton. BBC4's The Man With An Opera House in His Living Room focused on White's planning permission battles with the local council, run-ins with the neighbours and ambitious production of Mozart's Il Seraglio set in a 1960s religious cult and starring a Chitty-Chitty Mini Cooper. As with all the best British documentaries this was a film about English eccentricity, rampant Nimbyism and class, but how much more fun it would be if White had a go at staging a version of the National Theatre's Jerry Springer: The Opera (currently the very best thing on TV that isn't on TV) - if the neighbours can't stomach Mozart you can only rub your hands with glee at the thought of their response to a white-trash chorus belting out 'Slut Junkie, Crack-Whore, Three Nipple Cousin Fu**er...' And while watching Channel 4's delightfully titled Rod Hull: A Bird In The Hand, it occurred to me that it was just as well Hull hadn't been a ventriloquist because that's precisely the kind of thing the Emu might have muttered out of the side of its beak at a Royal Variety Show. Hull was apparently rather angry when he found himself in late middle age still with his arm up a raffia bird. Mind you, in his glory days, when the violent glove-puppet was his passport to owning a Grade I listed mansion called Restoration House (the restoration of which bankrupted him), the married father of five was apparently a bit of a one for the birds. But did they want him for him, or just his great big accessory? I think there's the germ of an idea for a comedy drama sitcom-thingy in there somewhere, but it will have to go on the back-burner while I work up my idea for another new sitcom which, not having Mark Philippoussis to play with, I conceived during several days of Wimbledon rain breaks. Anyway, it's called Out! and revolves around two angry middle-aged also-ran British male tennis players reduced to sharing a flat together in Wimbledon while they work as groundsmen at the All England Club. I think this idea's definitely got legs - which is probably more than can be said for Tim Henman's career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
