Rather, it is that when confronted with history, their sense of purpose prevails. Seldom this season have Chelsea been so sensational as they were in dispatching Valencia on Tuesday night, where tenacity and talent combined to overcome a half-time deficit and set up a Champions League semi-final against Liverpool. It is Chelsea's third appearance in the last four of the competition in the past four years but, by disregarding the moment, this time Chelsea appear capable of something momentous. \"I don't think there's any need to talk about history,\" said Frank Lampard. \"People talk about 'We've done this' and 'We've done that in the past.' Doesn't matter. What matters is the history you create there and then. \"I think we're approaching every game as a cup final and that's a great mentality to have. If you approach it with a relaxed attitude you're going to come unstuck, so maybe that's helping us at the moment. The important thing is we never lose that because to keep that going to the end of the season is a big ask and that's something we'll have to make sure we do as a group and individually.\" Two years ago Chelsea also faced Liverpool in a Champions League semi-final, but there will be very individual memories of that evening. Jose Mourinho still bemoans the \"goal that wasn't a goal\", Luis Garc\u00eda's strike at Anfield that separated the teams. John Terry was left in tears, the outcome shattering him personally as much as it did his ambitions. But he insists he is not drawn in to thoughts of vengeance. \"The semi-final left some hurtful memories and we're again in the semi-final,\" said the England captain. \"Of course we want to win but I don't want to start on about revenge time or anything like that. That's completely not what I'm saying, but it's a chance to wash those memories away. \"Liverpool are going fantastically well in the Champions League, they're looking fresh and it's going to be interesting, us versus them again. They're a very, very tough side. But things are going well for us at the moment. We're not getting carried away; we're not thinking of the quadruple at the moment. But we're in every competition, we're looking fit, we're looking sharp and strong and so it's a possibility.\" Earlier this season it had seemed that for all their mental fortitude, physical weakness would destroy Chelsea's campaign. But from adversity, they have emerged stronger. Michael Essien declined the offer of a holiday to play in Valencia after overcoming a knee injury and scored the winner. Joe Cole came on as a half-time substitute after serial injuries of his own and helped ravage the Spanish team. Then there is Petr Cech who, having fractured his skull earlier this season, has not conceded a Premiership goal since the two on his return at Liverpool. Terry, too, feels fitter for his own lay-off for back surgery. \"The lads are feeling really good at the minute,\" he said. \"It's only Arjen Robben who isn't fit and it's great to have everyone fit. Those players coming back have had a couple of months' rest. \"It wasn't great early on in the season, we had a few injuries, but now we've got players back who've had a couple of months off. We've got fresh legs about the place now.\" Success over the next six weeks is expected to determine the future of Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge and though the FA Cup semi-final against Blackburn this weekend is the next test, if Chelsea could select their silverware it is the European prize they would plump for. \"This is one trophy that a lot of us at the club want, it means an awful lot to us,\" said Terry before hinting that the owner Roman Abramovich is on the case too. \"A lot of it stems from the manager and the other people around the club as well.\" Finally it is left to Lampard to explain that mentality is again the key. \"If you're going to win anything big in football these days, be it the Premier League or the Champions League especially, you have to perform on the edge, you have to perform on the big nights when your backs are against the wall, because it will happen,\" he said. \"We can only [win everything] by concentrating game by game as we have to do now and change our minds on to the FA Cup. So, yes, the dream is still there but there's a long way to go to do it.\" Chelsea have made history their purpose."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
