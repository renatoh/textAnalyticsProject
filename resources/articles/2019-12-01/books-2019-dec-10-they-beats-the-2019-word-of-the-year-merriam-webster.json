The US dictionary, which has been in print for more than 150 years, said that look-ups for \u201cthey\u201d increased by 313% in 2019 compared with the previous year, as the public investigated the word\u2019s shifting use and its increasing prominence in the news. \u201cEnglish famously lacks a gender-neutral singular pronoun to correspond neatly with singular pronouns like \u2018everyone\u2019 or \u2018someone\u2019, and as a consequence \u2018they\u2019 has been used for this purpose for over 600 years,\u201d said Merriam-Webster. \u201cMore recently, though, \u2018they\u2019 has also been used to refer to one person whose gender identity is non-binary, a sense that is increasingly common in published, edited text, as well as social media and in daily personal interactions between English speakers.\u201d In September, the dictionary added this definition to its entry for \u201cthey\u201d. The pronoun beat other contenders for the word of the year including the phrase \u201cquid pro quo\u201d, which saw look-ups boom by 644% following the investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s phone conversation with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cExculpate,\u201d defined as \u201cto clear from alleged fault or guilt\u201d, was also in the running, with a spike of 23,000% in look-ups following special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony in July that \u201cthe president was not exculpated for the acts that he allegedly committed\u201d. More recently, people have been driven to investigate the meaning of \u201cimpeach\u201d, with the largest single spike following Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement of an impeachment inquiry on 24 September. \u201cThey\u201d was also competing with another building block of the English language: \u201cthe\u201d. According to Merriam-Webster, it is \u201ctruly rare to see one of the most basic function words in the English language spike in our data\u201d, but after the Ohio State University filed a trademark application in August for the word \u201cthe\u201d with the US Patent Office, look-ups for \u201cthe\u201d spiked 500%. The dictionary noted that Ohio State\u2019s application was made \u201cin order to protect new branding logos that emphasise the \u2018The\u2019 that is part of the official (some say pretentious) name of the institution\u201d.
