According to a \"friend\" who has been widely quoted in the gossip rags, \"Tom and Katie really have amazing chemistry. They want to show the world how much.\" This seems like a very peculiar thing to want to show the world - and to expect the world to want to see. Cynics would no doubt say that it's to quash persistent rumours that theirs is a marriage of convenience. But even if they generate \"chemistry\" in this photoshoot, that is no proof they have chemistry in real life. Screen chemistry is a mysterious thing, a mystery not dispelled by calling it chemistry: a scientific metaphor does not render an ineffable quality quantifiable. Like \"charisma\", the idea of screen \"chemistry\" is really just a semantic place-holder, a word used for lack of a better term to describe the way in which some people are interesting to watch and others aren't (in this sense, we might say that \"charisma\" is the singular and \"chemistry\" the plural). When used to describe Mr and Mrs Cruise's putative feelings for each other, however, it's just an ordinary metaphor, meaning something like \"passion\". Quite apart from questions of whether they're protesting too much, the idea that their personal feelings of \"chemistry\" will necessarily register on camera is clearly fallacious, as Cruise himself should have learned when he watched Eyes Wide Shut. Many of history's most successful cinematic teams had no actual romantic involvement, a fact that calls to mind Laurence Olivier's famous suggestion to Dustin Hoffman, when preparing for Marathon Man, that he might try acting. One of the most legendary examples of screen chemistry of all time did not want to work together at all. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were reluctantly teamed for 10 films by their studio; their chemistry was inadvertent, and they both rather resented it. Myrna Loy and William Powell, who made 14 films in as many years, were great friends but never lovers; their \"chemistry\" is not primarily sexual, but is a kind of gestalt collaborative energy that makes them a joy to watch, and helped them bring out the best in each other. In a similar vein, Doris Day and Rock Hudson's fondness for each other meant that they could produce an erotic frisson that they obviously did not actually feel. Of course, some of the greatest onscreen couples had offscreen relationships, although their vaunted celluloid \"chemistry\" often seems to have had more than a little to do with the erotic charge of the forbidden. Most of them were either adulterous liaisons or had to be clandestine in the days when so-called morality clauses charged that movie stars had to (pretend to) live exemplary lives offscreen. Garbo and Gilbert, Gable and Crawford, Bogart and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy, Taylor and Burton, all carried on illicit affairs while making films together - as, more recently, did Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, who also generated an awful lot of cinematic heat in their first film together, Mr &amp; Mrs Smith. And, of course, they also generated an awful lot of publicity. But it has ever been thus. When Greta Garbo and her lover, John Gilbert, were set to star in a version of Anna Karenina with the working title Heat, their affair was so public that the title had to be changed to Love, so that the posters could read \"Garbo and Gilbert in Love\" rather than \"Garbo and Gilbert in Heat\". Maybe Mr and Mrs Cruise think that the equation can work the other way around. \u00b7 Sarah Churchwell is senior lecturer in American literature and culture at the University of East Anglia s.churchwell@uea.ac.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
