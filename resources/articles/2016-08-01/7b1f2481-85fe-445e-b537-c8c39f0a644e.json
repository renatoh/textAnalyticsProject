Well done to Colombia, but they go home, and USA march through in first place. Thanks for reading \u2013 bye. The Colombians celebrate \u2013 they\u2019ve won their first Olympic point against the best team in the world. USA were the better team, on balance, but one goalkeeping error and one piece of brilliance have Colombia a share of the points. No blame attached to Hope Solo for the second goal, though. And the Colombians earn an historic point! 90 min +2: A minute left, and USA win a corner. 90 min: What a brilliant goal from the Colombian. It was such a tight angle, with her left foot from the right side, but she hit it with pace and dip, and it beat Solo and nestled in the top corner. Outstanding! Another free kick from Catalina Usme \u2013 and it was brilliant! 89 min: Colombia win a free kick in the final third. Last chance? 87 min: Nice work from Pugh, who drives forward and feeds Morgan, who goes to the corner flag. Gaitan is booked for an earlier infraction. 85 min: Yellow card to Ali Krieger for time-wasting, which seems a bit unfair. 82 min: Still time for more goals, although neither side seems to be in a great hurry to change that. 79 min: These players have played three games in six days. This has been some effort. 77 min: Usme shoots, and it\u2019s off the top of the crossbar! What an effort! Solo might have had that covered \u2013 it was pretty central \u2013 but that was a fabulous strike from long range. 76 min: Colombia haven\u2019t really managed to create anything since the goal, but they\u2019ve got a free kick 40 yards from goal, and a chance to get it in the box. 74 min: Pugh burns Clavijo on the left side, and cuts it back for Long, who, weirdly, went with the outside of her right foot rather than her left, and her effort was blocked. 72 min: Yellow card for Liana Salazar for a foul on Long, and the crowd whistle and jeer. She caught Long in the face but was perhaps a bit unlucky: it didn\u2019t appear to be intentional. 70 min: USA happy to keep the ball for now. 68 min: There\u2019s much more space now for USA to exploit. Colombia have tired somewhat, but they\u2019re also prepared to commit more players forward. Usme produces some lovely skill by the corner flag, which brings gasps from the crowd, but it comes to naught. 65 min: Final change for USA: Morgan Brian, who\u2019s been impressive, is replaced by Allie Long. 64 min: Colombia clear the corner, but it\u2019s tossed back in towards Press, who heads wide. France now lead 2-0 against New Zealand, but if USA win here, they\u2019ll top the group regardless. 63 min: Horan\u2019s header \u2013 tipped over by Sepulveda! 61 min: Pugh has the ball in the net, but it\u2019s offside. That was a bum pass by Press \u2013 she\u2019d have been better off taking the shot. For Colombia, Diana Ospina is on for Lady Andrade. 60 min: USA had attacked with vigor, and Dunn went down the left, taking a clutch of defenders with her. Her cross was missed by everyone, but Pugh controlled at the back post, took a touch inside, and fired a shot past a posse of defenders on the line. USA lead, and it\u2019s deserved. And it\u2019s the 18-year-old! 55 min: USA should really be ahead, considering the amount of possession they\u2019ve had and the chances they\u2019ve created. But they aren\u2019t! 53 min: Morgan fizzes one just over the bar! Long ball from Press, Morgan races over the top, and the control is perfect, but the shot is just too high! 50 min: Horan is denied by Sepulveda! Lovely build up, and Horan just tried to bend it round the corner, but the Colombian stopper pushed it over the bar. Sent in, and Echeverri cranes her neck to head it clear. 48 min: USA beginning the second half as they finished the first: on the front foot. 46 min: France still leading New Zealand at the half. And a change for Colombia: Isabella Echeverri is on for Orianica Velasquez. Oh, and Carli Lloyd seems to have been withdrawn for Alex Morgan. That\u2019s the half, and it was reasonably entertaining! See you shortly for more. 45 min +1: Pugh goes to the byline, but can\u2019t quite wrap her foot around it, and it\u2019s behind for a goal kick. 45 min: Two minutes of stoppage time. Horan\u2019s had a good game in midfield, by the way. 44 min: Horan finds some space in the box but heads over! Unlucky. 43 min: Press found Lloyd with a lovely flick round the corner, Lloyd smashed it at goal, and Sepulveda did well to get hands to it, but it bounced up and off the bar, and Dunn reacted quickest to prod home. Normal service appears to have been resumed. Crystal Dunn! USA are level! 41 min: Foul on Horan by Clavijo, right on the edge of the box, but there was an offside call, and it\u2019ll be a Colombia free kick. 40 min: Oh, Sepulveda saves from Press! It was just a long hoof from the back, but Press read it well, beat Arias to the ball, but couldn\u2019t beat Sepulveda, who had come off limits to make herself big. Good save, but Press was all alone, and would presumably like to have that one back. 38 min: Horan miscontrols by the left touchline, and it\u2019s out for a Colombia throw. France are leading New Zealand 1-0, by the way. 37 min: O\u2019Hara\u2019s ball in, right-footed, from the left flank, and Dunn heads wide! She was free in the box, but never really looked confident with the header. If only that was Carli Lloyd, eh? 34 min: USA were in cruise control up until that goal; now they\u2019re finding life just a touch more difficult. Colombia happy to sit on their lead. 32 min: Well, that\u2019s Rapinoe\u2019s day done: she was only scheduled to play half an hour, and Mallory Pugh is on her stead. Purely a precautionary measure for a player returning from a bad injury. Some really good things from Rapinoe near Colombia\u2019s goal, but a daft tackle for the Colombia opener. 30 min: Sepulveda, the goalie, is down, and we\u2019ll take a break. 29 min: The sparse Brazilian crowd, who have enjoyed taunting Solo so far in these Games, are enjoying this. 28 min: We can reasonably say that that goal came against the run of play. But that past two or three minutes was better from Colombia. Also, Rapinoe was reckless in making the tackle that led to the free kick. 27 min: Well, well, well! Usme hit it well enough, with her left foot, but it was straight at Solo \u2013 who just couldn\u2019t keep it out! It bounced just in front of her, and maybe that put her off, but it was a regulation save, and she just messed up. The first goal USA have conceded at this tournament, and Colombia lead! Oh no! It went straight through Hope Solo\u2019s legs! 24 min: First spell of possession for Colombia, and Sauerbrunn has to be alert to make the tackle. Then Salazar is tripped from Rapinoe 20 yards from goal, and this is a chance. Poor tackle from Rapinoe \u2013 she was off her feet. 22 min: Still not much happening for Colombia in attack, but they\u2019ve just about navigated the first 20 minutes. They\u2019re still camped in their own half, though. 20 min: So close from Morgan Brian! She crashed into the box, taking defenders with her, and Sepulveda just managed to flick it behind for a corner. Rapinoe takes, and hits it out for a throw on the other side. 19 min: Was Lloyd tripped in the box there? Referee Teodora Albon shakes her head. 18 min: Crystal Dunn accepts one in space on the right side, but her touch lets her down, under pressure from Clavijo, and it\u2019s behind for a goal kick. 16 min: The stadium is slowly filling up \u2013 Brazil, replete with the brilliant Marta, play South Africa in a couple of hours. Sepulveda spills one from Rapinoe\u2019s cross, but Lloyd can\u2019t quite make it count. 14 min: Colombia are so deep. Whenever it\u2019s played forward to Andrade, she has no support, and it just keeps coming back. A goal for USA is surely only a matter of time. 13 min: Press smashes one towards goal, but it\u2019s over the bar. 12 min: This game has been played almost exclusively in Colombia\u2019s half. Colombia can\u2019t string three passes together. 10 min: Press goes into the penalty area as USA attack again, but Gaitain is quickly across to snuff out the danger and concede the corner. Headed clear, but Colombia can\u2019t complete the clearance, until Gaitan does well to win the free kick off Lloyd. 8 min: Rapinoe hits it, but it\u2019s always curling over the bar. 7 min: USA have played Colombia five times in history, and lost five. They haven\u2019t scored a goal, either. Crude tackle by Gaitan, the skipper, on Horan, and this is a good area for a free kick, 20 yards from goal. 6 min: Colombia haven\u2019t really been out of their own half, and USA have a corner. It\u2019s behind for a goal kick. 5 min: A lovely flick from Rapinoe puts Horan in down the left side, but she can\u2019t quite find the cross. Still, Rapinoe looks as though she\u2019s never been away. 3 min: Lloyd heads against the crossbar! Actually, the flag was up for offside, so it wouldn\u2019t have counted, but it was a great cross from the left from Rapinoe, and Lloyd got up highest. Good start, this, from USA, and now Horan is almost there! Blocked, and hacked clear by Colombia. 2 min: USA are on the front foot here, and already Colombia are very deep. 1 min: It\u2019s 91F and 48% humidity, and Colombia get us going. While we listen to the anthems, it\u2019s worth remembering that USA, of course, beat Colombia 2-0 in the women\u2019s World Cup last year, with goals from Alex Morgan and Carli Lloyd. Colombia looked OK in that tournament, but they\u2019ve been poor here, and that New Zealand loss was a bad one. Maybe they can salvage a point, and save some face, here. Colombian fans can hope, anyway. The teams have just emerged from the tunnel. The pitch looks beautiful, but there are a lot of empty seats. Megan Rapinoe is back in action for the first time in 249 days, since that bad knee injury in December. She\u2019s pumped: A few changes from Jill Ellis: Ali Krieger comes in for Meghan Klingenberg, and Megan Rapinoe and Christen Press are given starting spots. Alex Morgan drops to the bench. Colombia look like 4-5-1 with Lady Andrade the furthest forward. Colombia: Sepulveda, Carolina Arias, Nataly Arias, Ariza, Clavijo, Salazar, Santos, Usme, Velasquez, Gaitan, Andrade. Subs: Perez, Arbelaez, Ospina, Echeverri, Vidal, Pineda, Regnier. USA: Solo, O\u2019Hara, Sauerbrunn, Engen, Krieger, Brian, Horan, Rapinoe, Lloyd, Dunn, Press. Subs: Pugh, Long, Klingenberg, Johnston, Morgan, Heath, Naeher. Ref: Teodora Albon (Romania) A couple of results from earlier: Australia hammered Zimbabwe 6-1, and a good win for Canada, who beat Germany 2-1. Canada finish top of Group F with three victories from three. The US women are already through to the last eight of these Rio Games, but a win today against Colombia in Manaus would give them three wins from three, which is always nice. USA have so far looked solid without being spectacular, but they started slowly in the World Cup last year, and their ability here in Brazil to grind out results has the rest of the competition looking on ominously. It\u2019s going to be hot and muggy in the Amazon, with temperatures well into the 90s, and Colombia are already out, having lost to France and New Zealand already. USA are heavy favorites, but we\u2019ll see. Kick off is at 7pm local time. Join us then! Tim will be here shortly. Meantime, have a look to see who made it into our 20 greatest female soccer players of all time:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
