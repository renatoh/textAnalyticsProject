Cynthia Lennon finally wins her place in pop history", "bodyText": "The true identity of the \u201cfifth Beatle\u201d is a contentious matter for fans of the Fab Four. The name of Stuart Sutcliffe, John Lennon\u2019s close friend, is often put forward, as is the ousted drummer, Pete Best. Others claim the title for manager Brian Epstein or record producer George Martin. Yet Cynthia Lennon, the artist by the young Lennon\u2019s side for a decade, is never even considered. Now a new play about the powerful influence of the first Mrs Lennon is to make the case that she held the band together during the years of their greatest success. \u201cI want to get across how important she was in John\u2019s life, and not just because of their son Julian,\u201d said playwright Mike Howl. \u201cJohn used to write to her every single day while he was out in Hamburg, playing in the night clubs of the Reeperbahn. Her friends told me they saw some of these letters. I do think that without Cynthia\u2019s love, John would have gone completely off the rails.\u201d Howl\u2019s stage tribute, This Girl, will premiere in Liverpool later this summer, and he believes it will finally give proper credit to her creativity and to the stabilising effect she had on her young husband. \u201cTheir relationship helped to keep the Beatles together for as long as they were,\u201d said Howl. Born Cynthia Powell, the gifted illustrator grew up in Hoylake on the Wirral peninsula and first met Lennon as a fellow student at art school in Liverpool in 1957. The two became inseparable and their relationship even withstood Lennon\u2019s one-night stands when the Beatles found international success. They married in 1962, and before their divorce in 1968 she witnessed the Beatles\u2019 transformation from popular Liverpool group to global stars. Several of her cartoon-style drawings of the band\u2019s early years are displayed at th Beatles Story museum in Liverpool\u2019s Albert Dock following a London exhibition of her work in 1999. One shows John tickling the bald head of a man reading a newspaper in front of him on a bus. \u201cThe man kept scratching his head, thinking it was a fly. I was embarrassed \u2013 but that was John,\u201d she said at the time, adding that her years with John in Liverpool were the best of her life. Her wittily illustrated 1978 book about her early life, A Twist of Lennon, was followed in 2005 by a more serious memoir, John. \u201cThe key point for me is that they both fell madly in love when she was 18 and he was 17. It was equal on both sides,\u201d said Howl, 73. \u201cI was in the Cavern Club a lot as a teenager and saw them there. I was in the right place at the right time, so it has always bothered me that no one has looked at Cynthia\u2019s influence before.\u201d While the playwright was researching This Girl, he put out an appeal for people with first-hand memories of Cynthia to come forward. One who responded was Julian Lennon. \u201cHe said he was pleased someone was finally writing about how talented his mother was, since all the world has written about his father and no one has paid her any attention,\u201d said Howl. Cynthia died in Spain in 2015, but Howl tracked down two of her closest friends from Liverpool days. One, designer Helen Anderson, recalled making Lennon\u2019s famous cap. \u201cI was told lots of lovely stories, including how Cynthia went out to Hamburg to visit as a naive teenager,\u201d said Howl. \u201cThe first half of the play is snapshot moments from their lives together, with some original songs. There is a scene in which John is working on the song You\u2019re Gonna Lose that Girl in their home and Cynthia joins him to sing it.\u201d Cynthia kept painting and married three more times. \u201cShe would have been 80 this year, and I feel she must take her place in the Beatles story now,\u201d said Howl. This Girl is on stage from 21-26 August at Liverpool\u2019s Hope Street theatre with additional performances at the Adelphi Hotel"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
