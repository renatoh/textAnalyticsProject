This means draughty winters and phenomenal heating bills. We are considering double-glazing, but might this put off potential buyers if we want to sell up in the future? Yes, if you go for windows not in keeping with your property. Buyers are initially far less preoccupied with heating bills than they are with the attractiveness of their prospective home. Maintaining the period charm of your property can mean the difference between it being highly desirable or virtually unsellable, according the experts. 'Having the wrong windows, such as u-PVC windows in a turn-of-the-century property, can massively deteriorate the value of a house,' says Christopher Bramwell, associate director at estate agents FPDSavills, 'If you put in plastic windows, you are likely to have to either return the windows to their original style, which can cost around \u00a31,000 per window, or you will have to reflect the cost to the next owners of doing this work. Period features are a very important selling point.' The good news is that you need not freeze this winter. There are a number of companies specialising in reproduction windows that offer thermal insulation without compromising the original style of your house, such as The Heritage Window Company on 0800 731 4294, or The Original Box Sash Window Company on 0800 783 4053. But before you invest in new windows, bear in mind that any kind of double-glazing could lead to more than just cosmetic problems. 'Many older houses are meant to be able to breathe. By getting rid of original sash windows, you may experience problems with excess condensation,' warns Sebastian Deckker, director of estate agent Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
