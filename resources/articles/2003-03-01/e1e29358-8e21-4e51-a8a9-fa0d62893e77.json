The David Barron-trained seven-year-old proved a real money-spinner during the winter and ran off a mark of 85 when successful on the Fibresand at Southwell in February. He was bumped up to 95 before finishing second to Peruvian Chief at Wolverhampton earlier this month, but is rated just 59 in this afternoon's Saffie Joseph Handicap. That reflects Massey's inferior form on the turf, but he is no slouch in this sphere and the key to his chance is getting out in front on a sharp track. The Southwell turf circuit is laid out inside the all-weather course and should be ideal for Massey (5.30) , who goes particularly well for today's rider, Dean McKeown. Surprisingly for a horse once tried over 11 furlongs, Massey seems to have got quicker with age. Perhaps connections have simply found out his true requirements. He certainly has plenty going for him today, even from a wide draw. Another recent all-weather winner, Mister Sweets (3.10) , found only Law Breaker too good for him when switched back to turf racing at Doncaster last week. He has good prospects of going one better in the HBLB Handicap. Over the jumps at Carlisle, Waterberg (2.45) looks capable of repeating his win at this corresponding meeting last year. Winner of the novice chase that day, he has found life tough in handicaps this term but with Henry Daly's team in good form the eight-year-old is worth persevering with. Richard Johnson evidently thinks so and travels north to take the ride."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
