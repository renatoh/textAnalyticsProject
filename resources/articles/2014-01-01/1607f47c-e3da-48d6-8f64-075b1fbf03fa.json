This documentary from Beth B looks at something you might call Burlesque 2.0, building on the naughty showgirl personae and retro chic, and taking in performance art and political satire; it's burlesque that looks at body image, sexual identity and cis and transgender issues. But there's a fair bit of narcissism and self-satisfaction here. I'm bound to say burlesque may be something that has to be experienced live, not on screen. Burlesque requires mischief and mystery; somehow this low-cost doc reduces both."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
