But what you find out is what their character is like, what people are really like. Sometimes you can\u2019t find that out in a week or a month, sometimes it takes a full season.\u201d One player scheduled to start at Chelsea is Jordan Pickford. The goalkeeper is much admired but Moyes has cautioned the 23-year-old\u2019s suitors, including Everton, that Pickford will be sold only for a sum in the region of \u00a330m. \u201cIt would need to be a really, really big offer,\u201d said Moyes, who replied yes when asked if that constituted around \u00a330m. \u201cI have said all through the season that sometimes you may have to sell to improve. But I\u2019ve seen some really derisory sort of figures getting mentioned, and it wouldn\u2019t be any of those figures, I can tell you that.\u201d Moyes\u2019s still uncertain future as Sunderland\u2019s manager should be resolved next week when he has a final round of talks with Ellis Short. Those discussions will determine whether the club\u2019s owner agrees to invest the money necessary to implement the Scot\u2019s blueprint for overhauling the squad and challenging for immediate promotion. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it over the next few days,\u201d said Moyes, who seems undeterred by the increasing hostility of Sunderland supporters towards him. Asked if he could envisage a day when the fans stopped booing him and began singing his name, he replied affirmatively. \u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can go to many places where it\u2019s changed. Winning football matches makes a big, big, difference.\u201d One of the reasons why Sunderland have lost so many this season is the disappointing form of the Manchester United loanee winger Adnan Januzaj, who has struggled on Wearside. Moyes, though, has backed Januzaj to earn a new contract at Old Trafford. \u201cAdnan\u2019s our best technical player \u2013 he\u2019ll have a big future,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s found it quite difficult here. We were looking for a bit more from Adnan but he\u2019s a really good talent. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Manchester United took him back and gave him a new contract.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
