Previous to this, and I\u2019ve never admitted this out loud, when people have spoken about their baby\u2019s \u2018personality\u2019, I feel a bit, well, sceptical. Up until now most tracks of my child\u2019s development have been physical, mechanical, intellectual. Rightly or wrongly, I\u2019ve found it harder to track character development because I think of character development as something that comes much later. So when people have referred to their six-month-old as confident, smart, sensitive or whatever, I\u2019ve been classifying these claims with those from people who see the face of the Virgin Mary in a hedge. Or who, like my dad, are adamant their dog has human-level intelligence. By the by, if you ever do meet Sally, my father\u2019s adorably giant dopey golden retriever, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking she has the intellect of a sea sponge. But I\u2019d advise you not to mention that to my dad, since he believes she\u2019s one of the smartest people he knows. I don\u2019t mention this to him. Nor do I mention that Sally eats her own shite and spends 90% of her life begging for belly rubs \u2013 just like I don\u2019t tell fellow parents I find it hard to discern a personality beyond \u2018definitely a baby\u2019. Not that the vast resources of the internet make this any easier. When it comes to \u2018getting to know your child\u2019, parenting websites are an eternal horror. The best ones have stats and markers, but the cheerless, antiseptic blankness with which they chart progress suggests a neatly labelled container filled with fruit flies in a genetics lab. Worse are the thousands of dreamcatcher-friendly dunce hubs, spewing algorithmically programmed pap about wellness, spirit and being true to yourself. As if my main goal in parenting is to be true to myself? Have they not considered \u2013 as I do constantly \u2013 that I might be really bad at this and need to be told exactly what to do? But to my surprise and delight, my son has begun introducing himself to us on his own. We\u2019ve started to note small glimmers of selfhood \u2013 repeating back the games we play with him and, it would seem, trying to make us laugh. I\u2019m not saying we have a Peter Cook on our hands just yet \u2013 his concept of humour is to momentarily hide his face and then reappear, or to ignore our instructions not to sit in the fireplace while looking back at us and laughing. But still. It\u2019s there. As he cackles, we wipe the soot from his blackened hands and marvel that these minor acts of defiance show his naughty, silly self is arriving more and more each day. In terms of personality, he may not be on Sally\u2019s level just yet, but it\u2019s a start.
