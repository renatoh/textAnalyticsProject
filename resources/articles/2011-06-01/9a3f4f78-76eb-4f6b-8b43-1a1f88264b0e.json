But sometimes, during a tricky patch on a difficult pitch, he will repeat the old mantra. It conjures a surreal image as, opening the batting for Somerset on a cloudy summer's day, Trescothick silently sings the words of Eminem's Lose Yourself. \"Look,\" he will hum under his breath, his Somerset accent mangling a skinny white rap from Detroit, \"if you had one shot, or one opportunity/To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment/Would you capture it?\" Trescothick, who lost his career with England to a debilitating mental illness, now captures the moment over and over again. He is so concentrated and determined that, yesterday, playing only his eighth county championship match this season, he had already piled up 1,047 runs at an average of 80.53. He has played one fewer game than his closest challenger, Dale Benkenstein of Durham, but he has scored 187 more runs than anyone else in county cricket this summer. Those statistics would be striking even without the ordeal Trescothick has to face every day of his life. He describes the anxiety that broods within him as \"the beast that lives inside\". And when Trescothick tells me how recently the beast stirred again, inducing the \"shiver\" that grips him just before he confronts the threat of breaking down, the image of a former Test batsman singing the lonely words to an Eminem lyric no longer seems quite as amusing. No song, and no string of words pieced together in his head, can help Trescothick when \"the shiver\" returns with inexplicable force. Then, he feels himself being pulled towards that terrifying vortex which once left him sobbing on the floor of Dixons at Heathrow. Trescothick has long been open and brave in detailing the extent of his past traumas; and yet it is a shock to hear his response after he is asked when last he felt the \"shiver\". \"Last week,\" he says. In the midst of his imposing form, with Trescothick batting as impressively as he ever did in his 76 Tests for England, you might expect the beast within to be muzzled. But his answer is a jolting reminder of how vigilant he needs to remain. \"You still get it at odd times, when you think something is going to happen,\" he says. \"You're always only one step away from it and that's why you need to maintain the good things in your life. \"It happens in strange ways. Last week my phone rang and I felt it then. It's like something comes over you. You pick up the phone and someone says, 'I've got something to say \u2026' And you just \u2026\" Trescothick can't help himself. He literally shivers at the memory of thinking he might collapse again. \"It's just that little moment when you think: 'What are they going to say?' I programme my brain to expect the worst but then \u2026 [Trescothick lets out a big breath] It's OK. You walk away and it's all OK.\" The 35-year-old, a master batsman and an otherwise calm man, avoids any dramatic flourishes to overplay a condition that has shaped his life. Has he had any major relapses, when the shiver refused to slip away, since he wrote his ground-breaking book about depression in 2008? \"At the end of the season before last, when I came back from India a second time,\" Trescothick says, remembering his earlier breakdown in that country in 2006, when his premature departure meant Alastair Cook was hurriedly handed his Test debut. \"That was when I went to the Champions League with Somerset [in October 2009] and had to come home. That took time to get over. That closed everything in the sense of me thinking: 'Right, I'm not going to do that again. I have no ambition to travel abroad any more.' Clearly, it only makes me worse so why should I even put myself in that position? The winter just gone has been great for me, the best since I've really started to struggle with depression, so maybe I'm now taking control.\" But \"the beast\" still lurks inside? \"Clearly,\" Trescothick nods. \"It's not me. It's somebody totally different who takes over. I think it always just lies dormant until the anxiety rises up. It's more an anxiety issue I have, rather than a depression. Of course they're two sides of the same coin but I can flip into anxiety state very quickly \u2013 because my brain doesn't cope well with anxiety. At the same time you learn how to do all the good things so you can say: 'OK, let's get back to normal.'\" Trescothick has done more than anyone in this country to generate an understanding that sportsmen at the peak of their profession can be intensely fallible \u2013 with cricketers being especially prone to psychological distress because of a relentless schedule and the probing questions asked by their sport. \"The response has been huge. I got loads of stuff when I wrote my book and the awareness it provoked was really moving. I've also had letters where someone has said: 'You've saved my wife's life by talking about your condition.' It's hard to comprehend that. Who knows where it takes me in terms of the work I do with depression. But every time I speak about it I see the reaction. We need to try and help people.\" Trescothick's painful experiences, and his willingness to explain them, meant that the return of Michael Yardy from the World Cup in March was treated sympathetically. \"Definitely,\" Trescothick says. \"The difference was also that Yards said what he was suffering with, straightaway, which was a good thing. There's a better understanding of depression \u2013 and there was certainly more acceptance of Yards because the press had dealt with it before and so had the players. It was like everyone, said: 'OK it's like another injury. You just can't see that I've got a bad head in the way you can see I've got a broken foot.'\" Does Trescothick ever grow weary of voicing his thoughts about the beast? \"Not really. I've just got to be careful I don't drag myself too deeply back into it. Constantly talking about it, reminding myself about it, brings back little things. So I've got to choose the right avenue and the right time. But I need to keep doing it for my own self-esteem \u2013 and, also, to keep raising awareness.\" Consequently, Trescothick stresses how the Professional Cricketers' Association, and its Benevolent Fund, helps him and his colleagues on the county circuit. \"When I came back from India and needed counselling the direction from the Benevolent Fund was vital. They've got a counselling system and the day after I got back I was seeing a counsellor \u2013 funded by the PCA and Friends Life.\" Less seriously, Trescothick reveals that, at Somerset, he is called Mad Fish. \"It's great fun because it's not just related to my depression. They think I'm generally just loony.\" The fact that Trescothick and his team-mates can kid around is the surest sign that he is, usually, in control of himself. It also shows the steadiness of temperament that underpinned his 14 Test centuries. But there is an intriguing contrast between a confident professional and a vulnerable human being. How did he curb his enduring anxiety in Test cricket? \"I never saw it as anxiety. It was exciting at that point. It's nervous tension that hits you behind the scenes. But the 'anxiety' you get from playing is a buzz \u2013 it's a shot of adrenaline. It makes me move faster and hit the ball harder. I loved playing for England because it was like I was being shot in the arm with adrenaline \u2013 every time I hit a four I got this huge feeling inside: 'Come on, do that again.'\" He is fascinating in his continuing compulsion, despite his forced retirement from Test cricket, to score runs. Yesterday, in a county championship match against Warwickshire, Trescothick rolled on and for a long time looked on course for his seventh century of the season \u2013 before finally falling for 69. How does he find the adrenaline on a Monday morning against Warwickshire? \"I don't work on adrenaline anymore. It's desire now. You understand there's not going to be 15,000 people watching you. But you reinvent the way you play. And through experience and desire and hard work you chase the same goal \u2013 to be the best.\" When he does sing at the crease is it still, typically, Eminem's Lose Yourself? \"Definitely. I'm so clear on the Eminem lyrics. You repeat the lyrics so that it's more of a focus and you're not just humming. The tune doesn't matter. Even the lyrics don't really have a meaning after a while \u2013 but repeating them helps my brain gets used to the level of concentration I need.\" One memorable line in Lose Yourself insists that: \"Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not.\" Trescothick laughs, the demons running for cover deeper inside himself, as he shows his fierce appetite for success. \"I've never been someone who writes down targets,\" he says. \"I always just want to be the best. I want to score the most runs. I want to score the most hundreds every season. I just know that I want to be No1. I still want to be the best.\" Friends Life is lead sponsor of the PCA Benevolent Fund and Friends Life t20 \u2013 www.facebook.com/FriendsLifet20"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
