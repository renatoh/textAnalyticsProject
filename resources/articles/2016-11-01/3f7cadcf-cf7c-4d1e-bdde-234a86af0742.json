A second judge, James Edelman, has been appointed to the court to fill the vacancy created by Kiefel\u2019s elevation. Confirming the appointments on Tuesday, the prime minister told reporters Kiefel\u2019s story was \u201can inspiration\u201d. \u201cShe left school at 15. She began her working life as a legal secretary. She studied for her completion of high school qualifications part time,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cShe studied law part time through the barristers admission board. She was admitted to the bar in 1975. She went on after practising at the bar to win a master of laws at the University of Cambridge. She took silk in 1987 \u2013 the first woman in Queensland to do so.\u201d \u201cIn 1993 she became the first woman to be appointed a judge of the supreme court of Queensland. She has been one of Australia\u2019s most outstanding judicial officers.\u201d The attorney general, George Brandis, said Kiefel\u2019s career was a study in merit-based advancement, and she would be \u201ca great leader of the court\u201d. The prime minister described Edelman, a 42-year-old Brisbane-based federal court judge, as \u201cquite precocious\u201d and \u201cone of the most outstanding legal minds of his generation\u201d. \u201cHe was born on the 9 January 1974 so he is a different generation to most of the other judges of the high court, but he was a professor of law at Oxford at the age of 34.\u201d Labor welcomed the appointments. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, described both appointments as \u201chighly deserved\u201d on Twitter. In a short statement issued after confirmation of her appointment, Kiefel said she was \u201cdeeply honoured\u201d to lead the institution, and would \u201cwork to uphold the importance of the high court as an institution in our society and to maintain its independence\u201d. \u201cThe high court remains as relevant today to Australians as it did at federation. The issues that come before the high court affect many aspects of the life of the nation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be a privilege to walk in the footsteps of the eminent jurists who have been appointed chief justices since the court was established in 1903.\u201d The Law Council of Australia welcomed the appointments. Its president, Stuart Clark, said Kiefel \u201cwas already a trailblazer for women in the legal profession\u201d before her elevation to chief justice. \u201cJustice Kiefel\u2019s talent and commitment to her profession has taken her to Australia\u2019s highest judicial office,\u201d Clark said in a statement. \u201cJustice Kiefel\u2019s success should serve as an inspiration to all young people considering a career in law.\u201d Clark said Edelman\u2019s professional achievements were \u201cremarkable\u201d given his relative youth. The Law Council also acknowledged the contribution of the outgoing chief justice. French had been \u201can exemplary leader\u201d of the court over the past eight years. The new appointees will be sworn in at the end of January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
