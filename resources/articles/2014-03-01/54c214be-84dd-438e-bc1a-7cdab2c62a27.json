As the premise might suggest, the story unfolds in a hot-pastel world of fantasy where parents practically cheer when their kids come out, the school (represented by Natasha Lyonne) is super-supportive, and no one gets queer-bashed (Harry Potter's Evanna Lynch is on hand as the token bigot, though). And why not? The result is mostly swishy, sweet fun, although admittedly it might have benefitted from a bit of tweaking to fluff up bigger, better, and bitchier one-liners. Nevertheless, there's something cheering about the fact that in 2014 it's possible for a film like this to both exist and get distribution. Brits should feel proud that in this country the film only has a 15 certificate, allowing access for the kind of teens it depicts, whereas in the US, it's earned an R."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
