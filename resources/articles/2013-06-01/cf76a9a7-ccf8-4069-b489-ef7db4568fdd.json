Not the best game for LeBron James but that block/three-pointer assist/basket pretty much put an end to the San Antonio Spurs hopes. Bosh and Wade were more productive tonight, but not enough to give the Heat too much confidence going forward. The Spurs? Well they committed too many turnovers, had a bad night from Tim Duncan and were poor shooters. When the Heat started to pull ahead it felt like a natural correction, the main reason that the Spurs were keeping it close was their success behind the three-point line. Danny Green is not going to have another 5-5 night from downtown. So, the Heat and Spurs have split the first two games and we have a series that will be going at least five games. I'm excited to see what happens in Game 3 on Tuesday night in San Antonio. We'll be covering that here in the Guardian, hopefully you'll join us. Thanks to everybody for following along with Game 2 of the NBA Finals with me tonight, especially all of those who contributed via Twitter of email. Ciao! Well I said the Miami Heat tend to make big time adjustments after an unexpected loss. Safe to say this happened here. Final thoughts coming soon. Shane Battier hits a three-pointer and that will end the scoring here. The Miami Heat have evened up the NBA Finals! Another Cory Joseph shot. Still nothing from Tracy McGrady. This is kinda funny, there is no situation where he is going to score. (Flo Rida is joking around with Joey Crawford. No hard feelings here.) Rashard Lewis makes a layup to push the score over 100. That means the entire Miami audience gets free corn dogs, right? Cory Joseph makes a free throw here because they are still calling fouls for some dumb reason. We're basically on \"Will Tracy McGrady score in a NBA Finals game finally?\" watch. DeJuan Blair and Patty Mills score, but no T-Mac yet. The annoying thing about Joel Anthony is that his name is pronounced Jo-El, which makes him sound like a rogue Kryptonian supervillain. Rashard Lewis, who used to be a useful player until recently, makes a jumper. Rashard Lewis, Norris Cole, Joel Anthony, Shane Battier and James Jones are all in the game for the Miami Heat. So yeah, we're basically done here. Ray Allen makes a jumper, as does Cory Joseph who has made his reappearance as well. Then Miami takes a timeout, Erik Spoelstra might be emptying his bench here as well. Okay, Popovich brings in Tracy McGrady and Patty Mills, and as I have mentioned in my NBA Playoffs preview that basically means that Popovich has waved the white flag here. LeBron James adds to his points total when Ray Allen gets him the pass for a three-pointer. Matt Bonner makes his first appearance of the game, grabbing a McGrady pass and making a jumper. Email from Thomas Jenkins regarding the use of \"Seven Nation Army\" in sports arenas: I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who wants to hack off his own ears every time the Seven Nation Army chant goes up in the stands. It's been all over European soccer ever since it became the unofficial theme tune of Euro 2012. I don't mind the riff so much, nor even the use of it in sporting arenas; it's that they never finish the bloody thing! Every time it goes up I think 'Keep calm, maybe they'll do it right this time'. But no. They never do. They just chant the first half of it over and over again until it bores its way into your consciousness with all the welcome, pleasant effect of that thing that crawls into Chekov's brainspace in The Wrath of Khan. Finish the damn riff people! If you must use it, finish the damn riff! Jack White may be a bit of a hack, but even he realised that nobody, anywhere wants to hear just the first half of that thing over and over again over any sustained period of time. Hearing it done like this has become, for me, something akin to a nice bit of mild torture of an evening whilst watching the sport. Oh dear lord. LeBron James just... what the heck... The San Antonio Spurs call a timeout and let's see if I can do this any justice. LeBron James makes another mammoth block, on Tiago Splitter, gets the ball into Ray Allen's hands for a three-pointer. Next possession? Mike Miller steals the ball from Tony Parker gets it to James and he decides to get it to the basket himself and the place absolutely explodes. Danny Green picks up his fourth foul, and who would have thought that this would be a major concern for San Antonio. Chris Andersen draws the found and makes his two free throws. Then he picks up a The Spurs put the ball in Tony Parker's hands, which is exactly where it should be. Gary Neal gets the ball and the first two Spurs points of the fourth quarter. My advice to San Antonio would be to score some points here. I'm pretty sure if they don't score any points this quarter that it's going to be hard for them to win this game. Unless they've added \"negative points\" to the rulebook. The Heat have been doing all of this during a game where James has been lukewarm. This is frightening. And a LeBron James layup gets the entire crowd up off their feet. The Spurs have to call a timeout and they do. This one is pretty much *this* close to guaranteeing this series goes at least five games. Super Mario Chalmers! God I even hate myself for that one, but yeah, Chalmers makes a jumper to add to the Miami lead. James makes another great pass, this one to Mike Miller who lands another three-pointer. This one is this close to being broken open.. Spurs get the start of the possession. Ginobili makes a ridiculous pass and Leonard fouls. Now what they wanted there. The insanely hot Chalmers misses, Tony Parker unleashes an airball. And there's LeBron James' fourth field goal Tim Duncan: 3-for-13 LeBron James: 3-for-13 Mario Chalmers: 5-for-10 Danny Green: 6-for-6 I don't know either, you guys. Oh god no. The \"Seven Nation Army\" chants. No no no no no. In any case, Mario Chalmers gets three the hard way, making his shot and the free throw. Manu Ginobili's quarter-ending shot attempt goes nowhere and the Spurs will head into the fourth quarter with a double-digit deficit. Tim Duncan makes only one of two free throws, but Leonard gets the rebound and gets it to Parker who hits a beauty of a floater. So much more Spurs momentum to end the quarter because it's Mike Miller's turn to hit a three-pointer with the help of LeBron's passing. Or LeBron James can also be useful when he is making his shots, of course. He makes a thunderous layup. LeBron James gets the ball and makes a wonderful pass to Mario Chalmers who gets it to Ray Allen for a three pointer and boom. See, LeBron James doesn't have to score to be effective. Eric Freeman of Yahoo! Sport's essentiall \"Ball Don't Lie\" blog, summing up basically everything. Mario C. likes to keep it clean, he hits a layup, drawing a foul on the suddenly indispensable Danny Green and he makes the \"and one\" to complete the three point play. Gregg Popovich calls for a timeout. That's a way to break out of a scoring slump, Tim Duncan makes a dunk and Danny Green... only hits a two-pointer. Why is he slacking here? And here come the officials. A three-second violation is called on Tim Duncan and the Spurs, and Mario Chalmers makes the free throw. Chris Bosh, who is having an acceptable game at least, makes a jumper. Crawford gives LeBron a questionable call. And Duncan misses again, it's 2-11. What is going on here? LeBron misses a three-pointer. And we have hit Bizarro world, which means it's time for Bizarro Udonis Haslem to become a key offensive player for Miami by making a jumper. Another Duncan miss. He's now 2-10 just like LeBron James. Oh hey, Kawhi Leonard goes for an old fashioned three point play makes a jumper and gets fouled... but he misses the \"and one\" free throw. Dwyane Wade gets on the line and misses both free throws. Well it's one more foul on Duncan at least. Tony Parker comes back in on the team. See you... maybe never again Cory Joseph. Chris Bosh makes a jumper out of the break, but nobody on the Heat can stop the Spurs from making threes. Kawhi Leonard ties up the game And I take that timeout to remind myself that we've moved on to the third quarter here. This one's going by fast. Just ask the players trying to guard Danny Green. And Kawhi Leonard makes a layup here, he's been having a solid offensive and defensive showing this series. Tim Duncan makes an amazing pass to Tiago Splitter who makes a six-footer. And Danny Green happens. Another three-pointer. Another Heat timeout. Lordy. Danny Green gets called for a foul, and this will put LeBron James on the line. Hey, anything to add to the point total he makes both. And Tony Parker is out of the game now. Huh. LeBron James can't make a layup, Tony Parker takes it on the other end and misses one of his own. Who would have thought that the first part of the sentence would be less surprising at this point of the game. Bosh makes a jumper assisted by Wade. Oof, Haslem hits the ground hard. Sucky birthday that. Tony Parker is awarded a foul on the play and makes one of two free throws. This is fair. Just wait until the series shifts to San Antonio and the Worst Arena DJ In Sports. EVERYBODY DANCE NOW! Danny Green has 12 points, more than any other player on the Spurs or the Heat at the half. Basketball is weird. Well, I still stand by my Heat prediction. If it weren't for the three-point success on San Antonio's part this feels like it could already be out of hand. Can the Spurs make a comeback here? Do the Heat have control over this game? Will LeBron James score more than four points in the second half? We'll use your thoughts here, either email hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt. This feels weird, it reminds me of the games Kobe Bryant occasionally plays where he avoids shooting himself and goes overboard with passing the ball. Except James probably isn't doing it to prove some sort of weird point. And now for a musical interlude via Saturday Night Live... (Note: Don't listen to it for the entire ten minutes, that would lead only to madness.) Parker goes out of bounds with the ball, LeBron passes the ball to Wade who makes a layup. The Spurs struggle to get anything going, ending with a last possession where LeBron James robs Gary Neal and makes a buzzer-beater attempt. It fails, but just overall not a good sign for San Antonio an we have halftime Spurs ball but they can't get anything out of the timeout. Mario Chalmers joins the Three Party. I am sorta in awe of basketball players just because it's quicker for them to actually make a play than it is to write a sentence describing what they're doing. I think that's the main thing I've learned while liveblogging. Oh thank God. A loose ball foul is called on LeBron James and we hit an official timeout. Manu Giobili picks up his third foul, not a good thing that. And then the craziness happens. Ray Allen makes a jumper. Tim Duncan responds with a basket that Dwyane Wade neutralizes with one of his own. Danny Green then hits ANOTHER three-pointer and can someone anyone call a timeout here for my own sake? So, Ray Allen can help with that whole three-point shooting thing as he gets the Heat a le- Oh nevermind, Tony Parker gets the lead back right away with a 6-footer. The Miami Heat are really outplaying the San Antonio Spurs tonight, they're just hitting more three pointers and collecting a few more rebounds. Chalmers collides into Parker to briefly tie the game... But Tony Parker makes a mid-range jumper to get the lead right back. LeBron is not going to let himself get out-scored by the Birdman, so he makes a jumper and Popovich wants a timeout. Chris Andersen makes a dunk to make up for his free throw miss, which will do it, Parker answers with a layup though. It doesn't matter who San Antonio brings out, does it? Ginobili is in the game and immediately hits a three-pointer. He then fouls Andersen who actually misses for the first time since the Clinton administration. But just the first free throw, he makes the second. Biaw goes in for Leonard for San Antonio. Chris Bosh is in for LeBron James for the Heat. Dwyane Wade pops in for Mike Miller. Nice Tiago Splitter block on a Chris Bosh shot. Norris Cole then fouls Tony Parker in the act of shooting. Parker makes both free throws, Manu Ginobili pops in to replace Gary Neal. Maybe Gary Neal is just motivated and angry that he's one of the few players I didn't talk about in my NBA Finals preview? Gary Neal makes another three-pointer and the Miami Heat take a timeout. Yikes, tie game somehow. Gary Neal gets two free throws after being fouled by Mike Miller. Chris Andersen tips in a Cole jumper. Tiago Splitter makes a jumper and now there's some scoring going on here. The Spurs can't get anything going offensively, and Miami are taking advantage. Norris Cole makes a quick basket to take advantage, increasing the Miami lead. LeBron and the Miami B-Squad start the quarter. Norris Cole has the ball, for a bit, Kawhi Leonard steals it away. On the San Antonio side, Chris Andersen gets called for a foul. Joey Crawford vs. Chris Andersen, there is nobody to root for in that battle. Nothing happens for San Antonio here.. On the Miami end, Mike Miller hits his first three of the game for Miami! Apparently LeBron didn't get that \"next game LeBron is going to have to take over more\" memo that all the talking heads were trying to pass him along. It's still a tied-game with him only responsible for two points though, and he's not going to end this game with 8 points, we all know this. LeBron James has remembered that there's a game going on, his 15 foot jumper puts him on the scoreboard and marks the end of scoring for the first quarter. Chris Andersen gets the game and immediately dunks, because it's not possible for him to miss absolutely anything. The Spurs need to answer here at the... Oh, that Kawhi Leonard jumper and a three-pointer from Gary Neal will do that. Gary Neal's parents must be proud. I feel like I keep making excuses for the Miami Heat players and I'm not sure exactly why. Ginobili misses a three-pointer. And speaking of old guys who used to make a lot more of their three-pointers, Ray Allen is in the game. Chris Bosh makes a jumper. And, oh wow, LeBron James makes a massive block on a Tim Duncan laup, but there's a foul on the play. On Bosh. Duncan makes both free throws. The Spurs now have five turnovers and the first quarter isn't over. They had four in the whole game on Thursday. I think the most telling quote from Thursday's post-game was Erik Spoelstra admitting that the Spurs probably left Chris Bosh wide open for that three on purpose. I sincerely think he's more hurt than he has let on. Wade misses a 20-foot jumper, he's clearly hurting here and still getting punishment on the court. Miami's turn to take a timeout. Gary Neal is now in the game, just in case his parents are reading this and he fouls Mario C. in the act of shooting. He makes the first free throw. The Heat bring in Mike Miller to scattered applause, and then Chalmers makes the second to give the Heat a lead. Hey Udonis Haslem goes to the rim, makes the shot and gets fouled by Diaw. Veteran presence, y'all. He knocks down the \"and one\". And Tony Parker does his Tony Parker thing and makes a 10 pointer to extend the San Antonio lead. LeBron has been quiet so far... Ginobili, who has only one speed, zooms in and makes a layup seconds after getting in the game. Dwyane Wade answers with a layup of his own. And yep, everyone is talking about how he was cut twice and spent time in the D-League. Boris Diaw and Manu Ginobili enter the game for the Spurs, but the Heat force a shot clock violation. On the other end, we have Mario Chalmers who makes a three-pointer. Danny Green has been close to automatic in this series so far. This could be a star-making turn for him. He's got the \"hard route to the NBA\" pre-packaged soft-focus puff piece angle that we in the sports media love. Chris Bosh gets a block on a Tiago Splitter shot attempt and San Antonio call a timeout earlier than expected. Maybe Popovich sees something he's not liking here? Tim Duncan only needs three shots to make his first basket here. And another Danny Green three, he's managing one per minute. Perhaps not sustainable. Dwyane Wade gets the ball to Bosh for a dunk though. Leonard gets fouled by Chalmers, that's the first foul on Miami, sorta salvaging something for San Antonio. The Spurs keep the ball and Danny Green makes a three. Dwyane Wade makes a shot on the other end of the floor though. Okay now this is officially on. Chris Bosh starts things off for the Heat with a jumper. They're going to need more of that from him. And San Antonio's Danny Green gets the scoring started with a three-pointer. Spurs get the ball first... and they pick up a traveling call. So much for the lack of turnovers this game. And we're off! Thanks. This should be fun. He'll just write himself in the starting lineup. But I do really like the young singer who does the national anthem for the Miami Heat. I'm not a huge fan in general. I'd rather have them play Radiohead's \"National Anthem\" than the actual national anthem. (Warning: Spoiler alert.) San Antonio Spurs Tony Parker, point guard Danny Green, shooting guard Kawhi Leonard, small forward Tim Duncan, power forward Tiago Splitter, center Miami Heat Mario Chalmers, point guard Dwyane Wade, shooting guard LeBron James, small forward Udonis Haslem, power forward Chris Bosh, center Very true, as good as the Miami Heat are, I can't see them taking 2 out of 3 against the Spurs on the road. In today's \"I didn't really expect to read this headline this morning\" files: the newly retired Jason Kidd is already campaigning for the Brooklyn Nets head coaching job. I'm absolutely all for this just for the added wrinkles it would give the growing rivalry between the Knicks and the Nets. Okay, okay, so I know a lot of you might hesitate to talk with us here at the Guardian but I want to assure you that there's only like a 10-15% chance that you will have to seek asylum in Hong Kong after contributing to this liveblog. I don't even know why I bother doing this anymore since I've gone cold since the Conference Finals began. I can't see the Miami Heat not evening up the series at home tonight, quite honestly. Miami tends to respond well from unexpected losses, of course, all of their losses are unexpected ones. I'm going to go with Miami Heat 101 - San Antonio Spurs - 93. I'll take your predictions here. Who do you think wins tonight? If it's the Miami Heat, what adjustments do you think they need to make? Email hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com or tweet @HunterFelt with your predictions. Just in case you think I was joking about Joey Crawford and his reputation among fans and around the league, here are some of his... odder calls. He also might be the reason that Tim Duncan no longer shows emotion. Considering how great Thursday night's Game 1 was, Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and the Miami Heat has a lot to live up to. After a postseason that has mostly been more fun to watch than well-played (pours one out for the ridiculous glory that was the Golden State Warriors playoff run), the Heat and Spurs played something close to a perfect game on Thursday. Game 1 featured nonstop action, few turnovers and not much time wasted on the free throw line. It was a game where the winning team was going to be the one that made just one more play than the other team. Spurs point guard Tony Parker made that one play with his ridiculous \"how did that beat the shot clock\" game-sealer with five seconds left in regulation. So, the Spurs won Game 1 by a score of 92-88, giving them a one-game lead in this best-of-7 series while also effectively taking away home court advantage from the Miami Heat. Of course, it's all LeBron James's fault (although Chris Bosh has been a target of much second-guessing thanks to his late game missed three pointer). Despite his Game 1 triple-double, and the fact that San Antonio's Kawhi Leonard was playing him perfectly defensively, LeBron is getting the brunt of the criticism about the Heat dropping Game 1 at home in American Airlines Arena. This time around, he's being criticized for not doing enough and getting his teammates too involved. Now if he had scored his usual 30+ points and the team had still lost, chances are he would be criticized for being too selfish. That's what happens when you're the world's best player, for good or ill, it all comes down to you. Ultimately though, the Heat didn't lose Game 1 so much as the Spurs won it. Despite having a week and a half off, the Spurs started off the game by scoring quickly, kept it close when the Heat made their inevitable run to grab the lead and then made plays down to stretch to pull ahead for good late in the fourth quarter. Expect the Heat to make adjustments tonight in Game 2. For whatever it's worth, Miami has not lost back-to-back games since January and this series feels like it's going to be a long one. So this should be a fun and interesting night, even if the NBA has decided that referee Joey Crawford needed to get involved tonight (in other words: expect a lot more whistles tonight than on Thursday and Tim Duncan better not even think of laughing). As always, I can't do this alone, I can always use your questions, comments, predictions and complaints about the officiating, email them to hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt and we'll use them here throughout the game. It's the San Antonio Spurs vs. the Miami Heat at American Airlines Arena. Opening tip is 8:00pm-ish, and I'll pop back here soon with starting lineups, YouTube randomness and sure to be wrong predictions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
