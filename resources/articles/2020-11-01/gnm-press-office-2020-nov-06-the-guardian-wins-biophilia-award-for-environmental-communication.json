The award, which was launched by the BBVA Foundation in 2019 and has an annual prize of \u20ac100,000, recognises the work of professionals and organisations in any country that have contributed exceptionally to improving public understanding and awareness of ecological issues. The evaluation committee commented that the Guardian\u2019s commitment to environmental reporting is \u201ca holistic approach\u201d which \u201cmoves beyond past approaches based on segmentation of problems, to consider the links between environment, biodiversity, energy, economy and human health and well-being in an integrated manner [...] setting new directions in the language and image supporting environmental communication.\u201d Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News and Media said: \u201cWe are thrilled to receive this prestigious award. The global climate crisis is the emergency of our times and we are committed to informing and educating our readers about the impact of global heating. Our team of environment journalists around the world bring expertise and real care to the subjects they deal with, highlighting and explaining vital scientific and societal issues to Guardian readers in a thorough, accessible way. \u201cLast year we updated our style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises affecting us all, and we have also made significant organisational commitments - to reduce our own emissions, and to stop accepting fossil fuel advertising - which resonate deeply with our readers. We are extremely grateful to the BBVA Foundation for this recognition.\u201c More details about the award can be found here."}, "isHosted": false}}}
