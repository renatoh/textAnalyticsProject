Publicising next week's anti-war marches in London and Glasgow, the group also warned of the increasing dangers of a potential US-led war on Iran. Jessica Lange, the actor who is currently performing in London's West End in The Glass Menagerie, called for all coalition troops to leave Iraq. \"George Bush's plan to deploy more troops in Iraq was as immoral and criminal as the initial invasion and occupation,\" she said in a statement. \"The majority of the American people are held hostage by an administration which not only does not represent but arrogantly denies the will of the people.\" Mark Thomas, the comedian, said that it was bizarre that the government appeared to take more notice of a million motorists opposing road pricing in an online petition than of the million who had marched against the Iraq war in February 2003. The novelist China Mi\u00e9ville attacked the \"craven set of backbenchers\" who failed to oppose the war. \"This is a disgrace, they have forgotten who works for whom. This is a march to reclaim democracy.\" Among those attending the gathering or sending messages of support yesterday were the actors Richard Wilson and Timothy West, the designers Katherine Hamnett and Vivienne Westwood, the musician Dave Randall from Faithless, artists David Gentleman and Peter Kennard, the cartoonist Leon Kuhn and the playwright Caryl Churchill. MPs are due to vote next month on the future of Trident, Kate Hudson, chair of the CND, reminded the gathering. She said that more than 120 MPs had already indicated that they would oppose it and she said that opposition to Trident among the general public was increasing daily. The marches will be on February 24 and assemble at noon at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, London, and in George Square in Glasgow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
