Frederick Coolidge, of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, has achieved that dream. His paper appears in the July 1999 issue of the Journal of Clinical Geropsychology. Professor Coolidge used a diagnostic tool of his own invention, called the Coolidge Axis II Inventory. Its main purpose? \"To assess clinical syndromes [listed in] the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, schizophrenia and other psychopathological syndromes.\" Coolidge surveyed his mother and her two sisters, asking them to assess their dead mother's psyche \"vis-a-vis the possibility that she had a personality disorder\". Coolidge explains how the DSM gave them a useful framework for understanding \"Mama\" (the affectionate nickname used for the dead grandmother by everyone in the family). \"According to the DSM, personality disorders may be officially diagnosed when the behaviours interfere with social or occupational functioning. All three siblings were in agreement after the study that Mama's personality did interfere with her relationships with each of them, and there might be unanimous consensus among her eight grandchildren on the same issue.\" The study assessed the degree to which Mama fitted the descriptions of 13 different personality disorders: antisocial, avoidant, borderline, dependent, histrionic, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, passive- aggressive, sadistic, self-defeating, schizoid and schizotypal. Coolidge asked his mother and his aunts \"not to consult with each other as they were filling out the inventories\". Together, yet separately, the now-elderly daughters used Coolidge's criteria to size up their departed Mama. Coolidge writes: \"My mother gave my grandmother three personality disorders: sadistic, antisocial and borderline. My aunt Eleanora also gave her three: self-defeating, paranoid and narcissistic. My aunt Wilhelmina gave her none, but her highest three were obsessive-compulsive, borderline and self-defeating.\" The study contains a caution as to the limits of such scientific endeavour: \"The personality and/or psychopathology of the raters themselves may play a significant role in reliability and accuracy. Future studies may wish to address the extent to which these latter factors influence significant-other ratings.\" Eight years after analysing his grandmother, Coolidge joined two colleagues to apply the same method to a famous figure. Their study, Understanding Madmen: A DSM-IV Assessment of Adolf Hitler, is no mere me-too academic paper. The authors emphasise that their analytical technique is unusual: \"It appears that a posthumous DSM assessment by means of informant ratings has been attempted only once. Coolidge [in his 1999 study] assessed his grandmother's personality traits 10 years after her death by using her three elder daughters (all in their 70s) as informants. He found moderately reliable agreement among the three daughters.\" Thus, in at least the one case on record, psychoanalysing one's dead grandmother has been shown to be useful in understanding Adolf Hitler. \u00b7 Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
