Barclaycard says straightforward applications take about 10 working days from applying to receiving a card. So which should you choose? If you want to make interest-free purchases, Kevin Mountford of comparison site Moneysupermarket.com says the Tesco Clubcard and M&amp;S credit card both offer 15 months at 0%. M&amp;S customers will also be entered into a prize draw every time they use their card before 4 January 2012 to win points worth \u00a310,000 to spend at M&amp;S. Cashback cards are a good alternative as you get back some of your Christmas spending \u2013 but only consider these if you can pay off the outstanding balance straight away. The Capital One World Mastercard offers 5% cashback on purchases worth up to \u00a32,000, up to a maximum of \u00a3100, in the first three months. This is followed by ongoing cashback of up to 1.25%. There is no annual fee, however Capital One warns that this card is exclusively for applicants with a \"perfect\" credit history. This includes being a homeowner and having an income of more than \u00a320,000 a year. If you prefer to shop online, try cashback websites such as Quidco and Topcashback. Altruistic shoppers could opt for a shopping site such as gifttocharity or Froggybank, allowing them to donate cashback to charity. A 0% balance transfer card may be a better idea for those preparing for the Christmas spending hangover. Barclaycard Platinum Visa offers 22 months at 0%, with a 3.2% transfer fee.
