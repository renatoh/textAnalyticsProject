They\u2019ve variously told me their systems are down, that they\u2019ll transfer me to another department that then doesn\u2019t answer, and that I should contact the airline. JS, Douglas, Isle of Man Other readers have shared similar frustrations. Mytrip, part of Etraveli Group, is facing the same challenges as every other booking agent \u2013 an inundation of customers whose trips have been cancelled and a shortage of personnel to deal with them. Its website states that priority is being given to those who were due to fly within six days and that it may take up to eight weeks for those with later departures to receive a refund or new travel date. \u201cWe contact the airlines and then get back to our customers as soon as we receive their reply,\u201d it says. \u201cStaff are working seven-day weeks to help, we are training staff from other departments and trying to get former colleagues to jump in.\u201d Many passengers whose cancelled flights were booked direct through an airline are facing similar obstacles. EasyJet has removed its refund option from its website, obliging those who don\u2019t want to reschedule to join the queue for the helpline. JD of West Hoathly, West Sussex has no use for a rebooking since his cancelled flight was to his late brother\u2019s deathbed. \u201cYou cannot email easyJet and it has suspended its \u2018chat\u2019 facility,\u201d he writes. \u201cEach time you call customer service you get a message telling you to call back later. I understand they are swamped, so why not let people claim online?\u2019\u2019 IM of Rimons, France reckons the reason is \u201ca cynical ploy to force people to book another flight and not refund\u201d. EasyJet argues many airlines are not issuing refunds at all, but ducked the question as to why the online option has been removed. \u201cWe are experiencing higher than average wait times and assure customers that these entitlements will be available long after their cancelled flight has flown,\u201d it says. Ryanair does offer a refund option online but its system collapsed under the strain with readers reporting reservation numbers were not recognised. Ryanair blamed a \u201ctemporary glitch\u201d. SM of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, accepted vouchers from Iberia in lieu of a refund, but when she tried to rebook her family of four on a new date, the system only accepted one voucher per booking. \u201cIberia suggested I book each passenger separately, but as our children are under 11 the system won\u2019t allow that,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe vouchers are only valid for one year, and it\u2019s unlikely that we travel enough this year to get to use all four.\u201d Iberia says it was aware of the issue and was working to amalgamate multiple vouchers into one for family bookings. Jet2 seems to be a rare example of an airline getting it right. \u201cI called customer services as soon as our flight was cancelled and the refund was on my card that afternoon,\u201d writes ME of Harrogate, North Yorkshire. \u201cIf Jet2 can do it, why not the other companies?\u201d Vehicle rental companies appear to be giving better service. \u201cI had booked a hire car through comparison site Zest,\u201d writes AC of Edinburgh. \u201cWhen my flights were cancelled, they refunded my prepaid rental, waiving the admin cancellation charge and giving me a 5% discount code for future rentals.\u201d Most rental firms are also waiving cancellation or amendment fees, although Thrifty is more restrictive and Goldcar is still refusing modifications or cancellations for non-refundable budget bookings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
