The celebrated jazz guitarist's new album The Intercontinentals (Nonesuch, \u00a313.99) is really a world music album, spiked with a few shots of jazz. Frisell became the next big thing some time in the early 1980s, with dates as a sideman (to Mathilde Santing, Mike Gibbs, Gavin Bryars, John Zorn), ECM solo albums and the ultra-heavy Power Tools trio. Over the past decade, a string of personal albums has enabled him to explore music beyond jazz: the almost-country of Nashville; the chamber-jazz Americana of Have a Little Faith; the finger-picking folk-jazz of The Willies. More recently, Frisell has collaborated with performers such as Boubacar Traore, Eliza Carthy and Djelimady Tounkara, and toured with his Intercontinental Quartet, with Malian percussionist Sidiki Camara, Greek multi-instrumentalist Christos Govetas and Brazilian singer and songwriter Vinicius Cantuaria (who will tour with his own band this summer). The new album extends the sound and repertoire of that band, adding Greg Leisz on steel guitars and violinist Jenny Scheinman. Though there is little improvisation, there's still plenty of Frisell's distinctively skewed electric guitar tones, his impeccable timing and phrasing, and his unique way of personalising the slightest phrase or melodic fragment. The album opens with the steady twangathon of Traore before sliding into Good Old People, which shows Frisell at his best: after a brief, dense mesh of guitar noise, the sextet settles into a two-bar sequence of La Bamba-like simplicity, while descending string lines (acoustic, electric and pedal steel guitars, oud and violin) weave around the central pulse provided by Camara's quiet arsenal of calabash, djembe, shaker and cymbals. We Are Everywhere has a hallucinatory quality, a slow melody for violin and wordless vocals. Magic brings the ensemble back to the prairie, with a rolling feel and lead lines swapped between the stringed instruments. The absence of regular bass and drums gives the session an other-worldly feel, plus the vibe you get from a bunch of musicians playing music to each other in a circle. There is an improvisational flair to all the strumming and picking, but no jazz breaks. Frisell writes well, but the best tunes are by others: particularly Procissao (by Gilberto Gil), sung in Portuguese by Cantuaria, with Govetas adding a verse in Greek. Other highlights include Traore's Baba Drame; Cantuaria's lovely Perritos; and Yala, by Govetas, a gritty, gradually evolving trio for guitar, oud and percussion. With 14 tracks totalling 70 minutes, the album is too long, with too many detours, but it deserves a prominent place in the world music racks. And since they now feature Ibrahim Ferrer, Ry Cooder and Manuel Galban, Frisell might as well top the jazz charts as well. Joel Harrison's Free Country (ACT, \u00a313.99) is a collection of US roots and traditional songs given a downtown spin: perhaps Harrison wants to be the new Frisell. The band, including violinist Rob Thomas and drummer Alison Miller, performs traditional songs - such as Wayfaring Stranger and Hell Broke Loose in Georgia - with anxious energy. Pianist Uri Caine (artist in residence at the forthcoming Cheltenham jazz festival) guests on three tunes. Yet the \"free\" of the title is more \"free jazz\" - lots of blowing - than democracy. Will The Circle Be Unbroken by AP Carter - sung by Raz Kennedy - gets a treatment that joins the country and jazz idioms together beautifully. Johnny Cash's Folsom Prison Blues and I Walk the Line work less well - some songs can lose their simple power when messed around with too much. Norah Jones, guesting in her unknown, pre-Grammy days, drops by to croon I Walk the Line and a soporific Tennessee Waltz. Free Country marks Harrison as a guitarist-leader to listen out for, but at 65 minutes, the album is too long, too unproduced, and too miscellaneous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
