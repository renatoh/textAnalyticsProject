Berlin to Ljubljana is a new route for Easyjet and has only been made possible since Slovenia joined the European Union earlier this year. Having travelled here last year using Ryanair to Klagenfurt in Austria, and then a little further by train, I knew that there would be no better place to spend Christmas. The reason? The Christmas lights. No jumping reindeers or waving Santas, just simple lights lining the buildings and bridges, with flickering candles illuminating the hill up to the castle. Plus everything runs as normal on Christmas day - restaurants, bars, and cafes - and the streets are bustling with festivity, a far cry from the shut down and stay at home culture of northern Europe. When my dad and his partner asked for a recommendation on where to spend a white Christmas, I persuaded them to join me for a few days. While they checked into Ljubljana's new and ultra modern Grand Domina hotel, I chose to stay in an old prison recently converted into a hostel. Hostel Celica is the perfect place to meet friendly Slovenes who'll happily tell all about the former prison and how it had been used as a place to silence people who opposed communist rule. We hired a car and pretty much drove through every small village in western Slovenia, including the highest mountain pass in the Julian Alps. Surprisingly for a country so small, Slovenia really does seem to have the best of every part of Europe - an alpine landscape, Mediterranean coast as well as Italian, Austrian and Russian cultural influences. Five carefully planned days was only enough to scratch the surface, but it's now time to leave and visit Belgrade for two days before celebrating New Years Eve in Berlin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
