After being in hospital in Cardiff last week he was transferred to Exeter for specialist surgery on the rib, which was pressing on an artery. Internal bleeding, though, followed and he had three further operations. But his family reported last night that he was making encouraging progress and was expected to be moved from intensive care today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
