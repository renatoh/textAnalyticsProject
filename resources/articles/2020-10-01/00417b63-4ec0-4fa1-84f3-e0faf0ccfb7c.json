The availability of Tierney would be a boost for Mikel Arteta, who said on Thursday he would be \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d if the defender was unable to participate at the Etihad. Tierney was required to quarantine for two weeks from last Tuesday after he was deemed to have been in close contact with Stuart Armstrong, who tested positive for Covid-19, while on Scotland duty. Arsenal argued robustly that Tierney, who subsequently returned negative coronavirus tests and said he had been socially distanced from Armstrong at all times, should be allowed to return to England. Initially their discussions with the Lothian Health Protection Team, the Scottish government and the Scottish FA bore little fruit, but by Friday there was fresh optimism that the situation would be resolved and Tierney is understood to have been positive about his prospects of playing. It is understood Tierney would take a further Covid-19 test on returning to Arsenal and there are also no guarantees he will start the game given he has not trained or played over the past 10 days. The Celtic manager Neil Lennon, who said Arsenal\u2019s medical staff had informed his own club doctors of Tierney\u2019s release, now expects Ryan Christie to receive similar dispensation for Sunday\u2019s Old Firm derby with Rangers if the news is confirmed. Christie was also forced to self-isolate after being identified as a close contact of Tierney. \u201cWe would be very confused and want answers, that Kieran Tierney is allowed to play and Ryan has been refused to play,\u201d Lennon said. Reports in Scotland have suggested Tierney tested positive for Covid-19 two months ago, which could provide him with some level of immunity and may differentiate between the cases. That has not been confirmed, although Arteta did say Arsenal felt confident of Tierney\u2019s release given \u201cthe history of the player and what happened in the last few months with him as well\u201d. As well as assessing Tierney\u2019s match fitness, Arteta must decide whether to plunge Thomas Partey straight into action against a City midfield lacking Kevin De Bruyne. Much is expected of Partey, the \u00a345m deadline day signing from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, but he only arrived at the club on Tuesday after completing 90 minutes for Ghana against Qatar the previous evening. Arteta has no doubt Arsenal have enlisted an elite performer but believes he will, nonetheless, need time to acclimatise. \u201cProbably there is a lot of expectation but we have to always give some time to players to adapt,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Spanish league and the Premier League are completely different, there are some big differences between Atl\u00e9ti\u2019s style of play and ours as well. \u201cWhat is unquestionable is the quality of the player and the level he has been playing in the last five or six years. That obviously will be a big help and if he has the support of the coaching staff, players and fans that I can see, then obviously the adaptation will be quick.\u201d At 27, Partey is a relative rarity in arriving at Arsenal ready-made as a top-grade talent. \u201cWe need a balance between a lot of young players in breakthrough or development phases and others who are at the peak or twilight of their careers,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cWe believe he is the right recruit for us in terms of age, in terms of his history and career, where he has been educated, the amount of experience he has and the quality he has to adapt to our game model.\u201d As expected, Friday came and went without a loan move to the Championship for the centre-back William Saliba. The 19-year-old\u2019s best hope of action appears, in the medium term at least, to be with Arsenal\u2019s Under-23 side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
