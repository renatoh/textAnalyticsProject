History, in other words, will be of little assistance to Gerard Houllier's team, who need to learn more practical lessons, and quickly, if they are to make a serious impact on the Champions League. Last night the black-and-white chequered shirts of Boavista came here prepared for a game of footballing chess, only to find the opposition keener to indulge in the relative simplicities of draughts. A draw in their first encounter with English opponents will have satisfied the Portuguese champions more than it did their hosts. Nor will Borussia Dortmund or Dynamo Kiev, Liverpool's next opponents in the first group phase, be quaking in their boots after this modest evidence of Anfield's Champions League potential. To be sure, Michael Owen responded with a goal of typical panache after Silva had put Boavista ahead in the third minute, but thereafter Liverpool faced mounting difficulty as they vainly sought a winner in the face of obdurate, disciplined defending. Just as Manchester United suffered a succession of disappointments while they assimilated the nuances and knowhow of this tournament, so Houllier's players may require a season or two to get to grips with it. What was not required last night was a somewhat galumphing approach which contrasted poorly with the quick, instinctive movements of Boavista's Brazilian-laden side. Houllier blamed inconsistency, rather than poor play, for his team's moderate performance. And to be fair to Liverpool they found it hard to get a respectable rhythm into their game against opponents who when they were not committing cynical fouls - which brought them seven yellow cards - were writhing in agony after the slightest body contact. Then again, Emile Heskey can be an aggravating thespian at times and in any case Liverpool will have to reaccustom themselves to the tricks of the European trade. It was not so much Boavista's spoiling tactics which frustrated Houllier's players as their own inability to pin down the precise passing and bewildering interchanges of position of players such as Duda and Silva. Stephane Henchoz suffered a particularly trying evening. At times the Swiss defender seemed to be transfixed by his own uncertainty and never more so than when Boavista took the lead. A free-kick was headed on by Silva, then chested down by Alexandre. Silva, meanwhile, had nipped through a static defence to meet the return ball, which he drove high into the net. With Owen, rested until the last half-hour on Saturday, leading the attack from the start Liverpool had looked to resume the sort of normal service his goals had been giving them. Unhappily for Anfield, however, their defence it was that refused to shake off old habits. But for Jerzy Dudek's swift reflexes, Boavista would have scored again midway through the first half. From Sanchez's centre Alexandre produced a strong diving header which the Polish goalkeeper did well to deflect wide. Only one man was likely to come to Liverpool's rescue, and Owen duly obliged a minute before the half-hour. Steven Gerrard's pass caught the Boavista defence square and spreadeagled, leaving Owen to draw Ricardo off his line before curling the ball around the goalkeeper in the manner to which both Liverpool and England are now happily accustomed. After half-time there was less opportunity for Liverpool to exploit Owen's speed. A series of well-struck long shots flew just high or wide, while at the other end Dudek continued to save his defenders from themselves. A draw was just about right in the end and hardly a disaster for Liverpool's chances of reaching the next phase. But their defence needs a crash course in concentration all the same. Liverpool (4-4-2): Dudek; Vignal, Henchoz, Hyypia, Carragher; Murphy (Riise, 71min), Gerrard, Hamann, McAllister; Heskey, Owen. Boavista (4-3-3) Ricardo; Frechaut, Turra, Pedro Emmanuel, Erivan; Petit, Sanchez (Pedro Santos, 59), Glauber; Alexandre Goulart, Duda (Bosingwa, 84), Silva (Serginho, 79).
