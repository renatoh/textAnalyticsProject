(Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?) The perennial question raises its head once again as a result of a remarkable public intervention by the chancellor of the exchequer last week. The background needs some explanation. When Gordon Brown became chancellor in 1997, he gave the Bank of England responsibility for setting interest rates but punished the Old Lady for its sporadically lax supervision of banks over the years: that responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority. Then, hey presto!, along came George Osborne in 2010, and responsibility for banking supervision was restored to the Bank because \u2013 you have guessed it \u2013 the Financial Services Authority was being punished for its lax supervision of the banks. Osborne's other bright idea was to abolish the FSA completely and set up the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as a much-needed watchdog to protect the public from a financial services \"industry\" that has not distinguished itself \u2013 a function that previously also lay with the FSA. But last week the chancellor publicly censured his \"independent\" financial regulator, the FCA, for what the Financial Times neatly summarised as \"its botched disclosure of a market-sensitive probe\", which led to panic selling of shares in insurance companies that might be affected by the said \"probe\". This caused the FT, which to my mind is normally far too friendly towards the chancellor, to censure him in turn. So how independent is the FCA? It may be guarding consumers, but it is in turn being guarded by the chancellor. One should not really be surprised by this. It is a commonplace in Westminster and Whitehall that in Osborne we have a most political chancellor \u2013 indeed, there are some who say, as they used to of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, that it is the chancellor who is effectively the day-to-day prime minister. Why, Osborne sometimes gives the impression that he is on a zero-hours contract with his own department. However, last week was different. The chancellor was popping up all over the place. In addition to his public rebuke to the chairman of the FCA, one day he was in front of the Treasury committee, defending the dubious arithmetic behind his very political budget; another day he was surprising us all by announcing that he was aiming at \"full employment\". Well, it was a surprise until we read the details. For those of us of a certain generation, the days of an economic policy that aimed at full employment seem, and are, decades away. During what are now looked back upon as the golden days of the 1950s, unemployment would be a mere 1-2% of the workforce. Indeed, the great Cambridge economist and colleague of Keynes, Richard Kahn, used to be vicious in his attacks on a certain Professor Frank Paish, of the London School of Economics, for advocating 2.5% as the ideal rate of unemployment consistent with controlling wage inflation. The rate at present is just over 7%. Ever since Mark Carney arrived at the Bank of England and unveiled his policy of what I am tempted to call \"forward misguidance\", the financial markets have been obsessed with when the Bank of England will decide to raise interest rates. Carney has admitted \u2013 he had no alternative \u2013 that unemployment has so far fallen faster than he expected. But he has also gone out of his way to emphasise that he never regarded 7% as the significant level for policy tightening, even if some analysts had got this impression. The Bank regards what it terms \"the medium-term equilibrium rate\" of unemployment as 6-6.5%. The budgetary watchdog, the OBR, judges that \"the long-term structural unemployment rate\" is around 5.25%. The difference seems to be that the Bank fears pressures on wage inflation before many of the long-term unemployed return to work. In classic mandarin, the OBR regards its own and the Bank's assessments as \"broadly consistent\". Last week the governor reiterated that there was \"still slack in the labour market\" and interest rates would not rise until the economy was performing closer to full capacity. It turns out that when the chancellor talks about the goal of \"full employment\" he means that there would be more people in jobs here than in any other G7 country. That strikes me as a pretty fishy definition. Also, he appears to be counting the many people who are now in part-time jobs, or defined as \"self-employed\", in his definition. You see the sleight of hand? He will count partly employed people as one constituent of his \"full employment\" definition. The background briefing, by the way, has it that, in focusing on his eccentric definition of \"full\" employment, the chancellor is attempting to divert attention from his repeated failure to meet his other economic targets, not least those for economic growth and deficit reduction. The OBR is punctilious in charting the course of the chancellor's, and its own, revisions. But we have not yet reached the stage where, as in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the records are routinely altered so that Big Brother's forecasts always turn out to have been right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
