With just six months to go before the UK leaves the EU entirely by exiting the single market and the European customs union, retailers fear further damage to a sector already reeling from the coronavirus crisis, with 5,600 job losses announced on Thursday from Boots and John Lewis alone. In a report on the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the public should be aware that no deal will mean a hike in the prices of not just luxury goods but \u201cordinary household goods that every consumer has to buy and replenish\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not foie gras that we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s mince, it\u2019s cheese, it\u2019s oranges, you know,\u201d said Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium in a Brexit press briefing. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s Great Britain, or it\u2019s Northern Ireland, the people who will suffer most because of these cost rises will be those people who are most economically vulnerable.\u201d The BRC has calculated that beef, which is imported in huge quantities from the Republic of Ireland, will go up in price by 48%, with cheddar cheese, another staple imported from across the Irish Sea, expected to cost 57% more. Oranges from Spain will cost 12% more, while the price of cucumbers will rise by 16%. Trousers imported from Italy will have a 12% levy slapped on them , porcelain kitchenware will also go up by 12% and drinking glasses made in Poland up 10%. Connolly said it was a misunderstanding to think that retailers and their suppliers had built up \u201chuge Brexit war chests\u201d and added that Covid-19 had exposed the fragility of the supply chain. \u201cThe ability and bandwidth, both financially and time-wise, of retailers to deal with a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year has been greatly diminished,\u201d he said. About half of all food consumed from restaurants or shops comes from the EU, with 30% of produce in supermarkets from the bloc. Trade deal talks continued this week in London, with the second face-to-face meeting between negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost. Little was said to suggest that progress had been made and public pronouncements last week suggested they were a long way from a deal. Deal or no deal, the UK is facing a new trading regime from 1 January as the country exits the single market and the customs union, forcing customs and food health checks on goods entering the country. \u201cThat is going to increase a level of friction that we haven\u2019t seen since 1972,\u201d said the BRC trade expert William Bain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
