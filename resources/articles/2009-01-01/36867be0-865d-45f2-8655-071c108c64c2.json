Rachel must be a great pilot. Which of the following can be said about the reasoning above? A) The definition of the terms creates ambiguity B) The argument uses circular reasoning C) The argument uses analogy D) The argument is built upon hidden assumptions E) Is this test really going to show you anything other than the fact I have enough money and/or self-hatred to spend months cramming for a test that indicates nothing other than my wealth and/or self-hating ambition? The above question is from the LSat (I made up one of the options), a three-and-a-half-hour standardised test required for all applicants to American law schools, intended to gauge analytical skills, logical reasoning and reading comprehension. In the law school admission process, the LSat is considered to be of equal weight to your entire undergraduate career \u2013 which seems particularly cruel to American students, whose graduating mark or GPA is a cumulative score where every essay and course they take counts toward their final grade, which is hardly the doss around for three years then cram for eight final exams education I received in the UK. Officially, your undergraduate score, personal essays, references and LSat score will all determine whether or not you're admitted into a law programme, but some prestigious universities reportedly use the LSat as a one-glance mechanism for determining whether to even spend time reading an application. Yet the problems with the LSat are more numerous than the number of options on a standardised test sheet. Not only is it widely considered to be a poor predictor of success, as well as potentially ethnocentric, it increasingly produces a result that the richest students can buy with thousand-dollar tuition programmes, fuelling a billion-dollar test-preparation industry that has no interest in the common good of education. I had to take the test in Tel Aviv earlier this month because it was the closest test centre to my country of residence (test-takers can request a non-listed test site if their country doesn't provide an LSat, but the fees are so exorbitant it's probably cheaper to cross a border to the nearest listed centre). In an unpleasant introduction to the famous lack of social cohesion of graduate school, at the test site young NGO workers based in Palestine made uneasy small-talk with Ivy League-educated alpha-males, all pink polo shirts and preppy hairstyles, who flew in from America on business. As I overhead two of them discussing whether, statistically speaking, option D was the correct answer 1% more often than any other letter, I wondered whether I'd ever be ambitious, rich, obsessive-compulsive or pink-polo-shirted enough to fit in at law school, even if I did get through the next three-and-a-half hours of logic \"games\". The exam itself wasn't too bad \u2013 although I don't get my results until next week, and unlike essay exams, it's difficult to guess your score accurately (having to sit in the exam room for that long seems more of a test of how well your bladder can hold up than anything else). But what's most depressing is that a good score probably means nothing about a person's actual intelligence, other than their ability to learn a certain test format. A 2005 Canadian report (pdf) claimed that although \"the reliability of the LSat has been questioned on numerous occasions, it still is heavily weighted by law schools, who claim it tests law-school required skills\". But law school professors admit that law students will not be asked to answer the same number of questions under the strict time constraints of the LSat, with its back-to-back sections of 35 minutes for every 24-28 questions. Earlier this year the dean of UC-Berkeley's law school sought support for national research on LSat alternatives that measure characteristics central to success as a lawyer, such as negotiating skills and stress management. But an alternative to the LSat wouldn't just benefit all good potential lawyers who mess up the day of the LSat. It would primarily help ethnic minorities and students from poor backgrounds \u2013 socio-economic groups for whom American universities talk a lot of talk, but deliver few results. A 1998 study showed a significant LSat score difference between minority and white students from the same universities with identical GPAs, indicating that this is either because minority students are more likely to be from low-income backgrounds and cannot afford expensive test-preparation materials, or that the test itself is ethnocentric and favours the knowledge (pdf) of students from certain types of backgrounds. Even without these problems in reality, the very concept that the LSat gauges some kind of innate aptitude for logic and analytical reasoning seems bogus. Aside from the larger question of whether test-assessed knowledge can ever really be innate, the basic fact is that test-preparation companies guaranteeing higher scores \"or your money back\" would not be booming if the notion that you can't prepare for the LSat was in any way true. But despite all the problems with the test's reliability as a performance predictor, more than a few have a vested interest in law school admissions' continued emphasis on the LSat. Companies such as Kaplan - owned by the Washington Post company - and The Princeton Review aggressively advertise their courses on most US and Canadian campuses, offering classes and private tuition for sums that can enter several thousand dollars. Making several billion dollars a year, Kaplan has a near-monopoly on this market, and the company recently settled out of court on accusations of anti-trust collusion with competitors between 1997 and 2006. As a student writer at The Cornell Daily Sun recently wrote: \"With no scholarships available for a test prep course and no financial aid, it's basically so that those who can afford it get a 'leg up' over those who have earmarked their pennies to pay for pasta. Is this the modern day version of daddy pulling out his chequebook to get you into college?\" The test-preparation industry locks the LSat into a negative cycle: The more successful Kaplan is, the more students will likely feel the need to take test-preparation classes in order to compete with their peers, leaving those who simply can't afford them in an even worse position. And yet little of this seems to register in the public attitude to the LSat. In Legally Blonde, heroine Elle Woods crams for the exam in a single, upbeat montage. The obsession with finding out Barack Obama's LSat score can be added to list of internet-driven nut-job conspiracies that the president-elect has faked everything from his birth certificate to his law degree. Perhaps more interesting is the recent blogosphere griping that writer Elizabeth Wurtzel didn't deserve her place at Yale Law because her LSat score was below average for the school. Given that Wurtzel, for all her faults, is a bestselling author and award-winning journalist, it seems odd that people think Yale should have judged her for her LSat \u2013 a supposed indicator of success \u2013 more than, well, her actual success. Such is the problem with the standardised tests. As long as they continue to matter to other people, you have to play the game too. There's little to gain from fighting against them \u2013 or refusing to study for them \u2013 when there are so many other applicants who are willing to spend thousands of dollars on test preparation. During an economic downturn such as this, applications to grad school typically rise, as recent graduates either decide to wait out the recession in academic institutions, or fear for their job prospects if they don't acquire new qualifications. American law school is also an increasingly attractive option for many British students. In the international humanitarian and NGO community for instance, an American JD is often more respected than the myriad qualifications that British students can claim qualifies them in law. And while obviously almost no one, myself included, could ever afford the fees \u2013 which for the top 20 schools can reach $150,000 there are also more funding and scholarship opportunities than in the UK, as rich alumni, charity-donation incentives and extensive investments mean American universities are far less strapped for cash than their British counterparts, at least for now. The test industry and the problems of the LSat as a predictor of success undoubtedly mean we'd be better off if law schools placed less emphasis on a student's performance on the standardised test. But I'm beginning to wonder whether, given its many faults and the nefarious practices it encourages, the LSat is intended primarily to teach prospective law students a valuable lesson in respect to their future career: Life's unfair, so just try to select the best out of a bunch of bad options."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
