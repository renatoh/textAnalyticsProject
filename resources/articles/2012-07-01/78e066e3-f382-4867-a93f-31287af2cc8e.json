Thus began Lady Hale, the only woman justice of the supreme court, in a typically forthright speech defending legal aid. Hale is one of three senior judges on the shortlist for the president of the supreme court. In this country there are no US-style public hearings for judges, a principle we support. Privacy has its drawbacks, in this case the possibility that the court could turn into a self-replicating hierarchy of white males. Hale's route into the judiciary was unconventional. A former law lecturer at Manchester University, she is the only top judge to have been appointed straight from academia. She is open and unpompous. At the last AGM of Liberty, she said she would like the public to think of the supreme court as the guardian of the law on their behalf. She would make an ideal president."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
