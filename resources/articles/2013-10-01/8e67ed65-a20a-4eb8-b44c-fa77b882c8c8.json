This new album contains 10 sublime reflections on religious sites and buildings. If it just represented diplomatic awe around holy places, it could have ended up as spiritually upmarket mood music, but Henriksen's real priorities are the untapped sonic possibilities of the trumpet, as well as ideology-free meditation. On the elegaic Adhan, he cultivates an evocative unsteadiness that makes him sound creatively buffeted by solitude, but he's harder and more incisive (as if peering from the prow of a craft on a foaming sea) on Saraswati, sad but passionate on Le Cimitiere Marin, close to the vocal purity of a chorister on Lament, and in league with the Miles Davis of Sketches of Spain on the softly pealing Bayon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
