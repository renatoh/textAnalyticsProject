Glasgow\u2019s impatient crowd erupts with noise before she\u2019s even visible. A dizzying recap of Aguilera\u2019s 20-year career, the X Tour is her first visit to the UK in well over a decade. Such is her legend that two buskers are competing to cover her classics in the walkway to the arena, pandering to punters who shriek with delight. The X Tour throws together her biggest hits in a series of randomly themed, over-produced acts, with costume changes, unholy guitar solos and video footage punchier than a Marvel fight scene. Presumably adapted from Aguilera\u2019s Vegas residency, this dazzling spectacle feels almost like a one-woman variety show, were it not for the eight dancers, three singers, full band and mountain of glitter. Everything is supersized, but nothing more so than her voice. Aguilera can switch from breezy ad-lib to finger-waving, earpiece-tapping devastation in a split-second. Genuinely jaw-dropping, her vocals are so rich and powerful that she cuts through all the chaos \u2013 of which there is a lot. Seemingly ordered by a Magic 8 Ball, the setlist delivers incredible moments. A fiery, gold-themed one combines Dirrty \u2013 the stickiest, sweatiest dancefloor hit ever written \u2013 with Vanity, a \u201cbadass bitch\u201d mantra from fan-favourite album Bionic, Express, a showgirl extravaganza replete with lots of spanking from the Burlesque soundtrack, and the heart-stopping roar of Lady Marmalade. Throughout, Aguilera prances like a prize pony in golden lam\u00e9 ass-less chaps, sticking out her tongue and winking at fans to get them to scream even louder. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t quite work. A strangely sped-up, abbreviated version of her 1999 hit Genie in a Bottle comes with an improbable but well-received call to arms: \u201cWhere my genies at?\u201d she demands, before segueing into The Voice Within, the most heart-wrenching ballad of the night. The tour, which is ostensibly to promote Aguilera\u2019s 2018 album Liberation, dedicates a full 10 minutes to Sick of Sittin\u2019, a frustrated foot-stomper that flourishes with an arena-rock staging, and Maria, a Kanye West-produced gospel track that turns into a full-band jam session led by Aguilera dressed as the Virgin Mary. But it\u2019s her 2002 album Stripped that hogs the spotlight. The album flipped the good-girl-gone-bad narrative expected of American sweethearts and \u2013 in pleather and motorbike oil \u2013 doubled down on vigorous, visceral emotional and sexual emancipation. It is a reminder that Aguilera\u2019s persistent call for a feminist uprising is far from a shtick \u2013 it\u2019s a 15-year crusade. Tonight Aguilera seems closer to Cher\u2019s cabaret matriarch than the ingenue performer she played opposite her elder peer in Burlesque. She takes a step back during some of her older songs to watch over proceedings, encouraging her backing singers to hit big solos and hugging them when they do. It\u2019s only during her solo rendition of Beautiful \u2013 a self-love ballad to conquer them all \u2013 that she seems to drop the ball. She over-delivers, complicating the vocals so much so that Glasgow\u2019s audience, desperate to sing along, are left in the dust. She looks visibly relieved when the gear shifts into closer Fighter \u2013 \u201cour theme song!\u201d she yells \u2013 for an almighty, gladiatorial victory lap. The aesthetic this time is bondage-Star Trek and the mood is triumphant. Christina Aguilera never has, and never will, do things by halves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
