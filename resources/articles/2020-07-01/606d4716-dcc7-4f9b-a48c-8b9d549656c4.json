Lampard refused to back down on Friday, accusing Liverpool of breaking a code of respect on the touchline. Although Chelsea\u2019s manager said he regretted using bad language after footage showed him repeatedly telling Klopp and his coaching staff to \u201cfuck off\u201d, he maintains that Liverpool\u2019s bench \u201ccrossed the line\u201d and disrespected him with their behaviour on Wednesday. The row was sparked after Lampard lost his cool when Mateo Kovacic was penalised for the free-kick that led to Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s goal and Pepijn Lijnders, Liverpool\u2019s assistant manager, leapt from the dugout demanding punishment. The former Chelsea midfielder\u2019s ire was mainly directed at Lijnders, with the pair also exchanging words in a post-match clinch, and after the game he warned Liverpool not to become too arrogant after winning the Premier League. \u201cYou cannot hit me with something like that \u2013 or my bench with something like that \u2013 because we are not arrogant,\u201d Klopp said on Friday. \u201cFrank was in a really competitive mood and I respect that a lot. You can pretty much, from my point of view, say what you want in a situation like that. For me, it\u2019s after the game. It\u2019s completely over. I have said a lot in the past because it is pure emotion. He came here to win the game or get a point to make sure of Champions League qualification. I respect that a lot. \u201cBut what he has to learn is to finish it with the final whistle and he didn\u2019t do that. Speaking after it like this is not OK. Frank has to learn. He has a lot of time to learn, he is a young coach. But he has to learn. During a game words are used \u2013 no problem at all. But at the final whistle, all the things he said \u2026 we are not arrogant. We are pretty much the opposite of arrogant in a moment like this.\u201d Yet Lampard was unrepentant before Chelsea attempt to secure Champions League qualification when they host Wolves on Sunday, appearing to single out Lijnders when he discussed the incident. \u201cI think arrogance is a very important quality in terms of how you attack football as a player, in terms of how you attack a football match as a manager,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cYou will be full of expectations around you. If you don\u2019t have a level of arrogance, you can be affected negatively. \u201cWhat I think also when you talk about arrogance is respect. When you are in a role at a club or whether you are talking about how benches work my feeling was the bench at Liverpool, or one person in particular, was absolutely crossing that line so that became arrogant to me. \u201cWhat is the code? Lots of managers will call for decisions and it may be right or wrong. Then you speak with each other. But when people on the bench jump up and want to speak across to myself and then smirk and smile and then continue to do so for quite a while, I think that is past the code.\u201d Lampard, who said his problem was not with Klopp, was asked whether the incident demonstrated his tough side. \u201cI do have an edge. I would not have been able to play for Chelsea for so long in a team that was fighting for Premier League or Champions League winners.\u201d Chelsea need to draw with Wolves to guarantee a top-four finish and Lampard, who questioned his side\u2019s attitude after their recent defeat by Sheffield United, wants intensity. \u201cI can\u2019t demand an edge from my players after Sheffield United and not have that in myself,\u201d he said. Dejan Lovren\u2019s six-year career with Liverpool appears to be drawing to an end with the defender close to joining Zenit St Petersburg for \u20ac12m (\u00a310.9m)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
