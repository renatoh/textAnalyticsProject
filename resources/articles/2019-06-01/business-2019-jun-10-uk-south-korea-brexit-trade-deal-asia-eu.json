The two countries have agreed in principle a free trade agreement that will allow businesses to continue trading freely after Brexit, including in a no-deal scenario. The development comes as ministers attempt to secure post-Brexit deals to retain trading rights on preferential terms with countries the UK already benefits from an agreement with under EU membership. Liam Fox\u2019s international trade department has signed continuity deals with nations accounting for about 63% of trade covered by EU deals, including Switzerland, Chile and the Faroe Isles, up from 28% three months ago. However, critics warn that the deals may not cover as much trade as existing arrangements and are incomplete. The deal with South Korea, which Fox\u2019s department said would be subject to final checks before it is formally signed, is the UK\u2019s first major trade deal in Asia since the June 2016 Brexit vote. The Department for International Trade said the agreement would allow UK firms to continue trading on preferential terms with the Asian nation. In 2018, 99% of British exports to South Korea were eligible to be exported tariff free. Fox signed the joint statement in Seoul on Monday with the South Korean trade minister, Yoo Myung-hee. In a statement, Fox said: \u201cThe value of trade between the UK and Korea has more than doubled since the EU-Korea agreement was applied in 2011. Providing continuity in our trading relationship will allow businesses in the UK and Korea to keep trading without any additional barriers, which will help us further increase trade in the years ahead. \u201cAs we face growing global economic headwinds, our strong trading relationship will be crucial in driving economic growth and supporting jobs throughout the UK and Korea.\u201d Trade between the two countries was worth \u00a314.6bn last year and has increased by an average of 12% a year since the EU signed a free trade agreement with South Korea in 2011. UK exports to South Korea have increased by an average of 18% a year since 2011. British cars are particularly in demand, with exports up by a third to \u00a3943m in 2018. Businesses including the drinks company Diageo and the law firm Clifford Chance welcomed the agreement, as did the Scotch Whisky Association. The latter said South Korea was an important market for Scotch whisky, worth \u00a370m in shipments last year. Fox tweeted: \u201cThis means that whatever happens with Brexit, there will be total continuity in trade between our two countries and the basis for an ambitious future free trade agreement when we leave the EU.\u201d As part of its preparations for Brexit, the UK has also signed trade agreements with a group of Caribbean countries, the Eastern and Southern Africa trade bloc, Iceland, Israel and Norway, as well as several smaller countries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
