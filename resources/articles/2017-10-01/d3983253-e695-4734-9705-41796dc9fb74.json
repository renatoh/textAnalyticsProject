After all it was barely an hour since he had rasped in a glorious winning goal for the current league leaders at the reigning champions and, back in the stadium\u2019s media room, Pep Guardiola was still busy lauding the Belgian\u2019s natural talent and eager work rate, declaring him one of the team\u2019s \u201ccaptains\u201d who can \u201cdo absolutely everything\u201d. Yet there had to be some mention of that stunted spell as a Chelsea player, a period that yielded as many loans away as Premier League starts \u2013 two \u2013 before a sale to Wolfsburg in 2014 from which he has never looked back. The sight of De Bruyne dictating occasions such as that on Saturday will always prompt thoughts of what might have been in a corner of south-west London. \u201cBut I\u2019ve no regrets over anything that happened,\u201d the playmaker said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have regrets: they\u2019ve won two league titles since I\u2019ve been gone, so they\u2019ve done fairly well. That\u2019s the way it goes, it\u2019s a business. At that point it was a good decision for me to go and maybe for them it was also good to let me go. There\u2019s no bad feeling at all. It\u2019s just part of life and you need to grow up.\u201d The 26-year-old did that back in Germany and is flourishing on his second coming to this division. There is arguably no more complete player in the Premier League at present, a midfielder with vision and drive, touch and energy, invention and industry. It had been the Belgian who collected from Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, exchanged passes with Gabriel Jesus and, with this contest still on edge for all Manchester City\u2019s dominance of the ball, wriggled into space before ripping that shot across Thibaut Courtois from the edge of the penalty area with his \u2018weaker\u2019 left foot. It was his first goal at Stamford Bridge and a reward that stated his team\u2019s renewed intent this term. Last year they had succumbed in this arena, as well as at White Hart Lane and Anfield. De Bruyne had missed an open goal against Chelsea back at the Etihad, a chance that, if taken, would have put the hosts 2-0 up in a match eventually surrendered 3-1. However, this year, with players better schooled in Guardiola\u2019s high-energy press and brave enough to impose that game plan even on trips to the more daunting opponents, they look a different proposition. \u201cIt\u2019s the way we started to play last year but, obviously, you get some growing pains,\u201d De Bruyne said. \u201cIf somebody makes a mistake, then it looks a little bit silly but it takes hard work. Don\u2019t think it comes easy. It can be more difficult to do the pressing against [lesser] teams because you know they\u2019re going to play the long balls, so the pressing has to be different and you have to manage the space.\u201d They coped impressively with Chelsea this time, for all that their hosts \u2013 perhaps jaded by midweek exertions at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u2013 were too timid in their own approach. This was possibly one of those rare occasions where Antonio Conte misread a situation or felt restricted in the options available to him. Yet the decisions to use C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta at right wing-back and to replace the hamstrung \u00c1lvaro Morata with Willian rather than Michy Batshuayi, seemed uncharacteristically tentative, almost negative. It was N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 who mustered the most touches as an opponent in City\u2019s penalty area, which smacked of a slightly awkward balance in a team built more to contain. City\u2019s reputation precedes them these days \u2013 as it probably should, given the manner in which they have overrun opponents this term \u2013 but the champions needed to take the initiative. \u201cLet me give us credit for what we have done,\u201d Guardiola said when asked if he was pleased that even a team as imposing as Chelsea had clearly been unnerved at the prospect of taking on his charges. \u201cWe did many, many good things. Every manager in the world has a plan and when it comes off \u2013 when it works the way we want them to play \u2013 well, that is why we are here.\u201d This result sent out a message. City are intent on finishing this campaign without regrets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
