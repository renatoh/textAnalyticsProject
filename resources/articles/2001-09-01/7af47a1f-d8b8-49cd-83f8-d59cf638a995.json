Happily, we can; sadly, there are no good ones, just the limp recycled stuff about did you know she had dandruff cos they found her head and shoulders ha ha, a gag I first remember hearing around the time of the assassination of Lord Mountbatten and not even finding it funny then (and not just because I hadn't, in 1979, even heard of Diana). Friday was the fourth anniversary of her death and hardly anyone mentioned it. A man dressed as a clown wept outside the gates of Kensington Palace. A man called John Casey wrote a commemorative article in the Mail which featured a Victorian poem with the last line 'and now peace laps her round' and which was, altogether, an interesting journalistic landmark in that it inspired true physical sensation on the part of the reader, that sensation being one of owning rectal polyps. Generally, however, we ignored it, and of course the jokes can be told. But since when? A year after her death? A month? Who decides? Four years ago this weekend, in the Mrs Blair's Diary slot in this paper, I wrote a limp gag about Di: if her IQ was five points lower they'd have to water her. That night, she died. The line ran unchanged for all editions, on the morning of her death, thanks to a highly complex and technical news-paper-world slip-up known as the night editor being a moron. Three hundred letters of hate came in over the next few days, terrifying in their venom. There were a few who accused me of being patronising - they, of course, got a nice letter back saying: 'Was I being patronising? How clever of you to notice' - but mainly they just said I was 'sick' and should be put on trial, or in stocks, or have my intestines pecked out by crazed feral beaked dwarves in tutus. And I've made Di gags since, and had done so before, and never a sniff, so timing is all. For instance: when can we start telling Queen Mum jokes? Now? A week after she dies? A year? Who decides? Tony Blair? At the moment, we can't even read the book about her, Kitty Kelley's The Royals , which remains available only in America. For all we know, Kelley reveals that the Queen Mum died 20 years ago and has been played ever since by a very un-dead Les Dawson. We will be able to read it here after she dies, apparently. And, after that day - probably about three weeks afterwards, according to convention - we can make the jokes. And, in fact, it's not just a question of timing: taste comes into it, too. The dandruff-type gags, the ones which aren't funny, can be made earlier: we'll need to wait a little longer for the true laugh, the truly sick. And where does that line lie; who decides when something is too sick? A couple of years back, I was preparing to interview Jerry Sadowitz, not a man famously fettered by taste (he opened a concert in the late Eighties, in front of a monstrously liberal crowd, with the words 'Nelson Mandela: what a clunt', except without one of the letters in the last word). The night before, I asked colleagues in the pub for the sickest joke they'd ever heard. We laughed away until one of our sports writers came up with his own favourite, and a pub full of cynical journalists was reduced to a silence - and this was a pub which, on hearing the news of the death of Mother Teresa, had cheered. So if you ever come across Kevin Mitchell, get him to tell you the one that begins: 'There was this paedophile, right...'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
