Despite this medical truth, TI recently told the podcast Ladies Like Us of how he talks to his daughter about sex: \u201cNot only have we had the conversation, we have yearly trips to the gynaecologist to check her hymen. Yes, I go with her \u2026 I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.\u201d For many centuries, a woman\u2019s virginity was seen as her most valuable commodity, and preserving it her most important mission. Because a woman\u2019s virginity was so valuable to men, people felt they needed a way of proving it. So, long ago, some bright spark decided that a random bit of tissue that sits just inside the entrance to a woman\u2019s vagina would act as proof that his daughter was definitely a virgin. This idea spread far and wide \u2013 so much so that many cultures have an ancient tradition of holding up the bedsheet of a newly married couple to show the wife\u2019s blood, to \u201cprove\u201d she was a virgin. In medieval times there was even advice about how to fake this blood if you weren\u2019t a virgin. It involved leeches, obviously. What most people don\u2019t know is that the hymen has a hole in it \u2013 how else would substances like period blood come out? Another little-known fact is that this hole is stretchy enough to fit a whole penis through. And if you do break your hymen, it heals, just like every other flap of tissue in your body. Many women, of course, do bleed during their first time, and think this is because they\u2019ve broken their hymen. But in reality, this bleeding is usually caused by friction burns \u2013 for a number of reasons, many women aren\u2019t wet enough for comfortable penetration on their first time, so they bleed from friction. This isn\u2019t new information: scientists have been refuting the use of the hymen as proof of virginity for a long time. For these reasons, any doctor who actually agrees to carry out one of these tests is putting someone else through an uncomfortable, completely inconclusive and highly unnecessary medical procedure. The World Health Organization agrees, stating last year that not only are these tests pointless and prove nothing, but are also a \u201cpainful, humiliating and traumatic practice\u201d. Fathers like TI might argue that they are only doing it because they love their daughters, because they don\u2019t think their daughters are ready for sex before the age of 18, and that they are trying to protect them. But if TI does want to make sure his daughter has a happy sex life, he\u2019s doing a few things wrong. What girls and all young people need to hear is that virginity is a heteronormative, patriarchal and unscientific social construct, not a physical thing between your legs. If there is such a thing as virginity, then you arguably have many \u201cvirginities\u201d: your first kiss, your first wank, your first hand job \u2013 all of these virginities can be as important or exciting as the first time you are vaginially penetrated by a penis, if that is something you ever choose to do. Sex can and should be amazingly fun, not something to fear. Of course parents should warn young people that sex can end in pregnancy, unwanted infections, heartbreak and emotional pain. But they shouldn\u2019t tell them to expect physical pain from sex, that vaginas are sacred things with a limited amount of entry tickets. The act of sex can result in the highest pleasure, and respect, consent and communication should be prioritised over abstinence, or the arbitrary number of people you do it with. We can\u2019t protect our children from everything, but we can empower them to know their own wants and needs, so they can figure out when they are ready to have sex. I hope future generations don\u2019t see \u201closing their virginity\u201d as a precious commodity, but rather just another one of life\u2019s great pleasures. \u2022 Flo Perry is the author of How to Have Feminist Sex, published by Particular Books"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
