Entirely the sort of public-spirited contribution one might expect. And a bouquet \u2013 entirely the right reward, as we are reminded by the writer Solomon Hughes that JTI facilitated quality time for a string of MPs at the Chelsea Flower Show. Tories Edward Garnier and Nigel Adams we mentioned here. But also smiled upon were Tories Dame Angela Watkinson, Oliver Colvile, Alec Shelbrooke and Labour's Lindsay Hoyle. Two tickets each for that group on 22 May, each pair worth \u00a31,260. All tastes catered for, as the following month JTI gave tickets for the opera at Glyndebourne to Labour's Gerald Kaufman, Jim Dowd and Tory Bob Walter. They received two tickets worth more than \u00a31,200 for 13 June. Seemed a good idea at the time. And now? Not so much, perhaps. \u2022 With politicians working hard to seem amiable, it's refreshing to be reminded that they rarely leave home without the iron fist within that velvet glove. That realisation must be dawning on that horrible controversialist Claire Khaw \u2013 who was expelled from the Tory party earlier this year when party bosses discovered nasty things she had previously said about the disabled. You are not our type, the Tories said. Which seemed fair enough. But Khaw, being Khaw, went to the high court and applied for judicial review. Cue a letter from the Tory party lawyers \u2013 and it's a beauty. We \"strongly advise\" that you take legal advice \"before taking any further steps\", it says. \"Your application for judicial review will fail.\" You can't challenge our disciplinary committee because we are essentially a \"private members'\" association. Even if you could, the decision was a sound one. We have to respond to your application by 22 July, they say. We will fight and we will win, and make you be liable for costs. \"You have a choice. Withdraw your claim and prove that you have done so by 1200hrs on Thursday 18th July. If you do this our client will not seek to recover its legal costs from you.\" If you don't, on your own head be it. No surrender, says Khaw. I'd rather risk legal fees, if they are reasonable. Reasonable legal fees? She is odd, isn't she? \u2022 After Ed Miliband's advocacy of a US-style primary for choosing his party's London mayoral candidate, we have been wondering who might benefit. Yesterday we mused on the possibilities for David Lammy, Sadiq Khan, Tessa Jowell and, who knows, a rising from the political grave by Ken Livingstone. But the field is wide open, for that is the point of a primary. One running the rule, we hear, is the public accounts committee chair Margaret Hodge, much loved by the public right now for her ruthless pursuit of tax avoiders and shameless bankers. There's a thought to cheer the fat cats in the City. \u2022 To the Spectator, where Rod Liddle pens a short celebration of the rituals of loyalism in Northern Ireland. Why restrict them to Northern Ireland, he says. \"Is there no enterprising alliance over here which might do something similar to celebrate the glorious military success of King William of Orange? One looks in despair at the Church of England, which would almost certainly cavil at such a celebration \u2013 but perhaps some of our more Presbyterian churches might set something up?\" The photo accompanying his piece shows a giant bonfire. Near the top, an Irish tricolour bearing the letters KAT. That's Kill All Taigs \u2013 that is, Catholics. The modern CoE would indeed steer clear. \u2022 Finally, fans of the US comedian Steve Martin will know of his 1984 romantic comedy, The Lonely Guy. It told of a greetings-card writer who authors a bestseller \u2013 A Guide for the Lonely Guy \u2013 and finds that there are millions just like him. Until recently, David Cameron had his own version of the lonely guy. Richard Balfe was the Conservative party's trades union envoy, deployed to woo them away from Labour. But one can only bear so much solitude, and last October, after four years, Balfe stepped down. Since then, all seems quiet on the envoy front. Who wants to be lonely?
