HMRC won a legal battle last month which resulted in 300 banks being obliged to hand over details of offshore accounts to tax inspectors. Now the offshore accounts belonging to managers and middlemen will be specifically targeted by the taxman. Rather than accessing accounts at random, HMRC conducts a risk analysis of all professions and individuals, with those involved in the multi-million-pound football-transfer industry particularly falling under the spotlight. Previous suspicions of a \"bung\" culture prompted police to investigate a number of transfers. That investigation, seeking to issue a strong deterrent message, has since been handed over to HMRC and is still ongoing. But HMRC's principal concern under the new regime is the recovery of unpaid taxes, and past bung-takers might have an opportunity to come clean. Confessing to having squirrelled the proceeds of transfers in offshore jurisdictions will lead to a requirement to repay up to 20 years in back taxes, with interest and penalties of up to 20%. But those found to have deliberately avoided paying their dues are required to repay the back tax, plus interest and a penalty of up to 100% of what has been evaded. The most serious offenders uncovered by the HMRC's new powers can face potential custodial sentences for false accounting. Spurs keep Pompey habit Executives of rival Premier League clubs have privately voiced suspicions that notwithstanding the former Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp being in charge at Tottenham, there is more to the two clubs' relationship than meets the eye. No one has made a formal complaint and no one has any proof of collusion. But the dizzying amount of transfer activity between the clubs this summer, which has seen Peter Crouch and Niko Kranjcar swap sides with Kevin-Prince Boateng and Jamie O'Hara, will give them more to talk about. Those transfers continued a trend of at least one player swapping one for the other in each of the past three seasons. Other expected deals, such as David James to Spurs, fell through, but there was dialogue between the clubs. The deals are reported to be worth a combined \u00a315m but only Spurs and Pompey know precisely their value \u2013 although any cash that has changed hands will have passed through the Football Association. Any supposed mutually beneficial links are unlikely to have been affected by Sulaiman al\u2011Fahim's recent takeover: the former owner, Alexandre Gaydamak, and the chief executive, Peter Storrie, remain on the Fratton Park board. Sack might help the stats Now that the transfer window is out of the way it is managerial rather than playing personnel clubs struggling for results will look to change. Chairmen may be galvanised into action by the findings of a report by the International Center for Sport Studies in Switzerland. It found a clear link between sackings and an upturn in results. \"New arrivals gained, on average, 36% more points than the coaches they replaced,\" it claimed. \"An improvement (at least 0.2 points per match more on average) was recorded in 60% of cases.\" Train fails to take strain Being Britain's fastest middle-distance runner made no difference for Andy Baddeley in the rush for a seat on Monday. The Olympic 1500m finalist finished second in the British grand prix at Gateshead at 4pm and was on the 6.30 from Newcastle to London. But far from being able to relax, he was forced to stand for the 3\u00bd-hour journey home.
