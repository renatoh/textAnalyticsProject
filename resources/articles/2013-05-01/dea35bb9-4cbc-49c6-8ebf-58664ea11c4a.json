A YouGov survey suggests a majority of British businesses could be failing to implement even basic security practice. More than half of decision-makers said their business did not regularly check whether sensitive corporate information had been leaked, and more than 40% never conducted a risk assessment of the threats to their companies. The poll was analysed by Actis \u2013 Applied Counter-Terrorism, Terrorism, Intelligence &amp; Security Studies, a branch of SMC (Swiss Management Center) University, which offers education, consultancy and research in counter-intelligence and security. More than 80% of British businesses would fail a simple counter-terrorism test, according to the Actis analysis, with 54% of respondents saying their businesses had either never or not recently checked whether any sensitive information about their organisation was publicly available. In 2009 , more than 10,000 confidential client memos sent through Bloomberg's private messaging system were published online by a former employee, Actis said. Sensitive conversations, including messages from traders at more than a dozen of the world's largest banks, remained openly available through a simple Google search until earlier this year, it added. Companies had not prepared a list of potential risks to their business in 40% of cases and just over a third said their companies do not enforce any sort of computer password policy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
