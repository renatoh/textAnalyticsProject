Each entry in the completed diagram is made up of the first half of one word (in one case a two-word compound) followed by the second half of another word whose first half appears elsewhere. Each clue consists of definitions of its two component words, plus a cryptic indication of the entry (a non-word in many cases). The three elements do not overlap and may appear in any order, with no superfluous wording between them. Two letter-pairs forming the second halves among the 4-letter answers are shared by two entries. Method recommended is to find, after solving a clue, another clue to an entry of the same length which contains a definition of the word of which it is the second half. This should help in positioning the two separate halves. Every real word used is in Chambers. Competitors should submit with their entries a clue in the form of all the others to 34 Across, which must be deduced. The Chambers Dictionary (2014) is recommended.
