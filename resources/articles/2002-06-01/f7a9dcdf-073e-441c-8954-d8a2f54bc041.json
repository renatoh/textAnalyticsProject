Had I realised before I set off that I would begin this Land's End-John O'Groats trip by cycling up gradients as steep as one in three, I might well have changed my plans, thereby missing out on some of Britain's most stunning scenery. The start Not wishing to over-egg the cycle pudding, I travelled the 12 miles from Penzance to Land's End in a taxi, thankfully unobserved by the half-dozen sinewy men comparing bicycles at the start line. Intending to reach John O'Groats in two weeks, they were carrying tents and extensive spare parts. With my five-week itinerary, \u00a32.99 Woolworth's puncture repair kit and list of cosy B&amp;Bs, I felt like rather a lightweight. They swiftly left me for dust. The initial stretch was glorious. I bowled along effortlessly, taking a couple of steepish climbs in my stride and making good time. As I freewheeled down the hill into Penzance somewhat faster than the 20mph speed limit, I was therefore rather surprised to note that two hours had elapsed. I eventually covered the 42 miles to Truro and a very welcome first overnight stop in eight hours, wondering whether perhaps rather more training might have been in order. The slog The next day took me to Tintagel, which I now know sits at the top of a very steep hill. Then I hit the South-West Coast Path, which hugs the craggy cliffs of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. The 20-mile stretch from Tintagel to Bude cuts through deserted pastureland, plunging repeatedly from cliff top to sea-level and up again, with stunning headland views as far as the eye can see. On balance, the scenery was worth the slog, but there were moments as I toiled up the steepest sections when I doubted it. The next stretch into Devon was mercifully flat, although my bed for the night in Great Torrington was at the top of a street straight out of a Hovis commercial. The pensioners who live there trot up without a thought, but with panniers on a bike it's no laughing matter. So far I've been overtaken by a jogger, some Sunday strollers and a crisp packet caught on a breeze. Exmoor I spent a day in glorious isolation on southern Exmoor, passed by perhaps five cars an hour. The road travels for miles through moor and grazing land before reaching the picturesque villages of Withypool and Winsford. I spent the night in Brompton Regis, which I nominate as Britain's best village, and not just because it sits on my namesake, the Pulham River. Set in a valley between the rollercoaster hills of west Somerset, Brompton Regis has superb views, a pub, a shop, a post office, a tea room, two B&amp;Bs and a thriving community spirit. What more could you want? Well, for starters, the reinstatement of milk and newspaper deliveries, a bus service, a reduction in the children's four-hour daily commute to school and a brake on the second-home purchases that are slowly strangling rural communities, according to the locals I spoke to. The jubilee Had I stayed in London for the jubilee weekend, no doubt the festivities would have passed me by. As it is, I've passed through countless villages decked in bunting and union flags, and attended a lively street party in Tintagel. Once their hangovers clear, the organisers assure me a full account of the party will be available at http://www.tintagelweb.co.uk. In Great Torrington I watched as an entire town embarked on a 12-hour orgy of good-natured drinking and dancing in the market square, and in Brompton Regis I was privileged to spend an evening in the pub with the village's victorious jubilee tug-of-war team. The Somerset Levels With legs aching somewhat and no sign yet of the bronzed, muscled thighs I had envisaged developing, I skirted round the south of the Quantocks and travelled 30 miles through the lazy cyclist's paradise that is the Somerset Levels. Straight, narrow lanes and water channels cover this drained marshland, which once lay below the sea and would give Norfolk a run for its money on the pancake stakes. The terrain is pretty if unexciting - but it makes for rapid cycling. Cheddar gorging I spent a disagreeable night in Bridgwater, an urban sprawl of dual carriageways, hypermarkets and pasty youths hanging around a dingy shopping precinct. Appropriately enough I saw the first - but no doubt not the last - rain of my trip here and was glad to leave. Tonight I'm in Cheddar: I've decided not to join the crowds at the caves and am gorging myself on locally produced cheese instead. Tomorrow I head off through the Gorge to the Mendips. No doubt they'll be flat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
