Bright, bubbly. She was always the one that made the friends when we went on our holidays in the caravan.\u201d Old video footage of Katherine barrelling about, and family photographs of her grinning face, attest to this, Andrea\u2019s memory of her daughter\u2019s childhood. What they don\u2019t show is the truth. The Family Secret (Channel 4) is the record of that truth because, as Katherine puts it: \u201cI spent 25 years carrying it. And now I just feel like \u2013 not any more.\u201d It is circled around at first, quietly, unsensationally, by the makers of the documentary, like archaeologists assessing the width and breadth of a site before they get to work. Delicately, they brush away layer upon layer of trauma and pain to reveal the event buried deep beneath. First it becomes clear that Katherine was abused as a child. Then it becomes clear that she is preparing to confront the perpetrator in a meeting arranged by a restorative justice organisation. Finally, it becomes clear that her abuser was her older brother, Robert, who was 10 or 11 when he started raping his seven-year-old sister. She doesn\u2019t remember every detail of the first time he penetrated her \u2013 when she was first allowed to stay at their grandad\u2019s for the night \u2013 but she remembers how much it hurt when she had to get up afterwards and do a wee. \u201cEverything that was safe in the world was not safe any more,\u201d says Katherine, who speaks directly at all times, her language and attitude shorn of all embellishments that might obscure or soften her story. \u201cThat fucking poor little girl.\u201d The abuse went on for three and a half years. She remembers his breath, \u201cthe quiver in his voice\u201d and his hands all over her \u201clike an octopus into my private parts\u201d. At their meeting, supervised by a mediator, Kate, Robert describes it as becoming increasingly intimate. Katherine stops him. Not intimate. \u201cI never wanted it. It was rape.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d says Robert immediately. \u201cI understand completely.\u201d \u201cI was seven,\u201d she replies. From what Robert says, and the mediator and Katherine draw out of him, he seems to have used her simply to pursue a high he enjoyed. \u201cEuphoria \u2026 I think it was all selfish desires.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re saying,\u201d Kate says, calmly, \u201cthat you didn\u2019t really think about Katherine in the process. She was just a means to an end?\u201d \u201cIt sounds so callous,\u201d says Robert. \u201cBut \u2013 yes, it was.\u201d It stopped when Katherine got a new bedroom, \u201cwith a new bed with a desk underneath\u201d. \u201cSomething in my gut told me I was ready for him. I didn\u2019t want him to do that to me in my new bedroom.\u201d Your heart aches for the 10-year-old defending her unsullied space. She fought him \u2013 for far from the first time \u2013 and this time won. She split his 14-year-old lip and he never again padded across the landing from his bedroom to hers after their parents were asleep. But she remembers one later incident as clearly as any of the physical abuse. Frustrated with a computer game she was playing, she said: \u201cFuck me!\u201d Robert overheard and said: \u201cI would, but you won\u2019t let me.\u201d That\u2019s when she first truly reckoned there was something wrong with him and felt he was dangerous in the wider world. She made it through teenagehood, university and getting a job, but describes herself as \u201con the inside, just crumbling away.\u201d When she had a baby, she couldn\u2019t bear for Robert to touch him \u201cbecause I knew where his hands had been\u201d and decided to tell her parents the truth. \u201cIf you could hear a heart break,\u201d she says, \u201cyou would have heard Mum\u2019s.\u201d Her mother hugged her, told her she believed her, and told her they should go to the police. She and her husband have since separated because, he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see my son in trouble. Even if it was my daughter.\u201d A legal technicality meant that although Robert confessed everything, he could not be prosecuted. The meeting is all the recourse Katherine has left. There is no narrator to the programme and the camera is unobtrusive. It captures her impossibly dignified, full-blooded, quiet denunciation of her brother, her description of the effects of his depravity on her and on the family and her expulsion of him from her life. There are no histrionics. There are barely any tears. It was as powerful a portrait of a family not shocked, not grieving, but harrowed to its very soul as we are likely to see. My only fear is of lesser, copycat versions to follow by less scrupulous and disciplined film-makers, but let us hope conscience prevails. \u201cI feel like I am really me now,\u201d were Katherine\u2019s final words. She is extraordinary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
