In fact it is \u2013 or was thought to be \u2013 immortal, left forever as the setting of James Joyce\u2019s The Dead, a masterpiece considered one of the greatest short stories in the English language. In the 1890s the writer\u2019s maternal great-aunts ran a music school at the four-storey house, 15 Usher\u2019s Island, and hosted Christmas parties that Joyce used as the scene for the story, a meditation on love, loss and identity. Evergreen themes, it turns out, because last week city authorities announced a plan to turn the House of the Dead into a 54-room hostel, prompting an outcry that property deals were trashing culture and zombifying Ireland\u2019s capital to make way for foreign tourists, students and tech workers. \u201cIt\u2019s a great travesty,\u201d said PJ Murphy, who runs Sweny\u2019s, a former pharmacy that features in another Joyce masterwork, Ulysses, and is now a museum trust lined with Joyce tomes. \u201cIt should remain a place to visit by people who have read Joyce. To turn it into a hostel is a great tragedy.\u201d Artists, academics and others echoed the sentiment. \u201cDublin can build all the hotel/hostel rooms it likes, but if it continues to disregard and demolish its unique cultural heritage it will obliterate what remains of the heart of the city and there will be little left for visitors or indeed for Dubliners themselves to appreciate,\u201d John McCourt, a professor of English literature, wrote in the Irish Times. \u201cThese endless hostels and hotels are symptoms of a whiskey and leprechaun version of Ireland \u2026 which ignores climate change and the need to appeal to locals as well as those arriving, shamrock-eyed, via long-haul flights,\u201d tweeted novelist Paula McGrath. The row is the latest twist in a venerable debate about the nurturing \u2013 and crushing \u2013 of art. Joyce himself framed it best: \u201cIreland is the old sow that eats her farrow.\u201d The line, uttered by his alter ego Stephen Dedalus in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, alluded to the parochialism and spiritual impoverishment that prompted Joyce\u2019s self-exile to continental Europe in 1904. More than a century later, Ireland is culturally unrecognisable \u2013 tolerant, open, ethnically diverse. But artists \u2013 and artistic legacy \u2013 now face a threat from hotels, hostels and offices that are popping up like toast across Dublin. Each month seems to augur fresh expansions by Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and other tech giants that have their European headquarters here. More than 80 new hotel projects with names like Aloft, Central, Hyatt, Grafton, Hard Rock, Iveagh Garden, Marlin, Mayson, Radisson and Wetherspoon are at various stages of development. The influx has brought jobs and money but also increased the cost of living. This has worsened a homelessness crisis \u2013 3,873 children are in emergency accommodation in Ireland, it emerged last week, the state\u2019s highest ever level \u2013 and forced musicians, writers and other creatives to leave. Others, like Stephen James Smith, Dublin\u2019s unofficial poet laureate, survive by couch-surfing. Bohemian musical venues are shutting, unable to pay rents, a trend replicated in San Francisco. The County Wicklow musician Hozier was among the many who mourned the closure of the Bernard Shaw pub. Dublin city councillors recently voted to cap new hotels to halt the \u201cincreasing erosion of cultural life and space\u201d. The vote has questionable legal and political force. The council and the Office of Public Work, after all, had ample opportunity to buy the protected property that Joyce called the \u201cdark gaunt house on Usher\u2019s Island\u201d when it came on the market two years ago. They didn\u2019t. Instead two private investors, Fergus McCabe and Brian Stynes, snapped it up for \u20ac650,000 (\u00a3560,000). According to an official notice posted outside the gate last week they now seek planning permission to turn it into a 54-room hostel with a cafe. Not everyone is horrified. Eugene Lewan, a tourist from Washington state, reckoned the business could respect the legacy. \u201cIf the hostel was themed around Joyce that might be OK.\u201d All the cries of cultural vandalism, of defilement of literature\u2019s great temple, cloud a melancholy fact: the building is already vandalised, already defiled, victim of a century of neglect. Built in about 1775 on the south bank of the Liffey for a grain merchant, Joshua Pim, the structure is largely unchanged from the time Joyce\u2019s great-aunts occupied it. Publication of The Dead in 1914 \u2013 included in the short story collection Dubliners \u2013 made the house famous. But it fell into disuse and decay, its roof broken, its interiors ravaged by squatters, the whole building almost destroyed by fire in the mid-1990s. A Joyce-loving barrister, Brendan Kilty, bought and tried to rescue it. He refurbished the ground floor, restored period decor, hosted literary events and reenacted the Christmas dinner scene, only to end up filing for bankruptcy and selling the property in 2017. When the Observer visited last week there was nothing to indicate the building\u2019s significance, not even a plaque. It looked abandoned: there was litter outside, weeds clogging the basement steps, the windows grubby, the facade chipped and peeling \u2013 a sad version of the elegant home featured in the 1987 film version of The Dead directed by John Huston. Neighbouring buildings have fared little better. This is a rundown part of Dublin you don\u2019t see on postcards. Last week two Italian tourists were mugged at gunpoint up the road. \u201cThe amount of Americans that come here looking for the Joyce house \u2013 I tell them it\u2019s the derelict looking one with weeds,\u201d said Mark Farrell, 53, who runs a nearby scooter rental business. \u201cIt\u2019s going to rack and ruin. Most of them can\u2019t believe the state it\u2019s in.\u201d Farrell did not consider it to be a good neighbourhood for backpackers and students. \u201cTo have a hostel down here is insane. After dark it\u2019s bandit land.\u201d Whatever the fate of the House of the Dead, the man who immortalised it may make a posthumous return. Two city councillors want to repatriate his remains from Switzerland. Joyce\u2019s tomb would be Dublin\u2019s newest tourist attraction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
