In an appearance on an MSNBC radio show hosted by Don Imus, Mr Kerry said: \"There is nothing to report, nothing to talk about. There's nothing there. There's no story.\" His comments marked the first widespread public airing in the US of unsubstantiated allegations made in the Drudge Report and repeated in some British newspapers today. Amid signs that the presidential race could be shaping up as a tough and dirty fight, Mr Kerry hit back today at attacks from the Republican camp intended to undermine his support. Last night the George Bush re-election campaign posted on its website an advertisement-style video juxtaposing Mr Kerry's promises to staunch the influence of lobbyists in Washington with news articles about large numbers of donations to Mr Kerry from lobbyists. Mr Kerry said today that he expected a barrage of criticism and spoiling from the Republicans over the course of the campaign, saying: \"These guys will want to try to do everything to change the subject. \"But the subject is 3 million jobs lost in the last few years, it's health care that's completely unaffordable and unreachable for tens of millions of Americans, it's kids who are not getting a decent education all across America.\" Referring to previous election campaigns, Mr Kerry said: \"I've been pretty well, you know, vetted and examined from one side to the other. And I think that they're in for a surprise. I'm going to fight back. I am a fighter, and I'm ready to fight back.\" Mr Kerry received a boost today when retired US general Wesley Clark, who earlier this week pulled out of the race to win the Democratic presidential nomination, backed the senator's candidacy. The former Nato supreme commander appeared alongside Mr Kerry at a campaign rally in Wisconsin this afternoon to offer his support over the rest of the campaign to choose a Democratic challenger to Mr Bush. \"Request permission to come aboard; the army's here,\" Mr Clark, a retired four-star general told Mr Kerry, a navy lieutenant during the Vietnam War, as the two stood together on stage. Mr Kerry had already hoped to win support in Wisconsin from those voters previously loyal to Mr Clark. The retired general's backing is now expected to secure Mr Kerry a healthy victory in next Tuesday's primary election. There are 72 delegates at stake in Michigan, and current polls put Mr Kerry ahead of rivals John Edwards and Howard Dean. The three are fighting for the right to face Mr Bush in November's presidential election. Mr Kerry, a Massachusetts senator, already has 539 delegates, according to an Associated Press count, compared with 182 for Mr Dean, former governor of Vermont, and 166 for Edwards, a North Carolina senator. It takes 2,161 delegates to win the nomination for president."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
