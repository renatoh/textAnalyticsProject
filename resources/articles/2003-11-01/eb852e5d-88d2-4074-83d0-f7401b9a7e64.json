They saw. They gave it away. Hibernian proved the friendliest of foes yesterday when they brought about their own downfall at Hearts. Own goals from Alen Orman and Gary Smith gave Hearts bragging rights in Edinburgh and their sixth consecutive victory at home and in Europe before Thursday's Uefa Cup return match against Bordeaux. It also confirmed Hearts as the country's third best team, although they lag hopelessly behind the Old Firm, who maintained their winning form. At Tynecastle, though, the two own goals were an entirely fitting way of deciding a frantic, dreadfully poor derby. The first came after just nine minutes and with the pantomime season almost upon us was an early example of what can be expected. A mishit Paul Hartley corner had fans of his former club laughing, until first Grant Brebner failed to get the ball away with a wild swipe, then Kevin Thomson managed to hack his clearance against the hapless Orman. The ball ricocheted past Daniel Anderson. It was a playground goal to lose and, indeed, much of Hibs' efforts thereafter belonged in the same arena. They failed to trouble Hearts seriously at any stage and that was an abdication of their responsibilities, especially as the home team lost their influential captain Steven Pressley to injury after only 22 minutes and he has been ruled out of the Bordeaux tie. Not that Hearts were much better. Patrick Kisnorbo and Hartley had half-hearted efforts before victory was assure after 68 minutes when again Hibs inflicted the damage upon themselves. Robbie Neilson's cross from the right was inviting enough but he expected Mark de Vries and not Smith to stick a leg out and divert it past Anderson. It settled a match littered with bookings and substitutions. The Hearts pair, Alan Maybury and Kisnorbo, were cautioned together with Hibs' Scott Brown and Orman. \"It was a job well done,\" said Hearts' manager Craig Levein. \"And don't think I'm bothered we won through two own goals. It was a normal derby but I felt we deserved to win.\" Celtic made it 24 goals in their last five outings as they won 5-1 on Saturday at Dundee United, courtesy of a Chris Sutton hat-trick and a double from Henrik Larsson, while second-placed Rangers left it late before a Stephen Hughes header and two goals from the Dane Peter Lovenkrands ensured victory against Aberdeen, who had Zander Diamond sent off. Now Celtic and Rangers face more taxing Champions League business with Bayern Munich at Parkhead tomorrow and a difficult fixture in Stuttgart awaiting the Ibrox team on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
