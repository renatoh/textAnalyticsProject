How do we organise the ceremony? Can you recommend a wedding chapel and do they offer renewal of vows rather than a wedding? How do we find Elvis and how much is it likely to cost? Margaret Unsworth, Sheffield One of the reasons Las Vegas became the mecca for a quick hitch is that it's easy to tie the knot there. In fact, if the idea of strolling (or driving) into the chapel of your choice doesn't appeal, you can exchange vows on the deck of a pirate ship, on top of a replica Eiffel Tower or - the connoisseur's choice - dressed as a Klingon on the deck of the USS Enterprise. A renewal of vows shouldn't take too much planning, as long as you don't want to do it on Valentine's Day or at New Year, in which case book ahead or be prepared to queue - very romantic. Simply take your wedding certificate to the chapel of your choice and you should be back at your hotel in a matter of hours, or even less on occasion. Ceremonies start at around \u00a350 (not including licence if you're not already married), but can rise into the thousands of dollars. For Elvis, you can expect to pay around \u00a3300-\u00a3400 (see www.gracelandchapel.com, for the King's Package, including free T-shirts, champagne and a recital from the Elvis back catalogue). There are lots of sources of information for those wanting to wed in Las Vegas - try www.vegas.com/weddings for plenty of helpful advice. Views in Iceland At the end of July my husband and I will be visiting Iceland and would like to try whale watching, geyser spotting and hot springs swimming. We have a seven-year-old son who is wheelchair bound. Can you suggest a few 'must-dos' and give us some tips as to attitude to disability in Iceland. Christine Hofstetter, Leamington Spa Iceland is on a par with other northern European countries for disabled access, meaning you'll find increasing numbers of hotels, restaurants and attractions catering for wheelchair-based travellers and their families. A helpful organisation to contact is the National Association for the Disabled in Iceland (00 354 552 9133). As your whole family will be out there, think about hiring a car - the expense will be worth it as you'll be more flexible. The country has a lot to see in a small area, but you should make sure you take in the 'Golden Circle' attractions of Gullfoss waterfall, Pingvellir archaeological site and the Geysir geothermal site. You can see these in a day, but you may want to take your time, especially if your visit coincides with the arrival of a few coachloads of daytrippers from the capital. The famous Blue Lagoon is at Grindavik, close to the capital, and is another must-see. Whale watching is possible at several places - trips normally run from April to October. If time permits, a trip to the city of Akureyri and Lake Myvatn, well-known for its tranquillity and diverse bird life would show you another side to the country. A new budget airline flying from Stansted to Iceland is Iceland Express and Icelandair (0870 787 4020) has a wide range of packages. Accommodation in Venice My partner and I have booked flights to Venice in June for a week and we plan to find accommodation when we get there. We would like to spend a couple of days in the city and then explore the surrounding area. Do you have any tips about where we should visit? We are on a budget, so is it relatively easy to find cheap accommodation? How easy would it be to use the trains to travel around? Frances Hall, by email It isn't easy to find cheap accommodation in Venice, so I would advise booking your nights in advance. The hostel Foresteria Valdese (00 39 041 5286 797) has doubles for \u00a336 or \u00a348 with a bathroom. Or try Hotel Santa Lucia (00 39 041 715180), near the train station in Cannaregio, which has doubles for similar prices, depending on the season. Trains are regular and good value - get more information on www.trenitalia.com. Use Belluno, a beautiful little town, as a base to explore the Dolomite mountains. There are lots of good B&amp;Bs and you can visit Treviso on the way. Verona is also an easy train ride from Venice. Its golden era came during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries under the Della Scala family. The savage family feuding was alluded to in Romeo &amp; Juliet - you can swoon underneath what myth says was her balcony. Villa Francescati, the youth hostel in Verona, is recommended and family rooms are only \u00a320 a night. Birthday in Cape Town My husband is 50 on Christmas Day. We're thinking of visiting Cape Town and the surrounding area for a holiday with our three sons, aged 12, 10 and five. Our eldest will be 13 on 23 December - so we would like somewhere special (ideally near the beach) to stay over Christmas. Have you got any ideas? Alison Courtney, Oxford The suburbs along the Atlantic coast or False Bay are the best options, but if you're hiring a car you can be much more flexible. Monkey Valley Beach Nature Resort is a small resort, 20 miles south of the city centre, with rustic cabins shaded by a milkwood forest. A cabin sleeping six is \u00a3200 a night over Christmas - you'll need to book well in advance. It offers plenty of activities, but with Noordhoek's splendid beach moments away you might not need any other distraction. In Simon's Town, the Outpost guesthouse has a family unit for \u00a317-\u00a330 per person. The rooms are set high above the yacht basin with breathtaking views. It's a short walk into historic Simon's Town and only just over a mile to Boulders Beach, where 3,000 African penguins hang out. There's also an excellent range of self-catering accommodation in Simon's Town at www.sa-venues.com. \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall and Fiona Christie from Lonely Planet address as many as possible here. Email travel.tips@observer.co.uk or write to Escape, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. The writer of the week's star letter wins a Lonely Planet guide of their choice (so include a daytime telephone number and postal address). No individual correspondence can be entered into."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
