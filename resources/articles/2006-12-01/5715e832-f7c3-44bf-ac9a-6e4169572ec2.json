Once a week the town overflowed with livestock as well as farmers and their families from across the Blackmoor Vale and beyond. Pubs, cafes and shops were full; it was generally the farmers' one day out. In the 1990s there was anxiety and controversy about the market's likely closure and the effect it might have on the way of life of the farming community and on its working practices. A team of film-makers called Trilith made a documentary. I talked with one of them, John Holman, in a tiny room at the top of Wincanton's community centre. He was hemmed in by computers, recording equipment and video monitors. I had come to ask him about Farm Radio. He told me that it was when they had heard the talk at Sturminster market, and sensed the deprivation that the market's closure might bring, that the idea of Farm Radio came to them. At the market, farmers and their wives, briefly released from the daily round at home, met others, talked, joked and shared experience. But in 1998, the market did indeed close and, as a result, farming families were likely to feel more isolated; the opportunity to chat and to spread ideas and good practice by word of mouth was gone. Radio, the film-makers thought, might preserve something of what had been lost. I went home and listened on www.farmradio.org.uk to a story about the retirement of the doyen of breeders of Dorset Down sheep, and another about Arthur Hollins, a visionary pioneer of organic farming who was said to have introduced yoghurt to Britain. The noticeboard page directed me to advice for farmers approaching retirement and a discussion about the potential in growing crops for bio-fuels. And there was an item about Tractor Challenge - the plan was to assemble 2,006 working tractors in one field in the year 2006. That might have raised a smile at the market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
