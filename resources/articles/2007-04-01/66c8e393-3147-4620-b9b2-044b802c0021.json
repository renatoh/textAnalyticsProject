As the pilots of Spitfires and Hurricanes became celebrities to many, the work of the long-range bombers threw up few heroes, with the exception of Guy Gibson and Leonard Cheshire. Fighter Boys, whose deeds were plain for all to see in the Battle of Britain, the members of Bomber Command did their work well away from the public eye. As the pilots of Spitfires and Hurricanes became celebrities to many, the work of the long-range bombers threw up few heroes, with the exception of Guy Gibson and Leonard Cheshire. Yet their work was just as vital in prosecuting the Allied war effort. While what they were asked to carry out is now considered to be dirty work, Bishop makes abundantly clear that the pilots and aircrew, despite the manifest perils of their missions, had an innate sense of the rightness of what their orders were. He deals dispassionately with the missions against Hamburg and Dresden, arguing, rightly in my view, that they were both legitimate targets. But beside the individual elements of the air campaign, Bishop builds up an intimate day-to-day portrait of life in Bomber Command, through an extensive series of interviews. Perhaps the most affecting chapter concerns wartime romances and the reluctance of fliers to propose to their sweethearts, knowing that a bride could all too soon become a widow. In 1932, Stanley Baldwin had argued to the House of Commons that: 'The bomber will always get through.' As Patrick Bishop makes graphically clear in this superbly written and authoritative book, that, sadly, was not the case (more than 50,000 crewmen lost their lives, one tenth of the military war dead of Britain and the Commonwealth). But it wasn't for the want of sheer courage and endeavour of the members of Bomber Command, who now have a fitting commemoration of their heroic deeds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
