Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said the fact that the proportion of pupils who pass A-levels rose from 78% to nearly 97% between 1990 and 2008, when the respected international baccalaureate (IB) had remained almost constant, was proof of a relative fall in standards. Conservatives also accused the government of \"dumbing down\" the exams system, as they set out plans to overhaul school league tables to reward those that opt to teach \"harder\" qualifications. Some 250,000 A-level students will receive their results on Thursday, with the pass rate and the proportion receiving the top grades expected to rise for the 27th year in succession. Teachers, headteachers and the government all insisted the improvement is down to pupils' hard work, and ministers said changes in the assessment mechanisms over the period made them impossible to compare. But Smithers said: \"If you are working to a standard you'd expect the pass rate to remain about the same. With the A-levels you see built-in inflation. It's becoming easier and easier to get the top grades. \"In 1990 the IB and the A-levels were about the same in terms of percentage pass rate. There's now a difference of 20 percentage points. In relation to the IB, A-levels have got easier.\" He said there had been rows at several private schools that had switched to the IB only to see pupils expected to get straight As struggling to pass the IB because it was harder. Under the Conservative plans schools would score extra points for maths and physics A-levels instead of supposedly \"easier\" subjects, such as media studies. School exam results published annually are used by the media to compile league tables used by parents. Michael Gove, the shadow education secretary, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, said: \"Every A-level is assumed to be of equal value when it comes to measuring school performance, but universities are explicit that they don't consider every A-level to be equally rigorous. Cambridge, the London School of Economics [LSE] and others have warned prospective students that taking 'softer' A-levels, such as media studies and dance, will count against applicants at admission time.\" Tory reforms would lead the system \"away from politicians meddling, micromanaging, and dumbing down,\" he said. The plans are contained in a review being conducted by the former rector of Imperial College London, Sir Richard Sykes. They would also see: \u2022 Vocational qualifications removed from the league tables, including the government's new diplomas, which schools would then abandon. \u2022 The end of judging schools by the proportion of pupils who gain five A* to C grades, after accusations that this has encouraged schools to focus on C-D borderline students. The government already plans to do something similar. \u2022 A new league table based on the destination of school-leavers, giving higher points for entry to top universities. The government has acknowledged problems in the current system of league tables and earlier this year set out plans for a new annual report card for schools, which would include more information on the school's ethos, sporting achievements and behavioural standards. A survey of 150 A-level teachers by the thinktank Civitas found none believed the rise in A-level grades was due to students becoming brighter, with most blaming changes in assessment and teaching that allowed students to re-sit exams and made classes more focused on exams. Ministers rejected the claim that they had \"dumbed down\" exams. Vernon Coaker, the schools minister, said: \"Let's stop running down the hard work of teachers and pupils in results week.\" John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned that excluding vocational qualifications would entrench the divide between learning and training. \"This is not the week to be talking about dumbed down A-levels when young people and their teachers have put so much effort into getting their grades,\" he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
