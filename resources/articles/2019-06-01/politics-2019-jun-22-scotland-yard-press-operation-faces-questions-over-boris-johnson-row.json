The Metropolitan police twice failed to give the Guardian information about officers being dispatched to Symonds\u2019s flat in south London after a 999 call early on Friday morning \u2013 the second time even after Scotland Yard had been given the unique CAD (computer-aided dispatch) number. Only after persistent questioning by the Guardian \u2013 including giving precise details about the time of the police call-out, as well as the identification numbers of police vehicles that attended the scene \u2013 did Scotland Yard finally confirm details about the incident. It is common practice for police forces to provide basic details about officers attending incidents, including whether or not arrests have been made. When police attended the scene, an officer could be heard on the radio asking a colleague to \u201crestrict it\u201d. When asked, police did not clarify what the phrase meant. The Guardian\u2019s disclosure of the row between Johnson and Symonds amplified scrutiny of the politician\u2019s bid to enter No 10 as the UK\u2019s next prime minister. One neighbour said they had heard a woman screaming followed by \u201cslamming and banging\u201d. On a recording made by the neighbour, heard by the Guardian, Symonds can be heard telling Johnson to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d. The couple can be heard rowing about spilt red wine, with Symonds telling him: \u201cYou just don\u2019t care for anything because you\u2019re spoilt. You have no care for money or anything.\u201d At one stage, Johnson can be heard telling Symonds to \u201cget off my fucking laptop\u201d before a loud crashing noise. The neighbour said that after becoming concerned, they knocked on the door, but received no response, and so called 999. After a call to the Met\u2019s press office on Friday, the Guardian sent a follow-up email providing details of the street where the incident took place and the time police were called. The press office responded asking for more information, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve checked call lists for both Lambeth and Southwark and I can\u2019t see any calls to [street name] for this time.\u201d After being asked for more details, the Guardian responded with additional information, including the CAD number and information that the incident was attended by two police cars and a van. Later, the press office responded, saying: \u201cWe have no knowledge of a domestic incident at that location. If you have more information about the nature of the call, please let us know.\u201d It is unclear whether or not the press office had access to the relevant information at this stage or whether it had been restricted. The Guardian replied: \u201cAre you able to confirm that there was a call-out that resulted in that reference number?\u201d The Guardian further provided a number plate for one of the police cars attending the scene, and said that there was audio of the police officers at the address and pictures of their vehicles. The Metropolitan police then finally confirmed details of the incident, providing a statement saying: \u201cAt 00.47 on Friday 21 June police responded to a call from a local resident in the SE5 area of Camberwell. \u201cThe caller was concerned for the welfare of a female neighbour. Police attended and spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well. There were no offences or concerns apparent to the officers and there was no cause for police action.\u201d After being questioned by the Guardian over why Scotland Yard twice failed to provide information about the incident despite being provided with specific details, a spokesman said: \u201cWe require media to provide us with specific information including date, time, location of incident and nature of incident in order to trace a matter and provide them with details. \u201cThis matter was reported to police as a concern for welfare and not a domestic incident. The reporter was advised that no details could be found based on the information provided and invited to provide more information. \u201cShortly afterwards we were able to confirm details and provided information to the reporter. The press office did not at any point deny or refuse to confirm that police had attended an address in Camberwell, and any suggestions of a cover-up are completely false.\u201d Guidance published by the College of Policing, a professional body for employees of police forces in England and Wales, states: \u201cResponses to media inquiries about investigations or police activity should be open, honest and transparent. Clear reasoning should be recorded if a decision is made to withhold information because its release would have a detrimental impact on the investigation or operation.\u201d It goes on: \u201cThe journalist must provide sufficient additional detail to identify an investigation or incident, without reference to a named person, before being provided with information about the investigation.\u201d Any information released by police should \u201cas a minimum\u201d include the allegation or offence, the date the information was received, which unit is investigating, arrests, interviews under caution, and bail conditions or charges made. A spokesman for Johnson has so far refused to comment on the incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
