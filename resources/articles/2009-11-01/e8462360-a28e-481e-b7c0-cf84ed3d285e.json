The post, while formally the junior of the two, is potentially the more powerful. It comes with a large budget, a large machine, a more detailed job description, and 10 years of practice behind it. It is also the only major post in Brussels to bridge the two important bodies of power: the European Council, grouping the governments of the member states, and the European Commission, the EU's main executive and bureaucracy. The high representative job combines the foreign policy post \u2013 currently held by Javier Solana of Spain \u2013 with the European commissioner for external relations job, held by the Austrian Benita Ferrero-Waldner. While working to the 27 governments of the EU member states and chairing monthly meetings of EU foreign ministers, the post is simultaneously, as vice-president of the European commission, enhancing its clout. Lady Ashton will not decide a single European policy, because that barely exists on topics as diverse as relations with Russia, Iran's nuclear programmes or the war in Afghanistan. But she will have to endeavour to produce coherence from frequent cacophony and steer the more powerful EU countries towards common positions that are not simply lowest common denominator policies. A key part of the job will be to oversee the external action service, the EU's embryonic diplomatic service, which has almost 200 offices all over the world. A bureaucratic tussle for power is going on behind the scenes over who will control this diplomatic service \u2013 the Brussels centre or the national governments. The European parliament is also staking its claim to oversight. As vice-president in the commission, Ashton will need to go before it for hearings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
