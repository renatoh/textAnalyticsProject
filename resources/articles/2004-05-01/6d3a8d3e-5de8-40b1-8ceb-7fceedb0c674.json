I had a grid map with me. The RAF had taken a lot of very good pictures but they couldn't be sure from the air what the things they'd circled on the map were. First we had to reckon up the beach for landmines and take sand samples for landing the tanks - you had to know what type of beach it was. We kept going on the arterial road towards the Arromanches and Caen main road. The next morning we looked out of the bushes and there, not 30 or 40 feet away, were a tank crew having their coffee. I wonder who would have been more surprised, them or us, if I'd walked up to them and said, 'Give us a cup of coffee!' We continued along the road and it was so quiet we were getting a bit blas\u00e9. All of a sudden we stopped and heard this rumbling. We just had time to get into a low ditch on the side of the road. And lo and behold round the corner came this huge German army convoy with motorcycle outriders. I don't know to this day how they missed us. I was a young man of 20 and absolutely petrified. If I'd had two tin lids strapped on the inside of my knees, Hitler would have heard it in Berlin. We had to retrace our steps back to the submarine. I got back to England, gave my report, had a huge shower, went to sleep, then I was woken up again, had a big feed, put on my battle dress and went back out to Normandy. I was on the beach the whole of the night. At about 1.30am I transferred to the command destroyer moored just off the beaches. The date was 6 June. Around 5am it was so weird and eerie, like a mist. Then it was as if the mist was lifted by a giant hand. It cleared at about a quarter to six. There was a sight you will never, ever forget. Five thousand ships, all out there waiting. You couldn't believe it. You could walk across the Channel on ships. At six o'clock all hell broke loose and all the battleships opened fire together. Can you imagine the din? From then on it was hectic the whole time. The way the Germans had woken up, they had pushed reinforcements in from when the ships were first seen and they really met us with a hail of fire all the time: machine guns, heavy guns. Our ship was under fire all the time and how they didn't sink us I will never know. The troops were dropping down like flies. Some of these lads were 16, 17, 18, 19 and had only just learned how to use a rifle. I'd seen these troops when I'd first come back from Normandy. They'd been on the landing craft two or three days then. I could see they were bedraggled, they'd suffered atrocious weather, they were seasick, praying, some of them nearly crying. You could see it going through their minds, wondering what could happen to them. By 11.30am the troops coming ashore were having to push bodies aside. When you saw them wade through the water, it was such courage. I was so glad to be part of it. I shall never forget watching them go up that beach. There was so much courage there. Lots of things there in the way of bravery and some will never be known about. The bravery was absolutely outstanding. They were all some mother's sons. I still think about it often, especially now. I tell my grandchildren about it and they're very interested. I hope to God they never have to know anything like it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
