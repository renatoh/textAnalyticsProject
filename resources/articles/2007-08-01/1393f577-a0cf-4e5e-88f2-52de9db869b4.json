The bell, which was stopped after 8am, will not sound while the work is being done. The hands of the clock were also stopped so repairs could be begun, but restarted later in the day, and will continue to tell the time. The clock - which marks its 150th anniversary in 2009 - has been halted accidentally before by weather, workmen, breakages and birds. Mike McCann, the Keeper of the Great Clock, said that the process had started 'very well' but that the work had never been attempted before so it was difficult to predict how long it would take."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
