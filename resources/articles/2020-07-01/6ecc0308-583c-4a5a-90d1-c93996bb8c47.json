Podence, who became the ninth Portuguese player at Molineux when he joined from Olympiakos, provided a simple finish to a dainty move in the 41st minute before Adama Traor\u00e9 teed up Jonny to inflict a seventh successive defeat on Crystal Palace. At 5ft 5in Podence was the smallest player on the pitch but exerted a grand influence, with zippy movement and nifty touches making him a regular pest to Palace. The visitors seemed in an irritable mood for most of the game, frustrated not only by their opponents but also by the loss of Mamadou Sakho to injury early on and their chronic inability to turn possession into penetration. This victory took Wolves to their highest points tally since the formation of the Premier League, in a season that started for them last July and will not end until August. A top-four domestic finish is beyond them but a spot in fifth or sixth would guarantee participation in next season\u2019s Europa League \u2013 if they need it; they could still reach the Champions League by winning this season\u2019s Europa League, which resumes next month with Wolves hosting Olympiakos in the second leg of their last\u201116 tie. The first ended 1-1. This was Wolves\u2019 56th match in a campaign interrupted by the lockdown. They have occasionally looked flat since the restart and there were spells in this game when inspiration eluded them. But they won by producing the contest\u2019s key moments of ingenuity. The first came four minutes to the end of a first half in which Palace\u2019s woes were summed up by Sakho\u2019s muscle injury and Jeffrey Schlupp firing wide after clever work by Wilfried Zaha. Wolves barely threatened, with Tyrick Mitchell, a 20-year-old left-back making his first league start for Palace, coping pretty well with Traor\u00e9. The cliche about needing either magic or a mistake to make the game interesting came to mind, and there was no doubt about which looked more likely. But suddenly Wolves broke through with a wonderfully constructed goal featuring an artful one-two between Matt Doherty and Jo\u00e3o Moutinho. The Irishman clipped the ball back from the byline to leave Podence with a simple header into the net. \u201cHe did well,\u201d said Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo of Podence. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of space to improve so let\u2019s try to work to take more advantage of his incredible talent.\u201d Podence flashed that talent again on the hour, conspiring with Traor\u00e9 before Vicente Guaita saved the Spaniard\u2019s shot. Eight minutes later Traor\u00e9 showed his class by bursting between Mitchell and James McArthur on the right \u2013 nutmegging the debutant in the process \u2013 and then passing to Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, whose scuffed shot ran to Jonny. The wingback spun and lashed the ball into the net from 10 yards. Soon after that Guaita had to bolt out of his area to deny Podence after a flick-on by Jim\u00e9nez. But Palace never looked like depriving Wolves of a win that took them to a record Premier League points haul. \u201cThat pleases me a lot,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cThe credit is to the players. It has been a long season \u2013 one calendar year for us \u2013 and this points total is a fair reward for us. Progress season-on-season is the idea. We are improving, building and looking for the next challenge. We embrace that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
