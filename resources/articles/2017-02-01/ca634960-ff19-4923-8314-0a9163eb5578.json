I don\u2019t think anyone expected the way last Friday night panned out \u2013 30,000 people trying to get into Ikon Park was just out of this world. The occasion of being able to play in the first game of the AFL Women\u2019s competition, for it to be Carlton and Collingwood and to have the opportunity to lead the girls out onto the ground, was pretty special. The Carlton football club really does treasure its history and I had plenty of reminders during last week that this would be a very special moment for me. And it was. But now, I\u2019m focussed on this season and doing everything I can to get the most out of myself and the team. When I get older, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll look back and treasure it and be able to share those moments with people in my life in more depth. But at the moment, there is just such great focus on what we are trying to achieve. Last Friday was all about being ready to perform but at the same time soaking in the moment and enjoying doing what we love because it\u2019s the only reason we do what we do. Despite the fact we\u2019re now finally professional athletes, we do it because we love it. When we finally ran out onto the ground, the most poignant thing for me was the noise \u2013 we really struggled to hear each other throughout the whole night, and that was actually really cool. It was actually challenging trying to communicate but it\u2019s an atmosphere I would like to play in every single week because the passion coming from both clubs\u2019 supporters was just incredible. The crowd created a real happiness around the ground. It didn\u2019t feel like the result mattered to anybody, it was almost like they were just so proud and happy for us to be able to achieve that moment and have that first game happen. It was a celebration. As far as the footy was concerned, I\u2019m proud to say we stuck to our structures and our systems for the whole game. All of our girls played the role they were asked to play and it felt like a real team win and something that is a platform for us to begin our season. Our coach, Damien Keeping was really measured in his approach. He is very much an organised, planning coach, and he\u2019s got a really good handle on emotion and channels his emotions to the group really well. We all felt as calm and as relaxed as possible, ready to perform how we wanted to. The hype around the competition is going to be a challenge for everybody \u2013 both the experienced and inexperienced players \u2013 because none of us have received attention like this for our performances before. But at the end of the day, we are footballers and we need to go out and play. So on Saturday, we do it all again when we take on GWS Giants. It\u2019s fantastic that the game is again free and now part of a double header \u2013 so hopefully we\u2019ll see another big crowd. One of the great assets of large crowds that I got to see at the end of last week\u2019s game was when we were thanking everybody for coming there was a real family feel. It was just brilliant - so we\u2019ll just soak that all in again. As for the group, I\u2019m very fortunate as the captain in that there is fantastic leadership across all 28 of our players. I don\u2019t have to do too much \u2013 the girls are quite switched on and leaders in their own right. So my messages will be basic and pretty simple and will echo what the coach needs. I\u2019m sure the girls will be able to perform again and unite as a team with a lot of focus against GWS. The fact is we\u2019ve won one game of football but there are seven rounds and a grand final at the end, of which we would like to be a part. So while we did celebrate our first up success to an extent, we have a long way to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
