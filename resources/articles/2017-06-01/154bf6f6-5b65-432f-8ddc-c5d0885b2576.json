Within nine minutes, officers had concluded among themselves that they were dealing with a terror attack on London\u2019s Muslim community. Witnesses described how the van-driver targeted them as they stood talking. \u201cHe just came into all of us,\u201d said one local resident, who managed to jump to safety. \u201cThere were bodies around me. Thank God I just moved to the side, I just jumped. Everyone is hurt. Everyone is actually hurt.\u201d Events moved quickly at first. In the immediate aftermath, people rushed to help the injured, one of whom was stuck underneath the van. \u201cThe first thing I saw was this man and one of his limbs was was stuck beneath the front left wheel under the van,\u201d one witness said. \u201cHe was shouting, screaming: \u2018Help, help.\u2019 Good, strong Somalis \u2026 lifted the front of the van, the front side of that wheel so that they could release his leg. I could see lots of blood under the van, there was so much blood.\u201d The local resident said he was alerted to the attack by an \u201calmighty bang\u201d in the street outside his house. He ran out in his pyjamas, and found a crowd of people shouting and screaming in Whadcoat Street, close to the Muslim Welfare House. Witnesses said the man stuck beneath the van was of east African origin. Other injured people included: a man of south Asian origin who had collapsed and was being given CPR by passersby; a Somali woman in her 60s or 70s, who appeared to have been thrown several feet by the impact of the van; a man who had suffered a head injury; and another who had apparently suffered a broken foot. Others dealt with the driver of the van. According to witnesses, he tried to escape by running down Whadcoat Street. But he was unable to make it over a tall gate that blocks the end of the cul-de-sac. Three members of the crowd, who spoke to the Guardian, said they were able to grab him and pin him down while they waited for police. \u201cI saw him being shielded by Somalis and Arabs,\u201d a witness said. \u201cLocal youngsters who saw the incident wanted to get to him but the Somali people were protecting the man. \u201cAbout six or seven of them were circling him and they said you\u2019re safe, you\u2019re with us, and they wouldn\u2019t let the local youngsters get to him, so they saved him from dying. They would have killed him if they had let him go.\u201d The imam who had just led prayers is said to have turned up at this point and tried to calm the crowd. \u201cThe imam came from the mosque and he said: \u2018Listen we are fasting, this is Ramadan, we are not supposed to do these kinds of things so please step back,\u2019\u201d one of those who helped to pin the suspect down, who gave his name as Mohammed, said. \u201cFor that reason, this guy is still alive today. This is the only reason. If the imam was not there he wouldn\u2019t be there today.\u201d After the man was arrested, he addressed the onlookers. Adil Rana, 24, said: \u201cWhen he got arrested, he was taunting, saying: \u2018I\u2019d do it again, I\u2019d do it again.\u2019\u201d Footage that subsequently surfaced appeared to show him waving from the back of the police van. There was initial confusion about how many people had carried out the attack, with some on the ground saying they thought three men were in the van and that two had run away. But, within a few hours, police confirmed they had no information to suggest that the attacker had any accomplices. After the rapid start, events slowed considerably. The severity of the situation was not immediately made public and, by the time it was, images and videos purporting to show injured people and a man being arrested were already flooding social media. It was not until after 4am that police confirmed how many people had been injured and not until after 5am that it was announced that the attack was being treated as a terror offence. One person had died, nine had been taken to hospital and two more were treated for minor injuries at the scene, though police clarified that the dead person was being treated for a separate ailment at the time. It is unclear whether or not his death was related. The delay by the authorities led to anger among some, and people at the scene began to get agitated, just as people on social media claimed news outlets were slow to refer to the attack as terror-related. As dawn broke over north London and some calm returned to Finsbury Park, a day of soul-searching and investigation of the suspect\u2019s background lay ahead. And political leaders were forced to turn to a vocabulary that has become depressingly familiar. Theresa May said the attack was \u201cevery bit as sickening\u201d as other recent outrages and that \u201clike all acts of terrorism it seeks to drive us apart\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn said he was \u201cshocked by this horrific and cruel attack\u201d. London mayor Sadiq Khan, meanwhile, was reminded of an earlier horror. \u201cThis attack occurred almost exactly one year to the day that my friend Jo Cox was murdered,\u201d he wrote in the Guardian. \u201cThis weekend, I joined people from across the country at a giant picnic to celebrate Jo\u2019s life and uphold her belief that we have far more in common that unites us than that which divides us \u2026 it is more important now than ever that we focus on those things that unite us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
