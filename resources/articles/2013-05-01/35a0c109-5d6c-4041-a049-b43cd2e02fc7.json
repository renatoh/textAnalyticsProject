Despite initial bipartisan support for the legislation, a number of Republicans attempted to delay implementation of an amnesty-like provision until authorities could prove they had fully secured the southern border with Mexico against further illegal entry. Though defeated by Democrats, who form a majority on the Senate judiciary committee, the Republicans warned the issue would become a sticking point in the House of Representatives. \"If we don't have real border security, in my view this bill will not pass,\" said Ted Cruz of Texas. But this prompted an angry response from the bill's sponsors who accused opponents of using border security as an excuse to block any immigration reform. \"The real reason [he wants this] is Senator Cruz is opposed to a path to citizenship,\" said New York Democrat Chuck Schumer. \"Let's not keep bringing up this false issue of border security. Our bill is tough as nails on border security, but what it does not do is deny 11 million people a path to citizenship.\" At this point, the bipartisan spirit which has led to hopes that immigration reform may be the one big legislative achievement of President Obama's second term quickly began to evaporate. Fellow Texan John Cornyn leapt to Cruz's defence. \"We were doing really well in assuming good faith, but you just impuned people's motives,\" he told Schumer. \"This is a fundamental issue: the public does not trust us. This is not some trick; this is a fundamental precondition to regaining public confidence.\" Cruz demanded an apology from Schumer and invited him to come down to Texas to meet landowners who see \"armed coyotes coming across their property on a daily basis\". Committee chairman Patrick Leahy later attempted to paper over the cracks in the consensus, pointing out that the committee had adopted 21 of the 32 amendments offered on Thursday \u2013 almost all with some degree of bipartisan agreement \u2013 but battle lines have been drawn. Earlier, a third of the members of the judiciary committee voted for two amendments that would delay US immigration reform at its first hurdle, suggesting the bill may face a bumpier ride through Congress than its bipartisan backers had hoped. The first amendment, proposed by the Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, would have required the government to show it had \"fully secured\" the border with Mexico for six months before allowing the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants who are already in the US to begin applying for legal status. Currently, the bill proposes allowing the process to begin as long as the government comes up with a plan to tighten border security further. Though defeated, the attempt to delay the process was supported by five other Republicans on the judiciary committee, which is considering amendments in the first stage of a legislative process that is likely to last until at least July. Only Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Arizona's Jeff Flake, both members of the \"gang of eight\" who proposed the bill last month, voted against their fellow Republicans. Although a Democrat majority on the Senate committee ensures the mark-p process should proceed without any major opposition measure passing, the initial session on Thursday undermined suggestions that there is broad bipartisan support for the immigration reform bill. Some among the gang of eight had hoped for a majority of at least 70 in the full Senate as a show of strength that would give the bill momentum to pass through the Republican-controlled House. Grassley said: \"The bill will struggle to pass the House unless the border security problem is fixed.\" He argued that US public opinion was against anything that would add millions of new legal competitors for jobs without first guaranteeing that no more illegal immigrants would arrive. The committee debate also heard colourful language from the Texas Republican John Cornyn, who said there were also national security concerns \u2013 as some of those coming across the Mexican border were \"wearing turbans\". Graham suggested that many of those crossing from Mexico and other countries were doing so because where they came from was a \"hell hole\". Schumer, one of the key backers of reform, warned that any amendment requiring full border security compliance could fatally undermine the legislation. \"It would mean if one radar is broken then nobody who is already here could get legal status,\" he said. \"It would probably delay for ever anything to bring these people out of the shadows.\" Another Grassley amendment, proposing that Congress rather than the government should determine whether border security was adequate before implementing the bill, saw a similar six v 12 rebellion from Republicans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
