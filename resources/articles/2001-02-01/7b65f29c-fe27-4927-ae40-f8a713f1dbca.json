Yesterday, however, watching him watching his comically miserable team from the bench as they self-destructed in their last plausible chance of salvation this season, well, you couldn't help but wonder. Scratching his ear as the whistles cascaded down, might he have asked himself what on earth he does now? Having finally manipulated the move back to Paris Saint-Germain, the only club in world football he felt would make him truly happy, where he can disappear to the sanctuary of his suburb to be himself every day rather than endure the horrors of London or Madrid, the dream is turning sour. He seldom scores. He endures the embarrassment of being dropped at a club which bills him as the modern icon. His team are in a mother of a mess. Crisis talk was on the tip of every Parisian tongue before Auxerre arrived at the Parc des Princes to knock a club who are languishing in the league, and bottom of their Champions League group, out of the French Cup. Crisis was an inadequate description. Try catastrophe, calamity, cataclysm. PS-G were behind inside 40 seconds. Oh dear. Come one minute 40 seconds they trailed 2-0 after an electric solo goal - the kind Anelka was once famed for - courtesy of the impressive Djibril Ciss\u00e9. Three minutes gone and PS-G fluked a penalty, which Mikael Madar (selected ahead of Anelka) sent with majestic nonchalance towards the corner flag. The locals were beyond fury, and the scathingly sarcastic banner behind the Tribune de Boulogne said it all: 'PS-G: The Benny Hill of football.' Their gallows humour, given their club have spent about \u00a355 million on players this season alone, is the most admirable thing about PS-G. Allez Auxerre urged the rival fans and allez Auxerre did, soaring further ahead. The prodigious Ciss\u00e9, dazzling, dynamic and blessed with killer confidence in front of goal (ring any bells, Nicolas?), scored a memorable fourth. Final score: 0-4. Another banner read: www.Shit Team.Fr , a dig at the fact PS-G conduct themselves more as a business than a club - an imprudent one at that. PS-G are the Inter of French football. Hideous overspending plus underperforming egos equals humiliating malaise. Anelka, being the most lauded and expensive of the lot, sums up their problems. 'He is not a football player any more,' mused one pundit. 'He is more noticeable off the field than on it. We talk about stories, advertising, arguments, but not about great goals.' Understandable, because he doesn't get many (his last came over a month ago). So they make do with tittle tattle, laughing at his indulging in amateur psychology about rumours that he repainted his red Ferarri blue to be more discreet. Fascinating? Not when you don't display style on the pitch to go with it. Worse followed. An unsavoury spat with a local writer who had the temerity to say 'Bonjour' to him at the training ground. Silence. 'I said Bonjour,' added the man from L'Equipe. Silence. The scribe was irked - what's wrong with a little common courtesy? - and told him so. It degenerated until Anelka decided to conclude their repartee with a desultory slap. With the exchange caught on camcorder and reproduced, frame by frame in a newspaper, the petty scandal died down only after his club encouraged Anelka to apologise - nobody really believed it was sincere. It is tiresomely, depressingly, familiar fare. It has all gone pear shaped. Anelka's move for more than \u00a320 million (a far more monstrous sum in France than in the wealthier leagues in Spain, Italy, England) had as much to do with marketing as competing. PS-G's partners, Canal+, stumped up all the cash in a bid to front a new image for the capital's club. Peter Luccin (since demoted to the third team) and Stephane Dalmat (since shipped out to Italy) also arrived from Marseille at significant cost as the club tried to touch base with the young, gifted, and black generation. They adopted the slogan 'Anelka's homecoming' and together with Nike they made a Spike Lee-style rap video to show at the stadium as pre-match entertainment. After a promising start PS-G were top of the league, Anelka was scoring goals, and everything was hunky dory. Then the lack of experience and the president's policy for buying marketable players irrespective of team balance backfired. The sporting director wanted to spend the Anelka money on Wiltord plus a reliable defender but the money men weren't interested. Breaking point arrived with the humiliation of a 5-1 lashing at Sedan. The rap generation, who didn't relate to the uncharismatic manager Philippe Bergeroo anyway, had no inclination to fight for him at all and he was history, to be replaced by the much loved motivator Luis Fernandez, who, coincidentally, had been working for Canal+. Fernandez was a legendary player for PS-G and is from immigrant stock. Surely he would turn things around? Not really. A frantic burst of transfer activity marked his arrival but PS-G remain rudderless. They lie within five points of the relegation zone, and will be out of the Champions League if they fail to win at Milan next week - unlikely. How gratifying can that be for Anelka, a Double winner with Arsenal, before adding a Champions Cup medal with Real and Euro 2000 with his country by the age of 21? He has mustered a mere seven league goals for PS-G. Nine modest French players whose names are barely recognised outside their own towns have struck more prolifically. The player billed as France's final piece of the jigsaw, the attacker they so desperately craved, after a dazzling performance against England at Wembley two years ago now makes it into the squad through name alone. He is nobody's first choice. Unlike Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, he doesn't possess the motivation to refine his game. Can he rediscover the will to improve himself? Doubtful. After explaining on his website that he missed a few games with injury, the doctor insinuated that he could have played had he wanted to. The motto on his personal scarf in the club boutiques proclaims: 'Anelka, proud to be Parisien.' He owes it to the fans, and club, who yearn for him to be their native idol, at least to contemplate whether he is proud of himself at the moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
