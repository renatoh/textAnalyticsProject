The report was commissioned to analyse how factors such as ethnicity, obesity and gender can affect people\u2019s vulnerability to Covid-19 but has already missed the publication deadline set for the end of May. Health bosses sought \u201cinsight\u201d after it was reported that deaths among BAME communities were disproportionately high. \u201cIt is unacceptable that this review should be delayed without a given date for its publication. BAME communities need answers,\u201d said Marsha de Cordova, the shadow women and equalities secretary. Announcing the review\u2019s launch in early May, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cWe recognise that there has been a disproportionately high number of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds who have passed away, especially among care workers and those in the NHS.\u201d On Monday night, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) denied reports the delay was down to official concerns of potential civil unrest linked to global anger over the death of George Floyd, an African American man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck. \u201cMinisters received initial findings today. They are being rapidly considered and a report will be published this week,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Citing an unnamed government source, Sky News had reported that the review\u2019s release had been pushed back because of \u201cworries\u201d around \u201ccurrent global events\u201d. The source was quoted as saying there were concerns in Whitehall about the \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d, where protesters are demanding an end to police violence against black people. The source reportedly said it would be a \u201cbad combination\u201d if the review was released amid such tensions. PHE would initially say only that the \u201creport will be published shortly\u201d. DHSC later added: \u201cIt is not true to say this has been delayed due to global events.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
