Jamie who? GOAL OF THE DAY Brighton\u2019s James Wilson, ruled surplus to requirements at big-scoring Manchester United, went on a fine 30-yard jink to score the day\u2019s finest solo effort. MISS OF THE DAY West Ham\u2019s Mauro Z\u00e1rate made a clinical hash of his opportunity to take all three points at Old Trafford \u2013 six days after bending in an unstoppable free-kick against West Brom. MOST AWKWARD FACT Chelsea\u2019s starting XI yesterday cost a tidy \u00a3210m to assemble, including six players valued at over \u00a320m each. Bournemouth\u2019s entire starting line-up cost less than \u00a31m. BEST REBUTTAL 3-0 down at half-time, Bayern Munich\u2019s official English Twitter feed asked \u201cCan we start the second half again, please?\u201d @borussia_en replied: \u201cNo chance.\u201d DOUBLE TAKE OF THE DAY Twin brothers Will and Michael Keane played against each other at Turf Moor \u2013 with Preston\u2019s Will ghosting past Burnley\u2019s Michael to score the opener.

Others chose to lob the pricy pies at the pitch instead. PLUS: THOUGHT FOR THE DAY BT\u2019s Michael Owen, reflecting on Manchester City\u2019s problem: \u201cWhen they don\u2019t score, they hardly ever win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
