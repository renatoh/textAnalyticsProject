Almost 10 years after publishing its first ethical policy, the Co-op bank plans to update it for the 21st century at a time when two of the pressing issues of the last decade - fur trading and hunting - appear increasingly outdated. In what it terms the biggest ever ethical consultation exercise, the bank plans to send customers a lengthy questionnaire. The bank expects issues such as genetic engineering, animal experimentation, global climate change, human rights and the arms trade to be among issues its customers will want to debate during the exercise which it hopes to complete by May 2002. The Co-op first embarked on such a wide consultation of customers in 1991 which led to the bank pledging not to back a variety of companies, particularly those involved in human rights abuses, the arms trade and animal testing. Because of changes in recent years, the Co-op bank expects new issues to be added to the list of unethical practices by next year. For instance, genetically modified food and genetic engineering of other products is one of the more recent subjects to be thrust on to the agenda. Attempts to ban hunting with hounds and stop trading in furs mean that these may now be on their way off the list of investments to avoid. Some issues are likely to survive, however. \"The arms trade goes on and on and human rights in general,\" a Co-op bank spokesman said. The ethical policy, last updated in 1998, covers more than avoiding business with companies that abuse human rights and animal welfare. It requires the bank to avoid companies which contribute to \"global climate change and acid rain\" as well as avoiding currency speculation which might damage the country's financial health. The Co-op, which believes a third of all new customers join because of its ethical stance, checks potential clients against its ethical policy before lending them money or offering them other financial services. It has not emulated financial firms which run investment funds with an overt ethical stance. But its wide-ranging ethical approach has influenced the way other companies invest money on their customers' behalf. Leading pension funds increasingly have departments responsible for \"socially responsible investment\" , which update investors with an \"ethical audit\" every year. Even the stock exchange is to get a new index which companies can enter only if they meet certain ethical criteria. The FTSE4Good index may help to generate more ethical investment because it will allow big investment firms to set up funds that track the index. Around 60% of companies are expected to qualify for inclusion in the index when it is initiated in July. The Co-op bank insists that its ethical policy cannot be analysed in this way, with companies being barred or included on a rigid blacklist. This is because it only scrutinises potential customers when they approach the bank for financing and does not disclose if it has turned away customers, citing client confidentiality. The Co-op has completed three consultation exercises with its own customers in recent years which illuminate the public's changing passions about certain issues. Ten years ago, financing oppressive regimes and sale of arms to them topped the list of concerns among the Co-op's customers. By 1994, those issues remained important but concerns had increased about animal testing for cosmetic purposes, factory farming and animal fur trade. In 1998, the Co-op found that tobacco manufacturing had slipped back among its customers' concerns. The surveys found, however, a consistent amount of concern about financing oppressive regimes. The bank has also tried to raise new issues during its surveys, such as introducing questions on money laundering in 1994. Answers to questions about currency speculators were measured for the first time in 1998. In the same year, 8% of customers were starting to become aware of genetic modification and raised the issue for inclusion at the next consultation. For the Co-op bank, sending out questionnaires to its 2m customers is the easy part. Getting them to fill them in is harder; in 1998 only 2% participated in the consultation exercise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
