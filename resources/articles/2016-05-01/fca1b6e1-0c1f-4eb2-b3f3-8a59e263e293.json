In November the company said that the dryers, sold under the Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda brands, could be dangerous as they allow lint to build up against the heating element. Some 5.3m dryers were bought in the UK between April 2004 and September 2015. The consumer group said that undercover calls to Whirlpool, a survey of 800 affected customers and analysis of 40 case studies had revealed delays, confusion and the withholding of information. Which? has called on the US company to \u201cclean up its act and treat customers fairly\u201d. Whirlpool staff consistently claimed it would take eight to 12 weeks to first obtain a customer ID \u2013 something Which? believed could be done in seconds \u2013 while almost a third of those who opted for a repair rather than a discounted replacement were told they would have to wait six months or more. Mystery shoppers posing with a nine-month-old dryer were repeatedly told to take up their claims with the retailer. However, many who did so were then told to go back to Whirlpool. Consumers were faced with lengthy delays for a repair, or paying for a replacement at a reduced price. The Which? survey found that 20% said they felt they had no choice but to buy a new machine, while 33% said they would rather pay for a replacement than wait so long for a repair. Just more than half of those surveyed were dissatisfied with Whirlpool\u2019s handling of the situation, rising to 80% for those who had to wait six months or more for a repair. Which? has published the details of all 127 affected models on its website, which Whirlpool has not done \u2013 instead asking consumers to use a model checker on its own website. Which? called on Whirlpool to clearly state the model numbers on the front page of its website along with details of how customers can get help, speed up the customer ID number process, and stop staff directing customers back to retailers. Whirlpool said that publishing model numbers \u201crisks confusing consumers\u201d and directed them to a model checker at here and here, or on 0800 151 0905. Which? director of policy and campaigns Alex Neill said: \u201cWhirlpool must clean up their act and sort this mess out. This case, affecting millions, clearly highlights the problems with the current product safety regulations. The government must act swiftly to simplify the system and close the loopholes that allow companies to leave consumers without the basic information and advice they need.\u201d Whirlpool said it was looking at ways of speeding up the repair programme and said consumers could keep using their dryers in the meantime. However, the dryers should not be left unattended while running \u201cas an extra precaution\u201d. \u201cAdditionally, consumers should check and clean the filter after every cycle and ensure proper dryer venting, as directed in the original operating manual.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
