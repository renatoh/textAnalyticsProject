Victoria\u2019s voluntary assisted dying laws came into force last week. The state health department has scrambled to contact the 175 doctors who have trained to participate, warning them they must meet patients in person to avoid potentially breaching a 2005 commonwealth law against inciting suicide through a carriage service. The offence attracts a fine of 1,000 penalty units or $210,000 but there has never been a single prosecution since it has been on the statute books. The state health minister, Jenny Mikakos, on Wednesday announced updated legal advice that consultations via electronic means such as phones and video conferencing could be legally problematic. She said Victoria was effectively \u201cworking around the commonwealth law\u201d and she doubted any \u201cfederal prosecutor worth their salt\u201d would be pursuing it. \u201cNo one at the commonwealth level had envisaged a state parliament actually introducing voluntary assisted dying laws,\u201d she told reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday. \u201cThe risk to our clinicians \u2026 is a negligible one. But I want to ensure that there is no risk to anybody.\u201d Mikakos believes no legislative amendments will be required to the state law. The only practical implication was for people based in regional Victoria, she said. \u201cWe will assist doctors to travel to regional Victoria, to make sure they can do those face-to-face consultations,\u201d Mikakos said. Asked if family members should avoid discussing the issue by phone with terminally ill loved ones, Mikakos said it would be an \u201cabsurdity\u201d that the commonwealth law could apply in that scenario. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter I think is a real risk,\u201d she said. Victoria\u2019s parliament passed the voluntary assisted dying legislation in November 2017, after a conscience vote and a marathon parliamentary debate lasting about 100 hours. Mikakos said the interaction between this legislation and the commonwealth law didn\u2019t come up during the passage of the laws through state parliament. She declined to provide a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the number of applications from people who are terminally ill. Last week there were reports of 100 inquiries. The Western Australian Labor government has announced plans for similar laws to Victoria, while an inquiry is underway in Queensland. Meanwhile, the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory are fighting to regain the power to legislate on the issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
