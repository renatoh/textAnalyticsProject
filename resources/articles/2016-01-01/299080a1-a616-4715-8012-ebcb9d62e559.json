These days Stoke City attract players from Barcelona, the Midlands club have even started to play like the Spanish giants in some people\u2019s eyes \u2013 \u201cStokealona\u201d is the moniker that Bojan Krkic, Xherdan Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic have brought to the Potteries \u2013 and the weather is no longer cold, wet and windy and a key part of their armoury. Mark Hughes, who is the man responsible for leading the revolution (climate change apart), has exceeded all expectations at Stoke, which is a club that sees itself as finishing between eighth and 14th in the Premier League and having a tilt at a cup every few years. The problem, however, with building up such a sense of excitement among supporters and rekindling memories of the team that brought Stoke their only major trophy, back in 1972, is that the comedown is so much harder to stomach when things fail to come off. This ended up being one of those desperately frustrating evenings for Stoke, who flattered to deceive against a Liverpool side that played as if hell-bent on flushing that spineless defeat at West Ham on Saturday out of their system. Stoke, quite simply, never really got going and it was hard to reconcile their prosaic, flat display with the exhilarating performances that the home supporters have been treated to in the last month or so, when Manchester City and Manchester United have been humbled. So much of the pre-match talk had focused on that exciting Bojan, Shaqiri, Arnautovic trident, which has illuminated the Premier League in recent weeks with their box of tricks, yet this was not a night that will live long in the memory for any of them. Bojan was withdrawn after 72 minutes, Shaqiri was peripheral and the reaction when Arnautovic was announced as the man of the match over the public address in the closing minutes was one of bemusement. Even then there was still time for Jonathan Walters, who was introduced at half-time as Hughes turned to the old guard to inject fresh life into his struggling team, to break through in the inside-left channel, but the low poorly hit shot that slid well beyond Simon Mignolet\u2019s far upright was rather symptomatic of Stoke\u2019s night. Scowling as he prowled the touchline, Hughes looked like a man struggling to make sense of what he was seeing at times. The Welshman has been such a breath of fresh air at the club, restoring his own reputation as a manager after the debacle at Queens Park Rangers and transforming Stoke\u2019s at the same time. Peter Coates, the club\u2019s 78-year-old chairman, went as far as to say on the eve of the game this was the best Stoke side he has ever seen, eclipsing the team that won the League Cup 44 years ago, yet this was not the occasion to put that theory to the test. Hughes expressed his frustration with the referee for his timekeeping afterwards but, deep down, the manager will know Stoke\u2019s problems were more of their own doing. They were uncharacteristically careless in possession and even the well-rehearsed training ground set-piece routines failed to come off. Krkic, picked out by Shaqiri\u2019s clever corner kick, horribly miskicked from 12 yards during a first half when Stoke seemed taken aback by the intensity with which Liverpool started the game. Twice in that period Ryan Shawcross came to their rescue, making last-ditch challenges to rob first Philippe Coutinho and then Roberto Firmino. Jack Butland had already denied Adam Lallana by that point with a one-handed save and there was a sense of inevitability that Liverpool would eventually break through. Jordon Ibe, an early replacement for the hamstrung Coutinho, duly delivered after Liverpool raided Stoke\u2019s left flank, where Erik Pieters was left badly exposed. Stoke improved in the second half but there was still an overwhelming sense of anti-climax come the end. Hughes had talked beforehand about there being \u201ca possibility we could take this tie away from Liverpool in the first instance\u201d, which seemed perfectly plausible at the time, yet the Stoke manager finished the game relieved that the tie was still alive. Liverpool, on another day, could have put the game out of sight. Whether that realisation comes back to bite J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s players in the second leg at Anfield remains to be seen. What can be said with certainty is that Stoke are capable of playing so much better and, as they demonstrated in their 4-3 win at Goodison Park a couple of weeks ago, wreaking havoc away from home. Perhaps the stage is still set for Krkic, Shaqiri and Arnautovic to prove Coates right and for Hughes to rekindle his own hopes of winning a first trophy as a manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
