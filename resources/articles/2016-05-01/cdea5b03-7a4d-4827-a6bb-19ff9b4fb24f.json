It has calculated the total on the basis of official figures, answers to parliamentary questions and previous costs of items including nuclear warheads and decommissioning nuclear reactors. It says it has not taken into account that past Ministry of Defence projects have frequently gone well over budget. The government is expected soon to ask MPs to vote to replace the existing Trident fleet with four new nuclear submarines. The MoD has already spent nearly \u00a34bn on the replacement programme. Last month, it declined to say how much it thought it would cost to replace Trident, and the ministry said the situation has not changed. \u201cThe government needs a safe space away from the public gaze to allow it to consider policy options for delivering the deterrent in the most cost-effective way, unfettered from public comment about the affordability of particular policy options,\u201d it said in response to a freedom of information request from Reuters. In its strategic defence and security review at the end of last year, the government announced an increase from \u00a325bn in the estimated cost of four new Trident submarines to \u00a331bn, with an additional \u00a310bn to cover overspends. The Blair government\u2019s 2006 white paper on the future of the UK\u2019s nuclear deterrent said leasing the Trident missiles from the US until the early 2040s would cost \u00a3250m \u2013 or \u00a3350m in today\u2019s prices, according to CND. The white paper said Britain\u2019s nuclear warheads would last into the 2020s but added that \u00a33bn would be set aside to refurbish or replace the existing stockpile. That is equivalent to \u00a34bn in today\u2019s prices, says CND. A further \u00a33bn (equivalent to \u00a34bn) has been allocated for new infrastructure work at Faslane and Coulport bases. The most expensive item would be the cumulative running costs, estimated by the government to be about 6% of the total defence budget. Crispin Blunt, Tory chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, has calculated, on the basis of parliamentary answers, that a new Trident system would cost \u00a3167bn over a 30-year lifespan. The cost of conventional naval forces tasked with supporting Trident was estimated in 2007 by the then government to be about \u00a330m a year. That would total more than \u00a31bn over the lifetime of the new Trident fleet, according to CND. It says that while it is difficult to know how much decommissioning existing nuclear-powered Trident submarines would cost, judging by the government\u2019s estimated spending on decommissioning Polaris, Britain\u2019s previous nuclear weapons system, the cost of disposing the existing Trident fleet would be at least \u00a313bn in today\u2019s prices. About \u00a320bn is also being spent on the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Aldermaston, where the warheads are manufactured and maintained, between 2000 and 2025. . Kate Hudson, CND general secretary, said: \u201cThese new calculations, drawn from actual government figures, show that the bill has spiralled beyond all expectations.\u201d She added: \u201c\u00a3205 billion of public money is a huge amount. Pouring it into a nuclear weapons system that experts say could be rendered obsolete by new technology is hardly a wise choice. Far better to spend it on industrial regeneration, building homes, tackling climate change or meeting our defence needs in usable ways.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
