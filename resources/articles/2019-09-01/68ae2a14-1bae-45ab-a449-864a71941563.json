In an explosion of the youth movement started by the Swedish school striker Greta Thunberg just over 12 months ago, people protested from the Pacific islands, through Australia, across-south east Asia and Africa into Europe and onwards to the Americas. For the first time since the school strikes for climate began last year, young people called on adults to join them \u2013 and they were heard. Trade unions representing hundreds of millions of people around the world mobilised in support, employees left their workplaces, doctors and nurses marched and workers at firms like Amazon, Google and Facebook walked out to join the climate strikes. In the estimated 185 countries where demonstrations took place, the protests often had their individual targets; from rising sea levels in the Solomon Islands, toxic waste in South Africa, to air pollution and plastic waste in India and coal expansion in Australia. But the overall message was unified \u2013 a powerful demand for an urgent step-change in action to cut emissions and stabilise the climate. The demonstrations took place on the eve of a UN climate summit, called by the secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, to inject urgency into government action to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C, as agreed under the 2015 Paris agreement. Carbon emissions climbed to a record high last year, despite a warning from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that there is little more than a decade left to act to slash emissions and stabilise the climate. Donald Trump will be at the UN headquarters during Monday\u2019s key summit on the climate crisis \u2013 but will be there to take part in a meeting on religious freedom instead, in what will be seen by many as a snub. On Friday, the voices of key political leaders were noticeable by their absence. Instead it was a day for people to set forth their demands, ranging from a ban on new mining in countries like South Africa and Australia, to a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d in the UK and US to better air quality and more trees in countries like India. \u201cWe are out here to reclaim our right to live, our right to breathe and our right to exist, which is all being denied to us by an inefficient policy system that gives more deference to industrial and financial objectives rather than environmental standards,\u201d said Aman Sharma, a young protester in Delhi. Asia-Pacific The action began in the Pacific Islands, where citizens have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels. Over the course of the day children and students from Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Tonga, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea took part in poetry performances, silent protests, sporting events and discussions. Students held placards in Kiribati and chanted: \u201cWe are not sinking, we are fighting.\u201d The demonstrations spread across Australia \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas \u2013 where more than 300,000 people took to the streets in 100 rallies, prompting a tweet from Thunberg \u2013 awake in New York \u2013 that the \u201chuge crowd\u201d would set the standard. The Australian finance minister, Mathias Cormann, had said on Thursday that students should stay in class rather than go on strike. In a retort, Danielle Porepilliasana, a Sydney high school student said: \u201cWorld leaders from everywhere are telling us that students need to be at school doing work. I\u2019d like to see them at their parliaments doing their jobs for once.\u201d In Tokyo, hundreds of students and environmental activists marched through the business and shopping district of Shibuya, chanting \u201cClimate Justice!\u201d while holding hand-painted placards made of cardboard with messages such as \u201cGo Green,\u201d \u2018\u2018Save the Earth,\u201d and \u201cthe Earth is on fire.\u201d Smaller rallies were held in more than a dozen cities around Japan, including Kyoto. No protests were authorised in China, the world\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but Zheng Xiaowen of the China Youth Climate Action Network said Chinese youth would take action one way or another. \u201cChinese youth have their own methods,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also pay attention to the climate and we are also thinking deeply, interacting, taking action, and so many people are very conscientious on this issue.\u201d There was action, however, in Taiwan, where dozens of representatives from primary schools, high schools, and universities gathered in the capital, Taipei, to launch a petition to press candidates in the upcoming presidential election to lay out concrete policies to mitigate climate change risks. In Thailand, hundreds of young people demonstrated outside the environment ministry in Bangkok and dropped to the ground feigning death. \u201cWe are the future and we deserve better,\u201d said 12-year-old Ralyn \u2018Lilly\u2019 Satidtanasarn \u2013 who has been dubbed \u201cThailand\u2019s Greta\u201d for her campaign against plastic bag use in a country where each person uses 3,000 throwaway bags a year. In India\u2019s capital Delhi, where the suffocating air pollution was the target of the demonstration, Rishika Singh, 18, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the poorest who suffer the most. The rich are better off \u2013 they make the use of air conditioning and private cars for comfort.\u201d An armoured personnel carrier was deployed in the Afghan capital, Kabul, to protect about 100 young people as they marched, led by a group of young women carrying a banner emblazoned with \u201cFridays for Future\u201d. Fardeen Barakzai, one of the organisers and head of the local climate activist group, Oxygen, said: \u201dWe want to do our part. We as the youth of our country know the problem of climate change.\u201d Africa In Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi some young protesters wore hats and outfits made from plastic bottles to highlight the dangers of plastic waste, a major threat to people living in the developing world. Strikes took place in several Nigerian cities, including Lagos, which is often beset by formidable quantities of toxic waste including thousands of tons of e-waste from the EU. \u201cLeaders should listen to what the climate scientists are saying. No leader should forfeit the future of younger generation,\u201d said Oladosu Adenike, an activist in the Fridays4Future campaign in Nigeria. A small but noisy crowd gathered in the financial district of Sandton in Johannesburg, outside the offices of Sasol, a huge South African energy and chemical company. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a way out of this,\u201d said Natalie Kapsosideris, 16. \u201cThe future looks really dismal at this point. There\u2019s not going to be a lot of food available, there will be droughts, floods, natural disasters. The fact that Sasol gets away with stealing our future from us \u2026 and it\u2019s all because they want to make money.\u201d Europe Demonstrations took place in most European countries, with huge crowds in Warsaw, Poland and more than 1.4 million people taking action across Germany. In Berlin, demonstrators blocked roads and protested outside the German chancellery. In response, Angela Merkel announced a \u20ac50bn package of new measures to curb carbon emissions and review progress towards reaching its climate goals by 2030. Merkel said that as a scientist she had been impressed by Thunberg\u2019s motto \u201cunite behind the science\u201d. \u201cThe chances are very good, they have grown, that we will reach our climate goals this time,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cIf we should realise we\u2019re not on track, then we will correct this.\u201d In Brussels one rather poetic placard read: \u201cRespect existence or Expect resistance!\u201d Thousands took to the streets in Dublin. Luke Corkery, a university student, said in a tweet: \u201cBlown away \u2026 This is a movement led by young people across the globe. We\u2019re not just looking for an excuse for a day off school or college; we\u2019re standing up for the future of our planet.\u201d Americas The global protest culminated in New York which was anticipating one of the largest climate strikes. Education chiefs in the city gave every one of the 1.1 million children in its schools permission to attend the climate strike and hear Thunberg speak at a rally at the United Nations headquarters. \u201cGreta! Greta! Greta!\u201d the crowd chanted as she took to the stage. The 16-year-old directed her speech to the students in the crowd, though she acknowledged that adults also skipped worked to strike. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse, even if it means skipping school or work, because this is more important,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy should we study for a future that is being taken away from us?\u201d She sparked laughter when she described all the politicians she had met who asked for selfies and \u201ctell us they really, really admire what we do\u201d yet have done nothing to address the climate crisis. \u201cWe demand a safe future. Is that really to much to ask?\u201d It was estimated that more than 250,000 people turned out for the protests in New York, with thousands more demonstrating in Boston, Miami and San Francisco. In Mexico City, protesters chanted \u201cSe ve, se siente, la tierra est\u00e1 caliente\u201d \u2013 \u201cYou see it, you feel it. The earth is getting hotter.\u201d In Brazil, where recent fires in the Amazon have drawn attention to the climate emergency, students attended protests in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and the capital Bras\u00edlia. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 September 2019.
