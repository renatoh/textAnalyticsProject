For Gareth Southgate, though, the plan for the European Under-21 Championships is a specific one that involves neither baked-bean embargoes nor commandments pinned to the wall. Southgate\u2019s side face Belarus at Oakwell on Thursday in their final warmup before flying out to the Czech Republic for a tournament in which hopes of success are high and the head coach believes he has found the right balance for his young side. \u201cWe\u2019ve had lads like Tom Ince in the squad and they\u2019re dads,\u201d he said. \u201cSo although it\u2019s a young team I think we\u2019ve got to give them responsibility. This group have never betrayed that responsibility so I don\u2019t have a load of rules but they know that they\u2019ve got to be respectful \u2013 that means being on time for things, very straightforward. \u201cBut I think when you have lists of rules and fines \u2013 No1 someone\u2019s got to collect the bloody things so that\u2019s a problem in itself and No2 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s discipline actually. That\u2019s just putting rules up. It looks like discipline but actually it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d England\u2019s tournament gets underway against Portugal in Uherske Hradiste next Thursday before games against Sweden and Italy in Olomouc. An unbeaten qualification stage \u2013 which included 11 wins in 12 games \u2013 coupled with friendly victories over the Portuguese and the tournament favourites Germany, not to mention the surprise absence of big beasts such as France and Spain, means Southgate\u2019s side go into the tournament with their sights set very much on the latter stages. Lifting the trophy, though, is not the be-all and end-all. \u201cI\u2019ve said to them that we know internally what our objective is and what we believe we can do, but it should be a good life experience for them as well,\u201d he said. \u201cFor them something like this is going to be different and I want them to embrace that and get used to that because this is part of the preparation for going in to the seniors. So take all of it in, absorb it. \u201cWe\u2019re staying in an area that\u2019s far enough out of town that we\u2019re not going to be swamped. But they can walk in to town, they can go and have a coffee, they can go and meet local people or if their families are over I want them to be able to come to the hotel and see them at the right times. Because they\u2019re also young lads and being away from home for some might be a challenge. I\u2019ve no reason over the last 18 months not to be that way with them.\u201d Harry Kane became the final member of the 23-man squad to join up with his team-mates at St George\u2019s Park on Tuesday following Tottenham\u2019s games in Malaysia and Sydney. He is unlikely to start at Oakwell so the Liverpool-bound Danny Ings or West Bromwich Albion\u2019s Saido Berahino will fill the No9 role against Belarus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
