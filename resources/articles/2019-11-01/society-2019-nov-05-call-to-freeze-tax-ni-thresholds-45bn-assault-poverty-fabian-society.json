The Fabian Society, which is affiliated to the Labour party, said a range of working-age and child benefits should be raised by \u00a35 a week as an emergency measure in the first year of the next government. It said immediate post-election action needed to be part of a long-term strategy designed to end in-work poverty by the conclusion of the next parliament. Andrew Harrop, the thinktank\u2019s general secretary and author of the report, said: \u201cThe UK is scarred by poverty and our social security system is in crisis, with 15 million people expected to live in poverty next year. At the 2017 election none of the political parties presented credible plans for reducing poverty so this time it must be different.\u201d Labour\u2019s proposals for tackling poverty in its 2017 election manifesto were criticised for failing to reverse the Conservatives\u2019 benefit cuts, and the Fabian report responds to calls for a more radical approach. The thinktank said ministers should broaden the \u201ctriple lock\u201d \u2013 which means the state pension increases in line with prices, earnings or 2.5% \u2013 to include all age groups. The Fabians said there should be a fiscal rule requiring the government to report on the cost of tax allowances and social security in a single new account, to bring transparency to the financial support provided to different households through tax and benefit policies combined. Harrop said a long-term plan was needed to create a far more generous social security system that was less dependent on a single means-tested household benefit, the much criticised universal credit. A future government should sign up for ambitious goals \u2013 ending in-work poverty in five years and child poverty within a decade \u2013 and then redesign benefits to achieve them, he said. \u201cThe next government must promise both a 10-year strategy for long-term social security reform and a one-year rescue plan to solve the worst failings of the system now. The parties\u2019 election manifestos should promise a \u00a35 per week increase in key benefits for children and working-age adults. \u201cPoliticians should also set out their ambitions for longer-term change with present credible plans to end poverty for children and working households over five to 10 years.\u201d The Fabian report said the cost of its programme would be \u00a36.5bn in the first year, rising to \u00a345bn in 2023-24. Of this, \u00a325bn would come from returning welfare spending as a share of GDP to its 2015-16 level and the other \u00a320bn from freezing national insurance contributions (NIC) and income tax thresholds. \u201cBillions of pounds could be pumped into social security by freezing the value of tax-free allowances,\u201d Harrop said. \u201cNo one would see their take-home pay fall but over time cash would gradually be shifted from poorly targeted tax giveaways to payments for those in greatest need.\u201d With an election only five weeks away, Labour gave the report a guarded welcome, focusing on the party\u2019s plans to abolish universal credit rather than the report\u2019s most politically charged recommendation \u2013 the freezing of NIC and income tax allowances to pay for anti-poverty measures. Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cThis Fabian report shows clearly how our social security system has lost its way. Rather than lifting people out of poverty, punitive policies are causing severe hardship. \u201cNothing illustrates that more clearly than the way that universal credit fails to take account of the realities of people\u2019s lives, with a five-week wait that leaves people in debt and drives up food bank use. \u201cLabour will scrap universal credit, end the five-week wait and suspend the sanctions regime to ensure that our social security system treats people with respect and protects people from poverty as it should.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
