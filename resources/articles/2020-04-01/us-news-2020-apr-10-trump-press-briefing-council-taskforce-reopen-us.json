Facing criticism from traditional allies over his often combative daily coronavirus taskforce briefings, the president adopted a more emollient demeanour during Friday\u2019s marathon two-hour-plus session. Trump and his public health experts pointed to hopeful signs that the spread of the coronavirus could be slowing and the final death toll lower than once projected. This had fuelled reports that Trump is set to shift focus and appoint an economic taskforce. \u201cThis is beyond economic,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI call it the \u2018opening our country taskforce\u2019 or \u2018opening our country council\u2019 so we don\u2019t get it confused with Mike\u2019s [Pence] taskforce, which has done so great. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have the great business leaders, the great doctors, we\u2019re going to have a group of people. We\u2019ll probably do it by teleconference because we don\u2019t really want them travelling in for their own purposes. I don\u2019t think it would look good, also.\u201d Trump added: \u201cI want to get it open as soon as possible. This country was meant to be open and vibrant and great \u2026 The facts are going to determine what I do. But we do want to get the country open.\u201d He promised the council will be announced on Tuesday \u201cwith names that you have a lot of respect for, a lot of great names, different businesses, different people \u2026 I want their views on what they think\u201d. Media reports suggest the council could include his daughter Ivanka Trump; the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin; and the new White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. The current \u201cstop the spread\u201d federal guidelines finish on 30 April and pressure is building on Trump to reopen at least parts of the economy, which has gone into free fall and shed more jobs than in the 2008-09 Great Recession. But with infections approaching half a million, public health experts fear that pushing too soon could result in a second wave of cases. America has tested less than 1% of its population, leaving it way behind other nations on testing per capita, yet Trump dismissed questions on this issue. Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned on Friday: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the levelling off \u2026 but it\u2019s important to remember that this is not the time to feel that since we have made such an important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation that we need to be pulling back at all.\u201d Dr Deborah Birx, the response coordinator, added that as encouraging as the signs are, \u201cwe have not reached the peak, and so every day we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that, because that\u2019s what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side\u201d. Trump promised to heed the experts. \u201cI listen to them about everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re actually surprised. I have great respect for these people \u2026 We\u2019re not doing anything until we know that this country is going be healthy. We don\u2019t want to go back and start doing it over again.\u201d He acknowledged: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve had a bigger decision. But I\u2019m going to surround myself with the greatest minds. Not only the greatest minds, but the greatest minds in numerous different businesses, including the business of politics and reason.\u201d A reporter asked what metrics would be used to help Trump decide. He pointed to his head. Later he added: \u201cI have a big decision coming up, and I only hope to God that\u2019s it\u2019s the right decision.\u201d Trump\u2019s bombastic TV briefings have been compared to campaign rallies but normally supportive sources such as the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham and the Wall Street Journal newspaper have warned that they are doing him more harm than good. Perhaps stung, he reshuffled the order of speakers on Friday and adopted a more genial tone. \u201cOK, it\u2019s Good Friday so let\u2019s be nice,\u201d Trump said as he invited questions. But he could not resist sparring with CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, an old foe, who asked: \u201cWe hear from a lot of people who see these briefings as sort of \u2018happy talk\u2019 briefings. And some of the officials paint as rosy a picture of what is happening around the country. If you look at some of these questions \u2013 do we have enough masks? No. Do we have enough tests? No. Do we have enough PPE? No.\u201d Trump snapped: \u201cA lot of it is fake news \u2026 This is not happy talk. Maybe it is happy talk for you. It is not happy talk for me. We\u2019re talking about the greatest economy in the world, one day I have to close it off. And we did the right thing because maybe it would have been 2 million people died.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is sad talk \u2026 These are the saddest news conferences that I have ever had. I don\u2019t like doing them. You know why? Because I am talking about death.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
