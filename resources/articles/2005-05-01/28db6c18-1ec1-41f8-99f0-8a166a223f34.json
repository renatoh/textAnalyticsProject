Now the Guardian has obtained what appears to be a transcript of the new owner's speech to his players on the eve of the team's FA Cup final match against Arsenal this afternoon. I'm delighted to give you boys a pep talk before the big game. Winning the FA Superbowl will mean a lot to me. I want you to know, I'm a real big fan of Manchester University, and I've been following your results very closely. Financial results, mainly. But since getting involved with the club, the first thing I do every morning is turn straight to the back of the newspaper - that's where the FT prints the share prices. Of course Manchester is famous around the world. Think of all the great names that have appeared on a United shirt - household names like Sharp, Vodafone and Nike. But you've had some pretty good players too, guys like George West, Bobbie Charleston, and that manager Sir Maz Buttby. We need to commemorate those greats. Like, I'm thinking of opening a new donut stand here, and calling it Dunkin' Edwards. Something tasteful like that. With great players, you've had some great seasons. Who can forget 1999 and the \"treble\": turnover up 26%, income through the \u00a3100m barrier, and record dividends! My accountants really love those highlights. And you also beat the Bayern Munichs to win the European Union, which was a bonus, huh? Great players, great results, and don't forget the greatest fans in the world. They'd give everything for this club - and after our next bunch of ticket price rises, many of them will have to. I know you're worried about what the situation is with the manager. Let me reassure you, I know all about Fergie's achievements - I've seen her Weight Watchers ads on TV, and read about her divorce from Prince Charles. But it's great that you've had a woman manager. I say, let's hear it for Dame Fergie. Now, I haven't made up my mind about whether or not to keep Fergie, or hire a new boss. People say this guy Alan Sugar is the hottest manager around right now, so I'll talk to Sir Sugar and see what we can run up the ballpark. But I'm worried he's too soft on the money side. OK, I know you've all got questions, but you foreign players have to get a better grip on English. You got this captain Roy Keane, who had a few words with me but I didn't understand any of them. Something about sticking up a bullock. Why does everyone keep calling the Dutch kid rude? He seems real polite to me. Let's show respect to foreign people. We got players from all over the place. We got a guy who's a Frenchman, we got a guy who's Welsh, and heck we've got this kid Wayne Rooney, who everyone says is a Chav. Anyway, I've done research about Roy Keane. He's given this club great service, although I see he hasn't hit any home runs this season. But I like his interest in what the fans eat, so I'm promoting him to be head of catering. See, Roy's so enthusiastic that he's leaving right away. Fix us up some of your famous shrimp sandwiches, Roy! Let's talk about my vision for this club. People have been saying, hot diggity, we've qualified for Europe. But I say, why are we kidding around with some chicken-shit European league. Why haven't we qualified for the World Series? Hey look, Roy's back! Got an update on your prawn recipes? Sorry Roy, I couldn't catch that, apart from all the Jesus. Do you want to lead us in prayer? Now, son, put that chair down, I'll talk about furnishings in good time ... [muffled sounds, tape ends]"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
