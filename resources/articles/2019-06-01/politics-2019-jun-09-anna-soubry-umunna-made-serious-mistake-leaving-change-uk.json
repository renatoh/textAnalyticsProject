Soubry, the Broxtowe MP who is now leader of the remaining five, said Change UK, formed after she and two other ex-Tory MPs followed a breakaway group of Labour backbenchers, had been plagued by internal disagreements. \u201cThese things are always difficult, but some people weren\u2019t even in the same book, never mind on the same page,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say they didn\u2019t have huge strengths. But when there are 11 of you, you sometimes have to shut up and get on with it. \u201cAnd the idea that you can agree a strategy and then constantly question it, debate it \u2013 sometimes you have to say, can we just stop talking and do some frigging campaigning?\u201d Heidi Allen, Change UK\u2019s interim leader, also left on Tuesday. Others who left to sit as independents were another ex-Conservative, Sarah Wollaston, and the former Labour MPs Luciana Berger, Gavin Shuker and Angela Smith. Those remaining with Soubry are Mike Gapes, Chris Leslie, Joan Ryan and Ann Coffey, all of whom formerly represented Labour. Soubry said she was particularly stricken by Umunna\u2019s decision. \u201cI will always be more sad than you can imagine that Chuka is not with us. I think he\u2019s a man of huge ability and talents, and I think he has made a very serious mistake. \u201cWith the five of us, who knows what\u2019s going to happen? But you can\u2019t give up at the first hurdle. You just don\u2019t. Especially when some of that was circumstances over which you had no control. But when there are circumstances over which you do have control you do not behave in the way that, I\u2019m afraid, some of those six did behave.\u201d Over little more than three months Change UK was buffeted by both difficult political fortunes \u2013 in last month\u2019s European election it took just 3% of the vote \u2013 as well as public bickering over tactics, for example about tactical voting and whether to pursue a merger with the Liberal Democrats. But insiders say the disagreements were even more heated behind closed doors, punctuated by differences over leadership arrangements, threats to quit the party and lack of agreement over even the basics of the party\u2019s future direction. Some of the reported disputes bordered on farce, such as the party almost missing a print deadline for its European election leaflets because one MP wanted a different photograph, and official social media feeds being stopped at the instructions of one member, and then tacitly resumed by another. Meanwhile, sources amid those who quit argue that Soubry and Leslie \u2013 whose spouses are respectively treasurer and chief executive of the party \u2013 sought to run Change UK \u201clike a Soviet state\u201d. Soubry says she will stay as leader until an autumn conference, and has ruled out any idea of joining up with the Lib Dems. The split was clear, Soubry said, when Umunna told her he did not think Change UK should continue as a formal party. \u201cI said to him: the movement\u2019s out there, we just need to build a home for that movement, a political party. When he decided that he believed we should not stand candidates I was beyond even disappointed,\u201d she said. \u201cI believed in him, and believed he should be prime minister of our country. He was a major part of why I left the Conservative party. And here we were, having had a very difficult time, and obviously a disappointing set of election results. \u201cBut hell, 600,000 people voted for us, and we\u2019d found 69 candidates, many of whom have got more ability in their little fingers than some MPs across the whole of the chamber. Some seriously brilliant people.\u201d The five remaining MPs were \u201cabsolutely on the same page\u201d, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got decades of experience between us. We\u2019re now going to turn our attention on building a membership-based party, and of equal importance we\u2019ve already started the work on formulating policies. That\u2019s already begun.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
