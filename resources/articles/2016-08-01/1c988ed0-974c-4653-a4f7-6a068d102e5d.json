Speaking in the buildup to the season\u2019s opening match, the champions\u2019 trip to Hull City on Saturday lunchtime, Ranieri was in characteristically gnomic form, insisting he expects the big clubs to return to form and that his side\u2019s first ambition is to avoid relegation. He also said Riyad Mahrez would be staying, joking that he would kill the Algerian before letting him leave. \u201cI work to be safe,\u201d the manager said in a revival of the mantra he used last season even when his Foxes were top of the league. \u201cI say to my fans: \u2018We want to be safe, to build a team, anything more and that\u2019s fantastic.\u2019 It\u2019s not normal that we can win the league. It\u2019s more difficult than last season. It\u2019s easier that ET comes to Piccadilly Circus.\u201d Ranieri continued in the same vein by insisting bookmakers should price his side at even longer odds for the title than the now famous 5,000-1 offered this time last year. But the 64-year-old also had words for his rivals before the season kicks off. \u201cI think the bookies have to pay 6,000-1 now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are ready to defend our title but we know it is a different gap. The big teams will be back, I am sure. They can\u2019t make the same mistake for another year. They lost one season in the life of a big team. There are five, six teams who can win it this year. It will be a good fight.\u201d The former Chelsea manager pointed to last weekend\u2019s Community Shield, in which Leicester lost 2-1 to Manchester United, as an example of the gulf between his club and more familiar title challengers. \u201cI believe big clubs have more quality, more than us, but we are a team,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, on Sunday we lost a match. We were a team but Ibrahimovic was there and we lost. I want our players to fight and to show their best qualities. Then, if there is a champion who can invent something, what can we do? This is why I say the other teams are fantastic champions who cost a lot of money but we have to stay a team.\u201d One of the players whose quality decided the league in Leicester\u2019s favour last season was Mahrez. He has been the subject of constant transfer speculation this summer but Ranieri continued to talk tough over the winger. \u201cCould you tell me who is interested in him?\u201d he asked when the subject was raised. \u201cNo, not Arsenal. We\u2019ve had no bids. I think it\u2019s not a problem. It\u2019s a process to improve his career. The Champions League is very different to the Premier League and he can improve with us. Riyad stays with us. Never never never has he come to me and said \u2018I want to go\u2019 because I\u2019d kill him before he does.\u201d At this point Ranieri mimicked choking an insubordinate Mahrez. \u201cHe\u2019s a lucky man,\u201d he said. While Ranieri seeks to lower expectations on his outperforming squad, he is also setting new plans in place. He has spent \u00a340m in the transfer window recruiting, among others, the defensive midfielder Nampalys Mendy and the pacey Nigerian striker Ahmed Musa, a player he likened to Jamie Vardy. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have another player who can play in a similar way to Jamie,\u201d Ranieri said of Musa. \u201cHe can play in a similar way but also together with Jamie. It\u2019s important to have good options so I can choose the XI, but also so that during the match I can read it and think: \u2018Oh, I need this kind of player with this quality.\u2019 \u201cTo have pace in the side is not my only priority. I want to play well, to score a goal, not concede a goal, have a good balance on the pitch, lots of things. Of course if you have a good player with lots of pace it\u2019s a good thing but other teams have that too. It\u2019s a different league that the new signings are coming from. They have to understand the Premier League. I hope they understand very soon.\u201d Ranieri admits he will need a Plan B to outwit opposition who come to the King Power Stadium with the sole intention of going home with a point: \u201cIt could be that I change something in the team.\u201d He will also, however, have to deal with the demands of at least six midweek Champions League games. \u201cI hope we are ready. I want to make a good experience in the Champions League,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not possible to make the knockout stages, we want to make the Europa League \u2026 It will be a good experience and we will get a lot of good mental energy. We are not used to the routine of Champions League and Premier League, Champions League and Premier League, and in the beginning when you are not used to it, you lose a little more in the league. That\u2019s why I am curious to see how it goes. It\u2019s not easy to play in four competitions.\u201d Those competitions begin on Saturday. Hull are newly promoted and without a manager after the resignation of Steve Bruce but Ranieri wryly observed his next opponents were not to be taken lightly. \u201cBe careful with people when they\u2019re favourites for relegation,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
