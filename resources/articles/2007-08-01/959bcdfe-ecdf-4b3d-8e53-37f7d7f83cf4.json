Online networking phenomenon Facebook has emerged as the venue for a rapidly proliferating campaign that has already brought in thousands of recent graduates. It's called \"Stop the Great HSBC Graduate Rip-Off!\" Students with HSBC bank accounts, graduating this summer, have been astonished to discover they face unexpected bills of up to \u00a3140 a year for running an overdraft after the bank withdrew its interest-free deal in July. In previous years HSBC, like other high street banks, has allowed students an interest-free overdraft - typically up to \u00a31,500-\u00a32,000 - for the first couple of years after graduation. But in July it became the first high street bank to scrap free overdrafts for university leavers. It charges interest at 9.9%. But HSBC didn't reckon on a cyber-rebellion, begun by Wes Streeting, a Cambridge NUS vice-president opening up the Facebook group. Over the past few weeks it has exploded, with more than 2,500 graduates signed up and dozens more joining every day. The group's \"wall\" contains hundreds of angry postings. Typical is this one from a student at Hertfordshire University: \"I have closed my account [at HSBC] . . . and paid my overdraft with an interest-free account! The charges r crazy . . . how r we ever supposed to get outta debt after uni!\" Leeds University graduate Johnny Chatterton first heard about the overdraft charge via Facebook. \"When I first went to university, the deal at HSBC was that the interest-free overdraft would be gradually phased out over a number of years after you left. Out of the blue, I received a letter giving me two weeks' notice it would be withdrawn on July 28. I have a \u00a31,750 overdraft and it has really overshadowed my summer. I've been working for a small charity before returning to do a masters degree, but now I'll have to leave and get a better paying job.\" Mr Streeting, a veteran NUS campaigner, says even he's been taken aback by the scale of the protest. \"I invited my friends on Facebook to respond, and it has turned into a viral campaign. It's a lot better than email and gives people a place where they can protest.\" After a barrage of complaints, the National Union of Students is planning a more conventional day of protest outside HSBC head office in Canary Wharf, London, on September 4. What annoyed Mr Streeting most was what he calls the \"spin\" put on the announcement by HSBC. \"They have tried to say this is helping graduates to pay off their debts. This is the worst sort of commercial spin I've ever seen.\" Others are furious at how little warning they were given. Birmingham University graduate Christina Frampton, who now works for Citizen's Advice, says HSBC failed to give her the 30 days' notice of a major change in conditions that the banking code requires. \"HSBC sent out a massive mailshot to this year's graduates but it was only dated-lined 'July' - no number. Mine arrived on July 31 while the new charges started on August 8. \"This is all wrong - I signed up to HSBC on the understanding of a zero graduate rate and planned along these lines throughout my final year at university. They are targeting a vulnerable group which can find it difficult to switch.\" To make matters worse, HSBC not only cancelled her interest-free overdraft, but put her on the full 18.8% rate charged to standard customers. HSBC says it sent out letters at the start of July, giving the necessary 30 days' notice. \"All those finishing their first degree should have been moved to the new graduate scheme. They can also pay \u00a39.95 a month - free for three months - for a package account which remains interest free,\" it says. HSBC has apologised for its error in the 18.8% Christina was charged. But that's too late for her. She has switched to Barclays which will give her an interest-free graduate account for two years providing she deposits \u00a3500. HSBC says the new arrangement is \"fairer\". It adds: \"Instead of a declining amount being interest free and anything above that being charged at 18.8%, the whole lot will now be 9.9% - and our unauthorised overdraft charges and fees are lower than others. There will be winners and losers.\" But privately the bank concedes it could be difficult to sell its accounts to new university students in September when this month's A level successes see that other banks intend to maintain their interest-free graduate plans. It has to hope rivals will follow its lead - but so far, there is no sign of that. p.collinson@theguardian.com t.levene@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
