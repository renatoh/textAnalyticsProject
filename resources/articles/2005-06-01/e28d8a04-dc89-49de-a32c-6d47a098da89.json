The head of the preferred bank of Popes, princes and merchants across Europe was then Cosimo. During the 15 years since he had inherited the business from his father, he had made money-laundering almost respectable. Florence had recently borrowed no less than 155,000 florins, three times the price of buying off the rampaging mercenary armies that repeatedly threatened her territory. When Cosimo di Medici entered the Palazzo della Signora, he might have expected gratitude. Instead, he was arrested on a charge of treason. His accuser, Rinaldo degli Albizzi, understood that the traditional punishment of exile would fail to quash a political challenger who could draw credit from any one of half-a-dozen of his bank's branches. Yet in calling instead for Cosimo to be beheaded, he neglected to grasp the deeper significance of these new networks of financial power. His local vendetta became an instant international affair: the Pope's emissary, representatives of Venice, even the Marquis of Ferrara, descended on Florence to fight the Medici corner. And when visitors insisted on being admitted to see the prisoner, Cosimo was able to mount a cheque-book coup right under the unseeing eyes of his jailers. In this flawed but fascinating book, Parks's brief account of this episode draws together his themes with a striking lightness of touch. For the magic that the Medici worked with money - its mobility, its invisibility, its mysterious ability to multiply - had transformed their world so utterly that, even as the Albizzi celebrated a triumph, they were caught flat-footed. By the time we reach 1433 - and the second of the five generations of Medici bankers that the book surveys in its century-long narrative of rise and fall - the basic rules of 15th-century high finance have been laid out with elegant clarity. No matter how mighty they became, it seems that there was always a place in a Medici bank for the green, baize-covered trestle table at which Cosimo's father first plied his trade; much that went on below that board is revealed here. But the author of a book whose subtitle - 'Banking, Metaphysics and Art in 15th-century Florence' - promises to conjure a dazzling prism needs his own stratagems to manoeuvre the reader's attention and, in this, Parks is only partly successful, surveying the wide panorama of the 15th century when often the particular would suffice. Although this is a relatively short book, it is hard not to feel that buried within it there is a brilliant essay on the metaphysics of money crying to be let out. Usurers were sinners - perpetually static inhabitants of Dante's hell, their hands alone in an endless whirl of counting - yet the Popes were key clients of the Medici. Florence was a republic and particularly suited to fostering the supranational financial business that the bank became, yet the growing power of the Medici corrupted the constitution to the point where the city became their virtual fiefdom. Parks revels in these paradoxes and the ironies that flow from them, not least for the contemporary resonances. In the 'secret things of our town', the unspoken fixes that make Florentine democracy a cover for oligarchic rule, the echoes of contemporary elections are pointed up: the tampering with constituency boundaries or with the machinery for counting ballots. And when considering life in the great family palazzo during the declining years of the latter part of the century, the image of moral and physical atrophy offered is one for all time: 'Moving goods all over Europe, the Medici men rarely made it to the top floor.' While Parks's conversational style captures the colour and life of the times ('Shit steamed in the pan ... the plague victim did not die in starched sheets'), occasionally his asides seem to semaphore his own unease with the distorting demands that arise from the publishing conceit of the series in which this book stands: that money makes the world go round. Too often, amid a flurry of inconsequential names and tangential historical activity, the reader is drawn back to this drifting anchor. 'Which meant spending a great deal of money, of course,' we are told of a war. Well, yes, but with a more refined argument and fewer pages, such reminders would be unnecessary. Tim Parks has produced a pacy primer on the Medici and one laced with stimulating ideas. It will lie handsomely on the armrest of a club-class seat, its gold cloth binding a clever cover for a text that will needle any complacency about the bubble of credit in which we, too, exist."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
