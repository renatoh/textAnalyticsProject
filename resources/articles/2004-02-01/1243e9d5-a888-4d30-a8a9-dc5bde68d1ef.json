Its new confidence is bolstered by the strongest sterling exchange rate in over a decade and by a wide range of new American and Canadian tourist attractions. Here's what's new this year. Florida Orlando's theme parks have been busy opening - or scheduling launches for - new attractions. Universal Studios' Revenge of the Mummy ride, scheduled to open in Orlando in May - and at Universal Studios Hollywood in June - will carry would-be tomb raiders on an indoor roller coaster deep into the pyramids of ancient Egypt where they will encounter phantom warriors, grisly remains of the pharaohs and a \"ceiling of fire\" (universalstudios.co.uk). Walt Disney World's two new attractions are Mission: Space and Mickey's Philharmagic, one of the biggest 3D cinemas in the world (disneyworld.co.uk). If you want to stay longer than usual in this fantasy land, Disney (0870 2424900) is now offering adult 10-day passes for only \u00a3199, children 3-9 \u00a3159 (compared with \u00a3179 and \u00a3143 for five-day passes). And where better to stay than in Disney's new Pop Century Resort. Departing between May 1 and June 30, Bon Voyage (0800 3160194, bon-voyage.co.uk) has seven-night packages for a family of two adults and two children for a total of \u00a32,192 including British Airways flights.

The three destinations it will serve are Orlando, from June, and Fort Lauderdale and St Petersburg/ Clearwater from July. East coast Never before have there been so many new attractions in Washington DC. The Stephen F Udvar-Hazy Center, a treasure-filled extension of DC's most popular museum, the National Air and Space Museum, opened in December near Washington-Dulles international airport, just across the Potomac river in northern Virginia. This followed hot on the heels of the opening of the City Museum of Washington (+202 383 1800, citymuseumdc.org), which traces 200 years of DC history. The National Museum of the American Indian is scheduled to open in September (+202 287 2525), and on March 1 the scaffolding comes off the city's largest and most majestic memorial - to the second world war - scheduled to be unveiled on Memorial Day (May 29). The lively port city of Baltimore, Maryland, only 40 miles north-east of DC, is also full of new attractions and special events. Throughout 2004, the USS Constellation, the only remaining Civil War-era vessel under sail, will celebrate its 150th anniversary with a series of events in Baltimore's Inner Harbor and along the waterfront of the charming nearby Maryland capital of Annapolis. One of the highlights will be a July 4 Independence Day tall ships spectacular. Also on Baltimore's Inner Harbor the Maryland Science Center (+410 545 5927) will hold a grand opening on May 28-30 of its $32m expansion, housing America's first major exhibition of East Coast dinosaurs.

Located in Columbus Circle's Time Warner Center, the complex includes four restaurants, with one yet to come, and celebrity chefs and one of the city's latest hotel openings - the Mandarin Oriental (mandarinoriental.com). The hotel's 14,500 square foot Spa has a 75ft lap pool, his-and-hers relaxation lounges, a tea lounge and a spa suite with stunning views, fireplace, bath, dual massage beds and a special treatment bed for shiatsu and Thai massage.
