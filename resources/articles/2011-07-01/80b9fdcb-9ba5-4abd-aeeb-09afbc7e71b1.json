The standard, in my opinion, is wrong.\" So says Joss Stone, explaining the ethos driving her new record company, Stone'd, for which this is the first release. Standard, however, is the word that springs to mind when listening to LP1. Recorded under the aegis of Dave Stewart in Nashville over the course of a solitary week, this album is desperate to evoke adored music of the past; any number of low-slung country riffs, honky-tonk organ flourishes and, of course, soulful vocal howls being deployed in the cause. It's proficiently played and Stone's voice has a range and tonal dexterity that few of her peers possess. Sadly, however, the final product is so familiar and so shorn of genuine emotion that LP1 quickly loses any sense of identity and becomes standard fare, indistinguishable from any number of other recordings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
