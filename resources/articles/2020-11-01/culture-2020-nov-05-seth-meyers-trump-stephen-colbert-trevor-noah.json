Trump\u2019s rant was \u201cdeeply dangerous authoritarian behavior and a major test for the national media\u201d, said Meyers. \u201cWe have to resist this. Trump\u2019s logic here is obvious, it\u2019s grotesque: he wants to keep counting Trump votes, but stop counting Biden votes. If he had his way, he\u2019d get to personally sift through every ballot and cross out Biden\u2019s name.\u201d Meyers also reserved plenty of ire for Fox News, the president\u2019s favored network, which has been \u201cpriming their audience\u201d with lies about voter fraud for weeks. \u201cAnd now the moment is here and they\u2019re taking the outrageous and unprecedented step of falsely declaring victory before all the votes are counted,\u201d Meyers said. With its backing of a president who openly called for an end to counting votes while he was ahead, the Republican party has become \u201can authoritarian movement intent on detonating our democracy and turning it into an autocracy with a healthy sprinkling of psychosis\u201d, said Meyers, pointing to the reaction by Fox talking heads to Trump\u2019s \u201cincoherent and insane\u201d late-night address in which he prematurely and baselessly declared victory. \u201cEx-Bush hack\u201d Dana Perino, for example, extended Trump\u2019s false voter fraud claims by suggesting that Pennsylvania would \u201call of a sudden\u201d find 100,000 votes \u201cin a trashcan\u201d. \u201cYou ghouls love your evidence-free musings, don\u2019t you?\u201d Meyers retorted. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t belong in the news. That belongs in a Pennysaver column called \u2018Dana\u2019s Digressions\u2019. There\u2019s literally no proof for what you\u2019re saying. \u201cCounting votes is not finding votes,\u201d Meyers later added. \u201cThey\u2019re not scanning the beach with a metal detector. This isn\u2019t a scavenger hunt.\u201d Stephen Colbert \u201cTwenty-four hours later, we still don\u2019t know the winner of the presidential election,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday night, still on his election special set. Biden seemed headed toward victory after picking up swing states Wisconsin and Michigan, but \u201cafter all that good news for Biden, in a move that reeks of desperation and cheap cologne, with a million votes still uncounted, Trump\u2019s campaign manager came out of the blue\u201d to announce premature and false victory in Pennsylvania. \u201cI fully expect his victory in Pennsylvania to be just as successful as his victory over coronavirus,\u201d Colbert deadpanned. Colbert urged viewers to be patient with the ongoing trickle of results. \u201cIf Covid has taught us nothing, it\u2019s that patience is valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember when the pandemic started, a trip to the grocery store would last eight hours because you had to wipe down every single grape before you put it in the refrigerator. This is the same thing: we\u2019re wiping down every single ballot before we put them in America\u2019s fridge.\u201d Trump, as predicted, did not wait: on Tuesday night, he attempted to undermine the democratic process with an unfounded claim of voter fraud and by baselessly claiming: \u201cFrankly, we did win this election.\u201d \u201cThere it is: a power grab by a terrified strongman in the dead of night,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cClassic. If there\u2019s anything 2am is known for, it\u2019s desperate moves by sad little men who are afraid to go home feeling like a loser.\u201d Trevor Noah And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah tore into Trump\u2019s late-night attempt to undermine the election by prematurely declaring victory and falsely dismissing changes in ballot counts as fraudulent. \u201cYeah dude, because first they counted your votes, and now they\u2019re counting the other guy\u2019s votes,\u201d Noah said of the shifts in the race. \u201cI mean I know Trump shit on science, but I didn\u2019t realize he had disavowed numbers. I mean maybe this explains why he\u2019s always in debt? \u201cThis is just a level of stupidity from Trump that I did not expect,\u201d he added. \u201cSometimes it feels like Trump is an actual toddler: \u2018first I had a nose, then suddenly my uncle stole it, and I had no nose.\u2019\u201d As for Trump\u2019s claim on Tuesday night, with millions of uncounted votes, that \u201cas far as I\u2019m concerned, we already have won it,\u201d Noah reacted with shock sans surprise. \u201cWow. I know everyone was expecting it but, still, can we just take a moment to admit that it is insane that an American president is just demanding that they stop counting votes while he\u2019s ahead? This is a textbook authoritarian move, which is impressive coming from a guy who\u2019s never read a textbook. \u201cFor a guy who hates \u2018shithole countries\u2019, Trump really likes to jack their style,\u201d he added. \u201cI mean, I never thought I\u2019d see the day when someone yelling at me to go back to Africa sounded more like a concern for my rights instead of a threat.\u201d Noah concluded with a warning: \u201cBe careful, America. If you let Trump do this, then voting could soon become one of those things that people do to feel better, but doesn\u2019t actually do anything, you know? Like taking CBD oil or recycling plastic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
