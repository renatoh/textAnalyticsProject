The CD-rom Grid Magic Q4 Technologies www.q4.com Price 10-user licence, \u00a3352.50 inc VAT; site licence, \u00a3440.63 inc VAT Age 7-14 yrs Grid Magic is a graphic design package that enables children to create amazing computer artwork by using and extending their mathematical knowledge and skills. It features tools to allow children to create individual artwork through the use of ICT, thinking skills and mathematics. The program is designed to provide a tool for children to create an original piece of computer artwork, as an alternative to the all-too-familiar clip-art options. Children can design their own writing paper, labels, stickers and wrapping paper. The most prominent feature is that it requires children to use and practise mathematical and ICT skills to create their final piece of work. There are five main areas that perform different functions: Grid Design, Art Work, Mosaic, Presentation and Portfolio. Once a piece of work has been created in one part of the program, it can be sent to another to add other effects or to change its appearance. Finished creations can be sent to the presentation area to add a picture frame, a background colour and a caption. Grid Magic, which is aimed at key stage 2 pupils, produces graphic art in a mathematical environment. Lots of mathematical language is used, including scale, ratio, coordinates, tessellate, angles and direction. This product is most strongly linked to the ICT and design technology curriculum. It asks a great deal of children initially in terms of navigating the work areas and following detailed instructions. However, the tools and menu bars will pose no difficulties for those familiar with Microsoft Windows. This is a very well designed and presented product, and the quality of images is excellent. The screen images change quickly in response to the user's commands and undo just as quickly when mistakes are made. Designs are easily transported between work areas using the same tool. Links with the internet are smooth and reliable. This package is well worth exploring. The book The Midnight Ship and The Flying Vampire, by Rose Impey, illustrated by Moira Kemp Mathew Price Price \u00a33.99 each Age 5-8 yrs The Beast, by Ann Evans Usborne Books Price \u00a34.99 Age 9-12 yrs The vogue for horror has largely given way to fantasy. But enthusiasm for the genre within popular culture remains strong. Rose Impey's Creepies series takes young readers on a journey of alarm and suspense, rooted firmly within a domestic context but allowed to travel some distance from the familiarity of the opening lines. Her mini-dramas, narrated in the first person, are outstanding read-alouds (though nobody does it quite as well as the author). And for older readers, they offer insight into the construction of a story - tension, fear, cliffhangers, teasing. The colour illustrations will offer comfort to less robust youngsters, as they largely explain the source of the tension. Usborne has recently established a most promising fiction list, its range - like its acclaimed non-fiction - acknowledging what is popular while remaining committed to quality. The Thriller series boasts such writers as Paul Stewart, Malcolm Rose and Terry Deary and will appeal to boys and girls. Good horror isn't about cheap thrills, as The Beast demonstrates with style and substance. Evans's writing is evocative and full of atmosphere, her plotting compelling and convincing.
