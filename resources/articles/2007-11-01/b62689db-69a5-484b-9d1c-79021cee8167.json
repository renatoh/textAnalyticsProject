In 2006, the Children's Legal Centre acted for Shabina Begum in a case involving the exclusion from school of a Muslim girl for refusing to remove a jilbab. In reaching its decision, the Lords commented that the government should provide clearer guidance to schools to ensure all uniform policies conform to the Human Rights Act. The new Department for Children, Schools and Families' guidance includes some consideration of a pupil's right to religious expression, but this guidance is, unfortunately, not sufficiently comprehensive or detailed to ensure that pupils are not excluded in circumstances which may violate their human rights to freedom of religion, education and non-discrimination. Without such guidance, pupils will continue to be excluded from school and suffer disruptions in their education in circumstances which violate their rights. This also makes schools more susceptible to legal challenges from such pupils that have a negative effect on staff time and financial resources. School uniform policies should allow pupils to express their religion, where this expression is legitimate and proportionate, without fear of being excluded from school and having their education interrupted. The government needs to assist schools in ensuring the uncertainties are resolved.
