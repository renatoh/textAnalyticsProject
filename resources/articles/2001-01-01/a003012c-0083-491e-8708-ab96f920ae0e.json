Gone are the days when boys would whittle away bookends in the woodwork room while the girls learned to whip up a Victoria sponge in home economics; with the help of advanced technologies, today's schoolchildren are learning life skills that will stand them in good stead in the workplace as well as the home. \"ICT has opened a whole new board game in schools generally,\" says Richard Hammond, education officer at Becta, \"but within design and technology there are just so many different applications for computers.\" Product design and manufacture is perhaps proving the most fertile area, particularly since the arrival of Cad/Cam technology (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture) in the classroom. Through the auspices of the Design and Technology Association (Data) and its DfEE-funded Cad in Schools project, more than 2,000 schools have the sophisticated Prodesktop drawing package, allowing children to design products in three dimensions. \"This product, in particular, has revolutionised secondary-level design and technology,\" says Hammond. \"Prodesktop is a professional tool and the work children produce using it is of outstanding quality, especially when coupled with access to a computerised milling machine. Where in the past they would be churning out little clocks or CD racks or lamps which looked very much like they had been made in school, now they are producing things you could actually sell in a shop.\" The beauty of Cad is its versatility. Within textiles, for instance, the software allows pupils to compose a design on the computer, then have it immediately embroidered by a sewing machine. And Cad provides access for all abilities. \"Even children who can't draw can go on a computer and knock out a professional design and produce excellent results,\" says Hammond. Beyond design, ICT can enliven more mundane, logistical activities. A typical key stage three activity, such as developing a system to control a car park, comes alive with software that incorporates the elements of barrier control and car counting into a virtual reality model, allowing pupils to see the results of their decisions. \"Indeed, with some of the more sophisticated packages, you can actually build a model of a car park and the software will then control it,\" says Hammond. Another growing area for ICT is in food technology. A nutritional database, for instance, enables children to get more accurate analysis and results more quickly, explains Jenny Jupe, deputy chief executive at Data. \"Before we had computers, kids had to use nutritional tables, a bit like logarithms, which were subject to inaccuracies and very time-consuming to use. With a nutritional database they can perform 'what-if' activities, such as substituting different ingredients to reduce the sugar content and see what effect that has on calories or nutrients in a product. And when they're developing products it helps them produce labelling information for the packet, such as the nutritional value per portion and serving.\" As well as using a digital camera to keep a record of the food they produce, children can also use spreadsheets to log data on factors such as temperature during cooking or freezing, or to model food costings or sensory analysis. \"They can analyse different areas, such as a product's taste, texture, mouth feel and so on,\" says Jupe, \"then judge their product against those criteria and record their results using a spreadsheet. It helps them to develop different products and then to test them to see how they match up to their original spec.\" At the cutting edge of food technology, virtual reality gives children experience of industrial production and processes. The advent of stricter health and safety regulations has made it very difficult to take children around companies and factories, according to Hammond. \"But they still need to know about all the systems involved in food production. \"As a result several companies have now produced packages that give you a virtual tour of a production line and control of the whole system and that actually carry out various safety checks.\" Indeed, one of the main thrusts of ICT in design and technology is to reflect the realities of the workplace, he says. \"We're trying to get rid of this outdated image of oily rags in engineering and a pinny in food technology. Even in textiles everything is now controlled by ICT. We're trying to reflect this in teaching, by showing children what happens in the real world.\" Despite the inroads that ICT has made into the workshop and classroom at the school, Hammond insists that children have plenty of opportunity to get their hands dirty. \"ICT is a very important part of the national curriculum, but there is still a lot of work that is not ICT-based. Children still have to use traditional skills to try things out, such as making a cake as a sample before going into batch production, and so they're still getting access to a lot of hands-on experience.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
