The number of lorries using the tunnel fell 2% to just under 300,000, while the number of cars rose 1% to just shy of 610,000. Coach traffic leapt almost 35% to 19,500. Eurotunnel, which is still trying to thrash out a deal to reduce its \u00a36bn debts, saw revenues from shuttle services gain 1% to \u00a377.9m but revenues from train operators using the tunnel were unchanged at \u00a358.7m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
