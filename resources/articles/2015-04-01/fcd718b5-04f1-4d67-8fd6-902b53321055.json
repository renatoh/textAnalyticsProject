This indie-folk band, fronted by guitarist Nick Hemming and piano-playing co-vocalist Christian Hardy, have inadvertently made a concept album inspired by the death of one of Hemming\u2019s friends from cancer. While an upbeat piano hook anchors Nothing Like This and I\u2019m a Setting Sun relies on chunky guitar riffs and peppy horns, the lyrics deal primarily with loneliness and mortality: on Outside In, Hemming sings, \u201cIn your heart you know you\u2019re worth/More than you were ever told,\u201d over a paradoxically chirpy melody. The Fine Art of Hanging On is another capably written set, but turns its back on the band\u2019s pared-down folk roots in favour of baroque-pop arrangements that reach for the heights of Rufus Wainwright and Illinoise-era Sufjan Stevens, but don\u2019t always hit the mark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
