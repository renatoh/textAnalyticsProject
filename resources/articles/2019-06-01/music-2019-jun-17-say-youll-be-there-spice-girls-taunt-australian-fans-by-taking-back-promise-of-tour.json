Spice Girls taunt Australian fans by taking back promise of tour", "bodyText": "The Spice Girls have continued to taunt their Australian fans by saying a down under tour was imminent and then retracting the promise within hours. On stage at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium for the final show of their UK tour on Saturday night, Melanie \u201cScary Spice\u201d Brown seemed to confirm a tour would spice up the lives of Australian audiences in 2020, saying: \u201cSee you in February in Australia!\u201d The announcement sent Australian fans into a spin on social media, as the 1990s pop group have never toured the country \u2013 famously cancelling a scheduled show in Sydney in 2008 citing members\u2019 family commitments. 2020 looked more like a wannabe tour in the cold light of Monday morning, however, as Brown said in a radio interview that an Australia tour wasn\u2019t quite so certain, and that she was just \u201cmanifesting\u201d the idea. \u201cI\u2019m always going to say the Spice Girls are going to continue and continue to tour the entire world,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bee in my bonnet about it. We need to come to Australia, first out the gate. We\u2019ve done London and now we need to come to Australia. So I announced it on stage, yes, without everybody else signing off on it. But I figured if I put it out there I figured maybe it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Earlier on Sunday evening Geri \u201cGinger Spice\u201d Horner apologised for leaving the Spice Girls in 1998 \u2013 a move that shocked fans at the time and was seen by many as the beginning of the end for the group, which went on hiatus for almost eight years in 2000. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for leaving. I was just being a brat.\u201d Since that first hiatus the Spice Girls have re-formed repeatedly for appearances and tours, with varying lineups. The just-completed reunion tour featured only four of the group \u2013 Horner, Brown, Melanie Chisholm and Emma Bunton \u2013 with Victoria Beckham sitting out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
