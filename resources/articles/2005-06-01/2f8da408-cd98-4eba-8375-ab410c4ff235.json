The trainer saddled two of the six winners at Royal Ascot at York yesterday, and three more at Newbury, rewarding one Hill's punter with \u00a3156,815.60 for a bet that cost \u00a318.90. The backer placed his bet in a Brighton bookies, just 20 miles from Dunlop's Arundel yard, and may have needed a stiff drink as one winner after another flew home. Dunlop's double at the Royal meeting was initiated by Thakafaat, who took the Ribblesdale Stakes at 22-1. The winner led almost from the start, but had to fight for every inch of turf to hold the late challenge of Twyla Tharp by a short-head. \"I thought we'd been beaten on the line,\" Dunlop said. \"It was a question of who had got there on the nod, and she deserved to win, she's very brave and tough. The obvious target now would be the Park Hill at Doncaster in September and easier ground would be a big help to her.\" Dunlop later saddled Jedburgh to take the Buckingham Palace Stakes, the final race on the card, and send Mick Kinane into a big lead in the race to be the top jockey at the meeting. \"When I woke up this morning, I thought that if I have one winner, I'll by happy,\" Dunlop said. \"Jedburgh ran a cracker when Mick won on him at Newmarket first time out this season, but he didn't seem to try too hard in the Victoria Cup at Lingfield and it was the same story at Newmarket last time. So we decided to put a set of blinkers on him and they appear to have worked the oracle. You could say that this has been rather a good day.\" Kinane, who has now ridden four winners at the meeting, is 2-7 with totesport to maintain his lead until Saturday evening. Kieren Fallon is 11-4 to overhaul him, and it is 20-1 bar the two."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
