Under the newly adopted resolution, BSA rules would allow people to be troop leaders regardless of their sexuality. The organization\u2019s National Executive Board is set to ratify the resolution on 27 July and comments made by the BSA president, Robert Gates, in May indicate that it is likely to push the policy change through. Gates told a crowd at the BSA meeting in Atlanta that if the organization upholds its ban on gay leaders, it \u201cwill be the end of us as a national movement\u201d. He said the changing national climate toward LGBT rights and mounting legal challenges against BSA because of the ban left the organization with few other options. This issue was reinforced in Monday\u2019s announcement, which also clarified that religious-chartered groups can \u201ccontinue to choose adult leaders whose beliefs are consistent with their own\u201d. In May 2014, BSA announced that it would accept openly gay young males into the programme, but reinforced its ban on LGBT adults. Despite this, groups in New York and Colorado allowed gay and lesbian scout leaders. If the resolution is adopted as described in BSA documents, leaders who were previously removed because of their sexuality could reapply for their positions. The Scouts for Equality executive director, Zach Wahls, who has been a leader in the movement to change the policy, celebrated the vote on Monday. \u201cFor decades, the Boy Scouts of America\u2019s ban on gay adults has stood as a towering example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America\u2019s most important and recognizable civic organizations,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cWhile this policy change is not perfect \u2013 BSA\u2019s religious chartering partners will be allowed to continue to discriminate against gay adults \u2013 it is difficult to overstate the importance of today\u2019s announcement.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
