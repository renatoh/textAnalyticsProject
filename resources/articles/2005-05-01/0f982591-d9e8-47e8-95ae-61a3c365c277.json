Admittedly the concord regards views expressed pre-patronage, when back in 1997 Andrew wrote that \"there is no public enthusiasm for lords, ladies and the other feudal relics\". You're so right, my Lord, and you could have gone further, by explaining that there's not much more excitement for those institutions among your fellow peers, at least judging by the latest Lords attendance figures. The last session's register (it's called each morning, just before assembly) reveals that 40% of peers turned up for less than half the time. More than 60% of them couldn't be bothered to make it to the chamber for three-quarters of the sitting days, of which there are just 157 (and there's barely a necessity to remain conscious during most of them). Those needing frequent sick notes were Mr Tony's blue-skies thinker Lord Birt (who clocked in on just 50% of days), Labour peer Lord Alli (52%), Tory benefactors Lords Steinberg (33%) and Ashcroft (17%) and the new Lib Dem Lord Vallance (30%), whose previous job as chairman of British Telecom at least required the odd two-day week. We rang each one for an explanation, but the blanket silence suggested all were sleeping soundly. Perhaps the test was unfair. We called after lunch. \u00b7 Up in Manchester there are other patronage concerns. You may have heard that the local football team is being sold to a worrying-looking American, a deal that has little going for it except infuriating Man U fans and axing the club's army of high-earning directors. The tradition at Old Trafford is for departing chairmen to get a lifetime season ticket (Martin Edwards and Sir Roland Smith both got theirs), and two years ago, when the takeover stories surfaced, chairman Sir Roy Gardner began his campaign. There's no word as yet on whether Sir Roy will be taking his prawn sandwiches next to Joel Glazer or James Nesbitt, but we send him our best wishes. If he's really lucky, he could secure a lifetime seat for even longer. Sir Matt Busby (d. 1994) still has his. \u00b7 Just a week into his new job and David Blunkett has fallen out with the press. This time it's the Daily Mail, for a supposed breach of the Administration of Justice Act when publishing some tale about the new pensions secretary and \"that little lad\". That would be the same Daily Mail that is edited by Paul Dacre, who Blunkett described in 2003 as \"a man who reflects the best of journalism\". Come on boys. Kiss and make up. \u00b7 Proof, if it were needed, that Michael Howard is thinking something quite different from the rest of us. Begging the Tory party's factions to remain friends, during his (valedictory?) showing on Breakfast with Frost over the weekend, Michael argued: \"We have discovered over the last 18 months some old Tory characteristics of discipline and unity and a respectful way of behaving towards each other.\" Tell that to Howard Flight. And Danny Kruger. \u00b7 Another day, another balls up in Yorkshire's NHS. This time it's the dire Mid Yorkshire Hospitals Trust, which accidentally sent out a batch of confidential documents disclosing (among other things) inquiries into alleged bullying, professional misconduct and a \"serious untoward incident\". Oh, and the dispatch included the trust's \"document control guidance\", for improved handling of confidential information. \u00b7 We'll leave you with the Ulster Unionist party's David Burnside, who has lost his seat but retained a sense of irony. Here he is trashing any leadership ambitions of the party's last remaining MP, Lady Hermon. \"She does not have the presence in the House of Commons,\" said the former member for South Antrim. Almost, David. \u00b7 diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
