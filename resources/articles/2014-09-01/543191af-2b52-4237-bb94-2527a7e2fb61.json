Or else it has some bizarre structure attached, the relic of a short-lived and forgotten fad promoted by an ex-professor. Sometimes they are statements of serious architecture, by architects conscious of the opportunity to show future generations of young minds how to do it, for which they are rewarded by Oedipal revolt by the first of those generations. Such was the Art and Architecture building at Yale by the giant of 1960s architecture Paul Rudolph, whose career was dealt a severe blow by students\u2019 violent reaction to his brutalist forms. Which may have included arson: the cause of a suspicious fire in 1969 was never established. Until now architecture students at the University of Greenwich have been housed in a complex in the really ugly category, in a remote location in south-east London. According to Baroness Blackstone, the former Labour minister who was the university\u2019s vice-chancellor from 2004 to 2011: \u201cI was not going to leave this place until I had done something\u201d about these \u201chorrible\u201d premises. \u201cI was not going to have architecture students out in the suburbs.\u201d So the university acquired a site in the centre of Greenwich, where the financial crisis had stalled a commercial scheme, which meant, she says, they could get a good deal. A competition was held, with Richard Rogers and David Adjaye on the jury, and David Chipperfield and Zaha Hadid among the entrants. The winners were Heneghan Peng, the Dublin-based practice of R\u00f3is\u00edn Heneghan and Shih-Fu Peng. Their projects include the Grand Egyptian Museum, close to the Great Pyramid, for which they beat what was at the time the largest field of entrants of any architectural competition ever. They also designed the most substantial of the many bridges in the Olympic Park, which during the games was covered in a surface of brightly coloured spots, and the visitor\u2019s centre for the Giant\u2019s Causeway in Northern Ireland, which was shortlisted for the 2013 Stirling prize. \u201cWe\u2019re the experience-less architects,\u201d says Peng, because their habit of doing one each of several different building types means \u201cmost of what we\u2019re doing is for the first time\u201d. The new School of Architecture and Construction is also materiel in the constructional arms race in which universities are now engaged. In the competition to attract students, bigger and better facilities are built, to which we owe two structures on this year\u2019s Stirling shortlist, the Saw Swee Hock student centre at the LSE, and the Manchester School of Art. This is an improvement on building libraries and faculties to resemble units in business parks, which until recently was the dominant trend. So Heneghan Peng\u2019s \u00a376m building is an academic aircraft carrier moored, appropriately enough, close to the naval sanctuaries of Greenwich \u2013 Wren and Hawksmoor\u2019s grand composition for the Old Royal Naval College, the National Maritime Museum, the Cutty Sark. But these same sanctuaries also constitute a Unesco world heritage site, which means the new building has to rise to the dignity of the setting. It therefore has two main elements: a robust, industrial concrete frame containing expansive, well-lit studios, a library and seminar rooms, and a stone front, which continues the curve of a pleasant historic street while adjusting its scale both to reflect the importance of the university and to address the grand neighbouring church, partly by Hawksmoor, of St Alfege. The concrete frame is what the head of the school, Neil Spiller, calls a \u201cbig rig\u201d and a \u201c24-hour living toy\u201d, something that invites students to express themselves by adding installations and large models. At its centre is a large, high-ceilinged hall, overlooked by stairs and galleries, for the daunting event at the heart of architectural education called crits, in which students publicly offer their work to often devastating critiques by their teachers and visiting eminences. Heneghan Peng\u2019s design heightens the drama and raises the stakes, and makes the crit still less suitable for nervous dispositions. In a new book, Educating Architects, Spiller describes himself and his collaborators as \u201cpractising social surrealists with advanced senses of humour\u201d who invite students \u201conly to think about the future, technology, and building their own world\u2026 about what it means to be human, have fun, play, love and desire\u201d. Heneghan Peng\u2019s design was pretty much complete when Spiller joined the university, so he hasn\u2019t influenced it, but he sees it as serving his ambitious, going on portentous, ideas. The stone front, between domestic and monumental, helps serve another of the project\u2019s ambitions, which is to connect the university and the public. It contains a zone of gallery, cafe, and other spaces, placed behind glass shop fronts, which anyone can enter. To this stone front and the concrete frame is added a third, appealing, element, a series of 14 roof gardens at the rear which will include vineyards, beehives, ponds and facilities for growing algae. A significant part of the school is its programme of landscape architecture, and these spaces are intended to be open-air laboratories for testing ideas, while also being outdoor extensions of the grand playground of the interior. Further incidents include the various floors of the library, with different levels of seclusion and openness, and a flank wall next to a railway cutting, with angled fins to direct views away from the tracks. It is a building of many aspects and characters, given unity by an all-over stony colour, and by a plan of alternating fat and thin bands, which is most clearly stated on the street facade. It sometimes argues with itself \u2013 the uses of the building, and the ways you move through it, cut across the fat and thin bands in a way that doesn\u2019t feel meant or considered. The transitions are sometimes awkward, as when the industrial world of harsh metal balustrades meets the delicate green stuff. It has rough-and-ready details, exposing ducts, wires and bolts often covered up, in order to make a virtue out of reducing costs. Heneghan Peng have a way of throwing a lot of ideas into the air, and not being too picky about what happens when they land. But this is a generous, confident building that is driven by ideas about what education might be, allows interpretation by Spiller and his heirs, and also challenges students to inhabit and discover it. They won\u2019t set fire to it, probably."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
