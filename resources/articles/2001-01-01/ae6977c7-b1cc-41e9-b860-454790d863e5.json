Football might win, because merit is not the only consideration when Nobel Prizes are doled out (of which more later). Yet when you first hear Gustafsson's proposal, it sounds ludicrous. 'I hear I am a laughing stock in LA,' he told me, 'where a newspaper said I should watch some more football. But this is a very serious proposal.' Football, he wrote to the Nobel committee, 'has an important role in the global arena when it comes to creating understanding between people'. Gustafsson notes that hostile countries have played football against each other when other contact was unthinkable: Iran-US in the 1998 World Cup, North Korea-South Korea in a 1991 youth championship. One's immediate reaction is to ask: what about hooligans, the Hand of God and the Mirror's views on Germans, not to mention the 1969 war following two matches between El Salvador and Honduras? Football is tribal conflict. That is even true of the Gustafsson household. 'I am a Liverpooler, and my son is a United fan,' says the MP. 'So we have some fights at home, but mostly verbally.' Luckily Gustafsson can look after himself physically, having played for six years in the Swedish first division. But one's second response is kinder. Football is a fine candidate for the prize, even if it doesn't do much to resolve conflicts. If Iran and the US get on better now, it's not because they have played a few matches recently. The two governments decided to make friends, then used the games to drag their citizens with them. In any case, I was at the Iran-US match and none of the Iranian crowd in Lyon showed the slightest interest in America. Instead, most wore T-shirts printed with the face of the female leader of an Iranian opposition group, and were there to protest against Iran's government. When the ball went into the stands, people would stand up pointing at their chests, presuming their message was being sent to the world. It wasn't. Fifa had ordered all political slogans be censored, so the cameras blacked out the fans. Football doesn't end conflicts. But it does do decades of spadework. This is an atomised world where everyone has a different religion and even family structure. Many people have never met a foreigner. Besides eating, drinking and procreating, the only thing billions have in common is football. The average World Cup causes more deaths than goals, but it gets people everywhere doing the same thing. A match might create bad feelings - England-Argentina, or Holland-Germany - but it is also an occasion when both countries co-operate. They play by agreed rules, and even though they may quarrel, the loser accepts that the winner proceeds. Then the whole world talks about the same thing. Football fans may be a global minority, but they still outnumber English-speakers, Christians or any other human sub-division. I watched most of the 1994 World Cup in a Boston bar packed with nationalities. For Bulgaria-Greece, say, there would be a handful of Bulgarians and a dozen Greeks. People would tease each other, but clap good goals, and talk about Oleg Salenko or how everyone hoped the US would get knocked out soon. This is part of the glue that sticks the world together. There isn't much else. So football deserves the prize, particularly if travelling fans of the England team are banned from the award ceremony. However, merit hardly matters. Have you ever wondered why the Nobel Prize for literature is always won by unknown poets, many of them foreigners, rather than by truly great writers like Helen Fielding? The answer is lobbying. The average literary cocktail party in Gothenburg is packed with authors scouring the room for elderly Swedes who might be in a position to give them the Nobel Prize. It so happens that I am lobbying for a Nobel Prize myself. My sister, who works in public health, knows a Swede who sits on the committee that awards the medicine prize. I have asked her to put my name forward. Come December, I would not be surprised to find myself in the Stockholm Concert Hall receiving the award, and I hope to share the celebrations with - on behalf of football - Pele."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
