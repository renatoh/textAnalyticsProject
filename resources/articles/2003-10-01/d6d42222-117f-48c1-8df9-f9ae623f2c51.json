And \"music theatre\", a term that encompasses everything from Bob Fosse to Harrison Birtwistle, via the Tubes, Frank Denyer and Bill Bailey (who could probably work wonders with Sir Harry's Gawain). In the contemporary music field, it can result in works such as Karlheinz Stockhausen's Harlekin - which requires a solo clarinet player to prance around in harlequin costume. Or George Crumb's Ancient Voices of Children - more restrained but no less theatrical. Like Charles Ives' The Unanswered Question, it makes use of the auditorium's space, with players in different places, or offstage, creating spatial effects familiar to anyone who makes acoustic music, but which are impossible to recreate on a regular stereo recording. In less cerebral music, the performance element can be anything from the Shadows-like footwork of the Bembeya Jazz guitarists to the flamboyant way the horn section of the Spanish Harlem Orchestra sway from side to side. In dance/movement terms it's a little corny and symmetrical, but it's a solution that enables the players to create some performance excitement while sight-reading. If you memorise the music, you can do more. String septet Gogmagogs, for instance, have commissioned, memorised and realised a significant body of uniquely physical music theatre, which requires them to dance, sing, act, writhe and tumble around the stage while playing their instruments to a high standard. Which brings us Cyberjam (currently at the Queen's Theatre, London), which is like a big (35-strong) glitzy, jumping, dancing version of Gogmagogs for the West End crowd. But where the Gogs devised performance methods and commissioned music from scratch, Cyberjam deviser James Mason has drawn on a US tradition - the drum and bugle corps and high school big bands that give young musicians a sociable alternative to practising in their bedrooms. For years, Mason led Star of Indiana, a world champion drum and bugle corps. Like the spelling bees portrayed in the documentary film Spellbound, this has a competitive element that's alien to European schoolchildren. When he itched to move on, he devised the show Blast, followed now by Cyberjam. \"The musicians are asked to role-play, they're asked to act, they're asked to get physically involved with the music. And it's a good way to use these venues and excite a whole new generation.\" This means that you get rip-roaring big-band numbers (Swing, Swing, Swing), smooth jazz, sweaty percussion workouts, asymmetric tributes to the Don Ellis band (Star People, Turkish Bath), new commissions of varying quality and pop tunes (Queen, Beach Boys). I've listened to more military band arrangements of golden oldies - in parks, at school concerts - than I care to think. Though you can sympathise with the determination of concert-masters or teachers to give the audience something they recognise, the result is often a gooey mess. Cyberjam's versions of Bohemian Rhapsody and Good Vibrations critique this genre. They make fun of it but deliver the arrangements with great musicianship and fun, and the Brian Wilson classic inspires a little bit of antiphonal improvisation, with brass players spilling out into the auditorium, responding to the gestures of an on-stage trombonist. Cyberjam has puzzled people, even its supporters. It's a West End show that's not a musical. There's no story; no soppy lyrics; it's not exploitative or nasty; it's closer to circus, but with simpler tricks and better music. You can take your kids, your neighbours, your parents and grandparents. For Mason, it's a \"new musical genre\", like a live version of Disney's Fantasia. He hopes it might give instrumental music something to help it compete in a visually saturated culture. But what's the point? Well, you sit in the dark for two hours and enjoy it. At the end, you can chat to the performers in the foyer. They've got great charm, grace and musical ability, not to mention stamina - playing eight shows a week. More uncool than the Darkness. Which makes them pretty cool, these days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
