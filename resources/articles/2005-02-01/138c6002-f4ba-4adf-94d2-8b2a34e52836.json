It's not very impressive looking at the moment, as there aren't enough entries with enough tags, and so most of the tags have only been used once. The more you use a tag, the bigger it gets. So this entry is tagged with existing tags to bootstrap the process a little. Also, the links currently point to Google, rather than the internal search engine. I'm just rebuilding that, so the links will change soon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
