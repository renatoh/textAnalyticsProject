Angel Jimenez was arrested last week after several of his alleged victims identified him as their attacker, police said. He claims he was illegally detained and is innocent. A judge ruled on Sunday there was enough evidence to hold him for trial. Police believe Mr Jimenez has raped women from the United States, Belgium and Britain over recent years. Mr Jimenez had been a legal resident of the United States, but he was deported in 1988 after being convicted of robbery, the US embassy said. The rapist spoke fluent English, as does Mr Jimenez. Officials have said the rapist used English to lure his victims into hotel rooms or secluded places, where he would rape them, sometimes repeatedly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
