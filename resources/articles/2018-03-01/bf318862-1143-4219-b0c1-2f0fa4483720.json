The rare genetic mutation is associated with the breathing muscles. \u201cPreviously the whole focus of trying to understand it was either the heart or the brain cells controlling breathing,\u201d said Professor Michael Hanna of the MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases at University College London, one of the authors of a new paper in the Lancet medical journal. There were, Hanna said, hundreds of other genes associated with the breathing muscles that scientists would now want to investigate to discover whether they were involved and if so, how big a role they played. Sudden infant death syndrome (Sids), or cot death, is rare. The babies involved are typically between two and four months old and appear healthy. There are about 300 such unexpected deaths in the UK every year and 2,400 in the US. The advice to all new parents is to lay their child on their back and not their front, not to smoke near them and not to share a bed with them. These measures reduce the risk, but scientists have been unable to find causes in most of the cases. One previous mutation in a heart gene which may play a part in Sids has been found. The new study looked in a different direction, at the prevalence of mutations in the SCN4A gene that codes for an important cell surface receptor. The expression of this cell receptor in breathing muscles is low at birth and increases over the first two years of life. They studied the cases of 278 children who died unexpectedly and were classified as Sids \u2013 84 from the UK and 194 from the US. They compared their genes with those of 729 matched adults who had no history of cardiovascular, respiratory or neurological disease. The rare mutation was found in four of the children who died and none of the adults. Although a small number, it is highly significant because it is normally found in fewer than five people in every 100,000. The authors think the mutation could leave the children with weaker breathing muscles, and more vulnerable if sleeping in the wrong position or tangled in the bedclothes. \u201cIn the population we studied, the evidence is strong that it is at the very least a risk factor in those cases that had it [the genetic mutation],\u201d said Hanna. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t explain the majority of Sids,\u201d he said. But it could allow parents who were thinking of having another baby after a cot death to undergo IVF, with a view to selecting embryos that were free of the mutation. There was also a drug which could potentially be given to babies born with the mutation to try to protect them at least for the first few months of life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
