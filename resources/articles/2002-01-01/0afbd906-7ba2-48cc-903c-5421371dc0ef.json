Resorts are now offering a range of off-the-wall activities for skiers and snowboarders with a sense of adventure who fancy a day's break from the slopes. Here's a selection of what's on offer: Kiteboarding What is it? The latest winter sports craze to hit the slopes. Boarders and skiers cling on to a specially adapted sail and are driven along by the wind. Kiteboarders can leap up to 40 metres. Where can I do it? Ischgl, Austria. How much does it cost? Two hours' tuition costs \u00a3113 (\u20ac180) For more information: Call Jens Liebhauser, the ex-snowboard professional and self-professed inventor of kiteboarding on skis, on 00 43 66 45 34 19 13. Ice diving What is it? Even absolute beginners can try a 20-minute dive under the ice in a frozen lake. Most of that time is spent near the surface where divers can marvel at the ice formations and shafts of light penetrating the frozen surface. All participants are accompanied by a qualified instructor and have 20 minutes of instruction before trying five short dives. Where? Le Lac, Tignes, France. How much? \u00a3 40 including wet suit and mask. The dives are held every day (except Mondays) between 11am and 4pm. Under-18s must have written parental consent. For more information: Evolution 2 (00 33 4 79 06 43 78). Ski biking What is it? Imagine a bike with skis rather than wheels. The rider has a seat and handlebars and uses short foot-skis instead of pedals. You stop in the same way as you do when you're skiing, by leaning the bike sideways and digging the ski edges in. Where? Vail, Colorado, for organised night-time events starting at 5pm each day. How much? The one and a half-hour ride costs from \u00a335 to \u00a340, depending on the time of the season (usually ends the first week in April). Children have to be at least 12 years old and a minimum of 4ft 6in. It is only suitable for skiers of intermediate level and above. For more information: Adventure Ridge (00 1 970 476 9090). Snowscooting What is it? Take the wheels off a mountain bike and strap it on a snowboard-like contraption and you have a snowscooter. Riding one uses the same techniques as a monoski. Where? It's the latest craze in Les Arcs but also available in other French resorts such as Avoriaz and Les Contamines. How much? In Les Arcs the snowscooters can be hired for half a day at \u00a39 or beginners can receive instruction for \u00a318 an hour. For more information: Virages in Les Arcs 1800 (00 33 4 79 07 78 82) Snow carting What is it? Go-kart bodies mounted on ski runners with steering wheels but no motor. Unlike ski-bikes, the snowcarts have steel-claw brakes. They go fast, but at least you know you will be able to stop. Where? Resorts include Seefeld, Chamonix, Gstaad, Verbier and Grindelwald. How much? \u00a3 43 for up to three hours in Seefeld (minimum 10 people) including instruction and a race. For more information: Fun Factory (00 43 521250900). Parapenting (also called paraponting and paragliding) What is it? Run off a mountain with nothing but a winged parachute and a pair of skis, and you're parapenting. Beginners fly strapped in front of or behind an instructor who uses toggle strings to control the direction and angle of the ascent. It is not for the faint-hearted. Where? European resorts such as Chamonix. How much? It depends how high you want to jump. A flight taking off from mid-station (2,000 metres, or about 6,500ft) costs \u00a348 while the price for jumping at 3,800 metres is \u00a3136. Lift passes are extra. For more information: Evolution 2 (00 33 4 79 06 43 78) and Bigfoot Travel (0870 300 5874) design weekend or week-long parapenting trips to Chamonix.
