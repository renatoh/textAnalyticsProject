Leighton Aspell picked up the spare ride and Nicholls made his feelings known about up-and-coming Brennan's late switch after the marathon race in which he saddled Heros Collonges and Cornish Rebel to finish second and third: \"Brilliant. L'Aventure was fresh and she's done it well. You can see I was a bit frustrated that Paddy [Brennan] didn't stay with her. The other two ran well with big weights. We are all a big team. Everybody plays their part and works hard.\" Nicholls' prizemoney haul of \u00a389,120 for yesterday's race resulted in Ladbrokes going 1-3 about him lifting the trainers' jumps title. Martin Pipe, the 15-times title winner who has won the award for the last 10 seasons, is now out to 9-4. On a day of shocks for the sport, 2-5 favourite Inglis Drever was under pressure and beaten when falling two out in the Long Walk Hurdle, eventually won by My Way De Solzen. Winning owner Jerry Wright said: \"Owing to the fact he must have cut in the ground, I doubt he will be going to the Cheltenham Festival.\" Ron Cox' tip of the day Tribal King 1.55 Newbury The handicapper has shown some leniency towards this lightly raced chaser who is now just 4lbs higher than when last successful. He didn't seem to take to the big fences in the Sefton Chase at Aintree last time but shaped well behind Black De Bessy at Wincanton on his reappearance. He should stay 3m and his stable is in good form."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
