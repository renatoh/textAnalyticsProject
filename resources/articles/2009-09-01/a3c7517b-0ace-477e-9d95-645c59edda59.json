International monitors may not necessarily be able to prevent fraud, but they can expose it, as they have in Afghanistan. The European Union observation mission has been prominent among the bodies charting the faking and ballot-stuffing which marred the vote, as a result of which there may well have to be a second round of voting. Led by the chief observer, Philippe Morillon, a former general and MEP, the EU's team spread itself across the country from eight Afghan cities, a dangerous job. Such observers make a difference, even when refused entry. To reject them, as Iran did, or to hamper their work, as Zimbabwe did, suggests there is something to hide. More people than ever now have the theoretical right to vote their rulers in and out of power. Monitors ensure by and large that polls are fair, or, if they are not, that those who fix them are named and shamed. The OSCE watches over its member states, and will have its eye on Germany next, while two American groups, the Carter Group and the National Democratic Institute, send observers worldwide. Many spend months preparing for polls, trying to educate voters and officials. Carter Group people have already spent a year in Sudan, with another six months to go. Election monitors may only have the right to watch, encourage and speak the truth, but they have the capacity to strip away the democratic disguise which dictators and autocrats so often try to don."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
