Morris, a non-executive member of the ECB board, entered the contest after Somerset's chairman, Giles Clarke, and the ECB's deputy chairman, Mike Soper, tied nine votes each in the original ballot of county chairmen and the MCC. Both Soper and Clarke are understood to have received the nominations they require to run a second time, leaving Morris to find support among the remaining counties before next Monday's deadline. To that end he has written to the chairmen with a \"Message from Morris\" outlining his priorities should he become chairman. These include ensuring the continued success of the England team and extending the ECB's commitment to grassroots cricket. Morris's chances may be hindered by the fact that many chairmen feel obliged to carry through their support for Soper or Clarke from the first round, but his position highlights the insularity of the process. There has been precious little public debate between the candidates, and one of the key issues has been the distribution of lucrative international matches, perfectly illustrating the self-interest of the counties. Morris hopes to broaden the debate, but is not yet certain he will get the chance. \"I am not in a position to say 100% that I will receive the support I need, but I will be very disappointed if I don't make it on to the ballot paper,\" he said. Giles plays it by the book Ashley Giles is the latest member of England's 2005 Ashes-winning side to plan an autobiography, though unlike many of his team-mates he has waited until his career finished before putting pen to paper. Giles, who announced his retirement earlier this summer because of persistent injury, is writing the book without the aid of a ghost writer and has completed half of it. He turned down several offers for ghosted biographies in the wake of England's Ashes success: \"I've always wanted to write this myself. I see it as a new challenge and if my kids read it one day I'd like them to read my own words,\" he said. IAAF's empty protest Ed Warner's attack on the BBC's athletics coverage on the eve of the world championships in Osaka was not the first time UK Athletics' chairman has singled out the corporation for criticism. Last week Warner described the BBC's coverage as stale and tired, but back in June he was equally strident on the subject at a sponsorship conference in London. Then he suggested that the senior executives and presenters involved in athletics broadcasting were marking time until a last hurrah at the London Olympics in 2012, after which they would retire. Warner's approach to the sport since he became chairman eight months ago has been refreshingly frank, even if it has won him few friends in the sport's establishment. The IAAF was unimpressed at being described as complacent, and insiders have suggested that Warner would be better employed assembling a competitive GB team. Looking at the empty seats in Osaka, it is hard to argue with his analysis. Spurs drop the Standard Not content with undermining their manager and alienating supporters, Tottenham's board have turned their attention to their critics in the media, banning London's Evening Standard from home matches and press conferences. Chairman Daniel Levy is thought to have taken particular offence at a critical piece by the former Guardian columnist Matthew Norman, though the club claim the timing is coincidental. Norman has previously attracted the ire of Spurs managers Gerry Francis, David Pleat and the former chairman Alan Sugar, though none of them was petty enough to lock out the paper's football reporters. Should the ban be extended to all voices that have been critical of the shambolic events of the last 10 days there would be no one left in the press box and precious few in the stands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
