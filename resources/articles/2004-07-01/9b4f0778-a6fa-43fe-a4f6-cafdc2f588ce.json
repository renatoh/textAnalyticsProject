Yorkshire are hoping that Dawood, who will be 28 on Friday, can solve their wicket-keeping problems, and the player is excited at the prospect of making his championship bow for the county. \"There is definitely a chance to stake a claim for the wicketkeeping position and I'm hoping to grab it with both hands,\" he said. \"This is a huge opportunity for me and I'm confident that I'm up to the task.\" Dawood, who has played in Yorkshire's one-day team this season, was born in Dewsbury but has been something of a cricketing nomad, playing for Northamptonshire, Worcestershire and Glamorgan before dropping out of the professional ranks in 1999. He is studying for a degree at Leeds Metropolitan University and last summer scored a century against Yorkshire while playing for Bradford-Leeds UCCE."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
