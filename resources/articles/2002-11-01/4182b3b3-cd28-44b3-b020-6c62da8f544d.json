Diary learns that under her new contract, La Lamb is granted six months off each year to write books. This is the same Lamb whose last expenses sheet included a claim for a ludicrously expensive cashmere cardigan. Given the straitened times we live in what News Corp's shareholders will think of such generosity is anyone's guess. That's no stunna, it's my wife Following our report last week that Sun supremo David Yelland was seen quaffing champagne with two 'stunnas' in Claridges, an email arrives from the big man. Dave points out that one stunna was in fact his lovely wife, Tania. The pair were celebrating the fact he has been made a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Arts. Congratulations, Dave. But, er, shouldn't that be 'Fella'? Dream, or is it nightmare? Fascinating article by Daily Telegraph South Africa correspondent Tim Butcher in the Subscriber, Hollinger's free magazine for, yes, subscribers. Tim explains he opted to live in Jo'burg after consulting a Telegraph veteran: 'It's easy to work out there,' roared the vet. 'Just ask two questions - how many dead and which tribe?' This from the same publication that invited readers to win a dream holiday in, erm, South Africa. Did he jump or was he Sached? Diary rings the soon-to-depart Sunday Times business editor Rory Godson for a cosy chat, only to be told he has 'gone'. But where, Diary asks incredulously. There is talk of a monumental bust-up with editor John Witherow, of veiled threats and gnashing of teeth. Diary asks has the maverick Irishman, soon to join Goldman Sachs, burnt his bridges with Murdoch forever? More anon. Ed's new award: the boot For almost two decades top hack Ed Moloney covered events in Northern Ireland for the Sunday Tribune, enduring countless paramilitary death threats. But now the acclaimed author of The Secret History of the IRA finds himself out of a job. The last act of outgoing Tribune editor Matt Cooper was to sack the award-winning Moloney. Brutal world, hackery. PR account up for tender Diary's massive PR account is up for grabs. Current holder Neil Bennett has gone beyond the pale. Not content with applying to become business editor of the Sunday Times, our Neil is now rumoured to be eyeing the top job at the Financial Mail On Sunday. With Diary's stock waning this sort of behaviour is simply unacceptable. A beauty parade is on the cards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
