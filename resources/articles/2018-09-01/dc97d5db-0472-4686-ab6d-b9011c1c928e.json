Police were called to the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, which hosted the fourth annual GRM Daily Rated Awards, shortly after 9pm on Wednesday following reports of a stabbing. A man was taken to a west London hospital by the London ambulance service after being found suffering from multiple stab wounds on Queen Caroline Street, opposite Hammersmith station. No arrests have been made and enquiries continue. A spokesman for the Eventim Apollo told the BBC: \"During an event at the Eventim Apollo, an incident occurred where a male was seriously assaulted. \u201cThe individual received immediate medical care on site and was taken to hospital by ambulance. \u201cThe matter is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police, and we are assisting them with their enquiries.\u201d The comedian Michael Dapaah, producer Steel Banglez and rapper Not3s were among those presented with awards at this year\u2019s ceremony, while grime pioneer D Double E was honoured with the legacy award. Other high-profile attendees at the event included the DJ Tim Westwood, TV presenter Maya Jama and England footballer Jesse Lingard.
