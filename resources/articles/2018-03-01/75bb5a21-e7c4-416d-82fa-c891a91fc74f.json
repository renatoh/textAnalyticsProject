The delay has led opponents to call for offsets \u2013 intended to make up for lost ecosystems \u2013 to be established prior to the destruction taking place. \u201cThis is a mine that was approved on the basis of the promises that were made by Whitehaven for the biodiversity offsets,\u201d said George Woods from Lock the Gate Alliance. \u201cThe clearing that that is supposed to have compensated for happened three years ago \u2013 the community is still waiting for that to be delivered.\u201d Bulldozing has been going on for three years now, despite the offsets intended to protect the ecological communities not being secured. The Maules Creek mine was the subject of a two-year blockade before its construction began, which saw hundreds of people arrested for protesting against the clearing of remnant Leard State Forest. All up, it will involve the clearing of 544 hectares of a forest type called box-gum grassy woodland. It is listed as critically endangered under federal environmental law, with 95% already lost in NSW. It is home to threatened species, including the swift parrot, the regent honeyeater and Corben\u2019s long-eared bat. A Senate committee recommended in 2014 that critically endangered habitats be a \u201cred flag\u201d, indicating that bulldozing and offsetting not be allowed. That committee also recommended that offsets be clearly identified prior to the bulldozing taking place. Those recommendations were not agreed to by the government. The practice of giving extensions to the length of time miners have to find offsets while they continue their bulldozing appears to have become standard practice. This was the second extension Whitehaven received for its Maules Creek project, while Glencore\u2019s Ulan coalmine near Gulgong in NSW has received seven extensions for its offsets since it gained approval in 2010. \u201cThe absurd number of extensions granted to Glencore to finalise the offests for the Ulan mine really points to how little mining companies are about the biodiversity impacts of their coalmines, and how weak the government agencies are in ensuring that the companies meet the promises that they make to get approval,\u201d Woods said. The federal Department of Environment and Energy failed to respond to questions about what consideration is given to requests for extensions of this sort. A spokesman for Whitehaven said the company was in full compliance with its approval requirements and that the extension was required because of the timing of land transfer negotiations. \u201cWhitehaven is proud of its strong record in the implementation of biodiversity offset strategies to protect and restore the environments in which it operates,\u201d the spokesman said. Whitehaven\u2019s offset plans for Maules Creek have a chequered past. The plans it first proposed were found to be flawed, with an independent review finding they needed to be increased by almost a third."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
