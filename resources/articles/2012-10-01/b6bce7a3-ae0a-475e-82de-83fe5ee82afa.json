Levi's Go Forth campaign has traded in its sepia-tinged visions of The Old Days\u2122 in favour of a vision of nowness that's so of-the-moment that it will be o.v.e.r. by the time you finish this sentence. \"This is a pair of Levi's: buttons and rivets and pockets and cuffs,\" says Serious Voiceover Lady, in an insouciantly cool tone that suggests she's reading her little denim poem during a pretentious open-mic night, squeezed in between an ethically sourced fish juggler and a sock puppeteer re-enacting chapter eight of Naomi Wolf's Vagina. In her excitable verse, Little Miss Patti Smithsonian artfully makes the link between wearing a pair of Levi's vein-crushers with the ability to find a cure for cancer and become leader of the free world (subtext: if you sport some Guess? jeans you'll probably only spark up a cure for deep vein thrombosis and are fated to become the leader of your local pop choir). The ad cuts between shots of Real People (translation: eye-wateringly pretty models who last ate in 2005) getting changed into a variety of Levi's couture, and then walking down the street en route to big, career-making moments. Levi's new campaign might be very cool and all but it's also so exhaustingly melodramatic that it'll make most of us want to hide behind the metaphorical changing-room curtain of life, stuffing our faces with ice-cream as we watch the latest episode of The Great British Bake Off, wearing jeans with an elasticated waistband. A pair of which, if we're being honest, is probably not in Levi's new range. Watch the ad here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
