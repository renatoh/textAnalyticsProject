The guided weapons produced by the Germans in the last months of the war were the forerunners of today's precision bombs; and the moon landings were made possible by scientists who had worked with Wernher von Braun on the V2 rocket. Hartcup argues that Britain soon grasped \"the importance of close collaboration between scientists and the military\", a lesson the Wehrmacht was slow to learn. And while Hitler was opposed to the use of biological weapons, Churchill planned to drop 500,000 anthrax bombs on Germany in 1944. Hartcup's concise survey, from radar and computerised cryptoanalysis to the atomic bomb, provides an excellent introduction to relations between the boffins and the men in khaki. Information Arts: Intersections of Art, Science and Technology, by Stephen Wilson (MIT, \u00a319.95) Is this art or science: a computer display that visualises intellectual structures in articles and books; mice bred with a taste for computer cables; a transgenic dog created using genes from green fluorescent bacteria? Surprisingly, the last two are not from a lab but an artist's studio. They are part of what Wilson calls \"information arts\", a \"new kind of conceptual art\" that blurs the boundaries between art and science. Paints and video were once state-of-the-art technologies; but in the 21st century genetics and robotics will form the medium and the message. A Renaissance vision of the unity of the arts and sciences inspires Wilson's fascinating survey of the art world's love affair with science. Nanotechnology is already letting artists \"play God in creating atomic-level machines\", but Wilson predicts that \"the sculpture of the future may well be bioengineering\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
