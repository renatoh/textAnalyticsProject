Middlesbrough made an inquiry about buying the England midfielder and although Manchester United were happy to do business, the player has decided he wants to remain at the club and fight for a first-team place. \"Nicky Butt is a player I've always admired, no two ways about it,\" said McClaren yesterday. \"But my understanding of the latest position with Nicky is that he is staying at Old Trafford and that's the end of it.\" One player likely to be signing for Middlesbrough is Danny Mills. The sometime England right-back is on a season-long loan from Leeds and, although McClaren fears his efforts to obtain the player's registration this month may be doomed, he is confident of securing his transfer in the summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
