Ask any critic what is the best football match in a British movie and they'll say the one refereed by Brian Glover in Ken Loach's Kes, and what is the most absurd sports film ever and they're likely to name John Huston's prison-camp flick, Victory. Now, at last, we have a big-budget soccer movie, Goal!, the work of a British director and British writers, though with a Mexican hero (Kuno Becker) and the principal British football star impersonated by an American (Alessandro Nivola). The first film in a trilogy, Goal! is much superior to the recent and comparable Wimbledon, but much inferior to the equally comparable Cinderella Man. It's essentially a soft-centred fairy story that pulls out every predictable stop and pulls in every sports movie clich\u00e9. The hero, Santiago Munez, a naive 20-year-old Mexican wetback, is spotted playing for an amateur team in Los Angeles by an idealistic former Newcastle United star (Stephen Dillane). With the help of his grandma, but opposed by his hard-working father, Munez heads for a trial at Newcastle and a shot at the big time. There are setbacks due to a hostile Scottish fellow player, the lad's difficulty in adapting to the British weather, a foolish decision to conceal his asthma and a compromising photograph on the front page of the Sun. But within a matter of weeks, he's in the first team, playing alongside Alan Shearer and, in the last minute of the last game of the season, he's given the opportunity to score from a free kick with the score 2-2. Well, no movie-goer wants to see a winning goal scored in the first five minutes. The most striking visuals come with sweeping helicopter shots of the elegant bridges on the photogenic Tyne, ending up at St James' Park, a building in this context as grand as the Colosseum. These are more impressive than the computer-enhanced games themselves. And everyone - the fans, the other players, the staff, the spectators - are kind and warm-hearted, with the exception of a self-seeking agent (Sean Pertwee) who has no real love for the game. The chief pussycat is the philosophical, paternalistic German manager, an Arsene Wenger figure very well played by Marcel Iures. He does everything short of tucking up his players in bed with: 'Auf Wiedersehen, pet'. This is an odd omission because the screenplay is by the Los Angeles-based British sitcom team of Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement, authors of the two great Geordie comedy series, The Likely Lads and indeed Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. For many people, the highlight of the movie will be David Beckham approaching the hero at a post-match party in London to say: 'Santiago, you were great today.' This is the screen's most underwhelming sporting moment since some 40 years ago when Graham Hill came up to Yves Montand in Grand Prix and said: 'Congratulations on the race this afternoon, Jean-Pierre.' The week's other British movie, Blinded, the feature debut of writer-director Eleanor Yule, is a glum, psychological melodrama. The setting is a rundown country house in a remote corner of Scotland where blind, middle-aged farmer Peter Mullan lives with his abused, sex-starved young wife (Jodhi May) and his senile mother (Phyllida Law). A good-looking Danish backpacker (Anders W Berthelsen) is taken on as oddjob man, and before the postman has had time to ring once, the Dane and the girl are lovers and the blind brute has been drowned in a convenient pool of quicksand at the bottom of the garden. Not exactly British, but partly funded by the UK Film Council with lottery money, Lucile Hadzihalilovic's Innocence is also the feature debut of a female film-maker and is set on a weird bit of countryside, in this case, an enclosed estate somewhere in France. Adapted from a 1888 story by Frank Wedekind (author of Spring Awakening), it's a dreamlike allegory about the approach of puberty. Five groups of girls aged from six to 11, all dressed in white (short-pleated skirts, blouses, jackets, long stockings), study ballet and natural sciences under two teachers in their thirties, and are waited on at meals by anonymous white-haired old women. In the school's basement, entered via a grandfather clock, there's a theatre where older girls perform for unseen visitors, and a railway station that transports school-leavers to a semi-adult world of teenagers who sport around fountains as in a German picture of the 1930s. Great claims have been made for this movie. I found it distinctly creepy and wonder about the kind of audiences it might attract. In the equally odd and confused Vital, a young Japanese student suffers from amnesia after an accident in which his girlfriend is killed. He returns to his medical studies and his memory gradually comes back when he finds himself in an anatomy class spending weeks dissecting his girlfriend's corpse. This leads to encounters with her grieving parents, to fantasies of the life he and their daughter might have had together and to questions about the body and the nature of consciousness. An intriguing situation that would have been handled more interestingly by David Cronenberg. The week's other Asian film, Kang Woo-suk's Another Public Enemy, is a wildly overlong tale of vigilanteism from Korea. A violent, maverick prosecutor breaks all the rules as he obsessively pursues a crooked, homicidal property tycoon who remains beyond the reach of the law. 'Do you know why Robin Hood became an outlaw?' he asks a cautious, law-respecting superior. The vigilante as hero is also to be found in John Singleton's Four Brothers. Singleton made his name overnight at Cannes with his 1992 debut Boyz N the Hood, a compassionate account of young, black men growing up or going to early graves in the gang culture of south central Los Angeles, with a particular concern for the absence of positive, male role models in the community. He has made little of comparable merit since and is now a gun for hire in action movies such as 2 Fast 2 Furious. In his new movie, four brothers (two black, two white, the adopted children of a Detroit woman played by Fionnula Flanagan) gather after her funeral to seek revenge on whoever killed her during a cornerstore holdup. As the corrupt and lazy local police look on, they pursue leads that take them from one violent encounter to the next before confronting Mr Big (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who has cops and politicians in his pocket. Both sides kill without compunction, frequently in cold blood. The setting being the run-up to Christmas, one imagines the local morgue ran out of bodybags and had to requisition Santa sacks from Detroit's department stories. A sequel to the 1999 comedy, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo dispatches its deeply unattractive hero (Rob Schneider) to Amsterdam, where his pimp chum (Eddie Griffin) is suspected of being a serial killer who targets male prostitutes. It's a succession of jokes about penises, farting, sexual positions, homophobia, coprophagy, badly delivered and cumulatively unfunny. Crudely lewd rather than lightly ludic, the film aspires to being the poor man's The Aristocrats, and might well have been called 'The Plebeians'. Distinguished Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbe returned to Holland to play the chief heavy, which is rather like Anthony Hopkins coming home to appear in Sex Lives of the Potato Men."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
