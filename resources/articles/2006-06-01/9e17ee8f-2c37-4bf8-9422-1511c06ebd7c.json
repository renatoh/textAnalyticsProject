Do I need to use a conveyancing specialist, as stated by my solicitor who is handling the completion of my divorce, or could I do this myself? I am on a tight budget and did not take this extra cost into consideration. SO A I am not sure that you do need to use a specialist conveyancer. Conveyancing is the process of transferring ownership of a property from one person (or company) to another. Since yours is the only name on the title deeds - and presumably also the only name mentioned on the record held by the Land Registry (you can check at www.landregistry.gov.uk for a \u00a32 fee) - there will be no transfer of ownership and so no need for a conveyance to take place. However, taking your ex-husband's name off the mortgage does mean that the mortgage documents need to be changed, which may involve some legal work. I suggest you talk to your lender about what is involved. Even if some legal work is involved that you have to pay for, it is usually cheaper - and sometimes costs nothing - to use a lender's legal person rather than engaging your own."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
