And, reportedly, the number of misplaced votes that would have changed the destination of the 2012 Olympics (that of the Greek IOC member Lambis Nikolaou, who apparently meant to vote for Madrid in the penultimate vote but pressed Paris instead). 2 All Black players needed to end the captain Brian O'Driscoll's participation in the Lions' tour (Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu, one on each leg). 3 Red cards shown to David Beckham this season (two for Real Madrid, one for England). England international swimmers who have changed nationalities this year (Zoe Baker now swims for New Zealand, Robin Francis for South Africa, Jo Fargus for Australia. All could be at the Commonwealth Games.) 4 Gold medals sacrificed by Dwain Chambers when he admitted in a BBC interview this month that he was taking the designer steroid THG in 2002, when Britain's sprint relay team won gold at the European championships. He lost one more medal, as did his team-mates Christian Malcolm, Marlon Devonish and Darren Campbell (having already lost their 2003 world championship relay medals). 6 Number of test samples containing the banned blood booster EPO which the French sports daily L'Equipe alleged were submitted by Lance Armstrong during his first Tour de France victory in 1999 - an allegation fiercely denied by the American. 7 Height in feet of new the WBA world heavyweight champion Nicolay Valuev (reports vary from 7ft to 7ft 2in). The Russian, known as the Beast from the East, weighs in at 336lb. He won the title by beating John Ruiz on points. 8 World and Olympic titles won by the yachtsman Ben Ainslie, 28. He has won two world and one Olympic at laser and four world and one Olympic at Finn. His fourth Finn title was unprecedented. 9 Sixes struck by Flintoff in the second Ashes Test at Edgbaston. In his two innings there, Flintoff struck 141 runs in 148 balls. 10 The number of races it took Paula Radcliffe to win a world or Olympic title. She finally succeeded at the Helsinki world championships where she struck gold in the marathon. 11 Titles won by Roger Federer in 2005. He also won 35 straight matches, amassed a win-loss record of 81-4 and increased his bank balance by more than $6m. 12 Rough amount (in inches) the ball was moved by Colin Montgomerie in the Indonesian Open, after an overnight stoppage due to an electric storm. Monty was sure he put it back in the correct spot, others less so - particularly when the before and after camera footage emerged. Monty gave his prize money to charity but could not do the same with his ranking points, which he needed to get into the US Open. 13 British international swimmers who have retired since the Athens Olympics. 15 \"Degrees of flexion\" exceeded by Pakistani Shabbir Ahmed's bowling action in the recent Test series against England, causing him to be banned for a year by the International Cricket Council. 19 Number of Christmas cards sent by Jose Mourinho to Premiership managers. England matches (ie all of them) missed by Jonny Wilkinson through injury since the 2003 World Cup. 29 Prison sentence (in months) given to the German referee Robert Hoyzer, who accepted \u20ac67,000 and an expensive television set to fix match results by awarding dubious penalties, wrongly issuing red cards, etc. The betting syndicate paying Hoyzer would communicate by ringing him in his dressing room at half-time. 32 Years of pain suffered by the Socceroos, who had not qualified for the World Cup finals since 1974. Guus Hiddink, having worked miracles with South Korea in 2002, worked a few more to get the Australians past Uruguay and even scare Sven-Goran Eriksson, who said he did not want to meet them in the group stage. 88 Years of pain suffered by the Chicago White Sox, who had not won baseball's World Series since 1917 until their 4-0 white-sox-wash over Houston in October. 36,856 Finishers in the New York Marathon, taking the world record from London. Bad news for runners in next year's London marathon, as the race director Dave Bedford is bound to want the record back and that means the entire race will grind to a halt in the Docklands bottleneck. 1 million Estimated prize money, in dollars, that the banned sprinter Tim Montgomery will not be returning to the athletics authorities. \"If I tested positive I would give every penny back but someone telling them I told something? Come on, this is not high school,\" said Montgomery. 10 million Estimated total cost in pounds of the Lions' unsuccessful summer tour to New Zealand. Each touring Lion was paid around \u00a320,000 for his troubles, with little in the way of bonus money. 75 million The dollar-worth of the Chinese basketball star Yao Ming's new five-year contract with the Houston Rockets. Which works out at $833,333 per inch (Ming is 7ft 6in).
