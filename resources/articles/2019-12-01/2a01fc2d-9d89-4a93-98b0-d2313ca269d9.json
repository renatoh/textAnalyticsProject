She got one of the rare laughs from the audience as she icily cut into a question from Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, to Richard Burgon, the Labour representative, asking whether he thought a better deal could be negotiated than remaining in the EU. \u201cNo,\u201d Sturgeon said. \u201cNo. There is no deal better than staying in the EU.\u201d Richard Burgon, Labour Burgon started off a bit hesitantly when attacked over Labour\u2019s policy on sentencing and the party\u2019s Brexit position, but he warmed up with a series of strong attacks on the Tories over their threat to the NHS. He also delivered a zinger against Nigel Farage when calling him out for demanding independence when there is \u201cnothing independent about taking instruction from Donald Trump when he rings up LBC\u201d. Adam Price, Plaid Cymru Price came into his own when he attacked Farage for his defence of Trump. He stated it was never acceptable for someone to boast of \u201cgrabbing women by the pussy\u201d and said he was offended as a gay man by Boris Johnson\u2019s comments about \u201cbumboys in tank tops\u201d. \u201cNeither Trump or Boris Johnson are fit to be in public life,\u201d he said. OK night Jo Swinson, Lib Dem leader Swinson delivered the strongest opening statement, saying Johnson \u201ccan\u2019t be bothered to talk to you tonight and is leaving it to his cheerleader\u201d. She said the prime minister \u201cpicks on people weaker than himself\u201d and stokes divisions. However, her performance in the debate was somehow flatter than on Friday night, when she made a strong appearance on the BBC seven-way debate. Si\u00e2n Berry, Green leader Berry delivered a necessary message about tackling the climate emergency but she struggled to get airtime amid louder voices jostling for attention. Bad night Rishi Sunak, Conservative Cheesy and wooden, Sunak did not make any major slip-ups but he struggled to cut through and his lines all sounded precooked. However, the Conservatives are likely to be relieved that he got through the two hours without incident while delivering the key campaign messages. Nigel Farage, Brexit party The Brexit party leader had a clear run at attacking both the Conservatives and Labour for being \u201cweak on sentencing\u201d. He delivered populist lines about wanting to bang up terrorists for life, and blaming the \u201cliberal elite\u201d and \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d for terrorists being released halfway through their sentences, without much direct challenge from the other parties. Farage has been delivering such rightwing stump speeches for decades and his confidence showed. But he came unstuck defending Trump, saying some of his sexist comments are the kind of thing men say \u201cafter a night out with a drink\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
