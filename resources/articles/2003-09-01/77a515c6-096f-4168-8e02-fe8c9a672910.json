This victory put the champions back on top of the table after Celtic, who beat Livingston 5-1 on Saturday, enjoyed brief elevation, while even at this stage new-look Dundee United, who included eleven new signings in their squad, are becoming serious candidates for relegation. The Tayside team did enjoy a decent second half during which Stefan Klos twice brilliantly denied the former Ranger Charlie Miller. But this was eventually another comfortable win for Rangers whose travelling fans saw Emerson make his debut as a substitute but who will have to wait until after international week to see Egil Ostenstad, signed from Blackburn Rovers over the weekend, make his first appearance. Both will gain match fitness for the Ibrox Under-21 team against Dundee United tonight. Rangers will get more from the pair in due course but for the moment they have successfully negotiated their first hurdle without their inspirational captain Barry Ferguson, now at Ewood Park. Nuno Capucho's first goal for the club after 13 minutes indicated that this would be the ideal afternoon for Rangers following the midweek exertions that took them past FC Copenhagen and into the Champions League. Indeed it should have worked out that way but the United goalkeeper Tony Bullock produced fine saves to thwart Ronald de Boer and Michael Mols. That left the home team retaining genuine hope of causing an upset and they felt their second half performance should have given them at least a point. In a hectic finale the former Ibrox player Billy Dodds deservedly equalised after 82 minutes with his first touch just 29 seconds after replacing Barry Robson. But within three minutes Shota Arveladze made it 2-1 and two minutes from time a Mikel Arteta penalty sealed the victory. \"What a week,\" exclaimed the Rangers manager Alex McLeish. \"We showed great resilience and character. We have done really well over the last few days.\" United's manager Ian McCall insisted: \"We gave Rangers a doing in the second half and I thought it would be us who would get a winner.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
