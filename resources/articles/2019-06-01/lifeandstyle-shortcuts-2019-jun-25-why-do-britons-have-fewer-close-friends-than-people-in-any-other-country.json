In Britain, it seems to be a question of why we don\u2019t have more. A global study of 10,000 people by Snapchat has found that Britons have fewer \u201cbest friends\u201d \u2013 2.6 on average \u2013 than those in other countries. In Saudi Arabia, participants reported 6.6 best friends on average. But do we really need any more? According to the MIT Technology Review, humans can cope with a maximum of five friends in their closest friendship circle. Meanwhile, Robin Dunbar, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, found in a 2016 study of 27,000 European phone-call logs that, on average, each person studied had 4.1 intimate relationships. So, how does the amount of close friends we have affect our lives? We took to the streets to find out. Alvin Jones, 70 Best friends: one \u201cA best friend is someone who will always tell you the truth, no matter how bad it is. My best friend, Doug, is someone whom I\u2019ve grown up with: we lived in flats opposite each other when we were five years old. He\u2019s now the godfather to my two children and is the brother I\u2019ve never had. Sadly, we\u2019re in a bit of a rough patch at the moment, because of our opposing views on Brexit, but I hope we can patch things up.\u201d Caroline Hamlett, 32 Best friends: five \u201cI lived with three of my best friends at university, but now they don\u2019t get along with each other, so I have individual relationships with them. When I get married in a few months, I\u2019ll be having only one bridesmaid, my sister, but I still want everyone there.\u201d Ted Allott, 30 Best friends: three \u201cSometimes it feels as if the only way I stay in touch with my best mates is through tagging them in social media posts. As you get older, your relationships dwindle, especially since we are all so focused on work.\u201d Rich Smith, 60 Best friends: four \u201cI\u2019ve lived all over the world, from being born and raised in England to moving to Australia and now raising my family in Taiwan, so my friends reflect that. All four of us go on holiday at least once a year without our wives and they\u2019re the people I trust most.\u201d MJ, 25 Best friends: four \u201cAll of my best friends serve different purposes in my life: some are childhood mates whom I can talk to at any time, others are friends I have a good time with and have met more recently \u2013 you need different people to rely on. I\u2019m not surprised that people here are finding it harder to make and maintain close friendships, though: it\u2019s such a divisive political climate. It seems easier than ever to fall out.\u201d Aneta Gesiorska, 28 Best friends: one \u201cI moved to the UK five years ago from Poland and my best friend still lives there. We\u2019ve known each other since we were seven and we still talk regularly \u2013 she\u2019s coming to visit next week. She hates it here, though, and would never move.\u201d Taylor Long, 20 Best friends: zero \u201c\u2018Best friend\u2019 is an outdated term; I\u2019m close with all of my friends and I wouldn\u2019t consider that I have one, or a few, who are more special than others. It\u2019s important to have lots of people around, as you never know where life will take you.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
