And he doesn't like the word jazz much either, although he's a DJ who has spent his life promoting music that fits into either, or both, of these categories, along with anything from soul to hip-hop, ambient styles or electronics. \"I always thought world music was a put-offa\" he explains. \"It's too much of a stereotype. And jazz is not a word you can use, but it's important music, so just slip it in. Maybe one of the reasons for my survival is that I don't ever throw my entire body into one particular term. It's hard to place me.\" He went on to enthuse about early recordings by the Nigerian star, the late Fela Kuti, describe a recent British tour on which his \"regular Gilles Peterson student club DJ set\" was combined with live \"brilliant free jazz\" from drummer Steve Reid, who has worked with everyone from Fela Kuti to John Coltrane, and then to discuss the wild, distorted traditional sound of the Congolese band Konono Number One, his choice as album of the year. Peterson is no newcomer, for it's been 20 years since he started out on the pirate radio scene in south London, but he's one of the few true champions of eclectic global music, as shown by his forthcoming Worldwide music awards, now upgraded from London's Cargo to Koko in Camden (where Madonna made both her recent London appearances). Since the death of John Peel, there's been much talk about the great man's all-embracing musical taste and bravery, but little sign that radio's national controllers want to continue his experiments. There are some excellent world music shows, including Andy Kershaw's adventurous mix, but they exist on Radio 3. Folk music (also once championed by Peel) is on Radio 2, and that leaves Peterson as the one varied, global and experimental music enthusiast on Radio 1. He's well aware of the privilege. \"It's a brilliant position. I can push techno alongside avant-garde jazz; the only other person with such carte blanche was John Peel.\" So how does he react to comparisons made between them? \"We were opposite to each other in terms of musical taste. But his approach was important for being unconventional. He was into energy and was rebellious - but I'm not quite like that.\" Peterson is sitting in his studio in Finsbury Park, north London, surrounded by CDs and vinyl. It's here that he records radio shows that are broadcast across the world, from Dubai to New Zealand, Belgrade, or that excellent eclectic Parisian station, Radio Nova. According to Peterson, \"Radio Nova were my biggest inspiration, more so than Peel. Because they played this m\u00e9lange, and had a blackness that wasn't there with Peel.\" How would he describe his mix? \"My history is black music and jazz. But as dance music has become more wide and crazy, I've been excited by new areas, like minimal electronic music from Germany or a new jazz trio from New York ...\" His Worldwide awards will be \"a celebration of that philosophy\", and what he likes to call \"the worldwide movement, not the world music movement\" of those who share his taste. Listeners to his Radio 1 show have been invited to vote for favourite new bands or clubs, and 40 DJs from around the world will play \"one record each\". Appearing live will be Fat Freddy's Drop, the New Zealand band that features a soulful Maori singer and reggae influences, and has become something of a world music crossover success. Then there will be Japan's Soil and Pimp Sessions, described by Peterson as \"a cross between the Lounge Lizards and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, with the energy of the Ramones thrown in. And they look great. Japan is where it's at!\" Peterson's rise to become an international DJ and taste-maker (his term) started in humble style. He's half-French, and was brought up in Sutton, south of London. At school in the early 1980s, he defied the punk fashion to become a soul boya \"one of only three in the school, and I only got away with it because I was in the rugby team\". He managed to find soul imports in Sutton market and started his own DIY pirate radio station. Programmes were recorded in his garden shed and then, with help from his dad, the results were broadcast from Epson Downs \"by putting up an antenna and connecting it to the car battery. We then took calls from listeners in the local phone box.\" He never looked back, even when his parents returned to the Continent without him when he was 16. He worked as a DJ across south London, and was heavily involved in the growing pirate radio scene. It was, he saysa \"a very exciting, edgy time\", especially as the potential for hefty profits led to growing rivalry between the pirates. He remembers broadcasting from above a hairdresser's in Crystal Palace \"and we got raided and another station nicked all our gear\". In the process, he acquired his musical education. He first heard a John Coltrane record as a teenager \"at a Soul Weekender held at a holiday camp in Norfolk\", and first heard Fela Kuti being played at the Electric Ballroom in Camden. He says that \"as a club DJ playing jazz and funk and black and dance music, it was inevitable that I'd come across Puerto Rico, Cuba, Brazil and Africa\". Along with the DJ work came his involvement in the record industry, from the Acid Jazz label to the influential Talkin' Loud, which he founded in 1990 and which will be remembered for its adventurous roster that ranged from Courtney Pine and Roni Size to hip-hop celebrities, the Roots. He quit to concentrate full-time on DJ work after noting the rise of DJ culture. \"I was coming from an earlier generation\" he admits. \"I was the last person to realise how powerful the DJ was.\" As a DJ, he has kept the Peterson CDs coming, with a series of compilations. Last year there was Gilles Peterson in Brazil, followed this year by Gilles Peterson in Africa, which again included one CD of original recordings matched against another of sometimes less interesting remixes (why bother to play around with Cesaria Evora if the result isn't as good as the original?). Now there's yet another very different double-album set, Gilles Peterson's BBC Sessions, with contributions from the likes of Bj\u00f6rk, Fat Freddy's Drop and Nitin Sawhney, who played his tribute to the DJ, Gilles Smiles. The album was promoted by a concert at the Barbican last month featuring a far less exotic line-up. And next? He's launching a new label, to be called either Quiet Fire or Brownswood, \"just as a hobby\", and has started recording the Heritage Orchestra for that. Then there are the continuing global DJ sessions, soon to include a visit to Argentina, and before all that, of course, those Worldwide awards. \"I have a responsibility to break new music because there are so few areas where new music can get exposed at the moment,\" says Peterson. Even if one doesn't always share his taste, it's impossible not to applaud. \u00b7 Gilles Peterson's Worldwide music awards are at Koko, London NW1, on Monday. Gilles Peterson in Africa and Gilles Peterson's BBC Sessions are on Ether Records. Details: bbc.co.uk/radio1"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
