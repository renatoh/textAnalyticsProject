Over the past two years more than a dozen funds have sacked their managers - including large ones like TR Property and Edinburgh Investment Trust - and now shareholders in Securities Trust of Scotland are facing a hostile bid from Perpetual Growth &amp; Income. With experts predicting that bids and management changes will be a regular feature, 'energetic' would be a more appropriate epithet. On the face of it, the bid from Pigit, as Perpetual is affectionately known, is a clear winner. While STS's net asset value - the jargon term for the value of the assets owned by the trust - has dropped by 3 per cent over the last five years (including the value of its dividends), Pigit has produced an 85 per cent total return for its shareholders over the same period. STS's discount (the difference between the net asset value and its share price and a key indicator of how investors view trusts) has averaged 15.1 per cent, while Pigit's has been just 4.3 per cent. Pigit's dividends have grown faster and it has beaten its sector average for the last five years, while STS has lagged behind it. Indeed, on virtually every measure of performance that counts, Pigit wins. Pigit approached STS last summer about a friendly deal but was turned down and, despite lobbying by some of its shareholders, STS has continued to resist the approach. But Pigit's interest has been enough to spur it into action. It has repaid some of its expensive borrowings and is already changing the way it manages its investments. Instead of effectively tracking the index, it is taking some bigger bets. That has produced a better result: since December, STS has grown by 8.08 per cent, compared with 6.73 per cent for the market and 6.95 per cent for Pigit. And it has appointed a new manager, Ross Watson, who formerly ran Murray Income at Aberdeen Asset Management. His record there is better than STS's but behind Perpetual's, producing a 44 per cent return, in NAV terms, over the last five years. But these changes are unlikely to be enough to save STS. Three months of good performance may be a flash in the pan and there is no guarantee that Watson, who starts work tomorrow, can deliver the goods. Yet STS is already hinting that it has more to offer: in a statement last week, it pointed out that, because it has a more generous dividend yield than Pigit, accepting the offer would cut investors' income by between 20 and 30 per cent. And it said it was 'reviewing its options with the aim of delivering best value for all shareholders'. Its proposals are likely to be revealed in the next two weeks but, if previous investment trust bids are anything to go by, its defence is likely to include things like an offer to buy back some of its shares, allowing disaffected investors to get out, and a commitment to allow a vote on whether to wind the trust up in, say, five years if its new strategy has not produced results. STS shareholders have nothing to lose by waiting for these proposals to be announced before deciding what to do. Charles Cade, investment trust analyst at Close Brothers, points out that hostile bids for investment trusts rarely succeed - and with 12,000 private investors to persuade, it will be hard work getting the majority required. At the very least, however, STS investors should see the performance of their trust improve. Mick Gilligan at Killick &amp; Co thinks there are likely to be more bids as fund managers look for ways to boost their fee income at a time when there is little new retail investment into investment or unit trusts. He adds that new rules have forced trusts to state explicitly that they are happy with their manager and strategy in annual reports - a requirement that is forcing many to recognise, and do something to improve, under-performance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
