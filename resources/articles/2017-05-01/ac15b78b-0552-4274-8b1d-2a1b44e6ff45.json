The couple came fifth in the husbands and wives section of the latest Sunday Times Rich List, which ranks the 1,000 richest people in Britain and will be published in full on Sunday. The Greens were the only couple on the list whose wealth dropped over the past year, to \u00a32.8bn. BHS, the department store chain formerly owned by Green, plunged into administration just more than a year ago, affecting 11,000 jobs and around 19,000 pension holders. After a long public row, Green, also boss of retail empire Arcadia, agreed to pay \u00a3363m to rescue the BHS pension scheme in February. But the billionaire has been warned that he could still be stripped of his knighthood. The value of Green\u2019s Arcadia stake has also dropped because of falling sales, reduced assets and a ballooning pension deficit. Ernesto and Kirsty Bertarelli are the UK\u2019s richest couple, with a combined wealth of \u00a311.5bn, and ranked sixth on the Sunday Times general list. Their fortune stems from the sale of the family biotech firm, Serono, and the soaring value of their stake in another pharma business, Santhera. The couple own the largest superyacht built in the UK \u2013 named Vava II, a birthday present for Kirsty from Ernesto, who is a double winner of the America\u2019s Cup. Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, the daughter of late Heineken boss Freddy Heineken, and her banker husband Michel de Carvalho came second on the husband and wife list, with their wealth estimated at \u00a39.3bn. De Carvalho-Heineken has a stake in the Dutch brewing company valued at nearly \u00a38.5bn. They are more than twice as rich as Alejandro Santo Domingo and Charlotte Wellesley, who made their debut in the rich list as the third richest couple, with a fortune of \u00a33.9bn. The 40-year-old scion of Colombia\u2019s richest family, which holds a big stake in the giant US beer company Anheuser-Busch, married Wellesley, the 26-year-old daughter of the Duke of Wellington, last May. In fourth place, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault and Salma Hayek, are worth \u00a33.4bn. Pinault runs the luxury fashion group Kering whose brands include Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen. The Mexican-born actress Hayek is set to appear in four films this year and earns about \u00a312m a year from her work. The 10 richest husbands and wives in the UK are worth nearly \u00a340bn in total and have seen their fortune increase by a combined \u00a33.4bn in the past 12 months. Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List 2017, said this year\u2019s wealth ranking \u201cwill show how the makeup of Britain\u2019s richest 1,000 people is changing \u2013 with a record number of women and more husband and wife partnerships than before\u201d. \u201cStarting a business with your other half may not appeal to everyone. A bit of pillow talk about balance sheets wouldn\u2019t suit all marriages, but there are clearly some couples who are making it work \u2013 and very well.\u201d He added: \u201cThe growing number of women we\u2019re seeing in the Rich List is part of a greater diversity, with more people from ethnic backgrounds and more surprising walks of life, with soft-toy makers and dating-app developers lining up with private-equity barons and hedge-fund managers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
