Successful youth policies at international level have yielded an enviable bounty of talent for France, Portugal and even Ireland but it is perhaps a telling statistic that Trevor Sinclair won his first cap against Sweden on Saturday three empty years since last pulling on an England shirt for the under-21s, something he had previously done a full two years earlier. Sinclair is widely thought to have blown his chance on the musical chair that is left midfield; the next hopeful to try out appeared for his country last Friday and will do so again tonight. Blackburn's David Dunn starts on the left for England Under-21s in the second leg of their European Championship qualifying play-off against Holland in Derby, having scored a stunning goal in last week's 2-2 draw in the first leg. Along with Tottenham's centre-back Ledley King and the West Ham midfielder Michael Carrick, who has already had a taste of the senior squad, Dunn is thought the most likely of the youngsters to graduate for the pre-World Cup friendly programme which begins in February. \"There is no doubt he's a better central midfielder,\" said the England Under-21 coach David Platt. \"But he's interpreting an unfamiliar role very well and did it perfectly in the second half on Friday. The role is not that of a left winger, ploughing a furrow up and down the touchline. Just as, for example, David Beckham, is not a right winger. \"Dunn's characteristics, to me, aren't suited to playing as a left-winger, so what we worked on was getting him into areas where he is most effective, which is offensively and central.\" That allows Dunn to score goals, as he did in Utrecht last week, and also by netting twice in Blackburn's 3-3 draw at Arsenal last month. \"Sven-Goran Eriksson has seen him a few times and has obviously liked what he saw,\" said Platt. \"And I think he's got the ability, mentality and the attitude to impress in the role. As far as the final World Cup squad is concerned, it will depend on what Sven wants to do in terms of covering the positions but it will not harm David that he can play more than one role.\" Eriksson confirmed his interest: \"I have always said that, without making any commitments, we would probably look at one, two or three players in February from the under-21 squad. David Dunn might be one. I've seen him three times this season and twice he played outside left and did well. \"Maybe he is not a natural outside left but the goal he scored for the under-21s was top-class. I also saw him score twice for Blackburn at Highbury, which is not bad at all.\" An ability to play more than one role may also work in King's favour when Eriksson names his final 22 for Japan and South Korea. King, whose partnership with Dean Richards at the heart of the Spurs defence has made the defection of Sol Campbell to Arsenal less of a bitter pill for fans, is another youngster tipped by Platt as capable of gate-crashing the senior party. And not only, irony of ironies, is King posing a threat to the injury-plagued Campbell and his ageing Arsenal colleague Martin Keown, he is capable of challenging or acting as cover for Ashley Cole at left back. By contrast, a lack of versatility may count against Carrick, an engine in central midfield. Not so his attitude. Carrick, a regular member of recent senior England squads, missed out on another against Sweden because he was needed to help the under-21s. \"The gaffer [Platt] pulled me to one side and just said he wanted me to play for the under-21s to help them get through. He also said it would be a good experience for me and although I was disappointed not to be involved with the seniors, I have to take it as a compliment. \"Whether I'll get back in the senior squad for the World Cup is difficult to predict. There's still a long season ahead in which anything can happen.\" \"It was not that long ago that I was playing on loan at Swindon and then Birmingham City,\" Carrick added, \"so you've got to take things as they come. Hopefully, if I'm playing well enough at the end of the season I'll be involved. If not then I'll take it on the chin and be even more determined to make the next one.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
