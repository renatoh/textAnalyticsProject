The most  difficult question for journalists to answer", "bodyText": "Journalists learn from their first day in the trade that their articles should include the five Ws: who, what, where, when and why. The first four are straightforward enough, objective truths if you like. The fifth, however, often travels into subjective territory. It is frustrated by obfuscation and therefore results in speculation. Sometimes, despite our best efforts, it simply goes unanswered. Consider three examples. Why were journalists Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey arrested? Why did the BBC\u2019s otherwise excellent documentary on Margaret Thatcher omit one of the defining moments in her reign as prime minister? Why do broadcasters go on using vox pops? In the absence of rational definitive answers to these questions, I will feel free to speculate. You may disagree with my viewpoint, but this exercise is all about showing how difficult it can be to supply the \u201cwhy\u201d part of our truth-telling journalistic mission. Why did police really arrest two journalists? Birney and McCaffrey were arrested in dawn raids in August last year. Their computers, phones and paperwork were confiscated. After the raids, carried out by Durham Constabulary on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, they were placed on police bail on the grounds they had, allegedly, stolen a confidential document. The two reporters had obtained \u2013 not stolen \u2013 that document while helping to make a film, No Stone Unturned, about the murders of six men in a bar in Loughinisland, County Down, in June 1994. Their documentary mounted evidence that the killers, members of a loyalist paramilitary gang, the UVF, had escaped justice because at least one of them was a police informer. Birney and McCaffrey, in company with the National Union of Journalists, saw this as a gross attack on press freedom. They challenged the legality of the warrants and, thankfully, they were vindicated by two judges in Belfast high court, and then, nine days ago, by Northern Ireland\u2019s lord chief justice, Declan Morgan, who ruled that the pair had acted in a \u201cperfectly proper manner\u201d to protect their sources. This victory for journalism should be seen in the context of a 48-year history of similar assaults on press freedom by police in Northern Ireland. Judges have repeatedly found in reporters\u2019 favour and against the police where they have been arrested while protecting the confidentiality of their sources. Given that, why did police trample on the rights of Birney and McCaffrey? There may be some innocent explanation not yet proffered. Otherwise, choose from this list: embarrassment at the failure to arrest the killers named in the film; an attempt to prevent light being shone on the murky business of collusion between police and loyalist murderers; a diversionary tactic to avoid the implications of the message by demonising the messengers. Or, of course, a combination of the above. Why did the BBC\u2019s Thatcher series ignore the hunger strike? BBC Two\u2019s supposedly definitive five-part series on the \u201cirresistible rise and dramatic downfall of Margaret Thatcher\u201d has, in the main, been warmly received by critics. \u201cMagisterial\u201d, said the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Asa Bennett. \u201cOutstanding\u201d, trilled Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail. \u201cMarvellously told and truly historically insightful\u201d, wrote Euan Ferguson in the Observer. I was enjoying it, too, until I realised the makers of Thatcher: A Very British Revolution, passed 1981 without mentioning an episode that made headlines across the world: her intransigent response to the IRA hunger strike which ended with the deaths of 10 men. Surely everyone remembers the phrase with which she dismissed the men\u2019s demands to be granted political status: \u201cCrime is crime is crime. It is not political, it is crime.\u201d According to a BBC online article following her death in 2013, it was a defining moment. \u201cTo her supporters, it was exactly the kind of uncompromising stand on a matter of principle that made her great. To many in Ireland, it was a display of brutal inflexibility.\u201d So why the omission? When I asked the BBC, it gave this unconvincing reply: \u201cIn five hours of programming, the series aimed to capture as much as possible of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s career, her life and her relationship with her inner circle over the course of 20 years and, as such, difficult editorial decisions had to be made. Unfortunately, this meant that not every event that occurred during Thatcher\u2019s time in power could be included in the final series.\u201d Really? A statement by the BBC documentary unit\u2019s creative director, Aysha Rafaele, hints at a much more plausible reason. The series is, she said, \u201ca forensic look\u201d at Thatcher\u2019s \u201cimpact and legacy on all corners and all aspects of British life.\u201d Note the \u201cBritish\u201d. It suggests, yet again, that Northern Ireland is not regarded as truly British. Why does TV news use so many vox pops? I now find myself paraphrasing Brenda from Bristol\u2019s reaction to news of the 2017 election: \u201cYou\u2019re joking. Not another bloody vox pop. Oh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d Brenda is the only vox popper ever to make a memorable contribution to such an artless form of newsgathering. That\u2019s the problem, because reporters bearing microphones, cameras at their shoulder, now haunt the streets of Britain in the hope of finding another Brenda, another piece of comedy gold. After all, it\u2019s about entertaining viewers rather than informing them, is it not? Ivor Gaber, professor of political journalism at Sussex University and a former TV and radio news broadcaster, believes the overuse of vox pops has reached its apotheosis during the Brexit coverage, which has been skewed heavily towards those opposed to EU membership. He imagines the thought process of news editors: \u201cLet\u2019s do vox pops in a solid leaver area where we\u2019ll get people to say, \u2018Why don\u2019t they just get on with it\u2019. Much better than a remain area where they\u2019re likely to say, \u2018Well, on the one hand \u2026\u2019\u201d I can\u2019t be sure of the political slant because I haven\u2019t studied the output as closely as Gaber. But every time I see a vox pop about any subject, whether on the BBC, ITV or Sky, I know it is not going to reveal anything of any value. In a piece defending the practice, Mark Easton, the BBC\u2019s home affairs editor, argued that vox pops are \u201ca vital ingredient in trying to understand Britain\u201d. Sorry Mark, that just isn\u2019t so. If you want to be sure, why not go into the street and ask people if vox pops help them understand anything? But please don\u2019t broadcast the result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
