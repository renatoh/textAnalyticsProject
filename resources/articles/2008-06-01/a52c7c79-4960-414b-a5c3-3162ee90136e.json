When Jonathan signs up and leaves for the front, Beatrice is abandoned amid the desolate landscape of 'moorland, scrubby hills, grey, violet, black-brown', the 'brooding' waters of the reservoir and the hostile reserve of the Anglezarke women. When she's scrubbing carrots and knitting clothes for the soldiers, Beatrice dreams of clams, hot dogs, the noise of fairground rides on the shores of Coney Island and her former life as a minor celebrity and nude exhibit in a peep show: the Angel of Brooklyn. The relentless body count of young men in the First World War, and the deaths of both Beatrice and Jonathan's parents, is offset by the gentle romance between the couple and the black humour that enabled Beatrice and her brother, preacher-in-training Elijah, to survive a harrowing childhood with their father, a bloodthirsty amateur taxidermist. But it is Beatrice's demise that propels the novel forward from the very opening line: 'A week before they killed her, Beatrice told them about the dead birds.' What is it about this open, funny, brave woman that inspires such extremes of love and hate? And who will die first - she or Jonathan? Despite being mired in death, Janette Jenkins's third novel is lighthearted and confident, a bouncy, enjoyable read."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
