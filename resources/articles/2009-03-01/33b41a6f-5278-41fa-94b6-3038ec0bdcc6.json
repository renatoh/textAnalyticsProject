Cullen's move across rugby league's Cheshire gap will be confirmed when the Vikings kick off the Co-operative Championship season with a televised game at home to the French newcomers Toulouse Olympique on Thursday night. He has been working in the media since being sacked by Warrington last April and showed his pr savvy in his first comments as the new Widnes coach in a club press release, which quoted him as saying: \"The plan is simple, we need to get Widnes into Super League where we belong.\" Cullen should not have too many problems in winning around their supporters if he can deliver the results they need to ensure a successful application the next time Super League licences are available ahead of the 2012 season, and after such a sour end to his lengthy service to Warrington he will not be short of motivation to prove a point to the Wolves. Steve O'Connor, a haulage millionaire who rescued Widnes from administration and possible oblivion in late 2007, sacked Steve McCormack after a home defeat by Oldham in the first game of this season. \"We had 17 applications and it was pleasing to see that the name of Widnes is one that is still held in high regard within the rugby league world,\" he said. \"I have met with three of the applicants and during my meeting with Paul I was impressed with his enthusiasm and vision for the future of the club, one which I share with him.\" Cullen has signed a two-year contract and will be assisted by John Stankevitch, the former St Helens forward who has been in caretaker charge for the last month. Maurie Fa'asavalu, St Helens' Samoan-born England prop, has been summoned to appear at a disciplinary hearing for an alleged \"chicken wing\" tackle \u2013 one of the wrestling manoeuvres that have caused major controversy in Australia over the last 18 months, and which the British authorities are keen to prevent spreading into the Super League. Fa'asavalu could be banned for up to four matches if he is found guilty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
