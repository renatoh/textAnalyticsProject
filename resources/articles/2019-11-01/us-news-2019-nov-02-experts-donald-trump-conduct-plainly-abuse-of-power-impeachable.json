And even if it was bad \u2013 was it truly impeachable? As Democrats hit the gas on impeachment this week, Donald Trump exhorted Republicans to defend him on the substance of his actions in the Ukraine scandal, instead of sniping about the process. \u201cRupublicans [sic],\u201d Trump tweeted \u201cgo with Substance and close it out!\u201d Trump\u2019s misconduct, critics say, includes using the power of the presidency to solicit foreign intervention in the 2020 US election, by trying to force Ukraine to help conduct a political hit on Joe Biden. Trump denies all wrongdoing and most of his defenders do too. But there is a (slightly) subtler version of Trump defense that Republicans are trying out which says that while Trump\u2019s conduct has not been irreproachable, neither has it been impeachable. The argument, according to constitutional experts and historians of impeachment, is not a strong one. In fact, Trump\u2019s conduct, according to analysts interviewed by the Guardian, hews more closely than any previous conduct by any other president to what scholars conceive as a concrete example of impeachable behavior. Frank O Bowman III, author of High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump and a professor at the University of Missouri school of law, said that Trump\u2019s having extorted actions with no legitimate US national purpose from a foreign country that is \u201cliterally at risk of losing its political and territorial independence\u201d without US support was impeachable. \u201cIt\u2019s plainly an abuse of power, and it\u2019s plainly impeachable,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI think these are quite clearly, precisely the type of high crimes and misdemeanors that the founders not only feared but actually discussed at the constitutional convention,\u201d said Jeffrey A Engel, co-author of Impeachment: An American History and director of the center for presidential history at Southern Methodist University. \u201cThe high crime is the trade \u2013 give me dirt on Joe Biden and his son, and I\u2019ll give you in return military aid and help with your economy \u2013 I think that is certainly impeachable,\u201d said Corey Brettschneider, author of The Oath and the Office: A Guide to the Constitution for Future Presidents and a professor of constitutional law at Brown University. Many are finding defending Trump difficult at the moment. Republican lawmakers spent Thursday fleeing reporters trying to ask the question, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s OK for the president to pressure foreign governments to interfere in our elections?\u201d. One lawmaker even headbutted a camera rather than reply. The reason Trump\u2019s alleged conduct is plainly impeachable, historians say, has to do with US impeachment precedent and with what the authors of the US constitution meant when they provisioned impeachment for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d. \u201cIf we look at history both British and American \u2013 and it\u2019s important to look at British history, because our Framers were of course rebel Englishmen and they adopted the phrase \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019 in full recognition of the fact that that was a parliamentary term of art, and that therefore they were adopting to some degree, by reference, previous usages of that term \u2013 all of that leads to really the inescapable conclusion that one of the grounds for impeachment has always been abuse of power,\u201d said Bowman. While Trump and his defenders reject the allegation that he has any divided loyalties, critics have pointed out that his actions in office, including his withholding of military aid from Ukraine, have advanced Russian interests \u2013 and his own personal interests, when it comes to soliciting election assistance. The founders drafted the impeachment clause specifically with problematic foreign loyalties in mind, Engel said. \u201cHaving just gone through the process of a divisive revolution, where it was literally neighbor against neighbor and sometimes even brother against brother split over loyalty,\u201d Engel said, \u201cthere was a great deal of concern about just simply making sure that the people who were in charge generally had America\u2019s best interests at heart. Because people had so many friends over the course of their lives that did not \u2013 or at least that chose France or that chose Britain.\u201d In an Oval Office interview on Thursday, Trump compared his conduct favorably with the last two presidents to face impeachment proceedings, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. \u201cEverybody knows I did nothing wrong,\u201d Trump told the Washington Examiner. \u201cBill Clinton did things wrong; Richard Nixon did things wrong. I won\u2019t go back to [Andrew] Johnson because that was a little before my time. But they did things wrong. I did nothing wrong.\u201d Trump\u2019s analysis of his own behavior does not stand up to scrutiny, scholars said. \u201cObviously the degree of severity is almost immeasurably different,\u201d said Bowman. \u201cWith respect to Clinton, yes you had a violation of law, in the sense of his having committed perjury, but he committed perjury in order to conceal a private, consensual sexual affair. Now that\u2019s discreditable, it\u2019s also criminal \u2013 he got disbarred as a result of doing it. \u201cBut in terms of the interests of the nation, not even remotely comparable. \u201cIn this case, Trump is literally holding the independence of another country hostage to his own political interests. Not only is that contemptible, and in many ways more contemptible than what Nixon did, but I think it\u2019s also true, and we\u2019ve heard a lot of testimony about this over the past couple of weeks, that what he was doing is endangering an American policy objective, the whole framework of containment of Russian expansionism, the bedrock of our policy in eastern Europe for the last 70 years. \u201cIt\u2019s far worse, in that regard, I think, than what Nixon did.\u201d Engel said the \u201cNixon case is very instructive\u201d in judging the integrity of Trump\u2019s defensive wall in the Republican members of Congress. \u201cThe Republicans by and large backed Nixon right up until the moment they didn\u2019t,\u201d Engel said. \u201cWhich is to say, when new information came out, in his case specifically the smoking gun tape, that nobody in good conscience could refute, his support eroded literally overnight. \u201cAnd I think we will see potentially a similar dynamic, at least that dynamic is set up, that there\u2019s no particular reason at this moment that Republicans feel a need to break with their party. \u201cBut history suggests that they may at some point open the newspaper and realize they have no choice but to switch sides.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
