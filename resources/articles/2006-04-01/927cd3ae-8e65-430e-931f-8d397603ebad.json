Had they drawn up a fantasy CV for the ideal candidate to lead the corporation's youth-focused digital channel, they would have struggled to beat that of Julian Bellamy's. Public service credentials? Check. The crop-haired 35-year-old worked on Dispatches and World in Action before becoming editor of current affairs at Channel 4. More recently as head of factual entertainment he helped develop Channel 4's signature mix of entertainment and real life with the likes of Brat Camp and The Unteachables. The populist touch? Tick. Since 2001 he has looked after Big Brother and Celebrity Big Brother, overseeing the programme's transition from one-off phenomenon to annual multiplatform summer ratings banker. Multichannel experience? That too. In 2005 he added E4 to his responsibilities as it went free-to-air and enjoyed a massive budget boost as part of a strategy to reprioritise C4's spin-off channels. Still in the process of moving in to one of the glass boxes inhabited by BBC channel controllers, he is aware that his new job will be a challenge of a different order: \"I had six years at Channel 4 and they were amazing years. But the opportunity to work at BBC3 just felt new, different and irresistible. I couldn't pass it up.\" Former colleagues sing his praises as someone who intuitively understands modern television and its relationship with audiences. Not that you would know it to meet him. In person Bellamy is unassuming and vaguely shambolic. In contrast to Murphy's boundless enthusiasm, he is more thoughtful and rambling. With the TV Centre revolving doors working overtime in the past 18 months, Bellamy's appointment also highlights the increased permeability of the wall between the BBC and the commercial world. At a time when most of the traffic appeared to be the other way, Bellamy was a highly prized catch. \"The first time I walked inside this building in my life was a couple of days after being offered the job. I got lost. One of the big things you feel is the size of this place. It's enormous. You walk through your office and there's a WH Smith in there. And a hairdressers. I still need to be escorted to the canteen,\" he laughs. \"But to be honest there are more similarities than differences. In the end, we're all sitting around with creative people, scratching our heads and looking for an idea.\" Yet it is equally clear that he is relishing the increased freedom BBC3's huge \u00a393m-a-year budget, all of it to be invested in home-grown commissions, will bring: \"E4 and BBC3 are different in many ways. It's great to be in a place that is absolutely dedicated to developing and nurturing new talent, that has new comedy at the core of what it does.\" Bellamy is not one to hang around. While full of praise for Murphy and insistent that his mantra will be \"evolution not revolution\", he goes on to list \"two or three things\" that actually sound like a manifesto for some big changes. As you would perhaps expect from one of those behind Big Brother, a show that tapped into and reflected the attitudes of a generation, he wants everything the channel does to be \"even more single-minded about appealing to our target audience\" of 25-to-34 year-olds. He \"couldn't disagree more\" with the view expressed by economist Patrick Barwise, in his independent review of the channel, that a narrow age range acted as a creative straitjacket. \"In a world of proliferation of choice, the channels who know what they stand for and know who they're targeting will be the ones that really flourish. We must be pretty single-minded about it. BBC3 should feel increasingly like a young entertainment channel,\" he says. \"That doesn't mean narrowing range or going light on content. I mean that primarily as a mindset, the values that you infuse across all genres,\" he adds. Bellamy points to Shameless, surely the programme most referenced and coveted by television executives, as \"a really good example of how you can take on tough subjects but come to the viewer with a wonderful piece of entertainment\". Mindful of the difficulty of establishing a new digital channel, even one with a \u00a393m budget, Murphy tended to concentrate on one genre, or even one theme, at a time. While this strategy was broadly successful, producing some big stand-out hits (Little Britain), some hugely acclaimed drama (Bodies and Casanova) and some talked about one-offs (Flashmob), it tended to give the schedule a rather uneven feel. And it was sometimes difficult to equate the glittering awards cabinet and BBC PR rhetoric with a schedule that could, caught on a bad day, include a Little Britain repeat, an EastEnders catch-up and a couple of episodes of the long-running sitcom Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps, a show which even the BBC's own website calls \"shockingly bad\". While highlighting the importance of developing new ways of delivering programmes to BBC3 viewers at the forefront of experiments with on-demand internet viewing and so on, he is a big believer in channel brands and will seek to inject a more live, contemporary feel. \"It should not feel like it exists only on tape,\" he says. To that end, one priority will be an unscripted entertainment show. Since the early disappointment of Johnny Vaughan's nightly chatshow flop, BBC3 has broadly steered clear of regular live programming. \"They're notoriously hard to get right. But what those shows can do for you is have quite a big impact on the perception of a channel. It could be a panel show, it could be a gameshow with the inventiveness of Shooting Stars, it could be an entertainment event,\" says Bellamy, going on to rattle through his ideas as he gains momentum, ticking off the new commissions on his fingers as he goes. In comedy - the most high-profile success story so far for the channel with series ranging from Little Britain to The Mighty Boosh - he thinks it is time to up the ante further. \"I think it's precisely because BBC3 has been so successful with comedy that it has broad enough shoulders to show more comedy of wider, popular appeal without compromising that inventive, distinctive DNA,\" he says. Upcoming offerings include Little Miss Jocelyn, a \"loud, fun, silly sketch show\" by Jocelyn Gee of Three Non Blondes, and Pulling, described as \"Sex and the City with kebabs\". Alongside such populist fare, Bellamy says the channel should \"also be the place for existing talent to do something new and daring.\" To that end, Rob Brydon is filming Annually Retentive, \"a twisted British Larry Sanders\". The comic stars as the disillusioned host of a history quiz show, with the likes of David Mitchell and Jimmy Carr. Another focus is boosting the audience's pre-watershed share with a series of pilot comedies, plus Burglars, a \"comedy farce about two hapless lovable rogues\". He is particularly looking forward to Sinchronicity, a drama based around the misadventures of a group of 20somethings in Manchester, from the team behind C4 teen hits Sugar Rush and As If, and adult Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood. In a move that could either be viewed as a cynical attempt to ghettoise it or a laudable effort to champion it, BBC3's commitment to current affairs will be concentrated into four or five week-long seasons, each focusing on a different theme. The first, this summer, will feature a series of documentaries on body image. Similarly in music and arts, Dreamscape and two or three part series will make way for a concentration on more broad appeal, one-off music events, from the bold (Good Friday's Manchester Passion) to the rather less bold (blanket coverage of Reading and Leeds festivals). In an ever more competitive environment the aim, as ever, will be to \"punch through\" with \"more ruthless marketing\" and more event programming. \"The art of running these things is that it's a kind of a brew, to which you're constantly adding and taking away,\" says Bellamy, refusing to countenance canning the 10pm EastEnders repeat and insisting that spin-offs from BBC1 will still play a part \"where appropriate\". But he acknowledges that he will have to be brave in axeing popular shows to make way for new ones and waving off successful programmes to BBC1 or BBC2. \"It's the thing you agonise over and torture yourself about. It's one of the phenomena of modern popular television that formats burn very quickly and very brightly. But my sense is to go with your gut instinct,\" says Bellamy. He wants BBC3 to continue to be the \"maverick, subversive, guerrilla wing\" of the corporation while, at the same time broadening its appeal. \"Ultimately, you're judged by hits,\" he concedes. \"I'm here because I want to make telly that touches people's lives. It sounds cheesy but it's true. Television that makes people laugh, lifts their spirits, moves them.\" Curriculum Vitae Age 35 Education Ashlyns Comprehensive, Berkhamsted; Cambridge University; Sussex University Career 1998 Deputy editor, Dispatches 1998 Editor, current affairs, Channel 4 2001 Commissioning editor, Big Brother and commissioning editor, factual in the nations and regions 2003 Head of factual entertainment, Channel 4 2005 Head of factual entertainment and head of E4 Jan 2006 Controller, BBC3"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
