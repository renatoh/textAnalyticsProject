Promising to bring to the country the same blend of fiscal austerity and conservative social policies that have made him a deeply divisive figure in his home state, Walker said the US had fallen into a culture of dependency at home and cowed leadership abroad, but said: \u201cThe good news is that there is still time left to turn things around.\u201d \u201cIf our reforms can work in a blue state like Wisconsin, they can work anywhere in America,\u201d Walker said. Making a comparatively late entry to a field that already contains 14 other Republican candidates eager to cut taxes, stop voter fraud, liberalize gun laws and strengthen border security, Walker faces an early challenge to distinguish himself from the pack. Polling in the early voting state of Iowa, however, suggests that some of the work of achieving a national profile has already been achieved, thanks to Walker\u2019s winner-take-all fight with public-sector unions in Wisconsin in 2011, the year he assumed office. Survey averages have for months shown Walker in first place among Republicans in Iowa, and he currently polls at 19 points to 10 for runner-up Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor. Walker won the fight, stripping unions\u2019 collective bargaining rights and docking take-home pay in a budget-cutting spree estimated to have saved the state $3bn over three years. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been governor, we took on the unions and won,\u201d the candidate said on Monday, to cheers. Supporters at the event said they had come to urge Walker to seek a larger stage for his achievements. \u201cI\u2019ll be sad for Wisconsin if he does make it,\u201d one supporter, Lisa Bishop, who attended the event with her husband Jeff, told the Guardian. The event drew out-of-state supporters too. James Bragg, a Dallas native who spends summers in Wisconsin, was selling buttons that said \u201cWalker for president\u201d, \u201cUnited we stand\u201d and \u201cBenghazi matters\u201d. Asked why he was mobilizing for Walker, Bragg said \u201cthere\u2019s no work to do in Texas\u201d, which has a Republican governor, a GOP-majority legislature and two current or former statewide officeholders running for president in 2016. On the stage, Walker gave a national audience a taste of what to expect on the campaign trail. While he can seem methodical in his remarks, he showed flashes of the true-believer animation that has won him such broad support in the conservative establishment, from the grass roots to major donors like the Koch brothers. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been governor, we passed lawsuit reform and regulatory reform,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We passed castle doctrine and concealed carry. And we now require a photo ID to vote in the state of Wisconsin.\u201d He also called for the repeal of Obamacare. Studies have suggested that many Wisconsin residents have not fared well under Walker. In the three years after a climactic showdown at the state capitol drew tens of thousands of protesters and prompted Democratic legislators to flee the state in an effort to deny a quorum, public-sector employees such as nurses, teachers, snow-plow drivers and social workers saw their paychecks shrink an estimated 8%-10%, on median salaries of about $44,000. Walker\u2019s fight against public-sector unions has since expanded to the private sector, with a \u201cright-to-work\u201d law that banned workplace agreements requiring employees to pay compulsory union dues. Walker\u2019s belief that public employees had been overcompensated also grew to encompass an attack on a 100-year-old living wage law in Wisconsin; efforts to secure paid leave for employees; and efforts to raise the minimum wage from the federally mandated $7.25 per hour. \u201cWe understand that true freedom and prosperity don\u2019t come from the mighty hand of the government, they come from empowering people to live their own lives and control their own destinies through the dignity that comes from work,\u201d Walker said at his rally. The governor also touted laws requiring drug screenings for welfare recipients and other assertive social policies. \u201cIn Wisconsin, we enacted a program that says that adults who are able to work must be enrolled in one of our job training programs before they can get a welfare check,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, as of the budget I just signed, we are also making sure they can take a drug test. \u201cWhen I proposed this, the status quo defenders cried that we were making it harder to get government assistance. My response? No, we\u2019re making it easier to get a job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
