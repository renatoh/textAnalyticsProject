It found that the proportion of women who binge drink rose from 8% in 1998 to 15% in 2006. Over the same period, binge drinking among men increased only slightly, from 22% to 23%. Binge drinking is defined as consuming on at least one day a week more than twice the safe limit recommended by the government, which is three to four units of alcohol for a man and two to three units for a woman. Royal colleges representing the physicians and nurses who deal with the medical consequences of drinking to excess said last month the government's public health campaigns were not working. They backed a proposal from Sir Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, for a minimum price per unit of alcohol to prevent supermarkets from fuelling a culture of heavy consumption by offering strong drinks at discount prices. But the prime minister dismissed the idea, saying that the sensible majority of moderate drinkers should not have to pay for the excesses of the few. The JRF report said the narrowing of the alcohol gender gap could be partly explained by a tendency among many women to prefer wine to beer. The method adopted by the government for calculating a unit of alcohol changed in 2006, in effect doubling the number of units in a glass of wine. Researchers adjusted the data before 2006 to create a consistent set of statistics. The foundation also identified the influence of advertising and women's increased independence and financial security as reasons for an increase in binge drinking. Across Britain, they found the average consumption of women aged 16 to 24 rose from 7.3 units a week in 1992 to 10.8 in 2006. The biggest increase in consumption was among women over 65, rising from 2.7 units to 5.1 a week. They were surprised to find that young adults of both sexes are drinking less, a trend particularly pronounced among young men. The number of males aged 16 to 24 who indulge in binge drinking fell from 39% in 1998 to 30% in 2006. Fewer children are drinking, but those who do are consuming more than ever. The report said: \"The amount of alcohol consumed by adolescents aged 11 to 13 increased substantially between 1992 and 2006 in England.\" Heavier drinking among young adults might be explained by advertising, easy availability of cheap alcohol and greater disposable income, but these factors could not account for the core of younger teenagers and children who are drinking more. \"The most compelling consideration when trying to explain the rising trend in consumption among 11- to 13-year-olds is the influence of parents, family, friends and the home environment.\" Lead author Lesley Smith, from Oxford Brookes University, said an examination of trends over the last 15 to 20 years indicated it was generally the behaviour of women that has changed, at least in the UK. She added: \"Many people will be surprised to learn that young men's drinking, including binge drinking, has gone down in recent years, while middle-aged and older people's drinking has increased.\" A Sheffield University study commissioned by the Department of Health said last year that targeting price increases at cheaper types of alcohol served in bars and pubs would deter excessive consumption without unduly penalising moderate drinkers. Last June the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Home Office and the DoH announced plans to work with the alcohol industry to develop a mandatory alcohol retailing code. Results of a consultation on the proposals are due shortly. Chris Sorek, chief executive of Drinkaware, a charity funded by the drinks industry to help people make informed decisions about alcohol, said: \"Even in small amounts, alcohol affects women differently to men \u2013 studies suggest women are more prone to liver disease after a comparatively shorter period of heavy drinking. Alcohol can also affect women's chances of conceiving a child and can lead to an increased risk of breast cancer.\" A DoH spokesman said: \"In the past year, we have announced a package of measures to tackle excessive drinking and reduce alcohol health harm. For those young people who do develop problems, there are record numbers of treatment places available.\" Britain did not suddenly hit the bottle in 2006, as the official figures suggest. What happened was that government statisticians decided that the tried and tested way of measuring how much alcohol we consume did not adequately reflect the increasing strength of wine, beer and lager. Many pubs and restaurants were also serving wine in larger glasses. The new system in effect doubled the assumed unit strength of wine. A standard 175ml glass of white wine is now worth two units. Two small 125ml glasses are worth three \u2013 the upper maximum for a woman wanting to avoid binge drinking. A YouGov poll last year found 77% of adults did not know how many units there were in a glass of wine. John Carvel"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
