Because the festival season is about to get underway, from Festimad (June 9-10) to Las Noches M\u00e1gicas (July 15-29) featuring Bj\u00f6rk. Probably the best is Summercase (July 13-14), touted as the urban Benicassim and taking place simultaneously in the capital and Barcelona. Bands include Bloc Party, Arcade Fire and the Kaiser Chiefs (tickets from \u20ac105, summercase.com). Getting there BA (ba.com) from Gatwick and Heathrow; easyJet (easyjet.com) from Bristol, Edinburgh, Gatwick, Liverpool and Luton. Where to stay On the chic at boutique chain Room Mate (four hotels, doubles from \u20ac80, room-matehoteles.com). Where to eat Burgers are the festival staple, so try an El Bulli burger from chef-guru Ferran Adri\u00e1's Fast Good chain, (fast-good.com), which has two outlets in the city."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
