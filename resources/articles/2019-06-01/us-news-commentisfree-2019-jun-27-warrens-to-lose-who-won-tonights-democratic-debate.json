Shameful Generously speaking, Democratic presidential candidates tonight spent a little less than 10 minutes after nearly an hour and a half had gone by answering a handful of direct questions about a climate crisis that could make large swathes of the planet horrifically uninhabitable by the end of this century. (NBC\u2019s technical difficulties took nearly as long.) The best you can say is that tonight\u2019s climate bit was still longer than the time spent on climate during the entirety of the 2016 debates. NBC should be ashamed of itself. So should Democratic national chairman Tom Perez. Members of the Sunrise Movement \u2013 which pushed the idea of the Green New Deal into the national spotlight late last year \u2013 are sitting in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington DC, pushing the DNC to organize a debate dedicated solely to the potential end of human civilization. As tonight proved, it\u2019s desperately needed. Kate Aronoff is a writing fellow at In These Times. She covers elections and the politics of climate change Lloyd Green: Booker stole Warren\u2019s thunder Cory Booker won Wednesday\u2019s debate and \u2013 for one night, anyway \u2013 stole Elizabeth Warren\u2019s thunder. Booker scored the most TV time, close to 11 minutes, and the New Jersey senator sounded progressive but not extreme. Substantively, Booker made a difference in the discourse. He refused to buy into Medicare for All, and acknowledged the \u201cneed to check corporate consolidation\u201d without sounding as if his candidacy was an anti-business crusade. In the end, Booker was simultaneously assertive and reassuring. His closing had both heft and lift, the latter being something badly needed but in short supply this election cycle. An attorney in New York, Lloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992 Malaika Jabali: Warren framed herself as a fighter Tonight\u2019s debate was Elizabeth Warren\u2019s to lose, and she remained a winner. Warren shone particularly in the first half, where she set a populist tone, arguing that it was corrupt for America to have an economy that was great for \u201cthose with money\u201d but not for everyone else. She also framed herself as a fighter who would go after big corporations, buttressing her positions with passion. Besides her tone, Warren argued for structural change \u2013 calling healthcare a basic human right, supporting Medicare for All, and highlighting the prison-industrial complex that disproportionately incarcerates blacks and Latinos. Malaika Jabali is a public policy attorney, writer, and activist whose writing has appeared in Essence, Jacobin, the Intercept, Glamour and elsewhere Theodore R Johnson: Tonight\u2019s breakout star? Juli\u00e1n Castro Coming into the first Democratic primary debate, Juli\u00e1n Castro was polling at just 1%, and 56% of voters hadn\u2019t heard or held no opinion of him. That will change after tonight. No other contender on stage did as much for their candidacy as Castro. He showed compassion and concern on racial justice issues, deep knowledge of immigration law, and a fighting spirit as he called attention to policy differences between him and others, especially fellow Texan Beto O\u2019Rourke. This early in the party primary, name recognition matters. In this regard, Castro helped his cause substantially. It remains to be seen if his debate win translates into more fundraising and electoral support for Castro, but there\u2019s little doubt that after tonight more Americans know who he is. That\u2019s the best outcome he could\u2019ve hoped for. Theodore R Johnson is a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice Arwa Mahdawi: The media has been focused on the wrong Texan Whether it\u2019s healthcare, gun control or dealing with Mitch McConnell, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s got a plan for it. She reminded us of her policy chops again tonight in a way that was assertive, genuine and immensely presidential. Of course, this debate was always Warren\u2019s to lose \u2013 and while she was the most impressive candidate, Juli\u00e1n Castro may actually have \u201cwon\u201d the night. He dominated the section on immigration and springboarded himself into the limelight. Castro has been overlooked for some time; after tonight, people will be paying attention. As his takedown of the lackluster Beto O\u2019Rourke over immigration reform demonstrated, the media has focused far too much on the wrong Texan. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist Alexandria Villase\u00f1or: A pleasing personality won\u2019t save this planet I was really disappointed in the first night of the Democratic debate. The climate crisis was not sufficiently discussed and NBC didn\u2019t give everyone an equal chance to speak. I\u2019m a climate activist because it is the biggest issue humanity is facing. Climate change is part of every issue they talked about, including healthcare, immigration and the presidency of Donald Trump. Climate change is an existential threat and the future of my generation, and our entire civilization is at stake. With these debates, we need to stop focusing on who\u2019s popular, or who has the best one-liner, or who people \u201clike\u201d. A pleasing personality won\u2019t save this planet.
