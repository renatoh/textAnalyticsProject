After all, they weren't playing in the main venue, but in the Floral Hall, a beautiful structure with the acoustic subtlety of a glass box. And though the hall was sold out, it still looked as if several hundred more fans should have been allowed in. And yet, despite the difficult acoustics, they managed to show how much they have improved over the past two years. When Bellowhead started out it was more an amusing indulgence for singer and fiddler Jon Boden and concertina and accordion player John Spiers, who had surrounded themselves with everything from sousaphone to cello and pipes, in a project designed to present ballads, sea shanties and traditional dance tunes in a new setting. It did not quite work, because Boden was over-theatrical and the brass was a mess. But all that has changed. Boden has calmed down, the musicianship has radically improved, and the new-look Bellowhead are now a rousing instrumental dance band who can switch from party mode to some real surprises. The traditional tunes and reels may have been the favourites, but what makes the band so special is their invention in other areas, from the sturdy treatment of the traditional sailors' ballad Across the Line, now mixed with Brazilian influences inspired by Milton Nascimento, through to the stirring five-part harmonies, concertina and delicate brass work on the old Copper Family song from Sussex, One May Morning Early. A band this fine deserved a proper concert hall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
