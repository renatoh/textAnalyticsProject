As to whether I intend to stand again for mayor, I proposed to Tony Blair - originally in a letter in the Guardian in January 1998 - that I would stand for one term with Trevor Phillips as my deputy, if I could stand as Labour's candidate. Once it became apparent Labour was not interested in this proposal, I made it clear that I would stand for mayor of London until I was hobbling into work on my zimmer frame. Ken Livingstone MP Mayor of London \u0095 Good to hear Tony Blair admit in his Bristol speech that Labour must make itself different from the Tory party. What better way to do this than to drop the obsession with privatisation and let London Underground and the national air traffic control service stay in public hands?
