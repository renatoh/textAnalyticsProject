No fewer than five centre-backs have been included in the squad he will take to Japan. Admittedly one of these, Manchester United's Wes Brown, is in as an option at right-back after the loss of Gary Neville with a broken metatarsal bone. Even so Eriksson is clearly putting considerable faith in the wooden walls of old England. The inclusion of the 35-year-old Martin Keown, a well weathered piece of oak from the middle of Arsenal's back four, is the one mild surprise in the party of 23 Eriksson announced yesterday. Keown joins Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand and Gareth Southgate in a centre-back pool from which England will hope to draw sufficient defensive strength to blunt the attacks of Sweden, Argentina and Nigeria in the most demanding of the first-round groups. But for breaking a leg at Blackburn in January, an injury which put him out of action for six weeks, Keown might have been closer to selection rather earlier. As it is he has played himself into the squad on the strength of some outstanding games during Arsenal's final push for the Premiership and FA Cup Double, with Wednesday's performance at Old Trafford not least among them. \"I don't remember when I first saw Keown play,\" Eriksson said yesterday. \"Perhaps I was managing Benfica. But I do remember that he was always standing there, always chasing centre-forwards, always doing his job. You look at the Keown of 10 years ago and the Keown who played yesterday and you don't see a lot of difference.\" Keown will appear in England's opening match against Sweden in Saitama only if Eriksson alters his thoughts about the present centre-back partnership of Ferdinand and Campbell, which looked vulnerable both in Germany before England won 5-1 and against Albania at St James' Park four days later. Nevertheless the Arsenal defender's experience will go some way towards compensating for the loss of Gary Neville. Tournament experience is what is lacking in this predominantly youthful squad, 12 of whom are aged 24 or under. Eriksson wants such senior players as Keown, David Seaman, Teddy Sheringham and Gareth Southgate to be father figures. \"You hope they will be leaders,\" he said yesterday, \"and not only on the pitch.\" Just where an England team led by Father Ted ends up remains to be seen. Not that Eriksson has gone for youth for its own sake. \"I haven't picked people because they are young,\" he insisted. \"They are there because they are good enough to be there. And players like David Beckham, Michael Owen and Paul Scholes have a lot of experience in international football.\" Beckham's participation in the World Cup still depends on his broken metatarsal mending in time. Liverpool's Danny Murphy has been put on standby in case the England captain or Nicky Butt, nursing damaged knee ligaments, does not make it. Murphy will not travel with the squad to Dubai on Monday for their pre-tournament break but will stay in training. \"His choice, my choice,\" said Eriksson. Murphy would probably be in the squad now but for Eriksson's decision to take Keown as an extra centre-back, a choice dictated by the coach's desire to have a cover for every position. Yet this has left the midfield relying heavily on Beckham and Butt getting fit and the injury-prone Steven Gerrard and Kieron Dyer staying fit. The longer England stay in the tournament the more valuable the versatility of Owen Hargreaves, with his ability to play in defence or midfield, and Joe Cole, a natural rover, may become. Hargreaves is a possibility for the vacant right-back position although Brown and Danny Mills are also strong contenders. The strikers virtually picked themselves and Eriksson was never likely to pick more than five, which ruled out Blackburn's Matt Jansen. Owen and Emile Heskey are the first choices with Sheringham the man to come off the bench, as he did against Greece. This England squad will arouse the curiosity of the rest of the World Cup without sending many shivers down spines. It reflects the genuine promise of the coming generation of English footballers but also the limitations of choice imposed by the proliferation of foreign imports. Most of Eriksson's predecessors left out players of a quality which would have made them automatic selections this time. Yet none of those omitted by Eriksson could claim to have an unanswerable case for inclusion. The international career of Steve McManaman is almost certainly over, signed off with a message from Eriksson on the player's answerphone. That of Darren Anderton too, and when Andy Cole greeted the squad's release by promptly announcing his retirement from international football it meant only that he was the last to know his time with England had long since been up. Eriksson and his assistant Tord Grip did not finalise the squad until 9.30 yesterday morning - the handwritten original later fetched \u00a35,000 at a charity auction. \"I am confident we are going to have a good World Cup,\" the England coach said. \"If we can survive the first three games then anything is possible.\" In fact it almost comes down to how Eriksson approaches the opening match against Sweden, his home country. His squad gives England a good chance of avoiding defeat without suggesting many ways in which they will break down an eight-man defence. Joe Cole is Eriksson's wild card, Sheringham a trump if played at the right moment. Little Joe and Father Ted, together they may yet throw all those centre-backs into a more positive light. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
