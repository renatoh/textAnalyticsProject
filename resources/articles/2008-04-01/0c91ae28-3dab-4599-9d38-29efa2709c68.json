Today it is heard mostly in bits, perhaps because the piece is about as pastoral as they come, and it is harder now to care much about nymphs and shepherds frolicking in pastures green. Yet in this new production by Transition, the simple tale of nymph meets shepherd, jealous Cyclops kills shepherd, nymph transforms shepherd into stream, comes over as bold and lively, contemporary and profoundly moving. Not to mention funny. I haven't laughed at an opera this much in years. I laughed at a boy scout Acis, who pedals a rusty Chopper through Wilton's Music Hall, singing (with immense poise given the circumstances): \"Where shall I seek the charming fair?\"; at Galatea, whose 1950s chic distracts the gormless Acis from the charms of three Jean-Paul Gaultieresque sailor boys by uncovering teasing stretches of suntanned leg. With an intimate set ingeniously enhanced by video projections, some of them live, this was a rare production in which all the gimmickry was tied cleanly to framing the emotional core of the drama. Musically, the star of a high-quality show was Nicholas Watts as Acis; his evenly tempered, richly characterful tenor was quite extraordinary. The ensemble singing, too, was mostly exquisite, Handel's delicate five-part voicing amply grounded by Jonathan Brown's rich bass. In terms of acting, it would be odd indeed were the operatic limelight stolen by a non-singing role. But such was the skill of Alvaro Flores Mejorada - as a non-speaking sailor - that this might well have been, were it not for Sin\u00e9ad Campbell's Galatea. Though vocally not flawless, Campbell proved a compelling, seductive central presence, much aided by the breezy, unsentimental direction of Christian Curnyn and his small, crack ensemble of period instrument players. \u00b7 Ends tonight.
