Yesterday, however, his team manager Johan Bruyneel said that the demands made on the Texan last year had set him back in his campaign to stretch the record to seven wins in a row this July. \"Last year, after his sixth win, the winter was crazy,\" said Bruyneel, speaking after Armstrong had pulled out of his first race of the season, the 750-mile Paris-Nice \"race to the sun\". \"His slow start [this year] is principally due to the number of things he has been asked to do.\" Armstrong had already hinted that he was behind in his preparation because this winter he had spent longer than usual in the United States, where there are more distractions to prevent him from riding his bike. \"When I am there I have difficulty reconciling the demands of my preparation and the things I have to do outside cycling,\" he said. In Wednesday's third stage he felt ill and that night he flew back to his Spanish base in Gerona by private jet. \"If a rider doesn't feel well and has feverish sensations he doesn't want to race,\" said Bruyneel yesterday. \"I was the first one to tell him that the best thing was to pack his bags and go back to Gerona.\" It was not clear when Armstrong would be back on his bike either in training or racing because, according to Bruyneel, he has a virus which worsened during Wednesday night. \"It is not the sort of thing you get rid of in two days,\" said Bruyneel. \"We will have to see when he gets back on his bike.\" The manager added that the snowy weather of this year's Paris-Nice had made the race tougher than usual and had probably contributed to Armstrong's illness. Though Bruyneel said the illness was \"not a big problem\" it is a setback because Armstrong will have to try to make up the racing miles he has missed by riding in other events. He has steered clear of Paris-Nice in the six years he has won the Tour, on the ground that it is too tough for a rider aiming to peak in July, and this outcome suggests he was probably right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
