There were, he insisted, sound tactical reasons for the elevation of Christo Bezuidenhout but the consequence is that only one non-white player, Ashwin Willemse, will feature in South Africa's starting XV. Never mind that Sephaka had a bad day propping opposite Uruguay's Pablo Lemoine last weekend for, in South African sport, nothing is ever that simple. In the Super 12, South African teams must have two non-white players in the starting line-up and two on the bench. At Test level, there is an understanding that management should attempt to select at least three non-white players in the 22 and two in the starting team. For the biggest game of his tenure, however, Straeuli has been unable to deliver. The 33-year-old Bezuidenhout, born in the Canary Islands, where his father was employed laying cables, has never started a Test. The team manager Gideon Sam, a former anti-apartheid activist, was at pains, nevertheless, to deflect any criticism from back home in the Republic. \"Maybe if we can explain to them this change is for tactical reasons they will be understanding,\" Sam said, acknowledging the pre-tournament injury to Gcobani Bobo had complicated the issue by reducing the number of non-white players in the Springbok squad from six to five. \"We brought out 30 players to make an assault on the trophy, not just a couple. \"There is no doubt in my mind this team are united. I'm convinced they are. If someone can prove otherwise, then we will look at it.\" With Bezeidenhout's elevation the Pretoria-based Blue Bulls will supply the entire front five. The captain Corne Krige is back after missing the 72-6 defeat of Uruguay, with Jorrie Muller at centre in place of the injured Jaque Fourie and Jaco van der Westhuyzen at full-back in preference to Werner Greeff. There are only three survivors - Krige, Greef and Joost van der Westhuizen - from the 22-man Springbok squad thrashed at Twickenham last November and the South Africans are adamant there will be no repeat of the violence that overshadowed their 53-3 defeat. \"I would say it was a watershed because it taught us to work on our discipline,\" said Van der Westhuizen. \"Test matches are about discipline, about passion and about how much a team wants it.\" England, meanwhile, have confirmed the fitness of their scrum-halves Kyran Bracken and Matt Dawson. Bath's scrum-half Martyn Wood, having spent 60 hours in Australia as precautionary cover, is due back home this morning. Clive Woodward, England's coach, said: \"We've played South Africa nine times since I've been in charge and apart from probably one game for each side, it's always been close. They give their all every time you play them and I am expecting a massive battle.\" England received a vote of no confidence yesterday from Claude Saurel, the Georgia coach whose side were beaten 84-6 by Woodward's team on Sunday. \"I think they are so much under stress that they are going to be scared stiff before every game and I don't think you would be able to get a smile from Clive Woodward even if you bought him a bag of tickles.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
