We\u2019ve been together now for four years and everything else is ingrained in us now, so it\u2019s just really down to winning and I think that\u2019s the mentality within the whole squad. In the past, Man United was the kind of game where maybe we wouldn\u2019t have seen it out, or we might have suffered more in the first half. But we went there and we got the job done.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s encounter with Watford on Sunday will pit two of the Premier League\u2019s flawless starters against each other. The Hornets\u2019 strong start to the season has caught many by surprise, but Spurs have also exceeded expectations, not least with their comprehensive victory at Old Trafford on Monday. After a summer of no signings and delays to the new White Hart Lane (a further twist to which came this week with Spurs attempting to move an Carabao Cup tie to Milton Keynes much to the chagrin of their opponents, Watford), turbulence was predicted for Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team. But they have confounded those expectations. \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken a lot about how we\u2019ve started slowly in the past three seasons and how that\u2019s hindered us a bit,\u201d Dier says. \u201cFrom there, you\u2019re constantly playing catch-up. We really wanted to change that this season and so far we have. But it\u2019s still so early, we\u2019ve played three games. We now have another really tough game and we want to win it.\u201d The words \u201ctough\u201d and \u201csuffering\u201d crop up a lot when Dier, leaning back in his chair at Spurs\u2019 refurbished training complex, lays out his view of where the club is at. He jokes that \u201csuffering is good!\u201d when it comes to overcoming difficulties on the pitch. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through difficult periods in the past three seasons, and we\u2019re going to go through difficult periods this season, too,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to suffer but we have to know how to get through that, and I think we do.\u201d As for off-field hassles, however, Dier is inclined to give them short shrift. Like his manager, the midfielder has no time for the idea that this summer\u2019s lack of recruitment was somehow a failure. \u201cI always see now, when big teams are doing badly, people say they need to spend another \u00a3200m or \u00a3300m. I just think it\u2019s crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are looking at the wrong things if they think they need to spend money to change things. For me, people use it as an excuse. \u201cIt\u2019s just my personal opinion, but I think we are a good example because we have had to find different ways to achieve the same results as other teams. I think in the long run we will be in a better position for it. People love to talk about the fact we have not signed anyone but we have got a fantastic squad. First of all, why sign someone if they are not going to improve that? And secondly, we have got a fantastic atmosphere \u2013 we work extremely hard and the manager has instilled that culture in the club, every player has it. If they don\u2019t, they won\u2019t be welcome here. That\u2019s more important than any amount of money you can spend.\u201d Often giving the impression of being his manager\u2019s avatar on the pitch, all gritted teeth and clear-eyed thinking, Dier was forced to endure a more limited role in another tight-knit group this summer. According to the 24-year-old his time with England at the World Cup taught him how to be a proactive squad member, even if you\u2019re not in the first XI. \u201cObviously it was difficult for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t play as much in the World Cup as I wanted to. So I tried to react to that in the best possible way. It\u2019s not nice, not playing, but you have to try and be ready and try to help the team in different ways. That was an experience I learned a lot from.\u201d Of course there were other, more straightforwardly positive aspects of the World Cup, such as sealing England\u2019s first penalty shootout victory for 22 years. \u201cWhenever I am out and about, it\u2019s the only thing people talk about,\u201d says Dier of his decisive spot-kick against Colombia, the moment that surely caused the greatest excitement in England\u2019s run to the semi-finals. \u201cI spoke to Harry Kane about it the day after, and we were saying that when you\u2019re standing there on the halfway line, you\u2019re nervous. But once I was standing there to take it I was actually quite calm. It was nice. But there were five people that took penalties and there were 15 that played 120 minutes and the whole squad that trained all week to be in the place that we were.\u201d Confidence, determination, a belief in the collective. When it comes to expressing what he believes in, just as he is on the pitch, Dier does not muck about."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
