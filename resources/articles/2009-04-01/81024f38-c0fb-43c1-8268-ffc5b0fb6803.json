Can you point me towards the relevant people we would need to talk to? SR A If your plans involve splitting the property into two separate homes, your first port of call should be the planning department of your local council because you are likely to need planning permission. They will also be able to advise you on what building regulations you will need to comply with, such as minimum standards for sound proofing and insulation. Then you will need to talk to the utility companies so that each address has its own gas, electricity and water meters. Finally, you will need a solicitor to advise you on ownership of the freehold and drawing up leases for the separate dwellings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
