Liverpool face their former winger on Saturday for the first time since he departed Anfield in acrimonious fashion to become the most expensive English footballer of all time. Sterling followed Luis Su\u00e1rez, and Fernando Torres before them, in seeking silverware away from the club who have won the league title 18 times, when he joined City in a deal rising to \u00a349m this summer, having rejected Liverpool\u2019s offer of a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract extension. Klopp, on his sabbatical when Sterling joined City, refused to comment on the controversial transfer or the player\u2019s actions, saying only he had been told the 20-year-old \u201cwas a good boy\u201d. The manager preferred to reflect on what the saga meant to his own club, and believes Liverpool must ensure the next talent to emerge has no reason to look beyond Anfield for success. \u201cThe will of the player is always very important,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Sterling\u2019s story but I know about similar stories and it is normal. This is Mario G\u00f6tze\u2019s story with Dortmund. You cannot hold the player when he doesn\u2019t want to be there. It doesn\u2019t work. So you have to take the money and do something smart with it. The only thing is how you react on this. First of all we have to try to become a club in the future that nobody wants to leave. Then we will have the problem that we have to send some players away because we have too many! That is ultimately what we have to do. And it\u2019s possible \u2013 the weather in Manchester is not that much better than Liverpool so that is not the biggest advantage. \u201cIt is a long, long journey but we have started it and we want to do this. We don\u2019t have to talk about the past and not about Sterling. He\u2019s a brilliant player, everybody knows this. Now he\u2019s at Manchester City so we close the book. We have other good players, really good players, and that is what we have to think about.\u201d Klopp admits he would rather develop a team than pay exorbitant prices for players but, despite his experiences with Bayern Munich after turning Borussia Dortmund into champions of Germany, insists he has no problem with the path taken by City. He explained: \u201cIt\u2019s better you have players in your own squad that are worth \u00a3100m and don\u2019t want to leave, that\u2019s the best thing. This is what we try to do for the future. The truth is I like to build up teams, it\u2019s what I really like in football, but I have no problem with a different way. I\u2019m not here at Liverpool because we cannot buy expensive players! No, no, no; different reasons.\u201d Bayern lured G\u00f6tze and Robert Lewandowski from Dortmund during Klopp\u2019s reign, with damaging consequences for Borussia, but the German coach insists money will not define Liverpool\u2019s chances against City in the long term. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t compete off the pitch but on the pitch, yes, of course we could compete. That\u2019s normal, that\u2019s what I love most about football,\u201d said Klopp of his Bundesliga rivalry. \u201cIt\u2019s not important what you spend, it\u2019s not important who you are; it\u2019s only important what you want to do, and what you want to do together. \u201cOf course we can play against them. Of course we can beat them. I don\u2019t know if we can do it on Saturday but of course we can. We beat City in Dortmund and drew in Manchester. They had more money but that\u2019s not what\u2019s important. It\u2019s only a big, big thing to talk about here. I\u2019m six weeks here but compared to Germany \u2013 where only two clubs sometimes talk about money \u2013 all the rest don\u2019t talk about money and that\u2019s because there is a big difference between Bayern and the rest because they don\u2019t have that much. So they try to do their best. \u201cMoney is only one part of success. The rest is work. That is what we are doing. We don\u2019t think about Manchester City. There is no decision about the result on Saturday so we can fight for it. That\u2019s all I need. The rest is not interesting for me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
