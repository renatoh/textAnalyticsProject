But at the time of the dinosaurs the continent was covered in swampy rainforest. Now experts say they have found the most southerly evidence yet of this environment in plant material extracted from beneath the seafloor in west Antarctica. The Cretaceous, 145m to 66m years ago, was a warm period during which Earth had a greenhouse climate and vegetation grew in Antarctica. Scientists say the new discovery not only reveals that swampy rainforests were thriving near the south pole about 90m years ago but that temperatures were higher than expected. Such conditions, they add, could only have been produced if carbon dioxide levels were far higher than previously thought and there were no glaciers in the region. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that this Cretaceous greenhouse climate was that extreme,\u201d said Dr Johann Klages of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany and a co-author of the research. \u201cIt shows us what carbon dioxide is able to do.\u201d Writing in the journal Nature, the team explained how, in 2017, they drilled a narrow hole down into the seafloor near the Pine Island glacier in west Antarctica. This location is about 2,000km (1,200 miles) from today\u2019s south pole, but about 90m years ago it was about 900km from the pole. The hole was drilled and material extracted using a remotely operated rig. \u201cIt is like a spaceship sitting on the seafloor,\u201d said Klages. The first few metres of material were glacial sediment, dating to about 25,000 years ago, while the next 25m were sandstone, dating to about 45m years ago \u2013 something Klages said was of little interest to the team. As they worked, a huge field of sea ice was approaching. \u201cIt was getting a little dangerous,\u201d said Klages. \u201cWe said: \u2018OK, three more metres and then we can evacuate the coring site here.\u2019 And in this three metres we had this exciting new material.\u201d This three-metre section was composed of mudstone, topped by a coal-like material, and packed with soil from the ancient forest, complete with roots, spores and pollen \u2013 with the latter identified as coming from plants including conifer trees and ferns. \u201cIt is like if you would go to a forest near your house somewhere and drill a hole into the forest soil,\u201d said Klages. \u201cIt is really pristine \u2026 it was amazing.\u201d The team found evidence of more than 65 different kinds of plants within the material, revealing that the landscape near the south pole would have been covered in a swampy conifer rainforest similar to that found today in the north-western part of the South Island of New Zealand. The material was dated to between 92m and 83m years ago. It would have had average annual temperatures of 12-13C (53-55F), \u201cwhich is warmer than in Germany today\u201d, Klages said, adding that analysis of chemicals left by photosynthetic organisms called cyanobacteria revealed that surface waters, for example of lakes, would have been a pleasant 20C. Crucially, said Kages, computer modelling shows that such an environment so close to the south pole \u2013 where in the winter there is darkness for four months \u2013 would only have been possible if greenhouse gas concentrations were far higher than previously thought and the land surface were covered in vegetation. In other words there were no ice sheets present \u2013 something Klages noted had been a matter of debate. Dr James Bendle, an expert in organic geochemistry from the University of Birmingham, said that studying the Antarctic ecosystem was hugely important in understanding past and future climate change, adding that unabated use of fossil fuels use could push concentrations of carbon dioxide to levels similar to those 90m years ago by the start of the next century. \u201cUltimately, if we have an atmosphere of more than 1,000 parts per million of carbon dioxide, we are committing ourselves to a future planet that has little to no ice, and ultimately an Antarctic continent that would be vegetated and wouldn\u2019t have an ice cover,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
