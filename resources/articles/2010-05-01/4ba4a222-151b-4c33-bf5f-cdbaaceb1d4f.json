Flamenco Sin Fronteras shows how mass migrations during the early-20th century led to fascinating links being forged between the dance and music of both cultures, as Pe\u00f1a's own company party on stage with a troupe of Venezuelan dancers, singers and musicians. The production, directed by Jude Kelly, features some virtuoso performances: the Venezuelan drummers are thrilling, delivering a deep, earthy and larky counterpoint to the Spanish music; dancers Ram\u00f3n Martin\u00e9z, Angel Mu\u00f1oz and Charo Espino cover the gamut of style and expression; and Pe\u00f1a is still master of his form, extending from limpid classicism to raw emotion. Salisbury City Hall, Tue; The Sage, Gateshead, Thu Kabuki, London Ebizo Ichikawa XI is a star on two counts. As a direct descendent of the 17th-century Ichikawa acting dynasty, he now ranks as one of the great Kabuki performers of his generation. But he is also a celebrity actor in Japanese film and television, combining modern glamour with traditional dedication. This week he heads a 40-strong cast of performers and musicians in a performance of the epic play Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura (Yoshitsune And The Thousand Cherry Trees). It's a work that's hugely popular in Japan, in part because of its dazzling stage trickery. Ebizo is cast in the lead double role of a loyal servant and enigmatic fox spirit, allowing him to show to his full his vocal and physical virtuosity. Sadler's Wells, EC1, Fri to 15 Jun Tacita Dean: Craneway Event, London When Tacita Dean began filming Merce Cunningham rehearsing with his company in November 2008, she had no idea that this was to be the choreographer's last film collaboration; he died six months later. The location was a former Ford assembly plant in California, a classic 1930s Albert Kahn building in which Cunningham had chosen to stage one of his events. Dean was with the company over three days, watching Cunningham organise his choreography around the enormous space. With three sides of the building glazed, the dancers were working against the backdrop of the San Francisco Bay. Dean's film is not only a study of Cunningham's working process but of the patterns of birds, ships, light and water that created its randomly shifting frame. A fine and tender homage.
