Gentle hearts are normally strangled by screaming guitars. But Biffy Clyro are different, juggling anger with adoration as they take indie sensitivity and embolden it with blistering rock fury. Recorded in one day, The Vertigo of Bliss crackles with certainty. The Ideal Height twists into a stream of fuzzy, chugging guitars before falling to a reflective melody. Questions and Answers is a catchy cacophony, Simon Neil's vocals looming low under the high harmonies of Ben and James Johnston. \"You are the summer I'll feel for ever,\" Neil sings in Eradicate the Doubt, his warm and cuddly notions needled by awkward guitars, heavy drums dragging him into a boy's own adventure of haphazard rhythms and conflicting chords. Inventive and sublime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
