We're going to get this guy back.\" The scene was a Cabinet Office room in Whitehall on Saturday August 26 1995. The intelligence officers, civil servants and military personnel gathered at the meeting of Cobra, the secret committee summoned for major emergencies, were impressed by the junior Foreign Office minister. Few realised that he had hijacked a famous line from Apollo 13, the movie about a stricken spaceship. But over the following hour, the experts confirmed their judgment about that weekend's duty minister, one David Davis. The 14 men had been summoned following the kidnap of Sergeant Tim Cowley, an assistant to the defence attache at the British embassy in Bogot\u00e1. Colombian criminals had seized Cowley, 32, while he was birdwatching in the countryside. A ransom demand was expected, which the British government would reject. Cowley could only hope that a British SAS group would pinpoint his captors' hideout in the Andes and rescue him before he was murdered. \"One solid mistake over the following weeks,\" Davis was told, \"will guarantee Cowley's death.\" But Davis, after a year's training as a Territorial in the SAS and a pre-Westminster career as an industrial troubleshooter, was unusually qualified as a politician to ask the right questions and give cool leadership. Four months later, in the midst of a gunfight, Cowley was rescued. At a discreet party in the Foreign Office to welcome Cowley back, Davis presented him with a gift wrapped in Christmas paper: a toy Action Man. Participants of the Cobra meetings at that celebration described Davis as an \"extremely good manager\" and a \"hard-working man, able to master a complex brief\", whose \"relaxed manner could be misinterpreted by some as a lack of s\u00e9rieux \". That \"misinterpretation\" is widely shared among Davis's critics in Westminster, who have accused him of egoism, shallowness and phony bravado. Their hatred is raw, especially since Davis is favourite to become the party's next leader. As the post-election exhaustion among Michael Howard's closest advisers turns to frustration, they have focused their anger on his \"idleness\" and \"disloyalty\" during the unsuccessful campaign, painting a picture of an uneducated adventurer, unskilled in spreading emollience and philosophically ignorant. To their irritation, Davis's statesmanlike performance this week, following the terrorist attacks on London, has only enhanced his claim to lead the party. His quiet, magisterial condemnation of the bombings in the Commons on Thursday overshadowed the home secretary's own performance. That success infuriated those angered by Davis's ambitions. Davis's detractors are concentrated in two groups. First, there are the older Conservatives, mostly privately educated Eurosceptics and traditionalists who now pose as modernisers. The second group are the so-called \"Notting Hill\" set: thirtysomething, articulate, intelligent Londoners, they seek to recapture the centre ground dominated by Blairism. Led by George Osborne, Ed Vaisey, Michael Gove and especially David Cameron, they accuse Davis of being a disloyal master plotter. What the detractors might be said to have in common is that many are products of Oxbridge. Sophisticated, wealthy and cliquish, their resistance to Davis could be explained by class: Tory toffs who dislike the working-class product of a single-parent family. Pertinently, the last outsider resented by traditionalist Tories was Margaret Thatcher. Like Davis, she was criticised before her selection as leader 30 years ago for lacking ideas, and was lampooned even after her election as \"Hilda\". Yet within five years Thatcher had restored the Tories' fortunes. Davis's friends resist the comparison with Thatcher, but there are similarities. Hungry for decades to become the party's leader, Davis has a political vision as simple and unsophisticated as was Thatcher's appeal to the common man. Accused of not having developed his principles in the past 20 years to match changes in society, he replies: \"My principles are 200 years old: low taxation, a small state, and help for those in need.\" Compared to the modernisers, who discuss convoluted rainbow coalitions to restore Tory fortunes, Davis's approach looks populist and uncomplicated. But by travelling lightly, promising merely to raise the opportunities and expectations of those at the bottom of society, he evokes suspicion among those spouting cultural gestures and promoting open-neck shirts or liberalism on drugs as proof of \"modernisation\". Davis expects success, and that self-belief irritates his opponents. His hurdle is to convince Tory traditionalists and intellectuals that Britain's multiculturalist voters, especially the young and female, can be persuaded to trust the Tories once again to fulfil their aspirations. As well as economic freedom, Davis makes much of his commitment to social freedom, and mentions his personal experience as his qualification to overcome working-class prejudice. By comparison, says one of his Westminster friends, \"the closest the Notting Hill people come to workers is when their window cleaner calls once a month\". To Davis's credit, when he first arrived in Westminster, most Tories were unaware of his impoverished background. Soon after his birth in York on December 23 1948, his natural father disappeared, leaving his son to be brought up by his grandparents in a prefabricated home in Walmgate, near the city wall. When he was seven, his mother Betty Brown met and married Ronald Davis, a manual worker, and they moved to Wandsworth in south London. The small flat was \"a terrible little slum\", says Davis. Nevertheless, moving to London transformed his life. A teacher called Williams taught him to read and write in one term, and remains his hero. But he learned through personal experience the importance of stimulating ambition in those at the bottom of society: education alone was not enough. Tough upbringing After Davis's half-sister Pauline was born, the family was allocated a flat in Aboyne, a council estate in Tooting. By then, Ron Davis was a politically active shop steward at Battersea power station and David Davis had discovered that his grandfather Walter Harrison (his mother's stepfather) had been a shop steward and a communist agitator who had led part of the Jarrow march, Davis was naturally to the left. By his own account, school, even for ambitious working-class children at Tooting Bec grammar, was an unremitting challenge. Fights were common: on one notable occasion he successfully confronted a gang who had terrorised and attacked a fellow pupil who was gay. More than 30 years later, a newspaper tracked down the assailants who mournfully recalled Davis's retributive assault. His damaged nose (broken five times so far) and a long scar above his lip, inflicted by a crowbar during another fight in Brixton, mark Davis as either reckless or brave. On the eve of taking his physics A-level, Davis argued again with his stepfather, whom he blamed for being jealous of his relationship with his mother. He fled to live with a female friend of his mother in Battersea: he would not see or speak to his mother for five years. Today he remains strangely unconcerned about his mother's sentiments. He is also unemotional about their eventual reconciliation, showing more enthusiasm for his stepfather's funeral: \"It was fascinating - like a Mafia dream. There were hundreds of people there. All these people I didn't know came up to me and shook my hand, saying, 'You're the young Mr Davis.' \" Soon after, he secretly searched for and found his natural father, who had married and lived with his family. Davis pledged not to reveal his identity and would, until 2005, misleadingly insist, \"I have never contacted him. I don't even know if he is still alive.\" After he failed his A-level, Davis's parents refused him any further help in securing him a university place. At 18, he became an emotionally deaf individualist whose survival depended upon resolute self-confidence. He worked as a clerk in an insurance company and joined the Territorial branch of the SAS to earn the money to fund retaking the examinations: the SAS Territorials were the hardest to join, but paid the most. He was taught to handle explosives, and excelled at physical endurance, especially playing rugby. Today, Davis's worst critics carp about his SAS credentials being as phony as his broken nose. He is \"a tough guy who hasn't achieved anything and doesn't even read books\", according to one disdainful Tory. Some feel that his \"basher\" image suggests a lack of intellectual power to develop the party's philosophy. Despite performing badly again in his A-levels, Davis arrived at Warwick University in 1968 to study molecular science. After the enforced gap year he was more mature and more politically interested than his contemporaries. Davis remembers a challenge to Germaine Greer, a university lecturer, during a debate about feminism: \"What has your philosophy to offer the single mum living at the top of a tower block in Coventry?\" she was asked. He was unimpressed by her reply; the student sit-ins and protests against the Vietnam war also contributed to an increasing alienation from the left. By the end of his first year, besides single-handedly establishing Radio Warwick, Davis had become preoccupied by Iain Macleod's One Nation Conservatism. The political conversion was consummated at meetings of the Federation of Conservative Students, a political hothouse attracting many who would become famous. By the early 70s, the smiling rugby player with the flat voice had attracted substantial support in the federation. In 1973, he stood for the chairmanship against Neil Hamilton, later to become notorious for his involvement in the al-Fayed bribery scandal, and Tony Baldry, the current MP for Banbury. On the eve of the election, Baldry, the favourite, was encouraged to drink excessively - some say at Davis's expense. In the event, Baldry was urged by Davis's supporters to make an impromptu speech in the bar. \"We've got Thatcher by the short and curlies,\" the Heathite slurred, reeling across the floor. By daybreak, his vote had evaporated. Hamilton's speech the following day was brilliant, hilarious and so rightwing that he attracted no support. Davis's leftish speech won the vote even though it was atrociously delivered. As chairman of the federation, he was on the first rung to becoming party leader: \"The bright star of my generation,\" according to his friend and fellow Tory, John Blundell. In that year, he married Doreen Cook, who had also studied molecular science at Warwick and become a teacher. A striking redhead, she was going out with someone else when they met. \"I won her over with persistence, tenacity and doggedness,\" recalls Davis. They settled in Clapham, south London, amid a small circle of loyal friends, and he completed a two-year course at the London Business School. Julian Franks, his tutor in corporate finance, recalls Davis's \"impressive intellect and tremendous energy\". Getting his hands dirty Unlike his fellow students, Davis did not seek a job at McKinseys, the management consultant, or a blue-chip multinational corporation. He applied to Rank Xerox and Silver Roadways, the transport division of sugar manufacturer Tate &amp; Lyle. \"I wanted to get my hands dirty and learn the nitty-gritty,\" he says. The interview room at Tate &amp; Lyle was illuminated by a gas lamp. In the midst of the three-day week, the executive moaned, \"It's the end of civilisation as we know it.\" \"Don't be daft,\" replied Davis, \"it's just another strike.\" Over the next 13 years at Tate &amp; Lyle, while the Tory party recovered to trounce Labour in 1979, Davis was quietly building an unspectacular career with an unglamorous corporation, and enjoying family life with two daughters (a son was born later). Ceaselessly, he encouraged his daughters' academic work, moving to Croydon to be close to a better state school, and teaching them to ski, scuba-dive and rock-climb. His ambition was rewarded when both daughters won places at Oxbridge. In 1982, Davis's career was improved by a two-year mission to rescue a failing subsidiary in Canada. His successful troubleshooting was rewarded by his becoming the company's director of strategic planning in London. He also wrote abook called \"How to Turn Round a Company\", a potential blueprint for transforming a political party. By the end he was a committed free-marketeer, convinced above all that the NHS could only be efficient by contracting out services. The return to England invigorated his interest in politics. Eager to enter parliament, he rebuilt his relationship with the party by canvassing during various election campaigns, meeting the party's leaders and reading Hyeck, Friedman and Popper to understand modern social and economic theories. In 1987, he applied to become the candidate in Boothferry, a safe seat in Yorkshire. Few rated his chances as a first-time applicant, but he won the nomination; two weeks later, Michael Heseltine arrived in the constituency. Hearing about Davis's easy political career, he advised: \"I'd keep quiet about that if I were you.\" The election was won easily with a 54.8% share of the vote. Leaving London - a bonus for his wife, who disliked city life - Davis bought a 17-acre farm in the constituency. He undertook what was to become an annual pilgrimage: a 192-mile walk from Bees Head in the Lake District to Robin Hood's Bay in North Yorkshire. His study at home was filled with computer equipment, gadgets and books on everything from technology and military history to mythology, anthropology and psychology. His heroes are \"outsiders who made it\": Wellington, Disraeli and Gladstone. Aged 38 when he was elected, Davis's professional career at that time was not exceptional among MPs, although his burning ambition was clear to some. As Alan Clark wrote in his diary after one of Davis's visits to Saltwood, Clark's castle in Kent, Davis had completed the \"black route without turning a hair, then retraced his footsteps, hands in pockets - first time that's ever been done\". The \"black route\" was walking along the unprotected battlements above an uninterrupted 50ft drop. The visitor was described by Clark as \"clever, tough and congenial\"; in front of his log fire, Clark confided to Jonathan Aitken that he could imagine Davis as a good Tory leader. In 1989, Davis climbed the first rung on the ministerial ladder, becoming a parliamentary undersecretary at the DTI and working briefly for Francis Maude. The following year, he voted against Thatcher's withdrawal of free eye tests. Whether Thatcher acknowledged his protest in her final, tumultuous months is unknown, but in November 1990, the new prime minister John Major rewarded an early supporter by appointing Davis as a junior whip. The year after the 1992 election was tumultuous for the government and for Davis. After quitting the ERM, the government, with a majority of just 21, was rocked by its eurosceptic MPs, eager to prevent ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Saving the government in the lobbies was the responsibility of Davis, who became known as \"the Hammer of Maastricht\". His soft-spoken brutality won praise even from his adversaries - and a mention in one newspaper as a potential leader. \"He was quiet and courteous,\" recalls Teddy Taylor, one of the Tory rebels. \"Unlike other whips, he was never horrible.\" But to Davis, any praise for saving the government was a mixed blessing. By conviction, Davis was eurosceptic, especially after his experience in Canada convinced him that subsidies for EU sugar beet distorted world markets. But hardened Euro-sceptics developed a grudge against Davis that some still recall. His success did, however, stir John Major to offer him in 1993 the post of minister of state in the Foreign Office, specialising in Europe. \"Douglas Hurd wants you,\" said Major. \"Not on your bloody life,\" Davis replied. Loyal and ambitious, he succumbed, however, and believes that his relationship with the Euro-phile Hurd was good. Others are less sure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
