Gareth Southgate's England Under-21 squad have checked out after various guests reported falling ill and Hodgson has been advised to keep his players away from the Staffordshire venue or risk them going down with the same bug. Hodgson, who is planning to name Frank Lampard as England's captain to commemorate the midfielder's achievement in becoming the eighth player to win 100 caps for his country, has been informed the virus affected \"a small number of visitors\" over the weekend. The Football Association has arranged a block booking at The Grove in Watford and a statement said none of the Under-21 players, who have been on the site since Sunday, had experienced any symptoms. \"This is an elite-athlete precaution for the two senior teams,\" it added. \"Normal operations continue for the St George's Park and hotel staff, customers and the public.\" Hodgson's next concern when the squad meet on Tuesday will be the fitness of several key players, with Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge, Michael Carrick, Danny Welbeck and Jack Wilshere to be monitored by the FA's medical staff. Lampard's promotion to captain adds to the sense that Gerrard, carrying a slight hip injury, may be rested until the game against Germany next Tuesday. Lampard reached his century in the World Cup qualifier in Ukraine in September and will be presented with a commemorative golden cap before the kick-off at Wembley. His daughters, Luna and Isla, will be mascots. The Chelsea player's inclusion will allow Roy Hodgson to experiment with younger players, such as Ross Barkley of Everton, Liverpool's Jordan Henderson and Southampton's Adam Lallana, around him. Lampard, who normally operates as Gerrard's understudy for the captaincy, is then expected to drop to the substitutes' bench against Germany. Carrick is expected to withdraw from the 28-man party after saying he was \"a bit patched-up to play\" in Sunday's Premier League victory over Arsenal at Old Trafford. The 32-year-old has been struggling with an achilles problem and left the stadium in some discomfort, admitting it \"doesn't look too good\". Hodgson will need to check on Wilshere's fitness given his latest bout of ankle problems \u2013 the Arsenal player featured only as a substitute, for 29 minutes, at United \u2013 with the extent of his involvement unclear, along with that of Welbeck. The United forward has been struggling with a knee injury and has not played for his club since the home draw with Southampton in mid-October. The uncapped Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster is expected to start against Chile, with Norwich's John Ruddy replacing him at half-time to ensure both of Joe Hart's understudies have opportunities to impress. The Manchester City goalkeeper would then begin against Germany. Hart, who has sat out his club side's last three fixtures, has benefited from public backing from the former England goalkeeper David Seaman. \"Hart is brilliant,\" Seaman, who was capped 74 times, told Talksport. \"I was surprised he was dropped by City. He's a quality goalkeeper and is playing big pressure games every week and you can't say that about the other goalkeepers. He's by far our best keeper and I was glad Roy [Hodgson] came out and backed him. That's what you want as a goalkeeper. It's a shame his own [club] manager hasn't backed him as well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
