Wenger has been rocked by the loss of Mesut \u00d6zil to an unspecified injury and the midfielder has joined Laurent Koscielny, Nacho Monreal, Sead Kolasinac, Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud on the casualty list for Stamford Bridge. Wenger is particularly stretched in defence and he will include the new signing Konstantinos Mavropanos among his substitutes. The 20-year-old centre-half arrived last week from PAS Giannina in Greece and Wenger\u2019s plan was to loan him out. \u201cHe\u2019s not ready to play for us,\u201d the manager said last Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll give him out on loan.\u201d David Ospina will start against Chelsea, in place of the first-choice goalkeeper, Petr Cech, but Wenger will otherwise pick his strongest available team, including S\u00e1nchez. City have wanted S\u00e1nchez since the summer, when they made an attempt to sign him, and, with the 29-year-old running down his Arsenal contract, they have been confident of signing him as a Bosman free agent at the end of the season. Pep Guardiola will be without Gabriel Jesus for two months because of a medial collateral ligament injury and this has increased the City manager\u2019s desire to sign S\u00e1nchez now. City have opened talks with Arsenal and have indicated a willingness to pay \u00a320m. S\u00e1nchez, who played under Guardiola at Barcelona, is now permitted to discuss terms with overseas clubs, with Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich believed to have shown an interest. But City remain the frontrunners for his signature. A contract worth \u00a313m a season until 2023 \u2013 or \u00a3250,000 a week \u2013 is understood to have been offered to S\u00e1nchez\u2019s representatives. Wenger was asked whether he expected S\u00e1nchez to stay at Arsenal in January. \u201cI expect nothing,\u201d he said. City agreed a deal for S\u00e1nchez last August worth \u00a355m plus \u00a35m in add-ons only for it to collapse when Arsenal failed to sign Monaco\u2019s Thomas Lemar as a replacement. Arsenal had offered \u00a392m for him, which was accepted by Monaco, but there was insufficient time for the player to agree to the move. Arsenal would rekindle their interest in Lemar if S\u00e1nchez left now. The Monaco manager, Leonardo Jardim, said earlier this week the versatile 22-year-old could be on his way this month, although Arsenal are also believed to be interested in Leicester\u2019s Riyad Mahrez and Cristian Pav\u00f3n of Boca Juniors. \u201cWe are not used to selling in the winter,\u201d Jardim said. \u201cBut the transfer window lasts until the end of the month and many things can happen.\u201d Wenger is expected to move out Francis Coquelin this month, with Valencia, Crystal Palace and West Ham United having been linked to the midfielder. Coquelin is fit and he trained on Tuesday but he is not expected to be involved at Chelsea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
