The direct medical costs of treating 2.2 million patients in hospital critical care beds could amount to an estimated $16.28bn, while the focus on coronavirus could also lead to a diversion of scarce health resources, leading to a further 1.7 million preventable deaths from HIV, TB and malaria. The findings \u2013 prepared for the UN by the economics department at Oxford \u2013 are designed as a call to arms as G20 finance ministers prepare to meet this weekend. UN officials are deeply concerned that as the pandemic recedes in Europe, the impacts of the virus and of the global recession on the world\u2019s poorest are already being forgotten. Much of the projected poverty worldwide will come from social distancing measures put in place to reduce deaths but liable to devastate local economies. The UN emergency relief coordinator, Mark Lowcock, warned: \u201cCovid-19 and the associated global recession are about to wreak havoc in fragile and low-income countries. My message is that unless the rich countries and the G20 are prepared to act now we must be prepared for a series of human tragedies more brutal and destructive than any direct impacts in the virus itself. If the virus is free to circle the globe it will undo decades of development work and create a generation\u2019s worth of tragic and exportable problems.\u201d Lowcock\u2019s warning came as he launched a third appeal for a coronavirus humanitarian response, saying the updated plan needed $10.3bn, up from an initial appeal for $2bn in March. The appeal is intended to help 63 vulnerable countries and 200 million people, compared with the 108 million that the UN had been planning to target at the start of the year before the epidemic. Some of the money is designed to keep frontline NGOs afloat, as well as cover UN transportation made necessary by the collapse of civilian airlines. Altogether, the sum represents the single largest appeal ever made in the 75-year history of the UN. Officials are hoping humanitarian aid will be included in the EU seven-year budget framework and in the planned US stimulus budget. Lowcock said that the first UN appeal in March had so far raised only $1.7bn, and pointed to a decline in generosity from Gulf countries this year. He described the response by most wealthy countries as \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d and \u201cdangerously short-sighted\u201d. He added: \u201cMy message to the G20 is step up now or pay the price later.\u201d The contrast between the effectiveness and energy that went into the global response at the time of the financial crisis in 2008 was striking and dangerous, he said. He said the overall long-term cost of protecting the poorest 32 countries was $90bn \u2013 less than 1% of the cost of the wealthy west\u2019s various stimulus packages \u2013 and argued that if the world\u2019s poorest countries were not protected the chances would increase of a second wave of the virus sweeping back into Europe, leading to possible output loss of \u00a31.1tn in the advanced economies. Overall, he warned the virus might cause the first absolute rise in poverty since 1990, with 70-100 million people pushed into the extreme poverty category of less than $1.90 income a day and a possible doubling of those facing famine. The Oxford report also suggests that a school shutdown spanning five months could generate learning losses that have a present value of $10tn globally. Without remediation the average student could face a reduction of $16,000 in earnings over a lifetime in present value terms. At a macro scale, 16% of global investments made in the basic education of the current cohort could go to waste. Lowcock also said that school closures in turn affected human nutrition, pointing to Nigeria where school closures had reduced the food intake of nearly 7 million children enrolled in the country\u2019s school feeding programme. The economy of sub-Saharan Africa is predicted to contract by -3.2%; that of the Middle East and central Asia by -4.7%, Latin America and the Caribbean by -9.4% and low- and middle-income countries in Asia by -0.8%, largely swayed by China\u2019s growth projection of 1%. The UN report said these projections reflected the broadest collapse in per-capita income since 1870. \u201cNevertheless, these annualised GDP projections fail to capture the extent to which millions of people will experience transient poverty in response to Covid-19. In the absence of social security to smooth this shock, income losses of these magnitudes will have severe consequences for the livelihoods and wellbeing of people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
