Yesterday the clouds, mist, thunder and lightning came and went, but Lance Armstrong was immutable and his rivals simply evaporated. The race lead is not his - yet - but the race is now his to lose. Each of Armstrong's first four Tour wins followed the same pattern, with the Texan taking a psychological stranglehold on the first mountain-top finish. The locations changed, the pattern was the same at Sestrieres in 1999, Hautacam in 2000, l'Alpe d'Huez in 2001 and here, close to the top of the Col du Tourmalet, in 2002. Whereas in 2003 at l'Alpe d'Huez Iban Mayo and Alexander Vinokourov had the edge, yesterday Armstrong reverted to type. There was no one fulminating attack but, as one by one Tyler Hamilton, Jan Ullrich and Roberto Heras faded on the one-in-10-slopes, Armstrong applied the screw until only one man remained with him, the Italian Ivan Basso, the best young rider in the 2002 Tour, who was permitted to take the stage win. Seeing every heavyweight rival struggling probably surpassed even Armstrong's wildest hopes. \"I don't know how surprised you were, but I was pretty surprised,\" he said. \"Today we started confidently. I felt good for most of the day. We have the best team in the race; the question is whether or not the leader is the best.\" There was little argument about that one. There was no chance that Armstrong would relieve the young Frenchman Thomas Voeckler of his yellow jersey, but he almost halved Voeckler's lead of 9min 35sec, in a single ascent, and is now only 5:24 behind. Voeckler is suffering from \"minor digestive troubles\". Ullrich, Mayo and the rest merely looked to have little stomach for the fight. Ullrich, his face a mask of pain on the first climb, ceded 2:30 and was outshone by his domestique Andreas Kl\u00f6den. Heras ceded 2:57 and Hamilton a shocking 3:27. For a rider who has built his season about the Tour, this was astonishing. He has apparently been hit hard by the death of his dog, Tugboat, and yesterday his tail was very much between his legs. Today the kaleidoscope will be shaken again, but on yesterday's showing the men who will worry Armstrong this week come from two teams, the nominally Danish CSC, and the Spanish of the Balearic Islands squad, formerly Miguel Indurain's Banesto. Both have one advantage: numbers. CSC have Basso, who looked more comfortable climbing to the finish than Armstrong, the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Bobby Julich, and Illes Baleares can count on the Spanish national champion Francisco Mancebo and the Russian Denis Menchov. Apocalyptic is a term used by the French media to describe anything from an April shower, but yesterday it would have been no surprise to see the Four Horsemen whirling over the Pic du Midi and descending through the thick cloud to the concrete apartment blocks as the hills echoed to the sound of thunder and torrential rain. Although by the time the riders arrived the sun had returned. The Basques were out in force, as they always are when the Tour nears Spain. Some 85,000 are expected this weekend, and at least half of them turned up here. Their orange T-shirts, hats and shorts, even orange codpieces proclaiming the liberty of Euskadi were sodden but proud. Sadly, Mayo was merely sodden, losing a minute to Armstrong and any faint hopes of a place on the podium. Voeckler punctured at the worst possible moment, just as the peloton was gathering pace up the valley before the Col d'Aspin. He regained contact, strove manfully up the Aspin, but by the end of the stage his fight to retain his lead had a desperate feel as he zigzagged up the final kilometre, sometimes almost coming to a halt before regaining momentum. Clouds of controversy still swirl around Armstrong. The question yesterday was whether his Czech team-mate Pavel Padrnos would be able to continue in the race. Padrnos will appear in a court in San Remo on October 27 charged with possession of a doping product and the Tour organisers had asked the race referees for permission to exclude him. The Professional Cycling Council, the arm of cycling's governing body which deals with professional racing, blocked the move, on the ground that Padrnos's national federation had cleared him because the product involved is not on the banned list. The PCC also requested that another rider, Stefano Zanini, remain in the race because he has served a seven-month suspension. Patrice Clerc, head of the Tour organiser Amaury Sport Organisation, said ASO had appealed against the decision and he hinted that if the difference were not resolved the Tour organisers might not cooperate with the International Cycling Union's (UCI) new ProTour, which will radically change the structure of the sport next year. \"There is a real conflict in the positions of the UCI and Tour organisers,\" he said. \"It has to be clarified in the next few weeks or ASO will not take part in the reorganisation of cycling.\" Today the race heads east, with two first- and two second-category climbs before the finish, 5,000 feet up at the ski station of Plateau de Beille. In 2002, having won at La Mongie, Armstrong took an impregnable lead there, and he noted yesterday that \"the stages are in the same order this year, and I remember then I felt better on the second day\". History did not quite repeat itself yesterday but, given that the verdict of the first mountaintop finish rarely lies, he may well be in yellow this afternoon. Hamilton's loss tugs at hearts Tyler Hamilton, the US cyclist riding in the Tour de France who had to have his golden retriever Tugboat put down after it developed cancer, has been flooded with messages of sympathy on his website. One fan wrote: \"Let us carry that grief for you while you finish the Tour. And let us know how we can best honour his memory. Win for Tugs! We're all still with you!\" Hamilton wore a black armband on the Tour on Thursday. sport.theguardian.com/ tourdefrance2004"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
