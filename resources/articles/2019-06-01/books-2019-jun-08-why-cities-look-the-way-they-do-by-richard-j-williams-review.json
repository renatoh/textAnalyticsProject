He feels that, as someone who knows art history, he should relish the experience of walking around its architectural splendours. Instead he admits: \u201cI hate Venice\u201d \u2013 a city that clings to the image of gentle decay and aestheticised ruination that first attracted 18th-century tourists. Prevented from modernising by its heritage status, it is today defined by the circulation of tourists: \u201cThe true spectacle of the contemporary Venice is the tourist industry itself.\u201d In this slim and insightful book, Williams explores cities as the function of financial, social and political processes rather than as the result of \u201cdesign and intention\u201d. His focus is on the cities that aim to attract capital from across the world with glitzy shopping malls, bars, restaurants and galleries that feel disconcertingly similar from Beijing to New York. Williams believes too much attention is lavished on headline-grabbing skyscrapers, such as 432 Park Avenue, Manhattan (\u201ca place to park money, not people\u201d). Instead he takes us deep into the city\u2019s \u201cforest of signs\u201d in order to reveal \u201cthe city hidden in plain sight\u201d. In six fascinating chapters he examines the way in which money, work, political power, war, sexual behaviour and culture shape the appearance of cities. The chapter on work starts with the idea that \u201cthe evisceration of industry is one of the great defining processes of the global city\u201d. It moves on to Amsterdam\u2019s broedplaatsen (breeding places) \u2013 a groundbreaking scheme to seed creative startups in a disused shipyard \u2013 and concludes with Silicon Valley (\u201ca state of mind more than a city\u201d), referring to Seinfeld and Sunset Boulevard on the way. In the chapter on war, he describes how, as the era of total war segues into the war on terror, \u201ca city ostensibly at peace may in reality be violent\u201d. In the 1990s, Rio de Janeiro had a higher murder rate than the besieged city of Sarajevo. On sex, he notes that red light districts have often been subsumed by zones of sexual tolerance, \u201ckey signifiers of globality\u201d. From Manchester\u2019s Gay Village to S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Pride March, \u201cthe capacity of gay culture to generate urban spectacle \u2013 and the attendant capital flows \u2013 is certainly astonishing\u201d. In his conclusion \u2013 which feels like the polemical heart of the book and could be so much longer \u2013 Williams rightly observes that the future of urbanisation may well lie not in spectacular megacities with their soulless towers for the global superrich, but in medium-sized cities such as Leicester. Leicester is, he says, a city \u201cremarkable for its lack of spectacle\u201d. And in its \u201cmixture of grit and neon that flouts conventional good taste\u201d, he finds a visual richness and authenticity that is lacking in many urban areas that strive for global status: \u201cIt has built a life in spite of itself.\u201d \u2022 To buy Why Cities Look the Way They Do go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.
