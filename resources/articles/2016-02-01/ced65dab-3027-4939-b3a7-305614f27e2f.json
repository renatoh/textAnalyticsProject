Itoje impressed when coming on for his debut against Italy earlier this month, replacing James Haskell at flanker, although he has played much of his fledgling career at second-row. Courtney Lawes has been called into Eddie Jones\u2019s squad as a replacement for Launchbury but, given that he was not initially selected, Itoje\u2019s chances of a starting role are favourable. Launchbury had been expected to recover from a hamstring injury but has been ruled out of Saturday\u2019s game at Twickenham and will return to Wasps. Itoje, 21, is regarded as one of England\u2019s brightest prospects and has been dubbed \u201cthe chosen one\u201d by some team-mates because of the immediate impression he has made both with Saracens and at international level. Elliot Daly, the Wasps centre, could also feature against Ireland and the Harlequins full-back Mike Brown believes the future is bright for England. Brown agreed with Eddie Jones\u2019s assertion that England currently have no world-class players in the squad but he believes there is great potential and is relishing the challenge to improve laid down by the Australian. \u201cI said it at the end of the World Cup and there is no change. We\u2019ve only been together four weeks so my view hasn\u2019t changed on that,\u201d Brown said.. \u201cEddie is the boss and he said it, that\u2019s what counts. I said it too but it doesn\u2019t matter what I say, it\u2019s what Eddie says and he has challenged us and now we need to go away and make ourselves world-class players. \u201cEveryone here has been challenged and it is about going away and doing that. If he didn\u2019t think you could make that step up, I don\u2019t think you would be here either. It is up to us now. As a player you just want people to be honest, you want to know what you need to work on. \u201cWe all want to be the best players we can be and if we want to be the best team in the world, we need world-class players. It\u2019s about being honest and we welcome that as players. Anything you might not be that good at, you keep working at and make yourself better. Eddie will tell you what he wants, what he wants you to get better at. He is telling you that because he wants you to be world class.\u201d Brown is expected to be tested by a number of high kicks from Ireland, with Jones already questioning the tactics of Joe Schmidt\u2019s side by describing them as a rugby equivalent to Stoke City. The Ireland centre Jared Payne will test his hamstring on Thursday. Daly is expected to start on the bench for England, having impressed Jones despite the coach previously declaring the 23-year-old was not ready for Test rugby. Brown believes there is vast potential in the England squad and is confident the new talents Daly and Itoje have what it takes to develop and flourish. \u201cWe have got so much talent coming through the age groups,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe have got guys who won Under-20s World Cups who have come in recently and done brilliantly. As long as they keep their heads on right and keep grounded, which they all are at the minute, keep working hard, which they all are at the minute, I have got no doubt they can go on and be world-class players and have a massive impact on the international game. \u201cHe [Daly] is a brilliant player and impressed with the way he has played in the Premiership and then coming into the camp. He is a great smiley lad, brings energy to every session and has been brilliant. It is about him making the next step up.\u201d Steve Borthwick, the England forwards coach, reiterated Jones\u2019s view that a number of players were not fit enough, despite wins over Scotland and Italy, with the Australian saying some were ready for club rugby but not international rugby. Borthwick, who played 57 times for England, said it was up to the players to take the initiative and improve their condition. He said: \u201cAfter one autumn series I took myself off and went to the gym in the evenings, the club was aware of what I was doing, but I wanted to do extra training. Just from an aspect of wrestling and combat fitness, because I believed it was an area that could help me get an edge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
