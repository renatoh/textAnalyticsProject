There were predictions of a growing fans' backlash. An overdue realignment in the relationship between club and supporter. A line in the sand. The broader evidence, alas, does not yet back that up. Despite a raging recession, galloping ticket prices and the growing predictability of the Premier League, fans are still flocking to stadiums, buying the merchandise; sucking it up. The extent of fan \u2013 what is the right word? Loyalty? Lust? \u2013 for football in the modern era is staggering. Between 1983-84 and 1988-89, as Britain boomed, top-flight attendances averaged under 20,000 for four out of six seasons \u2013 yet from 2009 to 2012, with an economy mired in stagnation, average Premier League attendances for each season bobbed gently between 34,215 and 35,363. These figures seem jumbled up, twisted. They are not. And seat occupancy rates \u2013 perhaps a better indicator \u2013 have barely changed either: 92.4% in 2009-10, 92.2% in 2010-11 and 92.6% last season. They may even be rising. According to a league spokesman, seat occupancy is 95% for the 2012-13 season. Those statistics are even more remarkable when you consider how much ticket prices have gone up. A 2011 study by Dave Boyle for the High Pay Centre found the cheapest ticket to see Manchester United in 1989 cost \u00a33.50 \u2013 with Liverpool \u00a34 and Arsenal \u00a35. Adjusted for inflation, those tickets would still have been under \u00a310 in 2011. Instead they went up between 700 and 1,025%. Of course there is churn every season, with some fans deciding enough is enough. But what is striking in the top-flight is how robust this support remains. Take Spurs: White Hart Lane has a capacity of 36,000 \u2013 and a season ticket waiting list of 39,850. How can this be? Fan loyalty, of course, has much to do with it: once you are in, you are often hooked. Although academics differ on how much loyalty affects demand for tickets \u2013 fans are hardly a uniform group \u2013 everyone agrees that for many supporters it is unflinchingly deep. As one study wryly put it: \"How many shoppers will sing 'loyal customers' as they make their weekly shopping trip to Asda?\" That is not new. What has changed during the past decade is the extent to which clubs have massaged this loyalty and cultivated fresh fans. They now know exactly which supporters' buttons to press . As an executive from one Premier League club put it: \"If a club can capture a fan at seven or eight they know the average amount they will make from them in their lifetime. And if they don't know, they're not doing their jobs.\" I know of one club that has investigated how much revenue they might make in future decades by giving every seven-year-old close to their stadium a free team shirt. Clubs would also argue that their product has become classier in the Premier League era, thus justifying higher ticket prices. There is some truth in that. In the 1990s stadiums improved, ensuring hooliganism slunk away from the grounds and middle-class fans felt safer attending. Better players also arrived post Euro 96, further swelling the numbers watching. But it has been only in the last 10-12 years that clubs have zeroed-in on maximising revenue for every seat and supporter. Ticket prices used to vary little between stands or opponents. Now football has become like the theatre, with a wide variety of price points even in the same section of a ground. As professor Robert Simmons of Lancaster University's management school, who has investigated football for two decades, puts it: \"Clubs are cuter than they used to be. They are continually staying one step ahead.\" Dave Boyle, once the chief executive of Supporters Direct, is blunter: \"The clubs have either been incredibly clever, or fans have been incredibly stupid. I think it's more of the latter.\" But while dynamics around every club are unique and constantly changing, a central tenet remains. It's all about supply and demand. \"We just wring it out,\" says one club official. \"We maximise every seat for the highest amount we can get.\" Increasingly that includes using companies such as Viagogo and StubHub to capitalise on the secondary ticket market. Fulham, for instance, have broadened their fan base by advertising in Visit Britain and establishing a neutral section for casual supporters and tourists. Spurs have a scheme for junior members called My Home Debut \u2013 that lets them do a lap of honour to crowd applause before their first game. Indeed, as professor David Forrest of Salford University points out, it could be worse. \"The stadia are so often full, which suggests there is room for further price increases,\" he says. This is not to suggest that aggrieved supporters do not have a legitimate case. Or that the Premier League might yet throw them a bone or two \u2013 such as providing free coach travel for away fans \u2013 because they know that packed stadiums are a major selling point. But while fans continue to display the sort of loyalty that would impress a cocker spaniel, radical change is unlikely. The prices will climb, the tills will trill and the carousel will continue to whirl."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
