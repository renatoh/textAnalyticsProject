The social services minister defended the prime minister, who overnight made structural changes to improve consultation and assuage angry backbenchers in the hope of heading off a challenge. As pressure mounted on Abbott to prove himself after the Coalition\u2019s disastrous Queensland result, Morrison said it was important to remain focused on \u201cwhy the people put you there in the first place\u201d. Asked whether he had been approached about the leadership, Morrison said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t describe it like that.\u201d He described the mention of him as a potential candidate as \u201cfantasy football speculation\u201d, saying: \u201cI would never challenge Tony Abbott. \u201cI accept we have big political problems; the policy problem is the one we are focused on and we have got to do better on the politics and that\u2019s up to all ministers, all members of the government, not just the prime minister.\u201d The two main leadership contenders, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, and the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, urged people to focus on Abbott\u2019s speech to the press club, due at 12.30pm on Monday. \u201cThe only thing we should be interested in on the political front today is the prime minister\u2019s speech to the National Press Club in a few hours,\u201d said Turnbull, who has been out of the country for the past week of turmoil. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be laying out his agenda for the future and I think everyone will be tuned in to that so that\u2019s where we should be concentrating and that\u2019s certainly what I\u2019ll be paying attention to today.\u201d Bishop also said Abbott had her full support and said the prime minister would outline \u201ca strategic direction for us in the lead-up to the next election\u201d. In the address Abbott will axe his paid parental leave policy and commit to further changes to national security laws. Under the new structural arrangements, the full ministry will meet with cabinet once a month instead of quarterly. Ministers will also have to attend backbench policy committee meetings to ensure cabinet is more responsive to backbenchers. A backbench policy advisory group will be established to develop ideas. Morrison praised government backbenchers as \u201cdoing a great job\u201d and said Abbott\u2019s office and ministry changes were a sign he was listening. \u201cI think that\u2019s an honest reflection by the PM, and I think government members will welcome that,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis is an iterative process, and I think there has been significant iteration today. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that he has good processes that connect us to the ground, and ... the government members are critical for that process.\u201d The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, appeared to urge his Liberal colleagues not to change leaders. \u201cThe way you test the character of a government is its mechanisms, its capacity and its characters who forge through that,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cYou don\u2019t sink the ship as a mechanism to try to find a better place in the ocean to swim.\u201d The assistant treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said Abbott had the strong support of his colleagues and the Liberals were \u201ca lot better than the Labor party\u201d. \u201cThey would rotate leaders like a game of pass the parcel,\u201d said Frydenberg. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the prime ministership of Australia, not the leadership of a local branch. The Liberal party has never tossed a PM in their first term, ever since its foundation, and I don\u2019t think we should start now.\u201d Other MPs described Monday\u2019s speech in Canberra as a crucial moment for Abbott to demonstrate a way forward, amid doubts he could turn the government\u2019s fortunes around. It is understood he will nominate the families package alongside a \u201csmall-business and jobs package\u201d, \u201cfurther strengthening of national security laws\u201d, and changes to the operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
