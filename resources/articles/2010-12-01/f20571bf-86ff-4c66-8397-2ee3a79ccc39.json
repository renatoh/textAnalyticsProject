But we may have seen the conception of another. Many speakers set out the Liberal Democrat approach to higher education, expressing concerns about debt and unfairness, the marketisation of education and the withdrawal of the state from some subjects. Many of these speakers were Liberal Democrat MPs. But others were on the Labour benches, and it was John Denham who delivered the most sustained argument in favour of the position Liberal Democrats took at the last election. This should cause Liberal Democrats to sit up and think. Most of the party defines itself as being \"centre-left\", so how did the party end up so badly split on an issue which has previously united it? This split stems not just from a different approach to fees, but from a wider division between centre-left and centre-right liberals. Those on the right generally favour privatised and marketised policies. On the left, we really do take the view that we are all in it together. We seek democratic and localised policies and yes, we do generally favour higher spending and more redistribution. This dichotomy puts the Liberal Democrat leadership exceptionally close to the Conservative leadership. It should also make most Liberal Democrat members realise that we have more in common with members of the Labour party and the Greens than we do with our own leadership. Such commonalities are not new, but in the past, common ground with Labour leaders has been hard to find. With the election of Ed Miliband as Labour leader, that has changed. Ed Miliband is different because he is clearly on the centre-left, in the territory inhabited by social democrats and social liberals. Nobody can credibly imagine that the Labour party as a whole has suddenly altered. Much about it remains problematic, not least the authoritarian instincts of some of its members. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrats will rightly remain curious about Labour policy until the policy review reports. But values must come before policy details and Lib Dems should see the values the new leader has set out as an exciting opportunity. Ed Miliband articulates a vision of the good society which has been around in the Labour party for years, closely associated with Compass, and close to core social liberal values: rejecting marketisation, giving people power through stronger local democracy, and a deep concern for sustainability. Though not a new agenda, it is under Ed Miliband's leadership at the heart of the party for the first time. Aside from policy, a core element of this agenda is political pluralism. Many Liberal Democrats were initially worried about Ed Miliband on that score. However, since he became leader he has acted as a genuine pluralist. In the past week he has signed up for the Labour Campaign for the Alternative Vote. Given the current poll ratings for the Lib Dems it would be tempting for any Labour leader to duck the issue, knowing that old-style politics might well deliver a Labour victory next time. Ed Miliband has not gone down that route. Even more interesting was Ed Miliband's first conference speech as Labour leader. It was a significant moment when he said: \"Wisdom is not the preserve of any one party. Some of the political figures in history whom I admire most are Keynes, Lloyd George, Beveridge, who were not members of the Labour party.\" Contrast that with Nick Clegg's approach. While Vince Cable and Chris Huhne have cited Keynes as an influence, all we hear from Nick Clegg is lots about John Stuart Mill. Rarely, if ever, is there talk of the Liberals cited by Ed Miliband, nor the originators of social liberalism such as LT Hobhouse or TH Green. A philosophy which seldom goes beyond Mill is firmly stuck in the 1850s, as if more than a century of social liberalism never happened. Some Liberal Democrats have responded to the new Labour leader by joining the Labour party, and others may do in the future. But there is another way forward for those who believe in political pluralism. MPs, policymakers and activists should engage closely with like-minded people in Labour. That can easily happen in the congenial settings of thinktank events, as we have done for years. But it needs to be practical too, including MPs drawing up joint amendments to legislation so it has a chance of being passed. We should also be willing to engage in dialogue about our parties' policies for the next parliament. Engaging in this way has at least four benefits. First, it might improve legislation, making a difference to people's lives. Second, it may well influence the policy of the next government. After all, Lib Dems are always being sold the current coalition on the basis that it allows us to influence policy. Third, if two heads are better than one in life, as Nick Clegg told our last conference, then such dialogue may lead to solutions which neither Lib Dems nor Labour would have come up with acting separately. Fourth, it will mean that if after the next election there is the prospect of a Lib-Lab coalition, it can be based on an agenda which has been thrashed out in good time, rather than forced upon us in a few days through electoral chance. The current Liberal Democrat leaders will not always be our leaders. In time, the centre-left roots of the party should (or at least could) reassert themselves. The fees debate has shown that there is already a coalition of ideas across the Liberal Democrat and Labour benches. Meanwhile, we see a Labour leader who is inspired by our philosophical heritage and believes in pluralism. Why wouldn't we engage with him?
