I want to install an extractor fan, but do not want a large hood and chimney obscuring the view of the garden. Our DIY expert Julian Cassell says, \"Sadly, you cannot use a flush-mounted centrifugal fan above the cooker, because it will simply clog up in no time. These are designed for positioning across the room from the cooker, to help extract moisture. The hood design is the most efficient way of dealing with odours and grease. For something less obtrusive, try a downdraught extractor, which is fitted into the worktop along the back edge of the hob and extends up a few centimetres above it. Appliance City stocks the De Dietrich Downdraught extractor for \u00a31,399. Or go for a design that is recessed in the ceiling. Atag's Magna range, for example, is effective as long as the gap between worktop and hood is less than 2m. This will keep your garden view, but will cost around \u00a32,000 fitted.\" I splashed toothpaste on my Moroccan leather slippers and it left a dark mark. I bought some leather upholstery cleaner, but it left a light patch. \"Dab the mark with a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water,\" says our cleaning expert Stephanie Zia. \"If that doesn't work, make a paste of lemon juice and cream of tartar, apply to the stain, leave for a few hours, then wipe off with a damp cloth. You may have used the type of leather cleaner that lifts the dye as well as the dirt. Leather recolouring balm (\u00a312.99, from furnitureclinic.co.uk) restores the colour, but it only works if it can soak into the leather. Test with a drop of water on the mark and see if it soaks in. If the leather isn't absorbent, try Furniture Clinic's leather repair touch-up kit (\u00a320). \u2022 Got a question for our crack team of homes experts?
