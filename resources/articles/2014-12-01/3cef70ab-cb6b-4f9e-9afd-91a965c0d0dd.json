That would not be unusual except that Real Sociedad do not have a Stefano. They do, though, have Esteban Granero. And Granero admits that, yes, it was him that Moyes was calling to. The footage illustrated the added difficulty of taking over at a club in a new country, particularly with the season underway. It was a glimpse, too, of Granero\u2019s importance. Intelligent, analytical, a Real Madrid youth teamer and an English speaker who played in the Premier League, he understands the new manager both linguistically and conceptually. If it surprised that Moyes should get his name wrong, it was less surprising that he should reach out to him. \u201cIt is true that [Moyes and I] have had a few conversations. Over the first few days, I told him how we were doing, what had gone wrong. I\u2019ll help any way I can but my role is just to be a player,\u201d Granero says. \u201cMy brother lives in China and his wife is Chinese, so we speak English, and I always tried to learn, listening as often as I could. I\u2019m glad I did. It\u2019s embarrassing that people graduate from university in Spain without being able to speak English. We\u2019re the only country in Europe where they don\u2019t speak English.\u201d That helps to ease the settling in process while Moyes learns the language and about his players. Their names, even. \u201cOf course there are little things that make you laugh, but that in no way affects his authority. Moyes is the boss and we follow what he asks of us,\u201d Granero says. The question, then, is obvious: what has he asked of you? Granero leans forward on a sofa at the club\u2019s Zubieta training ground and explains, speaking softly, slowly and thoughtfully. One word gets repeated often: \u201cintensity\u201d. The morning session is a good example. It is a Tuesday and a Scottish voice carries across the pitch in the valley of the River Oria. It is derby week in the Basque Country and the pressure is on. After three games without conceding a goal, the club\u2019s first clean sheets this season, that sense of progress ended with a 4-0 defeat by Villarreal last Sunday. Seven days on, they face Athletic Bilbao. Communication complicates everything but this is Moyes doing what he does well: coach. There is energy and information, a flow of instructions, mostly shouted in English with occasional Spanish. There is demonstration too. A handful of fans gather round the pitch, some smoking, while la Real play six against six, three teams rotating; three touches, then two, then one. Specific drills follow, Moyes and his assistant, Billy McKinley, walking players through the details. \u201cIntense, very intense,\u201d Granero says. \u201cHe wants us to be more aggressive. [Moyes] will have to adapt to Spain but we\u2019re also adapting to him. In the Premier League, if you\u2019re not aggressive then you don\u2019t even get a touch of the ball and he has brought that. But [while] that desire to be more aggressive sounds very English, it\u2019s not that simple and it\u2019s not just about tackling; it\u2019s the way you approach the game. \u201cThat identity fits here. If he\u2019d gone to Andalucia it might have been harder. But Real Sociedad has a tradition of British coaches and the Basque country has parallels with the landscape, the weather, the mentality. Climate is a key factor.\u201d Granero has worked with Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, men he says are not as different as many think. He also dismisses the simplistic view of Harry Redknapp as a man who does little more than tell his players to run about a bit as a convenient lie: \u201cHarry doesn\u2019t reveal himself. He\u2019s more studious than people realise.\u201d Moyes, he says, is not out of place and Granero sees parallels with Mourinho\u2019s desire to impose physically. \u201cI talked to Juan Mata about Moyes \u2013 he spoke highly of him,\u201d Granero says. \u201cWe know what the big clubs are like. They\u2019re dangerous because there\u2019s a huge media spotlight and criticism comes easy. Juan told me the \u2018mister\u2019 was unlucky, he would have liked them to have a little bit more patience. But that is how things are ... and it\u2019s good for la Real that we have him now.\u201d For Granero especially. His past two seasons have been defined by relegation with QPR and injury, a torn knee ligament in September 2013 virtually ending the 2013-14 campaign, but he says he that he learned more than at any other time. He describes this as the most important year of his career. Moyes can restart la Real and restart Granero, too. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that this will be a great year. I\u2019m taking it very seriously. Moyes has motivated me a lot. I can learn from him. \u201cHe wants me to help control the game. He believes that with our ability, we should be having more possession. If you keep the ball the other team end up deeper and you reduce the danger and increase your threat. That\u2019s his battle. If he is angry it\u2019s because we have much more ability than we\u2019ve shown. \u201cWe are ready to learn, humble. We want to improve and we see Moyes as the key to that. From the first day, the very first drill, he\u2019s been very clear. And that\u2019s exactly what we needed. He\u2019s a prestigious coach and he wants a big club. We want that big club to be Real Sociedad. We\u2019re no smaller than Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. But if the chain slips off your bike at the very start of the stage, if you lose the peloton, then it\u2019s hard until you can get back into the pack and build momentum. We need to do that. \u201cThis is a club with a proud history and big fan base, over 22,000 season ticket holders. I don\u2019t think the teams near us in the table are thinking about Europe, but we are. The challenge is the Champions League. We\u2019re not afraid to say that. That has to be our [long-term] aim. That\u2019s the challenge, it\u2019s what we all want and what the coach came for.\u201d But la Real go into Sunday\u2019s Basque derby in 14th, 16 points off the Champions League places and three points away from the relegation zone. They need to start winning. For Moyes, it will be a unique experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a special game,\u201d Granero says. \u201cTwo rivals from the same autonomous region, a country within a country. It\u2019s healthier than a normal derby: fans mix, there\u2019s never any trouble. You really see the difference. It will be a nice game, especially if we win \u2026 and I am convinced that we will.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
