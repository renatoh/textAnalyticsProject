Do not read on if you haven't seen episodes five and six \u2013 and please do not post spoilers if you've seen further into the series. Catch up on the episodes three and four blog Twice tonight we saw Lund on the verge of tears: struggling to gather her composure; worried that her actions had resulted in the death of Emilie. It was a a rare glimpse beyond those steely defences that Lund usually maintains when it comes to her feelings. And that's before we even mention her steamy night with Borch \u2026 the jumper was off before you could say Faroe Islands. Lund falling for not-completely-trustworthy partners is nothing new, of course. And in fact there has been a great deal of repetition across these first six episodes, a fact that has not gone unnoticed in the comments. These episodes gave us: trust issues around Lund's partner; families dealing with death and funeral arrangements; a politician's possible involvement with the murder of a teenager; the squad under pressure for their handling of a case. I'd only seen the first two episodes of this series when I interviewed writer S\u00f8ren Sveistrup about it. He explained that he'd been careful not to repeat himself with the second series, but that this time round he felt freer when he approached the storyline. \"Generally I'm writing about my own nightmares. The Killing is always about something you can lose. You can of course lose your life, and you can also lose self-respect, ideas, and of course you can lose your family. You can lose everything that has a value for you. And that's just my own nightmare \u2013 just to wake up one day and discover it's all gone. It has to do with some personal experience I had many years back, and really I'm just re-writing my own neurosis with every episode.\" This week it felt like we were exploring the loss of a child \u2013 whether through death or estrangement \u2013 and the guilt that adults feel as a result. We had Kamper, Zeuthen and perhaps Lund all reflecting on whether things would have been different if they'd had more time for their children. Lund doubting herself over Emilie's death. Louise's foster dad blaming himself for her suicide. The investigation: what do we know \u2022 The kidnapper totally outsmarted the police when it came to handing over Emilie. He appeared to put Emilie in a duffel bag, shoot her, and throw her overboard with a concrete weight attached. \u2022 It's still not clear whether he in fact spared Emilie, although Brix is finally now in possession of a body thought to belong to the girl. \u2022 Louise Jelby went missing on a Thursday, not a Friday. This was changed in later reports. Importantly, the Zeeland sailors were still at sea on Thursday. \u2022 Spurred on by Lund's assertation that Zeeland had nothing to do with Jelby's death, the kidnapper stole a red van and headed to West Justland, and the place where she died. \u2022 Jelby was last seen on the main road, away from her usual route home, lifting her broken bike into the boot of an expensive black car. \u2022 Louise's dad is unknown: her late mother described him as \"sailing the seven seas like Pippi Longstocking's dad.\" \u2022 Lund and Borch now believe they have found the place the teenager was held, in a disused shipping building. The red van is out the back. \u2022 Unfortunately they are now locked into the crime scene. \u2022 The pair were arguing about Borch and the PET's part in the initial Jelby investigation, in which the involvement of a black car was covered up. \"Someone's car stood out \u2026\" said Borch. \u2022 The justice minister, Mogens Rank, did have a meeting with the deputy public prosecutor \u2013 but it only lasted half an hour. \u2022 Ussing, however, had a meeting with the prosecutor where he pressured the prosecutor over a dead girl in West Jutland, and something he didn't want to get out. The police Sarah Lund's bum! Let's get the increasingly inevitable Borch/Lund hookup \u2013 and its naked morning-after consequences \u2013 out the way first. It had been signposted enough, what with Borch heading to wherever Lund found herself at breakneck speed, him being the only person in the station to call her \"Sarah\", and the hilarious family moment in the car with Juncker in the back like their weird child, smirking and eating crisps. There are only a couple of problems: Maria and the girls; Borch not being straight with Lund over the Jelby case. Not only has the PET officer been back to tidy up afterwards, but he's spent the last couple of days trying to put Lund off the trail of the black car, even (especially) when it's been the obvious line of inquiry. I'm presuming that's because Borch has been doing his secret security job properly, rather than because he's actually tied up in the crime \u2013 not least because even Lund couldn't end up falling for the perpetrator twice in a row. But even so it feels slightly odd to return to the idea of Lund being attracted to a partner who's potentially a wrong'un. Elsewhere, Brix has found himself under pressure in the rush to find a scapegoat for Emilie's death \u2013 and a convenient one who has resisted cuts to the department at that \u2013 with Ruth Hedeby basically throwing him to the wolves. I liked that Brix, making fine use of his granite-carved features here, came out of this a somewhat unlikely hero: he knows responsibility for the case lies at his door, but also that when his superiors ducked the difficult decisions, he took them. In any case, I'm not sure anyone really bungled anything. Rather the kidnapper proved, once more, too smart for the police. The politicians It is a basic rule of Forbrydelsen that someone set up to look as guilty as justice minister Mogens Rank will not be the person you're looking for. So it was little surprise that it was not Rank putting pressure on the deputy public prosecutor but, in fact, Ussing \u2013 if only because the only other politician we have met is Rosa Lebech, who would presumably have been too indecisive to commit to a meeting with him. This is a problem for me with this series of The Killing. We're getting through the police plot so quickly that the political stuff is completely underdeveloped. We don't really know (or care about) any of the politicians yet, which makes their \"I'm resigning\"/\"I'm not resigning\"/\"My finance minister is trying to oust me\"/\"What are the centre party doing today?\"/\"I have such guilt about my son\" merry-go-round feel a little bit like hard work. It's where the slow burn of Forbrydelsen I really worked, and the political focus of series two really helped. Kamper, sadly, is no Thomas Buch or indeed TROELS! The family Sveistrup isn't making it easy for the actors playing Robert and Maja. Not only do the pair have to deal with the emotions of their divorce, meaning they can't rely on each other, there's also Robert's guilt at not saving his child as she was seemingly shot in front of them, and the slight glimmer of hope that Brix has handed Maja which is pushing the pair even further apart. It's unbelievably grim. Even in those moments where Robert manages to get them working together, the grief is still overwhelming. I'm so impressed with Anders W Berthelsen who plays Robert, and manages to convey all that emotion while remaining a largely buttoned-up character. The exchange between him and Rheinhart \u2013 who now looks a great deal less guilty \u2013 after Emilie's presumed death was the most moving moment of these two hours for me: formal, straight-backed and practical, it was charged with compassion and incomprehension. A great moment. All those beautifully composed shots of Zeuthen, entirely alone in his grief, are breaktaking. Also glassy-eyed was Lund, awkwardly standing about at the ultrasound with Mark's now abandoned girlfriend Eva. Whether she was weeping for Emilie, remembering her own pregnancy, or thinking about her relationship with her son now, I'm not sure. But it was a spellbinding moment. And while she's certainly not being the most receptive housemate Eva could have hoped for, the fact that she attended the scan \u2013 despite being seemingly miles away when Eva told her about it \u2013 is surely a sign that she's determined to be a better gran than she was mother. Notes and observations \u2022 I spent most of tonight shouting at them to check the kidnapper had actually shot Emilie. Did it not occur to anyone but Borch? Really? \u2022 Ruth Hedeby had a bit of a young Joan Collins about her appearance this episode. I presume from \"the two of us have \u2026 a past\" she and Brix are no more. \u2022 \"Last time I fell asleep in a car with you, I woke up in a layby in Norway with a stiff back.\" \"You didn't get a stiff back from sleeping in the car.\" What is this? Carry On Killing? \u2022 Some top-class furious smoking from Borch tonight, like cop shows of old. \u2022 What's going on with that Bill of Indictment stuff by the way? It appears to have been dropped altogether. \u2022 The ridiculously evil public prosecutor seemed to have stepped straight off a truck marked \"waxy-faced killers\". \u2022 Despite a rather grim exterior, Mogens' house provided a welcome moment of interiors lust \u2013 he's clearly been taking tips from Birgitte Nyborg. \u2022 I liked Borch's line about knowing how something was missing because he could feel it, \"a bit like when I've forgotten my keys.\" \u2022 Do you think the prime minister has had special dramatic lighting installed in his office for when he's questioning people? \u2022 This might be a complete red herring \u2013 but do we know who Mark's dad is? I'm presuming it's definitely not (an oblivious) Borch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
