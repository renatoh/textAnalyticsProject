A neo-classical chamber-pop outfit, they used a variety of instruments - oboes, clarinets, bassoons, cellos, violins - and wrote songs with baroque arrangements. Naming themselves after a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley and bearing long, flowing locks, the core duo - Caroline Crawley and Jemaur Tayle - were lampooned in the music press as the ultimate in preciousness and pretension. They were mocked as \"the Pre-Raphaelite Fruitcakes\". However, Geoff Travis, who was in the crowd at that Mary Chain gig, was bowled over by Shelleyan Orphan's intoxicatingly sad, richly orchestrated melodies. The Rough Trade boss, sensing that he needed a replacement for the Smiths, then on their way out, left excited messages on their answering machine, promising them the world. \"He absolutely loved us,\" says Tayle today. \"He said we could have anything we want.\" Travis gave them access to Abbey Road studios and a large budget. In return they gave him an album - 1987's Helleborine - so full of swirling esoterica that it was always going to struggle to find a mass audience. Nevertheless, anyone looking beyond the surface whimsy and flowery imagery could see Shelleyan Orphan had commercial potential. In Caroline Crawley they had not just a photogenic frontwoman but a singer whose voice had an uncanny purity and power, somewhere on the idiosyncratic female vocal range between Kate Bush and Liz Fraser. And their music, though ornate, was based around the sort of aching chord changes that Johnny Marr was penning and that the Sundays would later turn into a saleable commodity. The release of Shelleyan Orphan's second album, 1989's Century Flower, was delayed for a year because of problems between Rough Trade and the band's management. But Robert Smith of the Cure was sufficiently impressed by their now gorgeously streamlined sound to invite them on tour. \"That's when things started to move for us,\" says Crawley, who also admits they didn't capitalise on the exposure afforded by the opportunity. One further album, 1992's Humroot, followed, after which Crawley and Tayle went their separate ways. \"It felt like we stopped too soon,\" she admits. \"But then, we've always been slightly out on a limb.\" \"Both of us went into the healing arts,\" explains Crawley, whose chosen field was \"Hawaiian healing body work and singing therapy\". She travelled to India, the Himalayas and Australia where she stayed with Aborigines as a way of working through unhappy childhood memories. \"Our first manager said he either saw mischief in my face, or sadness,\" she says. \"I've always had a sense of longing. I've had moments of joy, but there's a dissatisfaction on some deep level that I've lived with for most of my life.\" Tayle immersed himself in the study of Chinese medicine and holistic therapies, which he proceeded to mete out to the great and the good. \"I massaged Johnny Depp three times,\" he laughs, \"but the most surreal one was Thom Yorke. When Radiohead and REM played Glastonbury, I had Thom in my spa pool with the rest of Radiohead and REM sat around watching. It was a strange day.\" On their first album for 16 years, We Have Everything We Need, the reformed Shelleyan Orphan sound as exquisitely out-of-time as ever, only now they're not hiding behind allegories and conceits, they're being more directly emotional. \"We always found it difficult writing about ourselves,\" says Tayle, while Crawley recalls how during recording of the plaintive I May Never, she burst into tears during one take, while during the second one the studio engineer did exactly the same. \"People are starting to say we were ahead of our time,\" she says. \"Hopefully that will help us be accepted.\" Just don't believe the hype, they add. \"People expecting us to be walking around with poetry books under our arms and being intellectual are going to be disappointed,\" says Tayle, who left school at 16. \"We were never trying to be clever, different or weird - that's just what we did.\" \u00b7 We Have Everything We Need is released by One Little Indian on October 13"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
