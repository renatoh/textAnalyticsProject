McKenzie, a fast-rising star, has been celebrated for her paintings of sporting icons and symbols but, such is the measure of the young artist's success, she already feels the need to move on. But this isn't a show about McKenzie and her development: it's about friendship, by two artists who met on an exchange trip between their two art colleges. While there are some glorious new paintings by Olowska - enigmatic female beauties in 1950s fashion - and recent work by McKenzie on themes of heritage and commerce, the collaborative projects are the most engaging. A massive wall painting, Loved By Women Loved By Toulous Lautreca, borrows from Soviet propaganda posters and feminises the iconography; a video travelogue shows the pair in Poland, on dance floors and in art galleries, just hanging out together. Watching this, in a room surrounded by others full of their work, the show's whole point - to reveal affinities, experiences and contexts within which art is produced - hits home. The same point is unmissable in a room containing work owned by friends and families - art the two women grew up with. It's the artistic equivalent of showing the working out of a mathematical puzzle and neatly defeats all our expectations. Throughout, there's an emphasis on contradicting the conventional view of the artist as a genius working in isolation. The layering of references, the revelation of allusion and borrowing, is almost suffocating at times. There are images or text sent between the two women, scenes and typography from high and low culture, and namechecks for Armani, Hockney, Pollock and Glasgow artist Jim Lambie. Olowska shows architectural models she found lying around in Gdansk poly; McKenzie's work is saturated with references to money and brand identities and the role they play in national cultural identity. This means a wall of paintings in the shape of bank notes, some splendid Charles Rennie Mackintosh-influenced curtains and a wrought iron panel, its pattern including a map of Scotland and pound signs. There are, inevitably, some private jokes and (though this is deliberate) it can be hard to work out which work is by which artist. But this is a thrilling exhibition that makes you want to keep an eye on both artists. \u0095 Until May 27. Details: 0131-248 2983."}, "isHosted": false}}}
