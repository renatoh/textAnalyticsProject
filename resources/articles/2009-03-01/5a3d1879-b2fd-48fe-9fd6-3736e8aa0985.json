The Ghanaian had launched himself furiously at the visiting player at the final whistle, stewards stepping in to separate the pair, with the home manager, Roy Hodgson, later revealing that his full-back had complained to the referee during the game about being \"abused\". \"The referee told me he was very upset, that he felt he'd been abused, but that he hadn't heard anything himself so he couldn't take any action,\" said Hodgson at the time. The manager had added that if Pantsil felt the issue should be taken further, the club would \"explore\" the possibility of seeking retrospective action. Yet, once tempers had calmed, the full-back is understood to have indicated today that he would rather let the matter drop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
