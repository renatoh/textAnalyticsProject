Traditionally the small fish of the media industry, indies are stepping up growth plans following a BBC announcement in May that it would open up an extra quarter of its programming to independents - a pool worth more than \u00a3300 million. At present 25 per cent of BBC output is produced by independents, dominated by major players such as Hat Trick for comedy and Mentorn for current affairs. The last three months has seen a flurry of stock market flotations and consolidations as producers try to strengthen their position in the race for BBC commissions. Shed Productions, maker of Bad Girls and Footballers' Wives, floated on Aim in March worth \u00a344 million. The move has paid off; this week Shed was commissioned to produce its first programme for the BBC, a drama called Waterloo Road. Shed's listing was closely followed by RDF Media in April, the company behind Wife Swap and Faking It. RDF is worth more than \u00a350 million. A minority stake in Big Brother producer, Endemol, will also be available within a year. Telef\u00f3nica, the Spanish firm that bought the company five years ago, is expected to announce the date of its flotation soon. Worldwide, Endemol is worth at least \u20ac1 billion (\u00a3669m). Richard Constant, the spokesperson for All3Media, which produces the hit daytime talk show Richard and Judy, says that he has been fighting off claims that the company is considering a \u00a3150 million flotation early next year. In the short term at least, All3Media will focus on integrating new acquisitions such as Lion TV and Company Pictures, both bought in 2004. They are also in talks with Mersey TV, producer of Hollyoaks There are more than 600 independent television producers in the UK, with a total turnover of about \u00a31 billion. Historically, most have survived from commission to commission, relying on the tastes of fickle audiences to determine their fate. 'Independent TV production is best described as a cottage industry. The sector is very fragmented and there is no guarantee of commissions,' says Patrick Yau, a media analyst for Bridgewell Securities. Volatile revenue streams make independent television producers a bad bet for investors. With few companies large enough to move to the stock market, Yau expects Endemol to be the only indie to float before 2007. The Communications Act passed last year brought the first sign of financial stability and may be the reason behind the current boom. The act allows producers to maintain rights over their programmes after they are broadcast. 'Owning rights gives companies assets on which to base future commissions,' says Lucas Church, joint managing director of Endemol UK. The broadcaster's share of the revenue when a programme produced by an independent is sold elsewhere has fallen from about 70 per cent to only 15 per cent. Outside sales and spin-offs, such as DVDs and books, offer a guaranteed income between commissions. Shed's recent sale of Footballers' Wives to 20 countries, including the US, proves that this revenue source is ripe for exploitation. 'The changes in the terms of trade mean that companies can run as businesses for the first time. The effects have not been felt dramatically yet, but they will be in the future,' says Church. The horizontal growth of super-indies, however, leaves smaller producers in an even stickier situation. In an industry where size counts for everything, the top ten super-indies, including Endemol and All3Media, produced half the total output of the independent sector in 2004. 'To run a channel like the BBC it makes sense to have solid relationships with big, recognised producers. They can make many more hours of programmes at a lower cost. But I also think it is important for the major broadcasters to nurture minor producers,' says Ron McCulloch from Insight News TV, a small producer that makes factual documentaries about the developing world. A shortage of commissions has already forced two of his competitors to quit the industry altogether. Smaller production companies end up running tight margins and hiring staff on low pay and short contracts. A recent Guardian campaign highlighted the exploitation of employees in independents, describing how young workers are expected to put in long hours for little reward. An Ofcom review of the television production sector to be completed early next year will address issues such as these. Until then, super-indies continue to excite the markets and dominate the screens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
