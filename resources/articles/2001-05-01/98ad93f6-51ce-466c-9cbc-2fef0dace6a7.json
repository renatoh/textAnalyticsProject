The National Association of Pension Funds has written to the Treasury calling for independent academic research to be carried out on fees charged by stock brokers to pension funds - which the Myners report said should be disclosed by pension fund managers. It has volunteered to work with the Treasury on drawing up ways to measure the success of the so-called Myners principles in two years. The NAPF, whose members control 20% of the stock market, is also concerned about the implications of paying pension fund trustees and the costs smaller pension funds might face if they are required to provide them with extensive support facilities. The concerns raised by NAPF about the practicalities of the Myners report come as the consultation period into its \"principles\" ends tomorrow. The chancellor initiated the consultation after the Budget when he supported the findings of the report he commissioned last year to discover whether pension funds were too \"short-termist\" when investing their assets. It was conducted by Paul Myners, the chairman of Gartmore, the fund management group, and of Guardian Media Group. It was the most extensive investigation to date into the behaviour of large institutional investors. The NAPF's members are the most likely to feel the impact of any regulatory changes, and even though the association is concerned about the long-term implications of some of the suggestions, it is broadly supportive of the ideas raised. However, it has written to the Treasury with proposals to be make the Myners report \"more workable\" in practice. Peter Thompson, incoming NAPF chairman, said that the association had raised three main points with the Treasury on the Myners principles - the payment of trustees, the principle on effective decision-making and the cost of the commission and execution of transactions. In a separate letter to the Department of Social Security, NAPF supports the Myners review proposal for greater clarity on pension fund surpluses that will encourage employers to maintain defined pension schemes, for which the payouts during retirement are known. Such policies have started to be phased out. Mr Thompson said the idea of paying pension fund trustees was \"unnecessary and undeliverable\". The Treasury declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
