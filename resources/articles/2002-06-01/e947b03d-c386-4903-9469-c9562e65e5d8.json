Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson believes that England are disadvantaged by their long domestic season, and the FA chief executive, Adam Crozier, says it is in every one's interests to have players peaking in spring rather than suffering from injuries. 'I honestly don't believe this is a club v country issue,' said Crozier. 'It's about players, and we all know the top players play a lot of games if you count up the cups and the maximum of 17 games they could play in the Champions League. 'We are not saying we've got the answer, but we need to ask players and coaches what they think is appropriate. It's not as simple as just cutting down fixtures, because a lot of clubs aren't playing too many games, and David Beckham has just claimed he would be happy to play football every day of the week. We just want to try and make this work for everyone.' One the eve of England's opening game in Japan, Crozier also took the opportunity to reinforce his support for Eriksson. 'The players are all incredibly positive about him,' Crozier said. 'The expression they use is \"total respect\". I am very happy at the way things have turned out. He has made it clear he is not going anywhere after the World Cup, and even if England should lose all three games, he would still have my backing.' Fans sent home Two more England supporters with a history of hooliganism were turned back at the airport while trying to enter Japan yesterday. A 40-year-old on a flight from London and a 36-year-old flying in from Seoul, South Korea, were put on planes back home after being detained at Tokyo's Narita Airport, the National Police Agency said. The British Embassy added that 20 England supporters from Britain have now been refused entry. Of those, Japanese police confirmed eight were turned away because their names were on a list of convicted soccer hooligans provided by European authorities. The British Embassy say 8,000 English fans are expected in Japan. Spain on alert The Spain manager Jos\u00e9 Camacho issued a warning to his team not to become the victims of another World Cup shock. Camacho, who put his multi-talented squad through a gentle work-out at the Gwangiu stadium before their clash with Slovenia today, said: 'We must make sure we do not get caught out like France were. Senegal showed what a supposed lesser nation can do to a potential favourite. 'Slovenia have some fine players who perform in Germany, Belgium and England, so that shows their experience and qualities.' Slovenia striker Zlatko Zahovic admitted his side were keen to make amends for their narrow 2-1 defeat by Spain at Euro 2000. 'The way you start is always important in big tournaments like the World Cup,' he said. 'I thought we were unlucky against them in Euro 2000 and this game gives us a chance to put that right.' Brazil learn lesson Brazil,who face three first-round opponents all rated as relatively easy, have also said that they are determined to avoid France's fate. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who has often alerted his players to the dangers of underestimating the opposition, repeated his warning and said his team could also fall victims to a zebra - as shock results are known in Brazil - if they do not take their rivals seriously. 'All the favourites are going to come up against the same difficulties as France,' he said. 'This should be an alert for Brazil. If you don't play seriously, you won't get anywhere.' Brazil, who face Turkey in their opening group C game tomorrow, are favourites to top a group that also includes Costa Rica and China."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
