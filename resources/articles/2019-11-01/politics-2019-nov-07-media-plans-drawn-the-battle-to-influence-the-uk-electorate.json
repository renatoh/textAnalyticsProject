According to political advisers, declining print newspaper circulations, falling audiences for broadcast television bulletins, and a febrile online environment may lead to a focus on divisive \u201cculture war\u201d issues forcing the public to pick a side. This is likely to come amid a cacophony of news that has little to do with what the parties see as the main topics of the day. Here\u2019s how that might play out. Television news Although television news has been almost completely abandoned by younger viewers, evening bulletins on BBC and ITV remain an easy way to reach millions of older viewers. Meanwhile live interviews provide raw material for viral clips \u2013 which brings its own problems for political campaigners. Television journalists are increasingly on the hunt for a \u201cviral moment\u201d. The audience for a short clip of a single embarrassing slip-up is likely to be substantially larger than the numbers tuning in to a TV interview. Reflecting a widespread concern among political strategists, Robbie Gibb, Theresa May\u2019s former director of communications, this week suggested reporters were now driven to seek \u201ccar crash\u201d interviews, as they are judged by whether their interviews go viral. For instance, Jo Swinson\u2019s inability to justify the Liberal Democrats\u2019 infamously misleading election graphs on Sky News was seen by millions of people online after it was redistributed on Twitter and Facebook, many more than would have seen the original interview when it was broadcast on TV. According to one Labour adviser, the easiest way to minimise potential damage is to minimise the number of lengthy interviews which could produce gaffes. A similar attitude is also being taken with the televised leaders debates \u2013 with both Labour and the Conservatives keen to ensure Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn only appear in head-to-head contests, to the exclusion of smaller parties. Radio While Westminster obsessives follow minute-by-minute coverage on the intricacies of parliamentary procedure, both Labour and the Conservatives have made clear they are less concerned about the Radio 4\u2019s Today programme and more interested in reaching wider audiences, such as brief news updates on music radio stations such as Radio 2, Heart or Classic FM. This format requires news stories to be summed up in two- or three-sentence snippets for people who may not be consuming much other news \u2013 removing nuance and rewarding parties with clear, sharp messages. Radio and television stations are subject to strict broadcasting impartiality rules during the election, which Labour believe helped them enormously during the last general election by restricting the ability of the Conservatives to set the agenda. The BBC is already steeled for complaints and to be used as a punch bag during this campaign, with the head of news, Fran Unsworth, pre-emptively urging the public to understand that giving a platform to a politician is not the same as endorsing them. Newspapers Print newspaper sales have halved in the UK since 2010 \u2013 when the Conservatives came to power with the full-bloodied backing of the nation\u2019s right-wing press. But campaigners from both major parties believe the front pages still matter. This is often because of the influence that newspapers with relatively small print circulations have on the BBC, with the national broadcaster\u2019s coverage often following talking points set by the front pages. At the same time British online news consumption has realigned itself around a small handful of well visited news websites and apps. Far out in front is BBC News Online, which reaches around half the population every week while striving for an impartial format that often repeats claims in \u201cquote format\u201d. Second place goes to MailOnline, a key target for politicians trying to reach general audiences and one that has increasingly run anti-Labour headlines. The Guardian is in third place, according to surveys by the Reuters Institute. Many other news sites are left scrabbling for readers, making them easier for campaigns to ignore. Political articles at the online version of established newspapers can attract only a few thousand readers \u2013 unless they have a sufficiently inflammatory headline that makes them go viral or are picked up by aggregator sites. Passive media consumption The challenge for politicians is that much online news consumption is passive \u2013 driven by an activist sharing an article on Twitter, a celebrity uploading something to Instagram, or a story being posted in a neighbourhood Facebook group. Recent research carried out for Ofcom found the public increasingly consume their news by scanning dozens of headlines on smartphones through social media feeds, rarely clicking on links, and only occasionally reading and watching articles or videos to the end. This passive way of obtaining information means the instant emotional impact of an amusing meme or a shocking headline is likely to spread far wider and faster than any policy-heavy political speech \u2013 which helps explains the potency of an image of Jacob Rees-Mogg reclining on a bench in the House of Commons. This is harder for centralised political media units to control, forcing a change in how they operate. One serving Labour political adviser pointed out that just as the editorial whims of the Sun could dictate the political policy of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour, so the whims of Facebook\u2019s newsfeed algorithm inevitably shapes some of the policies chosen by Corbyn\u2019s Labour. New forms of social media Since the last UK election there has been a massive uptick in the use of WhatsApp groups as a news source. This form of communication is hard for political parties to influence directly, while also allowing disinformation to flourish. Viral news sites The online playing field has also been levelled since 2017. During that snap election a raft of pro-Corbyn websites such as the Canary and Another Angry Voice dominated online debate but they have seen their audiences reduced by changes to Facebook\u2019s algorithm. In the same period many pro-Brexit campaign groups have built up substantial audiences on Facebook. The site is increasingly seen by campaign groups as a way of reaching older, less-engaged voters, with younger voters more likely to use Instagram. At the same time the new Johnson-led government has hired a series of 20-something advisers with intimate knowledge of right-wing blogs and experience of making messages go viral in a world where the battle is to grab attention at all costs. The Times claimed that Downing Street had polled views on issues such as transgender rights \u201cto see whether they can be weaponised against Labour in northern working-class constituencies\u201d. Online political advertising The other, completely distinct, strand of online campaigning is the promotion of paid-for political ads \u2013 largely the preserve of Facebook and Instagram\u2019s combined advertising platform, which attracted \u00a33m of spending in the last election. Tory HQ election planning has been left to Isaac Levido, a protege of long-term Tory adviser Sir Lynton Crosby, who insiders say has inherited a rusty campaign operation from the May era. Levido recently helped to run the successful election campaign for the right-wing coalition in Australia, aided by a relentless focus on message discipline and fake claims about tax rises spread widely on Facebook. Sam Jeffers of transparency group WhoTargetsMe, who is encouraging people to sign up to his service and help his outfit track political Facebook adverts, said the best approach for political parties \u201cis not micro-targeting \u2013 it\u2019s effective messaging, well optimised and repeated ad infinitum\u201d. When Facebook finally released data on Vote Leave\u2019s controversial 2016 campaign it showed that rather than running tens of thousands of micro-targeted adverts as speculated, the successful pro-Brexit campaign spent millions of pounds to promote a relatively small number of core messages on immigration and NHS funding. Craig Elder, who helped pioneer Facebook ad campaigns for the Conservatives in the 2015 general election, said: \u201cIt\u2019s never quite as sophisticated as people think it is. It comes down to the principles of good old-fashioned advertising. When we start to get into the idea of \u2018shadowy mind control with a million data points\u2019 we\u2019re either talking an aspiration or unbelievable bollocks.\u201d He said that Facebook had cracked down on parties using external data sources since the 2017 general election. Instead, the real question was how much parties were willing to commit to online advertising, with hard cash often being the main difference in terms of audience reach. \u201cIt\u2019s more sexy to write about astrophysics and micro-targeting,\u201d he said. \u201cIn reality it\u2019s not much more sophisticated than a Colgate ad \u2013 you need a really great message that connects with people and you need to pay to get it in front of as many people as you can.\u201d However, he insisted no advertising can counteract widespread negative coverage: \u201cIf a major figure from outside politics \u2013 a Stormzy, for example \u2013 is using their huge online reach to speak with an authentic voice and mobilise their followers against you, then that can be worth as much or more than great ads, good targeting and a really big budget. Parties also have to accept that almost all of that will be happening completely outside their control, and it adds a huge degree of unpredictability to the online battle.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2019 to remove a reference to Sean Topham and Ben Guerin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
