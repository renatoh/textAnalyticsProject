The red planet is by no means at its brightest but will still be visible as a moderately bright object in the morning sky for the next few months. And it will always display a distinctive red hue to its light. From London, UK, Mars rises a few hours before dawn. The chart shows the view looking south-east at 0600 GMT on 18 February. From Sydney, Australia, Mars is much easier to spot. It is higher up in the eastern sky and forms a dramatic line pointing almost straight down with the crescent moon at the top, and Jupiter and Saturn underneath it. The alignment forms a spectacular parade of morning planets to look out for. If you are in North America, you could be in line for an even bigger treat. The moon will pass in front of Mars, blocking it from view, in the pre-dawn hours on the morning of 18 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
