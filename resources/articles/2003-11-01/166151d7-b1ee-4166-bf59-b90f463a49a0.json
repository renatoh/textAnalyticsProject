The company has already started removing the images from the front of machines in Scottish schools as part of a trial. It comes amid mounting pressure on food and drink manufacturers who have been blamed for contributing to increasing rates of obesity, especially in children. Coca-Cola owns and operates a large number of vending machines, many of which feature photographs of its fizzy drinks on the front panel. The company said it was looking at the results of the Scottish trial, which began last year, before deciding whether to do the same in schools south of the border. \"We don't sell our products through vending machines in primary schools but we do in secondary schools,\" said a spokesman, who said the company needed to look at the \"transition to non-branded fascia vending machines\" in Scotland to see if it should do it elsewhere. Coca-Cola has also extended a ban on advertising to the under-12s. The global giant says it has always avoided promotions of its fizzy drinks to younger children but has now changed this to include non-fizzy brands, such as Oasis. Food giant Heinz also made a pledge today not to target any advertising for its products solely at pre-school children. But it said the promise did not extend to using methods which might appeal to pre-school children, such as displaying characters from popular children's TV programmes on packaging. Heinz also promised not to carry out promotions in schools unless they had an educational benefit. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"These welcome moves by Coca-Cola and Heinz are positive steps in the right direction. I call on the government to introduce regulations which ensure that all other food companies do the same. \"The NUT is committed to protect children and is concerned that schools are increasingly under pressure to act as agents for food companies in ways that are potentially damaging to children's health.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
