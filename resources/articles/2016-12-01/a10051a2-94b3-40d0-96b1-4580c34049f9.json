The Mexican-American faces Anthony Joshua in Manchester on Saturday with the odds well and truly stacked against him becoming the first fighter to defeat the British heavyweight and take his IBF world title. Yet from the challenger himself comes the insistence that he can deliver a shock. Molina may not be the fastest, toughest or meanest heavyweight out there but, as Deontay Wilder discovered when the pair met last year, he can punch, and hard. The 34-year-old said: \u201cI have a vision in my mind as to where he [Joshua] makes mistakes and I have a vision as to where I am very, very dangerous. In my mind those fit together so well. They fit together in a way that makes it very realistic for him to get knocked out. I can knock anybody out.\u201d Molina rocked Wilder with a thudding left hook in the third round of their contest, and for a time it appeared as if the WBC champion was heading for an almighty fall \u2013 a first defeat and the loss of his crown in his home state of Alabama. Wilder recovered to win, dropping Molina three times en route to a ninth-round stoppage, but that early blow caught the attention and for Molina proved his reputation for being a heavy puncher is enough to spook the most formidable of fighters \u2013 including Joshua. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Wilder just go wild on me and knock me out, like he did with every\u2013one else?\u201d Molina asked before what is his first bout on British shores. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just do that? There\u2019s something that made him feel he could not do that. I hope this young champion does not come into this fight and make the mistake of thinking he\u2019s going to run over me, because it ain\u2019t gonna happen.\u201d Joshua has been typically respectful in the buildup to what is the second defence of the title he won with a second\u2011round stoppage of Charles Martin eight months ago \u2013 bar his early vow to make Molina \u201clook like shit\u201d \u2013 and his decision to include Robert McCracken, the Great Britain Olympic team coach, as part of his team for this fight suggests he is taking his opponent seriously. For sure, Molina deserves respect. After all, he has won 25 of his 28 contests, 19 by knockout. In his most recent fight he also stopped the Polish former two-division world champion Tomasz Adamek in Krakow. \u201cThat was the pinnacle of my career because it set me up for this fight,\u201d Molina said. \u201cYou think they flew me out to Poland because they thought I was going to win? No. They flew me out there because they thought I was going to lose and had no chance to knock him out. Bam, that happens.\u201d Molina\u2019s backstory \u2013 he worked as a special-needs teacher in his home state of Texas up until May and has vowed to eventually return to the job \u2013 adds a layer of intrigue to this fight, but despite that and the challenger\u2019s bold claims, Joshua should make it 18 successive victories via a stoppage with minimum fuss. Should that happen, there is unlikely to be much bitterness from his opponent, who was a late call-up by Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, for the injured Wladimir Klitschko. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man, a good champion and I like the things he represents,\u201d Molina said of the 2012 Olympic gold medallist. \u201cI say the same things about Wilder \u2013 he\u2019s a great friend of mine. I like the way he represents himself. These are guys we need to build the sport of boxing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
