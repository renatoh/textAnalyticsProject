Women hold 20 of the Liberal party\u2019s 68 seats across both houses of parliament, a number which could drop to six at the next election, given how many of those seats in the lower house are marginal. The Liberal party and its Coalition partner, the Nationals, which counts just two women MPs in its ranks, have struggled in recent months to deal with what MPs have termed \u201cthe women problem\u201d, following a series of sex scandals, allegations of harassment and women losing preselection to men. But Sarah Henderson, backed by Linda Reynolds in an editorial, have both told the Australian the Liberal party can be proud of its record on women, claiming it has done more than the Labor party to advance gender parity. That claim was ridiculed by Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, who pointed out Labor had twice as many women in parliament as the Liberals. Henderson, a Victorian MP who holds the Coalition\u2019s most marginal seat, Corangamite, by just 0.03%, said she did not experience any bullying or intimidation during the August leadership spill, despite several of her colleagues having reported harassment, and the party establishing an independent complaints process in the wake of the reports. \u201cIn my view, being lobbied for votes does not constitute bullying,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cI can\u2019t walk in anyone else\u2019s shoes, I can only speak about my experience. But I can certainly say that being lobbied for votes is an integral part of a political process and it does not constitute bullying.\u201d Henderson\u2019s comments came just days after her former Liberal colleague Julia Banks gave an interview to the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly, where she once again spoke of the bullying and intimidation she said MPs were subjected to during the leadership spill. In her editorial, Reynolds repeated the argument she made several times last year; that a quota system, like the one Labor instigated, which has led to almost 50% women representation, did not help create cultural change. Reynolds said without the quota, she believed the number of women in Labor ranks would revert to what they once were, as nothing had been done to encourage a natural cultural shift within the party\u2019s core. \u201cQuotas in and of themselves are a quick fix, but they do not change the structural and cultural barriers in an organisation. In the absence of other organisational transformations, when quotas are removed the changes do not stick,\u201d she wrote. Plibersek said those justifications were laughable. \u201cLabor has more than double the number of women the Liberals have in the parliament and about the twice the number of women on our front bench,\u201d she said. \u201cThat speaks for itself. \u201cOver the last five years, all Scott Morrison and the Liberals have done is deliver policies that disadvantage women. The Liberals tried five times to slash paid parental leave, and called working mums \u2018rorters\u2019 and \u2018double dippers\u2019. \u201cThe Liberals argued against increases to the minimum wage that substantially benefit women \u2026 and they also tried to cut around $35m from Community Legal Centres that provide crucial legal services to family violence victims.\u201d In September, several Liberal women MPs wore red on the same day, in a sartorial protest against the treatment of women, inspired by the red shoes Julie Bishop wore as she announced her resignation from the front bench, following Scott Morrison\u2019s ascent to the prime minister\u2019s suite. Henderson pointed to the women\u2019s economic statement, reinstated as part of the budget by Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, who, in a meeting with Morrison and Victorian MPs following the November state election, reportedly said the Liberal party was viewed as \u201chomophobic, anti-women, climate change deniers\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer has not disputed the reports, but, pressed in question time that same month, said she believed the Coalition to be \u201cthe natural government for Australian women\u201d. Privately, O\u2019Dwyer had lobbied for an independent complaints review process to be established within the Liberal party\u2019s federal and state executives to deal with the issue, which Morrison, attempting to stem the damaging ongoing flow of allegations, agreed to in September, the same day as the red sartorial protest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
