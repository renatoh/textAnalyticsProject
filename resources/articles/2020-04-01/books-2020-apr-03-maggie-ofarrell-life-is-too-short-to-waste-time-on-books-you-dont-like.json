I picked it not knowing anything about her \u2013 that fabulous title was enough \u2013 and I was swept away by the energy and immediacy of the stories. She has all the verve and daring of the best of Junot D\u00edaz, with the insight of Edith Pearlman. I\u2019m slowing down because I don\u2019t want the book to end. The book that changed my life Angela Carter\u2019s The Bloody Chamber. It was one of the first books I read after I finished my degree. Having spent three years immersed in classics, I was dumbfounded by Carter\u2019s irreverence and inventiveness. It made me want to have a stab at prose; up until that point I\u2019d only written poetry. Quite bad poetry. The book I wish I\u2019d written I\u2019m not sure I wish I\u2019d written it \u2013 because how on earth could I possibly have done so? \u2013 but I wholeheartedly admire and adore Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb. If I could only save one book from a supernatural conflagration of all books ever written, it would be this one. The book that influenced my writing The economy and particularity of Albert Camus\u2019s The Outsider set against the generous scope and unsettling omniscience of George Eliot\u2019s Daniel Deronda. The book that is most underrated Amy Bloom is well known for her novels \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 but I have been in love with her short stories for years. The economy and pacing she employs while describing the entire lifespan of a character fascinates me, as does her understanding of the tension between our interiors and exteriors. I am always urging people to read them. The book that changed my mind Germaine Greer\u2019s Shakespeare\u2019s Wife is a rigorously researched and deftly argued examination of the life of Anne Hathaway. It made me fully aware of the obloquy that has been inexplicably heaped upon her for centuries, by scholars and popular culture alike. I read it when I was beginning to write Hamnet and it made me want to give Anne Hathaway a voice and narrative of her own. The last book that made me cry I cannot get enough of Mary Oliver\u2019s poems but they often make me a bit tearful so I try not to read them in public. My favourite is probably \u201cGreen, Green Is My Sister\u2019s House\u201d; the line \u201cIt is impossible not / to remember wild and want it back\u201d gets me every time. The last book that made me laugh My daughters and I have been reading Katherine Rundell\u2019s Rooftoppers together, which is a firm favourite in our house. The relationship between Sophie and her ward, the absent-minded but affectionately liberal Charles, always makes us laugh. We particularly love it when he comes up against the dull and tedious child services woman, who believes that girls should wear dresses and always brush their hair. Hilarious notions. The book that I couldn\u2019t finish I confess to making heavy weather of Henry James. I have, more times than I care to admit, made an optimistic start on The Bostonians before swerving away to read something else. Maybe this is the year I\u2019ll make it to the end. The book I\u2019m most ashamed not to have read There should be no shame attached to reading, only pleasure. If you\u2019re not enjoying a book, I tell my children, put it down and try a different one. Life is too short and libraries too large to waste time on books you don\u2019t like. The book I give as a gift The one I\u2019ve probably wrapped up most often is Life After Birth by the brilliant Kate Figes. It\u2019s a collection of essays about early motherhood, and I give it to friends who have just had a baby. It\u2019s part insight, part research, part memoir: a mix that Figes pulled off like no other. I remember reading it during night feeds in the first few weeks of my son\u2019s life and it instantly made me feel less alone. I am now deep into her book about the other end of parenting, The Terrible Teens, which is mystifyingly out of print. Someone, somewhere, please reissue it. The book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for The many books I\u2019ve read to my children. There are books encountered at an early age that infiltrate your being, and they return to you throughout your life, along with the voices that read them to you. I suppose I\u2019d like my offspring, in their distant adulthood, to occasionally recall that specific comfort and thrill of a good bedtime story. My earliest reading memory I was listening to my parents\u2019 copy of the Beatles\u2019 Sgt Pepper with the sleeve lyrics open. The track \u201cFixing a Hole\u201d began to play and I realised that I could see and comprehend the words in front of me because they matched what Paul McCartney was singing. It was an extraordinary, explosive epiphany for me. My comfort read Molly Keane\u2019s Good Behaviour and Loving and Giving. She is devastatingly good at dialogue and setting and plot: these two of hers, in particular, are perfect. \u2022 Hamnet by Maggie O\u2019Farrell is published by Tinder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
