Time for a celebration: dinner with your colleagues, a few bottles of decent wine. Don't worry, says the boss, this one's on the company. And then the bill comes to ... \u00a344,007. At that point it's probably useless to try saying, \"But I didn't have a starter,\" while edging towards the door and mumbling about getting the last tube home. Best to sit tight and hope the boss's credit card limit can take the strain, and start to enjoy your place in history as part of the world's most expensive restaurant bill. If you find yourself nodding in agreement with the paragraphs above, then you are one of the six men who together blew \u00a344,000 on wine last Thursday at P\u00e9trus, the Michelin-starred central London restaurant run by Gordon Ramsay. \"They didn't bat an eyelid when they got the bill,\" said Ramsay in the wake of the night out that saw the six men - aged between 35 and 45 - get through three bottles of Chateau P\u00e9trus vintage claret worth a combined \u00a333,300. Yes, you read that correctly: three bottles worth an average of \u00a311,100 each. A bottle of the 1945 vintage cost \u00a311,600, followed by a bottle of the 1946 for \u00a39,400 (of course, '46 was such a poor year), and then a move upmarket to the more highly esteemed '47, a snip at \u00a312,300 - \"a big, powerful wine,\" according to an expert at Sotheby's wine department, with a strong, lingering finish on the wallet. A 1900 Chateau d'Yquem dessert wine costing \u00a39,200 and a 1982 bottle of Montrachet at a mere \u00a31,400 rounded off the meal, with Ramsay letting the diners off paying for the actual food consumed - a mere \u00a3300 in total. The whole bill worked out at \u00a37,300 a head, beating the previous best of \u00a34,360 per person consumed at Le Gavroche restaurant in London in 1997, according to the Guinness Book of Records. Ramsay is remaining quiet about who his connoisseur customers were, or where they came from, apart from describing them as \"City gentlemen\" - a description that probably rules out most people who make big money in the Square Mile. Since Friday afternoon, message boards and intranet systems among the City's \"bulge bracket\" bankers have been buzzing with speculation, not so much about the diners' identity, but about what they it could have been celebrating. \"Big blowouts aren't that unusual,\" said one banker who specialises in syndicated loans - loans so large that they are parcelled out between banks to reduce the risk. \"But the market's been so quiet lately that the big question is: what were they working on? No one knows for sure, but I bet it wasn't the boss's fucking birthday.\" Traditionally, City spending sprees happen around one of three events: the signing of a big deal with a client, the successful completion of a mega-money event such as a flotation or buyout, or the payment of an annual bonus. Of these, the client beanfeasts tend to be more sedate affairs, because the client may not be too impressed by excess - drunken or monetary - being paid for out of their fees. Bonus celebrations also tend to be short and sharp - buying a Lotus Elise, say, or the more traditional Rolex Oyster - rather than long and liquid, because the cost is coming out of the individual banker's pockets. The real daddy of a celebration tends to be the post-deal binge, because it uses other people's money, is not under the client's disapproving eye, and is justified by the huge fees that have just been racked up. And that's why \u00a344k can be slipped through on expenses: it's a small price for the bank or similar to pay if the celebrants have just earned the firm \u00a310m in a stroke. To put that sort of figure into context, one City bank, the US-owned Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, has advised on European mergers and acquisition deals worth a total of $102bn in the first six months of this year alone. Merrill Lynch, one of the biggest of the \"bulge bracket\" investment houses, made a $1bn profit from trading bonds in the first three months of this year. As the head of public relations at one big European bank explained: \"If you're the HoD [head of department] and your 'rain-makers' [the people responsible for generating big business] want to order the Chateau P\u00e9trus, you don't say no. You say, 'The 1945 or the 1946?' \" In fact, the most unusual thing about the P\u00e9trus oenophiles' bill - apart from its size - is the publicity it has received. Even the Square Mile's high earners are aware of wide-spread public distaste for fat cats, and there has been a trend for the bigger expense account bashes to take place in cities such as Paris or New York, out of the sight of jealous colleagues, competitors and the press. That record drinks tab may represent the high-water mark of the financial boom that started in the early 1990s and continued to rush onwards and upwards for 10 years before the wave broke earlier this year and the tide began to go out. That \u00a344,000 is likely to be the last hurrah of a once-in-a-generation bull run that saw record fees being raked in from mega-mergers and internet start-ups that sold like hot cakes before investors went cold turkey. In that 10-year span, more and more staff were employed in financial services - rain-makers, bankers, accountants, lawyers, IT specialists, PR people and advertising agents - with the funds being sucked up from institutional investors such as pension funds, and filtered out into the rest of the economy through estate agents, upmarket car dealers and Gordon Ramsay's wine cellar - and his wine seller. But since March this year the story has been different. The savage decline in technology stocks and the bursting of the internet bubble has meant fewer corks being popped. Figures like 44,000 in the City are now more likely to be staff cuts and redundancy payouts than expenses claims. Just as the celebrations are bigger, so the City's belt-tightening wouldn't be recognised by those of us on the rest of the planet. In April a memo from management at the investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston told staff to rein in the cost of entertaining clients. The memo from Tony James and Chuck Ward, co-heads of investment banking, said: \"Given current market conditions, try to keep dinners below $10,000, particularly when no travel is involved.\" The key word there is \"try\" - meaning that a dinner for around 20 people to celebrate a deal would cost an austere \u00a3350 a head if the guideline was accepted. Similar mild clampdowns are in force throughout the City, and Ramsay might not sell too many more bottles of the top-notch claret this year. The irony is that the party also polished off two bottles of Kronenbourg beer at \u00a33.50 each - and the economics of running a restaurant being what they are, Ramsay and his co-owners probably made more in terms of percentage mark-up from the humble lager than from the Chateau P\u00e9trus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
