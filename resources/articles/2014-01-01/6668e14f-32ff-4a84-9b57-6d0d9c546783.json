From four invitees in 2013, the number of guests of the first lady invited this year to spotlight the problem of gun violence in the US is one. She is Antoinette Tuff, a bookkeeper from Georgia credited with preventing a shooting at an elementary school in an Atlanta suburb by talking the would-be shooter out of it. Otherwise, the makeup of Michelle Obama\u2019s viewing box for Tuesday night\u2019s speech is largely unchanged from a year ago. Among her 22 guests (Jill Biden and Valerie Jarrett aside) are small businesses' proprietors and employees, overachieving students, young immigrants, beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act and a wounded veteran. President Barack Obama ended his 2013 State of the Union speech with an emotional call for Congress to vote on new gun legislation. Underscoring the point was the presence in the first lady\u2019s visitor box of the parents of a Chicago teenager killed in gun violence; a police lieutenant who was shot 15 times when he responded to the mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin; and a teacher at Sandy Hook elementary in Newtown, Connecticut. New to the box this year are Carlos Arredondo and Jeff Bauman, who survived the Boston Marathon bombing. The pair is well known from photographs of Arredondo, in a cowboy hat, helping Bauman, who lost parts of both legs in the attack. The first lady has also invited Gary Bird, the fire chief of Moore, Oklahoma. President Obama declared a major disaster area in the state in May after the town was hit by a tornado that killed 25 people and injured hundreds. Three pioneering women will join the first lady on Tuesday night, including the first woman to become a four-star admiral, Vice Admiral Michelle Howard; the first woman to become CEO of General Motors, Mary Barra; and Andrea Rush, a descendant of the Mohawk tribe who founded and runs a successful trucking and manufacturing company. Attendees from the business world include Peter Mouskondis, CEO and president of a Salt Lake City-based, family-owned food service company; and two people from a pizza joint in St Paul, Minnesota: Punch Pizza owner John Soranno, who voluntarily boosted his employees\u2019 minimum wage; and employee Nick Chute, who benefited. Also attending will be Tyrone Davis, a fellow with the environmental defence fund\u2019s climate corps. Davis\u2019s recommendations for emission caps saved Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina tens of thousands of dollars annually, the White House said. He has been legally blind since the age of nine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
