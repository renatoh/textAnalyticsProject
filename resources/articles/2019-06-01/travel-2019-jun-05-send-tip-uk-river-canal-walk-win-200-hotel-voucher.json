As well as the simple joy of being by the water, there\u2019s always plenty to see, a natural route to follow and often a cracking pub or cafe at the end of it. We want to hear about your favourite, including what to look out for along the way and any decent pitstops. Try to include starting points and any other useful information, including websites. We\u2019re only looking for walks in the UK this week. Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons, you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder.
