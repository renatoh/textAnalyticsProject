The Local Government Association, which represents 370 councils and boroughs across the country, wants the Department for Education to dilute regulations it introduced in England two years ago restricting the ability of headteachers to authorise pupils to take term-time breaks. The new policy has led to a drop in the number of state school pupils taking authorised holidays in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, but the proportion of those taking unauthorised holidays has barely changed, according to official statistics published on Tuesday. \u201cChildren\u2019s education is treated with the upmost seriousness but it is clear that the current system does not always favour families, especially those that are struggling to meet the demands of modern life or have unconventional work commitments,\u201d said Roy Perry, the chair of the LGA\u2019s children and young people committee. \u201cThere has to be a sensible solution whereby every family has the option to spend time together when they choose to, without fear of prosecution from education authorities.\u201d Schools minister Nick Gibb said the government would be sticking to its guns and said teachers had discretion to grant leave in exceptional circumstances. \u201cIf the request is for something that could easily take place in the school holidays then the headteacher should not give permission, and that would include holidays,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cBut if it\u2019s for something like a funeral, then the headteacher would be able to give permission, but not for an extended holiday on the back of that funeral.\u201d Children can also be granted leave when long-serving service personnel come home from tours of duty abroad, he added. Gibb said it was necessary to tighten the rules in 2010 because there was \u201can impression given that every parent was entitled to two weeks\u2019 leave to take their child on holiday and that was increasing\u201d. \u201cOur data shows that just a week off a year in the leadup to GCSEs can reduce that child\u2019s chances of getting good GCSEs by up to a quarter. Any absence, even if it\u2019s an illness actually, can damage the long-term chances of a child. Under regulations introduced in September 2013, schools in England no longer have the latitude to approve term-time holidays apart from in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d, according to the DfE\u2019s guidelines. The result has been a surge in the number of fines and prosecutions of parents for unauthorised absences. Headteachers previously had discretion to grant up to two weeks\u2019 term-time leave to pupils with good attendance records. Parents can be issued with fines of \u00a360 per child by local authorities, rising to \u00a3120 if unpaid after three weeks. Courts can issue fines of up to \u00a32,500 or jail sentences of up to three months in extreme cases, although those usually involve extended absence or truancy. Craig Langman, the founder of the organisation Parents Want a Say, called the current policy \u201ca massive sledgehammer to crack a nut\u201d. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a blanket ban. All that does is basically tell everyone: sorry you can\u2019t have any time off, in term time, you can\u2019t have quality family time. People cannot always take time off during the school-allocated summer holidays,\u201d he told Today. \u201cThe very people servicing us while we want to take our kids on holiday \u2013 when are they going to take time off, when they\u2019re servicing our needs? It\u2019s just not practical.\u201d The policy came under threat last week after a magistrate in the Isle of Wight threw out a case against a father who argued that his daughter attended school regularly despite taking her on a family holiday to Disneyworld in Florida during term time. Gibb said the case in the Isle of Wight would not set a precedent for future absences by children in term-time, because the ruling was made by a magistrates court. The LGA said that a \u201creasonable, common sense approach\u201d to term-time holidays should be allowed, which would in effect return to the policy in force prior to 2013. \u201cThe current rules tie families to set holiday periods. They make no allowances for what a family would class as a special occasion or takes into account a parent\u2019s worklife,\u201d Perry said. The latest figures published by the DfE showed that the new policy has been effective in deterring parents from taking holidays during term time. Before the 2013 school year, authorised family holidays accounted for about 5% and 6% of pupil absences. But since then the proportion dropped to 2.3% in 2013-14 and 1.2% in 2014-15. As the proportion of authorised absences has fallen, so the percentage of unauthorised holiday absences has risen, from 3.2% in 2012-13 to 4.4% in 2014-15. As a proportion of all pupil absences in terms of school days lost, unauthorised absences have stayed unchanged at 0.2% of pupil days since 2012, while authorised family holidays, which accounted for 0.3% of total pupil time in 2012-13, fell to just 0.1% in 2014-15. In total, 32.7m pupil school days were missed owing to authorised absences in the autumn term of 2012 and the spring term of 2013, with the total falling to 28.6m pupil days in 2014-15. Gibb hailed the latest figures as proof that the government\u2019s policies on pupil absence were making \u201creal progress\u201d. \u201cWe took action to reduce absence in 2010 by taking a tougher approach to children regularly missing lessons and by increasing fines,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether with our reforms to improve behaviour and plans to crack down on truancy by deducting the cost of unpaid fines from child benefit, we have put heads and teachers firmly back in charge of their classrooms so they can extend opportunity and give the pupils the best start to life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
