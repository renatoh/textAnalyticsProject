Police and other authorities identified 3,266 people last year thought to have been the victims of modern slavery compared with 946 in 2011, a rise that has prompted disquiet among MPs and charities. The figures from the National Referral Mechanism \u2013 a government safeguarding framework that aims to help potential victims of trafficking \u2013 reveal a steady rise of potential slavery victims over the last five years, with the single largest annual increase between 2014 and 2015 when nearly 1,000 extra cases were recorded. Although ministers believe the figures suggest more victims were willing to come forward for help, others are urging the police to step up their efforts and argue the statistics confirmed that trafficking and slavery are thriving in the UK. Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: \u201cPolice forces can and must do more to crack down on this barbaric crime. Slavery is abhorrent and has absolutely no place in the world. It is utterly gut-wrenching to think about people in bondage, in Britain, being held against their will.\u201d Andrew Wallis, founder and chief executive of the anti-slavery charity Unseen, said the rise showed the reality of an underground trade driven by the exploitation of people. \u201cWhat\u2019s driving it is the demand for cheap goods, cheap labour, cheap sex and there\u2019s an insatiable demand that causes questions for society as a whole. On the other side, there\u2019s an endless supply of vulnerable people.\u201d Wallis said that although the UK government passed the Modern Slavery Act in 2014, more needs to be done. Jakub Sobik, of campaign group Anti-Slavery International, agreed but believes the statistics show a greater awareness among the authorities. Karen Bradley, minister for preventing abuse, exploitation and crime, said: \u201cWe are committed to tackling modern slavery \u2013 including human trafficking. Increases in the number of referrals are a sign that our efforts are working.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
