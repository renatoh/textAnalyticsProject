The cub, who has shared an enclosure with his mother, Victoria, in the Scottish Highlands for the past two and a half years, was transported to Yorkshire on Wednesday. Hamish was born in December 2017 at Highland Wildlife Park, near Aviemore, and his name was chosen through a public vote. Since his birth thousands of people have visited the park to catch a glimpse of him. However, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) had always planned to move him to another zoo once he was old enough to leave his mother. Earlier this year the wildlife conservation charity announced that he would be moving to Yorkshire Wildlife Park\u2019s Project Polar habitat following a recommendation from the European Endangered Species Programme. Rachel Williams, senior animal keeper at Highland Wildlife Park, said it was a natural time for the playful cub to move on but that he would be missed, although his mother would finally get to enjoy some quiet time. \u201cIn the wild, polar bear cubs will stay with their mothers for two to three years, so this is a natural time for Hamish to be moving on,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cIt has been an incredible two and a half years watching him grow and he will be missed by everyone here at the park. \u201c[But] we\u2019re sure Victoria will appreciate some peace and quiet before any next steps in the breeding programme.\u201d Hamish\u2019s father, Arktos, remains in an enclosure in another part of the Scottish park. Williams said Victoria and Arktos could be \u201cpaired up\u201d again next year. David Field, RZSS\u2019s chief executive, said Hamish had been an incredible ambassador for his relatives in the wild, playing a crucial role in educating the public about threats faced by many species. \u201cA critical part of our role as a wildlife conservation charity is education. Hamish has made a tremendous impression on the thousands of people who visited the park since his birth two and a half years ago, and the billions who saw the news around the world,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cHe has helped to highlight the threats many species face in the wild and the changes we can undertake to really make a difference. \u201cChanges in the Arctic climate mean the sea ice that wild polar bears, and other animals, depend on for survival is shrinking and it is predicted this will significantly decrease population numbers over the next 40 years.\u201d Hamish made the seven-hour journey to Doncaster by road. Yorkshire Wildlife Park\u2019s head of animals, Dr Matt Hartley, said: \u201cWe are delighted to be welcoming Hamish to Project Polar where he will join our other male bears. \u201cOur expansive reserves allow social interaction, play, exploration and behavioural development that is vital for bear wellbeing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
