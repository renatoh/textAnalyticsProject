However, he told ABC news in Perth on Wednesday that Abbott had a strong commitment to Indigenous issues. Abbott has received widespread criticism for the remark, which he made while defending the Barnett government\u2019s proposed \u201cclosure\u201d of up to 150 of Western Australia\u2019s 274 communities. Barnett foreshadowed the plan after the federal government announced it would withdraw funding from essential services in those communities, leaving that responsibility and a $90m transitional fund with the state. Respected Western Australian elder and Yamatji-Marlpa Aboriginal co-chair, Doris Eaton, said she was angry at comments made by both Abbott and Barnett over the closures, saying governments should spend time in individual communities if they wanted to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous outcomes in Australia. Mrs Eaton said it was disappointing to hear living on traditional country, which she said was central to Aboriginal identity, dismissed as a \u201clifestyle choice\u201d. \u201cWe are not a tenant on our own country,\u201d Mrs Eaton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about lifestyle choices. It\u2019s about culturally living on country.\u201d \u201cOur ancestors walked this land and so we are going to walk this land.\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just punish people because they are living on the land, that\u2019s where they are from. We are not just shifted here from the moon.\u201d Mrs Eaton, a Nyamal woman who lives in Yandeyarra, a remote Aboriginal community about 100km south of Port Hedland, told Guardian Australia she was concerned the push to close communities was an attempt to weaken cultural - and therefore legal - ties to land. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took the land off us, they took the kids off us, now they are going back to the same route that they done, moving people off their land. \u201cThe saddest part (about native title) was we have got to prove that we are Aboriginal people that are connected to the land. And now we have to do it all over again.\u201d The National Native Title Council\u2019s chief executive, Brian Wyatt, said demands placed on native title claimants in Western Australian to prove an ongoing cultural connection to country were the highest in Australia, which made it \u201cvery difficult\u201d to prove native title unless claimants lived on their country. \u201cPeople have spent years fighting for their native title rights in court where they have to prove an ongoing connection to their country only to have governments deliberately trying to sever those ties by removing people from their cultural lands,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cThis is outrageous and frankly very close to threatening our cultural genocide.\u201d The federal Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, said that Abbott\u2019s description of living on remote communities as \u201clifestyle choices\u201d was a \u201cmistake\u201d and would make his job harder. Abbott defended his record on Indigenous affairs to reporters in Mount Gambier in South Australia on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable with my credentials when it comes to doing the right thing by the Aboriginal people of Australia,\u201d he said. Barnett has also received criticism in Western Australia for again linking the closure of remote communities to child sex abuse. \u201cChildren aren\u2019t attending school, young children are being abused both physically and sexually, there are no employment opportunities, and I cannot look the people of Western Australia in the face and say, as premier, I am going to ignore that,\u201d he told ABC news on Wednesday. The National Native Title Council, WA opposition and land councils have all accused the government of generalising problems in remote communities and using child sex abuse as a foil for what remains a financial decision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
