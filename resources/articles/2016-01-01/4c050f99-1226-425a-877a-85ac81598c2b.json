The spirits of last season\u2019s Premiership finalists, whose attacking template excited the previous England management for a while, are damp. Their running game has dried up and they started the new year in the bottom half of the Premiership and needing to win at least one of their two away games in the European Champions Cup to have a chance of making the quarter-finals. The first is against Toulon on Sunday and at least the weather in the Mediterranean resort promises to be sunny. \u201cI cannot remember the last time I played when it was dry,\u201d says the Bath fly-half George Ford. \u201cThere has not been much rugby played, to be honest, with the combination of the rain and wind making it difficult to attack, and maybe our fundamentals have not been good enough in the conditions.\u201d Wasps and Glasgow, two other teams who look to run, have also struggled in recent weeks and Bath\u2019s dip has come at the wrong time with the England squad being announced on Wednesday by the new head coach, Eddie Jones: four of their backs, Ford, Anthony Watson, Jonathan Joseph and Semesa Rokoduguni are in line to be selected but none is nailed down for a place in the starting lineup. \u201cYou cannot be thinking about the England squad,\u201d says Ford. \u201cWe have three massive games in Europe in the next three weeks and our full attention has to be on them otherwise we will be in trouble. Of course you need to be playing well for your club but sometimes when a team is not playing to its full potential people can get tarnished with the same brush: there have been some very good performances by our England players and Toulon is a great opportunity. \u201cThey have a squad full of international and world-class players that have been European champions for the last three years. We understand what we are coming up against and are massively excited about playing at Stade Mayol and its great atmosphere. In a funny sort of way it is a great game for us because we understand if we do not turn up at the weekend and perform as we did against Newcastle [last week], they will make us pay. All the lads will be up for it and we know there has to be a reaction.\u201d Ford\u2019s father, Mike, the Bath head coach, publicly criticised his charges after becoming Newcastle\u2019s first Premiership victims of the season. The defeat left the club with three victories in eight league matches before the Six Nations, when a number of players will be away, and the squad held an honesty session at the start of the week with the players assessing their own performances. \u201cResults have not gone our way this season and it is not down to one particular thing,\u201d says Ford. \u201cWithin each game we have identified why we did not quite get the result \u2013 discipline, ball control or a few defensive errors; the challenge for us is to address them quickly and put in a complete performance. I do not think we are far away. Some of the games have been very close and come down to one or two moments. We are fully confident as individuals and a team that we can start picking up results again. We are not at the halfway stage yet in the Premiership and there are plenty of points to play for. We are still in Europe and, although we will probably have to win all three games, we believe we can progress from this group. \u201cI was not surprised at what my dad said. As players we look at ourselves first and we know that the performance at Newcastle was not good enough. You can prepare as well as you like in the week but it is the 80 minutes which count and we did not turn up last weekend. He made valid points and we have to take it on the chin and make sure it does not happen again. The coaches always look at themselves first, what they could have done better in the week and on the day and it is only right that we players do so as well. We usually get match reports after a game which give the key stats and comments from the coaches but this week the players put their own comments on and gave them to the coaches.\u201d Last season Ford cemented his place in the England side, displacing his rival and friend Owen Farrell at outside-half and helping refine England\u2019s attacking game. He was dropped from the side for the World Cup group match against Wales for reasons he still does not fully appreciate and, while he has been in a Bath team struggling for form, Farrell\u2019s club Saracens went into the new year unbeaten in the league and Europe. \u201cSaracens have great fundamentals to their game, defence, breakdown, kick-chase, which they do every week and are a very difficult team to beat,\u201d says Ford. \u201cWe like to have more of an attacking mindset but you have to have those fundamentals in your game and give yourself the foundation to attack. They are five or six years down the line and this is our third: that is not an excuse because we should be in a better position but we have to stick with what we are and what we believe in because, when we come through the other end, it will cement that belief. \u201cWe just have to be a lot more accurate and smart. Teams are more prepared against us after last season and this is the toughest Premiership I have played in. We have to take our game to the next level, mentally rather than tactically. I have not spoken to Eddie Jones but it is the start of a new era for England and that is always exciting.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
