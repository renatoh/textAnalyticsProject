The goalkeeper collapsed spectacularly after the incident with the fan, who had run on the pitch to celebrate Scott McDonald's 90th-minute winner. Celtic, as expected, received a fine after a three-hour meeting of the Uefa control and disciplinary body for failing to control their supporters and a lack of organisation. Dida, a Brazilian, had initially attempted to chase the supporter, making his actions appear all the more ridiculous. He was taken from the field on a stretcher and, with Milan unable to provide a satisfactory reason for his substitution, European football's governing body implemented disciplinary proceedings on the basis that \"member associations, clubs, as well as their players, officials and members, shall conduct themselves according to the principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship\". Celtic were fined 60,000 Swiss francs (\u00a325,000), with half suspended for two years. The club will not appeal. \"We feel this penalty is proportionate to the incident in question and a fair outcome,\" said the Celtic chief executive, Peter Lawwell. The man who invaded the pitch, Robert McHendry, has been banned by the club from attending future Celtic matches and has been charged at Glasgow Sheriff Court with breach of the peace. Dida is now set to miss his club's back-to-back Champions League matches against Shakhtar Donetsk but will be available for Celtic's trip to the San Siro on December 4. Milan last night said they would appeal. The club's lawyer, Leandro Cantamessa, described Dida's ban as \"illogical\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
