After Tiger Woods' declaration that areas of the Lytham &amp; St Annes rough were \"unplayable\" Darren Clarke, the defending champion, offered a similarly stark assessment of conditions while Ian Poulter claimed he saw the rough being watered during his Monday morning practice round. Dawson, however, delivered a firm \"no\" when asked if conditions are unfair. \"The rough is up but the course is reasonably generous on width and most of the players seem happy with it, at least those I have spoken to, maybe 20 or so,\" he said. \"It's nature. We are not starting bailing rough on seaside courses. It grows in the month before the championship. Some years we have a dry summer [and] you get wispy rough; in wetter warmish conditions you get thick rough and a softer course. We don't cut the rough other than the first and second cut.\" Clarke pointed out the difficulties players could face. \"Even if they do find the balls in some of those areas, I don't know if you'll be able to take a full swing and move it. It is really thick, so there could be some lost balls in there. \"There's a few patches out there where it's just absolutely brutal. The grass is quite thick. It's not quite what we would expect in links. The grass is going different ways and it's quite thick. It's a little bit thicker than what you normally find on a links golf course. It's really, really tough.\" Poulter admitted surprise at what he had witnessed due to the way the rough was playing. \"The wispy stuff isn't really a problem, it is more to do with the six inches at the bottom that has turned green,\" he said. \"Normally in Opens that stays pretty dry, you can get a club through it and you get a flier. There won't be any fliers coming out of the rough this week. In places you will actually do well to find it. It's unfortunate it has grown up as thick as that. \"When I was out there at 4.50am this morning I did see them watering the rough. I can't even remember on what hole but I was scratching the top of my head thinking\u201a 'Wow.'\" Dawson also sought to play down any sense that the Open could be a high-profile sporting victim of the wet British summer. Appalling conditions disrupted the Formula One grand prix at Silverstone earlier this month and 40mm of rain has been predicted in the days immediately preceding this championship at Lytham. \"We lost a day's play in 1988 at Lytham but drainage here is much better now,\" Dawson said. \"We have rain, a wet week but we will cope with it. Our car park contingency is very strong. There is only one of our car parks that could be a problem and we have hard standing contingency elsewhere, so we are not into a Silverstone situation. \"I am not sitting here saying we are not going to have a problem. We might. The issue is the water table is very high. They have a pumping station at the far end of Lytham which pumps everything out into the inlet and that had not been switched on. Now it is on and pumping furiously but the whole area here has a very high water table. [There has been] unprecedented rainfall. We never had a summer like it. \"This course has proved itself to recover from rain very quickly. The water table can be higher than the floor of a couple of bunkers here. If that's the case you pump it out and it just comes back in. So we will have to see what we get. The rules are written for such circumstances.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
