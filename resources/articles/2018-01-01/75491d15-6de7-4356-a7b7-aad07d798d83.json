The department said it had filed an appeal in the ninth circuit court and intends to \u201ctake the rare step\u201d later this week of seeking a fast track to the supreme court. The announcement came as the fate of nearly 700,000 Dreamers, who were brought to the US as children, has raised the specter of a government shutdown with lawmakers in Washington at an impasse over immigration. William Alsup, a US district judge in California, ordered the Trump administration last week to continue processing renewals for the 2012 program established by Barack Obama, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), which granted temporary legal status to Dreamers. In announcing the administration\u2019s decision to appeal against the ruling on Tuesday, the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: \u201cIt defies both law and common sense for Daca \u2026 to somehow be mandated nationwide by a single district court in San Francisco. \u201cWe are now taking the rare step of requesting direct review on the merits of this injunction by the supreme court so that this issue may be resolved quickly and fairly for all the parties involved.\u201d Trump announced in September he was rescinding Daca and gave Congress until 5 March to pass a replacement. The resulting debate on Capitol Hill over how to resolve the issue through legislation has rattled negotiations over funding for the government, which is due to expire on Friday. Absent a deal in the next four days, Congress looked increasingly poised for its first government shutdown since 2013. The president pre-emptively cast blame on Democrats, who have demanded that any bill to fund the government be accompanied by protections for Dreamers. \u201cThe Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday. \u201cThe biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military, at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery.\u201d During a shutdown, vital government services such as law enforcement and air traffic control would continue, as would benefit programs like social security, Medicare and Medicaid. But national parks would close, and many federal bureaucrats would be sent home. Analysts have projected that the cost of furloughing federal employees could total $6.5bn a week and \u201cpossibly snuff out any economic momentum\u201d. Speaking to Bloomberg, Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said a shutdown would pose a serious threat to global stock markets, which have hit a series of record highs since Trump\u2019s inauguration, something the president has tried to associate himself with personally. \u201cUncertainty is bad for the global economy,\u201d said Stiglitz. \u201cAnd among the uncertainties are these government shutdowns, which would be probably very bad for the markets.\u201d Democrats believe tying fixing Daca to a must-pass spending bill will coerce more lawmakers to vote in favor of a compromise, given the deep partisan divide over immigration. Republicans have deemed them to be separate issues, but have privately expressed concern that a shutdown would call into question their ability to govern as the party that controls Washington. There has never been a shutdown of the federal government with just one party in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. S&amp;P Global said the impact of a shutdown would be felt throughout the US economy: \u201cA disruption in government spending means no government paychecks to spend; lost business and revenue to private contractors; lost sales at retail shops, particularly those that circle now-closed national parks; and less tax revenue for Uncle Sam. That means less economic activity and fewer jobs.\u201d Almost 1 million people will not get regular paychecks if a shutdown happens, S&amp;P said. \u201cWith each day the shutdown drags on, federal workers may start to pull back on household spending at restaurants, childcare, or retail stores because of worries that they won\u2019t get paid anytime soon,\u201d it said. Efforts to hash out an agreement were severely undermined last week when it was reported that Trump questioned the need to admit immigrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d. The president\u2019s remarks reportedly came during a private meeting with lawmakers while discussing immigrants from Haiti and El Salvador, who have been provided temporary protected status by the US government. The Trump administration has moved to strip them of that status, potentially forcing out of the country as many as 200,000 Salvadorans and 60,000 Haitians. The White House denied on Tuesday that Trump\u2019s comments might have paved the way for a shutdown. \u201cNo, I think he\u2019s worried that Democrats\u2019 unwillingness to put country ahead of their party is what\u2019s stalling things,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said. Sanders said the White House\u2019s position was that immigration and spending talks should be kept separate. The growing discord has prompted Republican leaders to discuss a short-term stopgap measure to avert a shutdown by midnight on Friday. Members of Congress passed a similar resolution in December, kicking the deadline to 19 January. Democrats earned criticism from immigration activists for failing to hold the line in December. They face mounting pressure not to stall on protections for Dreamers. Internal divisions remain within the party over whether a shutdown is necessary without a solution on Daca. Trump\u2019s latest controversial remarks on immigrants nonetheless appeared to mark a turning point. At a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Democrats grilled Kristjen Nielsen, Trump\u2019s homeland security secretary, on her boss\u2019s attitude toward immigrants. Nielsen said she did not recall Trump\u2019s specific remark about African countries, prompting a swift rebuke from Cory Booker, one of just three black senators. \u201cYour silence and your amnesia is complicity,\u201d he said. She was also asked about Trump\u2019s alleged remarks backing immigration from countries like Norway, which as Senator Patrick Leahy pointed out is \u201cpredominantly white\u201d. \u201cI actually do not know that, sir, but I imagine that is the case,\u201d Nielsen replied."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
