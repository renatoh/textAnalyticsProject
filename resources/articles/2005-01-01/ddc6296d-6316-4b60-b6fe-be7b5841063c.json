Manchester City's record \u00a313m signing has missed the club's last three matches after complaining of pains in his groin and back prior to the Premiership draw at Arsenal on January 4. A series of tests have failed to reveal any reason why Anelka has been unable to play or train for the last fortnight and Kevin Keegan, the City manager, hoped the latest thorough examination would unearth the cause of the pain. However, after receiving the results, Keegan was only able to confirm there was 'no serious damage' to Anelka's groin, meaning the former Real Madrid striker could theoretically return for Saturday's televised trip to West Brom. Such a scenario seems unlikely, though, given Anelka has not trained since refusing to take a fitness test ahead of the Arsenal game and will not get the chance to do so until tomorrow at the earliest after Keegan handed his players a day off. It means the 25-year-old is not likely to play again until the visit of Newcastle on February 2, by which time the transfer window will have closed and Anelka's short-term future resolved. Reports of a possible transfer to Fenerbahce continue, although City officials have again confirmed there has been no further contact from the Turkish outfit since their preliminary approach over a fortnight ago. Keegan is more concerned with Saturday's trip to The Hawthorns, especially as Robbie Fowler and Antoine Sibierski missed training this week with knee and ankle problems respectively. The double injury worry places even more emphasis on Keegan's search for a left-sided player to replace Ben Thatcher, who is set to join Fulham later this week. Keegan is hopeful of signing a loan replacement for Thatcher within the next 24 hours - but he revealed that Rangers' Michael Ball is not top of his shopping list. City have been linked with a move for Ball after it became public knowledge that Thatcher was heading for Fulham. Ball's ability to play on the left side of defence or midfield earmarked him as a prime candidate for a move back to England because, with Trevor Sinclair and Sun Jihai out for the season through injury, Keegan has only one left-footed player in his entire squad in young defender Stephen Jordan. But, after fielding 10 calls already about a possible replacement, Keegan confirmed he would only contact the Rangers manager Alex McLeish about Ball if a move for his first-choice target fell through. \"I am hoping to know within the next 24 hours about the outcome of a potential loan deal I have earmarked - and it is not Michael Ball,\" Keegan said. \"If for any reason that deal did not go through then Michael is certainly one of the ones we would look at. Michael is Premiership quality and at 25 is still young but of course he may not want to come on loan.\" Despite agreeing a reported \u00a3500,000 fee with Fulham for Thatcher, Keegan does not believe he has the finances to seal a permanent deal for a potential recruit. The City manager has previously indicated he would like to bring in a maximum of three new players during the transfer window, although those plans may have to be shelved due to the time he is spending assessing his most immediate need. \"You have to look at our situation as we can only loan, we cannot buy anyone,\" he said. \"The list of targets is not a massive one. Losing Ben is a blow and we have had to divert attention to that area and make it a priority but these things happen in football.\" Manchester United will take on the Chinese Super League outfit Beijing Hyundai next summer in the second game of their Far East tour. The Red Devils' first visit to the Chinese capital has been confirmed for July 26, three days after Sir Alex Ferguson's men have tackled the Hong Kong National XI. The imposing Beijing Worker's Stadium, which will be used during the 2008 Olympic Games, will stage the encounter as United look to build on their massive popularity in the region. \"We hope that by playing the pre-season match in Beijing we will encourage local youngsters to take up the sport and inspire some of them to reach the very highest levels of professional soccer,\" said United's commercial director Andy Anson, who promised Chinese fans would get to see all the Old Trafford club's major stars. This could include United's Chinese signing Dong Fangzhou, who signed for United in a \u00a33.5m deal last year but is currently on loan at Belgian feeder club Royal Antwerp."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
