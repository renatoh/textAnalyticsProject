But there\u2019s a long way to go yet, depending what happens this weekend on the coronavirus pandemic. Time for a closing summary, after some of the most turbulent days we\u2019ve seen in the City recently. Stock markets around the globe have suffered their worst week since the heights of the financial crisis more than a decade ago. After a blistering few days of selling, the European, UK and US stock markets all slumped by over 10% this week amid escalating fears of a global virus pandemic and a worldwide downturn. In the last few minutes, the US stock market had closed -- with the Dow Jones industrial average losing another 1.4% today. That takes its weekly losses to 12%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 shed more than \u00a3200bn this week, after tumbling by another 3.2% today. It\u2019s slumped by over 11% since Monday morning, after coronavirus cases jumped sharply outside of China - its third worst week since 1984. These charts show the story of the Footsie\u2019s wobble. Airline and holiday stocks have had an exceptionally bad week, with TUI down 30%. The slump may be alarming consumers -- Ocado has reported exceptional demand for its delivery slots. The corporate world continues to struggle - easyJet, British Airways and Lufthansa all announced they were cutting flights due to lack of demand. The Geneva motor show, one of Europe\u2019s big trade events, has been cancelled after Switzerland banned large gatherings. Gold price also fell, as some traders sold bullion to cover their stock market losses. Government bonds, though, have hit fresh record highs as investors bolt for safety. The scale of the sell-off has alarmed investors - just a week after the S&amp;P 500 was at an alltime high. Pension pots will already have been badly hit, and some economists fear the sell-off has further to run. Policymakers are attempting to calm the markets, but it\u2019s not clear how much they can do to tackle the crisis. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell issued a statement, insisting the \u2018fundamentals\u2019 of the US economy are still strong, but acknowledging that the virus is a threat. Donald Trump\u2019s economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, claimed that the market selloff had gone too far, as the White House tries to get a grip on the crisis. In the UK, the 20th patient to contract Covid-19 has been detected as the authorities brace for an emergency plan that would involve the military. That\u2019s all for tonight. Hope you have a good weekend, and stay safe. GW Newsflash: The US stock market has posted its worst weekly loss since autumn 2008. This is the seventh straight day of losses, pushing Wall Street down to levels not seen since last autumn. It inflicts more pain on investors large and small. So far this week, the S&amp;P 500 index of US companies has shed 11.5% while the Dow Jones industrial average has slumped by 12.3%. But it\u2019s not a complete disaster. Stocks have bounced off their lows in the final few minutes of the trading session, meaning the losses aren\u2019t quite as brutal as earlier in the day. So, the S&amp;P 500 ended down 0.8%, or 24.54 points lower, at 2,954.22. The Dow has closed down 1.39%, losing 357 points to 25,409. And lets give a big hand to the Nasdaq, which actually ended the day flat. There\u2019s no sign of a late rally on Wall Street. With 20 minutes to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 907 points or 3.5% -- ending the week on a real low point. Money is continuing to pour into US government bonds tonight, driving the yield (or interest rate) to fresh record lows. 10-year Treasury bills are now yielding just 1.12% - a remarkably low interest rate that flashes danger signs. If investors are buying bond at that level, they\u2019re desperate to preserve capital and worried about a recession. The US stock market is now over 13% below its record highs, set just last week(!). That\u2019s officially a correction. And if the markets keep falling at their current rate, it\u2019ll be a full-blown bear market - defined as a 20% decline. Michael Every, senior strategist at Rabobank, thinks its a logical risk. \u201cWe are now past a mere 10% technical correction and seem to be heading for a bear market, which is only logical when one considers the global backdrop. We really can\u2019t blame Jerome Powell for trying to reassure the markets with his statement tonight. But the reality is that central banks are somewhat powerless in the face of a virulent pandemic. Indeed, earlier today another senior US central banker dampened hopes that interest rates might be slashed in response to the Covid-19 crisis. St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard told the Arkansas chamber of commerce that a rate cut is possible if the situation deteriorate, but not as nailed on as markets think. He said: \u201cFurther policy rate cuts are a possibility if a global pandemic actually develops with health effects approaching the scale of ordinary influenza, but this is not the baseline case at this time.\u201d Bullard also expressed optimism that Covid-19 will be brought under control, helping markets to recover. Here\u2019s confirmation that Britain\u2019s stock market just suffered its third-worst week since 1984, from Sky\u2019s Ed Conway. Newsflash: America\u2019s top central banker has said the Federal Reserve will act \u201cas appropriate\u201d to protect the US economy from the coronavirus crisis. In a statement just released, Jerome Powell says: \u201cThe fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong \u201cHowever, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201d This appears to be an attempt to reassure the markets. But while stocks are coming off their earlier lows, they are still sharply down today. The Dow is currently 2% lower, down 538 points at 25,228. The coronavirus will have a massive impact on the world economy, affecting techology, transport, retail and telecoms as well as the market. Here\u2019s our round-up of what\u2019s happening, and what could happen next: Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s market losses, including the \u00a3200bn wiped off the FTSE 100: UK online grocer Ocado has emailed some customers tonight, saying it is experiencing a lot more demand than usual. I suspect this is households looking to stock up, in case the coronavirus leads to shortages in the shops. Ocado says: We want to let you know that we\u2019re experiencing exceptionally high demand at the moment. More people than usual seem to be placing particularly large orders. As a result, delivery slots are selling out quicker than expected. Ocado wants its customers to place their orders \u201ca little further in advance\u201d, and ideally not on Friday and Saturday as they\u2019re \u201cunusually busy\u201d. With two hours to go until the closing bell, Wall Street is still deep in the red. Unless there\u2019s a dramatic and frankly implausible turnaround, the New York market will post its worst week since October 2008. And the Dow could yet post another 1,000-point slump. Here\u2019s the damage right now: Dow: down 924 points or 3.5% at 24,842 S&amp;P 500: down 78 points or 2.62% at 2,900 Nasdaq: down 168 points or 2% at 8,397 Vanguard, the asset management giant, appears to have had some technical issues today: Presumably a lot of Vanguard\u2019s 30 million investors have been checking how much this week\u2019s turmoil has cost them. Some will have been trying to cash out, while some brave souls will have been buying. We\u2019ll soon know which was the right strategy.... German airline group Lufthansa has just announced it is cutting flight capacity, due to the Covid-19 crisis. It plans to cut short- and medium-haul flights by up to 25%, and will also drop some long-haul flights too. Lufthansa also warned that it cannot assess the impact of coronavirus on its profits - echoing similar comments from British Airway\u2019s parent company IAG this morning. Analysts at MUFG bank fear we could see further losses before this correction has played out. The US election race, and the UK-EU trade calks, could both rattle markets - they told clients tonight: The near 15% collapse in the S&amp;P 500 this week could have more to go. We see more fundamental justification for this extending than the fundamental backdrop to the 15% correction in December 2018.... Amongst the unfavourable backdrop of COVID-19 risks, next week we have Super Tuesday; the start of the UK-EU trade negotiations and a Bank of Canada policy meeting. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says fears of a global recession and serious disruption to our lives is behind the selloff: \u201cIt is official: this is worst week for the UK stock market since the global financial crisis. The FTSE 100 has dropped 11.1% (or 823 points) on the week to 6,580, the third worst weekly showing for the index since records began in 1984.... \u201cCompanies are already experiencing supply chain problems and the idea that many people might be forced to work from home could impact productivity. Shutting schools would also compound the problem as parents would have to look after their children and may not be able to work, and consumer spending would likely fall.\u201d Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets finds the stock market reaction severe. \u201cTo be sure, we sympathize with the narrative that some economic activity could be lost for good. In other words, you don\u2019t double up on certain services spending once the dust settles because you put it off on COVID-19 fears. [But]Even if we are looking at a supply shock where postponed activity does not fully get recaptured, it still does not warrant a [more than] 10% repricing in a market that is supposed to be forward-looking in nature and ultimately realigns with fundamentals,\u201d Stock brokers AJ Bell have very helpfully worked out the biggest fallers on the London stock market this week. And it\u2019s no surprise that holiday firms TUI tops the list, with several airlines close behind, due to concerns that tough travel restrictions will be imposed (and that consumers will shun foreign holidays anyway). Here are the stocks you really didn\u2019t want to own this week, across the blue-chip FTSE 100 and smaller FTSE 350 BIGGEST LOSERS ON THE WEEK TUI -30% Playtech -28% EasyJet -27% SIG -27% Premier Oil -24% International Consolidated Airlines -24% SSP -24% Jupiter Fund Management -23% William Hill -23% Wizz Air -23% The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK companies also had a thoroughly dire week. It fell by 2.29% today, meaning it has lost 11% of its value since Monday morning (just like its big sibling, the Footsie). Although the markets have a very painful week, it pales alongside the suffering of those who have lost loved ones to Covid-19. The death toll is rising towards 3,000, including the first Briton today. With more than 80,000 cases already officially reported, the virus is causing an awful lot of misery. But while it can feel impersonal to bang on about the stock market, the unfortunate truth is that falling share prices will have an impact on people too. For example, British pension funds have lost 5%-6% of their value in the last five days, as my colleague Miles Brignall and Rupert Jones report: Until a week ago, employees who were about to retire were looking at their pension statements with some confidence after share prices had hit record highs around the world. Shares in the US tech stocks, in which many UK pension funds are invested, had seemingly been on an ever-upward trajectory. However, after a week in which global stock markets plunged and predictions that the outbreak could match the financial crash of 2008, imminent retirees are facing a far less certain future, than even a week ago. European stocks markets have also suffered their worst week since the financial crisis of autumn 2008. The Stoxx 600 has shed 12.2% this week, with big losses on the German Dax (-12.4% this week) and the Italian FTSE MIB (-11.3%), as well as the FTSE 100 (-11.1%). Daniel Grosvenor of Oxford Economics fears more turmoil ahead, as fears of a global downturn mount: We believe equities will remain under pressure. The sell-off is now in-line with the average \u2018non-recessionary\u2019 correction, but a recession is a growing risk and it is difficult to see how conventional policy easing can calm investor\u2019s nerves. Reuters has calculated that the coronavirus panic has now wiped almost $6 trillion off global markets this week, thanks to the latest losses in Wall Street and Europe. That\u2019s based on the MSCI All-Country World Index, a broad measure of global equities. Here\u2019s their take: The rout showed no signs of slowing as Europe\u2019s main markets slumped 3-5% and the ongoing dive for safety sent yields on U.S. government bonds, widely seen as the world\u2019s most secure asset, to fresh record lows. Hopes that the epidemic which started in China would be over in months and that economic activity would quickly return to normal have been shattered this week as the number of international cases spiralled. Bets are now that the Federal Reserve will cut U.S. interest rates as soon as next month and other major central banks will follow to try and nurse economies through the troubles and stave off a global recession. \u201cThe volatility isn\u2019t as surprising as the fact that it took so long to rear its head. However, the recent swings indicate the complacency that appears to have settled over markets during the earlier stages of the outbreak has been dislodged,\u201d said Paras Anand, CIO, Asia Pacific at Fidelity International. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the FTSE 100 slumped by 11% this week, its worst run since autumn 2008 when the financial sector was on the brink. As you can see, it fell sharply on Monday - losing 3.5%, after Italy reported a shock jump in coronavirus cases. It followed this with a 1.9% drop on Tuesday, as more cases were reported globally. Wednesday provided some stabilisation. But fears of a global pandemic, triggering a world recession, triggered yesterday\u2019s 3.5% tumble -- dragging the Footsie into a correction. With Wall Street plunging again last night, today only saw more pain, taking total losses on the blue-chip index to over 800 points, or more than \u00a3200bn. This chart of the FTSE 100 over the last five years gives some sense of the scale of this week\u2019s rout: Newsflash: More than \u00a3200bn has been wiped off Britain\u2019s leading shares this week, as the Covid-19 crisis triggered the worst sell-off in over a decade. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has just closed for the day, down 3.18%. That\u2019s a fall of 215 points, taking the index down to 6580 points. I think that\u2019s the lowest closing level since July 2016. Today\u2019s losses knock another \u00a353bn off the blue-chip index, and mean it has lost more than 11% this week. And that takes the total weekly losses to around \u00a3206bn -- which will have a serious impact on the nation\u2019s pension pots, ISA, trust funds and other savings. European stock markets have provisionally closed with a 3.8% slump. We\u2019re just waiting for the final numbers on the FTSE 100 now (it\u2019s gone into a closing auction, which could take a little while). Precious metals, such as gold, are falling sharply. Gold is meant to provide protection in times of crisis -- but it appears that some investors are selling their bullion to cover losses on other financial positions. The pound is also falling, down over a cent against the US dollar at $1.276. That\u2019s its lowest level since last October, when Boris Johnson was renegotiating Britain\u2019s withdrawal agreement from the EU. Reuters is reporting that traders are ditching sterling in favour of safer currencies such as the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and the US dollar. Jonas Goltermann of Capital Economics predicts that the US central bank could be forced to slash interest rates, if the coronavirus epidemic worsens: The S&amp;P 500\u2019s 14% plunge this week is the fastest such correction on record; the VIX index is now at its highest level since the euro-zone crisis in 2012; and the 10-year US Treasury yield has fallen to a record low. These moves may force policymakers to respond whether they want to or not. The London stock market is staggering towards the sanctuary of the weekend, after another torrid session. Indeed, it\u2019s been a thoroughly awful week in the City, wiping more than 10% off blue-chip stocks. Here\u2019s David Madden of CMC Markets on the \u201cbrutal\u201d selloff: Equity markets in Europe have gone from bad to worse to awful as the selling pressure has gained momentum all week. What started out as a tumble on Monday has turned has turned into panic selling as traders are terrified about the possibility of Europe undergoing an economic slowdown or a possible recession because of the coronavirus. The fear of the unknown is causing traders to lose their nerve and just cut and run as far as stocks are concerned. The airline sector has endured a brutal sell-off this week as dealers took the view that travel would be greatly diminished on account of the coronavirus taking hold in Europe. It has been non-stop for the aviation industry as short-sellers stepped up their activity. Dealers\u2019 fears were confirmed today when, BA\u2019s owner International Consolidated Airlines Group, warned that demand will be negatively impacted, and that it will be hard to make a profit projection. Finn Air warned on profits on account of the health emergency, while easyJet said that flights will be cancelled. Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Wiesenthal has spotted something interesting.... Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s national economic council director, was doing his best to calm the markets, arguing the fall has gone too far. But he has a big problem here: Donald Trump. Usually presidents avoid taking credit for rises in the markets because they realize they know events beyond their control can wipe out those gains. Trump, however, has boasted time and again about how he has driven recent rallies in the markets. As criticism mounts about his handling of the outbreak, he runs the risk of owning the fall as well. Despite Larry Kudlow\u2019s best efforts, the Dow Jones industrial average is still DEEP in the red - currently down over 900 points (3.5%). Larry Kudlow, director of the United States National Economic Council, is trying to calm the markets. Kudlow has told reporters that the US economy is still sound, and is downplaying the impact of this week\u2019s rout. Speaking at the White House, Kudlow has suggested that \u201cshort-run corrections\u201d have been seen in the past, without causing major economic pain. Kudlow says: We\u2019ve been through this many, many times before. And I don\u2019t think, even though it\u2019s a front page story and no-one likes to see their asset values go down, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have much of an impact [on the wider economy]. He adds, though, that it depends how long the sell-off lasts and how deep it does. Here are more tweets from White House reporters: This tweet from Bloomberg\u2019s Michael McDonough shows how the US stock market turned south in recent days: Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway points out how historic this week\u2019s slump is: The S&amp;P 500, which give a broader picture of the US stock market, is having a torrid day - down another 3.5% right now. That takes the index deeper into correction territory, inflicting further heavy losses on investors. At 2,869 points, the S&amp;P 500 is on track for its lowest close since last August. Nearly every stock on the Dow is down, many heavily so. Major consumer-focused companies are among the top fallers, including Coca Cola (-5%), Procter &amp; Gamble (-5%) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (-4.8%). European stock markets are falling further, as traders watch the slump on Wall Street with alarm. In London, the FTSE 100 index has plunged by another 4.3%, or 290 points. That takes it down to 6506 points -- almost 900 points down this week. This puts the Footsie on track for its lowest close since July 2016, with one hour\u2019s trading to go. Holiday operator TUI is the top faller, down 9%. OMG. The Dow has shed another 1,000 points in early trading! This is the index\u2019s third quadruple-digit fall this week -- after its record fall (nearly 1,200 points) yesterday. It takes the Dow down to 24,766 points, wiping another 3.8% off the index. After falling into a correction last night, Wall Street isn\u2019t managing to find its feet at all. This is now the seventh day of big losses on Wall Street, and the sell-off is accelerating. Heavy selling has pushing the Dow below the 25,000-point mark for the first time since last June. The index is now down 922 points, or 3.5% -- as fears of a Covid-19 pandemic and a global recession hit stocks. Apple is leading the Dow fallers, down 5.4%, followed by JP Morgan (-4%) and Procter &amp; Gamble (-3.9%). Today\u2019s losses have pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to its lowest level since last June, as this chart shows: Newsflash: Stocks are falling sharply in New York, as the coronavirus market rout continues. The Dow dropped by 761 points at the start of trading. That\u2019s a drop of 2.96%, to 25,005 points The S&amp;P 500 is down just over 3%, and the technology-focused Nasdaq dropped by 3.1%. Just in: UK travel retailer On The Beach has warned it won\u2019t achieve market expectations this financial year, due to the coronavirus. It blames a \u201csmall but noticeable\u201d drop in demand for summer holidays, saying: The Group experienced a small but noticeable reduction in demand for Summer 2020 travel following the early reports of COVID-19 cases in early February. The reduction in demand has accelerated significantly following the increase in COVID-19 cases in Europe, particularly the spread of the virus to Tenerife. Whilst this reduction in demand has led to a natural reduction in marketing spend, the Board does not now expect the Group to achieve payback in the current financial year on its previously outlined strategic marketing investment. With less than 10 minutes until Wall Street opens, the future market is predicting fresh heavy falls. The Dow is currently priced to fall around 750 points, or another 3%. We\u2019ve also learned today that US personal incomes rose in January, but spending growth slowed. Associated Press reports: Americans pulled back on their spending in January, even as their incomes surged, a sign the economy was growing modestly before the threat of coronavirus arose. The Commerce Department said Friday that consumer spending increased 0.2% last month, down from 0.4% in December and the smallest gain since October. Incomes, however, rose 0.6%, the biggest rise in nearly a year, spurred by bigger paychecks and an increase in Social Security benefits stemming from a cost of living adjustment. Canada\u2019s economy barely grew in the last quarter of 2019, fresh data shows. Canadian GDP increased by just 0.1% in October-December, which highlights that the world economy was already weak, before the coronavirus struck. We already knew that the UK and Germany both stagnated during the quarter, while the French, Italian and Japanese economies shrank. The US grew by around 0.5%. There\u2019s no sign that this week\u2019s rout is over. The world\u2019s stock markets are either trading sharply lower (Europe), closed deep in the red (Asia-Pacific), or waiting nervously to open (US) Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is currently down 3% - or 204 points - at 6593 points. That\u2019s up from this morning\u2019s lowest points, but still another very hefty loss. It takes the index back to its December 2018 lows, and means it\u2019s down over 10% this week. But shares in jet engine maker Rolls-Royce are still up, around 6%, after it told reporters that its supply chain had not been disrupted by the coronavirus. CEO Warren East says: Building on the strength of our performance into the end of 2019, we are looking forward to 2020 with some degree of conviction and confidence. Not many other companies can say that today. US government bonds have hit fresh records today, as traders continue to sell shares and pile into less risky assets. This has pushed the yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Treasury bills below 1.2% - a record low. That would typically signal that investors are anticipating very weak growth, but also shows they\u2019re desperate to put their money somewhere safe. Roughly $5trn has been wiped off global stock markets this week, during the worst rout since the financial crisis. That\u2019s based on the losses suffered by the MSCI All-Country World Index, which covers roughly 85% of global equities. It had slumped by nearly 9% this week, even before today\u2019s losses, dropping to its lowest level since October. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Coronavirus panic sent world share markets skidding again on Friday, compounding their worst crash since the 2008 global financial crisis and pushing the week\u2019s wipeout in value terms to $5 trillion. \u201cInvestors are trying to price in the worst case scenario and the biggest risk is what happens now in the United States and other major countries outside of Asia,\u201d said SEI Investments Head of Asian Equities John Lau. \u201cThese are highly uncertainty times, no one really knows the answer and the markets are really panicking.\u201d Wall Street is expected to fall again when trading begins in two hours. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down 286 points in the futures market, or slightly over 1%. It has already lost nearly 2,200 points this week, taking the index down to 25,766 last night. There\u2019s so much uncertainty today, so we could see plenty of volatility. It\u2019s already the worst week for US stocks since the financial crisis. Palexpo have now confirmed that the Motor Show has been cancelled altogether (not merely postponed, as first thought). They are citing the legal principle of \u2018force majeure\u2019 -- unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract. Cancelling the motor show will cost the Geneva economy between \u20ac200m and \u20ac250m of lost spending, they say. It also appears that exhibitors will not be compensated, with Palexpo citing Switzerland\u2019s ban on large gatherings. Workers at the Palexpo exhibition centre in Geneva had been working hard to get the motor show ready for next week\u2019s opening - but have now downed tools. Here\u2019s the scene: It\u2019s official: the Geneva Motor Show has been cancelled. More to follow.... (updated: we initially thought it was only postponed). In other news, three former Barclays bankers accused of funnelling secret fees to Qatar in exchange for emergency funding at the height of the 2008 financial crisis have been found not guilty of fraud. More here: Reuters are reporting that the Geneva motor show will been cancelled, as we expected, following the ban on large gatherings in Switzerland. Here\u2019s the story: The organisers of the Geneva car show, Palexpo, have informed carmakers that the international auto show has been called off due to coronavirus concerns, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. A spokeswoman for Palexpo declined to comment. After two and a half hours of trading, European stock markets are still deep in the red. Fears of a global recession remain elevated. The main indices are all down over 3%, meaning we\u2019re still looking at the worst week since the financial crisis of 2008. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is still sharply lower too, although a little higher than its 3.5-year low struck this morning. Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, predicts that markets will remain volatile until there is some good news on Covid-19. Equity markets have finally caught up with what the bond markets have been signalling which is the clear threat of global recession as the coronavirus spreads and results in further disruption of supply chains, reductions in demand out output. Until there is a vaccine, the coronavirus will spread and market volatility we persist. US equities have made a 10% correction and it can easily end up being a 20%+ correction or \u201ccrash\u201d. The US 10 year Treasury yield has now fallen to a record low and further declines are likely. Helal Miah, Investment Research Analyst at The Share Centre, argues that investors should hunker down: \u201cWith the markets already down by 11% over a week, those who haven\u2019t already sold have obviously made losses and need to reconsider whether selling now is to risk missing out from a future recovery. A recovery will come but it may not necessarily be V shaped but more likely a U shape since the virus in the West is still spreading and we do not know the full economic fallout. However, the longer it takes to get over this crisis the more likely we are to see certain economies who are already weak, go into recession, I\u2019m thinking Germany and Italy as most likely. Monetary and fiscal stimulus will help with financial and economic confidence but it may do little for people who are afraid to catch a virus and avoid going out and spending money. \u201cWe take the view that from here, the best course of action may be for investors to sit tight and do nothing.\u201d Germany\u2019s central bank governor has warned that Europe\u2019s largest economy could miss its growth forecasts due to the coronavirus. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said this morning: \u201cAll in all, economic growth this year could come in slightly lower than our experts estimated in December.\u201d Those forecasts are already low - with the Bundesbank expecting just 0.6% growth in 2020. Germany\u2019s economy stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2019. A significant economic shock (as investors are fearing) would surely push Germany even closer to recession, or into one. And here\u2019s my colleague Jasper Jolly\u2019s story: It certainly looks like the Geneva Motor Show, which was due to run from 5-15 March, must be either postponed or cancelled: The official announcement from the Swiss Office of Public Health is online here (although their website is struggling right now). It says: In view of the current situation and the spread of the coronavirus, the Federal Council has categorised the situation in Switzerland as \u2018particular\u2019 in terms of the Epidemics Act. Large-scale events involving more than 1000 people are to be banned. The ban comes into immediate effect and will apply at least until 15 March 2020. The Federal Council is responding to the latest developments in the coronavirus epidemic and has categorised the situation in Switzerland as \u2018particular\u2019 in terms of the Epidemics Act. This enables the Federal Council, in consultation with the cantons, to order measures that are normally the responsibility of the cantons. In Switzerland, infections with the new coronavirus have confirmed in fifteen cases. There have been reports of diseases from the cantons: Ticino, Geneva, Grisons, Aargau, Zurich, Basel-City and Vaud. All persons have been infected abroad. Their health condition is good. All those who are ill are isolated.The public health authorities are contacting people who have been in close contact with the person infected. More than 500 people in Switzerland have so far been tested for the new coronavirus. Nose and throat swabs were taken and sent to laboratories for screening. A number of people are in quarantine in their canton of residence. They must stay at home and avoid contact with other people. The FTSE 100\u2019s latest tumble comes as UK officials announced they have now detected 19 cases of Covid-19, including the first cases in Wales. Our main coronavirus liveblog has all the details: Newflash: Switzerland has just banned large events expected to draw more than 1,000 people - a move that surely means the Geneva Motor Show will be cancelled. The Swiss cabinet says: \u201cIn view of the current situation and the spread of the coronavirus, the Federal Council has categorised the situation in Switzerland as \u2018special\u2019 in terms of the Epidemics Act \u201cLarge-scale events involving more than 1,000 people are to be banned. The ban comes into immediate effect and will apply at least until 15 March.\u201d Oil prices are also sliding again, on fears of a global recession. This has sent Brent crude below $50 per barrel for the first time in over a year. Newsflash: UK stocks have now slumped to their lowest level in three and a half-years. As the sell-off intensifies, the FTSE 100 is now down nearly 4.5% - or 300 points - at just 6495 points. That\u2019s its weakest level since July 2016, shortly after the Brexit referendum. It started this week at 7,404 points, before fears over the coronavirus hit the markets. It means the blue-chip index has now slumped by 12% this week. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe, says: Stock markets are well on their way to their worst week since the global financial crisis and there\u2019s no easing up, with losses on course to accelerate across Europe. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, describes today as \u201canother catastrophic day for investors\u201d. \u201cThis has been one of the worst weeks on the markets in a very long time, leaving investors\u2019 portfolios battered and bruised. \u201cThere is no sign of widespread bargain hunting by investors despite the cut-price shares on offer. That might not happen until there is a clearer picture of how far and wide coronavirus has spread and how different countries are trying to contain it.\u201d Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England governor, has warned that the Covid-19 outbreak could hit Britain\u2019s economic growth. In an interview with Sky News, Carney (who leaves the bank next month) said the UK is already feeling the impact - and it could get worse. He explains: What we are picking up with some of our bigger companies and companies around the world is that supply chains... are getting a little tight. That\u2019s lower activity. There\u2019s less tourism - as you can see on our streets here in the UK. That\u2019s lower activity as well. \u201cWe would expect world growth would be lower than it otherwise would be, and that has a knock-on effect on the UK. \u201cWe\u2019re not picking that up yet at all in the European and UK economic indicators, but if the world is slower than the UK, a very open economy, will have an impact.\u201d Virtually every company on the FTSE 100 is down this morning, with IAG now shedding almost 10%. The tech sector (-4.4%), miners (-4.3%), utilities (-4.25%) and consumer firms (-4.2%) are leading the rout. Only Rolls-Royce is defying the slump, after posting a 25% jump in underlying profits this morning. Bloomberg has calculated that six trillion dollars has been wiped off global markets since January 20th. That was the moment when the first human-to-human transmission of coronavirus was confirmed by Chinese authorities. Finland\u2019s national airline has added to the gloom, by warning that its profits will be hit hard by the coronavirus. Finnair has also scrapped its capacity growth target for this year, and hopes to slash \u20ac50m off its costs -- which could include temporary layoffs. Chief Executive Topi Manner said: \u201cAs the coronavirus situation has entered a new phase with outbreaks in several new countries, we will take appropriate measures to adapt our costs, operations and resources to better match our revenues.\u201d Today\u2019s early morning slump means the FTSE 100 is down around 800 points this week, or roughly 11% -- its worst performance since October 2008. There\u2019s still time for it to recover. But as things stand, the total losses this week are heading towards \u00a3200bn (it was \u00a3152bn last night). Newsflash: Britain\u2019s stock market has plunged by another 3.3% at the start of trading, to a fresh 14-month low. The FTSE 100 index has shed another 220 points, taking it down to 6582 points - its lowest level since December 27 2018. A week ago, the Footsie closed at 7404 points, before the coronavirus crisis triggered this week\u2019s selloff. Nearly every stock is down, some very sharply. British Airways owner IAG is the top faller, shedding 7% after it warned that Covid-19 was hurting its operations. Easyjet are down 5% after its announcement. Holiday firm TUI is also deep in the red, down another 5.7%. Mining companies are also being hit hard, with BHP Group and Antofagasta down over 5%. Demand for their iron ore and copper will slump if we enter a global recession. British Airways\u2019 parent company, IAG, has warned that its earnings outlook is \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the coronavirus outbreak. IAG has told the City that it is experiencing demand weakness on various European and Asian routes -- meaning it cannot give profit guidance for 2020 It has suffered a weakening of business travel, due to the cancellations of recent industry events such as trade shows, and \u201ccorporate travel restrictions\u201d. British Airways has already suspended flights to mainland China, and cut flights to Hong Kong, and is now cutting flights to Italy. These cutbacks will hurt IAG\u2019s capacity growth this year. It says: Capacity on Italian routes for March has been significantly reduced through a combination of cancellations and change of aircraft gauge and further capacity reductions will be activated over the coming days. We also expect to make some capacity reductions across our wider shorthaul network. Shorthaul capacity is not being redeployed at this stage. Budget airline easyJet has just announced that it is cutting some flights to Italy, due to the impact of the coronavirus. It is also cutting planning to cut costs -- by freezing \u201crecruitment, promotion and pay\u201d across its network, postponing non-critical spending, and cutting discretionary spending. Planes that would normally fly to Italy (where there are over 650 Covid-19 cases and 17 deaths) will be redeployed to other destinations. In a statement to the City, it says: Following the increased incidence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy, we have seen a significant softening of demand and load factors into and out of our Northern Italian bases. Further, we are also seeing some slower demand across our other European markets. As a result we will be making decisions to cancel some flights, particularly those into and out of Italy, while continuing to monitor the situation and adapting our flying programme to support demand. EasyJet has been badly hurt by this week\u2019s market rout, losing a third of its value, on fears that tourism to key destinations such as Italy will be badly hit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the finacnial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are in freefall again today as investors are gripped with anxiety that the coronavirus will trigger a global recession. Last night the UK, European and US stock markets all fell into corrections, more than 10% below their peak. The Dow Jones suffering its worst points fall ever - shedding nearly 1,200 points in a heavy, panicky wave of selling (its worst percentage fall in two years). Further heavy losses are expected today in Europe, with the FTSE 100 called down another 3%, or 210 points, to around 6575 points. That would take its weekly losses to over 1,000 points, the worst week since the financial crisis a decade ago. Other European markets are also facing another day of wild swings, with France and Germany both called down 3%. There have already been further heavy falls in Asia today, as traders respond to the news that Covid-19 has now been detected in Nigeria, New Zealand and Lithuania for the first time. There have also been a further 44 deaths in China, and 327 new cases, plus another 256 cases in South Korea as the human cost of the coronavirus mounts. Here\u2019s the situation in Asia: The Nikkei has closed down 3.67% in Tokyo In Sydney the ASX200 finished off 3.2%. The Kospi ended 3.6% worse off. Hang Seng currently down 2.65% Shanghai down 2.95% Oil is also under pressure, dropping another 3% to fresh one-year lows. The scale of the market plunge is truly shocking, as investors brace for a global pandemic: The markets are \u201cfluttering between risk aversion and full-on capitulation\u201d, says Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp. The full impact of the outbreak is still unclear. But if schools and offices around the globe are forced to close, and if Chinese factories struggle to reopen, then there will be a massive impact on growth. But such a gloomy scenario could be avoided. As Richard Clode of asset managers Janus Henderson puts it: A worst case scenario of a global pandemic would undoubtedly have a significant economic impact and given the fragile nature of the global economy could tip the world into recession. For now that remains a low probability outcome and our on the ground reports from an assortment of technology companies in China give us confidence that with the right measures in place the virus could potentially be contained. We\u2019ll be tracking all the market action through the day. We\u2019ll also be watching the latest US trade and consumer confidence data, plus Canada will become the final G7 country to report growth figures for the last quarter.
