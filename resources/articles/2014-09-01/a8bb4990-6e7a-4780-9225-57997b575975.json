Fine, maybe not the worst ones: I\u2019ve seen a whole quarter-hour of Real Husbands of Hollywood, after all. But the point stands that adapting one of the Coen brothers\u2019 most singular and celebrated comedies for the small screen seemed foolhardy on paper. Yet the Emmy-winning 10-parter Fargo (Fox, 15) is very much its own delight: not a remake, not exactly a spinoff, but a return visit to the 1996 film\u2019s skew-whiff Minnesota underworld that shares the Coens\u2019 taste for dark-blood deadpan without quite copying it. It\u2019s also the best showcase in many a year for the gruff peculiarity of Billy Bob Thornton, here on brilliantly insidious form as Lorne Malvo, a drifting contract killer who comes to the debatable rescue of an insurance-sales nebbish, wonderfully played by Martin Freeman at his most baleful and beleaguered. That\u2019s the central narrative thread, but there\u2019s grimly homespun crime and punishment to spare in this deep-pile tapestry, which arguably tackles loftier moral terrain than the film that inspired it, which, incidentally, is available on Netflix if you fancy a side-by-side midwestern wallow. Precious few of this week\u2019s film DVD releases, meanwhile, can be recommended without reservation. The best one by far, however, is a genuine one-off, at once dryly comic and dramatically rapturous. Icelandic first-time director Benedikt Erlingsson\u2019s Of Horses and Men (Axiom, 15) is a multi-stranded fable studying the complex kinship between the two eponymous breeds of beast, and the prismatic whole all but defies short-form description. It\u2019s safe to say that it features at least a couple of stunning images you haven\u2019t seen before, most vivid among them a furious episode of stallion-mare coitus, with a human rider still in the saddle. For context, and plenty of other transfixing horseplay besides, it\u2019s probably best to see for yourself. It\u2019s nearly four years since Bolivian curdled-family drama Southern District (Axiom, 15) surfaced fleetingly at the London film festival; belatedly arriving on DVD this week, it\u2019s elliptical slow cinema that merits investigation by patient adventurers. Domestic crisis bleeds beneath the surface of moneyed decor and everyday activity in a plush La Paz household, but director Juan Carlos Valdivia uses a still, penetrating camera to weed it out eventually. There\u2019s more going on, however, than there is in Before the Winter Chill (Metrodome, 15), a numbingly disappointing exercise in marbled French ennui from director Philippe Claudel, who previously excelled with Kristin Scott Thomas in I\u2019ve Loved You So Long. His redoubtable leading lady returns, this time opposite Daniel Auteuil; both soldier stoically through proceedings as a well-heeled couple at a marital crossroads, hungry for love and communication and anything resembling dramatic stakes. Even the dullness of Claudel\u2019s film is more comforting than the dead-eyed corsetry of In Secret (Sony, 15), a sudsy, tone-deaf adaptation of Emile Zola\u2019s 19th-century Parisian romance Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin that somehow turns stars as vital as Oscar Isaac and Elizabeth Olsen to balsa-wood cutouts; only Jessica Lange got me through, with her reliable hauteur and scarcely masked contempt for the entire enterprise. There\u2019s better news on the VOD front, as Raymond De Felitta\u2019s sprightly true-crime caper Rob the Mob, which was perfectly worthy of cinema exposure, nonetheless skips the big screen and heads straight toward a streaming outlet near you. (A DVD release, meanwhile, is scheduled for January.) De Felitta previously made the underrated New Jersey family comedy City Island, and his latest is similarly, winningly modest \u2013 Bonnie and Clyde played as tragedy-laced Bronx farce. Michael Pitt is cast interestingly against type as swaggering dimwit Tommy Uva, who briefly hit big with the novel moneymaking scheme of raiding mafia social clubs, but it\u2019s the incandescent Nina Arianda, as his brash, dubiously compliant girlfriend, Rosemarie, who romps off with the film. A star is born, if anyone cares to notice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
