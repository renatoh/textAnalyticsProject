The moves come after the chancellor yesterday warned that everyone would have to play their part to reduce the public deficit. He described announcements due tomorrow as the \"unavoidable budget\", claiming he faced the toughest test of any chancellor in history to prevent the country embarking on a \"road to ruin\". The Guardian understands that George Osborne is preparing to order a one-year freeze on council taxes for 2011/12 to reduce the strain on all liable households, but the freeze will be opposed by local government, which has so far suffered some of the worst budget cuts. The government's attempts to spread the burden of the four-year plan to tackle the deficit across all sections of society and to counter-balance public sector cuts with tax rises is facing intense opposition from unions, charities and industrial figures. In a BBC interview, Osborne promised a crackdown on the \"out of control\" welfare system, suggesting that public sector pay will be frozen beyond the expected one year and launching a review of public sector pensions, to be chaired by the former Labour minister John Hutton. Osborne insisted the budget measures would be spread fairly across society, suggesting capital gains tax will rise and promising a new banking levy. But he refused to be drawn on the vexed issue of a potential rise in VAT, which the Conservatives had privately committed to raising from 17.5% to 19.5% before the election. Osborne said he had designed the budget to ensure that everyone played their part in tackling the deficit, but last night that argument seemed to be failing to convince as he came under attack from industry, civil society groups and unions over the plans. The shadow chancellor, Alistair Darling, dismissed the planned cuts as an \"ideological war against the public sector\" and accused the Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition of having no growth strategy. A coalition of charities and trade unions \u2013 including Oxfam, Save the Children and the Trades Union Congress \u2013 will today call on David Cameron and Nick Clegg to honour pre-election pledges to cut the deficit without \"cutting back on fairness\". They say they are concerned that the measures will fall heavily on the poorest. Tim Nichols of the Child Poverty Action Group and spokesman for the bodies said: \"Despite promises of fairness from the coalition government, they appear to have no process in place for delivering it. We need to know why people on low incomes are being clobbered with cuts to free school meals and the future jobs fund while many higher up the income scale have barely felt a pinch.\" The group welcomed the promise of a bank levy and raising capital gains tax, but warned it would be undone if VAT goes up \u2013 especially on food. Osborne vowed to press ahead with increases in capital gains tax in tomorrow's emergency budget, despite acknowledging the moves would be deeply unpopular with core Conservative supporters and many industry lobby groups. \"What's controversial with some in my party is raising CGT,\" the chancellor told the BBC's Andrew Marr show yesterday. \"Here is a tax where at the moment we see massive income tax evasion, we see people shifting their income \u2026 and that's not fair given the current situation, so we'll deal with that.\" The move is understood to be a key win by the Lib Dems in the coalition. Meanwhile 110 entrepreneurs have published an open letter to the chancellor condemning \"a unilateral blanket increase in CGT, which would mean start-ups, talent, investment, jobs and tax revenues will head elsewhere over coming years\". According to Treasury calculations, a single percentage point rise in capital gains tax would raise just \u00a310m this year, rising to \u00a3130m the following year. The apparent hardening in the chancellor's language will raise many Conservatives' hackles, though a spokesman insisted Osborne had meant to say \"avoidance\" rather than \"evasion\" of the tax. Senior political figures, including David Davis and John Redwood, have already expressed deep concerns over draconian action planned by Osborne. Davis said: \"These are the people, not the rich, who will pay the lion's share of the increased capital gains tax. When they reach retirement age they will not be able to defer selling their share portfolio, holiday cottage or buy-to-let flat. They will need the money. So if we are not very careful, we will be punishing the virtuous.\" Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: \"The chancellor's approach is based on a series of myths. Deep, urgent cuts are not needed, and run the risk of the double dip \u2013 especially now much of Europe has signed up to the same deficit fetishism. Cutting spending now will do nothing to stimulate a private sector that is already running under capacity. The deficit can be easily financed as the UK's debt is long-term. \"Getting the fundamental budget judgment wrong will increase unemployment, particularly among young people \u2013 a million of whom are already on the dole \u2013 and hit the vital public services on which low and middle income households depend.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
