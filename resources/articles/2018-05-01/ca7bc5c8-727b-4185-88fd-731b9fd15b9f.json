According to the G1 news site, demonstrations continued on Monday in 25 states and the federal district of Bras\u00edlia, while in S\u00e3o Paulo, school buses and motorbike couriers joined the protests. New concessions announced by the president, Michel Temer, on Sunday night, including cutting taxes on diesel for 60 days, reduced tolls for empty trucks and minimum freight rates, initially appeared to have won over truckers. The Brazilian Truck Drivers Association \u2013 a key union that claims to represent 600,000 drivers \u2013 even said the strike was over. But truckers have yet to return to work. Some strikers said the deal was not enough. Others were unsure. \u201cAfter 60 days it will go back to how it is, with higher prices,\u201d said Edmundo de Souza, 36, a truck driver parked up with other strikers on a S\u00e3o Paulo highway. \u201cMost people here realise that there was a victory, but the decision whether to continue will be up to a vote,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rodrigues, leader of a group of strikers blocking Brazil\u2019s biggest port in Santos. On Sunday, the Estad\u00e3o news agency reported, a truck driver was shot in the head after trying to stop a truck avoiding a blockage in Esp\u00edrito Santo state. He was taken to hospital. Across Brazil factories have been forced to shut down. In S\u00e3o Paulo only a third of buses were running, queues for gasoline at petrol stations continued and schools and universities suspended classes. Supermarket shelves in central Rio were bare of fruit and vegetables, bus services were reduced, schools were closed and the city had an enforced holiday feel. \u201cIt\u2019s all empty there, take a look,\u201d said Marcos Colal, a supermarket manager in central Rio, gesturing at empty fruit and vegetables shelves. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any medicines delivered in a week, not one,\u201d said Paulo Galv\u00e3o, manager of a nearby pharmacy. \u201cI\u2019m very worried.\u201d Brazilians have been left shocked by the waste of food caused by strike \u2013 such as 300m litres of milk that the country\u2019s Dairy Products Association said had been thrown away, and 64m birds the Association of Animal Protein said had to be put down. It added that 1bn more birds were at risk. Economists have been calculating how much the strike will cost Brazil\u2019s battered economy, barely limping out of recession. Sunday\u2019s concessions alone will cost taxpayers nearly \u00a32bn. On Friday Temer sent in the army and federal police forces to help break the strike but while fuel deliveries from refineries for police, public transport and hospitals have been made with armed escorts, the army has avoided confrontation. On Sunday army commander, General Eduardo Villas Boas, tweeted that its \u201coperational guideline\u201d was \u201cnegotiation to avoid conflicts\u201d. In some towns in the south of Brazil, people have demonstrated in support of striking truckers and drivers. A minority of strikers even called for military intervention \u2013 a thorny subject in a country that spent 21 years under a right-wing dictatorship. \u201cI think that\u2019s the way forward,\u201d said Sonia Gouveia, 52, a striking school bus driver in S\u00e3o Paulo. Amid the political fallout, Temer\u2019s dismal popularity has plummeted further. His Sunday-night television address was greeted with pan bashing by incensed viewers in some cities. Yet his administration printed newspaper adverts on Monday to trumpet its \u201cconquests\u201d during two years in government. One was headlined \u201cWe advanced with Brazil\u201d, with a photo of a smiling woman in front of full supermarket shelves. Rafael Cortez, a political scientist and partner at S\u00e3o Paulo consulting outfit Tend\u00eancias, said Temer\u2019s claim to be leading an economic recovery looked increasingly shaky. \u201cThe Temer administration is almost a lame duck,\u201d he said.
