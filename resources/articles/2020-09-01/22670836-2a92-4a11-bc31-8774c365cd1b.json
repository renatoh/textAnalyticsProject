Britain has dropped 13 places in an annual study ranking the average broadband speeds of 221 countries and territories, placing it 47th fastest in the world. Last year, the UK ranked 34th for average broadband speed. The report, based on 577m broadband speed tests worldwide, now ranks the UK\u2019s average broadband speed as the eighth slowest in western Europe. Consumers in 21 countries, including major economies such as Spain, Germany and France, enjoy faster speeds. For consumers that means digital tasks such as downloading a film to watch take significantly longer, with the average broadband speed in the UK less than half that of the western European average. In the UK it takes on average 18 minutes to download a 5GB movie to watch, in Spain it takes just 12 minutes, Sweden eight minutes and Switzerland six mins. The UK\u2019s history as a global laggard in rolling out next-generation full-fibre broadband, which will provide internet speeds to future-proof the country\u2019s homes and businesses, is proving costly. According to Ofcom, just over 10% of UK households have access to it, compared with above 80% in many developed countries. \u201cThe UK is comparatively late in its rollout of pure fibre networks, which is causing it to stagnate while other nations gain ground,\u201d said Dan Howdle, consumer telecoms analyst at Cable.co.uk, which publishes the annual report. Many of the countries and territories that have leapfrogged the UK this year have comparatively small populations, such as Malta, Puerto Rico and Romania, and can roll out networks much more rapidly. \u201cIt is obviously easier to upgrade a country or territory to full-fibre the smaller it happens to be,\u201d Howdle said. \u201cHowever, the UK still finds itself a long way behind many nations of equal or greater size.\u201d Addressing the UK\u2019s laggard status was one of Boris Johnson\u2019s first priorities when he was elected prime minister. He wants a complete \u201cgigabit speed\u201d UK network, a combination of full-fibre and other super-fast technology used in Virgin Media\u2019s cable and broadband network, by 2025 and has pledged a \u00a35bn fund to support services reaching the most remote parts of the UK. This article was amended on 2 September 2020 to clarify that population size was being referred to when describing Romania as a smaller country than the UK. An earlier version also suggested Puerto Rico was a country, rather than a territory. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
