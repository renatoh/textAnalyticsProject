The black community took command of that word, and now when something is particularly good, we say, \"ain't that bad?\" I asked Willie Mitchell in the 1990s how his new collaboration with Al Green was going and he told me: \"Awful, man, just terrible.\" I hearkened back to seventh grade, 1973, the first year of catching the school bus in Memphis. \"When I say bad,\" the teacher instructed, \"I mean good.\" So prepare to answer \"yes\" when someone says to you, \"you know that's a bad part of town?\" \"Public transportation\" like \"progressive thought\" is one of Memphis's many oxymorons, so rent a car upon arrival \u2013 and disobey the instructions immediately by avoiding the expressway into the city centre and heading for Lamar Avenue and Payne's BBQ at number 1762. What's lacking in atmosphere at this converted gas station is made up for in the chopped-pork sandwich's sublime taste and texture. Get a hotel in downtown or midtown, far from the safe and freshly laid plastic of the east. The city has never looked better than from inside the American Dream Safari's 1955 Cadillac. The \"greatest hits\" tour will give you the lay of the land, and host Tad Pierson knows all the grittiest joints. Memphis music is about the blues, and how it became rock'n'roll and soul. If you must see Beale Street, the self-styled \"home of the blues\", the best music is usually the rag-tag band in Handy Park (200 Beale Street), playing for the afternoon crowd, whose moves evoke the street's less-regulated past. Then, for the real deal, head north to Wild Bill's (1580 Vollintine Avenue), an urban juke joint, where people come to dance, drink 40oz (two-pint) beers, and eat late-night chicken wings that reduce the belly's sloshing when you lie in bed. (You can bring your own harder spirits for a small fee.) The room glows with red Christmas lights and the memories of cigarette smoke, and the revolving band (often featuring members of the Hi Rhythm Section, who played on Al Green's hits) is as likely to play Elmore James as James Carr, Otis Spann as Otis Redding. Across town, Elvis impersonator Joe Kent performs his tribute show on Saturday nights at Dad's Place in the Clarion Motel (1471 East Brooks Road), and on Sunday nights there's an excellent soul blues revue, often with Ben Cauley on trumpet; he's the sole survivor of the plane crash Otis Redding died in. Memphis also remains a rocker's delight. Clubs only slightly larger than a garage \u2013 the Buccaneer Lounge (1368 Monroe Avenue) and the Hi-Tone (412-414 North Cleveland) are a couple \u2013 boast bands playing loud, hard and fast, like Jack Oblivian or the Dirty Streets, and also groups doing rootsier rock \u2013 the sultry Amy LaVere, or Alex Warble's various amalgams of folk, punk, and humour. You could spend the better part of a day kicking around the midtown corner of Cooper and Young, with its independent bookstore (Burke's, 936 South Cooper Street), record shop (Goner, 2152 Young Avenue), and crafts and kitsch emporiums. There's good food on the cheap (Young Avenue Deli, 2119 Young Avenue, with live bands at night) and also for finer palettes (Tsunami, 928 South Cooper Street); the Beauty Shop (966 South Cooper Street) has a bit of both. Next door is the DKDC Bar . Inside it's a cozy den of curtains, cloth and overstuffed chairs, often with small, offbeat combos playing. Nearer to downtown, don't miss Mollie Fontaine (679 Adams Avenue), a Victorian-era home serving up small plates, big drinks, and live music. If the weather's nice, wander over to the Levitt Shell in Overton Park (1928 Poplar Avenue). This open-air pavilion was home to pioneering blues festivals in the 1960s, and today hosts a range of sounds five nights a week during the spring and autumn. Bring a blanket, relax on the hill, and marvel at the communal groove in this city once divided by racial hatred. Those ill winds rarely blow any more, leaving only the art that was distilled from the oppression.
