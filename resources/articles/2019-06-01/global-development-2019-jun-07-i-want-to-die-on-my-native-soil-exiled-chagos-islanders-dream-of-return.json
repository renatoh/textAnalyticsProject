But small steps keep their campaign alive and it is hoped a documentary that will premiere on Saturday will exert pressure on the UK government to change its stance. Britain\u2019s ongoing occupation of the islands was declared illegal in February in an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d by the international court of justice at The Hague. Last month, the UN general assembly showed overwhelming support for a motion setting a six-month deadline for a withdrawal from the Chagos Islands so the archipelago could be reunified with Mauritius. Yet the islanders remain stuck in exile. After being evicted in the 60s and 70s, some Chagossians were given British passports in 2002; today, an estimated 3,000 second- and third-generation islanders live in Britain. The film, Another Paradise, by Belgian director Olivier Magis, documents a community in Crawley, West Sussex, home to Britain\u2019s largest Chagossian population. It will also be screened by public service broadcasters in Belgium, France and Finland. \u201cThe film serves to bring a shameful episode in Britain\u2019s post-colonial history out of the shadows,\u201d said Magis. \u201cWhen you listen to the arguments of the British government in the past few years, everything is justified. Politicians talk about relocation, not deportation, without mentioning what really happened and the way it happened.\u201d Sabrina Jean, 46, chair of the Chagos Refugee Group\u2019s UK branch, said she hoped the UN decision and the documentary, which will be shown at the Sheffield film festival on 8 and 10 June, would help: \u201cWe know the UN decision is not binding. I don\u2019t know yet what will happen but Chagossians will not sit down. We will fight for our rights.\u201d Jean\u2019s father, 68-year-old Serge Aristide, was among the 1,500-plus people forced to leave the British overseas territory when it was leased to the US to build a military base in Diego Garcia. They were taken in boats to Mauritius and the Seychelles without relocation assistance, and most lived in poverty. Jean moved from Mauritius to the UK in 2006. \u201cSabrina is full of hope, full of optimism and I hope that anyone who struggles will be inspired by her,\u201d said Magis. \u201cShe left school at 16, she is an NHS cleaner, but she fights against the US and the UK. She uses all the small tools she can find everyday, to help her community, to organise cultural events, to remember the creole culture. She has nothing but she gives everything. In French, we call it the strategy of the little steps. \u201cMy hope is that this will strike a chord with UK and US audiences. The Chagossians are a very small community. They don\u2019t have any money and the UK government are playing a waiting strategy \u2026 waiting until the third or the fourth generation are rooted in UK soil and they will forget.\u201d Much of the documentary was filmed in 2016, a crucial year, when the US lease for the Diego Garcia military base was scheduled to end. But, in a crushing defeat for the islanders, Alan Duncan, the foreign secretary at the time, confirmed a ban on resettlement to the islands. What had happened was \u201cdeplorable\u201d, Duncan said, but the government had decided against resettlement, on the grounds of \u201cfeasibility, defence and security interests, and the cost to the British taxpayer\u201d. The relocation of 1,500 people was estimated to cost \u00a3256m. Serge Aristide, who was 17 when he was forced to leave Peros Banhos, one of the Chagos islands, said his soul would not rest until he went home. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be buried in the land of the colonisers,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to die on my native soil, where I\u2019ll be surrounded by native fish, sharks, turtles, rays, silk snapper, ruby snapper \u2026 here my soul can rest.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
