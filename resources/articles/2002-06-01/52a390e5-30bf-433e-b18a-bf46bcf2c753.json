Chewing up and spitting out the Glamorgan attack, the Surrey glutton did even more lasting damage to the record books by thrashing 268 - the highest innings ever played in a one-day game of any consequence. Discarded after reaching 50 only twice in 16 internationals, Brown, whose modest physique belies the power of England's most exhilarating batsman since Ian Botham, scored his runs off 160 balls, leaving Graeme Pollock's 222 not out for Eastern Province against Border in 1974-75 whimpering in the distance. Yet Brown was philosophical about England. \"I've had my day today,\" he said. \"I have been playing well and this is the first time we have had a good one-day wicket. It was nice to cash in with a good score. \"They [England's selectors] go with what they want. I had a chance last year and I think they made their decision on two games.\" Surrey stacked up 438 for five, another world limited-overs high. It is a measure of both feats that the previous English one-day peaks - 206 by Alvin Kallicharran, 413 by Somerset - were against minor counties. All the more astonishing, then, that Glamorgan should reply in kind. In the least bowler-friendly contest in the 40-year history of the abbreviated game, the visitors, ignited by centuries from Robert Croft and David Hemp, faced the last three balls requiring 12 to win. Pride stinging after bowling the most charitable spell in one-day annals - 108 off nine overs - Darren Thomas biffed 71 off 41 deliveries. Fatally, however, he lost the strike midway through the final over. Adam Hollioake's next two balls cleaned up Andrew Davies and Dean Cosker. As well as being by far the highest total ever made by a side batting second in a one-day game, Glamorgan's 429 took the match aggregate to an unprecedented 867 - 160 more than when Surrey made 350 on the same ground in a 1994 semi-final against Worcestershire and still lost. A key factor was the short boundary on the gasholder side - at 60 yards, 10 more than the minimum, it was less than half the usual distance away. Brown took due toll with 30 fours and 12 sixes. Even Saqlain Mushtaq, the planet's finest short-form spinner, saw his first six overs disappear for 56. The previous most generous one-day spell had been C C Lovell's two for 107 for Cornwall against Warwickshire in 1997 - off 12 overs. Croft, pinch-hitting, was even quicker on the draw than Brown, hitting 20 from the first over bowled by Martin Bicknell and hurtling to three figures off 57 balls; Brown required 80 for his first hundred. Even more improbably, by the time Hollioake saw Croft off for 119 off 69 balls - 90 in boundaries - the chasers were ahead of the required rate. The decisive over was suitably surreal. Thomas swung Hollioake's third ball for six - 12 to get. Cue a wide before Thomas ran a leg-bye, leaving the final word, fittingly, to Hollioake. After all the sadness of his past few months, he was probably the only one remotely capable of coolness. Quarter-final draw Kent v Gloucestershire Essex v Yorkshire Sussex v Surrey Somerset v Worcestershire Matches on July 16 and 17 Record haul \u00b7 Brown's innings of 268 beat the previous highest individual score in limited-overs cricket, 222 not out by Graeme Pollock for Eastern Province against Border in 1974. \u00b7 It broke the previous English best of 206 by Warwickshire's Alvin Kallicharran against Oxfordshire in 1984. \u00b7 Brown plundered 30 boundaries and a dozen sixes in a 160-ball innings. \u00b7 Surrey's 438 for five is a record in world cricket, bettering Somerset's 413 for four against Devon in 1990. \u00b7 Glamorgan's Darren Thomas bowled three for 108, the worst nine-over spell in limited-overs history. \u00b7 The English limited-overs match aggregate record of 707 set by Worcestershire (357) and Surrey (350) at the Oval in 1994 was also broken, by 160 runs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
