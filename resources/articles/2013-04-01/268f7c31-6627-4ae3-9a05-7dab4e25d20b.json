By the time a new artistic director arrives in 2015, large swaths of the once controversial building will have been redesigned. Last week we were given a taste of what is to come. The Shed has landed. It's one of the theatrical events of the year. This temporary replacement for the Cottesloe will remain until 2014, when the National's smallest auditorium will appear remodelled and (aaargh \u2013 what a pity that the National could not acknowledge a philanthropist without turning away from its history) renamed the Dorfman. It's a scarlet glory, a red square rammed against the grey concrete block of the main building. Built of raw steel and plywood, it smells of timber. You can step, Narnia-style, into its bar from the Lyttelton foyer, whose lights and people provide the heating. Long bulbs dangle down like red-hot pokers. Corrugated plastic brings in daylight; every now and then you're confronted by the concrete of the National's walls. This is a building that opens your heart before you get into the auditorium. It's a building that enables invention. Hurrah for Haworth Tompkins. There is now a generation of audiences who won't remember what theatres were like before this inspiring firm of architects shook them up and opened them out. Before 2000 the Royal Court did not have its big red drum, the Egg in Bath had not been hatched, the Young Vic was all bunched up, Battersea Arts Centre's different rooms were closed in on themselves. Haworth Tompkins have made theatres more welcoming, more continuous with life outside. They started reshaping the stage when site-specific work was beginning to boom, reminding audiences of the importance of the places in which we see plays. Their impact has been as great as that of an artistic director. Haworth Tompkins's reconfigurations continue one of Hytner's achievements, an unfolding of diverse spaces for work unfamiliar to the National, in which terraces, riverside areas and interstices have been used as play areas by pyrotechnicians and performance artists. The Shed is designed to house different new work. It is not true to say that Table, the first play to be staged there, would not fit into any other auditorium. But it does belong in the temporary arena, not least because the Shed itself is shaped like an upside-down table. In a way, Tanya Ronder's play is a surprise as an inaugural piece. It is not swaggeringly cutting-edge. It's glorious: warm, thoughtful and deceptively straightforward \u2013 in other words, marvellously clear. Using the most solid of traditional family artefacts \u2013 a wooden table, scored with initials and hacked with knives \u2013 it tumbles through some 200 years and six generations of one family. What could be more conventional, more telly-epic? Well, nearly everything. The families that inherit the table include a gay couple, a nun who gives herself to a leopard-hunter, and a commune in which the inhabitants have bad hair and not much better faith. They gather round it to eat and squabble, but they also bonk on its top, wee on its surface, and use it as a place both for giving birth and for laying out the dead. Rufus Norris's production glows. A terrific cast pull together and away from each other with the affection, contempt and disappointment of family members. Apart from the table, the stage is bare but full of change, quickening and dying under Paule Constable's lighting, made solemn or gleeful by the singing of hymns and nursery rhymes. The theatre can gain from offstage affinities. Red Velvet profited from combining the wife-and-husband talents of writer Lolita Chakrabarti and actor Adrian Lester. In Ronder and Norris, Table also employs the talents of two partners. The result carries a particular emotional charge. After all, who better than a married couple to stage a work about the perils and pleasures of the family? There is no such thing as a play that is made for the Lyttelton. How could there be when this was the auditorium that displayed the conflagratory Jerry Springer: The Opera? Yet during the Hytner years, Howard Davies's expansive but sharply detailed productions of the Russian repertoire \u2013 among them The White Guard and Philistines \u2013 have been a motor for this theatre. Trevor Nunn may have begun the exploration of Slavic life beyond Chekhov with his exquisite production of Summerfolk, but it has greatly expanded under Tsar Nicholas. Now Davies directs Gorky's 1905 Children of the Sun, written when the dramatist was under arrest for anti-government activity, puts cholera, chemistry and revolt on the stage. Or, rather, talks about them. A group of interrelated professional people, incubating various doomed romances, are used to demonstrate inspired self-absorption and powerless vision. An obsessed experimenter doesn't notice his wife's chemistry with a local artist; his jangled sister scents revolution in the air but her poetic laments are futile. Illness spreads through a village; the inhabitants seek scapegoats in the intellectuals in the big house. This is fascinating as a document, less so as drama. It explains rather than enacts. Separate stories don't ratchet each other up. This is Gorky's fault, not Davies's. His intricately choreographed production suggests a society so packed that it must implode. The cast weave in and out of each other, are glimpsed through glass spying on each other, and speak over each other \u2013 often a boon in Andrew Upton's aggressively anachronistic version. Bunny Christie supplies a sumptuous, design, with receding vistas through sliding doors. Lucy Black makes an outstanding National debut, utterly feral and yet utterly restrained. There is an incendiary coup de theatre and a lovely piece of lunatic symbolism when the cast juggle and smash a basket of new-laid eggs. Unfortunately you don't quite get an omelette as a result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
