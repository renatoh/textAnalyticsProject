One of the teams they are due to play in the preliminary rounds of the tournament is currently in disarray. No it's not Australia, who seem to have adjusted to the departure of Shane Warne as if it was a mere pinprick. But India's batsmen are desperately out of sorts. They hinted at their lack of confidence as they crawled just past 200 against lowly Holland in Paarl on Wednesday, but at Centurion against proper bowlers they were routed. One of the most eagerly anticipated matches in the preliminary round - there aren't many to whet the appetite this week - was a barren anti-climax for a capacity crowd. It was all so simple for the Australians after Ricky Ponting conveniently lost the toss. The Australians, who had changed their line-up, bringing in Darren Lehmann and Michael Bevan for Ian Harvey and Jimmy Maher, also changed their opening combination. They decided to toss the ball to Brett Lee rather than Jason Gillespie, and like everything else that Australia tried yesterday, the ploy worked. Lee stormed in on a pitch of generous bounce. Sachin Tendulkar could handle him, but no one else could. In their different ways they were all hapless. Since playing on seaming tracks in New Zealand, India's batsmanship has disintegrated. Sourav Ganguly attempted a few exotic shots. Once or twice he shimmied down the pitch to Glenn McGrath (for some reason he chose not to adopt that strategy against Lee), but he rarely made contact with the ball. Then Lee fired a short-pitched ball outside Ganguly's off-stump. His feet were still glued on the crease; he wafted and edged to Adam Gilchrist. India had just one over of supremacy, the seventh of the innings, when Tendulkar with a selection of exquisite strokes, gleaned 14 runs. If wickets had not tumbled rapidly at the other end, Tendulkar might have enchanted us, but none of his colleagues looked like keeping him company. The ball that Virender Sehwag edged would have been a wide if he had had the discretion to leave it alone. The first two wickets had fallen from outrageous attacking shots. Even more worrying was the fact that when Rahul Dravid came to the crease, he was beaten consistently when he was trying to defend. Now that is a bad sign. Dravid was eventually bowled for a 23-ball single by Jason Gillespie's first ball. It was a good one, which Dravid dragged on to his stumps. Thereafter Gillespie didn't bowl any bad ones. He was so superbly on target that Ponting allowed him to bowl his ten overs straight through, conceding just thirteen runs and taking two more wickets. Soon Mohammad Kaif, attempting to hook, was duped by an intentional short ball. But the wicket that he will treasure is that of Tendulkar's. He bowled his off-cutter. Tendulkar may have spotted it; he tried to flick the ball on the leg-side but missed it, and the most prominent Englishman in the tournament so far, David Shepherd, raised his finger - correctly. Once Tendulkar had gone, it was just a question of how long we would be detained at Centurion. Harbajhan Singh was typically diverting; he sliced Lee for a four and a six to third man and swished merrily when Ponting eventually brought on his spinners. But if the despair of the Indians and sharpness of the Aussies needed highlighting the final dismissal - that of Javagal Srinath - did the trick. By now Darren Lehmann was hobbling, but he stayed on the field since he was bowling. Kumble pushed the ball to his left and Lehmann, though restricted to one leg, grabbed the ball and threw the stumps down. Even a crocked Aussie was too much for the Indians. The Australian response was routine. It took them a mere 22.2 overs to knock off the 126 runs required, and the match finished almost two hours early despite an elongated lunch interval. Both the left-handers sprinted away. Eventually Adam Gilchrist sprinted past the ball and was stumped by Dravid, but Ponting soon revealed himself to be in fine form. So in Group A there are just two sides sitting pretty: Australia look invincible. Their chief concern is that they are peaking too early. There is a trend in World Cups that those who start in blistering form fade away. In recent times Pakistan (in 1992) and Australia (in 1999) struggled early and sprinted to the line. Elsewhere there are some gloomy captains around. Ganguly looked pretty miserable last night, though in this field I think Hussain still has the edge.
