At the end of the second season of the BBC's acclaimed modern reimagining of Sherlock Holmes, our hero leapt from the top of a London high-rise, only to re-emerge in the shadows at his own burial. In a seven-minute teaser episode released on Christmas Eve, no further clues were offered to explain Sherlock's improbable feat. Still, the BBC knows exactly what its viewers want for Christmas: something to tide us over until the third season starts in the new year. \u201cSherlock has been gone for two years. But someone isn't quite convinced that he's dead \u2026 #SherlockLives,\u201d the BBC teased from its YouTube account. The short video, entitled Many Happy Returns, sets the stage for Sherlock (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) to return to London. His friends still think he's dead; his sidekick Watson (Martin Freeman) even wound up in therapy. As Many Happy Returns begins, we find that a series of crimes across the globe, from New Dehli to Germany, have been solved by almost impossible means. The pattern hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. Back in London, Detective Anderson \u2013 never a big fan of Sherlock\u2019s \u2013 has been tracking the cases. \"He\u2019s out there. He\u2019s hiding, but he can\u2019t stop himself from getting involved,\u201d he insists to Inspector Lestrade over a pint. Lestrade isn\u2019t convinced. But that doesn\u2019t stop him from visiting Watson, who\u2019s spending his days alone with a glass of fine spirit, and giving him an uncut version of a video greeting Sherlock recorded for Watson. Watson pops in the disc, and we see Sherlock pacing and whining as he considers the what to say. But only at the end, is the real message clear. \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you again very soon,\u201d Sherlock drawls. At that precise moment, the doorbell rings. Watson hits pause and gets up to answer the door. Moments later, the video begins to play again, and we see Sherlock offering the camera a wink and a sly, knowing grin. Will Sherlock reveal himself right away, or will he let his colleagues solve the mystery themselves for once? Who hit the play button? Was it Sherlock popping by to say hello, or is a new, unseen enemy at the door? Does that moment even matter at all, or are we reading too much into this? We could probably come up with better theories, but we\u2019re all a bit busy freaking out. Fret not \u2013 we\u2019ll soon have the answers: Sherlock premieres in the UK on 1 January, 2014. US fans will have to wait until 19 January, 2014, when it will air on PBS."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
