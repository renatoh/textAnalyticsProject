Apart from his documentaries on Afghanistan or his energetic defence of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal on any radio station that would have him, few people outside of Westminster knew much about the Eton-educated Black Watch veteran. Yet in the past 12 hours his campaign team say they have received earnest enquiries from backers of both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove about potential jobs \u2013 not for Stewart, but jobs that might be available in a future Stewart administration. The MP for Penrith and the Border came a shock fourth in the Tory leadership contest on Tuesday, making it to the next round with 37 votes, an increase of 18 since last week. Victoria Prentis, one of his earliest backers, who has been doing numbers for the Stewart campaign, said she was overjoyed. \u201cMPs told us they were really starting to get traction from their constituents, they were starting to get what we are trying to do,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has a different way of communicating, but it is really getting through to people\u2019s constituents. He really can do this.\u201d Stewart\u2019s campaign has ruffled the positioning of his rivals. \u201cIt is fair to say that Rory Stewart ruined almost everyone\u2019s initial plans,\u201d a member of a rival Tory leadership camp said. One of Stewart\u2019s team said most MPs initially believed his campaign was \u201ceither a joke or just a \u2018suicide bomber\u2019, as it was impolitely put for another candidate like [Michael] Gove \u2026 but it\u2019s been in the last week where people have realised this is really serious.\u201d For a man whose background includes Eton, the Foreign Office and, possibly, the intelligence services, Stewart has done well to paint himself as the outsider rather than Javid, the Rotherham-born son of a Pakistani bus driver. He has overshadowed both Matt Hancock and Dominic Raab\u2019s claim to be the fresh face of the party\u2019s future, taking apart the latter\u2019s unwillingness to rule out proroguing parliament. His viral Twitter and video campaigning have made his other rivals look cautious and old-fashioned. One MP said they believed Stewart had identified one place that Tory MPs would definitely be watching. \u201cTwitter is the worst place to campaign to win over the general public, but this is different, Tory MPs are obsessively monitoring it,\u201d the MP said. \u201cAnd really, what other choice did he have? \u201cEvery MP will say yes to a personal chitchat with Boris; if Rory had tried that same tactic, he would have flunked. Most colleagues might not even have bothered to watch a standard campaign launch speech if he\u2019d done one.\u201d While Gove and Jeremy Hunt have issued attacks on rivals\u2019 \u201cseriousness\u201d or suggested one candidate could be divisive \u2013 both code for Johnson \u2013 Stewart has been prepared to outflank them, at one point openly questioning whether Johnson could be trusted with the nuclear codes. Stewart says he has been told by other campaigns that his willingness to float his policy ideas to members of the public on his walks around the country has scuppered some of their plans for major announcements. One campaign was reportedly planning to launch the idea of a national citizens service after months of debating its merits. Stewart breezily announced his version on handheld camera after a walkabout in Derby. His campaign benefited at the start from low expectations, and for days leading up to the first vote his tally of supporters was in single figures. When he met the threshold he looked like the insurgent because so many had assumed he would be knocked out. Stewart\u2019s unexpected success was the nail in the coffin for Hancock, who had hoped to hoover up Stewart\u2019s supporters in the next round but instead found his base being cannibalised. One big gain for Stewart\u2019s campaign has been the support of the justice secretary, David Gauke, a heavyweight who has been prepared to go out to bat for him on the airwaves and on Twitter, where he has made spicy comments about the fitness of Johnson to steward the economy. The campaign has also won the support of David Lidington, the deputy prime minister. \u201cLidington was obviously a huge gain for us, we are the only ones picking up those high-profile backers in recent days apart from Boris,\u201d one source on the Stewart campaign said. Other MPs will point out that his supporters are not anything like a solid bloc vote, more a ragtag of those on the party\u2019s centre-left, remain supporters, the last of the Theresa May loyalists and some personal friends. One MP, a member of the One Nation group of Tory centrists, which was founded by Amber Rudd, said they could never back Stewart because he was so divisive. \u201cHe effectively told one half of the party that they are stupid,\u201d the MP said. \u201cThat is not how you unite the party. He seems to care far more about winning likes on Twitter than persuading colleagues that he can heal the party\u2019s wounds and beat [Labour\u2019s Jeremy] Corbyn.\u201d Stewart\u2019s backers believe he will have transformed the contest, win or lose. \u201cHe shows the potential for the Conservative party to broaden its base and he has injected some realism into the debate around Brexit. That has changed the terms,\u201d one campaign source said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
