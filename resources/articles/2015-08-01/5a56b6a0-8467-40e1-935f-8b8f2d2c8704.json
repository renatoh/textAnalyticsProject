But with Wednesday\u2019s noon deadline for becoming eligible to vote looming, a breakdown of the London \u201cselectorate\u201d released by Labour\u2019s London region takes much momentum out of such mutterings. According to these figures about 84,000 people are presently eligible to take part in the mayoral ballot, comprising roughly 59,000 party members, 18,500 registered supporters and, bringing up the rear, 6,500 affiliated members, the majority from Labour-linked unions. The numbers in the last two categories could yet go up substantially as late joiners are verified. Labour says that some 20,000 of the party members have joined since May\u2019s general election, many perhaps preferring the full package to the \u00a33 right to vote. Ballot papers will begin being sent out from Friday and the result of the vote, to be conducted under the alternative vote system, will now be announced on 11 September. The media herd\u2019s moo du jour is of entryism by Greens, Outer Leftists and smartarse Conservatives, all hoping Islington\u2019s own Jeremy Corbyn will become Labour\u2019s new leader, albeit not all for the same reason. Labour is saying that nationally at least 1,200 members or supporters of other parties have been excluded from voting with another 800 being probed. About one fifth of that 1,200 are in London, I hear, which means round about 250 metropolitan duds so far. That\u2019s not a lot out of 84,000 (and rising) and they\u2019ve been purged anyway. Checking will continue, but it all looks pretty healthy at this stage. Let\u2019s be cheerful for a change. On Monday night in Croydon I had the privilege and joy of chairing the final hustings of the mayoral candidate race. A packed audience provided many stimulating questions which got some pretty good replies from Diane Abbott, Christian Wolmar, David Lammy, Sadiq Khan, Gareth Thomas and, standing in for Tessa Jowell who had a prior engagement elsewhere, Andrew Dismore AM. I\u2019ll share some of the detail in the coming days - it\u2019s hard to take notes when you\u2019re in the chair, and although I captured the entire thing on tape it may take me a while to find the courage to endure the living hell of listening to the sound of my own voice. For now, though I can report that the event confirmed for me that Labour\u2019s mayoral candidate battle has made its leadership contest look tired and tame, at least until the Corbyn Factor - which might have an impact on the mayoral contest too - proved to be something much more potent than an Olde Tyme novelty act. True, some of the would-be candidates have had a lot to say about things they would campaign for or against as mayor but would not, alas, actually be able to do given the uneven package of powers and resources they would have at their disposal. But that is all part of the job, and as the weeks have gone by each of the six has succeeding in defining a distinctive programme despite the quite narrow policy options bossing City Hall provides. They all have things to recommend them. None of them has been dull. You can\u2019t ask for too much more. Update, 12 August, 2015. This article was amended at 12:25 to better reflect the likely late increase in registered supporters and affiliated members eligible to vote. The Wednesday noon deadline for registration has been extended to 3:00 pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
