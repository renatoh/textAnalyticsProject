I sacrifice myself at its altar occasionally, for the reader. But it\u2019s always far too sweet and somehow too needy (eat me, eat me!). There have been really good white bars - Solkiki\u2019s So Woke, was a recent example. \u2013 and I\u2019d eat them, but usually I wouldn\u2019t choose white. Yet I hoped that one day, the perfect white bar would present itself. And then it happened. I had contacted Dormouse chocolate saying I\u2019d like to order some of their bars, but I was just too lazy to choose, so what three bars did they recommend? And one of the ones they recommended was the 38% Toasted White (with criollo/trinitario beans from Madagascar and with a conch time of 48 hours. I love this level of detail. If you\u2019re going to nerd out about chocolate, you need to know everything) because it was \u2018a classic\u2019. I was reluctant to hand over \u00a36 for a 70g bar of white chocolate, which I would probably taste one square of but, thank the Lord, I did. Dormouse chocolate bars are wrapped in beautiful paper wrappers \u2013 you could wallpaper a room with them, and give yourself diabetes, if you bought enough of them. The foil inside has that perfect, nostalgic crinkle crankle to it. The chocolate is a dark tan colour due to the toasted milk used. And then the taste \u2013 smooth, creamy, biscuity, caramelly and all those other adjectives that make you want to eat eat eat. Amazing and delicious and sweet, yes, but in a grown-up way. Perfection found. dormousechocolates.bigcartel.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
