He might also have cited Lawrence's report on what is now Iraq in the Sunday Times of August 22 1920, in which he wrote: \"The people of England have been led in Mesopotamia into a trap from which it will be hard to escape with dignity and honour. They have been tricked into it by a steady withholding of information. \"The Baghdad communiques are belated, insincere, incomplete. Things have been far worse than we have been told, our administration more bloody and inefficient than the public knows. It is a disgrace to our imperial record, and may soon be too inflamed for any ordinary cure. \"We are today not far from a disaster ... The cabinet cannot disclaim all responsibility. They receive little more news than the public: they should have insisted on more, and better. They have sent draft after draft of reinforcements, without enquiry.\" Readers may feel that Lawrence's words have considerable contemporary relevance. Prof Martin McKee London While Simon Jenkins is as right as always about contemporary Iraq and the causes of the present mess there, he is historically inaccurate in believing the Lawrence of Arabia legend that it was Feisal's Arab forces that captured Damascus. Elie Kedourie proved long ago that it was Allenby's British and Australian troops that made the crucial difference, and that the so-called Arab capture was a sop to Lawrence and his local forces. Churchill failed the Iraqis in 1921: sadly we did so again in agreeing with Rumsfeld and his kind in 2003.
