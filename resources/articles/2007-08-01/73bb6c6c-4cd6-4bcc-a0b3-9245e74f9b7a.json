Beckham, captaining the Galaxy for the first time, shook off his recent ankle problems to score his first goal for the club - a trademark free-kick in the 23rd minute - and later set up the other for Landon Donovan as they beat DC United 2-0 in the SuperLiga semi-final. He was substituted in the 63rd minute but the performance will do the former Real Madrid and Manchester United midfielder's chances of a 97th England cap no harm, with the 32-year-old expected to be named today in McClaren's squad for the friendly with Germany at Wembley next Wednesday. \"I was happy to get an hour on the pitch,\" said Beckham. \"I didn't expect to last an hour but it felt great after 10 minutes into the game. \"It was important for me to actually get on the pitch and play some minutes. I think that was the most important thing for me. Once I'm on the pitch, I know I can play well and help the team and that's all that was on my mind tonight, helping the team and helping us get into a final and helping get our season under way.\" \"The free-kick was the first I've taken for eight weeks, so it was quite pleasing,\" he added. \"I felt I was going to score as soon as I had the ball in my hands.\" Beckham had played just 37 minutes as a substitute in two previous games because of a nagging left ankle injury that meant his first full training session with the Galaxy was not possible until Tuesday. \"It was a good strike,\" said the DC United coach Tom Soehn. \"He's been scoring goals all over the world like that.\" AP"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
