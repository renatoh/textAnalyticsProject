Well, I've done it and it works well. The trouble is that articles like his can overegg the pudding. Seager tries to make a financial argument for what is really an energy-saving choice. And his attempt to present a case for one technology misses the real point about energy saving - you've got to look at the whole house and lifestyle. If you spend more than \u00a33,000 on solar power simply as an investment, you may well be disinclined to fork out more for other energy-saving measures, such as insulation, draft-proofing, water-saving devices or a new boiler. Like Seager's solar hot water example, we spent about \u00a33,600 on a 4 sq metre system which is estimated to generate 1,600 kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year. It's been running for a year and the results seem good. We hardly use the gas boiler in the summer, and in the past 12 months we've used about 4% less gas than we did in our previous house (which was much smaller) the year before. But since we've got lots of insulation and a new efficient \"condensing boiler\", it's hard to tell by how much solar power is contributing. The case presented was peppered with best-case scenarios: \"The payback time is still long, at 15 years or more.\" We save a maximum of \u00a350 a year on an outlay of \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000 - that's 60-70 years, not Seager's 15. The payback figure and yield of more than 4% assume a hefty saving of \u00a3100 a year in maintenance costs just thanks to the solar panels. Is there evidence for this? It could easily be wiped out with a couple of unforeseen breakdowns. Evidence, Seager says, \"suggests solar power can add nearly 9% to a property's value\". This means that a recent valuation of our house, at about \u00a3500,000, would make the solar panels worth more than \u00a340,000 - which really seems pie in the sun-filled sky. As for photovoltaic panels, the main issue, if you actually want to \"walk the walk\", as the article puts it, is space. In order to generate the 1,800 kWh over a year in the example quoted, you'd need at least 12-15 sq metres of south-facing roof. Great - if you've got it. My beef with much of this message is not with the intention. I support solar, let's have more of it. But let's get the story right. Solar panels aren't a fashion accessory or an investment, they're one way of trying to hold back our relentless increase in energy consumption. Consumers should focus on the whole of their energy use. Policy-makers should think how realistic information can be made available to householders about their property's energy-saving potential. Council environmental departments must work with planners. Efficient condensing boilers are now mandatory if an old boiler is being replaced. Builders, plumbers and architects all need to understand the new energy pressures. When we renovated our house we looked into numerous different types of energy saving. Websites and lobby groups abound, but few are familiar with the whole picture. Solar is only part of that picture - and it's still pretty expensive. \u00b7 Julian Stern has solar panels on his roof julianstern@yahoo.com \u00b7 The Response column offers those who have been written about in the Guardian an opportunity to reply.
