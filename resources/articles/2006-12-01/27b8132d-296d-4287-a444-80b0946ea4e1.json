Just three weeks after snatching the broadcasting veteran from the BBC, Britain's biggest commercial broadcaster said advertising revenues at its main channel were down some 12.5% this year. ITV1's audience share also slipped to 33.3% from 36.7% a year earlier as it battles a slew of new digital channels. But the home of X Factor and Coronation Street said it still remained Britain's most popular channel in peak time with 27.3% of the adult audience, compared with 24.5% for BBC1. Since the autumn schedule began that share is up to 29%. Strong growth at the company's digital channels such as ITV2 saw revenues leap 40%, offering some compensation for falling terrestrial advertising. John Cresswell, who is ITV's interim chief executive until Mr Grade takes over as executive chairman on January 8, said: \"2006 trading remains in line with current market expectations and, whilst the airtime sales environment remains challenging, our digital channels continue to perform strongly.\" The group noted \"strong growth from regional television advertising\" and confirmed that spending on programmes would be kept at about \u00a31bn in 2007. Mr Grade has so far given little away about how he plans to use ITV's programming budget, saying merely that he wanted to create \"the most loved, the most relevant, the most creative broadcaster\". The departing BBC chairman is seen by City investors as one of the few people capable of turning around ITV but they stress it will be a hard ride. Sam Hart, at the brokers Charles Stanley, said: \"There is considerable hope that he will be able to slow the decline in advertising revenues and audience share at ITV1. The continued fragmentation of audiences and the proliferation of digital channels, however, means he faces an immense challenge.\" City analysts had low expectations for ITV and were unsurprised by the double-digit fall in ad revenues at the main channel. There was also guarded optimism about the strong growth in revenues at the digital channels, albeit with the concern that such a small part of the overall group cannot make up for the slump at ITV1. One problem is that advertisers must be compensated for falling revenues under a mechanism known as contract rights renewal. A sharper than expected slump in audience share - highlighted by ITV's house broker UBS - would thus have a knock-on effect on ad revenues next year. The broker cut its rating on the broadcaster's shares to \"reduce\" from \"neutral\" and dropped its price target to 100p from 105p. The shares closed down 2p at 107.5p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
