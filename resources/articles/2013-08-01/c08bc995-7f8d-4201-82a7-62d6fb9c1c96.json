Laying out the FA's position on the matter for the first time, Dyke said it was impossible to play in Qatar's summer heat. The Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, said recently that moving the tournament to winter would cause \"chaos\" across world football, because the entire calendar would have to be altered for three seasons, and vowed to do all he could to stop it. Dyke said that a move to winter or stripping Qatar of the tournament were the only options given that it was practically impossible to play a football tournament in temperatures of 50C. Of the two options, he said he thought the former more likely. \"I don't know how many people have been to Qatar in June. I have. The one thing I can tell you is you can't play a football tournament,\" said the former BBC director general, who took up his post last month. \"Even if all the stadia are air-conditioned \u2013 which seems a bit strange in terms of the green policy \u2013 it would be impossible for the fans. Just go out there, wander around in that sort of heat. The FA's position will be you can't play it in summer in Qatar. \"Fifa therefore has two choices: you either move it in time or to another location. I suspect either ends up in some sort of litigation but then someone should have worked that out in 2010 when it was awarded.\" The Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, has flip-flopped on the issue after Qatar were controversially awarded the 2022 World Cup in December 2010. But he recently said it should move to winter and promised to put the issue before the executive committee in October. The English and German leagues have been loudest in their opposition, while a move to winter could also open up the possibility of legal action from Australia and the USA, who were defeated in the 2022 vote. Scudamore has said the Premier League will do \"all the lobbying we can\" to ensure that the tournament is not moved to winter. Dyke said he understood the Premier League's opposition to the winter move but believed it was becoming increasingly inevitable. \"I have some sympathy with them. They didn't have to choose to give it to Qatar in the summer but that's where it is. It will either have to be moved out of the summer or to another location. I suspect the former is more likely than the latter.\" Dyke also predicted that England would qualify for the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil without the need for a play-off, but admitted that more needed to be done to make the national set-up more integrated. \"We are now going through a process where we are appointing the under-21 manager and looking at the way it works. I spoke with Alex [Horne, general secretary] and it needs to be more joined up, the FA and football structure, than it is now, right the way from young kids through,\" said Dyke, a former Manchester United director and Brentford chairman. \"We need to make it very clear which tournaments we are going to take very seriously. In the summer I didn't think we made that clear and that was a mistake.\" In the summer, his predecessor, David Bernstein, and the England manager, Roy Hodgson, prioritised a friendly in Brazil over the under-21 championships in Israel, which ended in England eliminated in the group stages. But Dyke will insist on a more holistic approach in line with the rhetoric that accompanied the construction of St George's Park for all of England's national teams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
