The organisers of the London protest - CND, Stop the War Coalition and the Muslim Association of Britain - hailed a \"wonderful\" turnout of between 80,000 and 100,000 people, although police put the figure at 15,000. Demonstrators in the capital braved a bitterly cold Saturday to march from the houses of Parliament to Trafalgar Square. But the biting wind did not stop them exposing their thumbs to the elements as they texted their names to a petition calling for the creation of an international tribunal into the Iraq war. The total of the signatories was constantly updated on an electronic screen that was moved from Parliament Square to outside the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square. By the end of the march more than 2,000 signatures had been registered. While the headcount may have been lower than on earlier anniversaries, the number of issues being debated seemed well up on previous years. On placards and in chants Iraq vied for prominence alongside the Palestinian intifada, Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the international community's tense relationship with Iran, nuclear energy, atomic weapons, the rule of Robert Mugabe, and Tony Blair's stewardship of the NHS. Matthew Williams, a 31-year-old student from Texas, said he had come to protest about the US government's \"imperialistic attitude\" to world affairs. \"I'm just calling for an end to the occupation of Iraq,\" he said. \"I have opposed it from the start. When the war broke out I was protesting in Houston and now I'm protesting here.\" His sentiments were echoed by Maz Cook, a project manager for an independent media organisation. \"What's happening in Iraq is disgusting,\" she said. \"It has been a victim of western imperialism for decades and its people have only ever known war, so it's no wonder they're turning to terrorism. It's hard to know what to do about it all, that's why I have come down here.\" Iqbal Warsi, who had travelled to London with her husband from Cambridge, said that Israel's treatment of the Palestinians was fuelling much of the demonstrators' anger. But she added: \"We're also here because of what is happening in Iraq and Iran. Two world wars have taught us nothing.\" Other marchers had other reasons. A woman dressed as a teapot drifted between the the orange jumpsuits and Che Guevara banners, exhorting the crowd to \"make tea not war\". In Iraq several hundred oil workers staged a rally in Basra to protest about the US occupation and the privatisation of the oil industry. A protest in Baghdad was cancelled because of security fears. Around 1,000 people gathered in New York's Times Square on Saturday, and twice that number protested in Tokyo. There were other protests in Madrid, Rome, Dublin, Istanbul, Chicago, Toronto, Sydney, Karachi, Dhaka, Seoul and elsewhere. In France the anniversary of the war was eclipsed by protests against a controversial new employment law, which brought 500,000 people on to the streets of Paris."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
