Root was not part of England\u2019s 3-0 win in the Twenty20 series, but the 29-year-old still harbours a burning ambition to make the squad for October\u2019s World Cup. He believes trying to match the power-hitters has been detrimental to him and now hopes his finesse will prevail. However, Test cricket remains the primary focus and Root remains on course to become the first Englishman since Johnny Douglas in 1920-21 to lead two Ashes campaigns down under. Mike Brearley twice led tours of Australia, but the urn was not at stake during the hastily arranged 1979-80 series. When asked how much he is thinking about the Ashes, Root said: \u201cThere\u2019s no point hiding from it or trying to make it look like we\u2019re not focused heavily on it, because we are. A lot of thought and planning has gone into things. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not looking at what\u2019s coming up this winter [tours to Sri Lanka and India] and, while they\u2019re not similar conditions, some of the challenges we\u2019ll face will stand us in good stead when it comes to walking out at the Gabba. \u201cGuys will be readying themselves for that, the opportunity of a lifetime. We have a good chance to build up for it. [The drawn home Ashes series in 2019] was difficult, with the World Cup beforehand. But there\u2019s no excuses this time. Get it right and we could be in a really strong place going out there.\u201d Root\u2019s first Ashes series as captain three years ago resulted in the urn being meekly surrendered in a 4-0 defeat. The vice-captain, Ben Stokes, was absent following the infamous Bristol incident, a boozy narrative dogged the tour and Ricky Ponting struck a nerve when comparing Root\u2019s soft-spoken leadership to \u201ca little boy\u201d. Root said his captaincy has grown since then. \u201cI was still getting to grips with the role. Off the back of it I had quite a difficult year, maybe not reflected in terms of results [England beat India 4-1] but trying to work out what method sat best with me and what suited the team best in terms of how we want to play. \u201cIn the last year or so we\u2019ve settled. That\u2019s given us something to draw back to and compare ourselves against, rather than just thinking about outcomes all the time. It will be tested in Sri Lanka and India but that\u2019s exciting. Keep improving and it\u2019s another string to our bow when it comes to Australia.\u201d Root will pay \u201ca huge amount of attention\u201d to Australia\u2019s forthcoming Test series against India that begins on 17 December in Adelaide, with nine Tests against the latter next year and the home side set to hand debuts to two promising rookies. David Warner\u2019s groin injury means the 22-year-old Will Pucovski is due to open following 495 runs in three Sheffield Shield innings, while in Cameron Green they have a new all-rounder whose batting has drawn comparisons with Ponting and, though returning from a stress fracture, bowls fast-medium from a 6ft 7in frame. \u201cIt will be brilliant to watch two of the best teams in the world going at it, but also the immediate challenges of India, the conditions in Australia and a few new players,\u201d Root said. \u201cAll the information we can gather will be vital.\u201d Looking at the immediate challenge of South Africa in 50-over cricket, however, Root has three shots at ensuring 2020 is not his first full calendar year in international cricket without a century in any format. \u201cI\u2019ve not hit my straps the way I\u2019d like to \u2013 in Test cricket in particular \u2013 but having had this break, I\u2019ve looked at a number of things to change and work on. You have times when your game is tested, you have to adapt and that\u2019s where I am now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
